40|$|Introduction Promoting the {{assessment}} of health interventions using outcomes that matter to patients and practitioners is a key principle of Cochrane. Cochrane UK therefore commissioned the OMIPP project: Outcomes that are Most Important for Patients, Public and Practitioners to identify the outcomes they felt most important and should be evaluated in Cochrane reviews of health interventions for Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS). Methodology Using direct emailing, social media and printed cards, an online survey was distributed {{to a wide range}} of people involved in the care of patients with CRS. Patients and practitioners were asked to list the 3 outcomes from treatments most important to them. Responses were analysed through development of a thematic framework based on the data. Results Two hundred and thirty-five people completed the survey; 155 practitioners and 80 patients. Respondents provided 653 suggestions of important outcomes. 73 % concerned symptoms of CRS, (nasal discharge or drip, facial pain, nasal blockage, headache, impaired sense of smell, congestion and breathing difficulties); 9 % concerned quality of life, 4 % reducing the need for further treatment and 4 % side effects of treatment. Objective measurements of disease formed only 3 % of responses. There was high level of agreement between patients and practitioners. Of 10 current Cochrane reviews on CRS, 9 include symptomatic outcomes identified by our survey as most important to patients and healthcare practitioners. Discussion We have identified outcomes that both patients and their doctors consider should be included in reviews evaluating treatments of rhinosinusitis. We recommend that primary outcomes in future reviews focus on symptom-based outcomes.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the quantum optical {{properties}} of disordered semiconductors have been investigated. After merging together the latest results {{of two different}} fields, namely semiconductor optics and disordered semiconductors, {{we were able to}} describe the interaction of the quantized light field and the disordered semiconductor at a fully microscopical level. We have used a one-dimensional tight-binding model. The underlying Hamiltonian describes free electrons and photons, the Coulomb interaction and the light [...] matter interaction at dipole level. Disorder is taken into account by varying the energies of sites. The effect of lattice vibrations (phonons) has been omitted and the microscopic electron [...] electron scattering has been included by a phenomenological damping parameter. Absorption and photoluminescence spectra are determined by the time evolution of the microscopic polarization and photon assisted polarization, respectively. Thus we derived the general equation of motion for the purely electronic and photon assisted polarization of the disordered system. Applying the cluster expansion for these quantities we have truncated them at single-particle level, i. e., Hartree [...] Fock level. Assuming stationary carrier populations we have given an analytical solution for both equations of motion. The solution of the equation of the motion of the polarization {{turned out to be the}} famous Elliott formula of absorption and we have obtained a similar expression for the photoluminescence spectrum, too. Evaluating our analytical results numerically, we have investigated the Stokes shift, the influence of direct and indirect nature and of disorder on photoluminescence spectra, the thermodynamic relation of absorption and luminescence and the lifetime distribution. We have seen that the disorder induces a Stokes shift, which depends on the temperature of the carriers and on the Coulomb interaction. The latter does not change the presence of the Stokes shift, it only decreases its size through enhancing the optical matrix elements for the low-energy transitions. The temperature has turned out to be the other essential parameter, since the Stokes shift considerably decreases or even disappears for high temperatures. The analysis of the direct and indirect nature has shown that disorder obviously destroys the original electronic structure of the material and the underlying direct or indirect nature can no longer be distinguished in photoluminescence spectra for strong enough disorder. On the other hand, we find it remarkable that even for relatively large disorder the spectra still differ clearly from each other. The temperature is important here as well, since this difference is more pronounced at low temperature. In the case of the thermodynamical relation between absorption and luminescence disorder plays a crucial role. Our results have shown that stronger disorder leads to smaller or even vanishing deviations of the calculated luminescence from its thermodynamical value. In our lifetime distribution study we have proved that the Coulomb interaction does not play a significant role if a short-range disorder potential is present. A transition from a log-normal to a power-law distribution has also been formed as the disorder increases. In the last Chapter of the present thesis the angular photonic correlation has been investigated. After the derivation of the polarization [...] polarization correlation function U_ħω(Δ q) we have analytically shown for an ensemble of independent two-level systems that U_ħω(Δ q) carries all information on the spatial position of emitters as well as the complete disorder potential. The method of how <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>these</b> <b>data</b> from the correlation function has also been presented.

We found that immunodepletion of PP 2 A or inhibition of PP 2 A by okadaic acid (OA) inhibits initiation of DNA replication by preventing loading of the initiation factor Cdc 45 onto prereplication complexes. Evidence was provided that PP 2 A counteracts an inhibitory protein kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates a crucial Cdc 45 loading factor. Here, we report that the inhibitory effect of OA is abolished by caffeine, an inhibitor of the checkpoint kinases ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein (ATM) and ataxia-telangiectasia related protein (ATR) but not by depletion of ATM or ATR from the extract. Furthermore, we demonstrate that double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) cause inhibition of Cdc 45 loading and initiation of DNA replication and that caffeine, as well as immunodepletion of either ATM or ATR, abolishes this inhibition. Importantly, the DSB-induced inhibition of Cdc 45 loading is prevented by addition of the catalytic subunit of PP 2 A <b>to</b> the <b>extract.</b> <b>These</b> <b>data</b> suggest that DSBs and OA prevent Cdc 45 loading through different pathways, both of which involve PP 2 A, but only the DSB-induced checkpoint implicates ATM and ATR.

In organello translation experiments using purified mitochondria from young seedlings demonstrated accumulation of ORF 239 only when a protease inhibitor was included. Proteolytic activity against ORF 239 was observed in mitochondrial extracts, fractionating with the mitochondrial inner membrane. A serine type protease, similar to the LON protease of E. coli, was cloned from the Arabidopsis genome (AtLON) and demonstrated proteolytic activity against ORF 239 in vitro, with features resembling the activity detected in mitochondrial inner membrane preparations. Antibodies generated against the cloned, overexpressed LON homologue reduced proteolytic activity against ORF 239 when added <b>to</b> mitochondrial <b>extracts.</b> <b>These</b> <b>data</b> suggest that ORF 239 is undetected in vegetative tissue due to rapid turnover by at least one mitochondrial protease that acts against ORF 239.

I have also studied a second means of pvs-orf 239 regulation in common bean lines that have undergone spontaneous reversion to fertility. This reversion to fertility is associated with the shifting to substoichiometric levels of the DNA molecule containing pvs-orf 239. In vitro mitochondrial incubation results demonstrated that the genomic shift of the pvs-orf 239 -containing molecule to substoichiometric levels upon spontaneous reversion was a reversible phenomenon. Moreover, I have demonstrated that substoichiometric forms, apparently silent with regard to gene expression, are transcriptionally and translationally active once amplified. ...|$|R

Data mining {{is considered the}} technology <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> knowledge from <b>these</b> <b>data.</b> With an ever increasing amount of data and complexity of modern data mining applications, the demand for resources is rising tremendously. Grid and Cloud technologies promise {{to meet the requirements}} of heteroge-neous, large-scale and distributed data mining applications. The DataMiningGrid system was developed to address some of these issues and provide high performance and scalability, sophisticated support for different types of users, flexible extensibility features, and support of relevant standards. While the DataMiningGrid, like most of the related grid systems, fo-cused on compute-intensive applications, Google’s MapReduce paradigm and Cloud-Computing brought up new solutions for efficient data analysis. Based on the DataMiningGrid, we developed the DataMiningGrid-Divide&Conquer system that combines these important technologies into a general-purpose data mining system suited for the different aspects of today’s data analysis challenges. The system forms the core of the Fleet Data Acquisition Miner for analyzing the data generated by the Daimler fuel cell vehicle fleet. Keywords-Data mining, Grid, MapReduce. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{integration}} of multidimensional data and machine learn-ing {{seems to be}} natural {{in the area of}} business intelligence. On-Line Ana-lytical Processing (OLAP) tools are frequent in this area where the data are usually represented in multidimensional datamarts and data mining tools are integrated in some of these tools. However, the efforts for a full {{integration of}} data mining and OLAP tools have not been as common as originally expected. Nowadays, this integration is mostly carried out on source code, implementing solutions that perform i) all the operations on multidimensional data as well as ii) the data mining algorithms <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> knowledge from <b>these</b> <b>data.</b> Hence, there now exists an impor-tant distinction between implementation-based developments where the entire solution is implemented on source code and OLAP-tool-based de-velopments where (at least) the operations on multidimensional data are performed using an OLAP tool. This work analyses these two alterna-tives in cost-effective terms, performing an experimental analysis on a multidimensional problem and discussing when each approach seems to excel the other...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The growing {{computerization}} {{in modern}} academic and industrial sectors is generating huge volumes of electronic data. Data mining {{is considered the}} key technology <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> knowledge from <b>these</b> <b>data.</b> Grid and Cloud technologies promise to meet the tremendously rising resource requirements of heterogeneous, large-scale and distributed data mining ap-plications. While most projects addressing these new challenges have a strong focus on compute-intensive applications, we introduce a new paradigm to support the development of both compute- and data-intensive applications in heterogeneous environments. Combined storage and compute resources {{form the basis of}} this new approach as they allow programs to be executed on resources storing the data sets and thus are the key to avoid data transfer. A data-aware scheduling algorithm was developed to efficiently utilize all available resources and reduce data transfer of global data-intensive applications as well as support compute-intensive applications. Based on the results of the DataMiningGrid project we developed the DataMiningGrid-Divide&Conquer system that combines this approach with current Grid and Cloud technologies into a general-purpose data mining system suited for the different aspects of today’s data analysis challenges. The system forms the core of the Fleet Data Acquisition Miner for analyzing the data generated by the Daimler fuel cell vehicle fleet.

40|$|Data Mining {{is an idea}} {{based on}} a simple analogy. The growth of data {{warehousing}} has created mountains of data. The mountains represent a valuable resource to the enterprise. But <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> value from <b>these</b> <b>data</b> mountains, we must &quot;mine &quot; for high-grade &quot;nuggets &quot; of precious metal-the gold in data warehouses and data marts. The analogy to mining has proven seductive for business. Everywhere there are data warehouses, data mines are also being enthusiastically constructed, {{but not with the}} benefit of consensus about what data mining is, or what process it entails, or what exactly its outcomes (the &quot;nuggets&quot;) are, or what tools one needs to do it right. Data Mining as a field is not yet through with the process of definition and conceptualization of the scope of the field. There are at least three distinct concepts of data mining being used by practioners and vendors. DMI: Data mining is traditional data analysis methodology updated with the most advanced analysis techniques applied to discovering previously unknown patterns. A specific instance of this concept, stated more explicitly and with a more commercial orientation is provided by the SAS Institute. SAS defines data mining as the process of selecting, exploring, and modeling large amount...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{mutagenesis}} of 1,N 6 -ethenoadenine (εA) and 8 -oxoguanine (8 -oxoG), two endogenous DNA lesions {{that are}} also formed by exogenous DNA damaging agents, have been evaluated in HeLa and xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV) cell extracts. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the duplex M 13 mp 2 SV vector containing these lesions established that there was significant inhibition of replication fork movement past εA, whereas 8 -oxoG caused only minor stalling of fork progression. In extracts of HeLa cells, εA was weakly mutagenic inducing all three base substitutions in approximately equal frequency, whereas 8 -oxoG was 10 -fold more mutagenic inducing primarily G→T transversions. <b>These</b> <b>data</b> suggest that 8 -oxoG is a miscoding lesion that presents a minimal, if any, block to DNA replication in human cells. We hypothesized that bypass of εA proceeded principally by an error-free mechanism in which the undamaged strand {{was used as a}} template, since this lesion strongly blocked fork progression. To examine this, we determined the sequence of replication products derived from templates in which a G was placed across from the εA. Consistent with our hypothesis, 93 % of the progeny were derived from replication of the undamaged strand. When translesion synthesis occurred, εA→T mutations increased 3 -fold in products derived from the mismatched εA: G construct compared with those derived from the εA: T construct. More efficient repair of εA in the εA: T construct may have been responsible for lower mutation frequency. Primer extension studies with purified pol η have shown that this polymerase is highly error-prone when bypassing εA. To examine if pol η is the primary mutagenic translesion polymerase in human cells, we determined the lesion bypass characteristics of extracts derived from XPV cells, which lack this polymerase. The εA: T construct induced εA→G and εA→C mutant frequencies that were approximately the same as those observed using the HeLa extracts. However, εA→T events were increased 5 -fold relative <b>to</b> HeLa <b>extracts.</b> <b>These</b> <b>data</b> support a model in which pol η-mediated translesion synthesis past this adduct is error-free in the context of semiconservative replication in the presence of fidelity factors such as PCNA...|$|R
