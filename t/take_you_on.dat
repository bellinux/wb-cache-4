2500|$|With Primrose having recovered, Travis regrouped and re-evaluated. Moving into {{a cottage}} in Crear, Argyll and Bute, {{they set up}} a small studio, and over two weeks, came up with nine new songs that would form the basis of their fourth studio album, 2003's 12 Memories.

Yet it also saw them lose ground in the U.S., where Coldplay had usurped Travis during their 2002 absence. Much later, Fran Healy spoke about the album as a whole being about him working through his own clinical depression, and the 12 memories being 12 reasons for him reaching his depressed state.
