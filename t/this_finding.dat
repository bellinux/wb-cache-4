50|$|While {{this work}} has been widely cited, {{it has not been}} non-controversial.

5|$|Based on morphology, John McEachran and Neil Aschliman {{determined}} in a 2004 phylogenetic study that Platyrhinoidis and Platyrhina together form the most basal clade {{of the order}} Myliobatiformes, and are thus the sister group to all {{other members of the}} order (encompassing stingrays and their relatives). <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> affirmed that the thornback guitarfish is not closely related to the true guitarfishes of the family Rhinobatidae, a possibility that had long been considered by taxonomists.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Scottish {{toxicologist}} John Duffus {{reviewed the}} definitions used {{over the previous}} 60 years and concluded they were so diverse as to effectively render the term meaningless. Along with <b>this</b> <b>finding,</b> the heavy metal status of some metals is occasionally challenged {{on the grounds that}} they are too light, or are involved in biological processes, or rarely constitute environmental hazards. Examples include scandium (too light); vanadium to zinc (biological processes); and rhodium, indium, and osmium (too rare).|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} the broader {{evolutionary}} relationships between the giant freshwater whipray {{and the rest of}} the family Dasyatidae, a 2012 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial DNA reported that it was most closely related to the porcupine ray (Urogymnus asperrimus), and that they in turn formed a clade with the mangrove whipray (H. granulata) and the tubemouth whipray (H. lobistoma). <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> adds to a growing consensus that the genus Himantura is paraphyletic.|$|E

5|$|Nathan Lovejoy's 1996 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} morphology, {{found that the}} yellow {{stingray}} is the most basal member of a clade that also contains Pacific Urobatis species and the genus Urotrygon of Central and South America. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> would render Urobatis polyphyletic, though further study is warranted to elucidate the relationships between these taxa.|$|E
5|$|Seal {{impressions}} {{found in}} Peribsen's tomb at Abydos show several deities: Ash, Min and Bastet, suggesting they were venerated during Peribsen's {{time on the}} throne. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> argues against Peribsen worshipping a single god, or promoting monotheism. The heretic theory of Newberry, Černý, Grdseloff and others was devised from the very limited archaeological information available during their lifetimes. Most of the found clay seal impressions were still undeciphered and untranslated at their time.|$|E
5|$|Some studies shows {{correlation}} of reduced hippocampus volume and {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD). A study of Vietnam War combat veterans with PTSD showed a 20% reduction in the volume of their hippocampus compared with veterans having suffered no such symptoms. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> was not replicated in chronic PTSD patients traumatized at an air show plane crash in 1988 (Ramstein, Germany). A 2016 study strengthened theory that a smaller hippocampus increases the risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, and a larger hippocampus {{increases the likelihood of}} efficacious treatment.|$|E

5|$|The first Devonian {{tetrapod}} identified from Asia {{was recognized}} from a fossil jawbone reported in 2002. The Chinese tetrapod Sinostega pani was discovered among fossilized tropical plants and lobe-finned {{fish in the}} red sandstone sediments of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of northwest China. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> substantially extended the geographical range of these animals and has raised new questions about the worldwide distribution and great taxonomic diversity they achieved within a relatively short time.|$|E

The concept of viral load is introduced, and we discuss the usefulness of viral load in the clinical prognosis of this disease, and its use as an aid in the decision-making process when starling or mordifyng antiretroviral therapy in our patients.

5|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{was that the}} silver iodide would cause supercooled water in the storm to freeze, disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane. This led to the seeding of several Atlantic hurricanes. However, it was later shown that this {{hypothesis was}} incorrect. It was determined that most hurricanes do not contain enough supercooled water for cloud seeding to be effective. Additionally, researchers found that unseeded hurricanes often undergo the same structural changes that were expected from seeded hurricanes. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> called Stormfury's successes into question, as the changes reported now had a natural explanation.|$|E

5|$|Cold {{air from}} the {{remnants}} of a cold front became entrained within the circulation; however, the cold air gradually warmed. On October9, winds increased to gale-force and the depression was upgraded to a subtropical storm, at which time it was given the name Bravo. By October10, Bravo had intensified substantially, as hurricane hunters recorded hurricane-force winds roughly 15mi (25km) {{from the center of the}} storm. Following <b>this</b> <b>finding,</b> the National Hurricane Center reclassified the system as a tropical system and renamed it Fran, dropping its previous designation of Bravo. Upon becoming tropical, Fran developed a strong outflow and several convective feeder bands. Additionally, the storm had developed a 35mi (55km) wide eye.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequencing}} of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes yielded relationships quite different; the three New World pelicans formed one lineage, with the American white pelican sister {{to the two}} brown pelicans, and the five Old World species the other. The Dalmatian, pink-backed and spot-billed were all closely related to one another, while the Australian white pelican was their next-closest relative. The great white pelican also belonged to this lineage but {{was the first to}} diverge from the common ancestor of the other four species. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> suggests that pelicans evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas, and that preference for tree- or ground-nesting is more related to size than genetics.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{also can}} be {{evaluated}} by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in blood samples. EP {{is a part of}} red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the blood is high, with a delay of a few weeks. Thus EP levels in conjunction with blood lead levels can suggest the time period of exposure; if blood lead levels are high but EP is still normal, <b>this</b> <b>finding</b> suggests exposure was recent. However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood lead levels below about 35μg/dL. Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in iron deficiency, use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.|$|E
