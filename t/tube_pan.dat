50|$|Normally angel food cakes are {{baked in}} a straight-sided <b>tube</b> <b>pan,</b> but similar pans {{such as a}} bundt pan are acceptable. It is very {{important}} that the pan does not have a non-stick surface and that no grease is applied to the sides or around the tube. As the cake bakes, it expands and rises. The sides and hollow center tube act as supports for the foam as it expands. The hollow pan also allows for an even heat distribution.|$|E
5000|$|Sponge cakes (or foam cakes) {{are made}} from whipped eggs, sugar, and flour. They rely {{primarily}} on trapped air in a protein matrix (generally of beaten eggs) to provide leavening, sometimes {{with a bit of}} baking powder or other chemical leaven added as insurance. Sponge cakes are thought to be the oldest cakes made without yeast. An angel food cake is a white sponge cake that uses only the whites of the eggs and is traditionally baked in a <b>tube</b> <b>pan.</b> The French Génoise is a sponge cake that includes clarified butter. Highly decorated sponge cakes with lavish toppings are sometimes called gateau; the French word for cake.|$|E
50|$|Angel food cake {{is usually}} baked in a <b>tube</b> <b>pan,</b> a tall, round {{pan with a}} tube up the center that leaves {{a hole in the}} middle of the cake. A bundt pan may also be used, but the fluted sides can make {{releasing}} the cake more difficult. The center tube allows the cake batter to rise higher by 'clinging' to all sides of the pan. The angel food cake pan should not be greased, unlike pans used to prepare other cakes, this allows the cake to have a surface upon which to crawl up helping it to rise. After baking, the cake pan is inverted while cooling to prevent the cake from falling in on itself. Angel food cake is sometimes frosted but more often has some sort of sauce, such as a sweet fruit sauce, drizzled over it. A simple glaze is also popular. Recently, many chefs (Alton Brown in particular) have popularized the idea of adding aromatic spices such as mace and cloves to the cake.|$|E

50|$|A chiffon cake is a {{cross between}} an oil cake and a sponge cake. It {{includes}} baking powder and vegetable oil, but the eggs are separated and the whites are beaten before being folded into the batter creating the rich flavor like an oil cake, but with a lighter texture that's more like a sponge cake. They can be baked in <b>tube</b> <b>pans</b> or layered with fillings and frostings.|$|R
50|$|Angel food cakes {{are cooled}} upside down. Some <b>tube</b> <b>pans</b> have “feet” or “fingers” that extend {{off of the}} top rim of the pan. The “feet” are placed on a cooling rack. If the pan does not have “feet” it is {{customary}} for home bakers to place a glass soda bottle or something similar through the tube {{to ensure that the}} pan is elevated. The elevation provides sufficient air flow to the cake, so that it cools properly. If a non-stick pan or greased pan were used, the cake would fall out when inverted, leading to a collapsed cake.|$|R
50|$|The first {{method is}} the foam process or angel food cake method. The egg whites are whipped until a foam is formed before any other {{ingredients}} are added. This method {{ensures that the}} foam is not disturbed when it is being formed and that {{the maximum number of}} bubbles stay intact. Another method is called the meringue process. This entails whipping all or most of the ingredients together at the same time. This may result in a lower quality foam and a final cake with a reduced volume. The last method is call the continuous process and is usually used in commercial bakeries because it creates a consistent product in large volumes. Ingredients are fed into the continuous mixer in either one or two stages. A one-stage process mixes all of the ingredients together and feeds them into an emulsion head. Upon entry into the emulsion head, air is incorporated, fully mixing the batter. In a two-stage process, the ingredients are blended separately in different tanks according to the recipe. The speed of the mixer is controlled, as well as air flow to help mix the batter. The final batter may then go through a static mixer (a pipe with a spiral blade inside) to be deposited in a <b>tube</b> <b>pan,</b> depositor, or hopper.|$|E
40|$|Umbilical {{cord blood}} (UCB) {{represents}} {{a source for}} hematopoietic stem cells (CB-HSC), and transplantation of cord blood {{has been part of}} clinical practice since more than 10 years (Lee et al., Blood 103, 2004). The UCB is usually collected by public or private cord blood banks, which store it for an unknown recipient for an undetermined time. The cryopreservation process, used for stem cell collection, is particularly critical for umbilical cord blood (Berz et al., Am J Hematol 82, 2007). The most used cryoprotectant agent (CPA) to avoid or reduce cell damage caused by ice crystals, is 10 % dimethyl sulfoxide (Me 2 SO). Me 2 SO, while protecting the cells from membrane rupture, however has a toxic effect on them, depending on the temperature and the exposure time for both pre-freeze and post-thaw periods (Berz et al., Am J Hematol 82, 2007). Generation of oxygen-free radicals (ROS) is a major cause of cell damage during low-temperature storage (Katkova et al., Cryobiology 37 and Kearney, Burns 24, 1998). Cells counteract ROS accumulation through antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). The addition of antioxidants to the conventional freezing medium improves the post-thaw cell recovery (Limaye et al., Stem Cell Res. 10, 2001). The {{purpose of this study is}} the improvement of cord blood HSC’s (CB-HSC) cryopreservation method by addition of a new isoform of recombinant manganese superoxide dismutase (rMnSOD), obtained from the native liposarcoma derived form (LSA-MnSOD) (Mancini et al., Int. J. Cancer 119, 2006). rMnSOD, while having the same enzymatic activity common to all SODs, differs for its higher molecular weight (30 kDa versus 24 kDa) due to the presence of an additional sequence, called leader peptide, not cleaved during its maturation. As demonstrated by Mancini et al. (2006), recombinant LSA-type MnSOD (rMnSOD) has a distinctive capacity to penetrate cells and converts ROS to H 2 O 2. The latter is rapidly converted to O 2 and H 2 O by catalase, thus resulting in a beneficial oxygenation of healthy cells. In this study, we isolated mononuclear cells by lymphoprep gradient <b>tube</b> (<b>Pan</b> Biotech, Germany) from cord blood after informed consent of healthy donors, received by the Cord blood Bank Ba. S. C. O of “Santobono Pausilipon” hospital of Naples. HSCs CD 43 + were detected by flow cytometry and immunocytochemical methods at L. M., by using specific stem cell antibodies before and after the following experimental treatment. Cultured CB-HSCs were incubated with scalar concentrations from 1. 5 µM to 0. 015 µM of rMnSOD for 5 hours (with StemPro®- 34 SFM, Life Technologies) and frozen using standard freezing protocol with 10 % Me 2 SO. After thawing, CD 34 + viable cells were counted by flow cytometry FACSCalibur II (Becton & Dickinson) by using BD Stem Cell Enumeration Kit (BD Biosciences). The results showed that the viability of CB-HSC CD 34 + increased from 10 % of the control to 45 % by adding 0. 15 µM rMnSOD. Further experiments are progress to define the rMnSOD concentration able to obtain the greatest increase of post-thaw CB-HSC viability...|$|E

40|$|The {{existing}} {{small scale}} batch pans used {{for research in}} the South African sugar industry have limited capabilities for simulating industrial operations. In particular, these pans have been designed and used primarily for determining equilibrium conditions and have not been designed to achieve the rates of crystallization which are achieved in full scale pans. Operating an existing laboratory scale pan under closely controlled conditions also produced much wider crystal size distributions than are obtained in industrial scale pan boiling. To address these limitations and provide a facility to study crystallisation under closely controlled conditions which simulate industrial scale pan boiling, a new pilot scale batch pan has been designed and constructed. Features included {{in the design of}} the pan are, a steam heated calandria, the use of standard diameter <b>pan</b> <b>tubes</b> (100 mm), a variable speed mechanical stirrer and a high level of instrumentation and control. The design of the pan is described in terms of the experience gained on the small laboratory scale pan. Some performance data from the pan are presented...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of circulation and heat transfer in crystallisation vacuum pans that produce raw sugar in the sugar mill. The driving force for circulation and heat transfer occurs in the calandria <b>tubes</b> within vacuum <b>pans.</b> Numerical and CFD modelling is becoming a cost-effective and reliable way of developing vessel designs especially when there are complex physics and geometries involved, {{as is the case}} with vacuum pans. Currently, however, there are no working numerical models of vacuum pans that can be confidently used to design pans with improved circulation and boiling. If the operation of vacuum pans and specifically calandria tubes can be adequately modelled, the design of industrial vacuum pans can be improved to realise the benefits of obtaining more efficient circulation and heat transfer within the pan. The research aims to provide data on heat transfer and circulation in factory crystallisation vacuum pans and provide data on an experimental rig simulating a single calandria tube for validation of numerical models. Factory trials were conducted to obtain data on heat transfer and circulation in factory pans. A method for measuring circulation speeds in massecuite solutions and vacuum pans was refined as part of this research. The data collected from the factory trials enabled the operating conditions for the single calandria tube boiling rig experimental trials to be determined. The intention of the experimental rig was to simulate factory conditions to allow detailed examinations of the heat transfer process and vapour volume fraction profiles to be obtained. Natural and forced circulation conditions were investigated as both types of circulation are present in factory vacuum pans. The data gathered from these experiments were preliminary in nature as the rig did not adequately represent factory equipment. The research highlights problems associated with the boiling of viscous fluids, such as molasses on a laboratory scale. Strategies and recommendations are provided to enable a more adequate representation of factory conditions in the experimental rig. These improvements will allow more accurate data to be obtained that can be used to develop improved models of calandria <b>tubes</b> and vacuum <b>pans.</b> The experiments conducted on the single calandria tube detailed the physical changes and heat transfer characteristics for boiling in calandria tubes with changing material properties and heat input conditions. The experiments allowed fluid specific correlations to be obtained for heat transfer coefficients and vapour distribution during boiling in the calandria tubes. These correlations were used to develop numerical models of the boiling that occurs in calandria tubes. The numerical models provided a better understanding of the flow characteristics in the vessel and can facilitate the development of improved engineering designs. The project shows the applicability of a pilot scale rig to provide data that can be used to improve the understanding and modelling of flow and heat transfer in the calandria tubes of crystallisation vacuum pans...|$|R
40|$|The heat {{transfer}} and condensation of steam within the steam belt and the steam chest surrounding the calandria <b>tubes</b> of vacuum <b>pans</b> and evaporators were investigated using {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) modelling techniques. The flow of steam in evaporators and vacuum pans is an aspect that is not usually given much attention but it can influence the productivity of these vessels. The latent heat of the steam provides the heat to the juice or massecuite which induces the formation of vapour bubbles and drives the circulation of the fluid within the vessel. Strong and uniform circulation of the massecuite in vacuum pans increases the production capacity and improves {{the quality of the}} sugar produced. Non-uniform heating by the steam {{on the outside of the}} calandria tubes can contribute to uneven and inconsistent {{heat transfer}} to the juice or massecuite within the vessel. As a consequence under these circumstances the installed heating surface is not effectively utilised. Inconsistent heating can affect the performance of vacuum pans since it influences the circulation of massecuite and the crystallisation rate of sugar. The CFD modelling investigation into the steam side operation of the calandria of vacuum pans and evaporators was preliminary in nature but has shown promising results. The results of the CFD simulations were compared against measured data to determine the applicability of the CFD model. The condensation physics of the CFD model currently has limitations, yet despite these, the CFD model has identified some deficiencies in the flow of steam within the calandria. The investigations into different geometries for steam flow into evaporators and vacuum pans and the results of CFD simulations are detailed and discussed. Some of the proposed modifications resulted in predicted improvements to the distribution of steam within the calandria...|$|R
