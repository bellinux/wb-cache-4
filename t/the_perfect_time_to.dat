25|$|Law {{decided that}} the November party conference was <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{announce}} {{the withdrawal of the}} Referendum Pledge, and that Lord Lansdowne should do it, because he had been leader in the House of Lords when the pledge was made and because of his relatively low profile during the original tariff reform dispute. When the conference opened the British political world was febrile; on 12 November the opposition had narrowly defeated the government on an amendment to the Home Rule Bill, and the next evening, amidst hysterical shouting from the opposition, Asquith attempted to introduce a motion reversing the previous vote. As the MPs filed {{out at the end of}} the day Winston Churchill began taunting the opposition, and in his anger Ronald McNeil hurled a copy of Standing Orders of the House at Churchill, hitting him on the head. Law refused to condemn the events, and it seems apparent that while he had played no part in organising them they had been planned by the party Whips. As party leader, he was most likely aware of the plans even if he did not actively participate.|$|E

Polycythemia in neonates is a situation where the value of venous blood hematokrit over 65 % (0. 65) or the amount of hemoglobin more than 22 gr/Dl.

500|$|Co-writer Frank Spotnitz {{described}} the episode as a [...] "fortunate accident". Late {{in the fourth}} season of the show Gillian Anderson left the show for a week to film her part in the film The Mighty. The producers, knowing {{that they would have}} to write an episode without Dana Scully, decided it was not fair to have David Duchovny carry the same workload as in a normal episode considering her absence. As such, a story was devised in which his involvement would be light. This resulted in the decision to write, for the second year in a row, an episode focused on Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi). Howard Gordon, having written the previous Skinner-centric episode, [...] "Avatar", joined Spotnitz and the two wrote the episode over a weekend while another Gordon-written episode, [...] "Synchrony", was in production. The writers felt that this was <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> bring in Skinner's deal with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) to cure Scully's cancer, made in the episode [...] "Memento Mori". Frank Spotnitz said of Skinner's deal, [...] "The hard thing for Skinner was that we had to keep him in the middle. We had him tell Mulder not to bargain with The Smoking Man in order to save Scully's life. And then he himself struck a Faustian bargain with the Cigarette Smoking Man and was in his debt for some kind." ...|$|E

40|$|Fabrication of {{chitosan}} membrane and {{the effect}} of evaporation times on membrane performance in oily wastewater treatment are studied in this paper. Chitosan homogenous membranes were fabricated by casting a chitosan/acetic acid solution, and then evaporate it for different periods of time, followed by chemically cross-linking with sulfuric acid. The separation tests using the resulting membranes demonstrate that the chitosan membranes are capable of separating water–oil mixtures in wastewater. The optimized conditions for chemical cross-linking of membranes were found to be 0. 5 M of the cross-linking reagent (sulfuric acid) and 10 min reaction time at ambient temperature. The preparation time of chitosan membranes is the key factor to evaluate performance of separating water–oil. It was observed in orthogonal tests that the effect of membrane preparation time on the separation factor was significant. The highest separation factor was 1170 and it occurred at 120 minutes of evaporation time. The highest separation index also occurred at this period of time. The highest separation index was 1092609. These results suggested, 120 minutes is <b>the</b> most <b>perfect</b> evaporation <b>time</b> <b>to</b> produce an efficient chitosan membrane which can extract oil from waste water. As a conclusion, the present work clearly correlates the separation performance of wateroil by using the chitosan membrane resulting from the different of evaporation time...|$|R

On the Sunset Boulevard set in Broadway, the staircase steps had to be raised six inches (15cm) {{in order to accommodate}} Paige's short stature, or it would have been hard to see her behind the banister. [...] Paige was welcomed to the Broadway stage with a long standing ovation from the audience, and received largely positive reviews for her New York performance as Norma Desmond: [...] "The lush sound and the sheer power of her voice are, to put it simply, incredible", wrote one critic, whilst another said [...] "Her voice has great range, remarkable clarity and emotional force". Paige was the first Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard to sing one of the show's key songs, [...] "With One Look", which she did first at Lloyd Webber's wedding to Madeleine Gurdon, although at the time the song was called [...] "Just One Glance". Lloyd Webber noted, regarding Paige's performance of one of the show's other prominent songs, [...] "As If We Never Said Goodbye", that it was [...] "as good, if not the best, of anything I've ever heard of mine". [...] Regarding the key lyric in the song, [...] "This world's waited long enough.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse a {{computer}} system considering the aspects of redundancy, priority in repair disciplines and arrival time of the server. Two identical units of a computer system are taken up in which one unit is initially operative and the other is kept as spare in cold standby. In each unit h/w and s/w work together and fail independently from normal mode. There is a single server who takes some <b>time</b> <b>to</b> arrive at the system for doing repair and replacement of the components. Server repairs the unit at its h/w failure while replacement of the s/w is made by new one giving some replacement time in case s/w fails to execute the programmes properly. Priority to the h/w repair is given over the s/w replacement. All random variables are uncorrelated to each other. Repair and switch devices are <b>perfect.</b> <b>The</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> failure of the unit due to h/w and s/w is exponentially distributed while the distributions of repair, replacement and arrival times of the server are taken as arbitrary with different probability density functions (pdf). Some reliability characteristics of the system model are derived in steady state using semi-Markov process and regenerative point technique. The numerical results for MTSF, availability and profit are obtained considering a particular case to know their behaviour with respect to different parameters...|$|R
