Air breaks are taken between oxygen breathing {{to reduce the risk}} of oxygen toxicity.|$|E

25|$|Treatment of DCS {{utilizing}} the US Navy Treatment <b>Table</b> <b>6</b> with oxygen at 18m {{is a standard}} of care. Significant delay to treatment, difficult transport, and facilities with limited experience may lead one to consider on site treatment. Surface oxygen for first aid has been proven to improve the efficacy of recompression and decreased the number of recompression treatments required when administered within four hours post dive. IWR to 9 m breathing oxygen is one option that has shown success over the years IWR is not without risk and should be undertaken with certain precautions. IWR would only be suitable for an organised and disciplined group of divers with suitable equipment and practical training in the procedure.|$|E

500|$|The {{presence}} of a fever or a history of seizure is a relative contraindication to hyperbaric oxygen treatment. The schedules used for treatment of decompression illness allow for periods of breathing air rather than 100% oxygen (oxygen breaks) to reduce the chance of seizure or lung damage. The U.S. Navy uses treatment tables based on periods alternating between 100% oxygen and air. For example, USN <b>table</b> <b>6</b> requires 75minutes (three periods of 20minutes oxygen/5minutes air) at an ambient pressure of , equivalent {{to a depth of}} [...] This is followed by a slow reduction in pressure to [...] over 30minutes on oxygen.
