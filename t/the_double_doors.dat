The cottages have timber floors and wide timber verandahs, enclosed with pivoting storm screens.

Originally, a breezeway divided the houses into two sections, one comprising three rooms and one comprising two larger rooms, with a corridor between them leading to <b>the</b> <b>double</b> <b>doors</b> to the verandah. The building has been altered, and the original breezeway has been converted to a living area.|$|E
25|$|Master {{craftsman}} Elias Concepcion {{has been}} credited with {{the execution of the}} interior finishes. His handling of the ornamental elements ranges from the curvilinear and stylized floral motifs present in the stained glass of <b>the</b> <b>double</b> <b>doors,</b> to the rectilinear wood screen—reminiscent of the arts and craft movement– dividing the foyer from the living room. As with the exterior, the interior is a mixture of distinct stylistic elements. The vestibule's repousse sheet metal ornamentation reflects the roccoco treatment of the exterior, at once maintaining an image of opulence and refinement for the visitor while creating a transitional device for the predominantly planar interior surfaces. Many highstyle interiors of the beginning of the 20th century in the Ponce and Yauco region have been attributed to Elias Concepcion due to his sophisticated integration and subtle resolution of an eclectic vocabulary.|$|E
