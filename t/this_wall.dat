5|$|Another, short {{wall was}} added in later times, {{probably}} in the reign of Theophilos, stretching from the junction {{of the land and}} sea walls to the sea itself, and pierced by the so-called Wooden Gate (Ξυλίνη πύλη, Xylinē pylē, or Ξυλόπορτα, Xyloporta). Both <b>this</b> <b>wall</b> and the gate were demolished in 1868.|$|E
5|$|To {{the south}} of <b>this</b> <b>wall</b> is the {{remaining}} wall of the keep. The mound beneath is formed from the collapsed remnants {{of the other three}} walls. The ruin suggests that the keep was around 16m by 12m, with walls 2.9m thick rising to a machicolated parapet.|$|E
5|$|According to tradition, {{the city}} was founded as Byzantium by Greek colonists from Megara, led by the eponymous Byzas, around 658 BC. At the time the city {{consisted}} of a small region around an acropolis, located on the easternmost hill (corresponding to the modern site of the Topkapı Palace). According to the late Byzantine Patria of Constantinople, ancient Byzantium was enclosed by a small wall, which began on {{the northern edge of}} the acropolis, extended west to the Tower of Eugenios, then went south and west towards the Strategion and the Baths of Achilles, continued south to the area known in Byzantine times as Chalkoprateia, and then turned, {{in the area of the}} Hagia Sophia, in a loop towards the northeast, crossed the regions known as Topoi and Arcadianae and reached the sea at the later quarter of Mangana. <b>This</b> <b>wall</b> was protected by 27 towers, and had at least two landward gates, one which survived to become known as the Arch of Urbicius, and one where the Milion monument was later located. On the seaward side, the wall was much lower. Although the author of the Patria asserts that <b>this</b> <b>wall</b> dated to the time of Byzas, the French researcher Raymond Janin thinks it more likely that it reflects the situation after {{the city was}} rebuilt by the Spartan general Pausanias, who conquered the city in 479 BC. <b>This</b> <b>wall</b> is known to have been repaired, utilising tomb stones, under the leadership of a certain Leo in 340 BC, against an attack by Philip II of Macedon.|$|E

5|$|The wall {{surrounding}} the temple was formerly {{part of a}} city wall that surrounded Quyang. The south gate of the temple once served {{as one of the}} main gates for the town.

5|$|It is in {{this period}} that the broch was built. Part of the {{structure}} has been lost to coastal erosion, and modern sea defences have been erected. The tower was probably originally 13metres (40feet) or more high and as with many broch sites the position would have commanded fine views of the surrounding seas. During this period archaeological sites in Shetland usually exhibit defensive fortifications of some kind, and Jarlshof is no exception. An outer defensive wall associated with the broch contained a substantial (although rather poorly constructed) house and byre at one time. <b>This</b> <b>wall</b> was utilised at a later stage to build a large roundhouse {{in the lee of}} the broch.|$|E
5|$|The first {{church was}} {{markedly}} cruciform {{in shape and}} smaller than the present floor plan. This early structure had a choir without aisles and more truncated, and a nave with only a single aisle on its north and south sides (Fig. 4). The central tower rose above the crossing {{between the north and}} south transepts and may have held bells in its upper storey. The north wall of the choir is the earliest extant structure, dating to the years immediately after the church's 1224 foundation; the clerestory windows on top of it are from the later post-1270 reconstruction. <b>This</b> <b>wall</b> has blocked up windows extending to a low level above ground, indicating that it was an external wall and proving that the eastern limb then had no aisle (Fig. 5).|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>wall</b> (Muralla is the {{protective}} perimeter wall) is emphasized, by its dimensions (four metres high by three metres thick) {{as well as}} by its location on edges of the cliffs surrounding the north and northeast parts of the site.
