25|$|An {{entangled}} {{system is}} defined {{to be one}} whose quantum state cannot be factored {{as a product of}} states of its local constituents; that is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not individual particles but are an inseparable whole. In entanglement, one constituent cannot be fully described without considering the other(s). Note that the state of a composite system is always expressible as a sum, or superposition, of products of states of local constituents; it is entangled if this sum necessarily has more than one term.|$|E
25|$|Many critics hold postmodern art {{emerges from}} modern art. Suggested dates for {{the shift from}} modern to postmodern include 1914 in Europe, and 1962 or 1968 in America. James Elkins, commenting on discussions about the exact date of the {{transition}} from modernism to postmodernism, compares it to the discussion in the 1960s about the exact span of Mannerism and whether it should begin directly after the High Renaissance or later in the century. He makes the point these debates go {{on all the time}} with respect to art movements and periods, which is not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not important. The close of the period of postmodern art has been dated {{to the end of the}} 1980s, when the word postmodernism lost much of its critical resonance, and art practices began to address the impact of globalization and new media.|$|E
25|$|Others, {{especially}} Isaac Hirsch Weiss, {{object that}} many tosafot— {{particularly those of}} Isaiah di Trani— have no reference to Rashi. Weiss, followed by other scholars, asserts that tosafot means additions to the Talmud, that is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> an extension {{and development of the}} Talmud. For just as the Gemara is a critical and analytical commentary on the Mishnah, so are the Tosafot critical and analytical glosses on those two parts of the Talmud. Further, the term tosafot was not applied {{for the first time to}} the glosses of Rashi's continuators, but to the Tosefta, the additions to the Mishnah compiled by Judah ha-Nasi I. Tosefta is a Babylonian term, which in Jerusalem writings is replaced by tosafot. The Tosafot resemble the Gemara in other respects also, for just as the latter is the work of different schools carried on through a long period, so the former were written at different times and by different schools, and gathered later into one body.|$|E

500|$|In {{evaluating}} {{the impact of}} the public's reaction to Parker's alleged 1999 rape of a fellow Penn State student, a film producer told The Hollywood Reporter, about Parker's directing career, [...] "His inability to act like he cared that people invested a whole lot of money in him — sorry. You go into the 'life is too short' category." [...] Noting that {{the first half of the}} New York Times review of The Birth of a Nation is taken up with the controversy, this person adds, [...] "No matter what Nate Parker makes, ... this will always be the first paragraph." [...] Other industry insiders note that, [...] "unlike Gibson — or Roman Polanski or Woody Allen, both accused of sexual assault (Polanski pled guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse) — Parker is just beginning his directing career and has not built up an acclaimed body of work that might encourage some <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> willing to separate the artist from the art." ...|$|E
2500|$|Categorical {{perception}} {{is involved in}} processes of perceptual differentiation. People perceive speech sounds categorically, that is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> more likely to notice the differences between categories (phonemes) than within categories. The perceptual space between categories is therefore warped, the centers of categories (or [...] "prototypes") working like a sieve or like magnets for incoming speech sounds.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter {{seventeen}} {{addresses the}} most common counter-argument that Hitchens says he hears, namely that the most immoral acts in human history were performed by atheists like Joseph Stalin. He says [...] "it is interesting that people of faith now seek defensively <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> no worse than fascists or Nazis or Stalinists". He analyzes those examples of immorality, and shows that although the individual leaders may have been atheist or agnostic, that religion {{played a key role}} in these events, and religious people and religious leaders fully participated in the wars and crimes.|$|E

Anthony also proclaimed,"The only question left to be settled now is: Are women persons? And I hardly believe any of our opponents will have the hardihood <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not. Being persons, then, women are citizens; and no state has a right to make any law, or to enforce any old law, that shall abridge their privileges or immunities." ...|$|E
2500|$|The basic {{definitions}} and facts above enable {{one to do}} classical algebraic geometry. To {{be able to do}} more [...] for example, to deal with varieties over fields that are not algebraically closed [...] some foundational changes are required. The modern notion of a variety is considerably more abstract than the one above, though equivalent in the case of varieties over algebraically closed fields. An abstract algebraic variety is a particular kind of scheme; the generalization to schemes on the geometric side enables an extension of the correspondence described above to a wider class of rings. A scheme is a locally ringed space such that every point has a neighbourhood that, as a locally ringed space, is isomorphic to a spectrum of a ring. Basically, a variety over [...] is a scheme whose structure sheaf is a sheaf of -algebras with the property that the rings R that occur above are all integral domains and are all finitely generated -algebras, that is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> quotients of polynomial algebras by prime ideals.|$|E

2500|$|From 1977 to 1981, Jon [...] "Bowzer" [...] Bauman hosted {{other musicians}} on his {{television}} show Sha Na Na. He talked with Carl Gardner of the Coasters and Charlie Thomas of the Drifters, discovering {{in the process}} {{that they were being}} victimized by [...] "knock-off" [...] groups of performers using the name of a famous group without having a member of that group. Ben E. King said he, Thomas and Bill Pinkney were losing out on potential gigs and income because there were [...] "so many fake Drifters performing". Herb Reed of the Platters told Bauman that his group had experienced [...] "about 30" [...] court cases fighting against fake groups. Researching the laws, Bauman found that the original musicians had scant legal protection against their group name being used by promoters or other performers, so he determined to amend the existing laws to increase protection for the original musicians. He allied with the Vocal Group Hall of Fame (VGHF) to bring famous musicians together to help promote these new laws. VGHF President Bob Crosby said of the fake groups [...] "It's a form of identity theft to the artists... Most importantly it is misleading the public for them to think they are seeing the artist who made the hits when they are not." [...] Mary Wilson of the Supremes joined the effort, appearing with Bauman before the US Congress in March 1999. She said [...] "We want these fake groups <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> tribute groups or get their own name." ...|$|E

5000|$|James went on {{to apply}} the pragmatic method to the {{epistemological}} problem of truth. He would seek the meaning of 'true' by examining how the idea functioned in our lives. A belief was true, he said, if it worked for all of us, and guided us expeditiously through our semihospitable world. James was anxious to uncover what true beliefs amounted to in human life, what their [...] "cash value" [...] was, and what consequences they led to. A belief was not a mental entity which somehow mysteriously corresponded to an external reality if the belief were true. Beliefs were ways of acting with reference to a precarious environment, and <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> true <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> efficacious in this environment. In this sense the pragmatic theory of truth applied Darwinian ideas in philosophy; it made survival the test of intellectual as well as biological fitness.|$|R
