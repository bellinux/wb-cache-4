A systematic review concluded no data exists to definitively link metformin to lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{defends the}} chosen nest site against other peregrines, and often against ravens, herons, and gulls, and if ground-nesting, also such mammals as foxes, wolverines, felids, bears, wolves, and {{mountain}} lions. Both nests and (less frequently) adults are predated by larger-bodied raptorial birds like eagles, large owls, or gyrfalcons. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> predators of peregrine nests in North America and Europe are the {{great horned owl}} and the Eurasian eagle owl. When reintroductions have been attempted for peregrines, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> impediments were these two owls routinely picking off nestlings, fledglings and adults by night. Peregrines defending their nests have managed to kill raptors as large as golden eagles and bald eagles (both of which they normally avoid as potential predators) that have come {{too close to the}} nest by ambushing them in a full stoop. In one instance, when a snowy owl killed a newly fledged peregrine, the larger owl was in turn killed by a stooping peregrine parent.|$|E

At least twenty four vessels are known to have been wrecked in the area. <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> being the Dove in 1828 with the loss of seven lives, and the Pandora in 1836 with five lives.
