40|$|Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) Radar has {{traditionally}} been used in short range applications. Conventional FMCW radar {{requires the use of}} expensive microwave mixers and low noise amplifiers. A uniquely inexpensive solution was created, using inexpensive Gunn oscillator based microwave <b>transceiver</b> <b>modules</b> that consist of 3 diodes inside of a resonant cavity. However these <b>transceiver</b> <b>modules</b> have stability problems which cause them to be unsuitable for use in precise FMCW radar applications, when just one module is used.

40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging is an {{expensive}} endeavor. It can be difficult for universities, small business, or individuals to experiment with SAR imaging and algorithm development on a low budget. For this reason, a uniquely inexpensive solution to Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar was developed and then utilized as an ultra low cost SAR imaging system. This unique approach to FMCW radar uses a pair of low cost Gunn oscillator based microwave <b>transceiver</b> <b>modules</b> known as ‘Gunnplexers’. These <b>transceiver</b> <b>modules</b> have stability and noise problems causing them to be unsuitable for use in precise FMCW radar applications when just one module is used.

This FMCW radar system was then used in a small Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging system. The SAR imaging system was composed of a 12 foot long linear track to which the FMCW radar system was mounted. The FMCW radar system would traverse the linear track, acquiring data {{to be used for}} producing SAR imagery. The combination of the small aperture length, narrow bandwidth transmit chirp, and overall frequency instability of the FMCW radar system created a number of SAR imaging problems which were unique in this application. However, it was found that when these issues were properly addressed it was possible to create SAR imagery on a low budget...|$|R
