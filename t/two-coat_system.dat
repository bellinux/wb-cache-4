40|$|An {{ethylcellulose}} lacquer {{system for}} both decorative and protective purposes {{was developed for}} use on polystyrene plastics. It was found that a one-coat lacquer containing only alcohol solvents produced the most satisfactory finish. Formulations were based on experimental work, conducted {{to determine the effect}} of the various lacquer components on the plastic. The results of a study of formulations on a <b>two-coat</b> <b>system</b> are presented...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{lower the cost of}} {{coatings}} on new steel bridges, reducing the number of the coats required on the beam has been proposed. A recently-published study (Yao et al. 2011) evaluated the performance of eight different one-coat systems and compared it to one three-coat system and one <b>two-coat</b> <b>system.</b> The results showed that although the one-coat systems demonstrated promising performance, they did not perform as well as the three-coat systems under accelerated laboratory and outdoor exposures.|$|E
40|$|The {{current state}} of art for {{corrosion}} protection of steel bridges involves a three-coat system typically consisting of a zinc-rich primer, an intermediate coat, and a top coat. Replacing a threecoat system with fewer coats without sacrificing corrosion resistance can lead to savings in production cost and improved productivity in the steel shops. Two-coat systems evaluated in a previous Federal Highway Administration study performed on par with the widely established well-performing zinc-rich three-coat systems. In this in-house one-coat study, commercially available coating materials {{that can be applied}} as one-coat systems to new steel bridges were evaluated. Eight one-coat systems and two controls, a three-coat and a <b>two-coat</b> <b>system,</b> were chosen, and their performance was evaluated using accelerated laboratory testing (ALT) and two outdoor exposure conditions, natural weathering (NW) and natural weathering with salt spray (NWS). ALT (6, 840 h) and the two outdoor exposure conditions (NW and NWS), both 18 months, were performed at the Coatings and Corrosion Laboratory at the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center in McLean, VA, while another outdoor exposure was performed at a marine exposure site for 24 months in Sea Isle City, NJ. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the performance ranking of various one-coat test systems...|$|E
50|$|Epoxy {{moisture}} control systems are roller-applied {{and are available}} in one-coat and <b>two-coat</b> varieties. One-coat <b>systems</b> allow for a faster installation time, while <b>two-coat</b> <b>systems</b> address the potential for pinholes or voids in the system, which can cause future failures. Epoxy {{moisture control}} systems can be applied over concrete with relative humidity levels up to 100%, and there are systems available {{on the market today}} that can be applied over concrete that is physically damp. In some cases, with the use of an epoxy moisture control system, floor coverings can be installed just 7 days after the slab is poured.|$|R
