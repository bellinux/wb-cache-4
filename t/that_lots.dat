She stated, [...] "I did the vocal gymnastics thing because it was fun. That's why I like blues, too, because you can experiment more with that side of your voice.

[...] Hillenburg responded about the character's sexual orientation and stated that he is [...] " [...] cheerful character [...] is not gay." [...] He clarified that he considers the character to be [...] "almost asexual". The show's popularity among gay men would become controversial. In 2005, a promotional video, which showed SpongeBob along with other characters from children's shows singing together to promote diversity and tolerance, was attacked by an evangelical group in the United States because they saw SpongeBob being used as an [...] "advocate for homosexuality". James Dobson of Focus on the Family accused the makers of the video of [...] "promoting homosexuality due to a pro-tolerance group sponsoring the video". After Dobson made the comments, Hillenburg repeated this assertion that sexual preference was never considered during the creation of the show. Tom Kenny and other production members were shocked and surprised that such an issue had arisen. Dobson later asserted that his comments were taken out of context and that his original complaints were not with SpongeBob, the video, or any of the characters in the video but with the organization that sponsored the video, We Are Family Foundation. Dobson indicated that the We Are Family Foundation posted pro-homosexual material on their website, but later removed it.|$|E
