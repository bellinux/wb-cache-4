50|$|Most torque {{vectoring}} differentials are on all-wheel drive vehicles. A basic <b>torque</b> <b>vectoring</b> <b>differential</b> varies torque between {{the front and}} rear wheels. This means that, under normal driving conditions, the front wheels receive a set percentage of the engine torque, and the rear wheels receive the rest. If needed, the differential can transfer more torque between {{the front and rear}} wheels to improve vehicle performance.|$|E
5000|$|Torque {{vectoring}} is {{a technology}} employed in automobile differentials. A differential transfers engine torque to the wheels. Torque vectoring technology provides the differential {{with the ability}} to vary the torque to each wheel. This method of power transfer has recently become popular in all-wheel drive vehicles. [...] Some newer front-wheel drive vehicles also have a basic <b>torque</b> <b>vectoring</b> <b>differential.</b> As technology in the automotive industry improves, more vehicles are equipped with torque vectoring differentials. This allows for the wheels to grip the road for better launch and handling.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are more}} {{advanced}} <b>torque</b> <b>vectoring</b> <b>differentials</b> as well. These differentials build on basic torque transfer between {{front and rear}} wheels. They add the capability to transfer torque between individual wheels. This provides an even more effective method of improving handling characteristics. The differential monitors each wheel independently, and distributes available torque to match current conditions. Acura’s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) can transfer power between front and rear and vary the amount of torque transmitted to each rear wheel. The front wheels, however, do not receive different amounts of torque. [...] Audi produced a <b>torque</b> <b>vectoring</b> system capable of varying the torque received by any wheel of the vehicle: quattro with <b>torque</b> <b>vectoring.</b> This allows each wheel to receive independent torque amounts to increase the overall performance of the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Mechanically, {{this model}} is fitted with a <b>torque</b> <b>vectoring</b> rear <b>differential,</b> able to send 100% of the torque {{to the left or}} right wheel, and, on the model which debuted in July 2015, a {{six-speed}} manual transmission, made by ZF. The braking system uses carbon ceramic rotors, six-pot front and four-pot rear calipers, and auxiliary rear calipers for the parking brake. The electronic stability control and the traditional brake servo are combined in a single electromechanical system.|$|R
50|$|The <b>torque</b> <b>vectoring</b> {{rear axle}} <b>differential</b> is {{designed}} and manufactured by Magna Powertrain, {{and is being}} offered on Audi A4, A5, A6 and their derivatives (including RS models). The Sport Differential selectively distributes torque to the rear axle wheels thereby generating a yaw moment, which improves handling and also stabilizes the vehicle when it oversteers or understeers, thereby increasing safety.|$|R
5000|$|The phrase [...] "Torque Vectoring" [...] {{was first}} used by Ricardo in 2006 SAE 2006-01-0818 in {{relation}} to their driveline technologies. The torque vectoring idea builds on the basic principles of a standard differential. A <b>torque</b> <b>vectoring</b> <b>differential</b> performs basic differential tasks while also transmitting torque independently between wheels. This torque transferring ability improves handling and traction in almost any situation. Torque vectoring differentials were originally used in racing. Mitsubishi rally cars were some of the earliest to use the technology. [...] The technology has slowly developed and is now being implemented in a small variety of production vehicles. The most common use of torque vectoring in automobiles today is in all-wheel drive vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Torque {{vectoring}} differentials on {{front or}} {{rear wheel drive}} vehicles are less complex, yet share {{many of the same}} benefits as all-wheel drive differentials. The differential only varies torque between two wheels. The electronic monitoring system only monitors two wheels, making it less complex. A front-wheel drive differential must take into account several factors. It must monitor rotational and steering angle of the wheels. As these factors vary during driving, different forces are exerted on the wheels. The differential monitors these forces, and adjusts torque accordingly. Many front-wheel drive differentials can increase or decrease torque transmitted to a certain wheel. This ability improves a vehicle’s capability to maintain traction in poor weather conditions. When one wheel begins to slip, the differential can reduce the torque to that wheel, effectively braking the wheel. The differential also increases torque to the opposite wheel, helping balance the power output and keep the vehicle stable. A rear-wheel drive <b>torque</b> <b>vectoring</b> <b>differential</b> works the same way as a front-wheel drive differential.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea and}} {{implementation}} of torque vectoring are both complex. The main goal of torque vectoring is to independently vary torque to each wheel. Differentials generally consist of only mechanical components. A <b>torque</b> <b>vectoring</b> <b>differential</b> requires an electronic monitoring system in addition to standard mechanical components. This electronic system tells the differential {{when and how to}} vary the torque. Due to the number of wheels that receive power, a front or rear wheel drive differential is less complex than an all-wheel drive differential.The impact of torque distribution is the generation of yaw moment arising from longitudinal forces and changes to the lateral resistance generated by each tyre. Applying more longitudinal force reduces the lateral resistance that can be generated. The specific driving condition dictates what the trade-off should be to either damp or excite yaw acceleration. The function is independent of technology and could be achieved by driveline devices for a conventional powertrain, or with electrical torque sources.Then comes the practical element of integration with brake stability functions for both fun and safety.|$|E

TVD is a technology that is able to distribute the engine torque to the left and right driving wheels at different ratios so that the yaw motion control can be realized.

In this study, a new TVD design with a Ravigneaux gearset was developed. This new design is able to use only one pair of gearsets to generate two different speed ratios, and the weight and volume of the system can be reduced. To execute the research, current TVD designs were analyzed and their design principles were clarified. Next, a new TVD design with Ravigneaux gearset was proposed. Then the connecting manner and the gear ratio of the Ravigneaux gearset were discussed. The dynamic equation of the system was then derived and the operation of the system was simulated in a MATLAB program. Further simulation was performed with a vehicle dynamic model in SimulationX to demonstrate the effect of the new system.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis describes an investigation into vehicle handling control using active differentials in the rear axle of a motor vehicle. Such devices are able to transfer torque between the rear wheels and have traditionally been used to improve traction whilst minimising the impact on vehicle handling. However, the capacity to generate a lateral torque difference across an axle also gives them {{the potential to be}} used for yaw moment control. In order to generate a rigorous assessment of this potential, the investigation is carried out in three distinct phases. Firstly, an analysis of the scope for modifying vehicle handling given unrestricted control over torque transfer between the rear wheels is carded out in the simulation environment. For this purpose an idealised yaw sideslip controller is developed. This is used to show that an ideal active differential can have significant yaw moment authority in terms of generating both understeer and oversteer and that this can be used to actively modify a vehicle's handling balance and apply stability control at the limits of adhesion. In the second phase, the capabilities of two types of contemporary active differential, the <b>torque</b> <b>vectoring</b> <b>differential</b> (TVD) and active limited slip differential (ALSID), are then assessed against the ideal differential and against a brake based yaw moment controller. TVDs are found to be able to offer very similar performance to both their ideal counterpart and to the brake based system. They Gan also deliver this performance with a fraction of the energy loss that is observed in the brakes, thus making TVDs a viable proposition for applying continuous yaw control below the limits of adhesion. ALSDs, on the other hand do not offer equivalent functionality to an ideal active differential but are still shown to be very effective stability control devices. In the third phase, the ALSID results are validated on a prototype vehicle where it is shown that they do indeed offer substantial stability improvements both on high and low-P surfaces. However in order to deliver such benefits and be practical for implementation, it is also shown that significant redevelopment of the idealised controller is required.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for active safety systems to assist drivers in {{unfavorable}} driving conditions. In these conditions, {{the behavior of the}} vehicle is different than the linear response during everyday driving. Even experienced drivers usually lose control of the vehicle in such situations and that often results in a car accident. Stability control systems have been developed {{over the past few decades}} to assist drivers in keeping the vehicle under control. Most of these control systems are comprised of separate modules, each responsible for one task such as yaw rate tracking, sideslip control, traction control or power distribution. These objectives may be in conflict in some driving situations. In such cases, individual controllers fight over priority and produce conflicting control commands, to the detriment of the vehicle performance. In addition, in most stability control systems, transferring the controller from one vehicle to another with a different driveline and actuator configuration requires significant modifications in the controller and major re-tuning to obtain a similar performance. This is a major disadvantage for auto companies and increases the controller design and tuning costs. In this thesis, an integrated control system has been designed to address vehicle stability, traction control and power distribution objectives at the same time. The proposed controller casts all of these objectives in a single objective function and chooses control actions to optimize this objective function. Therefore, the output of the integrated controller is not altered by another module and the optimality of the solution is not compromised. Furthermore, the designed controller can be easily reconfigured to work with various driveline configurations such as all-wheel drive, front or rear-wheel drive. In addition, it can also work with various actuator configurations such as <b>torque</b> <b>vectoring,</b> <b>differential</b> braking or any combination of them on the front or rear axles. Moving from one configuration to another does not change the stability control performance and major re-tuning can be avoided. The performance of the designed model predictive controller is evaluated in software simulations with a high fidelity model of an electric Equinox vehicle. The stability and wheel slip control performance of the controller is evaluated in various driving and road conditions. In addition, the effect of integrated power distribution is studied. Experimental tests with two different electric vehicles are also carried out to evaluate the real-time performance of the MPC controller. It is observed that the controller is able to maintain vehicle and wheel stability in all of the driving scenarios considered. The power distribution system is able to improve vehicle efficiency by approximately 1. 5 % and acts in cooperation with the stability control objectives...|$|E
40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for the development of}} vehicle stability control systems {{comes from the fact that}} vehicle dynamic behavior in unfavorable driving conditions such as low road-tire adhesion and high speed differs greatly from its nominal behavior. Due to this unexpected behavior, a driver may not be successful in controlling the vehicle in challenging driving situations based only on her/his everyday driving experience. Several noteworthy research works have been conducted on stability control systems over the last two decades to prevent car accidents due to human error. Most of the resultant stability controllers contain individual modules, where each perform a particular task such as yaw tracking, sideslip control, or wheel slip control. These design requirements may contradict each other in some driving scenarios. In such situations, inconsistent control actions can be generated with individual modules. The development of a stability controller that can satisfy diverse and often contradictory requirements is a great challenge. In general, transferring a control structure from one vehicle to another with a different drivetrain layout and actuation system configuration requires remarkable rectifications and repetition of tuning processes from the beginning to achieve a similar performance. This can be considered to be a serious drawback for car manufacturing companies since it results in extra effort, time, and expenses in redesigning and retuning the controller. In this thesis, an integrated controller with a modular structure has been designed to concurrently provide control of the vehicle chassis (yaw rate and sideslip control) and wheel stability (wheel slip ratio control). The proposed control structure incorporates longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics to decide on a unified control action. This control action is an outcome of solving an optimization problem that considers all the control objectives in a single cost function, so integrated wheel and vehicle stability is guaranteed. Moreover, according to the particular modular design of the proposed control structure, it can be easily reconfigured to work with different drivetrain layouts such as all-wheel-drive, front-wheel-drive, and rear-wheel-drive, as well as various actuators such as <b>torque</b> <b>vectoring,</b> <b>differential</b> braking, and active steering systems. The high-level control module provides a Center of Gravity (CG) based error analysis and determines the required longitudinal forces and yaw moment adjustments. The low-level control module utilizes this information to allocate control actions optimally at each vehicle corner (wheel) through a single or multi-actuator regime. In order to consider the effect of the actuator dynamics, a mathematical description of the auction system is included in distribution objective function. Therefore, a legitimate control performance is promised in situations requiring shifting from one configuration to another with minimal modifications. The performance of the proposed modular control structure is examined in simulations with a high-fidelity model of an electric GM Equinox vehicle. The high-fidelity model has been developed and provided by GM and the use of the model is to reduce the number of labor-intensive vehicle test and is to test extreme and dangerous driving conditions. Several driving scenarios with severe steering and throttle commands, then, are designed to evaluate the capability of the proposed control structure in integrated longitudinal and lateral vehicle stabilization on slippery road condition. Experimental tests also have been performed with two different electric vehicles for real-time implementation as well as validation purposes. The observations verified the performance qualifications of the proposed control structure to preserve integrated wheel and vehicle chassis stability in all track tests...|$|E

In particular, energy consumption reductions can be obtained through specific design of the wheel torque control allocation algorithm and the reference yaw rate characteristics. Experiments with a four-wheel-drive electric vehicle demonstrate considerable energy savings...|$|R
