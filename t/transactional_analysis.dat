25|$|In the UK and Europe, {{the years}} 1987 to 1989 {{were marked by}} a {{large-scale}} revival of many characteristics of the hippie movement. This later movement, composed mostly of people aged 18 to 25, adopted much of the original hippie philosophy of love, peace and freedom. The summer of 1988 {{became known as the}} Second Summer of Love. Although the music favored by this movement was modern electronic music, especially house music and acid house, one could often hear songs from the original hippie era in the chill out rooms at raves. In the UK, many of the well-known figures of this movement first lived communally in Stroud Green, an area of north London located in Finsbury Park. In 1995, The Sekhmet Hypothesis attempted to link both hippie and rave culture together in relation to <b>transactional</b> <b>analysis,</b> suggesting that rave culture was a social archetype based on the mood of friendly strength, compared to the gentle hippie archetype, based on friendly weakness. The later electronic dance genres known as goa trance and psychedelic trance and its related events and culture have important hippie legacies and neo hippie elements. The popular DJ of the genre Goa Gil, like other hippies from the 1960s, decided to leave the US and Western Europe to travel on the hippie trail and later developing psychedelic parties and music in the Indian island of Goa in which the goa and psytrance genres were born and exported around the world in the 1990s and 2000s.|$|E

Such representation makes sense as the financial risk may be determined at a point of time in future where nothing is certain. Depending upon the complexity of the problem, we explain the different ways of using the convolution operator to determine the financial risk.

40|$|The overall {{ambition}} {{with this}} thesis {{is to develop}} knowledge about students’ learning, {{especially with regard to}} process and content, when they participate in argumentation. Students’ learning is investigated through in situ studies of classroom practices. The theoretical point of departure is a pragmatic perspective in which learning is understood and investigated in terms of concrete actions. The empirical material consists of video recorded lessons at secondary and upper secondary schools in Sweden. The content of the lessons is argumentative discussions about sustainable development and socioscientific issues. In the first study, the functions that teachers’ actions have for students’ learning processes are investigated using Epistemological Move Analysis. In the second study, an approach is developed and illustrated that facilitates investigations into students’ learning processes in terms of knowledge content and argument construction in argumentation. The method, called <b>Transactional</b> Argumentation <b>Analysis,</b> combines a pragmatic perspective of learning with an argument analysis based on Toulmin’s Argument Pattern. In the third study, the functions that knowledge have when used by students in argumentative discussions are examined. The fourth study investigates the role of peers for students’ learning and how students influence the argumentation at a collective level. Here <b>Transactional</b> Argumentation <b>Analysis</b> is developed further in order to facilitate investigations of the dynamic interplay between the intra-personal and the inter-personal dimensions of learning and the result of this interplay in terms of the knowledge content and arguments that are constructed. The thesis shows how students’ learning can be investigated through in situ studies of educational practices. The methodological contribution of the thesis consists of the development and further elaboration of <b>Transactional</b> Argumentation <b>Analysis.</b> The thesis also contributes with substantial knowledge about students’ learning processes with regard to knowledge content and argument construction when participating in argumentation. Another contribution concerns the functions of knowledge when used by students in argumentation. Finally, the studies show how peers and teachers influence students’ learning, and how students contribute to the shared argumentation in the classroom. ...|$|R

2500|$|Some {{therapeutic}} approaches developed {{out of the}} European {{school of}} existential philosophy. Concerned mainly with the individual's ability to develop and preserve a sense of meaning and purpose throughout life, major contributors to the field (e.g., Irvin Yalom, Rollo May) and Europe (Viktor Frankl, Ludwig Binswanger, Medard Boss, R.D.Laing, Emmy van Deurzen) attempted to create therapies sensitive to common [...] "life crises" [...] springing from the essential bleakness of human self-awareness, previously accessible only through the complex writings of existential philosophers (e.g., Søren Kierkegaard, Jean-Paul Sartre, Gabriel Marcel, Martin Heidegger, Friedrich Nietzsche). The uniqueness of the patient-therapist relationship thus also forms a vehicle for therapeutic inquiry. A related body of thought in psychotherapy started in the 1950s with Carl Rogers. Based also on the works of Abraham Maslow and his hierarchy of human needs, Rogers brought person-centered psychotherapy into mainstream focus. The primary requirement was that the client be in receipt of three core [...] "conditions" [...] from his counselor or therapist: unconditional positive regard, sometimes described as [...] "prizing" [...] the client's humanity; congruence and empathic understanding. This type of interaction was thought to enable clients to fully experience and express themselves, and thus develop according to their innate potential. Others developed the approach, like Fritz and Laura Perls {{in the creation of}} Gestalt therapy, as well as Marshall Rosenberg, founder of Nonviolent Communication, and Eric Berne, founder of <b>transactional</b> <b>analysis.</b> Later these fields of psychotherapy would become what is known as humanistic psychotherapy today. Self-help groups and books became widespread.|$|E

For this purpose, more than 165. 000 visitors’ transaction data within three years (between July, 2010 and July, 2013) was obtained from Google Analytics and analyzed. The main findings showed that TL was a local journal. In addition to library and information science topics, general public and interdisciplinary topics were attracting more visitors. Visitors significantly preferred to download full-text documents rather than to display metadata. English Summary: Journal usage analysis is an important topic for authors/scholars, librarians and publishers for many years. When the literature on journal usage analysis reviewed, it is noteworthy that many analysis techniques have been developed and widely used to meet the needs of authors, publishers and librarians over time. Authors need these analyses for submitting their articles in appropriate journals by their quality or impact factor, librarians need them for collection development and publishers need it for benefit/profit. The {{purpose of this}} study was to conduct a <b>transactional</b> log <b>analysis</b> on Turkish Librarianship (TL) journal’s web site. For this purpose, after a brief literature review on development of electronic journals, their influences on stakeholders and journal usage analyses, more than 165. 000 visitors’ transaction data within three years (between July 2010 and July 2013) was obtained from Google Analytics and analyzed. In light of the findings of this study, the following results and recommendations could be reached: • TL was visited 169. 677 times and 715. 897 pages viewed by 124. 154 unique visitors. The average number of pages viewed per session was 4 and the average session duration was 198 seconds. TL was visited more in the academic semesters. • 96 percent of users visited the site from Turkey and its worldwide usage was limited. According to results TL was a local journal. The main reason could be the publication language which was mostly in Turkish. Adding English titles, abstracts and extended summaries to all types of documents (peer-reviewed articles, opinions, book review, meeting etc.) was not enough for increasing global visiting rate of TL. • Visitors significantly preferred to download full-text documents rather than to view metadata. On the other hand, there is a high positive correlation between full-text downloads and metadata views (especially abstracts). In decision process of document suitability for download or not, metadata could be evaluated by some of the visitors. • While the number of visitors coming to the site directly was very high, expected number of visitors coming from publisher’s web site was very low. Publisher’s (Turkish Librarians’ Association) web site should be revised in terms of usability. • In addition to library and information science topics, general public and interdisciplinary topics were attracting more visitors...|$|R

The <b>analysis</b> guarantees that shared data is always read and written from within a transaction, while allowing for unsynchronized access to thread-local and (shared) read-only data, {{as well as}} the migration of data between threads. The analysis is based on a type and effect system for object-oriented programs called partitions. Programmers specify a partitioning of the heap into disjoint regions at a field-level granularity, and then use this partitioning to enforce safety properties in their programs. Our flow-sensitive effect system requires methods to disclose which partitions of the heap they will read or write, and also allows them to specify an effect agreement which can be used to limit the conditions in which a method can be called. ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>transactional</b> and <b>analysis</b> systems each require a {{different}} database structure. In general, the database structure of transactional systems is optimized for consistency and efficient updates while the database structure of analysis systems is optimized for complex query performance. Non-spatial data are reorganized in data warehouses in order to support analysis and decision-making. In the same way, spatial data need to be stored in spatial data warehouses to support spatio-temporal decision-making. However, the actual client tools used to exploit the data warehouse are not well adapted to fully exploit the spatial data warehouse. New client tools are then required {{to take full advantage of}} the geometric component of the spatial data. GIS are potential candidates but despite interesting spatiotemporal analysis capabilities, it is recognized that actual GIS systems per se are not optimally designed to be used to support decision applications and that alternative solutions should be used (Bédard et al, 2001). Among them, the Spatial OLAP (SOLAP) tools offer promising possibilities. A SOLAP tool can be defined as “a visual platform built especially to support rapid and easy spatio-temporal analysis and exploration of data following a multidimensional approach comprised of aggregation levels available in cartographic displays as well as in tabular and diagram displays” (Bédard, 1997).

Traditional incremental timing analysis now represents {{the single greatest}} bottleneck in such optimizations and lacks the features necessary to support them efficiently. This article describes a paradigm of <b>transactional</b> timing <b>analysis,</b> which, together with incremental updates, offers an efficient, nested undo functionality that avoids significant timing calculations. ŠACHIEVING TIMING CLOSURE for large modern ASIC designs {{requires the use of}} physical synthesis a series of performance-driven optimizations that simultaneously alter the layout, the netlist, and the electrical parameters of logic gates. Physical synthesis tightly couples analysis with optimization in an automated flow that iteratively improves design parameters. Such flows rely on static timing analysis (STA) in two essential ways. First, STA identifies the sections of the design that are most critical to overall performance. Second, STA assesses the impact of every potential change on circuit performance before the change is committed. Circuit optimizations are bundled into transforms that implement common operations such as relocating a gate and buffering a net. 1 State-of-the-art physical design tools use compound transforms that simultaneously perform many simpler transforms that would not have improved overall performance if applied individually. 2 Advanced technology nodes require complex timing models that cannot be captured analytically with sufficient accuracy, often making timing analysis the single major bottleneck in physical synthesis. Therefore, we takeacloserlookattheconceptual role of STA and its interfaces with optimization. Mathematically, circuit optimizations often interact with STA by obtaining arrival times and required arrival times at timing points throughout the design. 3 However, running STA on the entire design to evaluate each potential change is impractical.
