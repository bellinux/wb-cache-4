40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the asset {{structure}} and the coverage of gross <b>technical</b> <b>reserves</b> of the Insurance – Reinsurance Company Astra SA, for the period 2003 – 2014. Insurance companies are required to constitute <b>technical</b> <b>reserves,</b> in order to cope with the payment obligations to policyholders. These reserves may only be covered on account of certain assets, admitted by law. In Romania, Orders No. 8 and 9 / 2011, issued by the Insurance Supervisory Commission, contain Rules regarding the assets admitted to cover gross <b>technical</b> <b>reserves,</b> the dispersion of assets admitted to cover gross <b>technical</b> <b>reserves</b> and the liquidity coefficient. Order No. 9 / 2011, relating to general insurance, has been amended by Rule No. 22 / 2014. In this paper, we have analyzed the main elements of Astra’s assets, their share in total assets and we have calculated the coverage of gross <b>technical</b> <b>reserves</b> by total assets and liquid assets. In 2013 and 2014, the value of total assets was below the value of gross tehnical reserves, which demonstrated Astra’s financial instability, through negative capital and the inability to meet the obligations to policyholders. Failure to comply with the prudential indicators has been one of the main causes of Astra`s bankruptcy. ...|$|E

Recently, this region has been hypothesized as a cultural frontier and is considered key to understanding ethnogenetic and cultural interaction processes in late pre-Columbian times. The reassessment of this old collection, which remained untouched for over 20 years, yielded unprecedented osteological (dental) data for the site.

The analysis refers to eleven OECD countries and takes into account the years from 1997 to 2008. Unlike most of the previous literature, we exploit European quarterly harmonized data on household financial assets and liabilities, which have been taken from the flow of funds. We measure not only the effect of total financial wealth on consumption, but we also consider the impact of a subset of those financial assets (i. e., quoted shares, mutual funds, insurance <b>technical</b> <b>reserves)</b> that are more linked to the Stock Exchange. Furthermore, we implement a recent econometric approach that allows for more flexible assumptions in the non-stationary panel framework under consideration.

Using quoted shares, mutual funds and insurance <b>technical</b> <b>reserves</b> as a measure of financial wealth, we obtain a lower estimate of the marginal propensity to consume, possibly due to the strong concentration of equity instruments in the richest households.
