500|$|Louise Nevelson {{has been}} a {{fundamental}} key in the feminist art movement. Credited with triggering the examination of femininity in art, Nevelson challenged the vision of what type of art women would be creating with her dark, monumental, masculine and totem-like artworks. Nevelson believed that art reflected the individual, not [...] "masculine-feminine labels", and chose to take on her role as an artist, not specifically a female artist. Reviews of Nevelson's works in the 1940s wrote her off as just a woman artist. A reviewer of her 1941 exhibition at Nierendorf Gallery stated: [...] "We learned the artist is a woman, in time to check our enthusiasm. Had it been otherwise, we might have hailed these sculptural expressions as by surely a great figure among moderns." [...] Another review was similar in its sexism: [...] "Nevelson is a sculptor; she comes from Portland, Maine. You'll deny both these facts and you might even insist Nevelson is a man, when you see her Portraits in Paint, showing <b>this</b> <b>month</b> <b>at</b> the Nierendorf Gallery." ...|$|E

Instant at Pyritz in Prussia on his Journey to England, {{he died of a}} violent Cramp in his Stomach, after a confinement of about Nine Weeks." [...] He went on to offer himself as a replacement in Corry’s job as His Majesty’s Commissary and states several reasons why he was well suited for it. The next letter was from the previous occupant of Corry’s post, Archibald Gibson, a Scot, who recommended his son, Alexander, as a replacement. Alexander also wrote to apply for the job saying he could get references from several people including the King of Poland. Alexander went on to suggest that Corry's conduct had not always been entirely virtuous, [...] "Sir Trevor Corry held the Post of Commissary without receiving a Sallary, but he have to make it worth a great deal to him by misemploying the Protection the dignity of his Place granted him." [...] Perhaps implying that the lack of any remuneration encouraged corruption, he requested [...] "I beg leave to observe to your Excellency that a small appointment as Sallary will render this dignity more respectable as all the other accredited Gentlemen here have an allowance from their Courts." [...] Alexander Gibson was successful in his application. Alexander Gibson was to become the second and last migrant from Britain to be made a baron by a Polish monarch. On this occasion it was by Friedrich II King of Prussia.|$|E
