5|$|A Writer's Diary is a {{collection}} mainly of essays and articles, which also include, for example, answers to readers, introductions, etc., making <b>the</b> <b>Diaries</b> a journal-like book written and mostly edited by Dostoyevsky.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchase}} of <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> continued, and by June 1982 Gruner + Jahr possessed 35 volumes. In early 1983 the company took {{the decision to}} work towards a publication date for <b>the</b> <b>diaries.</b> To ensure wide readership and to maximise their returns, Stern issued a prospectus to potentially interested parties, Newsweek, Time, Paris Match and a syndicate of papers owned by Murdoch. Stern rented a large vault in a Swiss bank. They filled the space with Nazi memorabilia and displayed various letters and manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchases}} of <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> continued throughout {{mid to late}} 1981: Gruner + Jahr gave Heidemann 345,000DMs on 29 July, and a further 220,000DMs a week later, which brought the total up to 1.81millionDMs {{since the start of}} the year. This sum had purchased 18 diaries for the company. Schulte-Hillen, the new managing director, signed an authorisation for a further million DMs for future purchases. Just over two weeks later he signed a further authorisation for 600,000DMs after Heidemann told him that the cost of <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> had now risen to 200,000DMs each; Heidemann also passed on the news that there were more than 27 diaries.|$|E
50|$|Falk kept a diary {{containing}} {{records of}} dreams and the Kabbalistic names of angels. This {{can be found}} in the library of the United Synagogue in London. In 2002 Michal Oren published <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> and a biography of Falk. <b>The</b> <b>diary</b> is written in Hebrew and is very cryptic. <b>The</b> <b>diary</b> was published together with <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> of Falk's assistant, Tsvee Hirsch of Kalish.|$|R
5000|$|With Otto Frank's {{death in}} 1980, <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>diary,</b> including letters and loose sheets, were willed to the Dutch Institute for War Documentation, which commissioned a forensic study of <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> through <b>the</b> Netherlands Ministry of Justice in 1986. They examined the handwriting against known examples {{and found that}} they matched. They determined that the paper, glue, and ink were readily available during <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> {{was said to have}} been written. They concluded that <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> is authentic, and their findings were published in what has become known as the [...] "Critical Edition" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>diary.</b> On 23 March 1990, the Hamburg Regional Court confirmed <b>the</b> <b>diary's</b> authenticity.|$|R
500|$|In 1986 the Dutch Institute for War Documentation {{published}} the [...] "Critical Edition" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>diary.</b> It includes comparisons from all known versions, both edited and unedited. It includes discussion asserting <b>the</b> <b>diary's</b> authentication, {{as well as}} additional historical information relating to the family and <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> itself.|$|R
5|$|According {{to one of}} her biographers, Giles St Aubyn, Victoria {{wrote an}} average of 2,500 words a day during her adult life. From July 1832 until just before her death, she kept a {{detailed}} journal, which eventually encompassed 122 volumes. After Victoria's death, her youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice, was appointed her literary executor. Beatrice transcribed and edited <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> covering Victoria's accession onwards, and burned the originals in the process. Despite this destruction, much of <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> still exist. In addition to Beatrice's edited copy, Lord Esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before Beatrice destroyed them. Part of Victoria's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by A. C. Benson, Hector Bolitho, George Earle Buckle, Lord Esher, Roger Fulford, and Richard Hough among others.|$|E
5|$|DGM publishes on-line diaries by RobertFripp, David Singleton and The Vicar. A moderated forum allows fans to ask {{questions}} or to leave comments. Together, <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> and the fanforum display delayeddialogs in which the artists and fans discuss diary-entries and forum-postings. Fripp's public writing of his diary has challenged his readers to become more active listeners and intelligent participants in performances of music.|$|E
5|$|Dostoyevsky wrote {{articles}} and essays outside <b>the</b> <b>Diaries</b> collection. These include the 1863 travelogue Winter Notes on Summer Impressions, {{in which he}} satirised and criticised European life. Other articles were written in response or as a criticism to a literary work, a person's view, requests to the military during the imprisonment period, announcements, notes and explanations. Some of them were written for different journals or almanacs.|$|E

5000|$|When <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> {{was first}} published, many South Korean media outlets {{reported}} {{it as being}} definitive evidence that Korean comfort women were forcibly recruited by the Japanese military, but Choi Kilsong has dismissed the idea that <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> supports this theory. An Byeong-jik concurs that <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> contains no information about forcible recruitment of comfort women, stating that, [...] "Comfort women were recruited by business operators in Korea, {{and there was no}} need for the military to abduct them." [...] However, <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> entries of <b>the</b> year 1942, which might have dealt in more detail with how the comfort women at Mr. Park's brothel were recruited, are missing from <b>the</b> <b>diary.</b>|$|R

5|$|In December 2008, Ocean Press, in {{cooperation}} with the Che Guevara Publishing Project, released Che: <b>The</b> <b>Diaries</b> of Ernesto Che Guevara, with a movie tie-in cover. The book's aim was to compile all the original letters, diary excerpts, speeches and maps on which Soderbergh relied for the film. The text is interspersed with remarks by Benicio del Toro and Steven Soderbergh.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{government}} announcement appeared on television, Kujau took {{his wife and}} mistress to Austria; he introduced the latter to Edith as his cleaner. After he saw a news report a few days later, naming him as the forger, and hearing that Stern had paid ninemillion DMs, he first phoned his lawyer and then the Hamburg State prosecutor; the forger agreed to hand himself in at the border between Austria and West Germany the following day. When police raided his house, they found several notebooks identical to those used in the fraud. Kujau continued to use {{a variation of the}} story he had told Heidemann—that of obtaining <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> from the East—but he was bitter that the journalist was still at liberty, and had withheld so much of Sterns money from him. After thirteen days, on 26 May, he wrote a full confession, stating that Heidemann knew all along that <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> were forgeries. Heidemann was arrested that evening.|$|E

5|$|The main {{sources for}} the {{proceedings}} and vote-counts of the conclave come from the accounts Enrico Dandolo of Venice, Simon Renard (the Imperial ambassador to France), and Diego de Mendoza (ambassador to Charles V), the correspondences between Henry II and Guise and d'Este, and <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> of the various conclavists.

40|$|Most of the Flemish {{authors who}} are {{traditionally}} {{associated with the}} so-called experimental movement published <b>diaries</b> in <b>the</b> late 1960 s and the 1970 s. This article provides some explanation for this generation’s predilection for <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> genre, a proclivity that can also be noticed in the United States of America and Canada. Starting from a discussion on the definition of <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> genre, I use three theses {{to shed light on}} this phenomenon. First of all, the fact that <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> genre has historically been considered as a subgenre. Secondly, <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> is a place of freedom and allows a lot of literary experimentation. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> is a genre that powerfully defies history and its linearity...|$|R
50|$|William Holland (9 May 1746 - 17 April 1819) is now {{best remembered}} for his diary, which he kept from 1799 to 1818. <b>The</b> <b>diary</b> chronicles {{his life as}} the vicar of Over Stowey, Somerset. In a similar fashion to <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> of Thomas Turner, Holland's diary is a {{personal}} consideration of the workings of country life {{during a time of}} considerable national tension. <b>The</b> <b>diary</b> is broad in scope, with limited discussion of national events such as the Napoleonic Wars occurring alongside treatment of local matters. Not all of <b>the</b> <b>diary's</b> original 99 volumes survive; particularly, entries written {{both before and after the}} current known time-span of <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> are thought to have existed.|$|R
5|$|Arrington donated his {{research}} and personal papers to Utah State University, and also donated microfilms of his pre-1982 diaries to the LDS Church Archives, {{with the condition}} that <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> not be read until 25 years after his death. However, the LDS Church broke the agreement when shortly after Arrington's death they argued that they owned part of the collection, and asked Arrington's daughter to excise portions of Arrington's diary. After legal negotiation, half of a box of the collection {{was given to the}} LDS Church Archives.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII {{encouraged}} {{his niece}} {{to write her}} memoirs, as he wished them {{to be used as}} Bourbon propaganda. In 1796 and 1803, Louis also used <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> of Louis XVI's final attendants in the same way. In January 1801, Tsar Paul told Louis XVIII that he could no longer live in Russia. The court at Jelgava was so low on funds that it had to auction some of its possessions to afford the journey out of Russia. Marie-Thérèse even sold a diamond necklace that the Emperor Paul had given her as a wedding gift.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} serious post-war studies of Meyerbeer and grand opera was Crosten's 1948 book Grand Opera: An Art and a Business which laid out the themes and {{standards}} for much subsequent research. A major contribution to revival of interest in Meyerbeer {{was the work of}} the scholar Heinz Becker, leading to the complete publication, between 1960 and 2006, of Meyerbeer's complete diaries and correspondence in German, which are an important source for musical history of the era. The English scholar Robert Letellier has translated <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> and undertaken a wide range of Meyerbeer studies. Not least, the establishment of a 'Meyerbeer Fan Club' in America has stimulated interest.|$|E
25|$|James Woodforde (1740–1803) was an English clergyman, {{known as}} the author of <b>The</b> <b>Diary</b> of a Country Parson. <b>The</b> <b>diary</b> was {{published}} posthumously in the 20th century.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Diary</b> of a Young Girl, {{also known}} as <b>The</b> <b>Diary</b> of Anne Frank, is a book of the {{writings}} from <b>the</b> Dutch language <b>diary</b> kept by Anne Frank {{while she was in}} hiding for two years with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. The family was apprehended in 1944, and Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. <b>The</b> <b>diary</b> was retrieved by Miep Gies, who gave it to Anne's father, Otto Frank, the family's only known survivor, just after the war was over. <b>The</b> <b>diary</b> has since been published in more than 60 languages.|$|R
5|$|The James Bond series {{focuses on}} a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who {{featured}} him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is Trigger Mortis by Anthony Horowitz, published in September 2015. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> of a recurring series character, Moneypenny.|$|E
5|$|At {{that first}} meeting on 28 January 1981, which lasted over seven hours, Heidemann offered Kujau a deposit of only 100,000DMs to agree the deal, which Kujau did not accept. At a second meeting the {{following}} day, the reporter revealed an additional lure {{he had brought}} with him: a uniform which he said was Göring's. Kujau tentatively agreed to provide <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> and told Heidemann that he would call {{him as soon as}} he could arrange to receive them from East Germany. As a sign of good faith Heidemann lent the uniform to the forger, to show alongside his collection of other uniforms from the top Nazis; for his part, Kujau gave the journalist a painting purportedly by Hitler. Both the painting and uniform were fakes.|$|E
5|$|Author Michael Occleshaw {{made the}} claim in his 1995 book The Romanov Conspiracies: The Romanovs and the House of Windsor that Tatiana {{might have been}} rescued and transported to England, where she married a British officer and lived under the name Larissa Tudor. Occleshaw based this claim on {{studying}} <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> of the British agent Richard Meinertzhagen, who hinted at the successful liberation of a Grand Duchess, allegedly Tatiana. However, historians discount this claim. Survival stories persist because two bodies were missing from the mass grave found in the forest outside Yekaterinburg and exhumed in 1991. Those bodies were identified as Tsarevich Alexei {{and one of the}} four grand duchesses, generally thought by Russians to be Grand Duchess Maria and by Americans to be Grand Duchess Anastasia. Most historians believe that all of the Romanovs, including Tatiana, were assassinated at Ekaterinburg.|$|E
