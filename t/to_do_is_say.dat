[...] Although the singer knows how messy and rough love can be, he claims that he is ready for it, but insists that the woman must also be equally tough and willing to take chances. [...] The song is in some ways reminiscent of Springsteen's earlier song [...] "Thunder Road", in which the singer wants to take the woman away, even though he tells her that [...] "you ain't a beauty but hey you're alright". But unlike the earlier song, in this song the singer's goals are more realistic — rather than looking to run away with the woman, here he just wants to ask the woman to dance.In the context of this song the phrase, 'There's another dance, all you have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>say</b> yes,' is an allusion to taking a chance and falling in love.This is echoed in the song 'Girls in their Summer Clothes' which includes the line 'Love's a fools' dance, I ain't got no sense, but I've still got my feet.' ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} Sabbac {{is depicted}} as a [...] "dark opposite" [...] to the Marvels, similar to Captain Marvel's foe Ibac, who draws his powers from four historical villains. The dark forces of Hell gave the human Timothy Karnes (alternatively spelt as Barnes) the power to become a being with powers to rival Captain Marvel. To access this power, all Karnes has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>say</b> the magic word [...] "Sabbac", and magic black lightning strikes up from the underworld and transforms him into a muscle-bound demon with super-strength, super-speed, flight, fire breath, {{and the ability to}} emit fire blasts from the palms of his hands. His powers match those of the Marvels. Like Captain Marvel's magic word [...] "Shazam", the word Sabbac is an acronym for the six beings who empower Sabbac: the demons Satan, Aym, Belial, Beelzebub, Asmodeus, and Crateis. He resembles Timothy in green robes. Sabbac was an enemy of Captain Marvel, Jr.. Sabbac appeared in two issues of the Golden Age Captain Marvel Jr. comic book (issues 4 and 6, both from 1943), and in two issues each of World's Finest Comics and Adventure Comics during the early 1980s. When he first appears he joins Nazi agents, being promised power over America if he helps them conquer it, and tries to destroy transport lines to isolate East and West America. However, as he continues to battle Jr. the various demons empowering him leave him as things grow increasingly bleak for the villain, removing his powers until Satan leaves him, allowing him to be defeated.|$|E

Cedric then appears on stage and begins to sing about how {{he wants to make}} a name for himself by impressing the King and making it snow. When Sofia asks for the sorcerer's help, Cedric eventually agrees. He tells the princess that all she needs <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>say</b> the spell with confidence. Although Sofia wants to do her spell, Cedric tells her that she cannot because he needs to do his own spell to make it snow for the ball.

After retrieving the book, Cedric is about to try his spell again, when the group hears the announcement that the Royal Guests are arriving. Cedric becomes too nervous to perform the spell. Sofia, along with the audience, says the spell together, which makes it begin to snow. Taking what she has learned, Sofia tries her spell again, this time [...] "slow and steady."

You people have not been trained the way I have been trained, dealing with judges like Judge Wyatt who threw my conspiracy count out, and other judges like Borelli who made the same kind of sophisticated analysis of conspiracy law. Your natural assumption is that we will go in all or nothing because in every case we have gotten away with it. I am telling you that in this case you didn't get away with it. If you had been a competent prosecutor, which you are not, you would have hedged against the possibility that maybe the judge would disagree with you. But it never occurs in the mind of you or anyone in your office that any trial judge will ever disagree with you on the law. Therefore, you do what you want in the face of clear admonitions from the court that these were dice you were rolling. Let's assume I am wrong; let's assume I am erroneous. A competent prosecutor would have hedged against the possibility that the judge might be wrong and decide an issue against the Government, and you put in a separate conspiracy count just to cover that possibility. If these drug dealers are walking free, it is because you did not hedge against that possibility. Don't lay it at my doorstep. I think I am right on the law. But even if I am wrong on the law, if they are walking out of here it is because you people were not competent enough to put in an extra charge in your indictment. Sit down.|$|E

40|$|Chaos {{is a type}} of {{nonlinear}} behavior {{characterized by}} sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Chaotic systems can be deterministic, yet unpredictable. Linear systems are solvable because of superposition. Nonlinear systems are often not solvable in an exact sense. Phase space is a way to find the qualitative behavior of nonlinear systems.

The logistic map provides an example of a system that bifurcates into chaos in a relatively well-understood way.

I thought that you {{probably}} would try but someone said there weren’t any telephones except in town and since you were restricted didn’t think that you’d be able to. Not sure what time you called. Mrs. M said about an hour after I’d left. That must have been about six your time. About then Doris + Betty Jo + I were waiting for Julie to get ready. I thought about you all day + night, honey. Didn’t find out about your calling until this morning. It’s hard to write because I’m lying {{out in the back}} yard in the sun trying to get a suntan. Probably won’t get anything more than sunstroke. Lord it sure is hot. Golly, darling, I wish you’d get through that fool course in ten days. That would be marvelous. But it will undoubtedly pour or snow or something. How many hours do you have to have before they send you back to Craig? You really should get overseas pay. There should be something done about that. Every time the sun goes behind the cloud I write some more. Well, it’s too hot for me. Had to go sit on the front porch in the shade. It’s nice and cool here. Let’s see, where was I – oh, yes, I don’t suppose there’s much chance of your getting back in ten days? Golly, that would be marvelous. I just don’t want to think about it. Last night after the movies, we went to see “Murder my Sweet”. We went to the hotel. Just on the change that there might be save mail + sure enough. I almost died. There were two letters from you. What a surprise. Well, honey loads of things have been happening to me lately. Golly, I’ve met more people! Can’t remember any of their names but they were all so nice. Julie has a boyfriend named George Harvey + what a car. It’s almost a block long, light green “convertible” of course. Gee, it’s sharp. We’ll have to get a car, honey. Oh, if we go home on your leave, we could get one there + the ration board would give us enough gas to drive back to your next Post. Cars down here are awfully expensive. Golly, talk about an arm + a leg. They want the whole body! You were saying they send out a man to get the papers. That reminded me – Since we left Pelham I haven’t seen more than two papers. Haven’t the slightest idea how the war is going. Yesterday saw “Blondie” but outside of that I’m worse off than you are. I’m very contented here in silence. Like it a lot and would be awfully happy if you were here. It’s really a nice place. Of course the food is supposed to be awful but I didn’t think it was so bad. All the Officers say the food in the Officer’s Club is lousey [sic]. They bring their lunch. It’s a riot. Everyone says {{you should be able to}} live off the Post, honey, as long as you pay for your BOQ + get back in time. You’re supposed to fire 3, 000 rounds in the 17 days? Golly, darling, you’ll be there forever at that rate. How many have you fired so far. You’d have to fire 300 rounds a day to get through in ten days. Guess there’s not much chance of that. How long does it take to shoot a hundred? It sounds like hard work but probably is fun. Gee, I wish you’d hurry home. Oh, do they go by the number of hours you fly down there? How soon do you think you’ll be home? Seventeen days? How’s the weather? Golly, darling, I miss your not coming home at nights + getting up at those ungodly hours of the night to get you back to camp on time. Your pajama tops are going to be worn out soon. You’d better hurry home if you ever want to wear them again. You’ve probably gotten my letter by now. You must have since you called here telling you where I’m staying. Mrs. M. has been real nice to me + if her daughter-in-law doesn’t come we’ll probably stay here. I’d rather get the apartment across the street if possible because we’d have a private bath + we’d be more alone there. That Lt. sure looks sharp on the envelope.

Still don’t think we should count until you get back because we’re not together + haven’t been long enough to make it fair. We’ll have to start all over again. How are Tom + D. A. ? Does Tom still like Janet? Haven’t heard him speak of her in ages. Say hello to them both for me. I’m beginning to have trouble- meeting people. They’re beginning to conflict. They all want to do something at the same time. Like tonight. Supposed to see Julie, Bettie Jo + Doris + the girls next door. It’s going to be confusing. Last night the girls next door were out with two captains. One was from N. Y. + the other knew Dick Mullineaux- He’d been in China with him. Did you know Dick? He was reported missing over Jap territory last June, I think. It seemed so funny to see someone who knew where Pelham was. I was really amazed. One of the captains- think his name was Cook- instructs the French. Anyway I had been telling one of the girls that you could speak a little French or something so she told the captain. He wanted to know your name but I wouldn’t tell him. He said they need French instructors. All you have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>say</b> one word with a slight accent + you were it. But I told him you wouldn’t like it + probably couldn’t speak French anymore. I know you probably wouldn’t want to be an instructor because you want to go over so much. Didn’t know what to say but told him you wouldn’t like it. Would you? I’d love it- But I know you sorta want to go over. Of course you really could do much more as an instructor than you could as a pilot overseas. Because as an instructor you’d be able to train several men to fight + as a pilot overseas there’d be just you. Oh well, I suppose you know all that. But you did say you’d like to try it. I’d like you to be an instructor here now that I know so many people. Besides, I could be with you longer but of course you are the one who counts most about that. All this is just day dreaming. But you should be used to the way I ramble by now. Golly, darling, I’ve gotten a sunburn. You should see me. The front of my legs are real red but the backs are exactly the same. At least I look healthy from the front. Gee, I love you so, honey. It’s so awful to have to be away from you now, Judd. I miss you more + more every day. What have you been doing? Anything unusual. Wonder how long you’ll be stationed around here, darling. Hope you’re not sent over for years. Gee, honey, does it seem as though we’d been married for eight days to you? It just isn’t fair. It seems as though you’d been away for years. How long do you think you’ll be there? If you’re going to come home early let me know if possible so that I can wash my hair + look half way decent. Oh, honey, I wish that I were here when you called. Let me know if you have any plants for calling again so that I’ll be here. Golly I was so disappointed when I heard about it. Didn’t think you knew where I was yet. Well, darling, I guess I’d better get ready to go to town to eat. I love you so much, Judd. More than I’d ever dreamed possible. It’s wonderful to be so much in love but horrible to be separated. Well, darling, be a good little boy + hurry up + finish everything down at Eglin + come back to me real quick. You’re so wonderful, Judd. I love you so much, honey. Being in love with you is the nicest thing that ever happened to me. Golly, I’m glad we’re married. Oh, are you getting rested? What do you do when you don’t fly? Try to catch up on your sleep, honey, I just don’t enjoy going to bed anymore. It’s terrible. Golly, I’ll be glad when you’re back again. Every minute we’re apart seems so long. There’s four girls around here that I met today + they’re all going to have baby. The people are awful here- If you don’t have a dog or a baby they won’t rent you a room. Great isn’t it. Well, darling, I hope you’re back real soon. I miss you so. You’re so sweet, darling and I love you. Wish you were here now. Miss your arms + being kissed + you. It shouldn’t be long now, honey, but it will seem like a million years. I love you + will love you always- more + more every day. Your devoted wife, Dottie P. S. I love you, my darling husband- I can’t believe it. Golly especially when you’re so far away! I love you.

That I won’t think about. Going to eat breakfast. Wait a sec. How do you like Eglin, honey? Like “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo? Everyone says Aux Co. is the worst place in the world to be. We certainly are lucky. It’s awful how long seventeen days can be. It already seems way over a year. I’ll have to write to everyone soon.

Did I tell you that some fool maid over at the hotel threw away my box for Mr. O’Leery + Pinkie? And she also threw away our book. (Together reminded me of the sense of oneness). You should have seen me trying to move with all the junk I had. Your B- 4 bag is really marvelous. We’ll really need a foot locker for me. That will help loads. If it doesn’t take a year to get there. Monday My darling husband, Honey, I’m so mad that I wasn’t home when you called last night. I thought that you probably would try but someone said there weren’t any telephones except in town and since you were restricted didn’t think that you’d be able to. Not sure what time you called. Mrs. M said about an hour after I’d left. That must have been about six your time. About then Doris + Betty Jo + I were waiting for Julie to get ready. I thought about you all day + night, honey. Didn’t find out about your calling until this morning. It’s hard to write because I’m lying out in the back yard in the sun trying to get a suntan. Probably won’t get anything more than sunstroke. Lord it sure is hot. Golly, darling, I wish you’d get through that fool course in ten days. That would be marvelous. But it will undoubtedly pour or snow or something. How many hours do you have to have before they send you back to Craig? You really should get overseas pay. There should be something done about that. Every time the sun goes behind the cloud I write some more. Well, it’s too hot for me. Had to go sit on the front porch in the shade. It’s nice and cool here. Let’s see, where was I – oh, yes, I don’t suppose there’s much chance of your getting back in ten days? Golly, that would be marvelous. I just don’t want to think about it. Last night after the movies, we went to see “Murder my Sweet”. We went to the hotel. Just on the change that there might be save mail + sure enough. I almost died. There were two letters from you. What a surprise. Well, honey loads of things have been happening to me lately. Golly, I’ve met more people! Can’t remember any of their names but they were all so nice. Julie has a boyfriend named George Harvey + what a car. It’s almost a block long, light green “convertible” of course. Gee, it’s sharp. We’ll have to get a car, honey. Oh, if we go home on your leave, we could get one there + the ration board would give us enough gas to drive back to your next Post. Cars down here are awfully expensive. Golly, talk about an arm + a leg. They want the whole body! You were saying they send out a man to get the papers. That reminded me – Since we left Pelham I haven’t seen more than two papers. Haven’t the slightest idea how the war is going. Yesterday saw “Blondie” but outside of that I’m worse off than you are. I’m very contented here in silence. Like it a lot and would be awfully happy if you were here. It’s really a nice place. Of course the food is supposed to be awful but I didn’t think it was so bad. All the Officers say the food in the Officer’s Club is lousey [sic]. They bring their lunch. It’s a riot. Everyone says you should be able to live off the Post, honey, as long as you pay for your BOQ + get back in time. You’re supposed to fire 3, 000 rounds in the 17 days? Golly, darling, you’ll be there forever at that rate. How many have you fired so far. You’d have to fire 300 rounds a day to get through in ten days. Guess there’s not much chance of that. How long does it take to shoot a hundred? It sounds like hard work but probably is fun. Gee, I wish you’d hurry home. Oh, do they go by the number of hours you fly down there? How soon do you think you’ll be home? Seventeen days? How’s the weather? Golly, darling, I miss your not coming home at nights + getting up at those ungodly hours of the night to get you back to camp on time. Your pajama tops are going to be worn out soon. You’d better hurry home if you ever want to wear them again. You’ve probably gotten my letter by now. You must have since you called here telling you where I’m staying. Mrs. M. has been real nice to me + if her daughter-in-law doesn’t come we’ll probably stay here. I’d rather get the apartment across the street if possible because we’d have a private bath + we’d be more alone there. That Lt. sure looks sharp on the envelope. I love addressing envelopes now- writing Lt. + Mrs. That I like. Golly darling in another forty minutes we’ll have been married eight days! Still don’t think we should count until you get back because we’re not together + haven’t been long enough to make it fair. We’ll have to start all over again. How are Tom + D. A. ? Does Tom still like Janet? Haven’t heard him speak of her in ages. Say hello to them both for me. I’m beginning to have trouble- meeting people. They’re beginning to conflict. They all want to do something at the same time. Like tonight. Supposed to see Julie, Bettie Jo + Doris + the girls next door. It’s going to be confusing. Last night the girls next door were out with two captains. One was from N. Y. + the other knew Dick Mullineaux- He’d been in China with him. Did you know Dick? He was reported missing over Jap territory last June, I think. It seemed so funny to see someone who knew where Pelham was. I was really amazed. One of the captains- think his name was Cook- instructs the French. Anyway I had been telling one of the girls that you could speak a little French or something so she told the captain. He wanted to know your name but I wouldn’t tell him. He said they need French instructors. All you have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>say</b> one word with a slight accent + you were it. But I told him you wouldn’t like it + probably couldn’t speak French anymore. I know you probably wouldn’t want to be an instructor because you want to go over so much. Didn’t know what to say but told him you wouldn’t like it. Would you? I’d love it- But I know you sorta want to go over. Of course you really could do much more as an instructor than you could as a pilot overseas. Because as an instructor you’d be able to train several men to fight + as a pilot overseas there’d be just you. Oh well, I suppose you know all that. But you did say you’d like to try it. I’d like you to be an instructor here now that I know so many people. Besides, I could be with you longer but of course you are the one who counts most about that. All this is just day dreaming. But you should be used to the way I ramble by now. Golly, darling, I’ve gotten a sunburn. You should see me. The front of my legs are real red but the backs are exactly the same. At least I look healthy from the front. Gee, I love you so, honey. It’s so awful to have to be away from you now, Judd. I miss you more + more every day. What have you been doing? Anything unusual. Wonder how long you’ll be stationed around here, darling. Hope you’re not sent over for years. Gee, honey, does it seem as though we’d been married for eight days to you? It just isn’t fair. It seems as though you’d been away for years. How long do you think you’ll be there? If you’re going to come home early let me know if possible so that I can wash my hair + look half way decent. Oh, honey, I wish that I were here when you called. Let me know if you have any plants for calling again so that I’ll be here. Golly I was so disappointed when I heard about it. Didn’t think you knew where I was yet. Well, darling, I guess I’d better get ready to go to town to eat. I love you so much, Judd. More than I’d ever dreamed possible. It’s wonderful to be so much in love but horrible to be separated. Well, darling, be a good little boy + hurry up + finish everything down at Eglin + come back to me real quick. You’re so wonderful, Judd. I love you so much, honey. Being in love with you is the nicest thing that ever happened to me. Golly, I’m glad we’re married. Oh, are you getting rested? What do you do when you don’t fly? Try to catch up on your sleep, honey, I just don’t enjoy going to bed anymore. It’s terrible. Golly, I’ll be glad when you’re back again. Every minute we’re apart seems so long. There’s four girls around here that I met today + they’re all going to have baby. The people are awful here- If you don’t have a dog or a baby they won’t rent you a room. Great isn’t it. Well, darling, I hope you’re back real soon. I miss you so. You’re so sweet, darling and I love you. Wish you were here now. Miss your arms + being kissed + you. It shouldn’t be long now, honey, but it will seem like a million years. I love you + will love you always- more + more every day. Your devoted wife, Dottie P. S. I love you, my darling husband- I can’t believe it. Golly especially when you’re so far away! I love you.

A strange, small man appeared and told him {{in order to get}} a ruby from the tree, he had to say one thousand. At first, Jorn thought he had to count to one thousand for a ruby to fall, but the small man made him realize that all he had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>say</b> the words “one thousand” for a ruby to fall. Jorn filled the silver chalice, but the small man disappeared and a black knight called Duff of the Dolorous Doom appeared before him. They engaged in a sword fight and battled until Jorn stabbed the knight near the right shoulder. When Duff fell, his helmet fell off and revealed the face of an old man. Feeling regret for his action, Jorn helped Duff and tended the wound. Duff told him about how he came face-to-face with the Mok-Mok on a quest to win a woman’s love and was appalled that the Mok-Mok was just a harmless thing of clay and wood. “This is the Dolorous Doom of one who rode not home to claim his lady’s hand--that each and every Maytime till I die, I must be overthrown by love which once I overthrew,” Duff said. His lady cast a spell on Duff so that his armor is Strength, but the flaw underneath is Pride. Jorn gathered the rubies in the chalice and rode back to the castle (Thurber, 78-88).|$|R
