There is extensive documentation from the 12th century of transactions between Undløse and Sorø Abbey. The Roskilde cadaster from 1370 lists the <b>taxation</b> <b>schedule</b> for Undløse Church. Correspondence from 1357 to 1492 documents the early pilgrimages to Undløse and the various related religious ceremonies, all encouraged by a nearby sacred source. An indulgence communication from 1421 refers to the consecration of altars to Our Lady, St Lawrence and St Catherine. In 1441, the Bishop of the Faroes consecrated a chapel and altar to St Olaf and, in 1492, a letter mentions an altar to St Anne. In 1687, the church came into the ownership of Valdemar Christoffer Gabel (1650-1725), whereafter it was the property of Kongsdal until it became fully independent in 1910.|$|E
40|$|In {{an economy}} where agents are {{characterized}} by different productivities (vertical types) and different abilities to move (horizontal types), we compare a unified nonlinear optimal <b>taxation</b> <b>schedule</b> with the equilibrium <b>taxation</b> <b>schedule</b> that would be chosen by two competing tax authorities if the same economy {{were divided into two}} States. The overall level of progressivity and redistribution is unambiguously lower under competitive taxation than under unified taxation; the “rich ” are always in favor of competing authorities and local governments, whereas the “poor ” are always in favor of unified taxation. The constitutional choice between fiscal regimes depends on the preferences of the middle class, which in turn depend on the initial conditions in terms of the distribution of abilities (incomes), the relative power of the various classes, and mobility costs. In particular, as mobility increases, it becomes increasingly likely that a reform in the direction of unification of fiscal policies in a federation will receive majority support, while a decreased average wealth can have the opposite effect...|$|E

Contrary to the related literature individual well-being depends not just on income but also on prices. We show that, when the environment is restricted such that a general transformation class still can be defined, the only "desirable" fiscal rule is the simple redistributive linear <b>taxation</b> <b>schedule,</b> of the same type that is the rule in practice in most economies. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical model {{to investigate the}} effect of heterogeneous ideological preferences over the public provision of goods on both the scope of government spending and the electoral competition among political parties. The proposed model {{points out that the}} presence of both ideological politicians who compete for of ce and electoral uncertainty generate a partisanship effect on economic policy. In particular, pro-market (right-wing) politicians commit to lower public provision of goods and income <b>taxation</b> <b>schedules</b> that implement larger income inequality than pro-government (left-wing) politicians. The model also predicts that the public funding of godos through income taxation confers an electoral advantage to pro-market ideological positions. In fact, pro-market politicians can court moderate pro-leftist voters by promises of higher net income that pro-government politicians are not willing to fund. As a result, a right-wing party exhibits larger chances of winning elections, and its policy proposal determines lower ideological sacri�ce than for the left-wing party. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{test whether}} very high {{marginal}} tax rates affect taxpayer behaviour, using a unique policy. Under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme – an income-related college loans scheme in Australia – taxpayers {{with a college}} debt face a sharp discontinuity. At the repayment threshold, {{they are required to}} repay a percentage of their entire income, resulting in marginal tax rate that could be regarded as being as high as 76, 000 percent. We formally model the taxpayer decision, and then use a sample of taxpayer returns provided to us by the tax office to investigate whether taxpayers bunch below the repayment threshold. We find a statistically significant degree of bunching below the threshold, but the effect is economically small. On net, we estimate that both the deadweight cost and the budgetary loss are less than A$ 1 million per year, {{a small fraction of the}} amount annually repaid through the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. This suggests that the Australian design of the scheme may be superior to the manner in which income-related college loans programs have been designed in other countries. Our findings also reinforce earlier research suggesting only minimal bunching around kink points in <b>taxation</b> <b>schedules.</b> JEL Classification: H 31, H 5...|$|R

40|$|In {{an economy}} where agents have {{heterogeneous}} abilities and horizontally differentiated location preferences, we compare a unified nonlinear optimal <b>taxation</b> <b>schedule</b> with the equilibrium taxation schedules {{that would be}} chosen by two competing tax authorities if the same economy {{were divided into two}} States. This is the first analysis of competitive nonlinear income taxation, with unobserved heterogeneity in both vertical (ability) and horizontal (location preference) dimensions. We show that with competitive taxation the overall level of progressivity and redistribution is lower, and the welfare comparison is favorable to a unified system. If citizens could choose by majority rule (constitutional stage) whether to have unified taxation institutions or competitive tax authorities, the choice would depend on the initial distribution of abilities (incomes) and the intensity of location preferences. The rich should always be in favor of competing authorities and local governments, whereas the poor should always be in favor of unified taxation. The preferences of the middle class depend on the initial conditions...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I {{consider}} optimal redistributive {{income taxation}} under a Mirrleesian framework while adding utility interdependence over labor choice and analyze whether the optimal tax schedule is regressive or progressive. In this environment, I show that optimal marginal income taxation could be progressive {{depending on the}} parameters of the model. There are two separate forces that are at work in determining the optimal tax schedule. First, due to the informational problems, there is a usual Mirrleesian force that works towards the regressivity of taxes. Second effect is a novel force that arises from labor externality and has a progressive effect on the income tax. This effect could be called as Pigouvian tax. Labor externality requires subsidies for agents which are asymmetric according to productivities. Because of this asymmetry, there should be higher subsidies for low types which has a progressive effect on the optimal tax schedule. Pigouvian and Mirrleesian effects are in a multiplicative form in the tax function, therefore the tax schedule is identified by the effect which is more powerful. I also show that, when we consider the labor interdependence, zero tax {{at the top of the}} skill distribution result is no longer valid. Additionally, I show that even under full information the market is not efficient and there is a need for progressive income taxes, as there is a need to correct the labor externality. Moreover, the numerical examples of the paper show the progressive effect of labor externality on the tax schedule. This additional concern about labor externality makes the income <b>taxation</b> <b>schedule</b> more consistent with the current tax policies...|$|E

30|$|The {{disaggregation}} {{of direct}} <b>taxation</b> into <b>schedules,</b> {{tax credits and}} a part attributable to tax allowances showed that redistribution is effected mainly via the schedules. The redistributive effect of tax schedules {{is largely due to}} their size {{and to a lesser extent}} to their progressivity. Neither tax allowances nor tax credits influence inequality levels to any great extent. However, it should be kept in mind that the effect of tax allowances and tax credits is critically linked to the design of tax schedules. In particular, tax allowances and tax credits cannot, by design, have a significant impact in the context of low taxation levels. Tax allowances are progressive in a context of flat rate taxation but regressive in a progressive regime. Both tax allowances and tax credits affect inequality much less than means-tested and even non-contributory benefits. This reinforces the idea that the inequality-reducing capacity of fiscal benefits is limited.|$|R

40|$|The writer {{discusses}} {{the relation between}} the motor vehicle and total highway costs and presents a method of distributing this cost among motor vehicles in such a manner that each vehicle contributes directly in proportion to the amount of use which it makes of the highways. The underlying principle of the method is in the measurement of highway wear andtear in terms of impact force on the highway. From impact force, slightly modified by highway space occupied and a limited application of the 'ability to pay' canon of <b>taxation,</b> a <b>schedule</b> of relative ratios showing the proportional place that different vehicles should occupy in the scale of contributions is evolved. Using this schedule, actual figures of highway costs are taken to show how the method may be worked out into a compensating system of registration fees and gasoline taxes. The concluding chapters attempt to prove that competing systems of transportation - by rail and highway - should be dealt with as a co-ordinated unit...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} political incentives for {{redistribution of income}} and allocation policies in competitive democracies. In Chapter 2, I examine incentives for political redistribution through in-kind transfers. By analyzing the political game between office-motivated politicians and self-interested citizens, I first show that in economies with competitive markets in-kind transfers are not required. Politicians can win elections targeting groups of voters with differential cash transfers. However, in-kind transfers arise {{in the presence of}} externalities in consumption. In that case, targeting groups of voters with in-kind rather than cash transfers allows politicians to attract simultaneously voters in additional groups with the same amount of resources. Politicians undertake political redistribution depending on the expected electoral returns obtained from targeting both cash and in-kind transfers into different groups. Furthermore, electoral competition leads the economy to achieve Pareto efficient allocations that markets cannot reach. Politicians internalize the presence of external effects when competing for marginal voters who could swing their vote. In Chapter 3, this dissertation investigates the politicians' incentives to pursue income redistribution when governments are constrained to levy taxes on labor income and this creates distortions. Politicians who strive to be elected may strategically redistribute through in-kind rather than cash transfers and overprovide consumption of goods. I show that the overprovision of in-kind transfers reduces the disincentive effects of taxation in labor effort and enlarges the pool of resources for political redistribution. As a result, politicians are able to implement larger redistributive transfers and improve the well-being of swing voters. Hence, electoral competition for pivotal voters provides politicians incentives to implement redistributive schedules that reduce distortions in labor markets and improve the efficiency of the taxation system. In Chapter 4, I investigate the effect of ideological preferences over the public provision of goods on the scope of government and the political redistribution of income. I first point out that the presence of both ideological politicians who compete for office and electoral uncertainty generates a partisanship effect. In particular, I show that pro-market (right-wing) politicians commit to lower public provision of goods and <b>taxation</b> <b>schedules</b> that implement larger income inequality than pro-government (left-wing) politicians. Furthermore, I find out that the public funding of goods through income taxation confers an electoral advantage to pro-market ideological positions. In fact, pro-market politicians can court moderate pro-leftist voters by promises of higher income which pro-government politicians are not willing to fund completely. As a result, right-wing party exhibits larger chances of winning elections and its proposal supports lower ideological sacrifice than the left-wing party...|$|R
