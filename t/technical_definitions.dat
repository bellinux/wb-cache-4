2500|$|Stratified space: A [...] "stratified space" [...] is a {{space that}} {{can be divided into}} pieces ("strata"), with each stratum a manifold, with the strata fitting {{together}} in prescribed ways (formally, a filtration by closed subsets). There are various <b>technical</b> <b>definitions,</b> notably a Whitney stratified space (see Whitney conditions) for smooth manifolds and a topologically stratified space for topological manifolds. Basic examples include manifold with boundary (top dimensional manifold and codimension 1 boundary) and manifold with corners (top dimensional manifold, codimension 1 boundary, codimension 2 corners). Whitney stratified spaces are a broad class of spaces, including algebraic varieties, analytic varieties, semialgebraic sets, and subanalytic sets.|$|E

2500|$|A shutout must {{fall under}} the <b>technical</b> <b>definitions</b> of a {{complete}} game, which consists of only one pitcher pitching an entire game, regardless of how long the game lasts. However, the complete game stipulation is waived if the same pitcher records every out in the game without having technically started the game, as noted above with the game pitched by Ernie Shore. A standard Major League Baseball game consists of nine innings, unless weather or other uncontrollable elements prevent the game from being completed. If five or more innings have been played and the game cannot be resumed {{in a timely manner}} under normal conditions, it can be ruled as a [...] "complete game" [...] according to Major League Baseball rule 4.10. In this case, it is possible for a pitcher to complete only five innings pitched and still be credited with a complete-game shutout if the other team fails to score by the time the game is ended. However, no-hitter and perfect game bids are not official unless the game lasts at least nine innings. A shortened game cannot be considered a no-hitter or perfect game, but it can be counted as a shutout if applicable.|$|E

50|$|Besides the <b>technical</b> <b>definitions,</b> {{the styles}} of the {{different}} approaches are notable. Svatantrika style approaches have a more structured syllogistic form, making assertions with argumentation, whereas the Prasangika approach may make assertions, but with significantly less reasonings for those assertions. Instead they mainly point out errors resulting from taking reasonings to logical extremes.|$|E
