50|$|Before 1870 crane {{were fixed}} to a position, {{except for some}} mounted on flatcars, which {{provided}} some restricted movement. Appleby Brothers demonstrated steam-powered cranes at Paris in 1867 and Vienna in 1873. In 1922, Henry Coles, manager of Appleby Corp., began producing truck-mounted cranes under the name Petrol Electric Lorry Crane. In 1939 the Coles were acquired by Steel and Co. Ltd. of Sunderland. Hiab invented the world's first hydraulic <b>truck</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>crane</b> in 1947. The name, Hiab, comes from the commonly used abbreviation of Hydrauliska Industri AB, a company founded in Hudiksvall, Sweden 1944 by Eric Sundin, a ski manufacturer who saw a way to utilize a truck's engine to power loader cranes {{through the use of}} hydraulics.|$|E
50|$|A crane {{mounted on}} a truck carrier {{provides}} the mobility {{for this type of}} crane. This crane has two parts: the carrier, {{often referred to as the}} Lower, and the lifting component which includes the boom, referred to as the Upper. These are mated together through a turntable, allowing the upper to swing from side to side. These modern hydraulic truck cranes are usually single-engine machines, with the same engine powering the undercarriage and the crane. The upper is usually powered via hydraulics run through the turntable from the pump mounted on the lower. In older model designs of hydraulic truck cranes, there were two engines. One in the lower pulled the crane down the road and ran a hydraulic pump for the outriggers and jacks. The one in the upper ran the upper through a hydraulic pump of its own. Many older operators favor the two-engine system due to leaking seals in the turntable of aging newer design cranes.

5000|$|In 1969, John {{along with}} Paul Shockey started Condor Industries and began {{manufacturing}} self-propelled, telescoping hydraulic ariel 'cherry-picker' style lifts, {{primarily for the}} aircraft maintenance industry [...] In 1973, Condor Industries was renamed JLG Industries (JLG for John L. Grove). With innovative products and designs, such as mounting lifts on track-driven frames, locating the crane operators cab on the turret, less expensive <b>truck</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>cranes,</b> and 'scissors' lifts, JLG Industries had over 700 employees and 30 million in sales by the late 1970s.

Hiab invented the world's first hydraulic <b>truck</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>crane</b> in 1947. On {{the other side of the}} Bothnian Sea in Raisio, Finland about the same time, three brothers, Mikko, Mauno and Martti Terho developed a mechanical cable-operated interchangeable platform loader (Cablelift) that utilised the truck's front winch, with which it was possible to use a variety of platform bodies. In 1949 they started Multilift to manufacture their innovative load handling equipment. [...] The roots of today's Hiab Company lie in a series of acquisitions from 1977 onwards, when Partek Corporation embarked on a comprehensive diversification and internationalisation strategy. Founded in 1898, Partek Corporation was one of the oldest industrial companies in Finland, originally producing limestone and later a versatile range of materials for the construction industry. In 1977, Partek decided to expand into the engineering industry and thereby decrease its dependence on domestic construction when it first bought named Multilift. Eight years later, 1985 the company bought Hiab with its forestry crane subsidiary Jonsered. 1988 they bought Loglift, as the name applies, also a forestry crane manufacturer.|$|E
40|$|In this alert, NIOSH {{warned that}} crane {{operators}} and crew members may be electrocuted when working near overhead power lines. Five cases were described {{which resulted in}} six electrocutions. Case 1 involved a 29 year old who pushed the crane cable on a 1 yard cement bucket into a 7, 200 volt power line. Case 2 involved a 33 year old well driller who was electrocuted when a metal pipe lifted by a <b>truck</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>crane</b> contacted a 12, 000 volt overhead power line. The third case involved a 24 year old foreman for a telecommunications company who was electrocuted when he grabbed the door handle of a <b>truck</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>crane</b> whose boom was in contact with a 7, 200 volt overhead power line. Case 4 involved a 37 year old construction laborer electrocuted while pulling a wire rope attached to a crane cable toward a load. The fifth case involved a 20 year old male truck driver and his 70 year old male employer who were electrocuted when the boom of a <b>truck</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>crane</b> contacted a 7, 200 volt conductor of an overhead power line. Recommendations were made to train workers to comply with current regulations, to ensure that overhead power lines are deenergized or separated from the crane and its load, to designate a person to observe the clearance and give immediate warning when the crane approaches the limits of safe clearance, and not to use cage type boom guards, insulating links or proximity warning devices {{as a substitute for}} deenergizing and grounding lines or maintaining safe clearance.

40|$|Staff {{is proposing}} {{to address issues}} {{regarding}} two-engine on-road and off-road cranes by making both engines of two-engine cranes subject to the In-Use Off-Road Diesel Vehicle regulation and to remove the upper engines from the Portable ATCM regulation performance requirements. These issues facing the crane operators are related to safety and feasibility of repowering or retrofitting crane engines, and the complexity and unnecessary cost associated with complying with multiple regulations without any appreciable emission benefits. Two-engine cranes are defined as mobile diesel-powered machines with a hoisting mechanism mounted on a specially constructed truck chassis or carrier; one engine provides motive power, and a secondary engine is used to lift and move materials and objects. There are three general categories of two-engine cranes: lattice boom (conventional), all terrain or truck mounted. All terrain and <b>truck</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>crane</b> are very similar and can be categorized as truck mounted hydraulic cranes. The motive or drive engine is on-road engine. The secondary engine is off-road engine. B. Issues Concerns by crane operators regarding on-road cranes raised late during the off-road regulatory development process {{and could not be}} evaluated and workshopped in time to include them in the off-road regulation. The crane owners and operators requested that the two-engine cranes be included in the In-Use Off-Road Diesel Regulation...|$|E

30|$|Tree length {{harvesting}} {{systems are}} used in clearfall radiata pine plantations. Trees are felled with a feller-buncher, extracted to roadside landings with grapple or cable skidders, delimbed and processed into logs with a dangle-head processor on an excavator base. Logs are then sorted and stacked with a loading grapple on an excavator base, and loaded onto a truck with a <b>truck</b> <b>mounted</b> hydraulic <b>crane.</b> The size of the equipment used depends {{on the size of}} tree within the stands in which harvesting is taking place. Forestal Mininco classifies pine stands into four average tree size classes labelled A through D, with A having the biggest trees and D the smallest; over 0.9 m 3, 0.65 to 0.89 m 3, 0.4 to 0.64 m 3, and under 0.4 m 3. Waratah 620 processors working over Komatsu PC 200 excavators are typically used in Forest Classes C and D. Waratah 622 processors working over Komatsu PC 200 excavators or Waratah 622 B processors working over Komatsu PC 220 excavators are typically used in Forest Classes A and B. The forest class also determines the number of products (different diameter and lengths) cut, ranging from 8 to 10 for Forest Class A to 3 or 4 for Forest Class D.|$|R
40|$|Having a good {{understanding}} of the properties of a product for sale is important in every company, even more so in companies that produce products where certain properties can directly affect customer safety. The weight of load handling equipment is such a property. HIAB in Hudiksvall designs and manufactures <b>truck</b> <b>mounted</b> loader <b>cranes</b> in the mid-range segment. The final weight of such a crane will affect many things; it will affect the rated load of the crane since it is always lifting some part of itself during operation, it will affect the stability of the truck when lifting far away and, maybe the most important aspect, it will affect the maximum allowed load on the truck which has a direct impact on the customer’s profit. Determining the final weight of a crane has proven to be difficult. The weight on a drawing will lack several important features, such as paint, weld and oil, and it will not account for any variation in the raw material. This report describes the work on creating a process that allows the company to approximate the final weight of a crane before it is manufactured, something that can be delivered to the customer if demanded. The proposed process consists of regression analysis with the help of Tikhonov regularization. The regression model is built from measurements of already manufactured cranes along with information about which parts that were <b>mounted</b> on which <b>crane.</b> The model is then regularized with weights from drawings as starting values. The results from simulations show that it is possible for HIAB to use this model to predict the weight of a crane with a precision of about 1 %, as long as some drawings have their weight corrected.

50|$|Hot water {{extraction}} equipment {{may be a}} portable unit that plugs into an electrical outlet, or a <b>truck</b> <b>mount</b> carpet cleaner requiring long hoses from the truck or trailer. <b>Truck</b> <b>mounted</b> equipment may be used where electricity is unavailable (e.g. if electrical service was terminated). <b>Truck</b> <b>mount</b> carpet cleaning may be unsuited to premises distant from a driveway or road, and hoses may need to pass through windows to reach upper floors of a building. Hoses needed for <b>truck</b> <b>mount</b> and professional portable carpet cleaning may present an inconvenience or tripping hazard to users of hallways, and pets or children can escape through doors that must be left ajar for hoses. Heated or air conditioned air will also escape from buildings when doors are left open for hoses, potentially creating a significant waste of energy. <b>Truck</b> <b>mounted</b> carpet cleaning equipment minimizes noise in the room being cleaned, but may cause noise and air pollution offensive to neighbors, and may violate anti-idling bylaws in some jurisdictions. However, truck-mounted cleaning is much faster than portable equipment, and the extra heat will dissolve more spots and stains, and more vacuum suction power will reduce drying times.|$|R
