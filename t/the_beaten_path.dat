5000|$|The proem is a {{narrative}} sequence {{in which the}} narrator travels [...] "beyond <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> <b>paths</b> of mortal men" [...] to receive a revelation from an unnamed goddess (generally thought to be Persephone or Dikē) {{on the nature of}} reality. Aletheia, an estimated 90% of which has survived, and doxa, most of which no longer exists, are then presented as the spoken revelation of the goddess without any accompanying narrative.|$|R
60|$|In {{all this}} Phil was greatly {{assisted}} by his sister May, who, although {{not much more}} highly educated than himself, was quick of perception, of an inquiring mind, and a sympathetic soul. He was also somewhat assisted, and, at times, not a little retarded, by his ardent admirer Peter Pax, who joined him enthusiastically in his studies, but, being of a discursive and enterprising spirit, was prone to tempt him off <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> <b>paths</b> of learning into the thickets of speculative philosophy.|$|R

25|$|The game {{consists}} of multiple chapters, each consisting of several verses. Depending {{on how well}} the player performs, they are given {{one of the following}} medals {{at the end of the}} verse; Stone, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum and Pure Platinum, similar to the rating system of Viewtiful Joe. There are some medals that are earned off <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> <b>path,</b> such as special areas with set challenges. At the end of the chapter, a final score and an award is given depending on the type of medals achieved, with the score being deducted for any items used and deaths occurred. In between chapters there is a minigame called Angel Attack, in which players use Arcade Bullets found in the main levels to shoot at angels and earn points. These points can be traded in for items, with any leftover points exchanged for halos.|$|E

Hunt said that he did not intend for the song to have a meaning other than the explicit: [...] "I just thought it was funny.

[...] "It's a Mysterious Hustle" [...] features somber strings, a languid rhythm, an eerie piano vamp, and bitter singing by Hunt. It was recorded solely by Hunt, who played guitar, keyboards, and electronic drums. Its lyrics are about having to [...] "work your way through the crowd" [...] and [...] "overcome the place you come from", and view the world as [...] "no place to raise a child". Its spoken word conclusion preaches, [...] "If you follow <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> <b>path,</b> it will keep you tied to the past." ...|$|E

50|$|One of {{the many}} {{activities}} that can be enjoyed during the summer in Nancy Lake Recreational Area is fishing. Big and Little Noluck lakes are stocked with rainbow trout fry by the Department of Fish and Game. These lakes produce good catches of up to 14-inch fish. Many lakes and ponds in the Lynx Lake Loop have populations of northern pike. You can also fish in the smaller ponds and lakes not directly on the trails, and you can explore off <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> <b>paths</b> and find some great fishing. Such as the Lynx Lake Loop canoe an attraction that the area is well known for, the trail travels through an eight-mile chain of lakes. Other activities involve hiking and camping. Winter activities include ice fishing, skiing and dog musshing.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a methodology {{to analyze the}} spatial behavior of tourists based on tracking data. This method was applied during a field study {{in the city of}} Görlitz at the east border of Germany. Based on Global Positioning System (GPS) logs the spatial distribution of visitors in various areas is visualized and analyzed. Using the bimodality of the distribution of walking speeds, areas of slowdown are identified and subsequently clustered into activity areas. Using the activity areas, the amount of time tourists allocate to various activity categories is computed. Furthermore, a subsequent analysis of the activity behavior is used to identify the current visiting pattern of tourists and a network analysis of the identified activity areas is used to locate hubs. The network analysis highlights sequences of sights used very often and therefore identifies <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> <b>paths...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a practice}} that is nearly imperceptible to historians because the bulk of evidence for {{it is to be}} found in the interstices of <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> <b>paths</b> of legal and social history and because it mixes economic and religious matters in a strikingly unfamiliar manner. From the thirteenth to the sixteenth century, excommunication for debt offered ordinary people an economical, efficacious enforcement mechanism for small-scale, daily, unwritten credit. At the same time, the practice offered holders of ecclesiastical jurisdiction an important opportunity to round out their incomes, particularly in the difficult fifteenth century. This transitional practice reveals a level of credit below that of the letters of change, annuities secured on real property, or written obligations beloved of economic historians and historians of banking. Studying the practice casts light on the transition from the face-to-face, local economies of the high Middle Ages to the regional economies of the early modern period, on how the Reformation shaped early modern regimes of credit, and on how the disappearance of ecclesiastical civil justice facilitated the emergence of early modern juridically sovereign territories...|$|R

The park itself {{has its roots in the}} time when many German leisure parks were being established, and began, like others, with the fairytale forest.

Now they were his own. They had, in fact, been his own from the first. The heart of this country-bred girl had fallen at the first word from his mouth. Had she not so confessed to him? She was very nice--very nice indeed. He loved her dearly. But had he not sold himself too cheaply? ...|$|R
