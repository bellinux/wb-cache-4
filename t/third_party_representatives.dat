While there continues to be an increasing amount of literature on the mechanics and strategies of negotiation, the underlying interests that are typically at stake in representative negotiations from the perspective of representatives - particularly negotiations involving lawyers - have not been adequately studied. Current accounts of the representative negotiator do not paint a full picture of what is typically going on inside the representative 2 ̆ 7 s mind, and as such, provide an impoverished view of his or her role, both in terms of its responsibilities and its potential opportunities. To address these deficiencies, this article advances an alternative, expansive model of the representative negotiator: the negotiator-as-professional model. It is a model that sees the role of the representative negotiator as being defined by at least four sets of interests: client interests, a broad understanding of the representative 2 ̆ 7 s self-interests (that may include, but are not limited to, interests vis-a-vis the representative negotiator 2 ̆ 7 s bargaining opposite), ethical interests and the public 2 ̆ 7 s interests...|$|E

50|$|The {{principal}} {{difference between}} a void and voidable marriage is that, {{in the case of}} the former, because it is invalid from the beginning, it can be voided ex-officio; while {{in the case of the}} latter it is only the spouse himself/herself who can ask for an annulment (in some cases such as if the spouse is a minor or mentally disabled a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>representative</b> such as a parent, legal guardian or child protective service can start an annulment acting as the legal representative of said spouse). These differences are very relevant, because they represent the official policy on issues such as forced marriage for instance: if such marriage is classified legally as void - then the state can cancel it even against the will of the spouses; if it is voidable - then the state cannot act in the absence of an application by a spouse even if the state knows the marriage is forced.|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims at {{understanding}} {{the content and}} potential societal impact of governmental voluntary sustainable development program through a case entity "The Finland we want by 2050 - Society's commitment to sustainable development", focusing on business participants. Existing literature has focused mostly on evaluating issue or industry specific voluntary environmental or social programs. However, all-encompassing governmental voluntary programs that are open for all societal actors and cover all sustainability aspects are a new phenomenon that set a new ground for research. The research is an evaluative single case study that combines both qualitative and quantitative data and analysis methods. The primary data is collected from the program's database containing 170 individual commitments out of which 42 were company commitments. The research is complemented by official documents and interviews with three company representatives, two representatives of the FNCSD and one <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>representative.</b> Individual operative commitments were analysed using an evaluation matrix. The findings in the study {{points out that the}} program is most likely to cause positive impact on society. However, due to insufficient information provided by the participants, the absolute impact couldn't be measured. Majority of the participants used internally measurable indicators that could not be used for evaluating societal impact. This lead to suggestion that voluntary programs should have better indicators in order to measure societal impact. The study also showed that one third of the commitments did not have any impact through the program. This was caused by two types of commitments: those that existed before the participant joined the program and those that pledged to carry on business-as-usual activities as their commitment. In addition, the participants interpreted some of the program criteria and objectives differently. This caused variation in quality and difficulties for evaluating the impact of the program. The suggestion is that criteria for participants should be clearer in order to avoid openness for interpretation. The commitment 2050 proved capabilities in attracting SMEs to take public CSR actions instead of only including large companies that are traditionally more visible in CSR. Nevertheless, the commitment program attracted mostly companies that were already active in the field of CSR or sustainable development...|$|R

Shared <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> signal insider status and have a predictable positive effect on knowledge transfer.

40|$|This article {{systematically}} {{examines the}} varying effectiveness of African and non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> in mediating civil wars in Africa. Drawing {{on data from}} the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, supplemented with unique data on mediation efforts, which together cover all mediation efforts in civil wars in Africa between 1960 and 2012, this article presents quantitative evidence supporting the effectiveness of African <b>third</b> <b>parties.</b> Compared to non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> {{are far more likely}} to conclude peace agreements and these peace agreements are more likely to be durable.

Indeed, whilst African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> should take the lead in mediation processes in African civil wars, non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> should support these processes by lending additional strength.

40|$|How is two-party electoral {{competition}} {{influenced by}} <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> even under normal political conditions? I {{argue that the}} mere threat of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> entry into the election induces anticipatory electoral strategies by the major parties. This effect, which is a normal aspect of the two-party system, is how <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> play a consistent role in U. S. elections. The ability for <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> to influence the major parties is moderated by electoral institutions. The ballot access requirement, {{in the form of}} a signature requirement, varies widely across House elections and is a significant predictor of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> electoral success. Consistent with conventional wisdom, I find that it has a negative effect on the likelihood of entry. Notably, the requirement also has a positive effect on <b>third</b> <b>party</b> vote shares, conditional on successful petitioning, due to a screening and quality effect. I explore the effects of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat in unidimensional and multidimensional settings. A formal model of elections predicts that the threat of entry induces major party divergence in a unidimensional ideological space. The major parties diverge in anticipation of potential <b>third</b> <b>party</b> entry. An empirical analysis of candidate positioning in the 1996 U. S. House elections finds support of this hypothesis. Data on major party campaign advertising in the 2000 to 2004 U. S. House elections are used to assess <b>third</b> <b>party</b> effects in a multidimensional framework. I show that <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat influences the scope and content of campaign advertising. Major party candidates, particularly incumbents, discuss a broader range of issues when <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat is higher. I use the case of environmental issues and the Green party to assess the influence of <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> on issue-specific content. I find that Green party threat leads to predictable differences between Democratic and Republican advertising on environmental issues. In sum, <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> play a consistent role in U. S. House elections by inducing anticipatory strategies by the major parties. This strategic framework for understanding <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> stresses two things. First, one should focus on the major parties in order to gauge the influence of <b>third</b> <b>parties.</b> Second, one should not conclude that <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> are irrelevant because of their minimal electoral success. <b>Third</b> <b>party</b> effects are in fact present even in elections where a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> does not enter.

50|$|If {{an agent}} does not {{disclose}} to a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> {{that he is}} acting as agent, and concludes {{a contract with the}} <b>third</b> <b>party</b> {{as if he were the}} principal in the transaction, the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> may treat the contract as binding on the agent. The <b>third</b> <b>party</b> may sue the agent, as principal, on the contract; equally the agent may, as principal, sue the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> on the contract. When, however, the undisclosed principal discovers that the contract that he in fact authorised has been concluded, he may adopt it, and may consequently sue the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> on it. Equally, the <b>third</b> <b>party,</b> on discovering the undisclosed principal, may sue the principal on the contract. it follows that the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> has a choice or an election to sue either the agent or the undisclosed principal, when discovered; but having elected to sue one of them the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> is debarred from suing the other, even if he or she sues the agent before being aware that there is a principal.

Some of the companies are less competent than others in terms of the services they offer in each of the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> logistics service categories.
