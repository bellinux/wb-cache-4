The three agricultural products with the greatest amount of <b>trade</b> <b>distortion</b> were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the oilseeds, sesame had the greatest amount of taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy. Despite this progress, certain crops, such as cotton, still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices, causing hardship in developing countries with non-subsidized farmers. Unprocessed commodities (i.e. corn, soybeans, cows) are generally graded to indicate quality. The quality affects the price the producer receives. Commodities are generally reported by production quantities, such as volume, number or weight.|$|E

40|$|The current {{round of}} {{negotiations}} of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) represents a major initiative of economic reform. Initiatives for trade reform are far from new. A facilitative framework has been proposed that ranks policies according to their level of price distortionâ€”the least distorting policies are favored over the more distorting. Policies that are regarded as highly distortionary are termed "red light policies"; those policies that are least distortionary and, therefore, most acceptable from an international prospective are "green light policies"; "yellow light policies" fall between these two extremes. This policy ranking scheme, at least in theory, {{is based on the}} degree of <b>trade</b> <b>distortion</b> each policy creates (Rausser and Nielson, 1990). In addition to the degree of <b>trade</b> <b>distortion,</b> the political sustainability of the reform policy should influence the ranking (Rausser and Irwin) 1989); a reform policy that is likely to be sustainable is more desirable than an equally distortionary policy that {{is not likely to be}} sustainable. We show that policies that promote diversification of ownership and mobility of the factors of production can reduce the incentive of agents to seek protectionist trade policies. Therefore, we argue that all use the same policies that promote the mobility of factors, and the diversification of ownership of immobile factors should be ranked above those that do not. ...|$|E

40|$|What is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) ? The GATT {{may be best}} {{described}} as an ongoing process through which <b>trade</b> <b>distortions</b> among countries are defined and targeted for reduction. There have been seven previous GATT agreements over the years. The most recent GATT agreement represents the eighth round of trade negotiations and is often called the Uruguay Round in reference to Punta del Este, Uruguay, where the agenda was set in 1986. The Uruguay Round of trade negotiations {{was the first to}} focus directly on <b>trade</b> <b>distortions</b> in agriculture. Agricultural <b>trade</b> <b>distortions</b> were chosen primarily because of increasing budgetary constraints for agricultural programs around the world. An agreement from the Uruguay Round was finally reached in December 1993, after seven years of negotiations that involved 117 nations. Even though an agreement was reached, the U. S. Congress still has to approve the agreement for it to become U. S. law. With the agreement slated to take effect on July 1, 1995, the lawmakers will have to move rather quickly to pass implementing legislation if the GATT agreement is to be approved in its present form. It does not appear that GATT implementing legislation will be passed this fall. If GATT is not approved by Congress in the spring of 195, many of the agreements will have to be renegotiated. ...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{substantial}} government support, Norway {{is more or less}} self-sufficient in its main agricultural products. This contributes to both <b>trade</b> <b>distortions</b> and higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In multinational negotiations separate efforts are being made to liberalize trade (through the World Trade Organization) and to reduce global GHG emissions (through the United Nations). Using a model of Norwegian agriculture, we explore interconnections between trade liberalization and GHG emission reductions. We show that the Doha proposals would involve no major cut in either agricultural production or GHG emissions due to weakness in the disciplines on trade distorting support. We contrast further trade liberalization and the use of a carbon tax to achieve emission reductions. Trade liberalization involves relatively large impacts on agricultural activity. <b>Trade</b> <b>distortions</b> decrease, and, economic welfare increases substantially due to lower production. For a high cost country like Norway, this indicates that the GHG abatement cost is negative in the sector if no value is attributed to agricultural activity beyond the world market price of food. A more targeted policy to reduce GHG emissions is to use a carbon tax. Compared to the trade liberalization case, both production and land use can be kept at a higher level with only a modest decrease in economic welfare. The side-effect is, however, higher <b>trade</b> <b>distortions.</b> Agricultural and Food Policy, Environmental Economics and Policy, International Relations/Trade, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a two-country, two-sector model {{of international trade}} with increasing returns to scale in one sector. Free trade leads to asymmetric equilibria even when both countries are identical with respect to technology, tastes and factor endowments. For some parameter values, trade leads to a uniform welfare improvement in both countries, while for others it can give rise to uneven development {{in the sense of}} persistent disparities in wages, income and welfare. In the latter case, distortionary industrial policy by the less developed country may be welfare enhancing. If the dynamics of policy changes are endogenized, the model gives rise to periodic changes in industrial leadership or leapfrogging.

40|$|Agricultural {{markets in}} Mexico, as elsewhere, are {{distorted}} by domestic subsidies {{as well as}} international trade policies. To measure domestic distortions in agriculture and compare them internationally, analysts have used"producer subsidy equivalent"(a production-share weighted average of producer subsidies) and"consumer subsidy equivalent"indices, {{as well as the}} familiar trade-weighted averages of tariffs and tariff equivalents of quotas. All these indices lack a theoretical foundation, as is well-known. Moreover, {{in the absence of a}} connection between the three partial indices of consumption, production, and <b>trade</b> <b>distortion,</b> inferences about the trade restrictiveness of all three policies are illegitimate.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade the {{developing}} countries have tried much harder to achieve macroeconomic stability than they have to eliminate inefficiencies from microeconomic distortions. The author has pursued a relatively new line of inquiry in examining measurement of the social income losses induced by {{the reduction of the}} investment efficiency caused by <b>trade</b> <b>distortions.</b> Empirical findings of the study suggest a strong negative effect of <b>trade</b> <b>distortions</b> on the social efficiency of investment. The social income losses caused by the reduced investment efficiency are considerable. Countries that have a moderate investment ratio (about 20 percent of GDP) can experience social income losses in excess of 18 percent in 30 years, if tariffs are about 50 percent. This study confirms earlier findings about the relatively modest efficiency losses caused by the independent effects of specific distortions.
