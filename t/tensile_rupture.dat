It shows that the explanation regarding the feasible mechanism of block shear failures previously provided by the first author does not necessarily apply to staggered bolted connections, in which the downstream bolts {{do not have the}} same edge distance. For staggered bolted connections, a block shear failure may occur through the shear <b>rupture</b> and <b>tensile</b> yielding mechanism for particular configurations, as demonstrated for the first time in this paper.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the mechanisms for block shear failures of bolted connections in steel plates postulated {{in the design}} equations specified in the North American, European and Australian steel structures codes.

40|$|In this research, 12 {{reinforced}} concrete (RC) beams, comprising two beams as control beams, and 10 beams strengthened with fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP), {{were tested in}} a four-point bending configuration to determine the ability of externally bonded composite fabrics to improve the flexural capacity of a beam. The composite fabrics used were made of glass and carbon fibre. The fabrics were bonded to the RC beams using a two-part epoxy. These two fabrics were chosen to allow a variety of fabric strengths to be studied. The external bonded reinforcement (EBR) led to an average 240 per cent increase in flexural capacity. Different end anchorages and application configurations of the externally bonded glass and carbon fibres were evaluated to assess their effectiveness in minimising or preventing the debonding of these externally applied composite materials. The {{results indicate that the}} anchorages effectively prevented the debonding of the FRP laminates during flexural testing. Beams that were reinforced with glass fabric but without end anchorages failed, with <b>tensile</b> <b>rupture</b> of the FRP followed by debonding. Beams that were externally bonded with anchorages escaped debonding, instead suffering concrete crushing of the compression zone at mid-span as well as <b>tensile</b> <b>rupture</b> of the composite fabrics.

Higher strength to weight ratios and increased corrosion resistance are the primary advantages of a composite material for this application. The current study focuses on the life prediction of a PPS/AS- 4 carbon fiber composite proposed for the above employment. In order to accomplish this task, {{the properties of the}} material were experimentally characterized at varying temperatures, aging times and loadings. An analytic technique was developed to predict <b>tensile</b> <b>rupture</b> behavior from bend-compression rupture data. In comparison to <b>tensile</b> <b>rupture</b> tests, bend-compression rupture data collection are uncomplicated and efficient; thus, this technique effectively simplifies and accelerates the material characterization process. The service life model for the flexible pipe composite armor was constructed with MRLife, a well established performance simulation code for material systems developed by the Materials Response Group at Virginia Tech. In order to validate MRLife for the current material, experimental data are compared to life prediction results produced by the code. MRLife was then applied to predict the life of the flexible pipe composite armor in an ocean environment.

Simulated engine exposures for 1000 hours at 899 C or 982 C in a jet fuel burner rig with cyclic air cooling were studied, as were the effects of surface machining before coating and re-machining and re-coating after exposures.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{and compares}} the two loading systems and their associated energy and basic stress fields in elastic crustal rock mass {{for the cause}} of tectonic earthquakes. The first loading system is an external loading system and associated with the conventional earthquake cause hypothesis of active fault elastic rebounding. The second is a combined loading system where the first external loading system is added with a dense gas loading in the interior of deep crustal rock faults/defects. It is associated with the methane gas hypothesis {{for the cause of}} tectonic earthquakes. Five elastic stresses in rock solids with some idealized faults and caverns are presented to illustrate the similarities and differences of the stress fields and the possible rupture failure modes in association of the two loading systems. The theoretical results can show that any changes in the local stress concentrations due the external loading alone can be reflected and noticed in the corresponding stresses at the far field. On the other hand, any changes in the local stress concentrations due to the internal gas loading cannot be observed and distinguished in the tectonic stress field at the far distance. These theoretical results can be used to well explain the consensus of earthquake unpredictability with present technology. The theoretical results can further show that the external tectonic loading alone can only cause shear ruptures in crustal fault rocks with high compressive stresses, and such shear rupture or frictional failure is also difficult to occur because its shear plane has extremely high compressive normal stress. The combined loading can cause not only shear <b>ruptures,</b> but also <b>tensile</b> <b>ruptures</b> in crustal fault rocks, and such shear and <b>tensile</b> <b>ruptures</b> occur much easier since the rupture plane can have very low compressive or even high-tensile normal stress. It is argued that the earthquake energy is the volumetric expansion energy of dense gas mass escaped from the deep traps along crustal rock faults. The migration and expansion of the escaped dense gas mass in the crustal rock faults and defects cause the seismic body waves, the ground sounding, the seismic surface waves, the ground co-seismic ruptures and damages. Its rapid migration and expansion in thick water cause tsunamis in lakes and oceans. Its rapid migration and expansion in the atmosphere cause the sky to become cloudy. The dense methane gas is produced every day in the mantle and core of the Earth, migrates outward and accumulates and stores beneath the lower crustal rock in high compression. It forms a thin spherical layer of dense methane gas separating the cold crustal rocks and the hot mantle materials. Its leaking along deep faults or plate boundaries causes earthquakes and supplies to shallow gas and oil reservoirs beneath secondary traps in adjacent basins of the upper crustal rock mass. postprin...|$|R

40|$|The quasistatic {{behavior}} of a simple 2 D model of a cohesive powder under isotropic loads is investigated by Discrete Element simulations. The loose packing states, as studied in a previous paper, undergo important structural changes under growing confining pressure P, while solid fraction Φ irreversibly increases by large amounts. The system state goes through three stages, with different forms of the plastic consolidation curve Φ(P*), under growing reduced pressure P* = Pa/F 0, defined with adhesion force F 0 and grain diameter a. In the low-confinement regime (I), plastic compaction is negligible, and the structure {{is influenced by the}} assembling process. The following stage (regime II) is independent of initial conditions. The void ratio varies linearly with log P, as described in the engineering literature. In the last stage of compaction (III), a maximum solid fraction is approached, and properties of cohesionless granular packs are retrieved. Under consolidation, while the fractal range of density correlations decreases, force patterns reorganize, and elastic moduli increase by a large factor. Plastic deformation events correspond to very small changes in the network topology, while the denser regions tend to move like rigid bodies. Elastic properties are dominated by the bending of thin junctions in loose systems. For growing RR those tend to reduce to particle chains, the folding of which, rather than <b>tensile</b> <b>ruptures,</b> controls plastic compaction...|$|R
