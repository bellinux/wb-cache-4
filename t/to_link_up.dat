The Italians were expected to commence offensive action by attacking southwards <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the 14th Panzer Division {{in the vicinity of}} Karlovac.|$|E
5|$|About 23:00, German 2nd Army {{headquarters}} {{directed the}} 14th Panzer Division to penetrate past Zagreb towards Karlovac <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the Italian 2nd Army, and also directed the 8th Panzer Division and 16th Motorised Infantry Division {{to drive to}} the north of Belgrade <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the First Panzer Group which was thrusting towards Belgrade from the east. At midnight, 2nd Army headquarters declared that the Yugoslav northern front had been decisively defeated, and tasked corps engineer units to consolidate bridging across major rivers, particularly over the Sava at Brežice west of Zagreb to facilitate the advance of the 14th Panzer Division towards Karlovac. The main body units of the XLVI Motorised Corps moved forward to Virovitica and Slatina, and 2nd Army headquarters moved forward to establish itself in Maribor, protected by the 538th Frontier Guard Division. At midnight, General der Panzertruppe Heinrich von Vietinghoff issued orders for the 8th Panzer Division to continue towards Belgrade via Osijek, but directed the 16th Motorised Infantry Division to thrust west as far as Sremska Mitrovica then turn south to drive towards Sarajevo via Zvornik.|$|E

Some of the other battalions that participated in the battle also incurred heavy losses. Elliott managed <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with elements of the 21st Battalion, the commander of which recommended him for the VC. Elliott was evacuated to hospital where he spent three months recovering from his various wounds before {{he returned to his}} battalion in September.|$|E

50|$|Pendulum Progress was the {{successor}} {{of the original}} Pendulum series. There are three in total; the Pendulum Progress is an upgrade similar to the Tamagotchi Connection. The character lineup on each is expanded and it retains the pendulum feature that became a series standard; {{it also has the}} ability to have the current monster fight a computer monster in battle as opposed <b>to</b> <b>linking</b> <b>up</b> with another device.|$|R
5|$|The French 7th Army, on the {{northern}} flank of the Belgian line, protected the Bruges–Ghent–Ostend axis and, covering the Channel ports, had advanced into Belgium and into the Netherlands with speed. It reached Breda in the Netherlands, on 11 May. But German parachute forces had seized the Moerdijk bridge on the Hollands Diep river, south of Rotterdam, {{making it impossible for}} the French <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the Dutch Army. The Dutch Army withdrew north to Rotterdam and Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|After their {{defeat the}} Royalists {{effectively}} abandoned Northern England, losing {{much of the}} manpower from the northern counties of England (which were strongly Royalist in sympathy) and also losing access to the European continent through the ports on the North Sea coast. Although they partially retrieved their fortunes with victories {{later in the year}} in Southern England, the loss of the north was to prove a fatal handicap the next year, when they tried unsuccessfully <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the Scottish Royalists under the Marquess of Montrose.|$|E
5|$|Between 24 April and 1 May, the IX Army {{fought a}} desperate action {{to break out}} of the pocket in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the XII Army. Hitler assumed that after a {{successful}} breakout from the pocket, the IX Army could combine forces with the XII Army and would be able to relieve Berlin. There is no evidence to suggest that Generals Heinrici, Busse, or Wenck thought that this was even remotely strategically feasible, but Hitler's agreement to allow the IX Army to break through Soviet lines allowed many German soldiers to escape to the west and surrender to the United States Army.|$|E

5|$|During their {{fighting}} retreat up the Rhône, the Germans also withdrew {{their remaining}} forces from their garrisons in south-western France. These divisions raced {{north along the}} Atlantic coast and then swung towards the east at the Loire <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>up</b> {{with the rest of}} Army GroupG at Burgundy. While {{they did not have to}} fight the Western Allies as much as the Germans had done at the Rhône, they still had to advance through French partisan-dominated terrain. About 88,000 men moved north, leaving 20,000 in south-western France behind. During the retreat, about 19,000 men were captured by the Allies and 60,000 men reached Army GroupG's line, where they were integrated into the defense of the Vosges mountains.|$|E
5|$|Egypt {{invaded the}} newly {{declared}} State of Israel on May 15, 1948. Their strength was approximately one division, commanded by Major General Ahmed Ali al-Mwawi. Their advance was three-pronged: The main column moved north through what is today the Gaza Strip and attacked Kfar Darom, another column went east toward Beersheba, {{and a third}} attacked kibbutz Nirim. On May 17, a small force split off from Beersheba <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with more Egyptian forces at Auja al-Hafir, on May 19 the main column attacked Yad Mordechai, and on May 20, the main force in Beersheba set out to link with the Jordanian Arab Legion in Hebron.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944 it {{joined the}} élite British Special Air Service (SAS) Brigade and was renamed the 5th SAS Regiment in March, {{even though it}} was only battalion-strength. The 5th SAS was {{deployed}} on numerous missions behind enemy lines. In July 1944, the small groups from 5th SAS were dropped by parachute into northern France to perform reconnaissance and sabotage missions and <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the French Resistance. Amongst their missions was to harass the German retreat from the Falaise Gap.|$|E
50|$|The voyage {{took several}} months in rough seas, with {{difficulty}} obtaining coal for refuelling - as the warships could not legally enter the ports of neutral nations - and {{the morale of the}} crews plummeted. The Russians had been ordered to break the blockade of Port Arthur, but the city had already fallen (on 2 January) by the time they arrived in the Far East. The objective was therefore shifted <b>to</b> <b>linking</b> <b>up</b> with the remaining Russian ships stationed in the port of Vladivostok, before bringing the Japanese fleet to battle.|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} on Wednesday, May 31, 2017 that Picamoles would leave Northampton despite still having two seasons {{left on his}} contract <b>to</b> <b>link</b> back <b>up</b> with former club Montpellier Hérault RC who paid Saints a substantial transfer fee for the France international.|$|R

5|$|In outline, the XV Mountain Corps {{plan was}} for a heavy aerial {{bombardment}} of Partisan positions in and around Drvar by Luftwaffe aircraft, followed by a parachute and glider assault by the 500th SS Parachute Battalion who had the task of capturing or killing Tito and destroying his headquarters. The assault also included tasks to capture or destroy the Allied military missions to the Partisans. On the same day, ground elements of XV Mountain Corps were to converge on Drvar <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the 500th SS Parachute Battalion. A small reconnaissance aircraft was tasked to fly into Drvar after its capture to retrieve Tito or his body.|$|E
5|$|On 21 March 1918, the Germans {{began their}} Spring Offensive and the New Zealand Division {{was rushed to}} plug {{a gap in the}} front near Colincamps. On 27 March, Puttick was wounded in the chest while leading his {{battalion}} in an action designed <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with an Australian brigade in the nearby village of Hébuterne. He was evacuated to England for treatment and after recuperating, commanded the New Zealand Rifle Brigade's training camp in Brocton, Staffordshire.

5|$|Strachwitz led an ad-hoc {{formation}} in Operation Doppelkopf (double-head) {{as part of}} Dietrich von Saucken's XXXIX Panzer Corps counter-offensive following the major Soviet advance in Operation Bagration. Von Saucken's goal was to relieve the encircled forces in the Courland Pocket. Strachwitz's attack on 18 August 1944 was preceded by a heavy artillery bombardment from the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen; forces inside the pocket attacked <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with Strachwitz's force. His troops reached the 16. Armee at Tukums by midday.|$|E
5|$|Tallard's march {{presented}} a dilemma for Eugene. If the Allies {{were not to}} be outnumbered on the Danube, Eugene realised he must either try to cut Tallard off before he could get there or he must hasten to reinforce Marlborough. if he withdrew from the Rhine to the Danube, Villeroi might also make a move south <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the Elector and Marsin. Eugene compromised: leaving 12,000 troops behind guarding the Lines of Stollhofen, he marched off {{with the rest of his}} army to forestall Tallard.|$|E

The French squadron had sailed from the port of Lorient on 23 February in an effort <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with a fleet from Brest under Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, but missed the rendezvous and was pursued by a British blockade squadron under Rear-Admiral Robert Stopford. The French commander, Commodore Pierre Roch Jurien, anchored his squadron under the batteries which protected the town of Les Sables-d'Olonne {{in the hope of}} dissuading an attack.|$|E
5|$|The Belgians and French {{remained}} {{confused about}} {{what was expected of}} each other if or when, hostilities commenced. The Belgians were determined to hold the border fortifications along the Albert Canal and the Meuse, without withdrawing, until the French Army arrived to support them. Gamelin was not keen on pushing his Dyle plan that far. He was concerned that the Belgians would be driven out of their defences and would retreat to Antwerp, as in 1914. In fact, the Belgian divisions protecting the border were to withdraw and retreat southward <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with French forces. This information was not given to Gamelin.|$|E
5|$|The Red Army {{allocated}} {{an estimated}} 1,100,000 personnel, 804 tanks, 13,400 artillery pieces and over 1,000 aircraft {{for the upcoming}} offensive. Across the Third Romanian Army, the Soviets placed the redeployed 5th Tank Army, {{as well as the}} 21st and 65th Armies, in order to penetrate and overrun the German flanks. The German southern flank was targeted by the Stalingrad Front's 51st and 57th Armies, led by the 13th and 4th Mechanized Corps; these would punch through the Fourth Romanian Army, in order <b>to</b> <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the 5th Tank Army near the town of Kalach.
