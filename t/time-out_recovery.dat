40|$|This paper {{presents}} a discrete-time Markov chain {{model for the}} Reno version of TCP, the transmission control protocol for reliable transport on the Internet. The purpose is the evaluation of stationary TCP flows behavior using performance measures such as the mean throughput. The model is based on previous works which are generalized by {{taking into account the}} slow start phases that appear after each <b>time-out</b> <b>recovery.</b> We consider the three different phases of the protocol : time-out, slow start and congestion avoidance and we obtain analytical expressions for the mean number of segments sent during each of these phases and their mean duration. Our model also allows us to evaluate the proportion of losses due to the timer expiry and the duplicate acknowledgments...|$|E
40|$|Designing {{software}} architectures {{to facilitate}} accessible Web applications The Web application is increasingly {{a platform of}} choice for complex business software and online services. However, it remains a challenge {{to ensure that the}} Web application is easy, efficient, and effective for people with disabilities. Accessibility requires that users with disabilities, including those who are blind, have low vision, or have mobility impairments, are able to use the applications effectively and with a reasonable amount of effort. Although there has been important progress in recent years in describing the relationship between architecture and usability, the topic of architectural support for accessibility has not been adequately addressed. Based on our experience in designing Web applications for the United States Social Security Administration, we have begun to identify guidelines for architectures that support accessibility. This paper describes common accessibility problems encountered in Web applications and explains how architecture can help address these problems through reusable accessible objects, supplementing information in links, buttons, and labels, assisting in access to Web page visual information, handling errors, and providing <b>time-out</b> notification and <b>recovery.</b> It also discusses the critical role of architecture in supporting the best way of meeting the needs of diverse user groups: multiple dynamic views of the user interface...|$|R
