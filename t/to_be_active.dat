40|$|Obese {{children}} <b>are</b> usually less <b>active</b> {{than their}} normal-weight counterparts, although {{the reasons for}} this remain unclear. The objective of the present study <b>was</b> <b>to</b> determine how a long-term program (3 years of intervention and 6 months of follow-up detraining) of physical exercise with or without a low calorie diet influenced sedentary obese children’s intention <b>to</b> <b>be</b> physically <b>active.</b> The participants <b>were</b> 27 children, ages from 8 to 11 years, who formed two groups according to the program that they followed. One group followed an exercise program (three 90 -min sessions per week), and the other this same exercise program together with a hypocaloric diet. The intention <b>to</b> <b>be</b> physically <b>active</b> <b>was</b> assessed via the Measurement of Intention <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Physically <b>Active</b> (MIFA) questionnaire. The subjects’ scores at different times of the program (baseline, Year 3, and detraining) were compared using a repeated-measures ANOVA, and a post-hoc Tukey’s test <b>was</b> applied <b>to</b> confirm the differences. After both the intervention and detraining, both groups showed greater intention <b>to</b> <b>be</b> physically <b>active.</b> This suggests the suitability of long-term physical exercise to generate greater intention <b>to</b> <b>be</b> physically <b>active</b> and thus establish healthy life habits including increased levels of physical activity...|$|R

5|$|Most microbats are nocturnal while megabats are {{typically}} diurnal or crepuscular. In temperate areas, bats may migrate hundreds of kilometres to winter hibernation dens, while some pass into torpor in cold weather, rousing and feeding when warm weather allows for insects <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>active.</b> Others retreat to caves for winter and hibernate for six months. Microbats rarely fly in rain, it interferes with their echolocation, {{and they are}} unable to locate their food. A few species such as the New Zealand short-tailed bat and the common vampire bat are agile on the ground.|$|E

40|$|Purpose : Although {{physical}} activity and exercise for stroke patients is highly recommended for fast recovery, patients in hospitals and rehabilitation centres <b>are</b> insufficiently encouraged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> physically <b>active.</b> In this study, we investigated the impact of knowledge brokers (KBs), enterprising nurses and therapists, on health professionals’ (HP) performance to encourage stroke inpatients <b>to</b> <b>be</b> physically <b>active.</b>   Method : This multicenter intervention study used a pre–post test design. Two or three KBs were trained in each stroke unit of 12 hospitals and 10 rehabilitation centres in The Netherlands. Questionnaires were completed by patients and HPs {{before and after the}} KB-intervention. The primary outcome was encouragement given by HPs to their patients <b>to</b> <b>be</b> physically <b>active,</b> as reported by patients and HPs.   Results : After the KB-intervention, many more patients (48 %; N= 217) reported at least some encouragement by HPs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> physically <b>active</b> than before (26 %; N= 243, p< 0. 000). HPs (N= 288) on an average reported encouraging patients more often after the intervention, but this difference was significant only for occupational therapists and KBs.   Conclusions : Based on patient’s reports of HP behaviour, the KB-intervention appears effective since more patients felt encouraged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> physically <b>active</b> after the intervention compared to before. Replication of this study in an experimental design <b>is</b> needed <b>to</b> allow causal inferences. Implications for rehabilitation We advise rehabilitation teams to make use of knowledge brokers (KBs), since the KB-intervention <b>was</b> shown <b>to</b> increase the encouragement felt by stroke patients <b>to</b> <b>be</b> physically <b>active.</b> It seems worthwhile to involve physicians, nurses and patients’ families more frequently in efforts to encourage stroke patients <b>to</b> <b>be</b> physically <b>active...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. First, the father's semen curdles the mother's menses, which Aristotle compares with how rennet (an enzyme from a cow's stomach) curdles milk in cheesemaking.

The pneuma first makes the heart appear; this is vital, as the heart nourishes all other organs.
