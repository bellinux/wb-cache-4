50|$|In {{parallel}} to stock trading, {{starting at the}} end of the 1990s, a number of new Market Maker firms provide foreign exchange and derivative day trading through new electronic trading platforms. These allowed day traders to have instant access to decentralised markets such as forex and global markets through derivatives such as contracts for difference. Most of these firms were based in the UK and later in less restrictive jurisdiction, this was in part due to the regulations in the US prohibiting this type of over-the-counter trading. These firms typically provide <b>trading</b> <b>on</b> <b>margin</b> allowing day traders to take large position with relatively small capital, but with the associated increase in risk. Retail forex trading became a popular way to day trade due to its liquidity and the 24-hour nature of the market.|$|E
5000|$|Items {{traded in}} an {{economic}} bubble {{are much more likely}} to have an intrinsic value that is worth a substantial proportion of the market price. Therefore, following collapse of an economic bubble (especially one in a commodity such as real estate) the items affected will often retain some value, whereas an investment that is part of a Ponzi scheme will typically be worthless (or very close to worthless). On the other hand, it is much easier to obtain financing for many items that are the frequent subject of bubbles. If an investor <b>trading</b> <b>on</b> <b>margin</b> or borrowing to finance investments becomes the victim of a bubble, he or she can still lose all (or a very substantial portion) of his or her investment capital, or even be liable for losses in excess of the original capital investment.|$|E

50|$|On 12 March, {{the volume}} of trading had reached 3,875,910 shares, an all-time high. By 20 June, 5,052,790 shares were traded in a falling market that many prematurely thought signalled {{the end of the}} bull market. Prices rose once more and after the {{election}} of Hoover, with a “victory boom” resulting in an all-time record trading of 6,641,250 shares in a rising market (16 November). Overall, the market rose during the year from 245 to 331 which was accompanied by a phenomenal increase in <b>trading</b> <b>on</b> <b>margin,</b> which relieved the buyer from putting up the full purchase price of the stock by using the securities as collateral for a loan. The buyer obtained full benefit of ownership in rising stock valuation, but the loan amount remained the same. People swarmed to buy stock on margin. In the early 1920s, brokers' loans used to finance purchases on margin averaged 1-1.5 billion but by November 1928 had reached six billion. By the end of 1928, the interest on such loans was yielding 12% to lenders which led to a flood of gold converging on Wall St. {{from all over the world}} to fuel the purchase of stocks on margin.|$|E
50|$|Leading {{up to the}} crash, in {{an attempt}} to free up {{additional}} money for trading, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), responsible for proposing and enforcing securities laws, had loosened several related financial regulations. Prior to significant policy reform in 2010, the act of selling short - essentially, borrowing and selling stock with the belief that its price will fall - and <b>trading</b> <b>on</b> <b>margin</b> - trading with debt - were strictly prohibited in China. However, in March 2010, China implemented a testing phase for their stock exchange in which 90 selected companies were authorized to be sold short and traded on margin. This list was expanded over time, with over 280 companies being given the same authorization in late 2011. Shortly thereafter, the CSRC implemented a total policy shift which legalized both practices across the entire stock market. These regulation changes led to significant increases in borrowing for the purpose of trading, and short selling became the most popular investing strategy among traders. From 2010, when the changes were implemented, to 2012, average daily short turnover increased from 0.01% to 0.73%, and average daily margin purchase turnover increased from 0.78% to 5.15%. As a result, the Chinese market was being flooded with debt-funded trades and risky short selling plays.|$|E
5000|$|A Bull is a {{stock market}} {{speculator}} who buys a holding in a stock in the expectation that in the very short-term it will rise in value whereupon he will sell the stock {{to make a quick}} profit on the transaction. Strictly speaking the term applies to speculators who borrow money to fund such a purchase, and are thus under great pressure to complete the transaction before the loan is repayable or the seller of the stock demands payment on settlement day for delivery of the bargain. If the value of the stock falls contrary to his expectation, a bull suffers a loss, frequently very large if he is <b>trading</b> <b>on</b> <b>margin.</b> A bull has a great incentive to [...] "talk-up" [...] the value of his stock or to manipulate the market in his stock, for example by spreading false rumour, to procure a buyer or to cause a temporary price increase which will provide him with the selling opportunity and profit he requires. A bull must therefore be contrasted with an investor, who purchases a stock in expectation of a medium-term (say 5 years) or long-term increase in value due to the underlying performance of the company and its assets. The speculator who takes a directly opposite view to the bull is the bear, who speculates on a stock decreasing in value, having sold short. A bull market is a period during which stock market prices rise over a sustained period, therefore to the advantage of bulls.|$|E

50|$|The {{main risk}} is market risk as the {{contract}} is designed to pay {{the difference between the}} opening price and the closing price of the underlying asset. CFDs are <b>traded</b> <b>on</b> <b>margin,</b> and the leveraging effect of this increases the risk significantly. Margin rates are typically small and therefore a small amount of money can be used to hold a large position. It is this very risk that drives the use of CFDs, either to speculate on movements in financial markets or to hedge existing positions in other products. One of the ways to mitigate this risk is the use of stop loss orders. Users typically deposit an amount of money with the CFD provider to cover the margin and can lose much more than this deposit if the market moves against them.|$|R

40|$|The present paper aims to {{determine}} the effects of different levels of economic integration on the intensive and the extensive margins of trade. Specifically, the analysis focuses on the case of Latin America. It is of great importance for development policies in the region since the extensive margin can be defined as those exports that provide new market entrants, while the intensive margin is due to continued growth in sales of old exporters to the same destinations. Therefore, obtained results have important policy implications related to diversification strategies. The long-term period considered will allow us {{to determine}} whether different effects <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> <b>margins</b> might arise in the following two sub-periods: 1962 ~ 1989 and from 1990 onwards, i. e. before and after the spread of regional integration agreements and the deepening of the liberalization process in the region. Finally, we focus on those specific sectors in which Latin American countries present a higher relative participation of trade. The obtained results show that the effect of economic integration is both time and period sensitive. The main positive effects are found to be reflected in the intensive margin for all different types of agreements. Moreover, we find that deeper economic integration agreements have the greatest effect <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> <b>margins.</b> Laura Márquez-Ramos, Luis Marcelo Florensa and María Luisa Recald...|$|R

Investors are divided into three classes (bankrupt, surviving and proﬁtable) instead of the standard two (bankrupt/bad and surviving/good). As a result, bubble bursting can be thwarted, since maintaining credit absorption for the qualiﬁed investors can prevent the collapse of prices.
