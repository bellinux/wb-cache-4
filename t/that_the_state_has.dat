5|$|Many of the {{hospitals}} in Enugu are privately run. The UNTH and the National Orthopaedic Hospital are {{among some of}} the government controlled hospitals in the city. The medical equipment for the UNTH was upgraded in 2009 as well as parts of the hospital which were renovated in the same year. Most hospitals in the city suffer from a poor standard of medical facilities available to them; many of the city's citizens travel abroad for medical care. However, hospitals have been aided by foreign organisations and by Enugu's community at home and abroad who have donated medicine and other medical equipment. The most developed government hospital in Enugu is the Park Lane Hospital. The governor has said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>has</b> bought some ambulance service vehicles in March 2010. Enugu State has established free medical care for pregnant women and for all children under 5 years of age in the state. The child healthcare programme, founded under the District Health System (DHS), was added to the states 2008 budget. Enugu State has a HIV/AIDS prevalence of 6.5%, one of the highest in the country.|$|E

25|$|The {{state has}} 78 {{hydropower}} dams. They generate 143 MW, about 12% of the state's total requirement. Vermont experts estimate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>has</b> {{the capacity to}} ultimately generate from 134 to 175 megawatts of electricity from hydro power.|$|E
50|$|In {{answer to}} these questions, <b>the</b> court held <b>that</b> {{it was not}} {{satisfied}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>had</b> passed <b>the</b> first hurdle: It had failed to prove, {{beyond a reasonable doubt}}, that Arnold’s conduct was voluntary. Even if it had, though, the court was not satisfied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>had</b> proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Arnold had criminal capacity at the relevant time. He was therefore acquitted.|$|R

50|$|To Brooks' {{contention}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> directly authorized <b>the</b> re-sale of her possessions {{under the}} UCC, Rehnquist responded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> UCC merely embodied <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> {{decision not to}} involve itself in the debtor-lendor dispute. If <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> failed to pass any law related to the re-sale, {{there could be no}} contention <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> acted in any way. Codification of <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> intent to not involve its courts in the re-sale of repossessed goods still equated to a refusal to act.|$|R

25|$|In 2003, the Arizona Court of Appeals, in a {{decision}} Standhardt v. Superior Court (77 P.3d 451, 463-464) with regards to Arizona's state marriage law, a three judge panel concluded that the petitioners had failed {{to prove that the}} State's prohibition of same sex marriage is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest holding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>has</b> a legitimate interest in encouraging procreation and child-rearing within the marital relationship, and that limiting marriage to the union of one man and one woman is rationally related to that interest and that even assuming that the State's reasoning for prohibiting same sex marriage was debatable, it was not 'arbitrary' or 'irrational'.|$|E
500|$|Forty {{years after}} the war, two sisters who had been raped were interviewed by Deutsche Welle. Aleya stated she had been taken by the Pakistani army when she was thirteen, and was gang raped {{repeatedly}} for seven months. She states she was tortured and was five months pregnant {{when she returned to}} her home. Her sister, Laily, says she was pregnant when she was taken by the armed forces, and lost the child. Later she fought alongside the Mukti Bahini. Both say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>has</b> failed the birangona, and that all they received was [...] "humiliation, insults, hatred, and ostracism." ...|$|E

2500|$|More formally, in {{the context}} of QFT, the S-matrix is defined as the unitary matrix {{connecting}} sets of asymptotically free particle states (the in-states and the out-states) in the Hilbert space of physical states. A multi-particle state is said to be free (non-interacting) if it transforms under Lorentz transformations as a tensor product, or direct product in physics parlance, of one-particle states as prescribed by equation [...] below. Asymptotically free then means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>has</b> this appearance in either the distant past or the distant future.|$|E
2500|$|Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., , is a {{landmark}} {{decision of the}} Supreme Court of the United States concerning the First Amendment {{and the ability of}} the government to outlaw certain forms of expressive conduct. It ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>has</b> the constitutional authority to ban public nudity, even as part of expressive conduct such as dancing, because it furthers a substantial government interest in protecting the morality and order of society. This case is perhaps best summarized by a sentence in Justice Souter's concurring opinion, which is often paraphrased as [...] "Nudity itself is not inherently expressive conduct." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> {{failed to}} provide a [...] "minimally adequate" [...] {{education}} to children {{in all parts of}} <b>the</b> <b>state</b> as required by <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> constitution.|$|R

2500|$|While {{governments are}} allowed to invade {{the privacy of their}} {{citizens}} in some cases, they are expected to protect privacy in all cases lacking a compelling state interest. In the US, the compelling state interest test has been developed in accordance with the standards of strict scrutiny. [...] In Roe v Wade, the Court decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>has</b> an [...] "important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life" [...] from the point of viability on, but that prior to viability, the woman's fundamental rights are [...] more compelling than that of the state.|$|E
2500|$|In Conaway v. Deane (2003), [...] the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>has</b> a {{legitimate}} interest in encouraging a family structure {{in which children}} are born. The court then refrained from deciding whether this interest was served by the status quo, leaving {{it to the other}} branches to decide. The Massachusetts Supreme Court concluded in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health that even if it were the case that children fare better when raised by opposite-sex parents, the argument against same-sex marriage is unsound because the state failed to show how banning same-sex marriages discouraged gay and lesbian individuals from forming families or how restricting marriage to heterosexual couples discouraged heterosexual individuals from having nonmarital children.|$|E
2500|$|William Godwin, in {{founding}} philosophical anarchism, developed {{what many}} consider the first expression of modern anarchist thought. Godwin was, according to Peter Kropotkin, [...] "the first to formulate {{the political and}} economical conceptions of anarchism, {{even though he did}} not give that name to the ideas developed in his work." [...] Philosophical anarchism contends that the state lacks moral legitimacy; that there is no individual obligation or duty to obey the State, and conversely, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>has</b> no right to command individuals, but it does not advocate revolution to eliminate the state. According to The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought, philosophical anarchism [...] "is a component especially of individualist anarchism." ...|$|E
50|$|Interposition {{is closely}} related to the theory of nullification, which holds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to nullify federal laws that are deemed unconstitutional and to prevent {{enforcement}} of such laws within their borders.|$|R
50|$|The Federalist Papers do not assert <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{power to}} nullify federal law. On the contrary, they say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> power to declare laws unconstitutional {{concerning}} is delegated to federal courts, not <b>the</b> <b>states.</b>|$|R
500|$|The Seneca's lawyer, John H. Martindale, later {{appeared}} before the U.S. Supreme Court, as New York Attorney General, in In re New York Indians (1866), arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> right to tax the Senecas. [...] The Court disagreed. In the case below, plaintiffs Joseph Fellows (the defendant in Fellows), Louisa Troup, and George R. Babcock sought to recover a plot of land from Robert Denniston (in his official capacity as New York State Comptroller) and Thomas W. Olcott, the purchaser at the tax foreclosure sale. Fellows, Troup, and Babcock argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> no power to tax the Seneca. In re New York Indians, agreeing, cited Fellows: ...|$|R
2500|$|The Court {{had been}} told that there was {{evidence}} of collusion by elements of the British state in at least three of the cases and Mr. Justice Treacy said that there was a [...] "credible expectation of collusion" [...] in the remaining cases. Therefore, he concluded, the decision of the Chief Constable to end the broader review into the activities of the Glenanne gang and the alleged collusion of elements of the British state in those murders had resulted in a [...] "real risk that this will fuel {{in the minds of the}} families the fear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>has</b> resiled from its public commitments because it is not genuinely committed to addressing the unresolved concerns that the families have of state involvement." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{said that}} the lower courts had repudiated a central premise of Casey — <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>has</b> an {{interest}} in preserving fetal life — and the Court held that the ban fit that interest {{so as not to}} create an undue burden. The opinion did not rely deferentially on Congress's findings that this intact dilation and extraction procedure is never needed to protect the health of a pregnant woman; in fact the Court found that [...] "evidence presented in the District Courts contradicts that conclusion." [...] However, Kennedy wrote that a health exception was unnecessary: where medical testimony disputes Congress's findings, Congress is still entitled to regulate in an area where the medical community has not reached a [...] "consensus." ...|$|E

"At (Cambridge) {{university}} I {{first became}} {{conscious of the}} creative role of politics in shaping human affairs, and I owe that mostly to my teachers Joan Robinson and Nicholas Kaldor. Joan Robinson was a brilliant teacher, but she also sought to awaken the inner conscience of her students {{in a manner that}} very few others were able to achieve. She questioned me a great deal and made me think the unthinkable. She propounded the left wing interpretation of Keynes, maintaining <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>has</b> to play more of a role {{if you really want to}} combine development with social equity. Kaldor influenced me even more; I found him pragmatic, scintillating, stimulating. Joan Robinson was a great admirer of what was going on in China, but Kaldor used the Keynesian analysis to demonstrate that capitalism could be made to work." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment {{protects against}} the {{deprivation}} of liberty interests {{at the hands of}} the state. [...] In order to trigger due process protection, the liberty interest in question must be more than merely abstract or theoretical; it must be something to which a person has a [...] "legitimate claim of entitlement". [...] No prisoner has a liberty interest in being released before his sentence expires, because the trial and appeals processes have ensured <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>has</b> lawfully deprived the person of his interest in being free from confinement. [...] A state may create a parole system for its prisoners, but it is not required to do so. [...] Parole exists as an adjunct to the penological goals of rehabilitation and deterrence. [...] Like the prison system itself, the parole regime is created and managed by the executive branch, which has no obligation to make error-free determinations in executing the laws.|$|E
2500|$|On December 17, 2014, {{nine months}} after Zach Adams' arrest, Judge Creed McGinley chastised {{prosecutors}} for delays {{in the case and}} for the state's failure to turn over evidence to the defense.

Judge McGinley ordered that a bill of particulars will be filed for Zachary Adams' case within seven days and that discovery will take place immediately. The prosecution ignored both deadlines. In response, attorneys for the men filed motions to dismiss charges. The motions filed accuses the state of [...] "silence or stonewalling", stating that, among other things, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>has</b> yet to disclose evidence that the skull found belongs to Bobo. [...] "It would appear to me if they had a skull with a dental match they would have given that to us right away.

2500|$|With {{literally}} {{minutes to}} go before being indicted (according {{to at least one}} source, the grand jury was actually in the process of voting on the indictment), Drexel reached an agreement with the government in which it entered an Alford plea to six felonies—three counts of stock parking and three counts of stock manipulation. [...] It also agreed to pay a fine of $650 million—at the time, the largest fine ever levied under the Great Depression-era securities laws. [...] The government had dropped several of the demands that had initially angered Drexel, but continued to insist that Milken leave the firm if indicted—which he did shortly after his own indictment in March 1989. [...] In an Alford plea the defendant maintains their claim of innocence, while acknowledging <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>has</b> sufficient evidence to prove them guilty, in Drexel's case, [...] "not in a position to dispute the allegations." [...] Nonetheless, Drexel was now a convicted felon.|$|E
