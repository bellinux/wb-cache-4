5|$|The Griffin {{family first}} {{appeared}} on the demo that MacFarlane pitched <b>to</b> <b>Fox</b> on May 15, 1998. Family Guy was originally planned to start out as short movies for the sketch show MADtv, but the plan changed because MADtv's budget was not large enough to support animation production. MacFarlane noted that he then wanted to pitch it <b>to</b> <b>Fox,</b> as he thought {{that that was the}} place to create a prime-time animation show. Family Guy was originally pitched <b>to</b> <b>Fox</b> in the same year as King of the Hill, but the show was not bought until years later, when King of the Hill became successful. Fox ordered 13 episodes of Family Guy to air in midseason after MacFarlane impressed executives with a seven-minute demo.|$|E

Series creator Chris Carter decided to make use of this rig during the fourth season.

5|$|Life's Shop Window was {{the first}} film produced, rather than simply distributed, by William Fox's Box Office Attractions Company, the {{corporate}} predecessor <b>to</b> <b>Fox</b> Film. Several reviewers approved of the film's expurgated treatment of the novel's plot, although opinions {{of the quality of}} the film itself were mixed. It proved very popular upon its initial release in New York, and that success was used to advertise the film elsewhere. Like many of Fox's early works, it was likely lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire.|$|E

5|$|A mid-credits scene teasing X-Men: Days of Future Past was {{attached}} to the theatrical release of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 in April 2014. In the scene, which is set during the Vietnam War, Mystique tries to infiltrate a military camp led by William Stryker to recruit fellow mutants Havok, Ink, and Toad. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 director Marc Webb had an existing contract with Fox Searchlight Pictures to direct another film following 500 Days of Summer (2009). After The Amazing Spider-Man, Webb's negotiations with Sony Pictures Entertainment stalled because of his commitment <b>to</b> <b>Fox.</b> Fox eventually agreed to allow Webb to direct the sequel of The Amazing Spider-Man, and in exchange, Sony promoted the X-Men film without charge. In addition, three viral websites were launched before the release of the filmTrask-Industries.com in July 2013, TheBentBullet.com in November 2013 and 25Moments.com in April 2014. To further promote the film, Jackman made a guest appearance on the April 28, 2014, episode of WWE Raw. The segment received mixed reactions.|$|E

In the meeting is Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers), an acquaintance from Mulder's past. The Smoking Man is reunited with the Syndicate members, including the First Elder and the Well-Manicured Man, who want him {{to help them with}} the situation concerning Gibson. Fowley accompanies Mulder and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) as they go visit Gibson in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Mulder believes that Gibson can read minds, hence his expertise at chess. Scully learns that Mulder and Diana know each other from long ago.|$|E
5|$|Given {{its subject}} matter, the episode {{features}} many references to witchcraft and occultism. The nurse from the episode, Rebecca Waite, was originally {{named after a}} friend of the writers called Rebecca White. However, this was changed because there was a real nurse from Chicago whose last name was White. Some viewers ended up believing that Waite's name as a reference to either Rebecca Nurse, an innocent woman prosecuted during the Salem witch trials, or the Rider-Waite tarot deck, the most popular tarot deck utilized in the world. The episode itself directly references Gerald Gardner, a wiccan known for publishing several books on witchcraft and founder of the Gardnerian Tradition. While the Mayhew sisters tried to depict occultism without offending anybody by not connecting Franklin or Waite to any known cult, many Wiccans sent angry letters and e-mails <b>to</b> <b>Fox</b> regarding the portrayal of their beliefs.|$|E
