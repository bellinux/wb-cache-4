50|$|Prolapsed uterus in cattle, {{particularly}} dairy cattle, generally {{occurs in}} the first 12 hours post-calving. Frequent causes are hypocalcemia combined with irritation of the birth canal, causing straining. Replacement of the protrusion, which can range from {{the size of a}} softball to the hanging of the entire uterus down below the hocks, is performed with the cow in sternal recumbency, an epidural injection, and hindlimbs 'frogged' rearwards to allow the pelvis to <b>tip</b> <b>forward,</b> easing replacement. Careful washing and cleaning prior to replacement is important as is ensuring that the horns are completely everted once inside the cow. Often a Buhner suture is placed in the vulva to prevent subsequent reprolapse.|$|E
5000|$|Blue-breasted rollers breed {{from late}} April to mid-September in Somalia. Lilac-breasted rollers breed {{at various times}} of the year, {{depending}} on the location and season. Both subspecies are monogamous and build flat nests of grass in dead baobab, coconut, or a casuarina trees. Some birds may nest in hollowed out tree cavities about [...] off the ground. Lilac-breasted rollers do not create the cavities themselves; they take over nest spaces that have been previously hollowed out by woodpeckers or kingfishers. Males and females are protective of the nest and will fly in a rolling pattern as a territorial display. During courtship, lilac-breasted rollers with fly upwards and then <b>tip</b> <b>forward</b> with the wings closed. Then they will flap their wings to gain speed towards the ground while calling loudly.|$|E
50|$|The timing {{mechanism}} {{is based on}} a water-filled basin hidden inside the elephant. In the bucket is a deep bowl floating in the water, but with a small hole in the centre. The bowl takes half an hour to fill through this hole. In the process of sinking, the bowl pulls a string attached to a see-saw mechanism in the tower on top of the elephant. This releases a ball that drops into the mouth of a serpent, causing the serpent to <b>tip</b> <b>forward,</b> which pulls the sunken bowl out of the water via strings. At the same time, a system of strings causes a figure in the tower to raise either the left or right hand and the mahout (elephant driver at the front) to hit a drum. This indicates a half or full hour. Next, the snake tips back. The cycle then repeats, as long as balls remain in the upper reservoir to power the emptying of the bowl.|$|E

5000|$|Santoku blade {{geometry}} {{incorporates the}} sheep's foot tip. A sheep's foot design essentially draws the spine ("backstrap") {{down to the}} front, with very little clearance above the horizontal cutting plane when the blade is resting naturally from heel to forward cutting edge. Providing a more linear cutting edge, the Santoku has limited [...] "rocking" [...] travel (in comparison to a German/Western-style chef's knife). The Santoku {{may be used in}} a rocking motion; however, very little cutting edge makes contact with the surface due to the extreme radius of the tip and very little [...] "tip travel" [...] occurs due to the short cantilever span from contact landing to tip. An example of this limitation can be demonstrated in dicing an onion—a Western knife generally slices downward and then rocks the <b>tip</b> <b>forward</b> to complete a cut; the Santoku relies more on a single downward cut and even landing from heel to tip, thus using less of a rocking motion than Western style cutlery.|$|E

50|$|Restored to full {{working order}} by Sheffield City Council in the 1990s. The Fore & Aft tipper {{was based on}} a Faun design and was an early {{solution}} to the decreased density of refuse requiring some means of compaction. In this design the vehicle's body could be <b>tipped</b> <b>forwards</b> to allow the weight of the refuse to compress the load. Rearward tipping discharged the load. On later models as GWJ 667 J a hydraulically operated plate secured to the roof of the body gave extra compaction when <b>tipped</b> <b>forwards.</b> This device was known as a Powerpress. The Sheffield version is a narrow bodied model designed for use in narrow streets.|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} a fatigue crack is {{generally}} modeled in terms of empirical rules such as the Paris law [1] which states that da/dN = A(ΔK) m where a is the crack length, N {{is the number of}} fatigue cycles at a particular stress intensity range ΔK and A and m are material constants. Recently, evidence has accumulated that establishes that the full excursion of the applied load or the full stress intensity range does not drive the crack <b>tip</b> <b>forward</b> due to a variety of phenomena often referred to as crack tip shielding [2, 3]. This shielding arises {{as a consequence of the}} formation of contacting asperities between the surfaces of the fatigue crack. Since these contacting asperities bear a portion of the load, they modify the stress intensity at the tip, thereby altering the growth rate...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the growth}} and {{function}} of plant roots in cold climates is critical, but examination of root systems to elucidate their link to production is expensive and labor-intensive. Limited information {{is available on the}} root growth and functions of plants grown in northern climates. Our objective is to present an overview of the influence of physical edaphic factors on plant root systems with special emphasis on models that are available for simulating root growth. This report summarizes the impact of the soil physical environment (soil water, soil temperature, soil air, physi-cal impedance, and spatial variability) on root uptake and growth. Roots grow because new cells are formed in the meristematic tissue near the root tip, and these newly formed cells increase in volume, pushing the root <b>tip</b> <b>forward</b> if growth conditions are satisfactory. Rapid elongation of primary roots, combined with well-developed secondary roots, allows the plants to exploit moisture and nutrients from a greater soil volume. Root and shoots are strongly interdependent. The roots receive photosynthate...|$|E
40|$|The mouse is {{a genetically}} {{tractable}} model organism widely {{used to study}} mammalian development and disease. However, mouse metaphase II (mII) oocytes are exquisitely sensitive and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) with conventional pipettes generally kills them. This problem can be solved with piezo-actuated micromanipulation, in which the piezo-electric effect (crystal deformation {{in response to an}} externally applied voltage) propels a microinjection needle <b>tip</b> <b>forward</b> in a precise and rapid movement. Piezo-actuated micromanipulation enhances the penetration of membranes and matrices, and mouse ICSI is a major application. Here we describe a comprehensive, step-by-step mouse piezo ICSI protocol for non-specialists that can be completed in 2 - 4 h. The protocol is a basic prelude to multiple applications, including nuclear transfer cloning, spermatid injection, blastocyst injection, mII transgenesis, and streamlining micromanipulation in primates and livestock. Moreover, piezo ICSI can be used to obtain offspring from 'dead' (non-motile) sperm, enabling trivial sperm freezing protocols for mouse strain storage and shipment...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{multiscale}} {{model of}} brittle crack propagation in an Ag plate with macroscopic dimensions has been developed. The model represents crack propagation as stochastic drift-diffusion {{motion of the}} crack tip atom through the material, and couples the dynamics across three different length scales. It integrates the nanomechanics of bond rupture at the crack tip with the displacement and stress field equations of continuum based fracture theories. The finite element method is employed to obtain the continuum based displacement and stress fields over the macroscopic plate, and these are then used to drive the crack <b>tip</b> <b>forward</b> at the atomic level using the molecular dynamics simulation method based on many-body interatomic potentials. The linkage from the nanoscopic scale back to the macroscopic scale is established via the Ito stochastic calculus, the stochastic differential equation of which advances the tip to a new position on the macroscopic scale using the crack velocity and diffusion constant obtained on the nanoscale. Well known crack characteristics, such as the roughening transitions of the crack surfaces, crack velocity oscillations, {{as well as the}} macroscopic crack trajectories, are obtained...|$|E
40|$|A novel multi-scale {{seamless}} {{model of}} brittle-crack propagation is proposed {{and applied to}} the simulation of fracture growth in a two-dimensional Ag plate with macroscopic dimensions. The model represents the crack propagation at the macroscopic scale as the drift-diffusion motion of the crack tip alone. The diffusive motion {{is associated with the}} crack-tip coordinates in the position space, and reflects the oscillations observed in the crack velocity following its critical value. The model couples the crack dynamics at the macroscales and nanoscales via an intermediate mesoscale continuum. The finite-element method is employed to make the transition from the macroscale to the nanoscale by computing the continuum-based displacements of the atoms at the boundary of an atomic lattice embedded within the plate and surrounding the tip. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation then drives the crack <b>tip</b> <b>forward,</b> producing the tip critical velocity and its diffusion constant. These are then used in the Ito stochastic calculus to make the reverse transition from the nanoscale back to the macroscale. The MD-level modelling is based on the use of a many-body potential. The model successfully reproduces the crack-velocity oscillations, roughening transitions of the crack surfaces, as well as the macroscopic crack trajectory. The implications for a 3 -D modelling are discussed...|$|E
