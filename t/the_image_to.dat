5|$|Each carving {{receives}} a special name, and common motifs are {{animals and plants}} that symbolise some virtue. For example, water plants and animals, such as crabs, tadpoles and water weeds, are commonly found to symbolise fertility. In some areas noble elders claim these symbols refer to strength of noble family, but not everyone agrees. The overall meaning of groups of carved motifs on houses remains debated and tourism has further complicated these debates because some feel a uniform explanation must be presented to tourists. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>to</b> the left shows an example of Torajan wood carving, consisting of 15 square panels. The center bottom panel represents buffalo or wealth, a wish for many buffaloes for the family. The center panel represents a knot and a box, a hope {{that all of the}} family's offspring will be happy and live in harmony, like goods kept safe in a box. The top left and top right squares represent an aquatic animal, indicating the need for fast and hard work, just like moving on the surface of water. It also represents the need for a certain skill to produce good results.|$|E
5|$|The {{image of}} the masque within the play deals with hiding one's identity. Fielding, like many other playwrights, focuses on how the masque genre deals with the social {{acceptability}} of altering identities within the format. However, Fielding extends <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>to</b> discuss society and those who impersonate social and gender roles {{that they do not}} fill. Fielding also has a problem with those who act viciously with license even though he is willing to accept some of the lesser libertine actions. Merital, for instance, is a sexual type of libertine and is treated differently than those like Sir Positive Trap, Lord Formal, and Sir Apish Simple who are criticised as being part of the corrupted order. Trap and Formal are part of old families, and their attachment to the age of their families and their attempts to use that to justify their beliefs over what is proper is ridiculed within the play. In particular, Merital is the one able to point out their flaws.|$|E

25|$|One form of {{behavioral}} neuropharmacology {{focuses on the}} study of drug dependence and how drug addiction affects the human mind. Most research has shown that the major part of the brain that reinforces addiction through neurochemical reward is the nucleus accumbens. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>to</b> the right shows how dopamine is projected into this area. Chronic alcohol abuse can cause dependence and addiction. How this addiction occurs is described below.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study which explored the use of Flickr by cultural heritage institutions. The study examined two aspects of museums’ use of Flickr: <b>the</b> content of <b>images</b> posted by museums, and the reasons behind sharing their <b>images</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> social media site. Images were categorized by the researchers into nine classes based on their visible content, and a brief questionnaire was used to gather data about <b>the</b> <b>image</b> sharing process from museum personnel. The findings reveal that imagery of people visiting the museum and taking part in museum events predominated in the total number of images posted by museums (54 % of <b>the</b> total). <b>The</b> <b>images</b> posted <b>to</b> Flickr were most often selected by a single individual at the institution. <b>The</b> particular <b>images</b> posted <b>to</b> Flickr were chosen for a variety of reasons, the most common of these being that they were newsworthy recent events at the museum (e. g. openings, exhibitions, lectures, etc.), or that the staff found <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>to</b> have strong affective characteristics. In the responses from museum staff regarding the motivations behind posting <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>to</b> Flickr two replies were most commonly given: to provide access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>images,</b> and <b>to</b> take advantage of the technical benefits provided by the photo-sharing service...|$|R

25|$|Retinal {{detachment}} can {{be examined}} by fundus photography or ophthalmoscopy. Fundus photography generally needs a considerably larger instrument than the ophthalmoscope, {{but has the}} advantage of availing <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>to</b> be examined by a specialist at another location and/or time, as well as providing photo documentation for future reference. Modern fundus photographs generally recreate considerably larger areas of the fundus than what can be seen at any one time with handheld ophthalmoscopes.|$|E
25|$|While {{the image}} garners much {{religious}} devotion and Mexican patriotism, scholarly criticism {{on the image}} is also notable, considering the artistic disproportion of the image, the similarity of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>to</b> Spanish pre-colonial artwork {{closely related to the}} Aztec colony at the time, the alleged relationship of Marcos Cipac de Aquino in either inventing or amending the tilma cloak, and the public declaration of the abbot of the Guadalupe shrine pertaining to the false existence of the Marian apparitions.|$|E
25|$|When {{the main}} {{electron}} gun writes an image to the screen, the {{energy in the}} main beam is sufficient to create a 'potential relief' on the storage mesh. The areas where this relief is created no longer repel the electrons from the flood gun which now pass through the mesh and illuminate the phosphor screen. Consequently, the image that was briefly traced out by the main gun continues to be displayed after it has occurred. The image can be 'erased' by resupplying the external voltage to the mesh restoring its constant potential. The time for which the image can be displayed was limited because, in practice, the flood gun slowly neutralises the charge on the storage mesh. One way of allowing <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>to</b> be retained for longer is temporarily {{to turn off the}} flood gun. It is then possible for <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>to</b> be retained for several days. The majority of storage tubes allow for a lower voltage to be applied to the storage mesh which slowly restores the initial charge state. By varying this voltage a variable persistence is obtained. Turning off the flood gun and the voltage supply to the storage mesh allows such a tube to operate as a conventional oscilloscope tube.|$|E
