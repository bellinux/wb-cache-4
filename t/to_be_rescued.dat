5|$|Operating from a joint British-Dutch base at Ceylon, Telemachus sank the Japanese Kadai-class {{submarine}} I-166 in the Strait of Malacca on 17 July 1944. Telemachus tracked I-166 for 30 minutes, then fired {{a spread}} of six torpedoes. One torpedo hit, and sank the Japanese boat with 89 lives lost; five men on bridge watch survived <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rescued</b> by the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|September 1, 2006- The {{combined}} {{effects of}} Tropical Storm Ernesto {{and a large}} high-pressure system leave about 151,000 without power and several trees damaged from strong winds. The system also drops moderate rainfall peaking at 5.15inches (129mm) in Jones Crossing; one person requires assistance <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rescued</b> from a flooded roadway.|$|E

5|$|Alex's outer rainbands {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} across Virginia, peaking at over 7inches (178mm) {{in the center}} of the state. The rainfall caused localized flooding, but there was no reported damage in the state. In Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, rip currents produced by the storm injured three people. A few young children had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rescued</b> when they were trapped by a jetty. In New Jersey, the strong surf and rip currents hospitalized at least five swimmers.|$|E
5|$|An unusually {{heavy rain}} storm {{affected}} a GO train on July 8, 2013, when a record-breaking 123mm fell {{over a few}} hours. A Richmond Hill-bound GO train encountered flood waters in the Don Valley and stopped. As the crew worked to change {{the direction of the}} train, flood waters continued to rise and submerged the tracks behind the train. The train itself began to flood, and approximately 1,400 passengers had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rescued</b> by boat.|$|E
5|$|At 2pm on Wednesday, March 21, the Spray {{collided}} with the Lucinda four miles north of Barnegat, New Jersey, knocking {{a hole in the}} Sprays bow that resulted in her filling with water; the Lucinda also sustained damage. Capt. Willis of the Lucinda saw no one other than Jackalow (whom he blamed for the collision) on board the Spray, and Jackalow refused <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rescued</b> and taken aboard the Lucinda. Willis observed that the deck of the Spray was strewn with bedding and other articles from the cabin.|$|E

5|$|In New Jersey, {{the storm}} {{produced}} heavy rainfall, peaking at 8.1inches (205mm) in Tuckerton. The rains also caused river flooding, including the north {{branch of the}} Metedeconk River in Lakewood which crested at 8feet (2.5m). The flooding, severe at places, closed several roads, including numerous state highways. Gusty winds of up to 44mph (71km/h) in Atlantic City downed weak trees and power lines, leaving over 13,000 without power. Several people had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rescued</b> from high waters, though no fatalities occurred in the state. Overall damage was minimal.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{was lost}} to the Rangers early in the 1928–29 season when he {{suffered}} a broken ankle during a December game against the Maroons. A couple days after his injury, he had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rescued</b> when a fire threatened the Montreal hospital he was convalescing at. Johnson missed virtually the entire regular season with the injury, but returned {{in time for the}} 1929 playoffs, and was credited with improving the Rangers' play as they reached the final against the Boston Bruins.|$|E
5|$|July 2 - Hurricane Arthur passed {{just off}} the coast of Eastern Florida. Its outer rainbands caused strong {{straight}} line winds from thunderstorms, peaking at 83mph, though these winds only caused $23,000 (2015 USD). About 2 inches of rain fell in the state as well. Strong rip currents and waves caused about a dozen swimmers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rescued</b> at Daytona Beach. Damage totaled to no more than $25,800 (2017 USD).|$|E
5000|$|W. B. Yeats (1889), [...] "The Stolen Child", {{in which}} a human child is [...] "stolen" [...] by faeries and indoctrinated into their alien way of life. The poem may reflect {{culturally}} contested values between English Protestants and Irish Celts, and has a somewhat ironical title and tone. The faeries claim (in effect) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rescuing</b> the child from [...] "a world that's full of weeping." ...|$|R

5|$|Most of {{the visual}} effects on Labyrinth were {{achieved}} in-camera, with several notable exceptions. The most prominent of these post-production effects was the computer-generated owl that appears {{at the opening of}} the film. The sequence was created by animators Larry Yaeger and Bill Kroyer, and marked the first use of a realistic CGI animal in a film. The owl head maquette had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rescued</b> from a skip (dumpster) when Omnibus, the animation company, went bankrupt in 1987.|$|E
5|$|On one occasion, the Cable Junction Island set, {{which was}} built on a barge, broke loose from its {{anchorage}} and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rescued.</b> Szwarc was contacted one night and told that his island was drifting towards Cuba. Real hammerhead sharks circled the teen actors during the filming of one shot. Because the characters they were playing {{were meant to be}} in distress, the crew (filming from a distance) did not realize that the actors were genuinely calling for help.|$|E
5|$|Titanics down angle altered fairly rapidly {{from zero}} degrees to about {{four and a}} half degrees during the first hour after the collision, but {{the rate at which the}} ship went down slowed greatly for the second hour, {{worsening}} only to about five degrees. This gave many of those aboard a false sense of hope that the ship might stay afloat long enough for them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rescued.</b> By 1:30, the sinking rate of the front section increased until Titanic reached a down angle of about ten degrees.|$|E
50|$|On 7 September 1900, Sun's first {{overseas}} visit <b>to</b> Singapore <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>rescue</b> Miyazaki Toten who {{was arrested}} there. This act resulted in his own arrest and a ban from visiting the island for five years.|$|R

5|$|After {{five days}} and {{multiple}} attempts to rescue Hambleton, five aircraft {{had been shot}} down and another 16 seriously damaged, 10 service members had been killed or were missing in action, two were POWs, and two were behind front lines also waiting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rescued.</b> On April 8, Gen. Creighton Abrams was briefed on the high losses in the several failed attempts to rescue Hambleton and Clark. He ordered that no further air CSAR would be attempted, but that given Hambleton's Top Secret clearance and knowledge of missiles and counter-measure technology, that every effort {{should be made to}} bring him out.|$|E
5|$|At 09:15, {{two more}} ships {{appeared}} on the scene– Mount Temple and Californian, which had finally learned of the disaster when her radio operator returned to duty– but by then {{there were no more}} survivors <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rescued.</b> Carpathia had been bound for Fiume, Austria-Hungary (now Rijeka, Croatia), but as she had neither the stores nor the medical facilities to cater for the survivors, Rostron ordered that a course be calculated to return the ship to New York, where the survivors could be properly looked after. Carpathia departed the area, leaving the other ships to carry out a final, fruitless, two-hour search.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the South station's demolition in 1996, thousands of pounds were spent on a number of security measures; the site was fenced off, bunding was installed, warning signs were put up and security patrols took place. However, large sections of the fencing were stolen and the warning signs were ignored. Ultimately this led to one man being trapped on the site for five hours on 22May 1997. He had been looking for scrap metal and power cables, and had climbed through a small hole into an underground room, from which he had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rescued</b> by fire crews. The site was then designated a danger zone. The derelict site was vandalised in July 1999, when people hurled burning tyres into the sub-station, creating a fire and damaging cables worth £150,000.|$|E
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} {{children}} involved {{in the production of}} the Azov films, 386 children <b>were</b> said <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>rescued</b> from exploitation by purchasers of the films. In Canada alone, 24 <b>were</b> <b>rescued.</b> while six <b>were</b> <b>rescued</b> in Australia. [...] "More than 330 children" [...] <b>were</b> stated <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>rescued</b> in the US. This high number has been questioned, since full details of the charges for 54 of the total of 76 arrests in the US had been publicly released as of Nov. 14, 2013, and these details account for fewer than 15 persons exposed as children to current or historical sexual contact. An additional 75 <b>to</b> 100 children <b>were</b> surreptitiously indecently photographed, mostly by two arrested men who were school employees. The definition of [...] "rescued child" [...] used was that [...] "the children were either being sexually abused or they were being sexually exploited by having videos taken of them in exploitative positions." [...] The 'exploitative positions' always included nudity or genital exposure.|$|R

5|$|Four years later, Taylor was {{selected}} for the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. In the 4×200m freestyle relay, he helped his team win bronze. There were no Olympic Games in 1916 because of the First World War. Taylor joined the Royal Navy in 1914 and kept fit by swimming around the ships when his ship was anchored at Scapa Flow. He {{was present at the}} Battle of Jutland. A popular story tells that {{during the course of the}} battle, his ship, HMS St. Vincent, was sunk and while the survivors waited for two hours <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rescued,</b> Taylor swam around encouraging his crewmates. However, this story is probably a myth as HMS St Vincent was not sunk at the Battle of Jutland. He was transferred to HMS Ramillies where he remained until he was demobilised.|$|E
5|$|Intermittent torrents {{battered}} Saint Kitts and Nevis for {{at least}} four days; a total of up to 10.99inches (279mm) of precipitation was recorded during that time. Several homeowners reported significant flooding, and a number of persons had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rescued</b> from their homes. Gusty winds generated rough sea conditions along coastal regions, resulting in some beach erosion and the collapse of a sidewalk section. Rains and associated floods topped a number of culverts and bridges, washed out the sides of some roadways, and damage to some utility lines, followed by significant disruptions to electricity services. The exact amount of damage to the territory remains unknown, however.|$|E
5|$|Moderate {{wave action}} {{produced}} severe beach erosion {{along the shore}} of Baltimore County at a loss of $3million (2003USD, ($ USD)). Residential areas of Millers Island, Edgemere, North Point, Bowleys Quarters and Turners Station suffered severe damage from the hurricane, with over 400people needing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rescued.</b> Over 300buildings were destroyed. The storm surge flooding killed a man in Dundalk, and either destroyed or greatly damaged most marinas. Strong winds downed 118trees on school grounds and hundreds of others elsewhere, some of which fell on power lines which resulted in leaving 220,000customers without power. The passage of Hurricane Isabel left 3,189tons (2,893t) of debris across the county.|$|E
