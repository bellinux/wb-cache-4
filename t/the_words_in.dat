5|$|The core game {{is based}} on Hangman. Each round has a {{category}} and a blank word puzzle, with each blank representing a letter in the answer, and punctuation revealed as needed. Most puzzles are straightforward figures of speech that fit within a mostly static list of categories, and this list has evolved {{over the course of}} the series. Crossword puzzles were added to the rotation in 2016. In such rounds, a clue bonding <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> the puzzle is given instead of a traditional category, and contestants win by solving all <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> the crossword. The titular Wheel of Fortune is a roulette-style wheel mechanism with 24 spaces, most of which are labeled with dollar amounts ranging from $500 to $900, plus a top dollar value: $2,500 in round 1, $3,500 in rounds 2 and 3, and $5,000 for round 4 and any subsequent rounds. The wheel also features two Bankrupt wedges and one Lose a Turn, both of which forfeit the contestant's turn, with the former also eliminating any cash or prizes the contestant has accumulated within the round. Each game features three contestants, or occasionally, three two-contestant teams positioned behind a single scoreboard with its own flipper. The left scoreboard from the viewer's perspective is colored red, the center yellow, and the right blue, with the contestants' positions determined by a random selection prior to taping.|$|E
5|$|The letter, {{which is}} a {{response}} to Boniface who had requested his support, reveals Ælfwald's sound understanding of Latin. Ælfwald's letter reassures Boniface that his name was being remembered by the East Angles: it contains an offer to exchange the names of their dead, so that mutual prayers could be read for them. According to Richard Hoggett, a phrase in the letter, 'in septenis monasteriorum nostorum sinaxis', has been interpreted incorrectly by historians to imply that there were at the time seven monasteries in Ælfwald's kingdom in which prayers were being read, a theory which has proved difficult for scholars to explain. Hoggett argues that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> the phrase refer to the number of times that the monks offered praise during the monastic day and not to the number of monasteries then in existence. He points out that this interpretation was published by Haddan and Stubbs as long ago as 1869.|$|E
25|$|The {{proportion}} of vocabulary of Chinese origin thus {{tends to be}} greater in technical, scientific, abstract or formal language or registers. For example, Sino-Japanese words account for about 35% of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> entertainment magazines (where borrowings from English are common), over half <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> newspapers and 60% of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> science magazines.|$|E

25|$|Biblical {{literature}} uses several {{words in}} its original languages to refer to different types of alcoholic beverages.

While some deuterocanonical books may have been originally written in Hebrew or the Aramaic language, some were written in Greek. Hence, the meanings of the words used for alcoholic beverages {{in each of these}} languages has bearing on alcohol in the Bible.|$|E
