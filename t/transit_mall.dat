5|$|The Metro Transit Committee {{debated the}} {{inclusion}} of the bus tunnel in the project's environmental impact assessment well into 1983, Seattle members opposing the tunnel in favor of a <b>transit</b> <b>mall</b> and suburban members supporting a bus tunnel that would be converted to a light rail system. On September 22, UMTA requested that a preferred alternative be declared by the end of November, which prompted the Metro Council to expedite its decision. Metro Council Executive Director Neil Peterson favored the tunnel alternative, while the Seattle City Council and Mayor Charles Royer preferred the <b>transit</b> <b>mall,</b> but stated that a tunnel would be a long-term solution to downtown congestion. The Seattle City Council reversed its decision on their preferred alternative, voting unanimously on October 17 in favor of an electric-only transit tunnel. Along with Mayor Royer, they were willing to compromise on Peterson's proposed dual-mode buses to serve suburban commuters where trolleybuses were not feasible. The Metro Council approved the downtown bus tunnel by a unanimous vote on November 3, 1983, estimating a cost of $300 million to build a five-station tunnel under 3rd Avenue and Pine Street to be completed in 1989 along with the conversion of 3rd Avenue into a landscaped <b>transit</b> <b>mall.</b>|$|E
5|$|The DSTT enters Westlake station under Pine Street between 3rd and 6th avenues, {{located between}} the Westlake Center {{shopping}} mall and Westlake Park. The station features a two-block-long mezzanine with exits to Pine Street and several retailers, including the Westlake Center, Macy's {{in the former}} The Bon Marché flagship store, and the headquarters of Nordstrom, {{as well as the}} King County Metro customer service center. The area around the station is known as the Westlake Hub, with connections to the South Lake Union Streetcar and the Seattle Center Monorail as well as the King County Metro and Sound Transit buses. Leaving Westlake Station, the tunnel turns south under Century Square to follow 3rd Avenue and its <b>transit</b> <b>mall</b> through the central business district, parallel to the shoreline of Elliott Bay.|$|E
25|$|In {{parts of}} the MAX system, {{particularly}} in central Portland and Hillsboro, MAX trains run on surface streets. Except on the Portland <b>Transit</b> <b>Mall,</b> trains run in reserved lanes closed to other motorized vehicles. On the <b>Transit</b> <b>Mall,</b> trains operate on the same lanes as TriMet buses (although MAX trains have traffic priority). Elsewhere, MAX runs within its own exclusive right-of-way, in street medians, alongside freeways, and on former freight railroad lines.|$|E
50|$|In North America, the {{creation}} of pedestrian-friendly urban environments {{is still in its}} infancy, but <b>transit</b> <b>malls</b> have existed in a few cities for more than 40 years, starting with the Nicollet Mall in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1968, followed by the Granville Mall in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1974 and the Portland Mall in 1977. In North America, <b>transit</b> <b>malls</b> usually take the form of single streets in which automobiles are mostly prohibited but transit vehicles are allowed. They are rarely completely free of motor vehicles. Often, all of the cross streets are open to motorized traffic, and in some cases taxis are allowed and truck deliveries are made by night.|$|R
5000|$|The Portland <b>Transit</b> <b>Mall's</b> {{northbound}} {{lines on}} 6th Avenue {{connect to the}} MAX along {{the east side of}} Pioneer Square. Southbound lines are on 5th Avenue, and can be accessed at the next eastbound station as well.|$|R
50|$|Bus-only lanes {{make for}} faster travel {{and ensure that}} buses are not delayed by mixed traffic congestion. Separate rights of way may be elevated, in a cutting, or in a tunnel, {{possibly}} using former rail routes. <b>Transit</b> <b>malls</b> or 'bus streets' may also be created in city centers.|$|R
25|$|This {{proposed}} future route {{would cross}} the downtown core {{at right angles}} to the downtown <b>transit</b> <b>mall</b> and connect two new legs: the Southeast leg and the North-Central leg. It would exceed the capacity of the downtown <b>transit</b> <b>mall,</b> requiring that it use a new right of way going over or under the existing <b>transit</b> <b>mall.</b> Elevated tracks would conflict with Calgary's downtown +15 system, which is the most extensive pedestrian skywalk system in the world, so this option is unlikely. Most likely the system will go underground, crossing underneath the future downtown subway, which already has a short section of tunnel built under 8th Avenue S and a ghost station under the Calgary Municipal Building. The exact routes and station locations are currently in the planning stages.|$|E

25|$|Fifth and Sixth avenues within {{downtown}} {{comprise the}} Portland <b>Transit</b> <b>Mall,</b> two streets devoted primarily to bus and light rail traffic with limited automobile access. Opened in 1977 for buses, the <b>transit</b> <b>mall</b> was renovated and rebuilt in 2007–09, with light rail added. Starting in 1975 and lasting nearly four decades, all transit service within downtown Portland was free, the area being known by TriMet as Fareless Square, but {{a need for}} minor budget cuts and funding needed for expansion prompted the agency to limit free rides to rail service only in 2010, and subsequently to discontinue the fare-free zone entirely in 2012.|$|E

25|$|Hansen's Winter Rider No. 2 (2003) was {{installed}} on the <b>Transit</b> <b>Mall,</b> {{at the intersection of}} Southwest Sixth Avenue and Taylor Street, in February 2010. It was previously installed at the Public Service Building.|$|E
25|$|The City of Dallas and MATA worked {{together}} to further expand the streetcar system past the southern terminus further into downtown. The plan was for a line to split off from the current line at McKinney and Olive Streets and travel down Olive to the light rail <b>transit</b> <b>mall</b> downtown near Pearl Station.|$|E
25|$|Rosny Park <b>Transit</b> <b>Mall</b> {{serves as}} the hub for Metro Tasmania bus {{transportation}} within the city, which is the primary provider of public transportation in Clarence. Bus routes reach almost all major residential areas within the city. Ferry services operates services between Bellerive Quay and Sullivans Cove at peak times on weekdays.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{located on}} Fifth Avenue, the {{sculpture}} was reinstalled {{on the mall}} in 2009 at a different location, on SW Sixth Avenue between Alder and Morrison, where it remains. According to TriMet, Kvinneakt is one of 40 public art sculptures in the <b>Transit</b> <b>Mall's</b> art collection. The sculpture {{is part of the}} City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the Regional Arts & Culture Council and is administered by the City of Portland Metropolitan Arts Commission.|$|R
25|$|LRT cost {{efficiency}} improves dramatically as ridership increases, {{as can be}} seen from the numbers above: the same rail line, with similar capital and operating costs, is far more efficient if it is carrying 20,000 people per hour than if it is carrying 2,400. The Calgary, Alberta, C-Train used many common light rail techniques to keep costs low, including minimizing underground and elevated trackage, sharing <b>transit</b> <b>malls</b> with buses, leasing rights-of-way from freight railroads, and combining LRT construction with freeway expansion. As a result, Calgary ranks toward the less expensive end of the scale with capital costs of around $24 million per mile.|$|R
50|$|In North America, where a more {{commonly}} used term is pedestrian mall, such areas are still in their infancy. Few cities have pedestrian zones, but some have pedestrianized single streets. Some cities have <b>transit</b> <b>malls.</b> Many pedestrian streets are surfaced with cobblestones, or pavement bricks, thus discouraging any kind of wheeled traffic, including wheelchairs. They are rarely completely free of motor vehicles. Often, all of the cross streets are open to motorized traffic, which thus intrudes on the pedestrian flow at every street corner. In a few pedestrian streets with no cross street cars or trucks, deliveries are made by trucks by night.|$|R
25|$|On 16 May 2011, Washington Avenue {{just east}} of the bridge was {{permanently}} closed to personal motor vehicle traffic. The roadway was converted into an exclusive use <b>transit</b> <b>mall</b> between Pleasant and Walnut Streets, so all eastbound lower-level traffic other than buses and emergency vehicles must exit to East River Parkway/Delaware Street and the only westbound access to the bridge for most cars will be from Pleasant Street Southeast.|$|E
25|$|The system {{currently}} has {{a total of}} 97 stations. Of these, 51 stations are served by the Blue Line, 28 stations by the Green Line, 17 by the Orange Line, 29 by the Red Line, and 17 by the Yellow Line, with 39 stations served by two or more lines and 8 by three. The system's central stations are at Pioneer Courthouse Square, on the Portland <b>Transit</b> <b>Mall.</b> All lines except for the Orange Line pass through the Rose Quarter and cross the Steel Bridge.|$|E
25|$|Arrival {{information}} screens are {{in place}} at all stations on the Green Line and <b>Transit</b> <b>Mall,</b> with reader boards on the Yellow Line and some Red Line stations. These show arrival countdowns for trains and information about any service disruptions. After a $180,000 grant from the Federal Transit Administration, TriMet began adding digital displays to Blue and Red Line stations in 2013, initially on the west side, {{and then on the}} east side. All MAX stations are expected to be fitted with screens by 2016.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of the}} {{construction}} of the original Route 201 South line, nine single-platform stations were built along the 7th Avenue South <b>transit</b> <b>mall,</b> which formed the 7th Avenue free fare zone. All nine stations opened May 25, 1981 along with the original South Line. The tracks run at grade in a semi-exclusive right of way, shared with buses, city and emergency vehicles. This is a free-fare zone intended to act as a downtown people mover. Fares are only required after trains exit the downtown core.|$|E
25|$|The City of San Bernardino is {{a member}} of the joint-powers {{authority}} Omnitrans, and downtown is a major transfer point in the local bus system. Buses primarily serve the 4th Street <b>Transit</b> <b>Mall,</b> and provide local service throughout the region, as well as express service to Riverside. A Bus Rapid Transit project, called sbX, is planned from Cal State San Bernardino to Loma Linda. A bus transit center is under construction in the vicinity of E Street and Rialto Avenue. There is also the MARTA bus which takes people directly from downtown to the communities in the San Bernardino Mountains.|$|E
25|$|The longer route (Red Line; 35km long) {{serves the}} {{southern}} and northwestern {{areas of the}} city. The shorter route (Blue Line; 25.7km long) serves the northeastern and western sections of the city. Most track is at grade, with its own right-of-way. The downtown portion is a shared right-of-way, serving both routes along the 7th Avenue South <b>transit</b> <b>mall</b> at street level. This portion is a zero-fare zone {{and serves as a}} downtown people mover. The tracks split at the east and west ends of downtown into lines leading to the south, northeast, west and northwest residential neighbourhoods of Calgary. Six percent of the system is underground, and seven percent is grade-separated (elevated). Trains are powered by overhead electric wires, using pantographs to draw power.|$|E

25|$|The Metro system's {{rail lines}} use a {{combination}} of exclusive and shared right-of-way, depending on the circumstances. Within the two Downtown Zones, trains run on surface streets in an exclusive right-of-way, without preemption. The Blue Line runs primarily alongside Hiawatha Avenue (Minnesota State Highway 55), along land originally acquired for expansion of that highway, except for a brief stretch in a tunnel underneath Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. The Green Line runs along the median of University Avenue in an exclusive right-of-way, except for a brief stretch of the Washington Avenue <b>Transit</b> <b>Mall</b> where its tracks are shared with buses. The Blue Line's at-grade crossings are protected by automated grade crossing gates; the Green Line's crossings move in regular traffic, with signal priority but no preemption.|$|E
500|$|Kvinneakt ("female nude" [...] in Norwegian) is an {{abstract}} bronze sculpture {{located on the}} <b>Transit</b> <b>Mall</b> of downtown Portland, Oregon. Designed and created by Norman J. Taylor between 1973 and 1975, the work was funded by TriMet and the United States Department of Transportation and was installed on the <b>Transit</b> <b>Mall</b> in 1977. [...] The following year Kvinneakt appeared in the [...] "Expose Yourself to Art" [...] poster which featured future Mayor of Portland Bud Clark flashing the sculpture. It remained in place until November 2006 when it was removed temporarily during renovation of the <b>Transit</b> <b>Mall</b> and {{the installation of the}} MAX Light Rail on the mall.|$|E
500|$|At its east end, the United States National Bank Building stands {{directly}} across 6th Avenue from another A. E. Doyle-designed bank building, the Bank of California Building, of 1925.

[...] The northbound Portland <b>Transit</b> <b>Mall</b> passes {{in front of the}} building's east end, and during the mall's construction in 1976–77 the plain concrete sidewalk there was resurfaced in brick, and street trees were added. MAX light rail trains have passed in front of the building's east end on 6th Avenue since 2009, following a 2007–08 rebuilding of the <b>transit</b> <b>mall.</b>|$|E

40|$|Urban {{land use}} (also known as spatial {{planning}} or urban form) {{has a big}} influence and impact on the way transport systems are planned and managed in large cities. In Kampala for example, transport systems are largely inefficient because of the failure by the city authorities to adopt an integrated approach towards land use and transport planning. Due to a multifarious and complex land tenure system, the provision of roads and other transportrelated infrastructure such as parking facilities and bus terminals has become virtually impossible. This paper examines the impact of land use on transport planning in Kampala {{in view of the}} city’s recent experience. It also draws lessons from the experiences of the role model cities in Asia. To address key transportation challenges such as rapid motorization and traffic jam, it is critical that land use-based strategies such as <b>transit</b> <b>malls,</b> land value capture, constructing high density buildings (both commercial and residential) along the transit lines as well as establishing park and ride facilities are adopted by the urban managers and city policy makers...|$|R
