25|$|In-stream <b>tidal</b> <b>turbine</b> {{technology}} is a relatively simple design. An elevated turbine is submerged under water in a location that enables its movement with tidal cycles. As the blades of the turbine move they create energy that powers an electric generator at the base. From here the power travels to a cable attached to the seafloor and back to an offsite facility {{where it can be}} added to the power grid.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "world's first community-owned {{tidal power}} generator" [...] became {{operational}} in Bluemull Sound off Yell, Shetland in early 2014. This 30kW Nova Innovation device feeds {{into the local}} grid, and [...] a 100kW <b>tidal</b> <b>turbine</b> was connected in August 2016. At {{the opposite end of}} the country a 2010 consultants' report into the possibility of a scheme involving the construction of a Solway Barrage, possibly south of Annan, concluded that the plans [...] "would be expensive and environmentally sensitive."

40|$|<b>Tidal</b> stream <b>turbines</b> have {{generated}} significant research interests {{due to their}} major advantages over some other forms of renewable generation. As this technology is relatively new, deployment of <b>tidal</b> <b>turbines</b> is hindered by various problems. <b>Tidal</b> <b>turbines</b> see a non-uniform incoming flow in most situations. This causes differences in power generation and loading at different positions in the rotation of a turbine blade, which affects turbine performance and downstream fluid dynamics. This paper shows {{the development of a}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model which is currently being used to study such effects. Discussions on the effect of node counts and clustering on mesh independence, along with a study identifying the appropriate turbulence models for the corresponding flow condition will be covered. Findings were validated with experimental data, and used to construct a complete CFD model which is currently being used to study the effect of a non-uniform velocity profile over turbine performance, loading on turbine blades, and wake. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{conditions}} under which cavitation may affect the operation of horizontal axis <b>tidal</b> <b>turbines.</b> The approach utilises computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to measure the individual and combined influence that operational parameters, including flow velocity, rotor angular velocity, and depth of submersion exert on the operation of a 3 bladed turbine. The approach is based upon the behaviour developed within a CFD model allowing the comparison of the minimum local pressure to fluid vapour pressures. It must be stated that the inception of cavitation may be a complex process. This approach thus assumes that when local fluid pressure drops below the vapour pressure cavitation will ensue. The result of this analysis suggests that, given specific conditions, it is highly likely that <b>tidal</b> <b>turbines</b> will be subject to the effects of cavitation...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tidal</b> <b>turbines</b> {{and wave}} energy devices may affect seabird populations through {{collision}} mortality, disturbance and habitat loss. Given the pressures to harness tidal and wave energy, especially in Scottish waters, {{there is an}} urgent need to assess population-level impacts on seabird species. With a lack of deployed devices to monitor in areas of importance for seabirds, our approach uses data from scientific literature on seabird ecology and conservation importance likely to influence population vulnerability to “wet renewables” in Scottish waters. At this stage however, we can only infer likely interactions with tidal and wave devices. We identify black guillemot, razorbill, European shag, common guillemot, great cormorant, divers and Atlantic puffin as the species most vulnerable to adverse effects from <b>tidal</b> <b>turbines</b> in Scottish waters. We identify divers as the species most vulnerable to adverse effects from wave energy devices in Scottish waters. Wave energy devices seem likely to represent a lesser hazard to seabirds than <b>tidal</b> <b>turbines,</b> and both forms of energy capture seem likely to represent a lower hazard to seabirds than offshore wind farms (wind-power plants). The indices developed here for Scottish seabird populations {{could be applied to}} populations elsewhere. This approach will help in identifying likely impacts of tidal and wave energy deployments on seabirds, and in optimizing deployment of resources for compulsory environmental monitoring...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} focused on {{diffuser}} augmented <b>tidal</b> current <b>turbines</b> that capture the kinetic energy in a tidal stream. The energy that can be extracted from tides {{is proportional to the}} cube of the current velocity. The role of the diffuser in diffuser augmented <b>tidal</b> <b>turbines</b> is to help accelerate the incoming current velocity. Consequently, the efficiency of the turbine can be significantly increased by using a diffuser. The research community is investing considerable time and financial resources in this growing domain. The diffuser augmented <b>tidal</b> <b>turbines</b> research data is rather scarce due to their emerging nature, large and costly research and development setup, startup cost and proprietary issues. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effect of length and angle on NACA 0018 airfoil for diffuser design. CFD simulation is carried out to investigate velocity and mass flow rate at the throat. The drag force due to diffuser installation is also calculated. Velocity inside the diffuser increases with diffuser length and angle of attack. Velocity increases up to stall angle and then drops due to flow separation. The drag force is also dominant compared to lift coefficient near stall angle region...|$|R
