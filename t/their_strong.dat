5|$|General {{relativity}} {{has developed}} into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides {{the foundation for}} the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where the gravitational effect is so strong that even light cannot escape. <b>Their</b> <b>strong</b> gravity is thought to be responsible for the intense radiation emitted by certain types of astronomical objects (such as active galactic nuclei or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology.|$|E
5|$|In Star Wars and History {{published}} by Lucasfilm, it describes Palpatine's consolidation of power as being {{similar to the}} Roman political figure Augustus, named Octavian before renaming himself.

Their habit of wedging a large food item in a crevice and then hacking at it with <b>their</b> <b>strong</b> bills gives this group its English name.|$|E

5|$|A 1–0 {{victory against}} Coventry City meant Arsenal were five points behind Sheffield Wednesday, who lay in third spot.

The team, without the suspended Wright for the trip to Sheffield United came away from Bramall Lane with a point.

Arsenal ended the league campaign with a 5–1 win against Southampton at home.

5|$|As {{described}} by quantum chromodynamics, {{the strong interaction between}} quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part {{of a more}} general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, <b>their</b> <b>strong</b> interaction is preserved.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1944, the M3 {{had fallen}} out of favor even with {{airborne}} troops, despite <b>their</b> <b>strong</b> preference for compact and lightweight weapon systems. The Airborne Command had rejected the 57mm M1 in the summer of 1943 claiming its unfitness for airlifting and the Table of Organisation and Equipment (TO) of February 1944 still had airborne divisions keeping their 37mm guns. Nevertheless, the 82nd and the 101st, were reequipped with British-manufactured 6-pounder gun (57mm) on carriage Mk III (designed to fit into the British Horsa glider) for the Normandy airdrops. This change was officially introduced in the TO of December 1944.|$|E

5|$|Callaway {{said he was}} {{surprised}} by UPN's cancellation of Mercy Point because of <b>their</b> <b>strong</b> support of the show. He felt {{the decision was made}} {{in part because of the}} show's high production costs. He also concluded that the decision to broadcast the pilot at the same time as the World Series resulted in the loss of Mercy Points target audience. To better connect with UPN's teen viewers, Callaway shifted the show's focus from medical and ethical cases to the characters' relationships. Despite these revisions, he said that UPN executives preferred to air shows like Moesha over science-fiction programs. When UPN announced the show's cancellation, the eighth episode was in the middle of production. Scenes originally written for the episode were revised and edited into the seventh episode to form a complete series finale.|$|E
5|$|Due to NIAA rules {{which require}} a {{transfer}} student {{to wait a}} year before participating in athletic activities, Randall II was required to sit out his sophomore year in both football and track and field at Bishop Gorman. Then, he backed up four-time state champion starting quarterback Anu Solomon as a junior. That season, he compiled 298 {{yards and two touchdowns}} on 2132 passing with four interceptions and added 42 rushes for 483 yards and seven touchdowns. By his junior year, his 40-yard dash speed was laser-timed at 4.6 seconds. As a senior, he inherited a team that Solomon had led to four consecutive state championships. Despite not starting until his senior season, he entered the year with football scholarship offers from Mississippi State, LSU, Baylor, Syracuse, Arizona State, Utah and UNLV. USA Today predicted that Baylor and LSU may be favorites because of <b>their</b> <b>strong</b> track programs.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rest}} of the decade, the club won the league just once more in 1966–67. However, the 1970s saw Juventus further solidify <b>their</b> <b>strong</b> {{position}} in Italian football.

During {{the rest of}} the decade, they won the league twice more, with defender Gaetano Scirea contributing significantly. The later win was under Giovanni Trapattoni, who also led the club to their first ever major European title (the UEFA Cup) in 1977 and helped the club's domination continue on into {{the early part of the}} 1980s. During Trapattoni's tenure, many Juventus players also formed the backbone of the Italy national team during Enzo Bearzot's successful managerial era, including the 1978 World Cup, UEFA Euro 1980 and 1982 world champion squads.|$|E
