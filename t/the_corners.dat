5|$|As all lens systems, natural {{vignetting}} (gradual {{reduction of}} an image's brightness {{from the center}} towards the periphery) is present due to Lambert's cosine law – this becomes more pronounced at shorter focal lengths. Wide open at 8mm, about 0.75 EVs of shading are apparent at <b>the</b> <b>corners,</b> while at 16mm only about 0.25 EV of shading is noticeable when comparing <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> to the center. For most of the focal length range of the lens, there is between a half stop and third stop of corner shading. Alternatively, stopping down to higher f-numbers lessens vignetting.|$|E

5|$|The {{copper shark}} has a slender, {{streamlined}} {{body with a}} slightly arched profile just behind the head. The snout is rather long and pointed, with the nostrils preceded by low flaps of skin. The round, moderately large eyes are equipped with nictating membranes (protective third eyelids). The mouth has short, subtle furrows at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> and contains 29–35 upper tooth rows and 29–33 lower tooth rows. The teeth are serrated with single narrow cusps; the upper teeth have a distinctive hooked shape and become more angled towards <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> of the jaw, while the lower teeth are upright. The upper teeth of adult males are longer, narrower, more curved, and more finely serrated than those of adult females and juveniles. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly long.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} twenty-nine monumental brick or stone-carved pillar-gates (que) from the Han dynasty have survived {{and can be}} found in the {{aboveground}} areas around Han tomb and shrine sites.

Although they lack wooden and ceramic components, they feature imitation roof tiles, eaves, porches, and balustrades.|$|E

However, practice showed that lap times actually slowed due to changes to the kerbs, forcing the drivers {{to stay away from the}} insides of <b>the</b> <b>corners.</b> Pirelli chose the soft and medium compounds for the event.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to study the effect of various parameters on <b>the</b> <b>cornering</b> forces produced by a rolling aircraft tire installed on a tilted, free-swiveling nose gear. The parameters studied included tilt angle, trial, tire inflation pressure, rake angle, vertical load, {{and whether or not}} a twin tire configuration corotates. These parameters were evaluated by measuring <b>the</b> <b>cornering</b> force produced by an aircraft tire installed on the nose gear of a modified vehicle as it was towed slowly. Cornering force coefficient increased with increasing tilt angle. Increasing trial or rake angle decreased the magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>cornering</b> force coefficient. Tire inflation pressure had no effect on <b>the</b> <b>cornering</b> force coefficient. Increasing vertical load decreased <b>the</b> <b>cornering</b> force coefficient. When the tires of a twin tire system rotated independently, <b>the</b> <b>cornering</b> force coefficients were the same as those for the single-tire configuration. When the twin tire system was made to corotate, however, <b>the</b> <b>cornering</b> force coefficients increased significantly...|$|R

5|$|Ahead of {{the failed}} Nordic bid to host the Euro 2008, Lerkendal was, along with Ullevaal Stadion, {{proposed}} as Norwegian venues. To reach the required spectator capacity of 30,000 seats, the plans called for {{the roof of the}} Adidas stand to be removed to allow for a temporary third tier. Additional seating would be created by adding a single row {{at the bottom of the}} four stands, and building capacity in <b>the</b> <b>corners.</b> The proposal would have given a spectator capacity of 30,849, although it would have been reduced after the championship by removing the extra tier. Similar plans were launched for the Norwegian–Swedish bid for Euro 2016, where the cost of the stadium upgrades was estimated at NOK800 million. In 2007, the club management stated that they wanted to sell out all matches before they made further expansions to the stadium, independent of the plans to host the Euro. Construction of stands in <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> could give 4,000 additional seats, although these would be the most costly to build and at the same time give the worst view of the pitch. Construction could be done by first building two of <b>the</b> <b>corners.</b> Since then, Rosenborg has experienced a significant drop in attendance. The failed Trondheim bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics, launched in 2007, called for Lerkendal to be the Olympic Stadium and host the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E

However, by fitting a curve with the wider radius through <b>the</b> <b>corner,</b> <b>the</b> higher average speed which can be maintained more than compensates for the extra distance travelled.|$|R
5|$|In 1909, Holden won {{the design}} {{competition}} for an extension to the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Subsequently {{dedicated to the}} memory of King Edward VII (died 1910), the extension (1911–12) was built on steeply sloping ground for which Holden designed a linked pair of Portland stone-faced blocks around a courtyard. The plain, abstract blocks have towers on <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> and two-storey loggias, and are a further simplification of Holden's style.|$|E
