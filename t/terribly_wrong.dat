500|$|The {{existence}} of the band itself caused a debate in the metal underground. For example, during the early 1990s, Bård Faust of Emperor brought up the subject when he discussed with Euronymous, guitarist/vocalist from the seminal black metal band Mayhem, in his zine Orcustus about the Norwegian scene. Faust asked: [...] "Don't you think that something is <b>terribly</b> <b>wrong</b> when it {{has gone so far}} that we have a Christian [...] "death metal" [...] band here (Crush Evil)? Any advice on how we should kill them?" [...] Euronymous replied to this: [...] "It's bad enough to have a couple of society bands, but a Christian band is too much. But don't worry, we have plans. They will not continue for a very long time." [...] However, the band persevered despite these threats. Antestor was never forced to split apart, and in an almost ironic twist of fate, Jan Axel Blomberg (better known as Hellhammer, the drummer for Mayhem) was Antestor's session drummer on their latest two releases.|$|E

Keyboardist Tony Brown {{remembers the}} singer's arrival at a University of Maryland concert: [...] "He {{fell out of}} the limousine, to his knees.

It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something <b>terribly</b> <b>wrong</b> with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible.... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions". Wilkinson recounted that a few nights later in Detroit, [...] "I watched him in his dressing room, just draped over a chair, unable to move. So often I thought, 'Boss, why don't you just cancel this tour and take a year off...?' I mentioned something once in a guarded moment. He patted me on the back and said, 'It'll be all right. Don't you worry about it.'" [...] Presley continued to play to sellout crowds.|$|E
500|$|Season four {{begins with}} Buffy and Willow {{starting}} college, attending U.C. Sunnydale, while Xander {{works at a}} series of odd jobs and begins dating Anya Jenkins (Emma Caulfield), who lived for 1,100 years as a vengeance demon before losing her powers and getting stuck {{in the body of}} a teenager. In the fourth season, Willow becomes romantically involved with fellow-student Tara Maclay (Amber Benson), an experienced witch. The Big Bad in season four {{is the result of the}} work of a covert military force called [...] "The Initiative" [...] who are capturing and performing experiments on vampires and demons in Sunnydale. Buffy and her friends discover that chief amongst these experiments is the creation of a human-cyber-demonoid hybrid known as Adam (George Hertzberg), whose programming has gone <b>terribly</b> <b>wrong,</b> leading him to wreak havoc on the town. Buffy's challenge is to find a way to disempower him, something she and the Scoobies achieve in the penultimate episode of season four, [...] "Primeval". In order to do this, the four magically join their essences together to create a single [...] "super Slayer"; while the others perform a ritual, Buffy confronts and defeats Adam while mystically empowered with Giles' mind, Xander's heart, and Willow's spirit aiding her. The ritual employs four tarot-like cards: Manus (meaning hands or strength) represents Buffy, Sophus (meaning teacher or wise) represents Giles, Animus (meaning courage, or heart) represents Xander, and Spiritus (meaning spirit and magical power) represents Willow. These symbols will become relevant to the central motif in each of the episode's four dream sequences.|$|E

Karl has cheated on Susan twice with Sarah Beaumont (Nicola Charles) and Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) {{and the couple}} have broken up and divorced, but have later reunited and remarried. Woodburne has named the Karl, Susan and Izzy love triangle {{as one of her}} favourite storylines. Woodburne believes that Karl and Susan have a strong connection that is [...] "based upon such a good grounding". Karl and Susan are best friends who enjoy each other's company, share a deep connection and take joy in each other's quirks and ways. Woodburne described them as having a [...] "really solid foundation for a marriage" [...] and she has said that she does not want to see Susan and Karl's relationship break up again. Holy Soap have called Susan and Karl [...] "contenders for the friskiest couple on Ramsay Street". Following their [...] "passionate arguments", the couple enjoy making up together. They have a healthy attraction for each other. Fletcher says he and Woodburne find the scenes [...] "funny". Fletcher said [...] "Karl and Susan every now and again do go through a phase where they become slightly more amorous than in their tougher times and tougher storylines – suffice to say it's not bawdy, but I think the audience will enjoy the fun aspect". Karl and Susan have been caught in the nude together on three occasions; at the beach, in Lou Carpenter's (Tom Oliver) spa and when they went skinny-dipping in the bush. When asked what makes Karl and Susan popular with viewers, Woodburne said [...] "Because I think they're so flawed. There's two things: they make horrendous mistakes, both of them, but they both are coming from a place of well meaning.

As Diana was not musical, and therefore under no compliment to Mrs. Green, she kept out of the way. Mr. Mason also was absent. He knew that something very mean was about to be done, and would not show his face till it was over. He ought to have taken the matter in hand himself, and would have done so had not his mind been full of other things. He himself was a man <b>terribly</b> <b>wronged</b> and wickedly injured, and could not therefore in these present months interfere much in the active doing of kindnesses. His hours were spent in thinking how he might best obtain justice,--how he might secure his pound of flesh.

500|$|On March 28, 2014, Blount {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with the Pittsburgh Steelers. On August 20, 2014, Blount and fellow Steeler running back Le'Veon Bell were out cruising in Bell's Camaro with a female, when traffic officer Sean Stafiej pulled over the Camaro operated by Bell around 1:30 p.m. after Stafiej, who was on a motorcycle, noticed a strong odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle. Stafiej found a 20 gram bag of marijuana inside the car. Bell, Blount, and a female passenger all claimed ownership of the marijuana according to police. Bell, 22, {{was taken to a}} hospital to have blood drawn [...] Both Blount and Bell were arrested for marijuana possession. In addition, Bell also received a DUI. On September 7, 2014, Blount scored his first touchdown as a Steeler against the Cleveland Browns. On September 21, 2014, Blount ran for 118 yards on 10 carries and a touchdown against the Carolina Panthers. This game was the only game of the season with 100-plus yards. On November 9, 2014, Blount returned a kick-off for 21 yards and had three carries for 8 yards when he was brought on the field to punch it in on first-&-goal from the one-yard-line, down 20-6 against the New York Jets, halfway through the fourth quarter. On first down, Blount was sent to carry the ball off the left guard for no gain. The Steelers ran the very same play on second down, but the Jets were expecting it and already in the backfield before Blount even got the ball, with Blount's attempt to shake loose going <b>terribly</b> <b>wrong</b> (losing 8 yards) and leaving the Steelers facing third-&-goal from the nine-yard-line. That play marked the final time Blount would touch the ball as a Steeler. [...] On November 17, 2014, Blount left the game against the Tennessee Titans, after not getting a single touch all day for the first time all season, before the game ended (while Pittsburgh was in the [...] "victory formation"). Blount was subsequently released by the Steelers {{as a result of his}} actions. Blount finished his short-term Steelers tenure with 266 yards and two touchdowns.|$|E

Songs such as [...] "Todd's Ship Gods (Above All Things)", [...] "(We Were) Electrocute", and [...] "I Don't Wanna Be Me" [...] convey the band's classic elements of melody, though the song lengths were much shorter on this outing, the longest being the 7 and a half-minute [...] "How Could She?", a list of female character names from television shows.

50|$|Nardiello {{was born}} in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. A former world {{champion}} in the super middleweight division, he and Roy Jones Jr. are best remembered as the two boxers who were controversially robbed of decisions against eventually Olympic light middleweight gold medalist Park Si-Hun {{in the last two}} rounds of the 1988 Olympics despite Nardiello and Jones clearly landing more punches in their bouts. Two of the judges in Jones versus Si-Hun finals were banned for life after the tournament, while the third admitted his card was a mistake, with Jones being named the outstanding fighter of the tournament. Si-Hun apologized and retired. The stain of the 'bad decisions' in the 1988 Olympics stayed with Nardiello and Jones {{for the rest of their}} careers. 36 of 37 Americans got decisions in boxing in the 1984 Olympics in the United States, and the South Koreans had vowed to get back at the American media for being <b>terribly</b> <b>wronged</b> in 1984, and Nardiello and Jones were targets of the South Korean scorecards of the time. Nardiello, who lost a 3-2 split decision Park Si-Hun, felt he had been cheated, argued with the officials at ringside and had to be physically dragged from the Seoul Olympics ring area.|$|R

In 1992 he joined Irish supergroup Altan with whom he sings and plays guitar. Of his use of DADGAD tuning, Sproule says, it [...] "just seemed to instantly gel with Irish music. The nature of the tuning meant that you didn't really produce anything that was <b>terribly,</b> drastically, offensively <b>wrong</b> to people. I was always a singer, but when I started playing with instrumentalists in sessions and pubs, I was able to develop a style by just playing along with them quietly and tactfully."

40|$|In {{preparation}} for this paper, I've examined some of the available literature on water well corrosion. I find {{that much of the}} material is either <b>wrong,</b> <b>terribly</b> confusing, or else completely misses the point. For example: "When water contains less iron than the maximum that it is capable of carrying in solution, it corrodes iron or steel rapidly- unless a protective film or crust of some material covers the metal surface. The unsaturated water tends to dissolve metal from the surface of well screens, well casing or piping systems until it becomes saturated with respect to iron. If the mineral content of the water is such that a protective film is not formed by deposition of insoluble materials, severe corrosion results. " [1] This concept is true only if we are talking about metallic iron rather than ionized iron. However, the solubility of metallic iron in water is not reported in the literature, and is probably too small to measure. Serious corrosion of steel casing from the solution of metallic iron would take centuries or millenia. Corrosion experiments have not produced entirely satisfactory results. When a commerciall...|$|R

In retrospect, Sullivan said that the torture and abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq had jolted him back to [...] "sanity".

Whatever was intended, the raid went <b>terribly</b> <b>wrong</b> and many of the leading figures still at large were captured. Rhys Ddu ("Black Rhys") of Cardigan, one of Owain’s most faithful commanders, was captured and taken to London for execution. A chronicle of the time states that Rhys Ddu was: [...] "…laid on a hurdle and so drawn forth to Tyburn through the City and was there hanged and let down again.

60|$|The {{election}} on Miss Dunstable's part was lost. She {{carried on the}} contest nobly, fighting it to the last moment, and sparing neither her own money nor that of her antagonist; but she carried it on unsuccessfully. Many gentlemen did support Mr. Sowerby because they were willing enough to emancipate their county from the duke's thraldom; but Mr. Sowerby was felt {{to be a black}} sheep, as Lady Lufton had called him, and {{at the close of the}} election he found himself banished from the representation of West Barsetshire;--banished for ever, after having held the county for five-and-twenty years. Unfortunate Mr. Sowerby! I cannot take leave of him here without some feeling of regret, knowing that there was that within him which might, under better guidance, have produced better things. There are men, even of high birth, who seem as though they were born to be rogues; but Mr. Sowerby was, to my thinking, born to be a gentleman. That he had not been a gentleman--that he had bolted from his appointed course, going <b>terribly</b> on the <b>wrong</b> side of the posts--let us all acknowledge. It is not a gentleman-like deed, but a very blackguard action, to obtain a friend's acceptance to a bill in an unguarded hour of social intercourse. That and other similar doings have stamped his character too plainly. But, nevertheless, I claim a tear for Mr. Sowerby, and lament that he has failed to run his race discreetly, in accordance with the rules of the Jockey Club, He attempted that plan of living as a tenant in his old house at Chaldicotes, and of making a living out of the land which he farmed; but he soon abandoned it. He had no aptitude for such industry, and could not endure his altered position in the county. He soon relinquished Chaldicotes of his own accord, and has vanished away, as such men do vanish--not altogether without necessary income; to which point in the final arrangement of their joint affairs, Mrs. Thornes's man of business--if I may be allowed so far to anticipate--paid special attention. And thus Lord Dumbello, the duke's nominee, got in, as the duke's nominee had done for very many years past. There was no Nemesis here--none as yet. Nevertheless, she with the lame foot will assuredly catch him, the duke, if it be that he deserve to be caught. With us his grace's appearance has been so unfrequent that I think we may omit to make any further inquiry as to his concerns.|$|R

They decided that the sensational aspects of the case that so titillated newspaper readers in 1954 were {{far removed from the}} story that Jackson and Walsh wished to tell. [...] "In the 1950s, Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme were branded as possibly the most evil people on earth. What they had done seemed without rational explanation, and people could only assume that there was something <b>terribly</b> <b>wrong</b> with their minds," [...] states Jackson. To bring a more humane version of events to the screen, the filmmakers undertook a nationwide search for people who had close involvement with Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme forty years earlier. This included tracing and interviewing seventeen of their former classmates and teachers from Christchurch Girls' High School. In addition, Jackson and Walsh spoke with neighbours, family friends, colleagues, policemen, lawyers and psychologists. Jackson and Walsh also read Pauline's diary, in which she made daily entries documenting her friendship with Juliet Hulme and events throughout their relationship. From the diary entries, it became apparent that Pauline and Juliet were intelligent, imaginative, outcast young women who possessed a wicked and somewhat irreverent sense of humor. All of Pauline's voice-overs are excerpts from her journal entries.|$|E
