The next people to publish a related idea were Maryanska and Osmólska, who realized that like modern lizards, dinosaurs could have possessed salt glands, and cooled off by osmo-regulation.

Aristotle's method, too, resembled the style of science used by modern biologists when exploring a new area, with systematic data collection, discovery of patterns, and inference of possible causal explanations from these. He did not perform experiments in the modern sense, but made observations of living animals and carried out dissections. He names some 500 species of bird, mammal, and fish; and he distinguishes dozens of insects and other invertebrates. He describes the internal anatomy of over a hundred animals, and dissected around 35 of these.|$|E
5|$|Mammalian coats are colored for {{a variety}} of reasons, the major {{selective}} pressures including camouflage, sexual selection, communication and physiological processes such as <b>temperature</b> <b>regulation.</b> Camouflage is a powerful influence in a large number of mammals, as it helps to conceal individuals from predators or prey. Aposematism, warning off possible predators, is the most likely explanation of the black-and-white pelage of many mammals which are able to defend themselves, such as in the foul-smelling skunk and the powerful and aggressive honey badger. In arctic and subarctic mammals such as the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), stoat (Mustela erminea), and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), seasonal color change between brown in summer and white in winter is driven largely by camouflage. Differences in female and male coat color may indicate nutrition and hormone levels, important in mate selection. Some arboreal mammals, notably primates and marsupials, have shades of violet, green, or blue skin on parts of their bodies, indicating some distinct advantage in their largely arboreal habitat due to convergent evolution. The green coloration of sloths, however, {{is the result of a}} symbiotic relationship with algae. Coat color is sometimes sexually dimorphic, as in many primate species. Coat color may influence the ability to retain heat, depending on how much light is reflected. Mammals with a darker colored coat can absorb more heat from solar radiation, and stay warmer, and some smaller mammals, such as voles, have darker fur in the winter. The white, pigmentless fur of arctic mammals, such as the polar bear, may reflect more solar radiation directly onto the skin.|$|E

40|$|The last {{decades have}} {{witnessed}} an upsurge of neuropeptide research. These substances regulate or influence various functions like appetite, water intake, learning and memory, adaptive responses to environmental stress, thermoregulation and fever, social behavior, sleep, etc. One function {{may be affected}} by several peptides, and a single peptide can be involved in different functions – a general approach {{is to find a}} coordinated pattern, which appears “meaningful ” in explaining how a given peptide may participate in complex events. Orexins (hypocretins) have originally been described as peptides regulating feeding behavior (30) and as neuroexcitatory substances setting the threshold for arousal (6). These two functions might be related, possibly offering a pattern (alertness is a natural precondition of feeding), but they might as well be unrelated. While food intake regulation is an integral component of the overall energy balance (together with metabolic rate and body <b>temperature</b> <b>regulations)</b> (34), not necessarily all factors of energy balance are coupled with the regulation of sleep-wake behavior, even if feeding behavior and arousal state prove to be related.

25|$|Scientific {{opinion about}} the life-style, {{metabolism}} and <b>temperature</b> <b>regulation</b> of dinosaurs has varied over time since the discovery of dinosaurs in the mid-19th century. The activity of metabolic enzymes varies with temperature, so temperature control is vital for any organism, whether endothermic or ectothermic. Organisms can be categorized as poikilotherms (poikilo– changing), which are tolerant of internal temperature fluctuations, and homeotherms (homeo– same), which must maintain a constant core temperature.

25|$|All adaptations help organisms {{survive in}} their {{ecological}} niches. The adaptive traits may be structural, behavioral or physiological.

Physiological adaptations can permit the organism to perform special functions (for instance, making venom, secreting slime, phototropism), but may also involve more general functions such as growth and development, <b>temperature</b> <b>regulation,</b> ionic balance and other aspects of homeostasis. Adaptation affects all aspects of the life of an organism.|$|E
25|$|African penguin females remain fertile for 10 years. African {{penguins}} {{spend most}} of their lives at sea until it comes time for them to lay their eggs. Due to the high predation by larger mammals on the mainland, the penguins will go offshore to an island for protection from mammals and natural challenges. African penguins usually breed during the African winter when temperatures are lower. Ideally, eggs are incubated in a burrow dug into the guano layer, which provides a suitable <b>temperature</b> <b>regulation,</b> but the widespread human removal of guano deposits has rendered this type of nest unfeasible at most colonies. To compensate, penguins dig holes in the sand, breed in the open, or make use of nest boxes if such are provided. The penguins spend three weeks on land to provide for their offspring, after which chicks may be left alone during the day while the parents forage. The eggs are three to four times bigger than hen’s eggs. Parents usually feed hatchlings during dusk or dawn.|$|E
40|$|In cold inhabiting bacteria, a {{commonly}} used strategy to combat freezing stress is {{the production of}} antifreeze proteins. These proteins assist in survival below 0 degrees Celsius by minimizing extracellular ice crystal growth. With a temperature dependent activity, these proteins are regulated by changes in ambient temperature. In the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida GR 12 - 2, expression of antifreeze protein AfpA was previously observed to be regulated by cold induction at 5 degrees Celsius. To better understand how this antifreeze protein helps with low temperature survival, I investigated AfpA regulation at multiple levels. Transcriptional regulation of this protein was investigated by studying the DNA upstream of the antifreeze gene. Within this region, an RpoD promoter with a CspA regulation element was found. Using an indirect luciferase reporter gene assay, the afpA promoter {{was found to be}} most active during exponential growth under optimal conditions. From these results, <b>temperature</b> dependent <b>regulation</b> was determined to be at the posttranscriptional level. At this level, I determined that AfpA expression was likely regulated by formation of different RNA structures. From a phylogenetic analysis, I also determined that afpA may be regulated as an operon with multiple promoters that can individually regulate each gene. Aside from <b>temperature</b> dependent <b>regulation,</b> I further characterized AfpA. This protein was identified to have ice recrystallization inhibition activity, a putative ice binding site and is likely secreted by a type I secretion system. 4 month...|$|R
