25|$|The initial diesel models {{used the}} M51 straight-six <b>turbo-diesel</b> engine. In 1998, its {{successor}} the M57 was introduced, however the M51 also remained in production {{for two more}} years. In 1999, the M47 four-cylinder <b>turbo-diesel</b> {{was introduced in the}} 520d model, which is the only E39 model to use a four-cylinder engine.|$|E
25|$|The {{available}} powerplants {{were three}} twin-cam inline-four engines—the 1.8-liter 4S-FE, plus the 3S-FE and higher-performance 3S-GE 2.0-liter units. Toyota also made available the 2.0-liter 2C-T <b>turbo-diesel</b> inline-four, {{and for the}} flagship Camry Prominent only, the 2.0-liter 1VZ-FE gasoline V6.|$|E
25|$|The Range Rover Evoque, {{which went}} into {{production}} in July 2011, {{has its roots}} in the Land Rover LRX concept car; with which it bears an almost identical resemblance. It is available with either a three-door or five-door hatchback body, front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive and with a 2-litre turbocharged petrol engine or one of two different power output 2.2-litre <b>turbo-diesel</b> engines.|$|E
5000|$|Discussing {{the merits}} of <b>turbo-diesels,</b> the Glasgow Herald {{described}} the car in mid-1996 in the following way: [...] "The Citroen XM in turbo diesel form is a splendid long-legged autoroute car. [...] " [...] The same edition of the Glasgow Herald summarised the car as [...] "a fine motorway cruiser, with unexpectedly good handling around the lanes, and masses of space for passengers and luggage. [...] " ...|$|R
50|$|Instead of German engines, {{domestically}} produced 1D <b>turbo-diesels</b> were installed. Unlike {{their foreign}} counterparts, they had (for the same power) slightly higher speeds and were non-reversible. To accommodate turbocompressors and other additional systems, exhaust manifolds were enlarged and various subsystems completely redesigned. In addition, domestically produced batteries were used. The open bridge was redesigned after requests from the crews, returning to traditional closed type. Later {{in the war}} boats were equipped with a Burun-M radio director, and the radios received an upgrade. Some boats were also equipped with periscope aerials, allowing the use of radio at periscope depths, and an ASDIC was mounted {{on most of the}} boats, significantly increasing patrolling and fire efficiency.|$|R
25|$|After 25 {{years from}} the {{introduction}} of the first-generation Range Rover, the second-generation Range Rover—model-designation P38A—was introduced for the 1995 model year, with an updated version of the Rover V8 engine. There was also the option of a 2.5-litre BMW six-cylinder <b>turbo-diesel</b> with a Bosch injection pump. This was the first diesel injection with electronic controls in a Land Rover, before common rails were introduced. This was a result of BMW's subsequent ownership of Rover Group and hence the Land Rover brand. The new model offered more equipment and premium trims, positioning the vehicle above the Land Rover Discovery to face the increased competition in the SUV marketplace. This model was the last to feature the Rover V8 and interior leather supplied by Connolly who went out of business in 2002. It was the first model to feature Satellite Navigation as an option.|$|E
25|$|A 2004 MIT {{study and}} an earlier paper {{published}} by the Society of Automotive Engineers identified a method to exploit the characteristics of fuel ethanol substantially more efficiently than mixing it with gasoline. The method presents the possibility of leveraging the use of alcohol to achieve definite improvement over the cost-effectiveness of hybrid electric. The improvement consists of using dual-fuel direct-injection of pure alcohol (or the azeotrope or E85) and gasoline, in any ratio up to 100% of either, in a turbocharged, high compression-ratio, small-displacement engine having performance similar to an engine having twice the displacement. Each fuel is carried separately, with a much smaller tank for alcohol. The high-compression (for higher efficiency) engine runs on ordinary gasoline under low-power cruise conditions. Alcohol is directly injected into the cylinders (and the gasoline injection simultaneously reduced) only when necessary to suppress ‘knock’ such as when significantly accelerating. Direct cylinder injection raises the already high octane rating of ethanol up to an effective 130. The calculated over-all reduction of gasoline use and CO2 emission is 30%. The consumer cost payback time shows a 4:1 improvement over <b>turbo-diesel</b> and a 5:1 improvement over hybrid. The problems of water absorption into pre-mixed gasoline (causing phase separation), supply issues of multiple mix ratios and cold-weather starting are also avoided.|$|E

2500|$|The 2.5 diesel, 2.5 petrol and Diesel Turbo engines all {{shared the}} same block {{castings}} and other components such as valve-gear and cooling system parts, allowing them to be built on the same production line. The Diesel Turbo produced , a 13% increase over the naturally aspirated unit, and a 31.5% increase in torque to [...] at 1800rpm. Externally, <b>turbo-diesel</b> vehicles differed from other models only by having an air intake grille in the left-hand wing to supply cool air to the turbo. The engine was adopted as the standard engine for UK and European markets. Early <b>turbo-diesel</b> engines gained a reputation for poor reliability, with major failures to the bottom-end and cracked pistons. A revised block and improved big end bearings were introduced in 1988, and a re-designed breather system in 1989. These largely solved the engine's problems, but it remained (like many early turbo-diesels) prone to failure if maintenance was neglected.|$|E
2500|$|Another factory-approved {{conversion}} was the 1980 <b>turbo-diesel.</b> The [...] engines producing [...] and [...] {{of torque}} were supplied by VM Motori. Only about seven {{are thought to}} have been manufactured; two are accounted for in one of the AMC Eagle clubs. The literature for the conversions noted the cars would be equipped with larger fuel tanks, which together with diesel economy and an optional overdrive transmission, would give the cars up to [...] range. The $9,000 price tag for the conversion limited its market appeal and it was discontinued.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second round}} of the season, the 2013 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, saw Toyota debut the new 2013 {{specification}} car with one older chassis entered. After a close qualifying session, the updated No. 7 entry ran near the front of the race for the first three hours, before retiring due to overheating brakes {{as a result of a}} malfunctioning energy recovery system. With the rear brake assembly designed to be assisted with certain amounts of mechanical retardation provided by the hybrid recovery system by design, it did not provide the deceleration when malfunctioning, thus overloading the conventional rear brakes. The No. 8 sister car remained in fourth for the rest of the event, closing what was a mixed outcome for the team. Post race, technical director Pascal Vasselon explained that [...] "his team's analysis from Spa showed that the current Balance of Performance significantly favoured Audi's <b>turbo-diesel</b> engine over its own normally-aspirated petrol engine," [...] calling for the ACO and FIA for a more favourable balance of performance to be applied before Le Mans. As agreed at the season's start, theFIAand theACOreviewed the technical regulations at the end of May 2013 to adjust the performance between petrol and diesel LMP1 cars for the rest of the 2013 championship. From Le Mans onward, petrol-engine cars had an additional [...] of fuel capacity.|$|E
2500|$|More {{beneficial}} to AMC's future was {{the introduction of}} an all-new line of compact Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer models {{in the autumn of}} 1983 for the 1984 model year. The popularity of these downsized Jeeps pioneered a new market segment for what later became defined as the sport utility vehicle (SUV). They initially used the AMC 150 C.I.D. (2.5L) OHV four-cylinder engine with a carburetor, and a General Motors-built [...] carbureted V6 was optional. In 1986, throttle-body injection replaced the carburetor on the 2.5L I4 engines. A Renault [...] <b>Turbo-Diesel</b> I4 diesel was also offered. Starting with the 1987 models, a [...] I6 engine, derived from the older [...] I6 with a new head design and an electronic fuel injection system, replaced the outsourced V6. American Motors' [...] "new" [...] engine was designed with help from Renault and incorporated Renault-Bendix (Renix) parts for fuel and ignition management. The 4.0 developed an outstanding reputation for reliability and toughness. Retained by Chrysler after the buyout, the design continued to be improved and refined until its discontinuation {{at the end of the}} 2006 model year. The 4.0 engine saw extensive application in XJ Cherokees and Wagoneers, Grand Cherokees, and Wranglers, and many of those engines saw (or are seeing) extremely long lives, quite a few exceeding [...] The XJ Cherokee itself was built by Chrysler until the end of the 2001 model year in the U.S. and until 2005 in China.|$|E
2500|$|All engines now use fuel {{injection}} exclusively and were common to Camry and Vista. Entry-level customers were offered the carry-over [...] "Ci" [...] 1.8-liter 1S-i (designated 1S-iLU in the V10) inline-four with five-speed manual or an automatic with four gears. Stepping up from {{this were the}} new 3S-FE and GT high-performance 3S-GE (designated 3S-GELU for V10s) 2.0-liter twin-cam four-cylinder cars. <b>Turbo-diesel</b> models were again limited to the 2C-T motor displacing 2.0liters (labeled 2C-TL for V10s). Transmission were either a five-speed manual or an electronically controlled automatic with four gears. When launched in Japan, the V20 series Camry (sedan only) offered the following trim levels: LT, XT, XT Saloon, ZE, ZT, ZX, and GT. For the Vista sedan, Toyota offered: VC, VL, VE, VR, and VX. Hardtop versions comprised: VE, VR, VX, and GT. Flagship models of the Japanese specification Camry sedan, the Camry Prominent and Prominent G arrived in April 1987 with the 2.0-liter 1VZ-FE V6 engine, a protruding chrome grille, larger North American-type bumpers, wood grain interior highlights, an electric seat function, plus electronic instrument cluster. Full-time four-wheel-drive became an option in October 1987 with select 3S-FE manual variants (VL Extra, VR); automatics equipped with an electronic front- and rear-wheel torque distribution optimizer followed in August 1988. The Vista was not available with the V6, but in April 1987, the special edition Vista VL Extra sedan and hardtop arrived, followed by the Etoile in August and again in January 1989; limited edition Etoile V cars were offered in September 1989 and January 1990. Toyota discontinued the Vista VC in December 1989 and released a special edition VX Limited in May 1989 and then again for January 1990. When the Camry Prominent hardtop variant arrived in August 1988, it offered base, G, and E-Type levels of trim alongside a new sedan-only Camry Lumière. Also in August 1988, a diesel version of the Vista hardtop made its debut, and the 1.8-liter gasoline engine was upgraded to the twin-cam 4S-Fi specification. Special editions for the Camry comprised: Lumière S sedan (January 1989), Prominent X hardtop (May 1989), Lumière G sedan (June 1989), and XT Saloon Special sedan (January 1990). In 1988 the Japan market Camry became the first Toyota equipped with a driver airbag.|$|E
