2500|$|Later that night, at the post-fight press conference, Érik further {{explained}} his reasoning for brawling with the Filipino slugger; [...] "It {{was a great}} pleasure to fight this way. I think I was controlling the fight with my distance. Sometimes I need <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> flavor into the ring. My promoter always says that I make the fights very difficult, but they're not difficult, they're fun for the public. I decided to stop myself in front of him in the twelfth round because I wanted to give the public what they deserve. It was a great round. I'm very happy about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|A section {{from the}} {{eleventh}} {{chapter of the}} serial published in New Review (May 1895) was deleted from the book. It was drafted {{at the suggestion of}} Wells's editor, William Ernest Henley, who wanted Wells to [...] "oblige your editor" [...] by lengthening the text with, among other things, an illustration of [...] "the ultimate degeneracy" [...] of humanity. [...] "There was a slight struggle," [...] Wells later recalled, [...] "between the writer and W. E. Henley who wanted, he said, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> 'writing' into the tale. But the writer was in reaction from that sort of thing, the Henley interpolations were cut out again, and he had his own way with his text." [...] This portion of the story was published elsewhere as [...] "". The deleted text was also published by Forrest J Ackerman in an issue of the American edition of Perry Rhodan.|$|E

6000|$|... "Which {{is not a}} blessing. Isn't {{there some}} proverb about going safely in the middle? I'm sure it's true about money,--only perhaps you ought <b>to</b> be <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> beyond the middle. I don't know why Plantagenet shouldn't do {{something}} for her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Harvey, I dare say, is not {{astonished}} at that. It {{is the usual}} fate of those who try <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> common sense into their fellow-men." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{he rides}} through the camp men nudge {{each other and}} say, 'That young fellow in staff uniform is Major Drummond;' {{and there is not}} a soldier but tries <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> extra respect into his salute." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes; {{there has}} been such an absurd amount of flattery {{bestowed}} on them that it must provoke any reasonable being. It really is time <b>to</b> <b>put</b> forth <b>a</b> <b>little</b> common sense, since the magazines will have it that earls write better than other people.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that's easily mended," [...] {{said the}} Princess, [...] "All I must do is <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> syrup on the broken parts, and stick them together, and then {{sit in the}} breeze until it hardens. I'll be all right in an hour from now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, how {{perfectly}} lovely!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Brown. [...] "I {{think the}} mauve one would suit the doll best, don't you, with such golden hair? Only don't {{you think it}} would make it much nicer to turn back the collar, so, and <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> band--so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs Frog {{acted on}} this advice, and thus was enabled {{to earn a}} {{sufficiency}} to enable her to pay her daily rent, to clothe and feed herself and child, {{to give a little}} to the various missions undertaken by the Institutions near her, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> now and then into the farthing bank, and even to give a little in charity to the poor! ...|$|E

60|$|But what car'd the Devil for that, or <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> handsomer, {{that was}} what Satan aimed at; for {{it was enough to}} him, to bring Mankind to act just {{contrary}} to what Heaven had directed or commanded them in any thing, and if possible in every Thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, very--very; {{and made}} a tidy lot of money too, has Fillgrave. He's worth six {{thousand}} pounds, I suppose; now that's {{a good deal of}} money <b>to</b> <b>put</b> by in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> town like Barchester." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{like to ask}} for {{her after}} all," [...] Laban faltered out. [...] "They were all in such a stir, trying <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> spirit into the party.

6000|$|... "It was {{to invite}} {{a young lady}} to a picnic, but I set to work and soon got it changed {{so that it would}} do very well. Slattery seems never to have asked any one to ride a tandem. But when I had written it, it seemed so dreadfully stiff that I had <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{beginning}} and end of my own, which seemed to brighten it up a good deal." ...|$|E
6000|$|They used <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> cricket in, {{upon the}} bottom of the chaise, for Rollo to sit upon; but this was not very convenient, and so one day Rollo’s father said that, now Rollo had become so {{pleasant}} a boy to ride with them, he would have a little seat made on purpose for him. “In fact,” said he, “I will take the chaise down to the corporal’s to-night, and see if he cannot do it for me.” ...|$|E
50|$|The Lead has to {{communicate}} {{the direction of the}} movement to the Follow. Traditionally, the Lead's right hand is on the follow's back, near the lowest part of the shoulder-blade. This is the strongest part of the back and the Lead can easily pull the Follow's body inwards. To enable the Lead {{to communicate}} a step forward (backward for the Follow) the Follow has <b>to</b> constantly <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> weight against the Lead's right hand. When the Lead goes forward, the Follow will naturally go backwards.|$|R

60|$|Sam 'adn't {{turned up}} {{by the time they}} got there, and pore Ginger took {{advantage}} of it <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> warm candle-grease on 'is bad leg. Then he bathed 'is face very careful and 'elped Peter bathe his 'ead. They 'ad just finished when they heard Sam coming upstairs, and Ginger sat down on 'is bed and began to whistle, while Peter took up a bit o' newspaper and stood by the candle reading it.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Carter {{called for}} some more beer {{and told the}} barmaid <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gin in it. In a pitiable state of [...] "nerves" [...] {{he sat at the}} extreme end of a bench, and felt that he was an object of unwholesome {{interest}} to his acquaintances. The finishing touch was put to his discomfiture when a well-meaning friend in a vague and disjointed way advised him to give up drink, swearing, and any other bad habits which he might have contracted.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes, {{there is}} no use in {{dwelling}} on this,' he said, quietly. 'The reason I asked you to be kind enough to come here, is that I {{do not think it}} well to be far from home under the circumstances. There, don't look frightened--they say it may very possibly not come for several months or a year. I hope to have time <b>to</b> <b>put</b> things <b>a</b> <b>little</b> in order for you, and that is one reason I wished to see you; I thought I could make the beginning easier to you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Probert {{looked at}} him a moment in vague surprise, but only said: [...] "I think they are. However, the period of discussion's closed. We've taken the jump."

6000|$|... 'Well, I see {{beauty in}} you, dear. And {{if you are}} not art, what is? I wish <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more nature into you, and get you away from this cold clay and marble into the sunshine, to dance and laugh as the others do. I want a flesh-and-blood girl, not a sweet statue in a grey pinafore, who forgets {{everything}} but her work.' As he spoke, two dusty hands came round his neck, and Bess said earnestly, punctuating her words with soft touches of her lips: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep {{a finger}} for each, {{or you will}} have your reins clubbed," [...] said he. [...] "As to the whip, the less fanning the better if you have willing cattle; but when you want <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> life into a coach, see that you get your thong on {{to the one that}} needs it, and don't let it fly round after you've hit. I've seen a driver warm up the {{off-side}} passenger on the roof behind him every time he tried to cut his off-side wheeler. I believe that is their dust over yonder." ...|$|E

6000|$|That evening they dined out, {{and went}} to [...] "The Tales of Hoffmann."

During the drive home in the dark cab, she shrank away into her corner, pretending that his arm would hurt her dress; her exasperated nerves were already overstrung. Twice she was on the very point of crying out: [...] "I am not Daphne Wing!" [...] But each time pride strangled the words in her throat. And yet they would have to come. What other reason could she find to keep him from her room? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Absolutely!" [...] Mr. Bundercombe declared. [...] "I {{stumbled}} across {{the truth in}} making inquiries concerning you and your probable future.

In the course of these inquiries I happened to run across a young woman who had been a typist in Harding's office. It was from her I learned the truth. As he rose in the world Harding seems to have treated the girl badly. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> kindness and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> attention on my part, and I learned the truth. She placed me in possession of the whole story after we had lunched together to-day." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{indeed there}} had appeared, {{shortly after the}} arrival of the policemen of the district, a very {{superior}} gentleman in a fur coat and a shiny hat, who sat down in the room and looked through all the papers himself.
