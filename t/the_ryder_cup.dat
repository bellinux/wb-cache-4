5|$|The 2013 World Financial Group Continental Cup of Curling {{was held}} from January 10 to 13 at the South Okanagan Events Centre in Penticton, British Columbia. The Continental Cup, based on <b>the</b> <b>Ryder</b> <b>Cup</b> of golf, pitted teams from North America against {{teams from the}} rest of the World.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ryder</b> <b>Cup</b> {{was played}} {{outside of the}} British Isles {{for the first time}} in 1997, as Valderrama Golf Club in Spain hosted the contest. Despite taking a five-point lead into the final day, Europe needed the half point Colin Montgomerie secured in his tied singles match with Scott Hoch to win 14½–13½. The 1999 match was the third time in {{succession}} the contest had been won by a single point, but this time it was the United States who won 14½–13½. This was not without controversy, as Europe were unhappy with the celebrations by the American team after a putt by Justin Leonard, while European golfer José María Olazábal still had a chance of holing his putt. <b>The</b> <b>Ryder</b> <b>Cup</b> was scheduled to be played in 2001, but two weeks before the competition was scheduled to take place the September 11 attacks occurred. The United States fearing for their safety requested the match be played a year later in 2002. When the match was played, Europe won 15½–12½ to regain the Cup. They retained the Cup in 2004 when they won 18½–9½ at Oakland Hills Country Club, in what was the United States' heaviest defeat in the competition. The result was repeated in 2006 at the K Club. Europe's 18½–9½ victory marked the first time they had won three matches in succession. The United States regained <b>the</b> <b>Ryder</b> <b>Cup</b> in 2008, winning for the first time since 1999. They won the match when Jim Furyk beat Miguel Ángel Jiménez with four singles matches still ongoing, to win 16½–11½. A tight contest in 2010 came down to the final singles match between European Graeme McDowell and American golfer Hunter Mahan. McDowell won his match with a hole to spare, to give Europe a 14½–13½ victory. Europe recovered a 10–6 deficit on the last day in 2012, as they won eight of the twelve singles matches to win 14½–13½.|$|E
5|$|Golf {{has been}} {{prominent}} in England; {{due in part}} to its cultural and geographical ties to Scotland, the home of Golf. There are both professional tours for men and women, in two main tours: the PGA and the European Tour. England has produced grand slam winners: Cyril Walker, Tony Jacklin, Nick Faldo, and Justin Rose in the men's and Laura Davies, Alison Nicholas, and Karen Stupples in the women's. The world's oldest golf tournament, and golf's first major, is The Open Championship, played both in England and Scotland. The biennial golf competition, <b>the</b> <b>Ryder</b> <b>Cup,</b> is named after English businessman Samuel Ryder who sponsored the event and donated the trophy. Nick Faldo is the most successful Ryder Cup player ever, having won the most points (25) of any player on either the European or US teams.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ryder</b> <b>Cup</b> is a golf {{competition}} contested by {{teams from}} Europe and the United States. The competition was originally contested between Great Britain and the United States, Republic of Ireland golfers first {{played in the}} British team in 1953 and this was extended to golfers elsewhere in Europe in 1979. Established in 1927, the competition is jointly administered by the Professional Golfers' Association of America (PGA of America) and Ryder Cup Europe, a venture in which the PGA European Tour is the primary partner. The competition takes place every two years, {{with the exception of}} 2001 when the match was played a year later due to the 11 September attacks; the venue alternates between courses in Europe and the United States. The winners of the first match were the United States, who defeated Great Britain at Worcester Country Club 9½–2½. The most recent match, held at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Minnesota, was won by United States, who beat Europe by a score of 17–11. The next match will be at Le Golf National in Paris, France in September 2018.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ryder</b> <b>Cup</b> is contested in a {{match play}} format, which {{involves}} different {{methods of the}} format. A foursomes match is contested with two members from each team playing alternate shots. A fourball match consists of two players from either team, who each play their own shot throughout the round. The player that completes {{the hole in the}} lowest number of shots wins the hole. Singles matches are also played, with players from each team contesting a one-on-one match. The winner of each match scores a point for their team, if a match is tied after 18 holes then each team is awarded a ½ point. The format of the competition has changed throughout its history. Originally, foursome matches were played one day, with singles matches over 36 holes the next. Since 1979, the format has consisted of 28 matches held over three days, with each match worth a point. The first two days consist of eight matches; four foursomes and four fourball matches. The final day sees all 12 members of each team competing in singles matches.|$|E
5|$|The Team of the Year Award {{was first}} {{presented}} in 1960, {{six years after}} the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award was introduced. The first recipient of the award was the Cooper Formula One Racing team. The England national rugby union team and <b>the</b> <b>Ryder</b> <b>Cup</b> team have won the award the most times; both teams have won five times and have shared the award {{on one of those}} occasions. Liverpool F.C. have won the award three times. The award has been shared on two occasions—by the British women's 4x400m relay team and the British Ryder Cup team in 1969, and by the England national rugby union team and the British men's 4x400m relay team in 1991. Teams have varied greatly in size. The smallest winning team has been two members; the figure skating duo of Torvill and Dean in 1982 and 1983, and the Olympic men's coxless rowing pair of Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent in 1992 and 1996. The largest winning team was in 2012; the British representatives at the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} the Second World War meant <b>the</b> <b>Ryder</b> <b>Cup</b> was not contested again until 1947 at Portland Golf Club. The United States {{dominated}} the match in wet conditions, as Great Britain scored one point in an 11–1 defeat. The 1949 match was closer than the previous contest. Great Britain went into the final day with a 3–1 lead, but {{they were unable to}} secure the three and a half points they needed to win and lost 7–5. The 1951 contest at Pinehurst Resort, was again won by the United States. Such was the dominance in their 9½–2½ victory, that only two of the twelve matches reached the 18th hole. Before the 1953 contest Great Britain were given a boost when American Ben Hogan decided not to participate. He had won three of the four men's major golf championships during the year and his absence gave them optimism. However, they were unable to beat the United States; mistakes {{at the end of their}} singles matches by Peter Alliss and Bernard Hunt cost Great Britain as they lost 6½–5½. Despite recording their best points total in matches held in the United States, Great Britain were again defeated in 1955. The United States won 8–4 to extend their winning streak to 21 years.|$|E

There is no prize money in these events, so they are irrelevant to the money list, but an immense amount of pride rides on the results.|$|E
