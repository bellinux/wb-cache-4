5|$|An eighth, fragmentary {{specimen}} {{was discovered}} in 1990, not in Solnhofen limestone, but in somewhat younger sediments at Daiting, Suevia. Therefore, it {{is known as the}} Daiting Specimen, and had been known since 1996 only from a cast, briefly shown at the Naturkundemuseum in Bamberg.

5|$|Given {{the choice}} of her next feature, Hepburn decided to star in George Cukor's new project, Sylvia Scarlett (1935), which paired her for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> Cary Grant. Her hair was cut short for the part, as her {{character}} masquerades as a boy {{for much of the}} film. Critics disliked Sylvia Scarlett and it was unpopular with the public. She next played Mary Stuart in John Ford's Mary of Scotland (1936), which met with a similarly poor reception. A Woman Rebels (1936) followed, a Victorian era drama where Hepburn's character defied convention by having a child out of wedlock. Quality Street (1937) also had a period setting, this time a comedy. Neither movie was popular with the public, which meant she had made four unsuccessful pictures in a row.|$|E
