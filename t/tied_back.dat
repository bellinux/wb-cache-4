5|$|The variable-quality cement {{which had}} been used in the {{construction}} of the Causeway bridges meant that by the early 2000s, they had suffered significant damage, leading to a repair contract being awarded to Kulin Group in 2004. Localised patching of cracks in the piers was undertaken. At the ends of the piers, the cracking was more substantial and had to be <b>tied</b> <b>back</b> with carbon fibre reinforcement. Repairs were then coated with moisture-resistant coating, and were expected to lengthen the life of the bridges by decades.|$|E
5|$|Tomb Raider: Underworld {{continued}} the plot line established in Legend. Crystal Dynamics used {{new technology to}} improve the character for seventh generation consoles, focusing on improving realism. The dirt accumulation and water cleansing mechanic from Legend was altered to be a real-time mechanic that can involve the entire game environment. To achieve a more natural appearance, the developers added spherical harmonics to provide indirect lighting to in-game objects like Lara Croft. Crystal Dynamics made the character model more complex and detailed than previous instalments, featuring more texture layers that determine the appearance of shadows and reflective light on it, and using skeletal animation to portray believable movement. The number of polygons in the model increased to 32,000. The developers enhanced Croft's facial model by {{increasing the number of}} polygons, bones used in the animation skeleton, and graphical shaders in the face to add more detail and expressive capabilities. The hair was created as a real-time cloth simulation to further add realism to its shape and movement. The developers kept Croft's hair <b>tied</b> <b>back</b> because they felt a real person would not want it flying around while performing dangerous manoeuvres. The character's body size was increased and breast size reduced to portray more realistic proportions.|$|E

500|$|Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy {{awarded the}} story {{four out of}} five stars, writing that it flowed better than Cross' last episode, [...] "The Rings of Akhaten", and allowed for the {{exploration}} of several themes. While he was positive towards the way the story was <b>tied</b> <b>back</b> to a time traveller, he felt that the ending was [...] "perhaps less interesting than what's come before, simply because it feels more familiar", though it was still [...] "solid". IGN's Mark Snow gave the episode a score of 8.4 out of 10. He praised the smaller scope and focus on character, but wrote [...] "the left-field genre detour didn't completely convince, and felt jarringly underwhelming considering the spooky set-up, but at least it tried something unique". Jordan Farley of SFX gave [...] "Hide" [...] {{four out of five}} stars. Farley felt that the science fiction element left too many answers, but said that it excelled as a love story.|$|E
500|$|The A.V.

[...] However, he also said, [...] "it's sure to become one of, if not the most talked-about episode of South Park ever." [...] Even after Comedy Central announced they {{were responsible for the}} censorship in [...] "201", he speculated as to whether it was possibly a publicity stunt by Parker and Stone to create controversy and increase viewership. Ramsey Isler of IGN said the episode built on the events of [...] "200" [...] and delivered a strong payoff, particularly with the subplot about Cartman's father and the way it <b>tied</b> <b>back</b> to [...] "Scott Tenorman Must Die". Isler said the bleeps added by Comedy Central provided some unintentional laughs and underscored the episode's underlying theme opposing censorship.|$|E

500|$|In the 1950 Technicolor western, Comanche Territory, O'Hara {{played an}} unusual {{role as the}} lead {{character}} of Katie Howards, a fiery saloon owner who dresses, behaves and fights like a man, with hair <b>tied</b> <b>back.</b> She [...] "mastered the American bullwhip" [...] during the filming, [...] in a role which Crowther believed was [...] "more significant than a setting sun" [...] in that she [...] "tackles her assignment with so much relish {{that the rest of}} the cast, even the Indians, are completely subdued." [...] She received first billing above co-star Macdonald Carey. O'Hara then appeared as Countess D'Arneau opposite John Payne in Tripoli, directed by O'Hara's second husband, William Houston Price. She was next cast by John Ford in the western Rio Grande, the final installment of his cavalry trilogy. It was the first of five films to be made over 22 years with John Wayne, including The Quiet Man (1952), The Wings of Eagles (1957), McLintock! (1963) and Big Jake (1971), the first three of which were directed by Ford. O'Hara declared that [...] "from our very first scenes together, working with John Wayne was comfortable for me". Her chemistry with Wayne was so powerful that over the years many people assumed that they were married, and newspapers occasionally published sensationalist stories from people claiming to be their love child. In April 1951, she received a call from Universal Pictures that she was cast as a Tunisian princess named Tanya in the swashbuckler film, Flame of Araby (1951). O'Hara [...] "despised" [...] the film and everything it stood for, [...] but had no choice but to make the film or be suspended. By that point of time, she began to grow tired of the roles she was offered and wanted to perform roles that had more depth than the ones she had done thus far.|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode, [...] ""No One" [...] may have given us a bloodless siege, but {{there were plenty of}} bloody moments, namely from the {{brothers}} Clegane, who were both awesomely brutal this week. Though not against one another, as it looks like, for now, the Cleganebowl's been canceled. I loved the end of Arya's arc along with Jaime's scheme to take Riverrun - though I'm curious to see what comes of the Tully angle. Brienne failed to get an army for Sansa and Jaime's just going to head back home now? It seems like there should be more to this that him just winning one for the Lannister name. Though regardless of what the payoff might be, it was still good to see how so much of this story <b>tied</b> <b>back</b> to the first three seasons and Jaime's time as Catelyn's prisoner." [...] He gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club criticized the episode's momentum within the season, writing [...] "The lack of momentum driving these stories is surprising to me given that the season has largely been doing a fine job with internal momentum." [...] McNutt continued, [...] "The show may have run into an unfortunate convergence of so many anti-climactic storylines in a single episode, but their very existence is a necessary byproduct of a narrative that is preparing to shed its skin and move forward with a new lease on life." [...] Despite this, he gave the episode a grade of B-. Erik Kain of Forbes wrote about the episode, [...] "Not the greatest episode of the season, but I still didn't want it to end. Sometimes I realize that even an episode I have lots of complaints about manages to be some of the best television out there. Game of Thrones isn't always on the money, but even an off night can be surprisingly good." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly summarized the episode in his review by saying [...] "Cheers, chills, and the sound of online fan theories imploding. [...] "No One" [...] delivered Jaime Lannister's finest scene in years, a thrilling chase, and set one Stark on an exciting new path." ...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the stresses and displacement induced in the periodontium by an active retraction screw device (hycon device) and an active <b>tie</b> <b>back</b> using the finite element analysis. Materials and Methods: A 3 -dimensional {{model of the}} maxillary dentition was designed for the study. A retraction force of 410 and 200 g was applied to simulate the forces generated by the hycon device and an active <b>tie</b> <b>back</b> respectively. The stresses generated by these forces were evaluated on the periodontium at cervix, mid root and apical region. Results: In the present study, maximum amount of tensile stresses {{were found on the}} labio-cervical (0. 4919 and 0. 2945 MPa) aspects of canine, compressive stresses on the linguo-cervical (− 0. 1758 and − 0. 0679 MPa) aspect of the 2 nd premolar and the apical region of all teeth showed low magnitude compressive stresses, with both the loads. The displacement produced by the retraction screw was of the magnitude 0. 172 - 0. 183 mm (0. 177 mm) in the anterior segment and 0. 0065 - 0. 007822 mm (0. 0071 mm) in the posteriors (anchor loss). Active <b>tie</b> <b>backs</b> produce a displacement of 0. 162 - 0. 172 mm in the anterior segment and a negligible amount of displacement in the posteriors. Conclusions: Even though the stress level in the periodontium produced by hycon device was almost 2 - 3 times that of active <b>tie</b> <b>backs,</b> the displacement produced per activation was within the physiological limits and less than the width of the periodontium (0. 20 - 0. 25 mm), which in turn induces bone remodeling...|$|R
