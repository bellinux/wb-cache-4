In July 1912, the liner prepared <b>to</b> <b>depart</b> Cuba without an inspection and fumigation, but faced the prospect of seven days quarantine in Havana before the ship would be allowed <b>to</b> <b>depart.</b> However, a compromise was worked out by the United States Marine Hospital Service which allowed Havana <b>to</b> <b>depart</b> after a one-day delay. In September of the same year, another inspection gaffe resulted in government prosecution of the Ward Line.|$|E

5|$|Talion then {{travels to}} the Black Gate for a final {{confrontation}} with the Black Hand. The Black Hand quickly incapacitates him with a spell that also restores the last of Celebrimbor's memories. He then kills himself {{as part of a}} ritual that forces Celebrimbor <b>to</b> <b>depart</b> from Talion and merge with himself. This allows Sauron to possess the Black Hand's body and incarnate in physical form. However, Celebrimbor is able to briefly paralyze Sauron from within, allowing Talion to destroy Sauron's physical form. With the Black Hand dead, Celebrimbor wishes <b>to</b> <b>depart</b> for Valinor. Talion instead convinces him to stay and attempt to overthrow Sauron. Gazing at Mount Doom, Talion declares his intention to forge a new Ring of Power.|$|E
