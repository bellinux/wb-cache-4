5|$|The false {{story of}} the {{execution}} of the Ho-Chunk prisoners, along with the incessant American trespassing, convinced some Ho-Chunks to take up arms against the United States. The timing seemed right, since the evacuation of Fort Crawford appeared to be a sign of American weakness. Another grievance was the news that some Ho-Chunk women had been sexually assaulted by American riverboat crews along the Mississippi River, although this story, like <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> executions, may have been a false rumor. The Ho-Chunks broke off diplomatic relations with the United States by not showing up for a scheduled treaty conference, and prepared for war.|$|E

40|$|Detecting {{duplicate}} bug reports helps reduce triaging {{efforts and}} save time for developers in fixing the same issues. Among several automated detection approaches, text-based information retrieval (IR) approaches {{have been shown}} to outperform others in term of both accuracy and time efficiency. However, those IR-based approaches do not detect well the duplicate reports on the same technical issues written in different descriptive terms. This paper introduces DBTM, a duplicate bug report detection approach that takes advantage of both IR-based features and topic-based features. DBTM models a bug report as a textual document describing certain technical issue(s), and models duplicate bug reports as <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same technical issue(s). Trained with historical data including identified duplicate reports, it is able to learn the sets of different terms describing the same technical issues and to detect other not-yet-identified duplicate ones. Our empirical evaluation on real-world systems shows that DBTM improves the state-of-the-art approaches by up to 20 % in accuracy...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{object of}} this paper is to learn what little {{children}} know <b>about</b> <b>the</b> inside of their bodies before they have studied these particular aspects at school. The data for our project were collected by means of drawings made by 342 Spanish children aged four to seven. They were required to depict where the food, drink and air which enter their bodies go. In addition to this, we intend to study how the ideas of children evolve during three consecutive years. For this purpose, a group of 32 subjects was monitored. Our findings show that the children recognise specific organs in their own bodies which they associate with the intake of food and air. Furthermore, they usually extrapolate those organs to other animals they are familiar with. Their ideas <b>about</b> <b>the</b> digestive system are more adequate than <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> respiratory system, though their ideas improve as they become older, above all those concerning the digestive system. Taking these finding as a basis, this paper suggests some points to be taken into consideration for teaching purposes...|$|R
