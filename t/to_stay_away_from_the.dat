25|$|In addition, {{the drum}} modes {{analogous}} to p and d modes in an atom show spatial irregularity along the different radial directions {{from the center}} of the drum, whereas all of the modes analogous to smodes are perfectly symmetrical in radial direction. The non radial-symmetry properties of non-s orbitals are necessary to localize a particle with angular momentum and a wave nature in an orbital where it must tend <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> central attraction force, since any particle localized at the point of central attraction could have no angular momentum. For these modes, waves in the drum head tend to avoid the central point. Such features again emphasize that the shapes of atomic orbitals are a direct consequence of the wave nature of electrons.|$|E
