URA was invited to the presentation but did not show up. His proposal entailed re-routing the tunnel to save the National Library building. A week later, Tay wrote to the Prime Minister's Office regarding his proposal which was referred to the MND. Many members of the public wrote in publicly either in support of Tay's plans or argue for heritage conservation in general. A few articles and letters highlighted that the adamant official response to public dissent ran counter to the spirit of the Government's S21 Vision, which expressed a desire to foster civic participation and active citizenry.|$|E

5|$|The railway {{was officially}} opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 9 September 2015. Her Majesty {{travelled}} with the Duke of Edinburgh and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on LNER Class A4 4488 Union of South Africa {{in the presence}} of its owner, John Cameron. The locomotive hauled a rake of Mark 1s provided by the SRPS as well as Pullman car No. 310 Pegasus. Due to bad weather, the Queen's helicopter journey from Balmoral was delayed which resulted in the late departure of the train and a delay at Newcraighall while a ScotRail service cleared the single-line section to the south. Her Majesty alighted at Newtongrange <b>to</b> <b>unveil</b> a plaque marking the opening of the railway; a second plaque was unveiled at Tweedbank. The following day the LNER Class A4 commenced a six-week programme of Borders steam specials promoted by ScotRail which saw services run to Tweedbank for three days each week. Around 6,200 passengers were carried on the 17 fully booked services.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for {{the introduction of the}} F/A-18 Hornet, No.2 OCU temporarily ceased flying operations on 1January 1985 and transferred Macchi and Mirage training to No.77 Squadron, which assumed responsibility for fighter combat instructor, introductory fighter, and Mirage conversion courses. Beginning on 17May, the first fourteen Australian Hornets—seven single-seat F/A-18As and seven two-seat F/A-18Bs—and a Hornet simulator were delivered to No.2 OCU. Conversion courses on the type commenced on 19August with four F/A-18Bs and three students. No.2 OCU has remained the prime user of the two-seat Hornet, though some are operated by the fighter squadrons, Nos.3, 75 and 77. The first year of Hornet service saw No.2 OCU, as the then-only RAAF operator, undertake demonstration flights around the country <b>to</b> <b>unveil</b> the new fighter to the Australian public. All of the Hornet units came under the control of a newly re-formed No.81 Wing on 2February 1987. An intense training program that year resulted in 21 pilots converting to the type. In June 1987, Macchi training courses again became the responsibility of No.2 OCU; this role was taken over by No.76 Squadron in January 1989. No.2 OCU suffered its only Hornet loss to date when an F/A-18B crashed at Great Palm Island, Queensland, during a night-time training flight on 18November 1987, killing the pilot. Two Hornets collided during an air-to-air combat training exercise the previous year, but both managed to return to base. The unit temporarily relocated to RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, in July 1990, while Williamtown's runway was resurfaced.|$|E
