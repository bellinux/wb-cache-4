40|$|A flavored coating {{is applied}} to most snack foods and plays an {{important}} role in both the flavor and appearance of a snack. The snack food industry is constantly striving to obtain a competitive advantage by improving their flavor and appearance. From roll salter to pneumatic application, and <b>tumble</b> <b>drum,</b> many powder coating methods have been used to refine powder coating quality and efficiency. Electrostatic powder coating technology has been around for decades, and has been used in the food industry, especially in seasoning of snack foods. In corona electrostatic powder coating system, high voltage on the charging wire breaks down surrounding air and generates an ion rich region. When food powders transport through the ion rich region, they pick up charges quickly and land on the grounded food targets. Electrically charged food powder particles repel each other and form a uniform cloud to evenly coat a grounded food product. Electrostatic coating technology provides more uniform and efficient coating compared to traditional coating technologies. Relative humidity (RH) has effect on corona discharge (Chen and Wan...|$|R
40|$|A {{innovative}} {{wastewater treatment}} plant was designed, constructed and operated to remove toxic heavy metals from copper mine drainage at an isolated, subalpine site in Northern California. Though on pilot scale, up to 60 % of wastewater from the mine was treated to remove an average of 72 % of copper at high loadings, or 93 % average copper removal at lower loadings. Treatment involved neutralization first with crushed limestone, then with alkaline reagent solution to approximately pH 10, followed by settlement in a basin. Metals removal efficiency was limited by solids separation in the basin, which was consistent with fourth-order removal kinetics. A rudimentary filter intended to remove residual flocculated metal was found ineffectual, conventional filtration being impractical.

40|$|The {{practice}} of tight backing adhesive bound, hard cover books {{has long been}} thought to enhance durability {{at the expense of}} openability. Tight backing is popular in a number of specialized binding markets, the most notable of which is textbook production. Yet despite their prevalence, {{there is a lack of}} information available about how the openability and durability characteristics of tight backed books are affected by variable factors in the production process. The purpose of this study was to evaluate three variables involved in the production of tight backed, adhesive bound, hardcover volumes. The three factors considered were bulk of the book block, surface area of adhesive application to the spine and paper stock. Analyses of durability was conducted using two pieces of testing apparatus, the Octagonal <b>Tumbling</b> <b>Drum</b> and the Universal Book Tester. Openability was measured using the Photocopy Openability Test. The statistical design utilized a blocked and replicated three way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), conducted at the 0. 05 alpha level. Where the data led to the rejection of the null hypothesis, a Duncan Multiple Range Test was employed to isolate the source of the variation. The procedures determined that bulk had no effect on openability, but became a factor in durability when the book was subjected to severe abuse. Paper stock was deemed to have no significant effect on either durability or openability. With regard to adhesive treatment, an inverted relationship was found to exist between durability and openability. As adhesive coating increased in surface area, durability was enhanced at the expense of openability. This was found to be a non-linear relationship. Finally, it was found that if the proper materials and construction techniques were employed in book production, then bindings with high durability could be created despite effects of other variable factors...|$|E
40|$|Wet {{granulation}} is {{a process}} used for the particle size enlargement of primary powders. The mixing of a liquid with the powder glues the primary particles together, which results {{in the formation of}} the granules. The mixing action can be performed in many ways, like <b>tumbling</b> (<b>drum</b> granulation), fluidizing (fluid bed granulation) and high-intensity mixing (high shear granulation). In the pharmaceutical industry granulation is commonly used for the production of solid formulations (e. g. tablet or capsules). A problem that is regularly observed during high shear granulation is that the drug substance is poorly distributed over the granules. This means that there is a granule size-dependent variation in composition of the granules. In this thesis the granulation mechanisms that are involved in the formation of non-homogeneous granules in a high shear mixer are elucidated. The relevance of the investigation of these mechanisms is emphasised by the current initiative of the authorities concerning quality assurance. This initiative is focused on quality testing throughout the process, which implies that testing at the final stage is inadequate. High shear granulation is commonly used as an intermediate step in the production process of a solid formulation. Consequently, quality control of high shear granulation with respect to granule uniformity is essential. Unfortunately, there is limited information about the mechanisms underlying the inhomogeneity of the granules. This means that the control is often based on trial-and-error experiments instead of science. This thesis provides new scientific insights into these mechanisms, namely; Granule breakage behaviour, which results in a continuous exchange of primary particles, has a positive influence on granule homogeneity. In contrast, absence of granule breakage means that heterogeneous granules can be formed. During layering small primary particles have a higher affinity for growth than large particles. This mechanism, called preferential growth, is responsible for the inhomogeneity. Penetration of binder liquid into the porous powder bed results in the immediate formation of granules already in the early seconds of the granulation process. If these freshly formed granules are strong enough to withstand the shear forces, these granules can function as kernels for preferential growth. Consequently, this nucleation mechanism can induce the granule inhomogeneity. Furthermore, the effects of changes in process and formulation parameters on these mechanisms are determined. In the different chapters mechanistic models are proposed. Firstly, these models are intended to describe these mechanisms. Secondly, the theoretical calculations are used to evaluate the influence of the process condition. The enumerated mechanisms are not only of importance for the granule inhomogeneity phenomena. In fact, these mechanisms will influence the general granulation behaviour in the high shear mixer. Therefore the content of this thesis is discussed in the perspective of current knowledge of high shear granulation. This discussion points out that comprehension of the rate processes of high shear granulation is a general interest. The understanding of the mechanisms provides a fundamental basis to prevent costly trial-and-error experiments to assure control of the high shear granulation process. For the pharmaceutical industry this control is mainly focused on homogeneity, while other granule properties will be of importance in a different industrial environment...|$|E

40|$|Ultra-fine powders, sized between 0. 1 – 10 µm, are {{commonly}} used materials {{in a variety of}} industries including detergents, catalysts, paint pigments, and agricultural products. Ultra-fine powders are known to have complex behaviors due to cohesive forces and are considered difficult to handle, feed, and form consistent final products. One specific issue is that wet granules formed from ultra-fine powders are difficult to densify and take significant amounts of time to reach a desired granule density. This thesis hypothesizes that formation of complex structures within ultra-fine powder granules is responsible for densification issues and that the granule microstructure can be controlled through careful powder handling and preparation prior to the granulation. Furthermore, this thesis hypothesizes that ultra-fine powders have unique behaviors separate from larger primary particles which requires specific studies in the applicable size range to understand ultra-fine powder granulation. ^ In order to investigate this hypothesis, methods are developed to describe the granule microstructure and specifically the granule void phase distribution in 3 D space. X-ray computed tomography (XRCT) and image analysis techniques are used to isolate, identify and describe the spatial distribution of the various granule phases. Additional methods for distinguishing between large macro-voids and the pore space between primary particles are created as well as tools for quantifying macro-void size, shape, volume fraction in the granule (2 ̆ 6 epsiv;void) and distribution of the voids within the granule structure. Descriptions of macro-void size, shape, and volume fraction show that the macro-void properties depend upon primary particle size, powder history, liquid binder and method of granule formation. ^ The granule microstructure measurement methods are developed to describe the internal structure of single-droplet nuclei granules formed in a static powder bed. Alumina powders with mean size varying from 0. 5 to 100 µm are used as model powders with water and polymer solutions as the liquid binders. The size, shape, and macro-void volume fraction (2 ̆ 6 epsiv;void) of the macro-voids is used to describe the effects of primary particle size and powder bed preparation on granule microstructure. Granules formed from ultra-fine powders show the presence of large spheroidal macro-voids distributed throughout a particle matrix. Granules formed from coarser powders show either no macro-voids or non-spheroidal macro-voids which are described as “cracks” within the granule microstructure. Smaller primary particles within the ultra-fine powder range are found to increase the size and 2 ̆ 6 epsiv;void of measured macro-voids and the complexity of the structure. The maximum void size and 2 ̆ 6 epsiv;void are dependent upon the powder bed preparation technique. Sifting the material through a 1. 4 mm sieve produces a larger maximum macro-voids size and larger 2 ̆ 6 epsiv;void than producing powder beds by sifting through either 710 µm or 500 µm sieves. Sifting of 0. 5 µm primary particles results in formation of stable, large, spheroidal agglomerates while other tested materials do not form stable structures from sifting. ^ The developed methods are also applied to single-droplet granules formed in a <b>tumbling</b> <b>drum</b> to investigate granule microstructures from a moving bed. The effects of consolidation time and liquid binder viscosity are also evaluated and the results are compared to predictions from the surface-tension flow model of the nucleation immersion mechanism developed by Hounslow et al. As consolidation time increases, the thickness of the powder shell slowly increases, but the internal void structure is unchanged. Increasing the liquid binder viscosity increases the void size and 2 ̆ 6 epsiv;void. Granules formed from the 25 µm powder have a simpler structure. They have a uniform packing structure of the primary particles surrounding a central void. This structure forms within the first few seconds and is then unaffected by either time on liquid viscosity. Apart from the persistence of the central void, the kinetics of nucleation for the coarse powder agrees with Hounslow’s model. However, the ultrafine powder granules have a complex multiscale structure that is not predicted from a simple nucleation model. ^ Finally, the feeding behavior of several ultra-fine and coarser powders used in the pharmaceutical industry is evaluated using the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the mass flow rate for a twin-screw feeder run in volumetric mode to predict quality of feeding. The RSD results are compared to bulk powder flow properties measured with the FT 4 Powder Rheometer. The RSD of the mass flow rate does not correlate with any of the measured properties. The quality of material feeding and likelihood of failure remains a complicated endeavor with multiple types of failure that are not well described by a single material property.

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this work was to study the effect of adjustable process parameters on wood loss and bark removal in <b>tumble</b> <b>drum</b> debarking. The effect of capacity on the size distribution of the chips was studied {{in order to determine}} the optimal capacity for both the debarking and chipping sub-processes. The final aim was to propose a control strategy to optimise the processes by adapting their parameters according to the quality of the raw material. When the research started, earlier automation systems had focused on keeping the process alive, and economic values such as wood loss were not considered important. The process is usually controlled manually and shifts have different ways to manage it, which are based on trial and error. Bark removal in chemical pulp mills is usually higher than the values recommended in the literature, which in turn causes log breaking in the drum and increases wood loss. Even a small reduction in wood loss could have a substantial financial outcome. The lack of raw materials some time ago and the recession nowadays have highlighted the importance of more efficient log use. Data survey techniques were employed to reveal the interactions between drum variables from noisy measurements. Wood room data were analysed by modelling and deriving conclusions from the resulting parameters. In addition, log breaking and the size distribution of the chips were analysed under different process conditions. A pilot-scale drum was used to study residence time and the mechanical abrasion of logs. The results of this work indicated that the ratio of the volume of logs in the drum to capacity determines the residence time of the logs in the drum. Other variables influence the volume of logs in the drum, which together with capacity determine the residence time of logs in the drum, which affects wood loss and bark removal. The effect of capacity on the size distribution of the chips was not unambiguous, however, and it was therefore recommended to operate wood room at high capacity, because this reduces wood loss and increases annual production. The proposed control strategy adapts the residence time of logs in the drum to the quality of the debarked raw material by controlling the position of the closing gate. In addition, the control strategy adjusts the rotating speed of the drum using an open loop control. The results can be used to optimise the wood room process parameters. If the problem in wood room is excessive debarking, the residence time of the logs can be reduced and the rotating speed of the drum lowered. In this way the logs will be damaged less and wood loss will be reduced. Bark removal requirements in mechanical pulp mills are high, and the process parameters can be adapted to avoid problems in the subsequent processes due to excessive bark...|$|R

Varvtalet har varierats mellan 45 till 60 rpm ochbomullslaster från 2 till 8 kg har granskats. Valkhöjder av 30 till 90 mm har använts. För attanalysera resultaten från den första försöksserien har en statistisk modell använts. Dennamodell beskriver hur de olika parametrarna påverkar energieffektiviteten. Det har visats attlastens storlek följt av varvtalet har störst inverkan på torkningens energieffektivitet. Valkarnas höjd påverkade inte resultaten.
