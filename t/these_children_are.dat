5|$|Insecure {{attachment}} {{styles in}} toddlers involve unusual reunions after separation from a familiar person. The children may snub the returning caregiver, or {{may go to}} the person but then resist being picked up. They may reunite with the caregiver, but then persistently cling to him/her, and fail {{to return to their}} previous play. <b>These</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> more likely to have later social problems with peers and teachers, but some of them spontaneously develop better ways of interacting with other people.|$|E
5|$|Both {{linguistic}} and socio-cultural factors affect {{the rate at}} which vocabulary develops. Children must learn to use their words appropriately and strategically in social situations. They have flexible and powerful social-cognitive skills that allow them to understand the communicative intentions of others {{in a wide variety of}} interactive situations. Children learn new words in communicative situations. Children rely on pragmatic skills to build more extensive vocabularies. Some aspects of pragmatic behaviour can predict later literacy and mathematical achievement, as children who are pragmatically skilled often function better in school. <b>These</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> also generally better liked.|$|E

25|$|The first {{generation}} of Turkish immigrants is predominantly Turkish-speaking and has only limited Dutch competence.

25|$|In 2015, {{the country}} of India {{is home to the}} largest number of {{children}} who are working illegally in various industrial industries. Agriculture in India is the largest sector where many children work at early ages to help support their family. Many of <b>these</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> forced to work at young ages due to many family factors such as unemployment, a large number of family members, poverty, and lack of parental education.

25|$|Undocumented {{immigrants}} in mixed status families tend {{to work in}} jobs that do not provide employee based health insurance and/or employed in occupations that pay off the books. Moreover, we can also expect that poor noncitizen children whose parents lack job-based coverage have lower rates of participation than poor citizen children of U.S. citizens. The lack of insurance for citizen children in mixed-status families means that <b>these</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> less likely to receive timely care for acute conditions, {{and less likely to}} have their chronic conditions diagnosed and appropriately managed.|$|E

50|$|Children with a {{very rare}} {{disorder}} known as syndrome X maintain the fa√ßade of persistent toddler-like features while aging from birth to adulthood. Since the physical development of <b>these</b> <b>children</b> <b>is</b> dramatically delayed, <b>these</b> <b>children</b> appear to <b>be</b> a toddler or at best a preschooler. According to an epigenetic clock analysis, blood tissue from syndrome X cases is not younger than expected.|$|R
25|$|A schema (pl. schemata) is {{the mental}} {{framework}} that is created as children {{interact with their}} physical and social environments. For example, many 3-year-olds insist that the sun is alive because it comes {{up in the morning}} and goes down at night. According to Piaget, <b>these</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> operating based on a simple cognitive schema that things that move are alive. At any age, children rely on their current cognitive structures to understand the world around them. Moreover, younger and older children may often interpret and respond to the same objects and events in very different ways because cognitive structures take different forms at different ages.|$|E
25|$|Widespread child {{malnutrition}} in slums {{is closely related}} to family income, mothers' food practice, mothers' educational level, and maternal employment or housewifery. Poverty may result in inadequate food intake when people cannot afford to buy and store enough food, which leads to malnutrition. Another common cause is mothers' faulty feeding practices, including inadequate breastfeeding and wrongly preparation of food for children. Tada et al.'s study in Bangkok slums shows that around 64% of the mothers sometimes fed their children instant food instead of a normal meal. And about 70% of the mothers did not provide their children three meals everyday. Mothers' lack of education leads to their faulty feeding practices. Many mothers in slums don't have knowledge on food nutrition for children. Maternal employment also influences children's nutritional status. For the mothers who work outside, their children are prone to be malnourished. <b>These</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> likely to be neglected by their mothers or sometimes not carefully looked after by their female relatives. Recent study has shown improvements in health awareness in adolescent age group of a rural slum area.|$|E

Consequences to <b>these</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> likely to be more severe if their assaulted mother develops post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and does not seek treatment due to her difficulty in assisting her child with processing his or her own experience of witnessing the domestic violence.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the early}} 1950s to the present, {{more and more}} people in the United States have gone on to pursue degrees or {{certificates}} of higher education.
