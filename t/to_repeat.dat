40|$|Urocortin 1 (UCN 1) is a corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) -like peptide whose role in {{stress is}} not well characterized. To study the {{physiological}} role of UCN 1 in {{the response of the}} hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis to stress we generated UCN 1 knock-out (KO) mice and examined their adaptation <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> restraint and <b>to</b> cold environment. Wild type (WT) and UCN 1 KO animals were restrained hourly for 15 min from 9 am to 2 pm and blood samples were obtained for corticosterone measurement. WT animals adapted <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> restraint with a decreased corticosterone response: the restraint-stimulated corticosterone levels fell from 215 ± 31 ng/ml in naïve animals to 142 ± 50 ng/ml in mice subjected <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> restraint (P< 0. 01); and from 552 ± 98 ng/ml to 314 ± 58 ng/ml (P< 0. 001), in males and females respectively. Male UCN 1 KO mice did not show any adaptation <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> restraint; instead, it increased restraintstimulated corticosterone levels from 274 ± 80 ng/ml in naïve animals to 480 ± 75 ng/ml in mice subjected <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> restraint (P< 0. 001). Female UCN 1 KO mice showed only a partial adaptation <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> restraint with a decrease in the restraint-stimulated corticosterone response from 631 ± 102 ng/ml in naïve animals to 467 ± 78 ng/ml in mice subjected <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> restraint (P< 0. 01). In addition, UCN 1 KO mice showed no corticosterone response to 2 h cold environment. These data demonstrate an important role for UCN 1 in the HPA axis adaptation <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> restraint and in the corticosterone response to a cold environment. 2 Page 3 of 2...|$|R
