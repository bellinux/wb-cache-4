40|$|Influence {{of tourism}} as a {{catalyst}} for global economic growth is conventionally viewed as an unquestionable fact. Observation suggests that this idea is appraised without being subjected to more holistic analysis and organizational contributions. The research seeks to evaluate the impact of tourism through considering related international growth approaches and recognizes prospective growth theories in connection to challenges that tourism is facing regarding its role as a facilitator for economic growth in less developed countries. The complicacy of economic growth theories postulated in extensive researches leaves tentative option to assume a simple approach towards direct impact of tourism on economic progress in less developed countries. The research sets out to assess the correlation between tourism and growth theories as well as the impacts of indicators like Geographical Zone, Gross National Product (GNP) per capita as an indicator of General Standard of Living in a Country and Economic Classification of a country.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{several problems}} from {{the domain of}} duty — legislation. It presents such questions as: the notion of duties and their resemblance to taxes. The author claims, that duties are in fact taxes. The problems further {{discussed in this article}} are duties collected in commercial and non-commercial turnover. What has been characterized in greater detail are the differences between these two kinds of duties, particularly those concerning their assessment and amount. The author critically evaluates the distinction made between these two. kinds of duties. He claims, that the division into commercial and non-commercial duty is artificial and does not consider economic realities. Therefore, the author is for the abolition of this division. The duties, which are collected from tourists, the so-called non-commercial duties, have also been criticised in the article. In the author's opinion, the integration of socialist countries requires among others free flow of people. Meanwhile, however, the existing duties constitute one of the restraints of the development of tourism. Moreover, in the socialist countries, too much importance is attached ' to duties as instruments forming the market balance. It seems to be a task trespassing the possibilities of duties as such. Duties applied to the flow of tourists are also to limit the exportation of foreign currency. And yet, the really necessary move is the introductioin of a possibility to exchange ' the currency of socialist countries, using at the same time, such rates of exchange which consider the purchasing power of population. The author believes, that it would be highly advisable to abolish such duties in the <b>tourist</b> <b>exchange</b> among Comecon countries.

However, despite this tendency towards globalization, there are still some communities who have no contacts even within the same country (different tribes from an African country, for example) or countries which are isolated due to political doctrine (North Korea, for example), where contact with the rest of the world is not possible. The link depends on the place and time: the strength of the communist era in Eastern Europe compared to the openness of nowadays, for example, or the lack of interconnectedness in the Third World in the 21 st century due to the financial situation while in the same period of time, in developed countries, globalization is no longer theory, but everyday life (consumer goods coming from the other side of the world, <b>tourists,</b> <b>exchange</b> programmes, etc.).

The goal of this student project was to design a product or system that creates social interaction between people in a (semi-) public place. In this case to let <b>tourists</b> <b>exchange</b> experiences with each other in a hotel lobby. Tourist carry a lot of touristic experiences, for example information about nice restaurants, bars, best visiting times of museums, current events, unknown sights etc. Currently there is not much exchangeof this information while advice of other tourists appeared to be given more value than information by guiders or the tourist information. Based on this, a literature review towards social interaction in public places and an analysis of the context several concepts were created for systems that would enable social interaction between tourists. Throughout an iterative process these concepts were evaluated and developed using scenarios and experiential prototypes. This iterative process had a high user involvement with several user evaluations. This resulted in a final concept called the CityTIP system, where TIP stands for: 'Tourist Inspiring Pictures'. This system enables tourists to share their touristic photos with other guests as well gives them inspiration for exploring the city. The CityTIP system has been evaluated in a lab test to investigate thesocial interaction and general acceptance of the system.

Daily data from 1 / 1 / 1990 to 31 / 12 / 2008 are used to model tourist arrivals from the world, USA and Japan to Taiwan, as well as their associated volatility. Inclusion of the exchange rate allows approximate daily price effects to be captured. The Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) model is used to approximate long memory properties in daily exchange rates and international tourist arrivals, test whether alternative short and long run estimates of conditional volatility are sensitive to the approximate long memory in the conditional mean, examine asymmetry and leverage in volatility, and examine the effects of temporal and spatial aggregation. Asymmetry (though not leverage) is found for several alternative HAR models. For policy purposes, the empirical results suggest that an arbitrary choice of data frequency or spatial aggregation will not lead to robust findings.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the cultural-geo-politics of rapprochement tourism between China and Taiwan in the era of warming cross-strait relations. By moving away from state-centric approaches to the study of cross-strait tourism, it interrogates themes surrounding the concepts of ‘border’, ‘identity’ and ‘materiality’, in an attempt to offer a more nuanced understanding of the everyday micro-politics at play. More specifically, the thesis considers different taming strategies engaged by the authorities on both sides in dealing with sensitive histories and difficult heritages, and how their practices are materialised in the tourism landscape. In doing so, this study probes the often assumed processes of rapprochement that result from and animate the cross-border exchanges by providing powerful examples of how tourists respond to attempts to manipulate their opinions, how they interpret ideologically loaded materials {{on both sides of the}} Taiwan Strait, but also of the genuine curiosity and good will that can result. This showcases the everyday experiences of tourists and the various bordering practices they enact and encounter during their travel. Discussions on tourists’ subjectivities show that far from being passive ‘numbers’ or ‘flows’ as often assumed by economic-centric studies, cross-strait tourists are actively shaping the rapprochement landscape. Furthermore, inquiries into the material cultures of memory and identity provide novel insights that go well beyond the state-led ‘peace through tourism’ initiatives to look at how commercial culture is shaping and responding to memories and cross-strait movements. Empirical findings are able to unpack how the border is experienced through a range of artefacts – from border controls to travel documents and cross-border purchases that extend beyond the literal border. Additionally, this research also broadens the sensorium by looking beyond ‘sight’ seeing to incorporate the olfactory, tactile, auditory and gustatory senses in discussing knives made from artillery shells, music events in a defunct military tunnel, and foods offered by local entrepreneurs. Finally, in acknowledging that tourists are not the only subjects of tourism, the thesis examines the roles played by ghosts and deities in their participation of cross-strait rapprochement tourism. In doing this, it demonstrates that rapprochement tourism is more about ‘interactions along the side’ rather than state-level diplomatic exchanges. Forays into consumption practices, identity construction (both national and self), and border (un) making could prove to be significant in the advent of unprecedented <b>tourist</b> <b>exchanges</b> between China and Taiwan...|$|R

Various stakeholders involved in the heritage tourism supply chain have respective roles and responsibilities and SET posits that upon entering interactions, both parties will have a cost and a reward; perceptions of cost and benefit will influence the interaction. Trust is critical to this interaction given the social and political context of tourism. Two heritage-based regions were examined using a case study approach. In-depth interview were carried out with key informants and private and community sector stakeholders. Key findings suggest that trust is indeed integral to the success of exchanges between key stakeholders. Trust is dependent on several factors, including the delivery of essential tourism infrastructure, active engagement in consultative processes and confidence in public sector actions.

Given that the exchange rate is expressed in local currency units to the pound sterling, when the exchange rate rises (i.e., when there is a devaluation of the local currency), it becomes more expensive to apply for a student visa and, more importantly, to cover tuition and living cost expenses in the UK. Student visa applicants are likely to be sensitive to such changes when deciding whether or not to apply to UK educational programmes. Visa costs capture the expense of a student visa application.
