5|$|Between {{chapters}} in which Penelope is narrating, the twelve maids speak on topics from their point-of-view. They lament their childhood as slaves with no parents or playtime, sing of freedom, and {{dream of being}} princesses. They contrast their lives to Telemachus' and wonder {{if they would have}} killed him as a child if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would kill them as a young man. They blame Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die. In Hades, they haunt both Penelope and Odysseus.|$|E
5|$|In The Simpsons twentieth {{episode of}} the twentieth season, Four Great Women and a Manicure is loosely based on Macbeth. In the third act of the episode, Marge embodies Lady Macbeth, an ambitious wife who is {{frustrated}} by everything around her. She not only has to clean the costumes worn by other actors, but is also frustrated {{over the fact that}} Homer doesn't have any interest in auditioning for lead roles and would rather play a tree. She convinces him to kill Sideshow Mel and he does to assume the lead role of Macbeth. When Marge learns that no one cares for Homer's lack of acting skills over Hibbert's and those with no lines, she forces him to kill off everyone else until he's the only actor left. The angry spirits visit her that night and she tries to pin the blame on Homer. They refuse to believe Marge by pointing out that <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was a victim in her devious plans and get their revenge on her by killing her in a fright induced heart attack. Even though Homer gives Marge's ghost a promising performance, he eventually frustrates her more by killing himself so he doesn't have to audition for more Shakespearean plays. This forces Marge to learn her lesson the hard way when she must spend eternity with a lazy and happy Homer.|$|E
5|$|Newton's {{conversion}} was not immediate, but {{he contacted}} Polly's family and announced his intentions to marry her. Her parents were hesitant {{as he was}} known to be unreliable and impetuous. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was profane, but they allowed him to write to Polly, and he set to begin to submit to authority for her sake. He sought a place on a slave ship bound for Africa, and Newton and his crewmates participated in most of the same activities he had written about before; the only immorality from which he was able to free himself was profanity. After a severe illness his resolve was renewed, yet he retained the same attitude towards slavery as was held by his contemporaries. Newton continued in the slave trade through several voyages where he sailed up rivers in Africa now as a captain procured slaves being offered for sale in larger ports, and subsequently transported them to North America. In between voyages, he married Polly in 1750 and he found it more difficult to leave her {{at the beginning of each}} trip. After three shipping experiences in the slave trade, Newton was promised a position as ship's captain with cargo unrelated to slavery when, at the age of thirty, he collapsed and never sailed again.|$|E

Berg criticized Doris and Parker's family for giving him a Christian funeral even though <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was a confirmed atheist.

25|$|On July 19, 1810, the {{precursors}} {{of the independence}} - Camilo Torres Tenorio, José Acevedo Gómez, José Miguel Pey and Jorge Tadeo Lozano, among others - held a secret meeting in the Astronomic Observatory of Bogotá, the office of Francisco José de Caldas. They had been informed of a plan by the Spaniards to arrest prominent criollos who had ideas of independence; {{the precursors}} were determined to win their independence and they, that night, planned the revolution. They were also convinced that the upcoming visit of the Regency Commissioners, Antonio Villavicencio and Carlos Montúfar, would bring the same results it had in Cartagena de Indias. Camilo Torres proposed that the first strike had {{to come from the}} Spaniards, to incite the people for an uprising and to prevent their supporters from doing something about it. Camacho would go to the house of the viceroy and ask him to allow a Junta to take place: they knew {{that he was going to}} oppose this, but would use it as the Spaniards' way of undermining the American people. Meanwhile, Luis de Rubio and Antonio Morales would go to the house of José Gonzales Llorente and start a mob uprising with the excuse of borrowing a flower vase, something <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would refuse giving Llorente's reputation.|$|E

In Tommy Smith's view, Shankly was completely in tune with the city of Liverpool; he loved the supporters and they loved him, mainly [...] "because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> understood them".|$|E

500|$|In August 1965, the Beatles and Epstein visited Elvis Presley at {{his house}} in Perugia Way in Los Angeles, where Elvis' manager, Colonel Tom Parker, set up a {{roulette}} wheel and several packs of playing cards. Epstein immediately asked to play, as he {{was known for his}} love of gambling. McCartney frequently visited gambling clubs in London, such as Curzon House, Epstein's favourite club, where he often ran into Epstein. He once saw Epstein put a Dunhill lighter worth £100 (...) on the table, then lose it during a game of cards. Epstein often lost thousands of pounds by playing baccarat or chemin de fer, the original version of baccarat when it was introduced to France, but would stay at Curzon House the whole evening, eating an expensive meal and drinking fine wines. The club never presented Epstein with a bill, as <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> lost so much in the casino.|$|E

In his last season of professional hockey, Lyashenko played two games with the Rangers, and 71 with the Wolfpack. He put up the best numbers of his career in North America, with 23 goals and 35 assists. He played in the 2003 AHL All-Star Game, despite having asked for a release midway through the season to return to Russia. The request was denied by the Rangers, but his agent, Todd Diamond, said there were other teams interested in the forward's services; [...] "Several teams were interested in him because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> wasn't a fourth-line guy." ...|$|E

500|$|Though Reitman {{has claimed}} in countless {{interviews}} {{that he wrote}} the parts specifically for George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Melanie Lynskey, Amy Morton, Sam Elliott and Zach Galifianakis, some of the actors publicly stated their confusion in Reitman's assertion, if only because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was meeting with other actors all along including his choice to fill his last lead role with Ellen Page (who starred in Reitman's previous film Juno) for the part that Kendrick ultimately played. On the part played by Farmiga, he cited her ability to walk {{a fine line between}} aggressiveness and femininity. On Kendrick, Reitman cited that he was inspired by her performance in Rocket Science. On Clooney, he said, [...] "If you're going to make a movie about a guy who fires people for a living and you still want to like him, that actor better be damn charming and I don't think there's a more charming actor alive than George Clooney. I was very lucky he said yes." [...] Reitman said, on the B.S. Report with Bill Simmons, that he considered Steve Martin for the part if Clooney declined the role. Reitman said that he would have changed the movie with Martin and given Martin [...] "his Lost in Translation." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1982, {{the team}} {{began working on}} special effects film {{sequences}} with Industrial Light & Magic. After years of research, and key milestones such as the Genesis Effect in [...] and the Stained Glass Knight in Young Sherlock Holmes, the group, which then numbered 40 individuals, was spun out as a corporation in February 1986 by Catmull and Smith. Among the 38 remaining employees, there were also Malcolm Blanchard, David DiFrancesco, Ralph Guggenheim and Bill Reeves, who {{had been part of}} the team since the days of NYIT. Tom Duff, also an NYIT member, would later join Pixar after its formation. With Lucas' 1983 divorce, which coincided with the sudden dropoff in revenues from Star Wars licenses following the release of Return of the Jedi, <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would most likely sell the whole Graphics Group. Worried that the employees would be lost to them if that happened, which would prevent the creation of the first computer animated movie, they concluded that the best way to keep the team together was to turn the group into an independent company. But Moore's Law also said that the first film was still some years away, and they needed to focus on a proper product while waiting for the computers to become powerful enough. Eventually, they decided they should be a hardware company in the meantime, with their Pixar Image Computer as the core product, a system primarily sold to government agencies and the scientific and medical community.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Michael Emerson won a Primetime Emmy Award for {{his guest}} {{appearance}} as serial killer William Hinks on The Practice. The Lost producers liked {{his work on}} The Practice, so they were keen to cast Emerson {{in the role of}} Ben, then known as [...] "Henry Gale", as they thought he would fit the character well. He was originally contracted to appear in just three episodes of Lost, making his first appearance midway through the second season, in episode [...] "One of Them". The producers were so impressed by him that they contracted him for a further five episodes, citing the scene at the end of [...] "The Whole Truth" [...] where Ben asks for milk as the moment <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was a [...] "keeper". He was then made a part of the regular cast from the third season. Had Emerson not worked out during his initial appearances a different actor would have been cast for the leader of the Others, but it was always intended the survivors would have the leader right under their noses and not realize it. During one episode of the Official Lost Podcast, the producers state they always knew Ben would be the [...] "Big Bad". Emerson had no idea of his character's importance during his second season recurring role. He was told nothing about Ben's backstory and would only receive scripts at the last minute. He enjoyed how the ambiguity of Ben's motives allowed him to [...] "paint it the way [...] please". Sterling Beaumon was cast to play Ben in the flashbacks of episode [...] "The Man Behind the Curtain". Emerson's wife Carrie Preston was cast as Ben's mother following Emerson telling people at parties she was desperate for a part on the show.|$|E

500|$|Rivera {{achieved}} {{a reputation as}} an all-time great reliever among baseball experts and his peers. Hall of Fame starter-turned-closer Dennis Eckersley called him [...] "the best ever, no doubt", while Trevor Hoffman said he [...] "will go down as the best reliever in the game in history". Torre said, [...] "He's the best I've ever been around. Not only the ability to pitch and perform under pressure, but the calm he puts over the clubhouse." [...] Writer Tom Verducci said, [...] "Rivera is definitively the best at his position by a wider margin than any player at any position {{in the history of}} baseball. There is Rivera, a gulf, and then every other closer." [...] He compared Rivera's reputation for being the best at his position to that of Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky. MLB Commissioner Bud Selig said, [...] "Clearly unequivocally, he's the greatest relief pitcher of all time, and did {{it in a way that}} was remarkable." [...] Speaking about Rivera's looming presence at the end of games, Alex Rodriguez said, [...] "He's the only guy in baseball who can change the game from a seat in the clubhouse or the bullpen. He would start affecting teams as early as the fifth inning, because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was out there. I've never seen anyone who could affect a game like that." [...] Gossage said that Rivera [...] "might be the greatest closer of all-time" [...] but suggested that the modern closer's job has become too specialized and easy compared to multiple-inning [...] "firemen" [...] from Gossage's era; Rivera had only one regular season save of seven-plus outs in his career, whereas Gossage logged 53. Although the Baseball Writers' Association of America has historically been reluctant to elect relievers into the Baseball Hall of Fame, sportswriters anticipate that Rivera will be elected in his first year of eligibility. In 2016, ESPN.com ranked Rivera 49th on its list of the greatest MLB players.|$|E
