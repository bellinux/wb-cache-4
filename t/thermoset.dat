40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} bonding a thermoplastic polymer to a <b>thermosetting</b> polymer component, the thermoplastic polymer having a melting temperature that exceeds the curing temperature of the <b>thermosetting</b> polymer. The method comprises the steps of providing a cured <b>thermosetting</b> polymer component comprising an implant of a thermoplastic polymer {{at least at the}} part of the <b>thermosetting</b> polymer component to be bonded, locating a thermoplastic polymer in contact with at least the part to be bonded, heating the assembly to the melting temperature of the thermoplastic polymer, whereby the thermoplastic polymer of the implant melts and fuses with the thermoplastic polymer, and cooling the assembly. The thermoplastic polymer has a melting temperature that exceeds the curing temperature of the <b>thermosetting</b> polymer, and the implant is designed such that heating above the maximum operating temperature of the <b>thermosetting</b> polymer at the interface of the implant with the <b>thermosetting</b> polymer component is avoided during the bonding step.

40|$|<b>Thermosets</b> 2011 21 - 23 September 2011, Berlin, Germany <b>Thermosets</b> are covalently bonded, 3 D-crosslinked {{materials}} that can't be melted by heating or dissolved completely in any solvents. This three dimensional network is one surety for long term stability, no creeping {{and a lot}} of other outstanding properties (depending on the used monomers), but at the same time the crosslink-structure (insolubility) is a big disadvantage. Therefore, there is a need for concepts concerning recycling and repair. <b>Thermosetting</b> materials can be crosslinked by heat, radiation or a combination of both. For a good performance, high curing temperatures and long curing times are necessary. This means that a lot of energy is needed for the curing. One possibility for saving energy is to use microwave curing. Generally, <b>thermosets</b> provide hardness, strength at relatively high temperatures, insolubility, good heat and chemical resistance as well as the resistance to creep. But <b>thermosets</b> are usually brittle when highly crosslinked. Therefore the properties have to be balanced for each application. One of the goals of the conference was to show this potential, especially how to reach good toughness without losing performance. <b>Thermosets</b> are mainly used with fillers and/or reinforcements, which was another subject that has been pointed out in the presentations of the conference. The demands for processing of <b>thermosetting</b> resins can be very different, depending on the respective application, e. g. as adhesive, casting resins, foams, binders and prepregs, infusion or pultrusion resins. This whole spectrum of topics concerning <b>thermosets</b> was presented during the conference <b>Thermosets</b> 2011 that took place in September 2011 in Berlin, Germany...|$|R

40|$|Injectable <b>thermosetting</b> {{chitosan}} hydrogels {{are attractive}} systems for drug delivery and tissue engineering that combine biodegradability, biocompatibility {{and the ability}} to form in situ gel-like implants. Thermally-induced gelation relies advantageously on biopolymer secondary interactions, avoiding potentially toxic polymerization reactions that may occur with in situ polymerizing formulations. In view of a biomedical use, such formulations have to be sterilizable and storable on extended periods without losing their <b>thermosetting</b> properties. These two key features have been studied in the present paper. Chitosans from two different sources were added with several phosphate-free polyols or polyoses as gelling agents. Despite a reduction in chitosan molecular weight following autoclaving, the hydrogels prepared with autoclaved chitosan showed the desired <b>thermosetting</b> properties. Hence, chitosan steam sterilization combined with aseptic preparation of the hydrogel allows a sterile formulation to be obtained. Whereas <b>thermosetting</b> hydrogels were shown to be unstable when refrigerated, freezing was shown to be conceivable as a storage method.

25|$|In {{the final}} step, the molded {{component}} and core are both demolded and the core is melted-out from the molding. This {{is done in}} a hot bath, via induction heating, or {{through a combination of}} the two. Hot baths usually use a tub filled with glycol or Lutron, which is a phenol-based liquid. The bath temperature is slightly higher than that of the core alloy’s melting point, but not so high that it damages the molding. In typical commercial applications the parts are dipped into the hot bath via an overhead conveyor. The advantage to using a hot bath is that it is simpler than induction heating and it helps cure <b>thermoset</b> moldings. The disadvantage is that it is uneconomically slow at a cycle time of 60 to 90 minutes and it poses environmental cleanup issues. Typically the hot bath solution needs cleaning or replacement every year or every half year when used in combination with induction heating.|$|E

500|$|Plastics are {{generally}} {{divided into two}} categories, which are [...] "thermosets" [...] and [...] "thermoplastics." [...] A <b>thermoset</b> is a plastic in which a chemical reaction sets the molecular bonds after first forming the plastic, and then the bonds cannot be broken again without degrading the plastic. Thermosets cannot be melted, therefore, once a <b>thermoset</b> has set {{it is impossible to}} weld it. Examples of thermosets include epoxies, silicone, vulcanized rubber, polyester, and polyurethane.|$|E
500|$|For thermosets, {{typically}} {{two different}} chemical components are {{injected into the}} barrel. These components immediately begin irreversible chemical reactions which eventually crosslinks the material into a single connected network of molecules. As the chemical reaction occurs, the two fluid components permanently transform into a viscoelastic solid. [...] Solidification in the injection barrel and screw can be problematic and have financial repercussions; therefore, minimising the <b>thermoset</b> curing within the barrel is vital. This typically means that the residence time and temperature of the chemical precursors are minimised in the injection unit. The residence time can be reduced by minimising the barrel's volume capacity and by maximising the cycle times. These factors {{have led to the}} use of a thermally isolated, cold injection unit that injects the reacting chemicals into a thermally isolated hot mould, which increases the rate of chemical reactions and results in shorter time required to achieve a solidified <b>thermoset</b> component. After the part has solidified, valves close to isolate the injection system and chemical precursors, and the mould opens to eject the moulded parts. Then, the mould closes and the process repeats.|$|E
500|$|Moulding {{tolerance}} is {{a specified}} allowance on the deviation in parameters such as dimensions, weights, shapes, or angles, etc. To maximise control in setting tolerances {{there is usually}} a minimum and maximum limit on thickness, based on the process used. Injection moulding typically is capable of tolerances equivalent to an IT Grade of about 9–14. The possible tolerance of a thermoplastic or a <b>thermoset</b> is ±0.200 to ±0.500millimetres. [...] In specialised applications tolerances as low as ±5µm on both diameters and linear features are achieved in mass production. Surface finishes of 0.0500 to 0.1000µm or better can be obtained. [...] Rough or pebbled surfaces are also possible.|$|E
