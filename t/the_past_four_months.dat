40|$|Inflation, {{especially}} in food prices, has been persistently high in India during <b>the</b> <b>past</b> twenty <b>four</b> <b>months.</b> This {{has been a}} source of concern to policy-makers. Fortunately, food price increases are now starting to ease, after the major spike that occurred in the wake of the severe drought of 2009. However, there still remains concern that we: (a) need to better understand the factors that drive such spikes in key prices; and (b) design more effective policies to prevent such future price spikes. The main approach to understanding inflation and its drivers has typically rested, on the whole, in assessing aggregate macroeconomic (aggregate supply and demand) conditions, which then typically leads to consideration of macroeconomic and monetary) policies as the principal tool to deal with inflation surges. That may indeed be appropriate in most circumstances, but is often a blunt, sometimes costly instrument that can stifle growth, especially if price pressures arise from (temporary) supply constraints. Therefore, it may be important to complement an aggregate macroeconomic analysis of inflation with microeconomic analysis: to ascertain if inflation is being driven by specific price spikes in important food and non-food commodities, which has the potential to drive other commodity prices in a cost-push manner. This paper, on global wheat market developments, price transmission and impacts on Indian domestic markets, as well as an assessment of public policies to manage domestic prices, is part of a larger effort to improve our in-house (Department of Economic Affairs) research [...] -to track, monitor and forecast fast-moving key macro-economic variables with potentially large consequences for public policy. We have begun to intensify our efforts. We are investing further systematically [...] -to understand growth and inflation dynamics in the context of rising food inflationary pressures in India and worldwide. We are capturing more high frequency data, and applying quantitative modeling tools (as evident in our current Economic Survey). We take up wheat in this paper, because of recent rapid price rises globally, as well as domestically, and because it constitutes a major element of the overall wholesale and consumer food price inflation indices. Some aspects of the price formation and policy intervention processes in wheat are also likely to be structurally similar for other similar classes of important food items (such as rice), permitting broader insights. Our paper draws upon existing theoretical insights and modeling attempts in the literature; it is, nevertheless, useful to note three “biases” in our approach: (a) favoring analysis of short-term, high-frequency price formation (daily, monthly, or quarterly), versus alternative longer-term annual, structural models; (b) favoring simplified reduced form forecasting models that track high-frequency turning points well, over more elaborate models and tests of longerduration time-series data (which may tend to be more historical and backward-looking, and less useful for short-term forecasting); and (c) assessing current India-specific public interventions in greater detail, than in more general academic papers and models. ...|$|R

40|$|Context Over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 15 years <b>the</b> causative {{genes of}} several {{inherited}} muscular dystrophies have been identified. These genes encode sarcolemmal, extracellular matrix, sarcomeric, and nuclear envelope proteins. Although the post-translational processing of muscle proteins {{has a significant}} role in their correct assembly and function, these processes have not been shown to be primarily involved in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophies until recently. In <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 18 <b>months,</b> <b>four</b> different forms of inherited muscular dystrophy in human beings have been associated with mutations in genes encoding for putative glycosyltransferases. Aberrant glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, an external membrane protein expressed in muscle, brain, and other tissues, is a common feature in these disorders. α-dystroglycan is highly glycosylated, its sugar components varying in different tissues and controlling its interaction with extracellular matrix partners. Disrupted glycosylation of α-dystroglycan results in a loss of these interactions, giving rise to both progressive muscle degeneration and abnormal neuronal migration in the brain. Starting point Kevin Campbell and colleagues have recently demonstrated that patients with muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB) and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), as well as the myodystrophy (myd) mouse, have an abnormally glycosyated form of α-dystroglycan (Nature 2002; 418 : 417 – 22 and 422 – 25). The abnormally glycosylated protein did not bind to three of its extracellular matrix ligands, laminin α 2 chain, agrin, and neurexin. The investigators also showed that a neuronal migration disorder occurs in both the myd mouse and in a brain-restricted α-dystroglycan knock-out mouse that is similar to that seen in patients with MEB and FCMD. These results identify α-dystroglycan as having an essential role in both muscle and brain development and function. Where next Emphasis is moving away from identifying the protein components of the muscle fibre that are involved in muscular dystrophies towards the post-translational processing of proteins and the enzymes involved in these modifications. This opens up new avenues of research. Abnormal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan may underlie other as yet uncharacterised forms of muscular dystrophy and neuronal migration disorders...|$|R
40|$|Over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> few <b>months,</b> <b>four</b> Central European {{states have}} made {{decisions}} which {{will determine the}} shape of their air forces over the next decade. On 11 October, Romania signed a contract under which it will buy twelve used US F- 16 A/B multi-role fighter aircraft from Portugal. In August, Slovakia signed contracts with Russia’s MiG for repairs and the limited modernisation of its twelve MiG- 29 fighter aircraft currently in service. The Czech Republic entered into a preliminary agreement in July with Sweden on extending the lease of fourteen JAS- 39 Gripen multi-role fighter aircraft (the new Czech government will hammer out the details following the parliamentary election). Bulgaria, which has been facing financial problems and political instability, in June postponed the purchase of new (non-Soviet) combat aircraft {{at least until the}} end of this year. If Sofia decides to buy any within the next few years, these will be not more than twelve relatively old and worn-out machines (most likely F- 16 A/B from Portuguese or Dutch army surplus). Given the fact that Hungary in 2012 made the same decision regarding its fourteen Gripen aircraft as the Czech Republic, there are good grounds to claim that the capabilities Central European NATO member states have to take action in airspace are durably limited. The region’s saturation with combat aircraft is the lowest when compared to the entire continent (with the exception of the Baltic states). Furthermore, the machines {{to be used in the}} coming decade will be the oldest and the least advanced technologically (all of them belong to the so-called “fourth generation”, the roots of which date back to the 1970 s). The problem with gaining full interoperability within NATO has not been resolved in its Central European member states. By modernising its MiG- 29 aircraft, Slovakia is to say the least postponing the achievement of interoperability once again. Bulgaria will gain interoperability by buying any Western combat aircraft. However, it is very unlikely to introduce new machines into service earlier than at the end of the present decade. Since the introduction of new fifth generation multi-role combat aircraft or transitional 4 + generation machines in the region’s air forces is unrealistic, the defence of the airspace of NATO member states in Central Europe can be termed an ever more porous sky...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{considered the}} relationship between Customer Perceived Value, ultimately a measurement of a firm's Value Proposition, and Value Co-creation, a recent development in Service Science that considers the joint creation of value between customers and firms rather than the traditional exchange value logic of marketing. The Value Proposition was broken down into elements of functional value (Price and Quality), Emotional Value and Social Value; while Value Co-creation was understood across the two dimensions of Value-in-use and Co-production. A descriptive research design using a quantitative methodology was employed, collecting data from 297 respondents who form part of an online opt-in research panel {{through the use of}} an online survey. Perceptions of value and Value Co-creation were collected through the use of two existing measurement instruments proposed in the academic literature, asking respondents about the service interaction they can best recall with a major South Africa clothing retailer in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> three <b>months.</b> <b>Four</b> research hypotheses were tested through the use of regression analysis, and statistically significant relationships were found between Perceived Value and Value Co-creation as well as Perceived Value and the dimensions of Co-creation, namely Value-in-use and Co-production. Moreover, Value-in-use was found to have a statistically significant greater effect on Perceived Value than Co-production. The research could not establish a differential impact of the dimensions of Co-creation on the dimensions of Perceived Value, i. e. the data did not support that Co-creation has greater impact on certain elements of the Value Proposition than others. The fourth research hypothesis considered Value-in-use as the ultimate customer outcome rather than a predictor of Perceived Value, and the statistically significant regression model provides support that Co-production can be considered an integral part of a firm's Value Proposition, rather than an underlying construct of Value Co-creation considered separately from the Value Proposition. The research contributes to the academic literature in validating two research instruments, establishing additional positive consequences of Value Co-creation and adding to the Service Innovation stream of the Value Co-creation literature. Its business implications suggest relooking the way Value Propositions are designed by adding conscious Value Co-creation as a dimension of the firm's Value Proposition, leading to enhancing the customer's Value-in-use which ultimately circles back to improve perceptions of the firm's Value Proposition.

40|$|Posttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) can include symptoms of anxiety, mood disturbance, and behavioral difficulties following {{exposure to a}} traumatic stressor such as childbirth (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Mothers of infants requiring specialty care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) immediately after birth, {{are at increased risk}} to experience PTSD in the time following childbirth (Brandon et al., 2011). NICU mothers face unique challenges including decreased ability to participate in traditional parenting roles and worry for the health of their child, and this unique stress may interfere for adjustment following childbirth (Miles, Holditch-Davis, Schwartz, & Scher, 2007). However, recent changes to the diagnostic criteria with the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) update from the DSM-IV (APA, 2000) to the DSM- 5 mean previous research has utilized diagnostic criteria that are out-of-date. Furthermore, no research exists that assesses childbirth as a traumatic stressor (PTSD Criterion A) for NICU mothers. The purpose of the current study was to test a new model of the development of PTSD symptoms specific to childbirth in a sample of NICU mothers. This model identified childbirth as a traumatic stressor in accordance with DSM- 5 diagnostic criteria and examined the influence of the unique stressors associated with NICU hospitalization on the development of PTSD following childbirth. Participants included 54 women recruited through social media who had given birth in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> one to <b>four</b> <b>months</b> whose infant was hospitalized in the NICU for at least two days. They completed an online survey assessing pregnancy and childbirth history, childbirth-specific PTSD symptoms, and stress associated with experiences in the NICU (NICU stress). Childbirth was also assessed as a potential traumatic stressor. Prior traumatic experiences and symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed as control variables. Exploratory analyses were utilized to identify the prevalence of traumatic childbirth appraisal and PTSD. Differences in prior trauma experiences and current emotional distress were examined between mothers who appraised their childbirth as traumatic and those who did not. Moderation analyses explored the influence of NICU stress on the relationship between traumatic childbirth and PTSD symptoms while accounting for prior trauma, anxiety, and depression. The proportion of NICU mothers reporting traumatic childbirth was 69 % and the proportion scoring above the clinical cutoff for PTSD was 13 %. The proportion meeting the full criteria for PTSD (reporting a traumatic childbirth and scoring above the clinical cutoff) was 20 %. The moderation analysis revealed that a significant relationship between traumatic childbirth and PTSD existed for mothers who reported both traumatic childbirth experience and high NICU stress. These results provide the first estimates of the prevalence of PTSD in NICU mothers including the assessment of traumatic childbirth. Furthermore, these results identify NICU stress as a potential treatment target to decrease PTSD symptoms following NICU hospitalization...|$|R
