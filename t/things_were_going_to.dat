2500|$|Gresham {{was born}} in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, to Claude Gresham Sr. and the former Belle Hill. He {{inherited}} his nickname from his father, a semi-professional baseball player known as [...] "Grit". Gresham grew up in rural South Carolina. As a small boy, he was so interested in hunting that he slept with his air rifle beside his bed. He took his first shot of the day out of his bedroom window. [...] "Two <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen every day when I was growing up. The sun was going to rise, and I was going to shoot something," [...] Gresham said in a 1996 interview.|$|E
60|$|They {{discussed}} Joan's plans. It {{looked as}} if <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be easy for her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Sam," [...] cried Katie, {{when she}} could, [...] "I {{knew you would}} come to rescue me. What do you suppose the mean <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do with me?" ...|$|E

500|$|... “But even still, {{this whole}} <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> under $20 million. How {{it went from}} 20 to 70, you tell me.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Writing {{six months}} before the depths of the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, he stated: [...] "I predict that <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get even worse".|$|R
6000|$|... "Wonderful {{how your}} voice came back {{just at the}} right moment. I was afraid <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be difficult. The insult did it, I think. It was a monstrous thing to say. I could have punched his head." ...|$|E
60|$|However, Dorothy now {{realized}} that <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be different with her uncle and aunt {{from this time}} forth, so after giving the matter deep thought she decided to ask Ozma to grant her a very great favor.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will never}} make an angekok," [...] said Ujarak, {{with a look}} of displeasure, [...] "if you do not rouse up your memory more. Do you not {{remember}} when I whispered to you in a dream last night that strange <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've got {{to promise}} to be good and not throw cold water on our hopes," [...] {{announced}} Jack. [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the best time ever on Snowshoe Island. And not a <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen to mar our pleasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it is not}} nonsense. You don't {{know what}} my {{feelings}} will be, if I think that such a <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen. But then you are so hard-hearted!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] he {{observed}} pleasantly, [...] "I am {{out of place}} here. Drop me a line {{and let me know}} how <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the Hotel Capitol at Washington." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{this summer}} <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{be a little}} {{different}} at Broadstone, for Mrs. Easterfield had arranged for some house parties. Her husband was very kind and considerate about her plans, and promised her {{that he would make}} one of the good company at Broadstone whenever it was possible for him to do so.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will. It's {{because it}} makes me happy--it makes me more than happy--to be with you. It makes me {{comfortable}}. You know how selfish men are? If a man feels comfortable all over with certain people, he'll bore them to death, just like a dog. You always make me feel as if pleasant <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen to me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{very anxious}} time for me, girls; of course, you must {{all of you}} see that. I'm sure when we had our party I didn't think <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be as anxious as this, or I wouldn't have had a penny spent {{in such a way}} as that. If your papa could bring himself to give up the brewery, {{everything}} would be well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will speak}} to him about you, John," [...] his master said; [...] "he is a good sort, and I dare say I can manage it. The <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done well. Three or four new carts <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> put on instead {{of some of the}} old ones, and there are ten first-rate horses coming in place of some of those that are getting past work. The stables are all being done up, and the <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done tip-top. Curiously enough his name is the same as yours, John Holl." ...|$|R
5000|$|Linguist Patricia Cukor-Avila jokingly {{states that}} [...] "eventually {{all the people}} who hate this kind of <b>thing</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dead, and the ones who use it <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in control." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so!" [...] Mr. Parker {{concluded}} triumphantly. [...] "That's {{where the}} sporting instinct comes in. You know a <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> amuse and excite you. Beyond {{that you do}} not think." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{knew what}} he would do. He would write to Garcia & Jones, his San Antonio merchants where he bought his {{supplies}} and sold his wool, and have them send down a big box of novels and reading matter for Marthy. <b>Things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be different. He wondered whether a little piano could be placed {{in one of the}} rooms of the ranch house without the family having to move out of doors.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{you wait}} {{a bit and}} let me finish! Well, I might have come now and then, found out what I could, and given you a hint or two, until we saw how <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be. But that's not my way, and I reckon it's not yours. Very well. We {{have got to have}} a talk and put the thing over. To begin with, I somehow feel I can trust you, and needn't be disturbed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word!" [...] she exclaimed, [...] "this is too bad. When other {{boarders}} came, I thought Mr. Tippengray {{would begin}} to behave like other Christians, and come to his meals at the proper time. At supper last night and breakfast this morning {{he was at the}} table as soon as anybody, and I was beginning to feel real heartened up, as if <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> run on regular and proper. But now look at that? Isn't that enough to make a housekeeper give up in despair?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} about the lawgivers," [...] said Clayton, [...] "but I have {{to say a word}} or two about the law. Do you think this kind of <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> remain?" ...|$|R
3000|$|But as n gets {{bigger and}} {{bigger and bigger}} these 2 <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get closer and closer together. Right? Yeh? [The formal idea of a limit is beyond what these {{students}} need] [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{might just}} as well tell you now, pardner," [...] said the Kid, sliding down low on his steamer chair, [...] "that <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stay just as they are. They're about right now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Modern England {{was like}} a cloud of smoke; it could carry all colours, but it could leave nothing but a stain. It was our {{weakness}} and not our strength that put a rich refuse in the sky. These were the rivers of our vanity pouring into the void. We had taken the sacred circle of the whirlwind, and looked down on it, and seen it as a whirlpool. And then we had {{used it as a}} sink. It was a good symbol of the mutiny in my own mind. Only our worst <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> heaven. Only our criminals could still ascend like angels.|$|E
60|$|Romola {{followed}} him {{and watched him}} without speaking again, as he seated himself against the tethered cow, and, when he had nervously drawn some milk, {{gave it to her}} in a brass cup he carried with him in the bucket. As Romola put the cup to the lips of the eager child, and afterwards drank some milk herself, the Padre observed her from his wooden stool with a timidity that changed its character a little. He recognised the Hebrew baby, he was certain that he had a substantial woman before him; but there was still something strange and unaccountable in Romola's presence in this spot, and the Padre had a presentiment that <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> change with him. Moreover, that Hebrew baby was terribly associated with the dread of pestilence.|$|E
60|$|The horses sweated even at walking-pace, but {{anything}} {{was better than}} sitting still in our own dark houses. When we moved off under the full moon we were four couples, one triplet, and Mr. Saumarez rode with the Copleigh girls, and I loitered at {{the tail of the}} procession, wondering with whom Saumarez would ride home. Every one was happy and contented; but we all felt that <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen. We rode slowly: and it was nearly midnight before we reached the old tomb, facing the ruined tank, in the decayed gardens where we were going to eat and drink. I was late in coming up; and before I went into the garden, I saw that the horizon to the north carried a faint, dun-colored feather. But no one would have thanked me for spoiling so well-managed an entertainment as this picnic--and a dust-storm, more or less, does no great harm.|$|E
6000|$|... "This <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a failure; {{the jokes}} in it are so dim that nobody {{will ever see}} them; I {{would like to have}} you sit in the parquette, and help me through." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I think <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get {{infinitely}} {{more complex and}} the challenge <b>is</b> about taking <b>things</b> that <b>are</b> {{infinitely more}} complex and making them simpler and more understandable." [...] Robert M. Greenberg, Head of R/GA ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be {{sure they}} will--especially after all we did for them on the Lakes," [...] put in Sam. [...] "But let me tell you, I am curious to know how this <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> end." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{met at the}} parade-ground at ten: {{the night}} was fearfully hot. The horses sweated even at walking-pace, but {{anything}} was better than sitting still in our own dark houses. When we moved off under the full moon we were four couples, one triplet, and Mr. Saumarez rode with the Copleigh girls, and I loitered at {{the tail of the}} procession, wondering with whom Saumarez would ride home.

6000|$|He observed, also, {{that there}} was a {{considerable}} change in the tone of the meeting when he informed them that he was bound on a similar errand of peace to several of the other tribes, especially to one or two tribes which were the Pawnees' bitter enemies at that time. These grasping savages having quite made up their minds that they were to obtain the entire contents of the two bales of goods, were much mortified on hearing that part was to go to other Indian tribes. Some of them even hinted that this would not be allowed, and Joe feared at one time that <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take an unfavourable turn. The hair of his scalp, as he afterwards said, [...] "began to lift a little and feel oneasy." [...] But San-it-sa-rish stood honestly to his word; said that it would be well that the Pale-faces and the Pawnees should be brothers, and hoped that they would not forget the promise of annual presents from the hand of the great chief who lived in the big village near the rising sun.|$|E
60|$|The {{king was}} {{exceedingly}} provoked at this repulse, and {{indeed it was}} a great surprise to us all, for certainly never prince began a war against the whole strength of his kingdom under the circumstances that he was in. He had not a garrison, or a company of soldiers in his pay, not a stand of arms, or a barrel of powder, a musket, cannon or mortar, not a ship of all the fleet, or money in his treasury to procure them; whereas the Parliament had all his navy, and ordnance, stores, magazines, arms, ammunition, and revenue in their keeping. And this I take to be another defect of the king's counsel, and a sad instance of the distraction of his affairs, that when he saw how all <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> wreck, as it was impossible but he should see it, and 'tis plain he did see it, that he should not long enough before it came to extremities secure the navy, magazines, and stores of war, in the hands of his trusty servants, that would have been sure to have preserved them for his use, {{at a time when he}} wanted them.|$|E
5000|$|Phelps {{severely}} {{criticizes the}} economic policy of U.S. president Donald Trump. It feels [...] "like economic policy {{at a time of}} fascism .... The leader controls the economy and tells the companies how <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That kind of <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{count in}} the new armies," [...] Dick replied. [...] "Being popular on {{guest-night}} at the mess won't help a man to hold his trench or work his gun under heavy fire." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We're due. And we're due for {{something}} big. ... Some {{things have happened}} in Afghanistan to the assassination of Massoud. I don’t like the way <b>things</b> <b>are</b> lining up in Afghanistan. ... I sense a shift, and I think <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen. ... soon".|$|R
