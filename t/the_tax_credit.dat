25|$|As {{defined by}} the 2009 ACES Act, a PEV is a vehicle which draws {{propulsion}} energy from a traction battery with at least 4 kwh of capacity and uses an offboard source of energy to recharge such battery. <b>The</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> for new plug-in electric vehicles is worth $2,500 plus $417 for each kilowatt-hour of battery capacity over 4 kwh, and {{the portion of the}} credit determined by battery capacity cannot exceed $5,000. Therefore, the maximum amount of the credit allowed for a new PEV is $7,500. Both the Nissan Leaf electric vehicle and the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, launched in December 2010, are eligible for the maximum $7,500 tax credit. The Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid, released in January 2012, is eligible for a $2,500 tax credit due to its smaller battery capacity of 5.2 kWh.
