5|$|The {{use of a}} truce term {{is usually}} {{accompanied}} by a gesture, such as crossed fingers of one or both hands or the raising of thumbs. In the US a <b>T-shape</b> made with both hands (representing time-out) has become prevalent and this gesture is also appearing in other countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{holding up}} {{of one hand}} with middle and index fingers crossed was the usual gesture found in New Zealand in 1999–2001. The <b>T-shape</b> was also used when saying {{time-out}}. The time-out gesture is made with two hands - one hand held horizontally, palm down, the other hand vertically with the fingertips touching {{the bottom of the}} horizontal hand. In the US, although the more modern time-out has largely supplanted traditional terms, often accompanied by the time-out gesture, the crossed fingers gesture remains common.|$|E
5|$|Integrated {{education}} {{models are}} {{emerging in the}} academic world, a model which {{is referred to as}} <b>T-shape</b> and π-shaped education. T-shaped professionals are taught general knowledge in a few disciplines (e.g. management and engineering) and specific, deep knowledge in a single domain (e.g. design). This model also applies to companies, when they shift their focus from small T innovations (innovations involving only one discipline, like chemists) to big T innovations (innovations involving several disciplines, like design, ethnography, lead user, etc.). Like in education, this shift makes breaking down silos of departments and disciplines of knowledge essential.|$|E

5|$|The work clearly {{distinguishes between}} {{figures of the}} divine, earthly and hellish realms. Perhaps {{following}} Jan van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece, the polyptych wings form an inverted <b>T-shape.</b> When the shutters are closed the panels resemble an upside-down cross, a form common in 15th-century carved retables: an elevated central panel allowed additional space for a narrative scene, to depict a heavenly vista, a single large figure, or a crucifixion with space for the cross to extend above the other panels, an innovation seen in van der Weyden's Descent from the Cross. This shape echoes typical configuration of Gothic churches, where the naves often extended past the aisles into the apse or choir. The imagery of the outer panels {{is set in the}} earthly realm with the donors, and saints painted in grisaille to imitate sculpture.|$|E
25|$|The design {{competition}} was won by GHM Addison, the Brisbane {{partner of the}} Melbourne-based firm Oakden, Addison and Kemp. In 1890 Addison amended his original design to a <b>T-shape,</b> incorporating a southern wing with a concert hall which could be rented out to offset repayments on the government loan. The new building was erected closer {{to the corner of}} Bowen Bridge Road and Gregory Terrace than the original building. The foundation stone was laid on 25 April 1891 and the builder, John Quinn, was required to have a section of the building completed for the August 1891 exhibition, with the whole of the building to be completed within 12 months.|$|E
25|$|The main {{building}} {{dates from the}} early 1930s, when the school moved to the site, and is characterised by its arches and clock tower in the Mission Revival architecture style. The Rudd and Hamilton wings, built in 1963, form a <b>T-shape</b> extending away from the {{main building}}, and the modern glass fronted Resource Centre, built in 1996, fills the quadrant. Other buildings on the site include McKenzie wing (built in 1983), Barbara Helen Thomson Sports Complex (opened in 1987), Birtles wing (built in 1973). The main Junior School precinct was completed in early 2008, and a separate building catering exclusively to Prep students was completed in 2007. The Junior School precinct was designed {{in light of the}} introduction of Years Prep to Grade 3 in 2007. The old College Hall (built in 1979) was demolished in late September 2009 and a brand new College Hall was constructed and opened in early June 2011. The present College Hall includes an air conditioned auditorium capable of seating 695 people, the Phil Bisset Gallery, and facilities for the music department.|$|E

Rich deposits were found associated with the ballcourt, including 21,000 potsherds, 239 pieces of obsidian, 155 fragments of ceramic figurines and 84 stone tools.|$|E
500|$|Membership of a guild {{was highly}} {{restricted}} and access {{was difficult for}} newcomers. A master was expected to serve an apprenticeship in his region, and show proof of citizenship, which could be obtained through birth in the city or by purchase. Apprenticeship lasted four to five years, ending with {{the production of a}} [...] "masterpiece" [...] that proved his ability as a craftsman, and the payment of a substantial entrance fee. The system was protectionist at a local level through the nuances of the fee system. Although it sought to ensure a high quality of membership, it was a self-governing body that tended to favour wealthy applicants. Guild connections sometimes appear in paintings, most famously in van der Weyden's Descent from the Cross, in which Christ's body is given the <b>t-shape</b> of a crossbow to reflect its commission for a chapel for the Leuven guild of archers.|$|E

500|$|Adult skulls also possess large, rugose, and oval bosses on the supraorbital region {{above the}} eyes, {{instead of the}} horns of other ceratopsids. The supraorbital bosses {{extended}} from the postorbital bone forward to incorporate the triangular palpebral and prefrontal bones, and had high transverse ridges around the middle, which were thick at their base and thin towards their top. The palpebral bones strongly stood out, forming an [...] "antorbital buttress". The fused prefrontals did not reach the nasal boss, forming a distinctive transverse sadle-shaped groove separating the nasal boss from the supraorbital bosses. This groove extended backwards, separating the supraorbital bosses {{from each other and}} forming a <b>T-shape</b> in top view. These bosses were similar to those of Pachyrhinosaurus, but with taller ridges and more pronounced rugosities. The long and low supraorbital horncores of the sub-adult specimen MOR 591 were similar to those of sub-adult Einiosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. They had a concave surface on the inner side as with Pachyrhinosaurus; ridges on the postorbital bones were present that may indicate a beginning transition to bosses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigated}} {{the conditions that}} underlie the vertical and bisection illusion in touch, {{in order to understand}} the basis of their similarity to visual illusions, and the means of reducing the biases in length perception by active touch. Movement, speed, and spatial reference cues were tested. Movements in scanning L-shapes in ipsilateral and contralateral (across the body midline) table-top space produced significant underestimation of the vertical line with the right hand, but not with the left hand. Right-handed scanning of L-shapes showed no significant bias when the vertical line in the figure was aligned to the body midline, suggesting that spatial cues were involved. The vertical line was overestimated in inverted <b>T-shapes,</b> but underestimated in rotated <b>T-shapes,</b> implicating line bisection. Holding scanning latencies constant reduced the vertical error for inverted <b>T-shapes,</b> but could not explain the bisection bias. Sectioning biases were predicted by the location of junctions on sectioned lines, showing that junction points act as misleading anchor cues for movement extents. The illusion was significantly reduced when reference information was added by instructing subjects to relate two-handed scanning of the figure to an external frame and to body-centred cues. It is argued that disparities in spatial reference (anchor) cues for movement extents are involved in vertical and bisection biases in active touch. The hypothesis that length illusions depend on disparities in spatial reference information can also account for the similarity of the tactile to the visual horizontal ^ vertical illusion. ...|$|R

2500|$|Callinectes sapidus is a decapod crab of the {{swimming}} crab family Portunidae. The genus Callinectes is distinguished from other portunid crabs {{by the lack}} of an internal spine on the carpus (the middle segment of the claw), {{as well as by the}} <b>T-shape</b> of the male abdomen. Blue crabs may grow to a carapace width of [...] C.sapidus individuals exhibit sexual dimorphism. Males and females are easily distinguished by the shape of the abdomen (known as the [...] "apron") and by color differences in the chelipeds, or claws. The abdomen is long and slender in males, but wide and rounded in mature females. A popular mnemonic is that the male's apron is shaped like the Washington Monument, while the mature female's resembles the dome of the United States Capitol. Claw color differences are more subtle than apron shape. The immovable, fixed finger of the claws in males is blue with red tips, while females have orange coloration with purple tips. A female's abdomen changes as it matures: an immature female has a triangular-shaped abdomen, whereas a mature female's is rounded.|$|E
