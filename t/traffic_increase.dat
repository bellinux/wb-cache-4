25|$|In February 2007, Sullivan {{moved his}} blog from Time to The Atlantic Monthly, {{where he had}} {{accepted}} an editorial post. His presence was estimated to have contributed as much as 30% of the subsequent <b>traffic</b> <b>increase</b> for The Atlantics website.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to a large}} <b>traffic</b> <b>increase</b> {{since the}} late 1990s, more bridges are needed to avoid traffic jams on and around already {{existing}} bridges. Specifically, the central rail route from the central railway terminal via the Darnytskyi Bridge is overloaded, limiting the railroad traffic in Eastern Europe.|$|E
25|$|Many Internet users {{responded to}} the incident; the {{resulting}} web traffic set records for Internet activity at the time. CNN's traffic quadrupled to 3.9 million hits per day. After the tragedy, the website of The New York Times saw its <b>traffic</b> <b>increase</b> to 1.5 million hits per day, 50% higher than its previous rate. In 1996, few U.S. government websites were updated daily, but the United States Navy's crash website was constantly updated and had detailed information about the salvage of the crash site.|$|E
50|$|Road {{transport}} {{has grown}} rapidly in recent years. Freight <b>traffic</b> <b>increased</b> from 1 million tons.km in 2000 to 21.3 tons.km in 2007, while passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>increased</b> from 4.4 to 16.7 million passenger km.|$|R
50|$|During 2015, <b>traffic</b> <b>increased</b> to 3,366,560 passengers.|$|R
2500|$|During the Soviet era, freight rail <b>traffic</b> <b>increased</b> 55 times (over {{that of the}} Russian empire {{just before}} World War I), {{passenger}} <b>traffic</b> <b>increased</b> almost 10 times, {{and the length of}} the rail network almost doubled. [...] The Soviet Union had a railway network of [...] (excluding industrial railways), of which [...] were electrified.|$|R
25|$|For {{several years}} the only airline service was from Northwest Airlines, {{commuter}} service on Northwest Airlink to Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. In October 2007, Frontier Airlines began service with two daily flights between its Denver hub and Sioux City. The new service from Frontier quickly expanded to three daily non-stop flights to Denver and helped passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>increase</b> by over 150%. In April 2008 Frontier {{announced it would}} be ending service to Sioux City on May 12, citing economic conditions after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War II caused the railroads of the United States {{to see a}} sharp rise in traffic. Even before the imposition of rationing of fuel and rubber made auto travel difficult, the North Shore saw its freight and passenger traffic rise to record levels, {{in part due to}} the railroad serving important military facilities: the Army's Fort Sheridan just north of Highwood, and the Navy's Great Lakes Naval Training Station, just south of North Chicago. North Shore saw its <b>traffic</b> <b>increase</b> {{to the extent that the}} railroad was forced to borrow equipment from the Chicago Rapid Transit Company and fellow interurban Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad, both former Insull properties.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{impact of}} {{electrification}} {{would be a}} severe cut in operating costs of the railway companies, and thus better margins for forest owners, who could increase their export. A secondary impact would allow the Rorøs Line to also handle intermodule transport. Cargo trains could run directly from Gothenburg to Trondheim, via the Norway/Vänern, Värmland, Solør and Røros Lines, bypassing the congested cargo lines through Oslo. Intermodule cargo trains operate from Oslo to Trondheim via the Dovre Line, despite its higher elevation, because of the electric traction. If the Solør and Røros Lines were electrified, they could act as a reserve for the Dovre Line. This is not a possibility today because the train companies lack diesel locomotives. Further <b>traffic</b> <b>increase</b> could be handled through operating northbound trains along the Solør/Røros Line and southbound via the Dovre Line.|$|E
50|$|The new railway line radically {{changed the}} modal split between Madrid and Seville. The share of air traffic {{decreased}} between 1991 and 1994 from 40% to 13%; the combined share of car and bus decreased from 44% to 36%. The share of railway <b>traffic</b> <b>increased</b> from 16% to 51%, while total <b>traffic</b> <b>increased</b> by 35%.|$|R
50|$|Traffic {{levels on}} the route {{exploded}} {{during the first year}} of the war. Freight traffic doubled, and passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>increased</b> sixfold. <b>Traffic</b> <b>increased</b> steadily in both categories over the next few years of the war. In response to this, the Western Pacific installed Centralized Traffic Control between Oroville and Portola, California, in the Sierra Nevada, during 1944 and 1945.|$|R
5000|$|During the Soviet era, freight rail <b>traffic</b> <b>increased</b> 55 times (over {{that of the}} Russian empire {{just before}} World War I), {{passenger}} <b>traffic</b> <b>increased</b> almost 10 times, {{and the length of}} the rail network almost doubled. [...] The Soviet Union had a railway network of 147,400 km (excluding industrial railways), of which 53,900 km were electrified.|$|R
25|$|The primary {{traffic was}} sawn timber and firewood, with many sawmills located {{adjacent}} to the railway, or accessed by short tramways. Seasonally heavy potato traffic and a lime kiln added to revenue. Traffic grew to require up to 7 trains a day each way by the mid-1920s. The introduction of the Garratt locomotive allowed a new timetable with two trains each way between Colac and Beech Forest, and a third train each way to Gellibrand. The Crowes branch saw a single mixed train daily. The arrival of the Great Depression and competition from motor vehicles saw traffic decline {{to a point where}} only one train each way operated over the line three days a week. Increased wartime loadings saw <b>traffic</b> <b>increase</b> to two trains each way daily, however this improvement was only temporary. By the time the railway closed, the timetable listed only one train each way a week, and most of the traffic was pulpwood.|$|E
500|$|After {{six months}} operation, the service had {{experienced}} a 40% <b>traffic</b> <b>increase.</b> On 15 November 1994, the Trøndelag Commuter Rail became the first airport rail link in the Nordic Countries, when a new terminal and Trondheim Airport Station opened at Trondheim Airport, Værnes. NSB stated that their primary goal was not {{to compete with the}} four hourly airport coaches which operated to the hotels in Trondheim, but instead to provide services to communities in Nord-Trøndelag and south of Trondheim. The investment at the airport cost [...]|$|E
2500|$|Over time, {{the amount}} of Usenet traffic has {{steadily}} increased. [...] the number of all text posts made in all Big-8 newsgroups averaged 1,800 new messages every hour, {{with an average of}} 25,000 messages per day. However, these averages are minuscule in comparison to the traffic in the binary groups. Much of this <b>traffic</b> <b>increase</b> reflects not an increase in discrete users or newsgroup discussions, but instead the combination of massive automated spamming and an increase in the use of [...]binaries newsgroups in which large files are often posted publicly. A small sampling of the change (measured in feed size per day) follows: ...|$|E
50|$|On March 16, 1930, the TTC {{closed the}} Lake Simcoe (formerly Metropolitan) line after radial car 74 from Thornhill arrived in Toronto at 1:15 am. The line had been losing money for years, and road {{competition}} {{was the major}} factor. Between 1925 and 1930, auto and truck <b>traffic</b> <b>increased</b> along Yonge Street from 4,925 to 11,163 per day, and bus <b>traffic</b> <b>increased</b> from 2 to 188 per day.|$|R

2500|$|The rate of <b>traffic</b> <b>increase</b> in the Greater Bristol {{area has}} been up to three times the {{national}} average, and during peak time 50% of motorway traffic is local. [...] Without intervention the council predicts that between 2006 and 2016 an additional 20,000 people would be commuting in cars. [...] Average peak time speeds in Bristol are 16mph (26km/h), the lowest of the eight English [...] "core cities", with 23% of journey times spent stationary, costing the local economy £350 million per year. [...] Cars are used for 45% of journeys under 2km, and 68% of 2–5km journeys. [...] The dormitory towns of Weston-super-Mare, Clevedon and Portishead, which have good connections to the M5, but poor public transport systems, contribute to the congestion, and have growing populations.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2013, DuckDuckGo {{indicated}} that it had seen a significant traffic increase; according to the website's Twitter account, on Monday June 17, 2013, it had three million daily direct searches. On average during May 2013, it had 1.8 million daily direct searches. Some relate this claim to the exposure of PRISM and {{to the fact that}} other programs operated by the National Security Agency (NSA) were leaked by Edward Snowden. Danny Sullivan wrote on Search Engine Land that despite the search engine's growth [...] "it's not grown anywhere near the amount to reflect any substantial or even mildly notable switching by the searching public" [...] for reasons due to privacy, and he concluded [...] "No One Cares About [...] "Private" [...] Search". In response, Caleb Garling of the San Francisco Chronicle argued: [...] "I think this thesis suffers from a few key failures in logic" [...] because a <b>traffic</b> <b>increase</b> had occurred and because {{there was a lack of}} widespread awareness of the existence of DuckDuckGo. Later in September 2013, the search engine hit 4 million searches per day. On March 23, 2015, DuckDuckGo retrieved more than 9 million searches for the first day in its history. That month also saw the search engine retrieve more than 250 million searches, another record for the company. In August 2017, the average number of queries per day was 16 million.|$|E
50|$|Between 1994 and 2010, Thessaloniki Airport saw {{a rise in}} {{passenger}} traffic equal to 76%, from 2.2 million in 1994 to 3.9 million in 2010. Between 2003 and 2008 the airport saw a passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>increase</b> of 19.1% from 3.5 million to almost 4.2 million passengers, an all-time high. The number of passengers dropped in next years. However, {{over the last two}} years the airport experienced passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>increase</b> to just above four million by 2013. Significant <b>traffic</b> <b>increase</b> took place during 2014, with the total number of passengers exceeding the five million mark for the first time.|$|E

50|$|Only a {{few years}} after the {{delivery}} of X36, a further <b>traffic</b> <b>increase</b> meant additional engines were needed. Clyde Engineering was the only company to submit a tender for the contract (63420) by the closing date of 30 April 1969.|$|E
50|$|In 2004 the school's {{attendance}} boundary, {{along with}} that of Travis Elementary School of Woodland Heights, was modified due to a vehicular <b>traffic</b> <b>increase</b> on Studewood Street, affecting 20 children.
