5|$|Bridgwater was {{selected}} as the first town in the South West, outside Bristol, to be selected for the UK government's Building Schools for the Future (BSF) initiative, which aimed to rebuild and renew nearly every secondary school in England. Within Bridgwater, BSF was to redevelop all of the four secondary schools and two special provision schools at an expected cost of around £100 million. This included the complete relocation and rebuilding of a new school combining <b>the</b> <b>both</b> Haygrove and Penrose School. In July 2010, several components of the Bridgwater BSF programme were cancelled and others were singled out for further review. Following a meeting with Education Secretary Michael Gove, Bridgwater MP Ian Liddell-Granger announced that the fate of all six affected schools would be subject to review, including the ones that were cancelled.|$|E

SAT offered Sisu chassis to replace the Vanaja models, but a number of bus operators, including TKL, rejected them.|$|E
5|$|In early January 2015, Ranariddh {{expressed}} his intent {{to return to}} FUNCINPEC. At the party congress held on 19 January 2015, Ranariddh was reappointed as FUNCINPEC president, succeeding Arunrasmy who was appointed as its first vice-president, while Nhek Bun Chhay was appointed as second vice-president. However, rifts between Nhek Bun Chhay and Ranariddh quickly surfaced as <b>the</b> <b>both</b> of them sparred with {{each other over the}} right to use the party stamp and the appointment of Say Hak as the party's secretary general. Ranariddh eventually gained the upper hand, and Say Hak's appointment was reaffirmed at another party congress held in March 2015. He also managed to convince party delegates present at the congress to adopt a new party logo. At the same time, Ranariddh appointed four more vice-presidents to the party's executive committee, namely You Hockry, Por Bun Sreu, Nuth Sokhom and Nhep Bun Chin.|$|E

5|$|The {{triangular}} pediment depicts {{sculptures of}} plants and geometrical figures. The staircase has nine unusually high steps— high, about {{twice as high as}} the average height of stairs. Tananyan suggests that the unusually high stairs compel a person ascending the staircase to feel humbled and make physical effort to reach the altar. On <b>the</b> <b>both</b> sides of the staircase there are roughly square pedestals. Atlas, the Greek mythological Titan who held up the earth, is sculpted on both pedestals in a way seemingly trying to hold the entire temple on its shoulders. It is assumed that, originally, pedestals held up altars (sacrificial tables).|$|E
5|$|As {{in many of}} his {{previous}} pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group {{of the scientific community}} and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful {{due to a lack of}} concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of <b>the</b> <b>both</b> bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members—such as Burnet—being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.|$|E
5|$|By 1919, the {{influence}} of Chinese Civil War had spread to Sarawak when Kuomintang set up its first branches in Sibu and Kuching. Charles Brooke opposed such political activity by the local Chinese and had expelled several local Kuomintang leaders. However, Charles Vyner Brooke was more receptive of such activities by local Chinese. The local Chinese also participated in a donation drive to aid Kuomintang in its fight against Japanese invasion on China mainland. After World War II ended, local Kuomintang leaders supported the cessation of Sarawak to British as Crown Colony but the local communist leaders were against it. Clashes between the communist and the Kuomintang supporters were common. The Kuomintang branches in Sarawak were finally dissolved in 1949 when the party lost a war on China mainland to the Communist party and retreated to Taiwan. However, clashes between <b>the</b> <b>both</b> sides continued until 1955 when Kuomintang's newspaper was banned by the colonial British government in May 1951; while Communist's newspapar ceased to exist in 1955 due to financial difficulties.|$|E

Mulder, sitting with Melissa in the hospital cafeteria, is asked by a woman for change for the cigarette machine. When she says that a pack of Morleys is already there and leaves, Mulder opens it and finds the Cigarette Smoking Man's address inside. Mulder bursts into the Cigarette Smoking Man's home and holds him at gunpoint, demanding to know why Scully was taken instead of him. The Cigarette Smoking Man claims he likes <b>the</b> <b>both</b> of them, which is why she was returned; he reveals that he told Skinner it was Mulder who shot {{the man in the}} parking lot, although he didn't believe this to be true, incidentally revealing himself as unaware of who did shoot the man, namely X.

5|$|Knowing that Angel {{has been}} cursed {{so that if}} he ever {{experiences}} pure happiness, he will once again lose his soul, Darla later returns and sleeps with him, but her plot fails; being with her only brings Angel despair, {{as well as providing}} him with a new understanding of his role as a champion. Their one-night stand leads to an unexpected development for <b>the</b> <b>both</b> of them: Darla reappears in season three, pregnant with Angel's child, despite the fact that vampires cannot normally conceive. Her pregnancy allows Darla to experience emotions that had previously been lost to her {{in the presence of the}} human soul of her unborn child. Admitting that creating life with Angel was the only good thing they ever did together, Darla makes sure Angel will relay that to their child before she stakes herself through the heart, sacrificing her life so their son, Connor, can be born. Darla turns to dust, but the baby remains. Darla later appears as a spirit, trying to persuade her son in an effort to save him from the renegade deity Jasmine's manipulations, as the latter's actions are bringing Connor into the same dark path both Darla and Angel had taken.|$|E
5|$|Rhonda Latimer, {{an aging}} {{reporter}} for Fox News Channel who is idolized by viewers {{because of her}} good looks, is dismissed when the network's first high-definition broadcast exposes her wrinkles, leaving a job opportunity open. Lois auditions for the part, ignoring Brian's warnings that Fox News is a heavily biased network, and she is chosen as the new reporter. On her first day reporting, she is assigned to do an exposé on Michael Moore {{to prove that he}} is a homosexual. When she spies on him outside his house, she sees Rush Limbaugh coming out, leading her to conclude that Limbaugh and Moore are in a gay relationship. However, Fox News refuses to allow any material against fellow conservative Limbaugh to be broadcast, leading Lois to realize that Brian was right about them. The two decide to take the story into their own hands and confront who they expect to be Moore and a naked Limbaugh in the same bedroom, only to discover that <b>the</b> <b>both</b> of them are portrayed by Fred Savage, who has created bodysuits of them in order to continue his acting career. A flabbergasted Lois ultimately decides to report his story instead.|$|E

5|$|The American white ibis {{prefers to}} eat {{crayfish}} and other crustaceans, but also takes aquatic insects and small fish. Outside the nesting season, the diet is highly variable, as abundance {{and types of}} prey depend on <b>the</b> <b>both</b> region and habitat. In Los Llanos, located {{on the border of}} Colombia and Venezuela, the most frequent prey are insects, such as fly larvae and beetles. Generally in North America the main prey are crustaceans, mostly crayfish. In the Everglades and cypress swamps, the diet is primarily made up of crayfish, while those that feed in willow ponds eat predominantly fish. American white ibises that feed in mangrove swamps focus on crabs. The tactile nature of the ibis's probing for food in mud means that it catches prey that are too slow to evade the ibis once located by its bill. In the Everglades, this means that crayfish make up {{a large part of the}} diet, but a more diverse array of invertebrates are taken in coastal areas. Although crayfish are sought by foraging ibises, prey switching to fish does occur if fish are found in great abundance. It is unclear whether the fish are more easily caught if overcrowded, or whether sheer numbers of fish mean that ibises are catching them instead of crayfish—normally, fish are more agile than crayfish and hence elude the ibis's bill more easily. Fish are a more energy-rich source of food for the American white ibis. In the breeding season, American white ibises in a colony at Pumpkinseed Island travelled further to forage in freshwater wetlands and catch crayfish, than nearby saltwater areas where fiddler crabs predominated, indicating their benefit was worth the extra energy expended in fetching them for their young. This travel results in the wholesale transport of nutrients across the landscape by the colony; in a successful breeding year the colony at Pumpkinseed Island was estimated to have contributed a third as much phosphorus to the neighboring estuary as other environmental processes.|$|E
5|$|The Class 93 was {{put into}} service {{as part of the}} Agenda {{regional}} train concept. Along with the Class 70 InterCity Express trains in Eastern Norway, the Class 93 would serve the regional services of NSB. Trains were initially put into service in 2000 on the Nordland Line, followed by the Rauma and Røros Line. The trains had several operational problems, some related to humidity, creating situations where <b>the</b> <b>both</b> engines would stop. This caused NSB in 2002 to demand an interior and technical reconfiguration by Bombardier. One year after delivery, six of eleven trains were out of order. To solve the problem, NSB had to rent back used Di3 locomotives from Ofotbanen. NSB had chosen to sell the old locomotives for less than market price, but Ofotbanen demanded that NSB pay the entire purchase price for the short-term rental back. The brand name Agenda failed, since customers were dissatisfied with the new stock, and NSB chose to discontinue the branding, just calling all former Agenda and Signatur trains regional trains.|$|E
