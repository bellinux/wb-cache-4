40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} stimulate the {{potential}} cementitious property of granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS), the ground GBFS sample (Wei Fang Iron and Steel Corporation, China) was activated by lime and gypsum under different dosages. The results showed that lime is an effective activator for the slag, and the optimum dosage of lime is about 10 % (w/w) of the slag. At the optimum dosage of lime, the 28 days compressive strength of <b>the</b> lime-slag <b>paste</b> is {{higher than that of}} 32. 5 ordinary Portland cement (OPC). But, the early age strength (3 and 7 days compressive strength) of <b>the</b> lime-slag <b>paste</b> is lower than that of the OPC. Addition of gypsum can effectively improve the early age strength of <b>the</b> lime-slag <b>paste.</b> At <b>the</b> ratio of gypsum:lime:slag of 8. 2 : 9. 2 : 82. 6 (w/w), both the early and long-term compressive strengths of <b>the</b> gypsum-lime-slag <b>paste</b> are higher than that of the OPC. According to XRD, TG-DTA and SEM detections of the hydration products of <b>the</b> lime-slag <b>paste,</b> <b>the</b> gypsum-lime-slag <b>paste</b> and <b>the</b> OPC <b>paste,</b> it reveals that the hydration process of the GBFS-based cementitious material is different from the ordinary Portland cement and the presence of ettringite (AFt) contributes to the early age strength of <b>the</b> <b>pastes.</b> <b>The</b> major hydration product of <b>the</b> OPC <b>paste</b> (< 7 days) were measured as ettringite (AFt), but the AFt phase was not detected in the hydration product of <b>the</b> lime-slag <b>paste</b> and <b>the</b> major hydration product of <b>the</b> lime-slag <b>paste</b> was determined as amorphous CSH gel. However, AFt was detected in the hydration products of <b>the</b> gypsum-lime-slag <b>paste</b> in <b>the</b> early stages of hydration, and the formation of AFt is favorable for the early strength improvement of the material...|$|R

In {{the present study}} the possible interaction of three different hydrocolloids- guar gum, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) and xanthan gum- with rice starch was explored by determining <b>the</b> <b>pasting,</b> viscoelastic and swelling properties of the rice starch-hydrocolloids mixtures. The impact of successive heating-cooling cycles on <b>the</b> <b>pasting,</b> viscoelasticity and swelling was also determined. Hydrocolloids tested in the range 0. 2 - 0. 8 % (w/w) significantly modified <b>the</b> <b>pasting,</b> viscoelastic and swelling properties of rice starch-hydrocolloid pastes (8 %, w/w) {{and the extent of}} the effect was dependent on hydrocolloid concentration. Guar and xanthan gum mixtures with rice starch had the greatest effect on <b>the</b> <b>pasting</b> properties, whereas HPMC mixtures only changed the viscosity during cooling. <b>The</b> starch-hydrocolloids <b>pastes</b> formed weaker gels compared to those of the starch alone.

The components were diluted and tested on fifteen standard strains of microorganisms associated with endodontic diseases. The microorganisms were cultivated and after incubation data was analysed using One-Way ANOVA and Turkey's test (P&# 8804; 0. 05). Four superior incisors of ten animals were used to evaluate dentin bridge formation. Two incisors were capped with paste A (GA) and two with paste B (GB). After 90 days, the teeth were extracted for histological analysis {{and the degree of}} dentin bridge formation evaluated. Data was analysed by the Kruskal-Wallis test (P< 0. 05). <b>The</b> <b>pastes</b> and their components were classified in the following decreasing order of antimicrobial action: calcium hydroxide P.

40|$|Developers {{often need}} to modify pasted code when {{programming}} with copy-and-paste practice. Some modifications on pasted code could involve lots of editing efforts, and any missing or wrong edit could incur bugs. In this paper, we propose a clone-based and interactive approach to recommending {{where and how}} to modify <b>the</b> <b>pasted</b> code. In our approach, we regard clones of <b>the</b> <b>pasted</b> code as <b>the</b> results of historical copy-and-paste operations and their differences as historical modifications on the same piece of code. Our approach first retrieves clones of <b>the</b> <b>pasted</b> code from a clone repository and detects syntactically complete differences among them. Then our approach transfers each clone difference into a modification slot on <b>the</b> <b>pasted</b> code, suggests options for each slot, and further mines modifying regulations from the clone dif-ferences. Based on the mined modifying regulations, our approach dynamically updates the suggested options and their ranking in each slot according to developerâ€™s modifications on <b>the</b> <b>pasted</b> code. We implement a proof-of-concept tool CCDemon based on our ap-proach and evaluate its effectiveness based on code clones detected from five open source projects. The results show that our approach can identify 96. 9 % of the to-be-modified positions in pasted code and suggest 75. 0 % of the required modifications. Our human study further confirms that CCDemon can help developers to accomplish their modifications of pasted code more efficiently...|$|R
