5|$|Mr. McGregor {{does not}} notice the substitution, and carries the sack home, {{continually}} counting the six rabbits. His wife claims the skins for herself, intending to line her old cloak with them. But when she {{reaches into the}} sack and feels the vegetables and discovers them, she becomes very, very, angry. Then, as a result, she accuses her husband of playing a trick with her. And Mr. Mc Gregor becomes very angry too, and he throws a rotten vegetable marrow out through the window, hitting {{the youngest of the}} eavesdropping bunnies who has been sitting on the window-sill (leaving the Mc Gregors to argue). Their parents decide it is <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> At Christmas, they send the heroic little wood mouse a quantity of rabbit-wool. She makes herself a cloak and a hood, and a muff and mittens.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Ekholm was {{skeptical of the}} balloon's ability to retain hydrogen, from his own measurements. His {{buoyancy}} checks {{in the summer of}} 1896, during the process of producing the hydrogen and pumping it into the balloon, convinced him that the balloon leaked too much to ever reach the Pole, let alone go on to Russia or Canada. The worst leakage came from the approximately eight million tiny stitching holes along the seams, which no amount of glued-on strips of silk or applications of special secret-formula varnish seemed to seal. The balloon was losing 68kilograms (150lb) of lift force a day. Taking into account its heavy load, Ekholm estimated that it would be able to stay airborne for 17 days at most, not 30. When it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> he warned Andrée that he would not take part in the next attempt, scheduled for summer 1897, unless a stronger, better-sealed balloon was bought.|$|E
25|$|<b>Time</b> <b>to</b> <b>Go</b> <b>Home,</b> Nash, 1972.|$|E
60|$|It {{was clearly}} <b>time</b> for them <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> so away they all went.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Tippengray," [...] {{she said}} presently, [...] "it is <b>time</b> for us <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> How {{would you like}} to take Ida Mayberry back in your cart?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Robin," [...] said Sam, with a {{tremendous}} yawn, [...] "as we've seen the first act in the play, it is <b>time,</b> I think, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> bed." ...|$|R
60|$|THEN Benjamin and Flopsy {{thought that}} it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is too much!' said Lord Martindale. 'Arthur, go, {{and tell}} her it is high <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> and she must let the poor child off.' ...|$|E
60|$|During the day, at {{his work}} in the office, he kept himself suspended. He did not exist. He worked {{automatically}} till it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you think," [...] said Miss Harriet, {{taking a}} seat {{opposite}} the old lady, [...] "that {{it is about}} <b>time</b> for you <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and attend <b>to</b> your affairs?" ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{last the}} <b>time</b> came <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> In 1890 {{he still had}} the Bar Exam to take. He found some {{tutoring}} work at Balliol and was secretary to Toynbee Hall while he studied for the exam, took, and passed it. [...] When the results were announced in early 1891, he was free to begin his professional career. He was awarded the Master of Arts (M.A.) later that year without additional work or examination, as was the custom at Oxford.|$|R
6000|$|... "So we can," [...] said {{both of the}} boys; {{and they}} {{immediately}} <b>went</b> <b>to</b> work collecting branches and weaving them in, leaving a space for a window both sides. Their quarrelsome feelings were all gone, and they talked very pleasantly at their work until it was <b>time</b> for them <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> dinner.|$|R
60|$|When the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> came Frances felt dull. She {{hated to}} leave Windy Meadows and Corona and her dear shore people and Aunt Eleanor and--and--well, Margaret Ann Peabody.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{will give}} me <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> pack my valise, and arrange my affairs," [...] said Mr. Harrison. [...] "Come, you can go with me, and we can dine together." ...|$|E
60|$|Juliette spent a happy day; {{she loved}} the flowers, the trees, the birds, and Pétronelle was silent and sympathetic. As the {{afternoon}} wore on, and it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> Juliette turned townwards with a sigh.|$|E
50|$|After {{eliminating}} Justin, {{the teams}} {{return to the}} ranch and Kaylee apologizes for believing her time had come. She re-commits herself to being at the ranch and realizes {{that it is not}} <b>time</b> for her <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and that she still has a lot to learn from the ranch, her teammates and her trainers.|$|R
60|$|After this, Rollo gave Waldron some further {{accounts}} {{of what he}} saw at the castle; but before he got quite through with his descriptions Mr. George came, {{and said it was}} <b>time</b> for them <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> So they both bade Waldron good by. Rollo said, however, that it was not his final good by.|$|R
60|$|At last, it was <b>time</b> for Henry <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> and Rollo {{concluded}} {{to leave}} his bee-hive until the next morning. He thought he would leave the hole stopped up, so that the bees might get used to their new accommodations; but he intended to open it the next day, in order to let them begin their work.|$|R
60|$|But it {{was about}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> He had better catch a train. All the {{time there was a}} steady bruise at the bottom of his soul, but so steady as to be forgettable. He caught a train for Ilkeston.|$|E
60|$|When it came <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> {{the girls}} were {{somewhat}} timid, and Jessie said she could telephone for the sleigh. But, {{as it was a}} bright, starry night, the boys said they would rather walk, and Laura said the same.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile {{the king}} and queen sat lazily among the heather, and an hour or two slipped away. The sun was {{dropping}} towards the horizon, and they began to think it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> So they called to their daughters and called again, but no one answered them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] said Nan. [...] "That isn't {{the way it}} goes at all. Bertie Shakespeare {{can never}} get {{anything}} straight. I know the whole story and I'll tell it <b>to</b> you some <b>time,</b> but not now, for it's too long and it's <b>time</b> for us <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> Mother doesn't like us to be out late these damp evenings." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ian shows a {{breadth of}} skills {{throughout}} his tenure with the Doctor. He manages to create fire (An Unearthly Child), rides a horse, {{knows how to}} fight with swords (The Romans) and is knowledgeable about pressure points that can paralyse an opponent (The Aztecs). He is also fiercely protective of Barbara, going on a lone mission to rescue her from Saracens in The Crusade. In that story, he is also knighted by King Richard I of England as [...] "Sir Ian of Jaffa". After many travels, Ian and Barbara eventually use a Dalek <b>time</b> machine <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> two years after their disappearance.|$|R
6000|$|Alfred did {{not seem}} to take in much comfort, and Jane did not believe she was putting it rightly; but it was <b>time</b> for her <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> so she said anxiously, 'Good-bye, Alfred; I hope you'll be better next time--and--and--' She bent down and spoke in a very frightened whisper, 'You know when we <b>go</b> <b>to</b> church, we pray you may have {{patience}} under your sufferings.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ran, did he? H'm! Well, it's {{considerably}} {{later than}} his usual <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> to his Alfuro wife; {{but to be}} seen running {{is a sort of}} degradation for Wang, who has mastered the art of vanishing. Do you think he was startled out of his perfection by something?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There the sprite had decidedly the advantage. You could [...] "gar her greet," [...] but {{you could}} not [...] "gar her know." [...] She had only to hold out; and when Miss Martindale found it <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> to dinner, and began to grow ashamed of her position, the victory was hers.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no,' said Barnet; 'I am {{not at all}} prepared; but I thought I {{would look}} in upon you for a moment, even though I had not <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and dress. I'll stand back and see you pass out, and observe {{the effect of the}} {{spectacle}} upon myself as one of the public.' ...|$|E
50|$|After three years, Karl was in Turkey {{and tried}} {{once more to}} get a visa for {{entrance}} into Iran. The Iran government turned him down for the third time. At that <b>time,</b> he decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> He shipped his motorcycle to Baltimore, Maryland and then continued his journey from Washington, D.C. across the United States, riding only on the backroads, not on interstate highways, and returned to Newport Beach, California.|$|R
60|$|At length, {{the water}} in the pool began to subside gradually, and then it did not run so fast through the canal; and pretty soon after this, Jonas said he thought it was <b>time</b> for them <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> dinner. So Rollo put up his {{raspberry}} seeds in a paper, and put them into his pocket, and carried his hornets' nest in his hand. Jonas took the dipper and the lantern, and thus the boys walked along together.|$|R
50|$|On October 12, 1911, Hickey, then {{employed}} as a steel plant supervisor in Lackawanna, New York, noticed seven-year-old Joey Joseph playing at his father's men's furnishing store. Later, when Joey was making mud puddles with {{a friend in the}} street near his house, Hickey motioned to them to join him. He gave Joey a few pennies to buy candy for himself and his friend. Upon Joey's return, Hickey abruptly told his friend that it was <b>time</b> for him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Hullo, I say, Cap, wake up, old boy," [...] shouted my new friend. [...] "Quite <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> don't you know. That's right--up you come. Now let me {{introduce}} you to Mr. Lamb. I'm sure he's an acquisition. What, off again! Damn it, old Cloud, that's unreasonable, {{to say the least}} of it." ...|$|E
60|$|The Bee was mollified. He {{gave his}} arm to the Spider; then all the company went off to sup in a {{neighbouring}} glade. Shall we describe the supper? We think not. It was beyond description delightful. Just as it was finished the moon rose from behind a cloud, so the company {{knew that it was}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
60|$|She felt strong. Whenever she was restless she dodged her {{thoughts}} by the familiar vagabond fallacy of {{running away from}} them, of moving on to a new place, and thus she persuaded herself that she was tranquil. In March she willingly agreed with Kennicott that it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> She was longing for Hugh.|$|E
6000|$|I was a {{great deal}} younger than he, but there was {{something}} so simple and communicative in his tone, so expressive of a desire to fraternise and so exempt from any theory of human differences, that I quite forgot his seniority and found myself offering him paternal advice. “Don’t think about all that. Simply enjoy yourself, amuse yourself, get well. Travel about and see Europe. At the end of a year, by the <b>time</b> you’re ready <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> things will have improved over there, and you’ll be quite well and happy.” ...|$|R
50|$|Ben's friends, Adam (John Hensley) and Bruno (David Denman), {{are killed}} by Megumi. After {{witnessing}} Bruno's death, Ben wants to leave but Jane hands Ben their wedding photo, which shows a distorted picture of Megumi. They realize she's been with them the entire <b>time</b> and <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Megumi's <b>home,</b> only to find her decayed body. She had committed suicide with potassium cyanide long before the car impact and thus they had actually first encountered her as a ghost at that time.|$|R
2500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of a chase through time by Daleks, Ian and Barbara used the Dalek <b>time</b> machine <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> (The Chase), and their place in the TARDIS was taken by a future space pilot named Steven Taylor, who had been captured by the robot Mechanoids but escaped due to the Dalek attack. [...] The Doctor met another member of his own race {{for the first time in}} the form of the Meddling Monk and had an adventure in Galaxy 4. During the siege of Troy, Vicki decided to leave the TARDIS to stay with Troilus, adopting the name Cressida. The Doctor and Steven were next briefly joined by Trojan slave Katarina and a security agent from 4000 AD Sara Kingdom, but both were killed during the events of The Daleks' Master Plan, where the Daleks plotted to invade Earth's Solar System in 4000 AD, before being destroyed when the Doctor activated their weapon the <b>Time</b> Destructor. Due <b>to</b> this he was aged significantly; the effects on Sara were enough to reduce her to dust.|$|R
