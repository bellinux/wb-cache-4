40|$|Optimization of the fibre-matrix {{interphase}} {{region is}} critical to achieving the required performance level in <b>thermoplastic</b> matrix <b>composites.</b> Due to its initial location on the fibre surface, the sizing layer {{is an important component}} in the formation and properties of the composite interphase. Consequently, any attempt to understand the science of the composite interphase must encompass an understanding of the science of sizing. In this paper the role of sizings from fibre manufacture through to performance of composite parts is reviewed. In particular the role of organosilane coupling agents and how the formation of a polysiloxane interphase is influenced by the surface properties of the fibre is examined.

40|$|Continuous {{ultrasonic}} welding of plastic films, fabrics, and even <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>composite</b> prepreg tape {{is a common}} industrial practice. However, continuous {{ultrasonic welding}} of stiff <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>composite</b> plates is challenging due to squeeze flow of resin at the welding interface, and significant local deformation of the welding stack, that are generally needed to achieve strong welds. This paper presents a novel approach to continuous ultrasonic welding of <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>composite</b> plates based on zero-flow welding. The proposed technique can create strong welds before any squeeze flow {{takes place at the}} interface. It is enabled by the use of very thin flat energy directors, owing to simultaneous melting of both energy director and adherends’ matrix.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and validate a predictive modelling methodology for simulating the static and dynamic impact failure response of <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>composite</b> sandwich structures. The work has primarily focused on sandwich constructions with commingled woven fabric glass/polypropylene composite skins and a crushable polypropylene foam core. The static and high strain rate mechanical properties of the <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>composite</b> skin material have been experimentally characterised. This investigation showed that the tensile and compressive modulus and strength increased with strain rate while the shear modulus and strength decreased as strain rate increased. A modelling methodology was developed for predicting damage in the <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>composite</b> using the advanced MAT 162 material model that is implemented in the LS-DYNA explicit finite element code. An inverse modelling technique for calibrating and validating the MAT 162 damage parameters was developed. The material model was validated for predictive simulation of the static and crash response of a large scale complex shaped demonstrator <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>composite</b> automotive component. The static and dynamic mechanical properties of the thermoplastic foam core have been experimentally investigated and presented. This was followed by an experimental investigation and finite element modelling of the failure modes of the <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>composite</b> sandwich under static and dynamic localised indentation and bending loads. A fracture criteria was implemented in the model to simulate core shear fracture. The main contributions to knowledge from this doctoral study are: the static and dynamic characterisation of the mechanical properties and failure modes of the <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>composite</b> and the crushable thermoplastic foam material; development of a validated modelling methodology for predicting damage in thermoplastic composites; and development of a finite element modelling procedure for simulating the static and dynamic impact failure behaviour of <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>composite</b> sandwich structures.

The formability of the <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>composite</b> depends on the viscoelastic material behavior of the matrix material, which is sensitive to temperature and degree of crystallinity. An experimental study was performed to determine the effect of temperature and crystallinity on the storage modulus during cooling for a woven glass fiber polyamide- 6 composite material. An increase of two decades in modulus was observed during crystallization. As this will significantly impede the blank formability, the onset of crystallization effectively governs the time available for forming.
