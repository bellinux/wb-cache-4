The boys come from humble backgrounds and limited resources but what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> a zeal for the game of cricket and undeniable natural talent. They study in the local corporation school where the most important sport on agenda is wrestling…. Taught by Wrestling Guru Surinder Huda- a man driven by hatred for cricket because in his eyes it is cricket that is responsible for destroying traditional sports like Kushti, Kabbadi, and Hockey etc.|$|E

And another goal <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> to build capacity among local governments to understand, protect and restore their urban trees. Because {{there is a need for}} educating citizens about the maintenance of trees, Treevitalize provides nine hours of classroom and field training to community residents. [...] The classes cover a variety of topics such as tree identification, pruning, tree biology, and proper species selection.|$|E

2500|$|A {{distinguishing}} feature is how {{males and females}} process information and then recall what was presented to them. Females tend to remember nonverbal cues and associate {{the meaning of a}} discussion with gestures. Since males follow verbal cues they react more to the facts and actual words within a discussion to recall what was said, but fluctuations in the speaker's voice helps them maintain the memories. Another difference that sets males and females apart is recalling someone's voice. [...] They tend to recall information they have read, for instance, lists of objects are better recalled for men than women. The only similarity <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> that when emotional words are used or an emotional tone is produced, males and females tend to recall those changes.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Davidson {{entered a}} second {{performance}} {{with a similar}} topic, entitled Bad Knight II, which got {{the attention of the}} then Federal Minister for Education, Julie Bishop, who accused the teachers of having [...] "private political agendas" [...] and said that Davidson [...] "interestingly" [...] did the performance {{around the time of the}} Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, where U.S. President George Bush and other foreign leaders would be visiting. The performance was defended by the NSW Minister for Education and Training, John Della Bosca, who accused Bishop of using her supposed concern over the school's performance to criticise the public education system: [...] "I think it's another demonstration of how far out of touch Mrs Bishop and her colleagues in the Howard government are...the concern <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> just another (opportunity) to run down the achievements of young people in public education." ...|$|E
2500|$|Modred and the Druids {{perform a}} ritual which {{allows them to}} see into the future: the vision <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> evil. Évélina rushes in; she {{suspects}} that her father is in danger and she distrusts the two princes after she sees Irvin sighing frequently and looking troubled. Modred summons Arvire, Irvin and Vellinus. [...] He tells the princes one of them must swear an oath testifying their good faith on the sacred altar, and he chooses Irvin. Irvin is overcome with doubts about his mother's scheme. He has also {{fallen in love with}} Évélina. However, he is reluctant to betray his brother. The ceremony goes ahead, but Évélina interrupts it before Irvin can swear the oath. Modred suspects the truth and urges Irvin to confess everything to Évélina. Irvin and Évélina are left alone and Évélina gradually persuades the prince to admit the plot. Arvire enters with the news that Vellinus has fled to the Romans. A bard announces that the Roman army is invading Mona. At Évélina's prompting, Irvin offers to lead the British defence so Arvire can stay hidden. Arvire and Modred accept and Modred hands Irvin a sword and helmet. The British army marches off.|$|E

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, given {{a mother who}} is too {{generally}} hard or indifferent, then it rests with the father to provide the delicate sympathy and the refined discipline.

[...] "Nay," [...] but it {{is still}} answered, [...] "this is because we have not yet brought our {{knowledge}} into right use, but have been seeking to accumulate it, rather than to apply it wisely to the ends of art. Let us now do this, and we may achieve all that was done by that elder ignorant art, and infinitely more." [...] No, not so; for as soon as we try to put our knowledge to good use, we shall find that we have much more than we can use, and that what more we have is an encumbrance. All our errors in this respect arise from a gross misconception as to the true nature of knowledge itself. We talk of learned and ignorant men, as if there were a certain quantity of knowledge, which to possess was to be learned, and which not to possess was to be ignorant; instead of considering that knowledge is infinite, and that the man most learned in human estimation is just as far from knowing anything as he ought to know it, as the unlettered peasant. Men are merely on a lower or higher stage of an eminence, whose summit is God's throne, infinitely above all; and there is just as much reason for the wisest as for the simplest man being discontented with his position, as respects the real quantity of knowledge he possesses. And, for both of them, the only true reasons for contentment with the sum of knowledge they possess are these: that {{it is the kind of}} knowledge they need for their duty and happiness in life; that all <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> tested and certain, so far as it is in their power; that all <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> well in order, and within reach when they need it; that it has not cost too much time in the getting; that none of it, once got, has been lost; and that there is not too much to be easily taken care of.|$|E

We look towards the day, the day of the organized civilized world state. The first clear intimation of that conscious synthesis of human thought to which I look, the first edge of the dayspring, has arisen--as Socialism, as I conceive of Socialism. Socialism is to me no more and no less than the awakening of a collective consciousness in humanity, a collective will and a collective mind out of which finer individualities may arise forever in a perpetual series of fresh endeavours and fresh achievements for the race.|$|E
