40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a <b>travel</b> decision model using sociodemographics, <b>travel</b> characteristics, and psychographic factors and identify the different types of <b>travel</b> decision patterns in Japanese and West German <b>travel</b> markets. A secondary analysis of data from the Pleasure <b>Travel</b> Markets Survey for Japan and West Germany in 1989 was used. The major findings supported the proposition that models of a <b>travel</b> decision consisting of sociodemographics, <b>travel</b> characteristics and psychographics variables fit the observed data very well. Sociodemographics and <b>travel</b> characteristics were significantly related to psychographics variables and further predict the <b>travel</b> decision. The results also showed that <b>travel</b> decision pattern segmentation (<b>travel</b> philosophy [...] <b>travel</b> benefit sought [...] <b>travel</b> product preference) is a viable approach to identify different types of <b>travel</b> decision patterns in Japanese and West German <b>travel</b> markets. Implications of the findings are discussed and future research directions are suggested for this important area. ...|$|R

40|$|A longer, {{wider and}} more {{complicated}} {{change in the}} <b>travel</b> path is put forward {{to adapt to the}} rapidly increasing expansion of metropolises in the field of urban <b>travel.</b> Urban <b>travel</b> requires higher levels of sustainable urban transport. Therefore,this paper explores the circuity characteristics of urban <b>travel</b> and investigates the temporal relationship between time and <b>travel</b> circuity and the spatial relationship between distance and <b>travel</b> circuity to understand the efficiency of urban <b>travel.</b> Based on Guangzhou Taxi-GPS big data, <b>travel</b> circuity is considered in this paper to analyze the circuity spatial distribution and strength characteristics of urban <b>travel</b> in three types of metropolitan regions, including core areas, transition areas and fringe areas. Depending on the different attributes of the three types, the consistency and dissimilar characteristics of <b>travel</b> circuity and influencing factors of <b>travel</b> circuity in metropolises are discussed. The results are shown as follows: (1) by observing the temporal andspatial distribution of <b>travel</b> circuity, it can be found that peaks and troughs change with time, and <b>travel</b> circuity of transition areas is higher than other areas during the peak period. When <b>travelling</b> in these three regions, <b>travel</b> circuity spatial distribution is consistent, which is the core-periphery distribution. When <b>travelling</b> among these three regions, <b>travel</b> circuity spatial distribution is distinct; (2) by analyzing the relationship between time and distance of <b>travel</b> and <b>travel</b> circuity, {{it can be seen that}} the shorter the <b>travel</b> time or <b>travel</b> distance, the greater the <b>travel</b> circuity, resulting in a lower <b>travel</b> efficiency; (3) the influence of six factors, including population, road and public transportation, on <b>travel</b> circuity is significant.
