50|$|In an {{adaptive}} system, a parameter changes slowly {{and has no}} preferred value. In a self-adjusting system though, the parameter value “depends {{on the history of}} the system dynamics”. One of the most important qualities of self-adjusting systems is its “adaptation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> chaos” or ability to avoid chaos. Practically speaking, by heading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> chaos without going further, a leader may act spontaneously yet without disaster. A March/April 2009 Complexity article further explains the self-adjusting systems used and the realistic implications. Physicists have shown that adaptation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> chaos occurs in almost all systems with feedback.|$|R

Less than 10% of the light emitted from both the young and mature fruit bodies is from other tissues, including the fertile hymenial area and the stem. Fruit body luminescence is highly variable between fruit bodies found on different logs in different environments.|$|E

Scar taunts him over {{his role in}} Mufasa's death and backs him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rock, where he reveals to Simba that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar {{to the ground and}} forces him to reveal the truth {{to the rest of the}} pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, {{attempting}} to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame the hyenas for his actions; Simba spares his life but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to toss him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall but is killed by the hyenas, who overheard him betray them to Simba. With his enemies gone, Simba takes over the kingship as the rains begin to fall, restoring life to the land.|$|E
5|$|At 16:45, Tung {{was forced}} at gunpoint {{to talk to}} Diệm on the phone, telling the {{president}} that he had ordered his special forces to surrender. Minh then ordered Nhung to execute the Diệm loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy for Tung, because the special forces' commander had disguised his men in regular army uniforms and framed the generals for the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids in August. The generals {{were well aware of}} the threat that Tung posed; they had discussed his elimination during their planning, having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces. At nightfall, Nhung took Tung, and his brother and deputy, Major Lê Quang Triệu, with their hands tied, to a jeep and drove them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air base. Forced to kneel over two freshly dug holes, the brothers were shot into their graves and buried.|$|E

5|$|Class III {{dollars are}} {{identical}} to the Class II dollar, except lettering similar to that on the Class I dollars was applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coins. Based on the slightly concave appearance of the Class III dollars, {{it is likely that}} all were given edge lettering at some point after striking; as the Castaing machine was meant to be used prior to striking, its improper use resulted in a deformation of the coin surface. Newman and Bressett assert that they were struck at approximately {{the same time as the}} Class II dollars, and that the edges were lettered and the coins concealed by Mint employees until 1869, when one was offered to a coin collector, who rejected it as a restrike. However, numismatist S. Hudson Chapman believed that some Class III dollars were struck as late as 1876. In 1875, several were sold by Philadelphia coin dealer John W. Haseltine. Six specimens of the Class III dollar are known today.|$|E
5|$|Counterfeits and {{spurious}} {{reproductions of}} the 1804 dollar {{have been created}} since numismatists {{became aware of the}} coins' high value. James A. Bolen, a medallist and coin collector who created copies of valuable coins between 1862 and 1869, fabricated an 1804 dollar by altering the last digit in the date of a genuine 1803 example. Although Bolen added his name <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coin, other forgers created altered date coins with the intent to deceive. Nineteenth-century stage actor John T. Raymond purchased a specimen of the coin, which was later revealed to be a forgery, for $300. All silver dollars dated between 1800 and 1803 were subject to alteration to 1804 dollars, but 1801 was the date most commonly used for that purpose.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disadvantage}} in numbers {{as well as}} attacking a fixed position, Williams' and Macdonell's small force was driving the opposing force <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gorge on which the redan was situated, and seemed {{on the verge of}} success before the Americans were able to regroup and stand firm. The momentum of the battle turned when a musket ball hit Macdonell's mount (causing it to rear and twist around) and another shot hit him in the small of the back, causing him to fall from the horse. He was removed from the battlefield and died from his injuries early the next day. Captain Williams was laid low by a wound to the head, and Dennis by a severe wound to the thigh (although he continued to lead his detachment throughout the action). Carrying Macdonnell and the body of Brock, the British fell back through Queenston to Durham's Farm, a mile north near Vrooman's Point.|$|E
