5|$|Domesday {{makes it}} obvious that Urse {{was the most}} {{powerful}} layman in Worcester, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> could contest his power in the county was the Bishop of Worcester. The power struggle continued into the 12th century, as Urse's descendants still contested the bishops. Only one other layman is recorded as having a castle in Worcestershire in Domesday, and he held much less land than Urse.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, Wilder's agent {{sent him}} a script for a film called Super Chief. Wilder accepted, but told the film's {{producers}} that he thought <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> could keep the film from being offensive was Richard Pryor. Pryor accepted the role in the film, which had been renamed Silver Streak, the first film to team Wilder and Pryor. They became Hollywood's first successful interracial movie comedy duo.|$|E

Capps, who served as mayor in the late 1800s and early 1900s, is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> served two non-consecutive terms. From 1852 to 1888, the city was run by a Board of Trustees {{and there was no}} elected mayor. However, the president of the board was called mayor as a courtesy.|$|E

5|$|Believing that Gary, the Nosferatu chief, {{has stolen}} the sarcophagus, the fledgling {{is sent to}} Hollywood to find him; after {{locating}} a captured Nosferatu for Gary, he reveals that the sarcophagus was stolen by the Giovanni vampire clan. The fledgling infiltrates the Giovanni mansion and finds the sarcophagus guarded by the Kuei-Jin, who claim their leader, Ming-Xiao, has formed an alliance with LaCroix. The locked sarcophagus is returned to LaCroix's tower and Beckett, a vampire historian, tells the fledgling that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> can open it has been abducted by Grunfeld to lure LaCroix. The fledgling kills Grunfeld and learns that the sarcophagus' key has been stolen.|$|E
5|$|Ravel {{composed}} little during 1913. He {{collaborated with}} Stravinsky on a performing version of Mussorgsky's unfinished opera Khovanshchina, {{and his own}} works were the Trois poèmes de Mallarmé for soprano and chamber ensemble, and two short piano pieces, À la manière de Borodine and À la manière de Chabrier. In 1913, together with Debussy, Ravel was among the musicians present at the dress rehearsal of The Rite of Spring. Stravinsky later said that Ravel was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> immediately understood the music. Ravel predicted that the premiere of the Rite {{would be seen as}} an event of historic importance equal to that of Pelléas et Mélisande.|$|E

5|$|She {{was known}} for her honesty and {{moderate}} life style. Having received a small scholarship in 1893, she returned it in 1897 {{as soon as she}} began earning her keep. She gave much of her first Nobel Prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates. In an unusual decision, Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process, so that the scientific community could do research unhindered. She insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to the scientific institutions she was affiliated with rather than to her. She and her husband often refused awards and medals. Albert Einstein reportedly remarked that she was probably <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> could not be corrupted by fame.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder {{encounters}} a delusional man, Gary Lambert (Brian Markinson), who believes his boss, Greg Pincus (John Apicella), may be a monster—and decides to take an entire office building, including Mulder, hostage to prove it. Lambert is eventually killed, but somehow, Mulder inherits his ability to see Pincus as a monster. After Mulder claims that Pincus is a monster, he is locked in a psychiatric hospital, only to be saved by Scully: <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> believes him.|$|E
5|$|The {{term for}} the {{president}} is five years, but due to a 1996 referendum, the election {{that was supposed to}} occur in 1999 was pushed back to 2001. Under the 1994 constitution, the president could only serve for two terms as president, but due to a change in the constitution, term limits were eliminated. During the course of the office, elections were held in 1994, 2001, 2006, 2010 and on 11 October 2015. Alexander Lukashenko has been <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> has served as president since the elections in 1994.|$|E
60|$|Was {{the public}} estate a {{sufficient}} stake {{for the public}} debts? Assume that it was not, and that a loss must be incurred somewhere. When <b>the</b> <b>only</b> estate lawfully possessed, and which the contracting parties had in contemplation {{at the time in}} which their bargain was made, happens to fail, who, according to the principles of natural and legal equity, ought to be the sufferer? Certainly it ought to be either the party who trusted, or the party who persuaded him to trust, or both; and not third parties who had no concern with the transaction. Upon any insolvency, they ought to suffer who were weak enough to lend upon bad security, or they who fraudulently held out a security that was not valid. Laws are acquainted with no other rules of decision. But by the new institute of the rights of men, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> in equity ought to suffer are <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> are to be saved harmless: those are to answer the debt who neither were lenders nor borrowers, mortgagers nor mortgagees.|$|R

5|$|Years after Gwen Stacy's death, it is {{revealed}} that Osborn had {{a one-night stand}} with Gwen after she was overwhelmed by his charisma, which led to Gwen's pregnancy with her twin children Gabriel and Sarah. Osborn thus has three motives for killing Gwen; revenge against Spider-Man, to prevent Gwen talking of their affair and creating a scandal, and to take their children to raise by himself thus becoming his ideal heirs. Mary Jane Watson was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> knew of their liaison and their children's existence prior to Gwen's death and her eventual relationship with Peter, despising Osborn for his immoral behaviors long before through her later romance with Spider-Man discovering he is the villainous Green Goblin.|$|E
5|$|Characteristic of Marko was his reverence {{and love}} for his mother, Jevrosima; he often sought her advice, {{following}} it even when it contradicted his own desires. She lived with Marko at his mansion in Prilep, his lodestar guiding him away from evil and toward good {{on the path of}} moral improvement and Christian virtues. Marko's honesty and moral courage are noteworthy in a poem in which he was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> knew the will of the late Tsar Dušan regarding his heir. Marko refused to lie in favour of the pretenders—his father and uncles. He said truthfully that Dušan appointed his son, Uroš, heir to the Serbian throne. This almost cost him his life, since Vukašin tried to kill him.|$|E
5|$|Littlefinger {{arrives at}} Runestone in the Vale, with a pet falcon for his stepson, Lord of the Eyrie Robin Arryn. When Lord of Runestone Yohn Royce asks how Sansa became married to Ramsay Bolton instead {{of at the}} Fingers, Littlefinger claims Bolton's men {{attacked}} them and kidnapped her on the way. When Royce is dubious, Littlefinger adds that he was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> knew of their destination, implying his guilt. He manipulates Arryn into considering executing Royce, then into giving him a second chance after he pledges his absolute loyalty. Littlefinger then tells Arryn that Sansa, his cousin, has escaped the Boltons and is taking refuge at Castle Black, but that she is still not safe. Arryn agrees to command Royce to lead the knights of the Vale to protect her.|$|E

5|$|Neddermeyer {{discarded}} Serber and Tolman's initial {{concept of}} implosion as assembling {{a series of}} pieces in favor of one in which a hollow sphere was imploded by an explosive shell. He was assisted in this work by Hugh Bradner, Charles Critchfield, and John Streib. L. T. E. Thompson was brought in as a consultant, and discussed the problem with Neddermeyer in June 1943. Thompson was skeptical that an implosion could be made sufficiently symmetric. Oppenheimer arranged for Neddermeyer and Edwin McMillan to visit the National Defense Research Committee's Explosives Research Laboratory near the laboratories of the Bureau of Mines in Bruceton, Pennsylvania (a Pittsburgh suburb), where they spoke to George Kistiakowsky and his team. But Neddermeyer's efforts in July and August at imploding tubes to produce cylinders tended to produce objects that resembled rocks. Neddermeyer was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> believed that implosion was practical, and only his enthusiasm kept the project alive.|$|E
5|$|Stiefel showed Heidemann {{the diary}} in Stuttgart in January 1980, telling {{him it was}} from a plane crash in East Germany, {{although}} he refused to tell the journalist {{the name of his}} source. The collector spoke to Kujau to see if he would meet Heidemann, but the forger repeatedly refused Heidemann's requests for nearly a year. Heidemann returned to the Stern offices and spoke to his editor, but both Koch and Nannen refused to discuss the potential story with him, telling him to work on other features. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> was interested was Walde, who worked with Heidemann to find the source of the diaries. Their searches for Kujau proved fruitless, so they looked into the crash. Heidemann, who had read Baur's autobiography, knew of Gundlfinger's flight, and made a connection between Operation Seraglio and the diary; in November 1980 the two journalists travelled to Dresden and located the graves of the flight's crew.|$|E
5|$|Vijay is {{admitted}} to hospital, where Dr.Ashok Gilwani gives him scars identical to Don's. When Don suddenly dies, the masquerade begins. Vijay, as Don, joins the gang in Kuala Lumpur. DeSilva asks Vijay {{to find a}} computer disc containing details about the cartel {{and bring it to}} him. When Vijay finds it, Roma attempts to kill him, but DeSilva tells her about his plan, and she agrees to help him. Vijay hands over the disc to DeSilva. When DeSilva murders Singhania, the police arrive and arrest Vijay. DeSilva is killed in the shoot-out, which is unfortunate for Vijay because DeSilva was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> could prove that he is not the real Don. Having discovered his true identity, Don's associates turn against Vijay and the group engage in a fight. Vijay escapes and reconciles with Roma to recover the disc and prove his innocence.|$|E
