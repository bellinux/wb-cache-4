5|$|Most {{people on}} {{antipsychotics}} have side effects. People on typical antipsychotics {{tend to have}} a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects, while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with olanzapine, while risperidone and quetiapine are also associated with weight gain. Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol. It remains unclear whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome or <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesia,</b> a rare but serious neurological disorder.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive by people who have to take them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesia.</b> Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E
25|$|The {{side effects}} {{reportedly}} {{associated with the}} various atypical antipsychotics vary and are medication-specific. Generally speaking, atypical antipsychotics are widely believed to have a lower likelihood {{for the development of}} <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesia</b> than the typical antipsychotics. However, <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesia</b> typically develops after long-term (possibly decades) use of antipsychotics. It is not clear, then, if atypical antipsychotics, having been in use for a relatively short time, produce a lower incidence of <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Tardive</b> <b>dyskinesias</b> are {{involuntary}} {{movements of the}} lips, tongue, face, trunk, and extremities which occur in patients with prolonged exposure to dopamine antagonists or antipsychotic medications. Clinical findings have provided evidence that adenosine, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, {{plays a role in}} the development of tardive dykinesias. Tardive dykinesias have also been associated with polymorphism in the dopamine receptor D2 gene, dopamine receptor D3 gene, dopamine transporter (DAT) gene, and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) gene. <b>Tardive</b> <b>dyskinesias</b> are chronic compared to acute dystonia, which occur in an episodic fashion.|$|R
50|$|Biperiden, {{sold under}} the brandname Akineton among others, is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} Parkinson disease and certain drug-induced movement disorders. It is not recommended for <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesias.</b> It is taken by mouth, injection into a vein, or muscle.|$|R
40|$|OF all {{the side}} effects of drugs used to treat {{psychotic}} illness such as schizophrenia, chronic <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesias</b> are the most disturbing. They appear after months or years of therapy, and persist when the offending drug is withdrawn in about half of the cases. Such <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesias</b> resemble in character abnormal movements produced by levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease. They can be controlled by drugs that antagonise the cerebral actions of dopamine (DA) 1. Thus, they seem to be due to overstimulation of cerebral DA receptors, although they are caused by neuroleptic drugs which, in acute experiments, antagonise cerebral dopamine receptor action 2 – 5. This paradox has been resolved by suggesting that such drugs, by binding to and antagonising cerebral DA receptors, may eventually actually increase receptor sensitivity. Indeed, following treatment for a few weeks with phenothiazines or butyrophenones and withdrawal of the drugs, animals exhibit behavioural and biochemical supersensitivity to DA agonists which persists for some time 6 – 13. However, <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesias</b> usually appear while the patient continues to take the offending drug, so we have studied the effect on striatal DA receptor activity of continuous 6 -month administration to rats of a potent neuroleptic drug in common clinical use (trifluoperazine). At intervals the animals were tested for a behavioural response to the DA agonist apomorphine, and were killed for biochemical assessment of DA turnover and DA receptor activity {{in that part of the}} brain (the corpus striatum) believed to be the site responsible for production of <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesias.</b> We report here that the initial behavioural and biochemical evidence for striatal DA receptor blockade by trifluoperazine disappears within a few weeks of starting therapy, to be replaced by supersensitivity after 6 months of drug administration, despite continued drug intake...|$|R
25|$|All of the {{atypical}} antipsychotics warn {{about the}} possibility of <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesia</b> in their package inserts and in the PDR. It is not possible to truly know the risks of <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesia</b> when taking atypicals, because <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesia</b> can take many decades to develop and the atypical antipsychotics are not old enough to have been tested over a long enough period of time to determine all of the long-term risks. One hypothesis as to why atypicals have a lower risk of <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesia</b> is because they are much less fat-soluble than the typical antipsychotics and because they are readily released from D2 receptor and brain tissue. The typical antipsychotics remain attached to the D2 receptors and accumulate in the brain tissue which may lead to TD.|$|E

25|$|The mode {{of action}} of olanzapine's {{antipsychotic}} activity is unknown. It may involve antagonism of dopamine and serotonin receptors.

40|$|Maladaptive {{plasticity}} can {{be defined}} as behavioral loss or even development of disease symptoms resulting from aberrant plasticity changes in the human brain. Hyperkinetic movement disorders, either in the neurological or psychiatric realms, have been associated with maladaptive neural plasticity that can be expressed by functional changes such as an increase in transmitter release, receptor regulation and synaptic plasticity or anatomical modifications such as axonal regeneration, sprouting, synaptogenesis and neurogenesis. Recent evidence from human and animal models provided support to the hypothesis that these phenomena likely depend upon altered dopamine turnover induced by long-term drug treatment. However, it is still unclear how and where these altered mechanisms of cortical plasticity may be localized. The current article will provide an up-to-date overview of these issues together with some reflections on future studies in the field, particularly focusing on two specific disorders (levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson’s disease patients and <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesias</b> in schizophrenic patients) where the modern neuroimaging approaches have recently provided new fundamental insights...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY In a {{controlled}} trial, baclofen (mean dose 45 mg daily) significantly increased disability from Parkinsonism in 12 {{patients with the}} long-term levodopa syndrome. Peak dose choreoathetosis was not improved but benefit was observed in all four patients with "off period dystonia. " Adverse side effects were common and severe, and included visual hallucinations, vomiting, and dizziness. Baclofen (8 -parachlorophenyl gammabutyric acid) is an analogue of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) used {{in the treatment of}} spastic dis-orders. It has been shown in animal studies to affect central dopamine metabolism in a complex dose-dependent way (Fuxe et al., 1975), and to depress the firing rate of dopaminergic nigral neurones (Olpe et al., 1977). It is uncertain, how-ever, whether this effect is exerted through GABA synapses (Davies and Watkins, 1974; Anden and Wachtel, 1977), or occurs as a direct effect on dopamine receptors. On the assumption that baclofen is a GABA agonist, it has been used to treat the chorea of Huntington's disease (Barbeau, 1973), <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesias</b> (Korsgaard, 1976), and schizophrenia (Frederiksen, 1975; Bigelow et al., 1977), and has been shown to aggravate neuro...|$|R

The movements resembled <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesias</b> of older patients on neuroleptics, but neither patient had any exposure to neuroleptic drugs. Choreiform movements were moderately severe and remitted several hours after discontinuation of theophylline or over days in the patient who remained on the drug.

40|$|Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin protein {{produced}} by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Being {{one of the most}} poisonous naturally occurring substances and the most toxic protein, it {{has become one of the}} most widely used and most effective therapeutic agents ever invented. Botulinium toxin type A was first used in human strabismus in 1980. In less than three decades, its applications have expanded greatly. Nowadays it is used to treat all kinds of dystonic or non-dystonic muscle spasm, sphincter problems, headache, excessive sweating or salivation, spasticity of all sorts, and facial wrinkles. Dystonia has been the first movement disorder treated with botulinum toxin. However, the use of botulinum toxin has encompassed many other hyperkinetic movement disorders, such as tremor, tics, <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesias,</b> and bruxism. This tremendous explosion in the use of botulinum toxin is attributed to its effectiveness and relative lack of severe side-effects.

On drug withdrawal, spontaneous locomotor acitivity was enhenced after 2 weeks and the enhanced stereotyped response was maintained {{for up to}} 1 month. Spontaneous mouthing had disappeared 2 weeks after drug withdrawal. The increase in Bmax for 3 H-spiperone binding was maintained for up to 3 months after drug removal, but KD reverted to control levels by 2 weeks. In contrast, the dopamine stimulation of striatal adenylated cyclase remained enhanced for the 6 month withdrawal period. Administration of trifluoperazine (0. 7 – 0. 9 mg/kg/day) or thioridazine (6 – 8 mg/kg/day) for 12 months produced a less marked effect than {{administration of}} the higher dose. No enhancement of effect was observed on drug withdrawal and the initial changes disappeared rapidly on removal of drug.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{effect of}} sodium valproate 1200 mg daily on the {{disability}} of Parkinsonism and on levodopa-induced dyskinesias was assessed in a double-blind crossover trial with matched placebo in 12 patients with Parkinson's disease. No objective {{change in the}} severity of Parkinsonism or dyskinesias was noted. However, six out of nine patients who completed the trial noted a slight to moderate improvement in their dyskinesias with no change in their Parkinsonism. Excess salivation improved in four subjects on sodium valproate. The amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is widespread throughout the nervous system where it generally functions as an in-hibitory neurotransmitter (Roberts, 1974). The importance of GABA in the motor system of man is not known, although the highest concentration of GABA in animals and man {{is found in the}} basal ganglia (Bird, 1976). The concentration of GABA and its synthesising enzyme 1 -glutamic acid decarboxylase is reduced by half in patients dying of Parkinson's disease (McGeer et al., 1973). In mammals, there is a GABAminergic path-way descending from the neostriatum to the sub-stantia nigra (Kim et al., 1971) which mediates an inhibitory effect on ascending nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways (Tarsy et al., 1975). Thus, manipulation of GABA levels in the basal ganglia might be useful for the treatment of Parkinson's disease or affect the side effects of antiparkinsonism medication. Linnoila et al. (1976) have reported that sodium valproate (Epilim, Reckitt-Labaz), which raises brain GABA levels, improves the features of chronic <b>tardive</b> <b>dyskinesias.</b> We have investigated the action of sodium valproate in people with Parkinson's disease to determine whether this drug alters any aspect of disability in this disorder as well as to determine the action on levodopa-induced dyskinesias...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{several aspects of}} {{movement}} disorders in patients with schizophrenia and in their unaffected siblings. The main hypothesis is that movement disorders are not just side effects of antipsychotic medication but may also be symptoms of the illness itself and {{are related to the}} (genetic) risk of developing the disease. To address these questions a systematic literature search was followed by a clinical prevalence and association study of movement disorders with schizotypy in siblings of patients with schizophrenia, and a candidate gene study of movement disorders in patients using antipsychotic medication. Further, we developped a mechanical instrument and examined whether mechanical measurement of lingual force variability reflects <b>tardive</b> tongue <b>dyskinesia</b> and whether mechanical measurement of movement disorders in siblings of patients with schizophrenia is more sensitive than clinical rating scales. The results of this thesis suggest that movement disorders are associated to antipsychotic naïve patients with schizophrenia and are also more prevalent in their unaffected siblings compared to controls. This could imply that movement disorders represent symptoms of schizophrenia and may be markers of vulnerability of developing the disease. In addition the results of this thesis indicate that in siblings of patients with schizophrenia, mechanical instruments may also be more sensitive for detecting subclinical movement disorders than traditional clinician-based rating scales...|$|R
