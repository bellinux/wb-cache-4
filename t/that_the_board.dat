5|$|In 1943, Hogg {{decided to}} run for a seat on the Houston School Board so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> would include two female members. Hogg won with 4,350votes, more than 1,000 ahead of the runner-up. During her term, she worked to remove gender and race as {{criteria}} for determining pay. She championed a visiting teacher program for children with emotional problems and began art education programs in the schools for black students. Hogg declined to run for a second term.|$|E
25|$|The Court's ruling {{concluded}} with a lengthy discussion {{of the nature of}} <b>the</b> <b>Board's</b> order. <b>The</b> employer had claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Board's</b> order was arbitrary and capricious. Justice Roberts reviewed at length <b>the</b> <b>Board's</b> evidentiary hearings, <b>the</b> language of the order, {{and the nature of the}} charges against Mackay Radio. Mackay Radio's claim, Roberts said, largely turned on whether <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> had failed to define a current labor dispute. But having already dismissed that argument earlier, Roberts concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Board's</b> order was appropriate.|$|R

50|$|In 2010 the Federal Trade Commission filed a {{complaint}} alleging <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Board's</b> actions were anti-competitive and unlawful under the Federal Trade Commission Act. An administrative law judge refused to dismiss the complaint on <b>the</b> <b>Board's</b> claim <b>that</b> they had state-action immunity and later ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Board's</b> concerted action constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade and a method of unfair competition, falling afoul of antitrust law. The ruling was sustained by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari. Oral arguments were held on October 14, 2014.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Metropolitan Board of Works, which had taken over toll bridges in west London and opened them to free public use, it was suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> should fund a free crossing of the Thames in east London. Proposals were made to provide services at Woolwich and further upstream at Greenwich, but the latter plan was abandoned. In 1884 the Board agreed to provide two steam-powered ferries, each costing £10,650, and asked chief engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette to lead design and construction. In September 1887 Messrs Mowlem and company were awarded contracts valued at £54,900 to build approaches, bridges and pontoons.|$|E
5|$|However, in 1951–52, Barnes made {{a return}} to cricket, and sought {{selection}} in the national team to play the West Indies during the 1951–52 Australian season. Australia {{had been unable to}} find a reliable opener to accompany Barnes's former partner Arthur Morris. Australia's batsmen struggled in the first two Tests, and before the Third Test, Barnes scored 107 against Victoria, putting on 210 in partnership with Morris for New South Wales. The Sporting Globe in Melbourne had presciently predicted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> would object if the selectors chose Barnes.|$|E

5|$|The case of Ellis v. Dubowski (1921) {{lays down}} the {{principle}} {{that there can be}} no delegation of authority to an absolute body from which no right of appeal exists. In this case, a licensing committee exercising statutory powers to license cinemas to be used for film screenings had imposed a condition in a licence that films had to be certified by the British Board of Film Censors before they could be shown. This was found to be ultra vires because the Board should not be made the final dictator. Furthermore, the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> had been given absolute power to prohibit films for reasons which might be private or influenced by trade considerations was sufficient to render the condition ultra vires.|$|E
5|$|The {{governance}} {{of the university}} is conducted through the Board of Governors and the Senate, {{both of which were}} established in the Act to unite Toronto Baptist College and Woodstock College in 1887. The Board is responsible for the university's conduct, management, and control of the university and of its property, revenues, business, and affairs. Ex officio governors of the Board include the university's chancellor, president, {{and the chairman of the}} board-senate committee on long-range planning. The Board also consists of 34 other governors, either appointed or elected by the various members of the university's community, including elected representatives from the student body. While The McMaster University Act, 1976 outlines <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> be only composed of 37 members, the Board also includes 12 honorary members, bringing the total number of governors to 51.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{function}} delegated by a public authority is crucial in determining whether such delegation offends the law. Where functions are considered administrative, delegation may not be wrongful. In R. v. Race Relations Board, ex parte Selvarajan (1975), it was accepted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> could establish a committee in order to investigate and conduct preliminary inquiries, {{and that it was}} not practical for the whole body to be engaged in such a task. On the other hand, it is an established principle that no tribunal can delegate judicial or quasi-judicial functions such as disciplinary powers.|$|E

After only one month as a manager, he was fired after a 2–0 loss to rivals Al Ahly in Cairo derby, leading {{to increase the gap}} between the two teams to seven points. Later Mortada Mansour said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> decided to remove Mido from his position after the loss to Ismaily, but announcing it was delayed until Cairo Derby is played, to avoid distraction of players.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Sheppard was {{recommended}} to Tuscaloosa Theological Institute (now Stillman College, which dedicated its library in Sheppard's honor in 1959) in Alabama. He met Lucy Gantt {{near the end}} of his time there and the two became engaged, although they would not marry for ten years. Sheppard cultivated a desire to preach in Africa, but despite the support of Tuscaloosa founder Charles Stillman, the Southern Presbyterian Church had yet to establish its mission in the Congo. He was ordained in 1888 and served as pastor to a church in Atlanta, Georgia, but did not adapt well to the life of an urban black in a heavily segregated area of the Southern United States. After two years of writing to the Presbyterian Foreign Missionary Board in Baltimore, Maryland to inquire about starting a mission in Africa, he became frustrated by the vague rationale of the rejection letters and took a train to Baltimore to ask the chairman in person. The man politely informed Sheppard <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> would not send a black man without a white supervisor.|$|E
5|$|As a {{cost-saving}} move, {{effective on}} July 1, 1934, the Georgia Board of Regents transferred {{control of the}} relatively large Evening School of Commerce to the University of Georgia and moved the small civil engineering program at UGA to Tech. The move was controversial, and both students and faculty protested against it, fearing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> of Regents would remove other programs from Georgia Tech and reduce it to an engineering department of the University of Georgia. Brittain suggested {{that the lack of}} Georgia Tech alumni on the Board of Regents contributed to their decision. Despite the pressure, the Board of Regents held its ground. The Depression also {{had a significant impact on}} the athletic program, as most athletes were in the commerce school, and resulted in the elimination of athletic scholarships, which were replaced by a loan program. Plans for an industrial management department to replace and supersede the Evening School of Commerce were first made in fall 1934. The department was established in 1935, and evolved into Tech's College of Management.|$|E

5|$|England toured Australia in the 1954–55 season. Johnson was {{selected}} to lead an Australian XI in a tour match against the Englishmen before the Tests, {{an indication of the}} selectors' inclination. He took 6/66 in England's only innings. The build-up featured a media war, with Melbourne newspapers stumping for Johnson while the Sydney journalists trumpeted Miller. Miller warmed up for the Tests with 86 for New South Wales against England. On 18 November, the Australian Board of Control selected Johnson as captain, with Morris as his deputy. Miller's irreverent nature was cited as a possible reason for the board's selection. Johnson was regarded as a superior diplomat, while Miller had a reputation for turning up late and being undisciplined. Miller had frequently been in dispute with Bradman, {{who was a member of}} the board and the chairman of selectors. Miller had also questioned where revenue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> collected from ticket sales was being used. Others claimed that Johnson was appointed because he was part of the establishment; his father Bill was a former Australian selector. The decision was bitterly criticised by the Sydney press.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the newspaper Fremover (Narvik, Norway), in May 1994, the English aviation engineer Hugh Tyrer stated that the cause of the accident was probably due to fatigue in the end piece of the transfer mechanism to the elevator. The end piece was in such a state that it would have failed sooner or later in ordinary use. Following this discovery in the wreck, Widerøe had grounded all their Twin Otters and checked these pieces, but without finding any other defect parts. de Havilland Canada had also sent an alert to all operators of the Twin Otter to check the component, and had canceled the contract with the subcontractor. On 800 operating Twin Otters, 86 end pieces were replaced shortly after the accident, although none had fatigue similar to that of LN-BNS. The commission's chair, Ragnar Rygnestad, stated that they had not considered the end piece {{to be part of the}} cause of the accident, and that they therefore had not stress-tested it or the elevator to see what forces were needed to cause a crack. Rygnestad stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> knew about the fatigue. He also said that he had no problems with the opening of a new inquiry. Widerøe stated that they trusted the report from the Accident Investigation Board.|$|E

2500|$|On March 13, 1906, The New York Times editorialized {{in support}} of <b>the</b> Simplified Spelling <b>Board's</b> efforts, noting that 90% of English words are [...] "fairly well spelled", but that [...] "a vast {{improvement}} could be effected by reducing {{to some sort of}} regularity <b>the</b> much-used tenth <b>that</b> makes most of the trouble". An editorial in the following day's edition noted <b>that</b> opponents of <b>the</b> <b>board's</b> efforts had suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> language be kept as is, only taught better, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> members of <b>the</b> <b>board</b> would respect <b>the</b> language's history in its improvement efforts without hiding or distorting it. Brander Matthews, <b>the</b> <b>board's</b> chairman, emphasized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>board's</b> primary mission in simplifying the language was to eliminate unneeded letters, noting that [...] "implification by omission – this is its platform; this is its motto". Isaac Funk wrote to The Times on March 20, 1906, emphasizing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>board's</b> first aim was [...] "a conservatively progressive evolution, aiming chiefly at the dropping of silent letters", accelerating a process that {{had been going on for}} centuries. This would be followed by the use of a phonetic alphabet developed by the American Philological Association and including the 40 basic sounds used in English. Phonetics would be taught to children in nursery school or kindergarten.|$|R
