5|$|Lure {{coursing}} is a {{sport for}} dogs based on hare coursing, but involving dogs chasing a mechanically operated lure. Some critics of hare coursing suggest that coursers could test <b>their</b> <b>dogs</b> through lure coursing. However, coursers believe that, while lure coursing is good athletic exercise for <b>their</b> <b>dogs,</b> {{it does not}} approximate the testing vigour and sport of live coursing.|$|E
5|$|Pranarodha (obstruction to life): Some Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas (merchant caste) {{indulge in}} the sport of hunting with <b>their</b> <b>dogs</b> and donkeys in the forest, {{resulting}} in wanton killing of animals. Yamadutas play archery sport with them as the targets in this hell.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the numbers}} of dogs killed each year are {{relatively}} low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs. In many cultures, there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and <b>their</b> <b>dogs</b> {{that can be seen}} as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} 22 dogs with {{separation}} anxiety related behavior (SRB) and 7 dogs without SRB were participating with their owners {{in a clinical}} trial to observe the owner-dog interaction. The behavior of the owner {{is thought to be}} an underlying cause of separation anxiety in dogs The behaviors of the owner and dogs were recorded during three phases: the table phase, separation phase and reunion phase. Owners filled in a questionnaire about the prevalence of SRB symptoms and a questionnaire about the ‘quality of life’ of <b>their</b> <b>dog.</b> This study’s focus is on the behavior of the owner during the reunion phase. Results show that SRB owners touched <b>their</b> <b>dog</b> more, showed more control talk, looked more to <b>their</b> <b>dog</b> and sit more facing <b>their</b> <b>dog</b> than non-SRB owners did. Female owners petted <b>their</b> <b>dog</b> more and showed more control talk and general talk to <b>their</b> <b>dog</b> in comparison with male owners. A significant positive correlation was found between control talk and non-verbal control of the owner, between control talk and total talking to the dog, between comfort talk and total talking to the dog and comfort talk and the sum of all physical interactions...|$|R

5|$|Among {{the most}} popular {{activities}} for an Australian Cattle Dog is dog agility. It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler's body language and willing to work accurately {{at a distance from}} the handler. Agility has been used by Cattle Dog owners to instil confidence in <b>their</b> <b>dogs,</b> and enhance their performance in training and competition.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century the area around the mouth of the River Somme was {{considered}} a paradise for hunters interested in wildfowl. Because of quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom, British shooters would board <b>their</b> <b>dogs</b> in the Picardy area, near the mouth of the Somme. This caused the infusion of English Setter blood into the local Spaniel population and developed the Blue Picardy Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of the {{harassment}} of coyotes practiced by rural people, urban coyotes are losing their fear of humans, which is further worsened by people intentionally or unintentionally feeding coyotes. In such situations, some coyotes have begun to act aggressively toward humans, chasing joggers and bicyclists, confronting people walking <b>their</b> <b>dogs,</b> and stalking small children. Non-rabid coyotes in these areas sometimes target small children, mostly under the age of 10, though some adults have been bitten.|$|E

5|$|The {{golden jackal}} may have once been tamed in Neolithic Turkey 11,000 years ago, {{as there is}} a {{sculpture}} of a man cradling a jackal found in Göbekli Tepe. French explorers during the 19thcentury noted that people in the Levant kept golden jackals in their homes. The Kalmyk people near the Caspian Sea were known to frequently cross <b>their</b> <b>dogs</b> with jackals, and Balkan shepherds once crossed their sheepdogs with jackals.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of the breed in Russia increased after the early 1990s, with Moscow dog shows since that time annually including between 120 and 131 Russian Spaniels, which qualifies the breed {{as one of the}} most popular, along with the Irish Setter. In 2002, the Russian Spaniel Club was set up in the United States to increase the knowledge of the breed outside Russia and to enable owners to register <b>their</b> <b>dogs.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the park}} is a {{national}} nature reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest, all dog owners are required to keep <b>their</b> <b>dogs</b> under control while in the park. This includes not allowing their dog to disturb other park users or disrupt wildlife. In 2009, after some incidents leading {{to the death of}} wildfowl, the park's dogs-on-leads policy was extended. Park users are said to believe that the deer are feeling increasingly threatened by the growing number of dogs using the park and Royal Parks advises against walking dogs in the park during the deer's birthing season.|$|E

5|$|Grave {{artifacts}} from dirt domes excavated in the 1980s along the Illinois River revealed a complete {{skeleton of a}} young bobcat along with a collar made of bone pendants and shell beads that had been buried by the Hopewell culture. The type and place of burial indicate a tamed and cherished pet or possible spiritual significance. The Hopewell normally buried <b>their</b> <b>dogs,</b> so the bones were initially identified as remains of a puppy, but dogs were usually buried close to the village {{and not in the}} mounts themselves. This is the only wild cat decorated burial on the archaeological record.|$|E
5|$|Lassie themes {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} boys and <b>their</b> <b>dogs</b> with the show helping to shape the viewer's understanding of mid-twentieth century American boyhood. Lassie {{was associated with the}} wholesome family values of its period but some parents' groups monitoring television content found cliffhanger plots showing children in danger too intense for very young viewers and objected to some of Timmy's actions which were believed to encourage children to disobey parents. However, Lassie was consistently depicted as caring, nurturing, and responsible with a commitment to family and community, often rescuing those in peril and righting wrongs. She was the perfect 'mother' within the American ideology of the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The breed gained {{official}} {{recognition from}} the Canadian Kennel Club in January 1980 {{after five years}} of collecting pedigrees, gathering support, and lobbying officials by two breeders and enthusiasts. The small number of Australian Cattle Dogs in Canada at the time were primarily working dogs on farms and ranches scattered across large distances. However, the fledgling breed club held conformation shows, obedience and agility competitions, and entered <b>their</b> <b>dogs</b> in sports including flyball and lure coursing. At the end of 1980, Landmaster Carina was named the first Australian Cattle Dog in Canada to gain both her conformation and obedience titles.|$|E

5|$|Two Rivers is {{the final}} {{checkpoint}} in the Whitehorse–Fairbanks route. Mushers are required to rest at least eight hours in Two Rivers in odd years to ensure the health of <b>their</b> <b>dogs</b> during the final leg of the race. The terrain in this stretch is among the easiest on the trail, with gently rolling hills and forest which gradually change into an urban landscape as racers approach Fairbanks. The greatest challenge for racers in the Two Rivers area is distinguishing the Yukon Quest trail from other sled dog trails, {{many of which have}} similar markings. Mushers have occasionally been deceived by these markings and taken wrong turns.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1840s, European {{settlers}} cleared vast {{tracts of}} land for farming and grazing, further reducing kakapo habitat. They brought more dogs and other mammalian predators, including domestic cats, black rats and stoats. Europeans knew little of the kakapo until George Gray of the British Museum described it from a skin in 1845. As the Māori had done, early European explorers and <b>their</b> <b>dogs</b> ate kakapo. In the late 19th century, the kakapo became well known as a scientific curiosity, and thousands were captured or killed for zoos, museums and collectors. Most captured specimens died within months. From at least the 1870s, collectors knew the kakapo population was declining; their prime concern was to collect {{as many as possible}} before the bird became extinct.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} other animals can be transmitted by ticks, the species of tick involved tending to be those with a wide host range. Spread of disease {{in this way is}} enhanced by the extended time during which a tick remains attached, during which time the mobile host can be carried long distances, {{or in the case of}} bird hosts, across the sea. The infective agents can be present not only in the adult tick but also in the eggs produced plentifully by the females. Many tick species have extended their ranges as a result of the movements of people, their pets and livestock. With increasing participation in outdoor activities such as wilderness hikes, more people and <b>their</b> <b>dogs</b> may find themselves exposed to attack.|$|E

5|$|The Stanley Cup {{championship}} team is allotted 100 days during off-season to pass around the Cup including the team's parade, days with sponsors {{and a day}} or so with each player and member of the team's staff. It is always accompanied by at least one representative from the Hockey Hall of Fame. Although many players have unofficially spent a day in personal possession of the Cup, in 1994 the New York Rangers started a tradition wherein each member of the Cup-winning team is allowed to retain the Cup for a day. Victors of the Cup have used it to baptize their children. Three players (the New York Islanders' Clark Gillies, the Anaheim Ducks' Sean O'Donnell, and the Pittsburgh Penguins' Nick Bonino) even allowed <b>their</b> <b>dogs</b> to eat out of the Cup.|$|E
5|$|While ashore {{during the}} peace Macnamara {{contrived}} to become {{embroiled in a}} duel. While walking his Newfoundland dog in Hyde Park on 6 April 1803 he had an altercation with Colonel Robert Montgomery, when <b>their</b> <b>dogs</b> began fighting. Harsh words were exchanged, and the two parties fought a duel that evening at Chalk Farm. Both men were wounded, the colonel mortally. Macnamara was arrested {{on a charge of}} manslaughter and put on trial at the Old Bailey on 22 April. Macnamara defended himself from the charge on the grounds that he had received an affront and that it was necessary for him to challenge it in order to maintain his position as a naval officer. He summoned many of his naval friends, among whom Viscounts Hood and Nelson, Lord Hotham, Sir Hyde Parker, Sir Thomas Troubridge, Captains Martin, Towry, Lydiard, Moore and Waller; and General Churchill and Lord Minto, to testify in his defence. They supported his assertion that he was the 'reverse of quarrelsome' and the jury took ten minutes to acquit him.|$|E
5|$|During her pre-war New York – Antwerp sailings, Kroonland carried {{some notable}} and {{interesting}} passengers. On 1 August 1904, {{one of the}} ship's passengers arrived in New York as somewhat of a mystery woman. She recounted that she had gone out for dinner in Antwerp and awakened to find herself at sea with only the white silk evening gown she was wearing. Having no money or luggage, she was barred from entering the United States and was compelled to remain on board the ship. After her predicament was reported in The New York Times, she received letters and telegrams that included marriage proposals. Her background story and a letter of credit eventually verified her identity, but she was deported after a New York doctor pronounced her insane. Later the same month The New York Times reported on first-class passengers' complaints over privileges for <b>their</b> <b>dogs</b> and the conditions in the kennel aboard the liner. One passenger was determined to have her dog in her state room, and after others joined her in removing canine companions from the kennel, Kroonlands crew took all the dogs back to the kennel. Many of the dog owners refused {{to speak to the}} others involved {{for the duration of the}} voyage.|$|E
