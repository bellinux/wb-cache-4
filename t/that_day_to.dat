Eight, thirty and twenty fullsibs progenies in three different maize varieties was laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with replicate thrice in three rows of three meter length. Analysis of variance showed that Azam was highly significant for <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis, <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking and grain yield. Similarly, Pahari and Iqbal showed highly significant difference for <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis, <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking, <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity and grain yield.

Correlation of Azam showed <b>that</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis; <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking observed highly significant while <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with anthesis to silking interval (ASI) observed significant difference. Correlations of Pahari showed <b>that</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis; <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking; grain yield with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity observed highly significant but grain yield with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking observed significant difference. Correlation analysis of Iqbal showed <b>that</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis; <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking showed highly significant while anthesis to silking interval (ASI) with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with anthesis to silking interval (ASI) observed significant difference.

That night, {{the men of the}} 6th Massachusetts barracked in Faneuil and Boylston Halls. The next morning, April 17, three companies previously belonging to other Massachusetts militia units (one from Boston, one from Stoneham, and another from Worcester) were added to the 6th Massachusetts to form a regiment of 11 companies total.

5|$|Over {{the course}} of 911 September, the British {{launched}} several air strikes on Messina, and Gorizia contributed her anti-aircraft batteries {{to the defense of}} the port. Later in the month, the British sent another convoy to reinforce Malta codenamed Operation Halberd; the Italian fleet sortied on 26 September to try to intercept it, but broke off the operation upon discovering the strength of the British escort force. On 29 September, upon returning from the failed attempt to disrupt Operation Halberd, Gorizia was sent to operate from La Maddalena, though she returned to Messina on 10 October. An Allied air attack on the port on 21 November caused extensive damage to Gorizias superstructure from bomb splinters, though she nevertheless sortied <b>that</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> escort another convoy to North Africa.

This decision, which had been endorsed by RAAF Command, took No. 10 Group's headquarters and personnel by surprise and led to the cancellation of a raid on Rempi planned for <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> <b>To</b> keep No. 10 Group up to strength, three light bomber squadrons were transferred from No. 9 Group to No. 77 Wing. During a subsequent discussion between Kenney and Air Vice-Marshal George Jones, the Chief of the Air Force, the American general stated that he did not intend to use the Vengeance in combat again.
