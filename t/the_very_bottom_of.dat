Therefore, it gets most of the food and naturally, yields the biggest female – the queen.|$|E
25|$|The {{wreck of}} Britannic was {{discovered}} in 1975 by Jacques-Yves Cousteau. It has a large tear in the front caused by the bow hitting the ocean floor {{before the rest of}} the ship sank (the ship's length is greater than the shallowness of the water). She has been, after the discovery, regularly seen as part of many other expeditions. In contrast to Titanic, which lies at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the North Atlantic and is being fed on by iron-eating bacteria, the Britannic is in remarkably good condition, and is much more accessible than her infamous sister. Many external structural features are still intact, including her propellers, {{and a great deal of}} her superstructure and hull.|$|E
40|$|A {{mechanism}} of the condensation of e-h pairs in bulk GaAs at room temperature, which has been observed earlier, is proposed. The {{point is that the}} photon assisted pairing happens in a system of electrons and holes that occupy energy levels at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bands. Due to a very high e-h density, the destruction of the pairs and loss of coherency does not occur because almost all energy levels inside a 30 - 60 meV band from the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the conduction band prove to be occupied. As a result, a coherent ensemble of composite bosons (paired electrons and holes) with the minimum possible energy appears. The lifetime of this strongly non-equilibrium coherent e-h BCS-like state is as short as a few hundred of femtosecondsComment: 10 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

25|$|Surrey Lions {{recorded}} {{their second}} win from two matches in Twenty20 Cup cricket this season, ironic given their position at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the 45-over National League. Ali Brown made 64 and David Thornely 67 not out as Middlesex Crusaders conceded too many runs at the fine batting track at Lord's, Surrey making 200 for 3. Owais Shah notched up his second {{score in the}} 70s in two days, taking 78 from 44 balls, and things looked good despite Shah leaving at 148 for 2. But Tim Murtagh changed all that. In four overs, he took six for 24, {{and with the help}} of David Thornely (three for 22) he ensured that Middlesex had seven batsmen out in single figures. They were bowled out for 177, with three balls remaining in the innings.|$|E
25|$|Pulis {{then joined}} Gillingham {{in the summer}} of 1995, whom he managed for a further four seasons, turning a team that had {{struggled}} at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the Football League into a promotion winning one in his first season, and laying the foundations for the club's eventual elevation to the First Division {{for the first time in}} their history. In the 1999 Second Division play-off final, the Gills were 2–0 up with less than two minutes left, following goals by the prolific partnership of Robert Taylor and Carl Asaba, only to see Manchester City score twice, the equaliser in injury time, and after that win a penalty shoot-out 3–1. Following the defeat, Pulis was controversially sacked by the club amidst claims of gross misconduct. He later brought a £400,000 court case against Gillingham chairman Paul Scally for unpaid bonuses, which was settled out of court in 2001 for £75,000.|$|E

However, the stacked turtles are in pain and Mack, the turtle at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the pile, is suffering the most. Mack asks Yertle for a respite, but Yertle just tells him to be quiet. Then Yertle decides to expand his kingdom and commands more and more turtles to add to his throne. Mack makes a second request for a respite because the increased weight is now causing extreme pain to the turtles {{at the bottom of the}} pile, as well as hunger. Again, Yertle yells at Mack to be quiet. Then Yertle notices the moon rising above him as the night approaches. Furious that something [...] "dares to be higher than Yertle the King", he decides to call for even more turtles in an attempt to rise above it. However, before he can give the command, Mack decides he has had enough. He burps, which takes away Yertle's throne and tosses the turtle king off the turtle stack and into the water, leaving him [...] "King of the Mud" [...] and freeing the others.|$|E
500|$|The cap of A.atkinsoniana is [...] wide, and {{depending}} on its age, ranges in shape from convex to flattened, sometimes with a shallow central depression. Its color can vary from whitish to yellowish-white, brownish-gray, brownish-orange to grayish-brown, and is lighter on the margin. The cap surface is covered with {{the remnants of the}} universal veil as small reddish-brown to grayish-brown, easily removable, conical warts. Approaching the edge of the cap, the warts gradually become small, woolly patches. The cap margin is smooth or has faint grooves mirroring the underlying gills, and has partial veil remnants hanging along the edge. The gills are free from attachment to the stem, close to crowded together, moderately broad, yellowish-white, and occasionally have a slight reddish stain. The lamellulae (short gills that do not extend completely from the cap margin to the stem) are truncate (cut off sharply) to attenuate. The stem is [...] long and [...] wide, equal or tapering slightly toward apex, whitish, and [...] to smooth. The basal bulb is club-shaped, - or turnip-shaped, rounded or pointed, usually covered with rings of reddish-brown scales or warts of universal veil remains, often extending up the stem for a short distance. The universal veil on the stem base is quite unusual in Amanita, because it forms warts that extend nearly to <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the bulb. The stem often roots into the soil beneath the bulb with an elongated cord of mycelium known as a pseudorhiza. The partial veil forms an ring that is somewhat membranous, fragile to moderately persistent, and yellowish-white to pale yellow. Eventually, as the mushroom matures, it collapses on the stem as a thin membrane. The flesh is white, with a weak odor of bleaching powder.|$|E

25|$|Metal halide {{lights are}} {{generally}} the highest output lighting commercially available. They produce about 90-100 {{lumens per watt}} of power. This is roughly the same as fluorescent. The improvement with metal halides is that they concentrate this light output into a very small space, whereas fluorescent lights evenly illuminate the entire aquarium. This {{is often referred to}} as point source lighting, and is what causes the rippling visual effect on many advanced aquarium setups. This concentration of light output increases the intensity, allowing metal halide lamps to penetrate light to even <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>bottom</b> levels <b>of</b> most aquariums. Metal halides are available in many color temperatures, from 6500 K up to 20,000 K, though bulbs as high as 50,000 K are occasionally found. The downsides of metal halide lighting are the initial cost and the heat produced.|$|R

With few absorbers in the reactor core, such as during the Chernobyl accident, the positive void coefficient of the reactor makes <b>the</b> reactor <b>very</b> sensitive to <b>the</b> feedwater temperature.
