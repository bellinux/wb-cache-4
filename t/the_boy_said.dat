25|$|Grey {{described}} his men killing 40 or 50 French soldiers {{and others who}} came out of the town to gather cockles and periwinkles on 13 May. The French journalist wrote of the same event, relating that some of the hungry townspeople went out to collect shell-fish and were attacked by the English. A little French boy taken on the shore was brought to Grey of Wilton. When asked if they had enough food for a fortnight, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>said</b> he had heard the captains say the English would not take the town by famine or force for four or five months yet. Raphael Holinshed puts this event on 4 July, saying that Grey first issued a warning to d'Oysel about the cockle-pickers.|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{attempted}} suicide {{several times and}} for years afterwards bore scars where {{he had tried to}} slit his wrists. According to Nosanchuk, by early March 1966 the prisoner's behaviour [...] "bordered on psychotic". During this month he threw food at an officer and was once again found with a broomstick in his rectum, this time dragging it around the floor of his cell and laughing. When Scott sedated Lamb and questioned him on the latter incident, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>said</b> he had just been trying to annoy the guard on duty. Scott once again noted his concern that Lamb was developing a hypomanic condition, a mania of low intensity, and on 18 March committed him to Kingston Psychiatric Hospital for a month. Scott wrote in his report to the hospital that he was not sure whether Lamb's condition was genuine or whether he was just putting on an act.|$|E

500|$|The 1926 World Series {{produced}} one of {{the most}} famous anecdotes in baseball history, involving Babe Ruth and Johnny Sylvester. Sylvester was an 11-year-old boy from Essex Fells, New Jersey who was supposedly hospitalized after falling off a horse. Sylvester asked his father to get him a baseball autographed by Babe Ruth. Prior to the start of the World Series, the boy's parents sent urgent telegrams to the Yankees in St. Louis, asking for an autographed ball. Soon, the family received an airmail package with two balls, one autographed by the entire St. Louis Cardinals team and the other with signatures from a number of Yankees players and a personal message from Ruth saying, [...] "I'll knock a homer for you on Wednesday". After Ruth hit three home runs in Game4 on October 6, newspapers reported that Sylvester's condition had miraculously improved. After the World Series had ended, Ruth made a highly publicized visit to Sylvester's home, in which <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>said</b> to Ruth, [...] "I'm sorry the Yanks lost the series". In the spring of 1927, Sylvester's uncle visited Ruth and thanked him for saving the boy's life. Ruth asked how the boy was doing and asked the uncle to give the boy his regards. After the man left, Ruth, who was seated next to a group of baseball writers, said, [...] "Now who the hell is Johnny Sylvester?" ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the best}} {{understanding}} of historians {{is that the}} story originated weeks earlier when Admiral Joel T. Boone, Hoover's physician, was exploring trails in the surrounding mountains and came upon an eleven-year-old boy named Ray Burraker. Boone learned that Burraker and his eight brothers and sisters had never attended school. The area in which they lived, known as Dark Hollow, had no school. [...] When the President heard of Burraker, he said [...] "Tell that boy if he will bring me an opossum down here I'll give him five dollars." [...] Boone delivered the message, but nothing happened until August10, the President's birthday, when Boone visited Dark Hollow again on horseback. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>said</b> he had caught an opossum for the President. With the inducement of riding to camp, the shy boy was persuaded to present his opossum directly to the President and his guest, Charles Lindbergh. Anne Morrow Lindbergh was amused to hear that Burraker and his friends {{had never heard of}} her famous husband.|$|E
2500|$|Property law governs {{ownership}} and possession. Real property, sometimes called 'real estate', refers to ownership {{of land and}} things attached to it. Personal property, refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry or intangible rights, such as stocks and shares. A right in rem is {{a right to a}} specific piece of property, contrasting to a right in personam which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns mortgages, rental agreements, licences, covenants, easements and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under intellectual property, company law, trusts and commercial law. An example of a basic case of most property law is Armory v Delamirie [...] A chimney sweep's boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three halfpence and that he would buy it. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>said</b> he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him. Lord Chief Justice Pratt ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keepers") until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a right of possession in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something could belong to someone), but the boy's possessory interest was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but not all.|$|E
6000|$|There was a {{children}}'s band, - harp, cornet, and piano, - and Mrs. Alicumpaine and Mrs. Orange bustled {{among the}} children to persuade them to take partners and dance. But they were so obstinate! For {{quite a long time}} they would not be persuaded to take partners and dance. Most of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>said,</b> 'Thanks; much! But not at present.' And {{most of the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>said,</b> 'Thanks; much! But never do.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I thought {{myself that}} they were tigers," [...] the man said, rather shamefacedly, [...] "but <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>said</b> they were certain {{that they were}} not; and I was not sure, myself, {{one way or the}} other." ...|$|R
