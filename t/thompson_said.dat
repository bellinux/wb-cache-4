5|$|For his part, <b>Thompson</b> <b>said</b> {{he thought}} the judge was trying to protect Moore's {{criminal}} conviction at any cost. He also complained about the judge's ethics, saying a local attorney {{who claimed to have}} influence on the judge had assured him the case would be dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson's team, and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website.|$|E

He also revealed that Collins managed to play the drums on the album despite the adverse effects of his recent spinal operation. Collins confirmed he had to tape drumsticks to his hands to play. Bob Babbitt on his forum stated that the album would be released in September, and confirmed that a filmed showcase would take place in Europe and the US during the summer.|$|E

500|$|After {{spending}} {{nearly all}} of the month campaigning in Iowa, <b>Thompson</b> <b>said</b> at the end of July that if he failed to win or come in second at the state's straw poll, he would drop out of the race. He admitted that the campaign significantly lacked funding and that he was spending large amounts of his own money to stay afloat. [...] He believed that a strong showing could improve his ability to raise funds, and planned to bus supporters to the straw poll and pay the $35 entrance fee for each.|$|E
500|$|Mark Thompson {{countered that}} [...] "the Coast Guard laid bare [...] own {{complacency}}" [...] by blaming {{the sinking of}} Fitzgerald on industry-wide complacency since it had inspected Fitzgerald just two weeks before she sank. The loss of Fitzgerald also exposed the USCG's lack of rescue capability on Lake Superior. <b>Thompson</b> <b>said</b> that ongoing budget cuts had limited the USCG's ability to perform its historical functions. He further noted that USCG rescue vessels were unlikely to reach {{the scene of an}} incident on Lake Superior or Lake Huron within 6to 12hours of its occurrence.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, {{nine months}} into a tour with Linda Gail Lewis {{promoting}} their collaboration You Win Again, Lewis left, later filing claims against Morrison for unfair dismissal and sexual discrimination. Both claims were later withdrawn, and Morrison's solicitor said, [...] "(Mr Morrison's) pleased that these claims have finally been withdrawn. He accepted a full apology and comprehensive retraction which represents a complete vindication of his stance from the outset. Miss Lewis {{has given a}} full and categorical apology and retraction to Mr Morrison."

500|$|Jack Thompson {{would later}} vow to {{permanently}} ban the game during {{the release of}} the sequel Manhunt 2. <b>Thompson</b> <b>said</b> he planned to sue Take-Two/Rockstar in an effort to have both Manhunt 2 and Grand Theft Auto IV banned as [...] "public nuisances", saying [...] "killings have been specifically linked to Take-Two's Manhunt and Grand Theft Auto games. [...] asked Take-Two and retailers to stop selling Take-Two's 'Mature' murder simulation games to kids. They all refuse. They are about to be told by a court of law that they must adhere to the logic of their own 'Mature' labels.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the test}} pilots at Edwards praised Armstrong's {{engineering}} ability. Milt <b>Thompson</b> <b>said</b> he was [...] "the most technically capable of the early X-15 pilots". Bill Dana said Armstrong [...] "had a mind that absorbed things like a sponge". Those who flew for the Air Force tended {{to have a different}} opinion, especially people like Yeager and Pete Knight, who did not have engineering degrees. Knight said that pilot-engineers flew {{in a way that was}} [...] "more mechanical than it is flying", and gave this as the reason why some pilot-engineers got into trouble: their flying skills did not come naturally.|$|E
500|$|Lonnie Thompson, Earth Science {{professor}} at Ohio State University, whose work on retreating glaciers {{was featured in}} the film, was pleased with how his research was presented. [...] "It's so hard given the breadth of this topic to be factually correct, {{and make sure you}} don't lose your audience," [...] <b>Thompson</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "As scientists, we publish our papers in Science and Nature, but very few people read those. Here's another way to get this message out. To me, it's an excellent overview for an introductory class at a university. What are the issues and what are the possible consequences of not doing anything about those changes? To me, it has tremendous value. It will reach people that scientists will never reach." ...|$|E

500|$|For his efforts, Gravel {{attracted}} some attention: famed writer Norman Mailer {{would say}} he [...] "provided considerable excitement" [...] and was [...] "good-looking enough to have played leads in B-films", while Rolling Stone correspondent Hunter S. <b>Thompson</b> <b>said</b> Gravel [...] "probably said {{a few things that}} might have been worth hearing, under different circumstances ..." [...] Yet, the whole process had been doubly disastrous for the Democrats. The time consumed with the nominating and seconding and other speeches of all the vice-presidential candidates had lost the attention of the delegates on the floor and pushed McGovern's speech until 3:30a.m. The haste with which Eagleton had been selected led to surprise when his past mental health treatments were revealed; he withdrew from the ticket soon after the convention, to be replaced by Sargent Shriver.|$|E
500|$|Following the Queen Elizabeth Hall performance, {{the band}} members {{discussed}} working together. In mid-2004, they began to write and rehearse new material. The result was a double CD, Present, released in April 2005. Critical response was favourable; BBC Music's Peter Marsh said the group was [...] "willing {{to push the envelope}} a little, and bless them for that", while AllMusic' Dave <b>Thompson</b> <b>said</b> the group [...] "never made a less than fabulous album in their lives. And they're not about to start now." [...] A reunion concert took place at the Royal Festival Hall, London, on 6 May 2005, which was released as Real Time in March 2007. The Festival Hall concert was followed by several European dates in the summer and autumn.

500|$|Multiple reviewers {{described}} {{the game as}} [...] "original" [...] or [...] "unique" [...] and praised its script's range of emotions and humor. IGN's Scott <b>Thompson</b> <b>said</b> the game teetered between solemn and audacious in its dialogue and gameplay, and noted its deviance from RPG tropes in aspects such as choice of attacks in battle. He found the game both [...] "bizarre and memorable". Official Nintendo Magazine Simon Parkin thought the game's script was its best asset, as [...] "one of the medium's strongest and idiosyncratic storylines" [...] that fluctuated [...] "between humorous and poignant". GameZone David Sanchez thought its script was [...] "clever" [...] and [...] "sharp", as it displayed {{a wide range of}} emotions that made him want to talk to all non-player characters. GamesTM wrote that the game designers spoke with their players through the non-playable characters, and noted how Itoi's interests shaped the script, its allusions to popular culture, and its [...] "strangely existential narrative framework".|$|E

500|$|Asher's life is {{complicated}} by his mother and brother. He has been a father-figure to Sol since a young age, and, as revealed in episode nine, has cared for him through their mother's schizophrenic episodes. Thompson assessed that Asher {{is not necessarily the}} best role model for Sol, but is willing to {{go to great lengths to}} protect him and ensure his success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch to secure Sol a place in the dance group. <b>Thompson</b> <b>said</b> that looking after Sol has [...] "taken a toll on [...] ". Although he initially feels optimistic about moving to Walford, he loses perspective and makes a mistake by sleeping with Naz. Thompson deemed this out of character for Asher, as he loves his brother so much, but opined that despite his mistakes, Asher is still a good brother: [...] "At heart, he's like anyone trying to do well. He wants to escape his old past and do well by his brother." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} the long range shoot at Vieques, Iowas new {{executive}} officer, Commander John Morse, directed a main battery drill, {{over the objections of}} his gun crews, in which Turrets One and Two fired while both were pointed 15° off the starboard side of the ship's bow. At this angle, one of Turret Two's guns was firing over Turret One. During the shoot, according to Turret Two's left gun captain, Jack Thompson, one of the powder bags in the left gun began to smolder before the breechlock was closed. <b>Thompson</b> <b>said</b> that he was barely able to close and latch the breechlock before the gun discharged on its own. The concussion from Turret Two's guns shredded Turret One's gun bloomers (the canvas covers {{at the base of the}} main gun barrels) and damaged Turret One's electrical system. Dan Meyer said of the shoot that it was [...] "the most frightening experience I have ever had in my life. The shock wave blew out the turret officer's switchboard and the leads. We had no power, no lights for a time. Men were screaming. There was panic." ...|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 2005, Thompson {{supported}} {{a campaign to}} discourage Take-Two’s subsidiary, Rockstar Games, from releasing a game called Bully, in which, according to Thompson, [...] "what you are in effect doing is rehearsing your physical revenge and violence against those whom you have been victimized by. And then you, like Klebold and Harris in Columbine, become the ultimate bully." [...] According to Thompson, the game [...] "shows you how to—by bullying—take over your school. You punch people; you hit them with sling shots; you dunk their heads in dirty toilets. There's white-on-black crime in the game. You bludgeon teachers and classmates with bats. It's absolutely nuts." [...] Thompson sued Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target, Circuit City, GameStop, and Toys 'R' Us, seeking an order to bar the game’s release. He also participated in a protest at Rockstar's office that also included students from Peaceaholics, a Washington, D.C. mentoring organization. <b>Thompson</b> <b>said</b> he hoped that the pressure would get retailers to refuse to carry the game. In March 2006, a Florida school board he had lobbied passed a resolution criticizing the game, but only urged retailers not to sell the game to minors.|$|E
5000|$|Daniel Levitin {{has criticized}} Pinker for {{referring}} to music as an [...] "auditory cheesecake" [...] in the book.

500|$|The {{film was}} {{negatively}} received by critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that only 20% of critics gave the film a positive review, {{with an average}} rating of 3/10, based on 5 reviews. Movies.com's Dave White compared what he considered the film's poor animation to the animation of The Wild, and criticized some dialogue of the film judged [...] "vaguely Shakespearean", satirizing the fact that [...] "children like English pronouns 15th century." [...] Sam Adams of the Los Angeles Times called the film a [...] "genuine tragedy, although not in the Shakespearean sense" [...] and wrote that a [...] "comprehensive list of what's wrong with Romeo & Juliet: Sealed With a Kiss would stretch farther than the unabridged works of William S." [...] LA Weeklys Luke Y. <b>Thompson</b> <b>said</b> that the film [...] "should find its primary audience among college potheads who like to watch '70s Hanna-Barbera creations on the Cartoon Network late at night." [...] Common Sense Media writer Renee Schonfeld said in his 2012 review that it was [...] "an amateurish effort with a grating villain, tired jokes, and sub-par music". He gave it 2 out of 5 stars.|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{first met}} Janet Reno in November 1975, when {{he applied for}} {{a job as an}} {{assistant}} state's attorney in Miami-Dade County, Florida, but was not hired. In 1988, he ran for prosecutor against then-incumbent Dade County State Attorney Janet Reno, after she had declined his request to prosecute Neil Rogers. Thompson gave Reno a letter at a campaign event requesting that she check a box to indicate whether she was homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual. <b>Thompson</b> <b>said</b> that Reno then put her hand on his shoulder and responded, [...] "I'm only interested in virile men. That’s why I'm not attracted to you." [...] He filed a police report accusing her of battery for touching him. In response, Reno asked Florida governor Bob Martinez to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate. The special prosecutor rejected the charge, concluding that it was [...] "a political ploy". Reno was ultimately re-elected with 69% of the vote. Thompson repeated allegations that Reno was a lesbian when she was nominated as U.S. Attorney General, leading one of her supporters, lieutenant governor Buddy MacKay, to dismiss him as a [...] "kook".|$|E
500|$|Thompson's [...] "high-profile crusades" [...] {{have made}} him an enemy of video game aficionados. On occasion, Thompson has sparred {{directly}} with the gaming industry and its fans. In 2005, he wrote {{an open letter to}} Entertainment Software Association president Doug Lowenstein, making what he described as [...] "a modest video game proposal" [...] (an allusion to the title of Jonathan Swift's satirical essay, A Modest Proposal) to the video game industry: <b>Thompson</b> <b>said</b> he would donate $10,000 to a charity designated by Take-Two CEO Paul Eibeler if any video game company would create a game including the scenario he described in the letter. The scenario called for the main character, whose son was killed by a boy who played violent video games, to murder a number of industry executives (including one modeled on Eibeler) and go on a killing spree at the Electronic Entertainment Expo. Video game fans promptly began working to take Thompson up on his offer, resulting in the game I'm O.K – A Murder Simulator, among others. Afterwards, he claimed that his proposal was satire, and refused to make the promised donation.|$|E

Scott eventually turned to Jaffe, who said that if his vote had been necessary, he would also have cut Thompson.|$|R
50|$|When the Lottery {{began in}} 1974, {{proceeds}} {{went into the}} state's General Revenue Fund. In 1985, a law was enacted to earmark all Lottery proceeds to the CSF. Interestingly, a similar initiative was vetoed a year earlier by then-governor James R. <b>Thompson,</b> who <b>said</b> the bill earmarking Lottery proceeds to the CSF would give people the wrong impression that the Lottery would be a panacea for school funding.|$|R
5000|$|Daniel Goure and Thompson are two Lexington defense analysts. Goure was {{formerly}} {{associated with the}} Center for Strategic and International Studies and holds a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University. Thompson was deputy director of Georgetown University's Security Studies Program and taught there for two decades, during which time he received a Ph.D. from the university. Thompson argued in favor of continued C-17 production in 2009 and against this production in 2010. He also taught briefly at Harvard. <b>Thompson</b> has <b>said</b> that the United States is {{likely to engage in}} war against Vietnam again and so needs the EFV to storm their beaches. [...] He has also called for a shift in American defense spending towards items such as the Littoral Combat Ship and the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II that can be exported to allies. <b>Thompson</b> has <b>said</b> that [...] "The United States cannot continue to spend, especially on defense, the way it has been over the past decade." [...] Despite being funding by defense contractors, Goure has argued that the use of these contractors is a sign of an army in decline.|$|R
