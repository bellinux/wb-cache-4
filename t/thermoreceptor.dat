50|$|The {{somatosensory}} {{system is a}} part of the sensory nervous system. The {{somatosensory system}} is a complex system of sensory neurons and pathways that responds to changes at the surface or inside the body. The axons (as afferent nerve fibers), of sensory neurons connect with, or respond to, various receptor cells. These sensory receptor cells are activated by different stimuli such as heat and pain, giving a functional name to the responding sensory neuron, such as a <b>thermoreceptor</b> which carries information about temperature changes. Other types include mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors, and nociceptors and they send signals along a sensory nerve to the spinal cord where they may be processed by other sensory neurons and then relayed to the brain for further processing. Sensory receptors are found all over the body including the skin, epithelial tissues, muscles, bones and joints, internal organs, and the cardiovascular system.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>thermoreceptor</b> is a non-specialised sense receptor, or more {{accurately}} the receptive {{portion of a}} sensory neuron, that codes absolute and relative changes in temperature, primarily within the innocuous range. In the mammalian peripheral nervous system, warmth receptors {{are thought to be}} unmyelinated C-fibres (low conduction velocity), while those responding to cold have both C-fibers and thinly myelinated A delta fibers (faster conduction velocity). [...] The adequate stimulus for a warm receptor is warming, which results in an increase in their action potential discharge rate. Cooling results in a decrease in warm receptor discharge rate. For cold receptors their firing rate increases during cooling and decreases during warming. Some cold receptors also respond with a brief action potential discharge to high temperatures, i.e. typically above 45°C, and this is known as a paradoxical response to heat. The mechanism responsible for this behavior has not been determined.|$|E

40|$|Dry {{eye disease}} (DED) affects > 10 % of the {{population}} worldwide, and it provokes an unpleasant sensation of ocular dryness, whose underlying neural mechanisms remain unknown. Removal of the main lachrymal gland in guinea pigs caused long-term reduction of basal tearing accompanied by changes in the architecture and density of subbasal corneal nerves and epithelial terminals. After 4 weeks, ongoing impulse activity and responses to cooling of corneal cold <b>thermoreceptor</b> endings were enhanced. Menthol (200 μM) first excited and then inactivated this augmented spontaneous and cold-evoked activity. Comparatively, corneal polymodal nociceptors of tear-deficient eyes remained silent and exhibited only a mild sensitization to acidic stimulation, whereas mechanonociceptors were not affected. Dryness-induced changes in peripheral cold <b>thermoreceptor</b> responsiveness developed in parallel with a progressive excitability enhancement of corneal cold trigeminal ganglion neurons, primarily due to an increase of sodium currents and a decrease of potassium currents. In corneal polymodal nociceptor neurons, sodium currents were enhanced whereas potassium currents remain unaltered. In healthy humans, exposure of the eye surface to menthol vapors or to cold air currents evoked unpleasant sensations accompanied by increased blinking frequency that we attributed to cold <b>thermoreceptor</b> stimulation. Notably, stimulation with menthol reduced the ongoing background discomfort of patients with DED, conceivably due to use-dependent inactivation of cold thermoreceptors. Together, these data indicate that cold thermoreceptors contribute importantly to the detection and signaling of ocular surface wetness, and develop under chronic eye dryness conditions an injury-evoked neuropathic firing that seems to underlie the unpleasant sensations experienced by patients with DED.

40|$|AbstractDry {{eye disease}} (DED) is a multifactorial {{disorder}} affecting {{the composition and}} volume of tears. DED causes ocular surface dryness, cooling, and hyperosmolality, leading ultimately to corneal epithelium damage and reduced visual performance. Ocular discomfort is the main clinical symptom in DED. However, the peripheral neural source of such unpleasant sensations is still unclear. We analyzed in excised, superfused mouse eyes, the effect of NaCl-induced hyperosmolality (325 – 1005 mOsm·kg− 1) on corneal cold <b>thermoreceptor</b> and polymodal nociceptor nerve terminal impulse (NTI) activity. Osmolality elevations at basal corneal temperature (33. 6 °C) linearly increased the ongoing NTI frequency of cold thermoreceptors, at a mean rate of 0. 34 imp·s− 1 / 10 mOsm. This frequency increase became significant with osmolality values greater than 340 mOsm. Comparison of cold <b>thermoreceptor</b> activity increase induced by a dynamic temperature reduction of 1. 8 °C under iso- and hyperosmolal (360 -mOsm) conditions provided evidence that more than 50 % of the increased firing response was attributable to hyperosmolality. Comparatively, activation of corneal polymodal nociceptor endings by hyperosmolal solutions started with values of 600 mOsm and greater. Sensitization of polymodal nociceptors by continuous perfusion with an “inflammatory soup” (bradykinin, histamine, prostaglandin E 2 [PGE 2], serotonin, and adenosine triphosphate [ATP]) did not enhance their activation by hyperosmolal solutions. High osmolality also altered the firing pattern and shape of cold and polymodal NTIs, possibly reflecting disturbances in local membrane currents. Results strongly suggest that tear osmolality elevations in the range observed in DED predominantly excite cold thermoreceptors, supporting the hypothesis that dryness sensations experienced by these patients are due, at least in part, to an augmented activity of corneal cold thermoreceptors...|$|E

These cation currents are key regulators of cellular excitability in the heart and many neurons in the nervous system. Subunit composition determines the gating properties and cAMP sensitivity of native Ih currents. We investigated the functional properties of I h in adult mouse cold <b>thermoreceptor</b> neurons from the trigeminal ganglion, identified by their high sensitivity to moderate cooling and responsiveness to menthol. All cultured cold-sensitive (CS) neurons expressed a fast activating Ih, which was fully blocked by extracellular Cs+ or ZD 7288 and had biophysical properties {{consistent with those of}} heteromeric HCN 1 -HCN 2 channels. In CS neurons from HCN 1 (-/-) animals, Ih was greatly reduced but not abolished. We find that Ih activity is not essential for the transduction of cold stimuli in CS neurons. Nevertheless, Ih has the potential to shape the excitability of CS neurons. First, Ih blockade caused a membrane hyperpolarization in CS neurons of about 5 mV. Furthermore, impedance power analysis showed that all CS neurons had a prominent subthreshold membrane resonance in the 5 - 7 Hz range, completely abolished upon blockade of Ih and absent in HCN 1 null mice. This frequency range matches the spontaneous firing frequency of cold <b>thermoreceptor</b> terminals in vivo. Behavioural responses to cooling were reduced in HCN 1 null mice and after peripheral pharmacological blockade of Ih with ZD 7288, suggesting that Ih {{plays an important role in}} peripheral sensitivity to cold. © 2009 The Authors.

40|$|TRPM 8 is {{a member}} of the {{transient}} receptor potential ion channel superfamily, which is expressed in sensory neurons and is activated by cold and cooling compounds, such as menthol. Activation of TRPM 8 by agonists takes place through shifts in its voltage activation curve, allowing channel opening at physiological membrane potentials. Here, we studied the role of the N-glycosylation occurring at the pore loop of TRPM 8 on the function of the channel. Using heterologous expression of recombinant channels in HEK 293 cells we found that the unglycosylated TRPM 8 mutant (N 934 Q) displays marked functional differences compared with the wild type channel. These differences include a shift in the threshold of temperature activation and a reduced response to menthol and cold stimuli. Biophysical analysis indicated that these modifications are due to a shift in the voltage dependence of TRPM 8 activation toward more positive potentials. By using tunicamycin, a drug that prevents N-glycosylation of proteins, we also evaluated the effect of the N-glycosylation on the responses of trigeminal sensory neurons expressing TRPM 8. These experiments showed that the lack of N-glycosylation affects the function of native TRPM 8 ion channels in a similar way to heterologously expressed ones, causing an important shift of the temperature threshold of cold-sensitive <b>thermoreceptor</b> neurons. Altogether, these results indicate that post-translational modification of TRPM 8 is an important mechanism modulating cold <b>thermoreceptor</b> function, explaining the marked differences in temperature sensitivity observed between recombinant and native TRPM 8 ion channels. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

A major candidate is TRPM 8, a non-selective cation channel of the transient receptor potential family, activated by menthol and low temperatures. We investigated the role of TRPM 8 in cold sensing during transient expression in mouse cultured hippocampal neurones, a tissue that lacks endogenous expression of thermosensitive TRPs. In the absence of synaptic input, control hippocampal neurones were not excited by cooling. In contrast, all TRPM 8 -transfected hippocampal neurones were excited by cooling and menthol. However, in comparison to cold-sensitive trigeminal sensory neurones, hippocampal neurones exhibited much lower threshold temperatures, requiring temperatures below 27 °C to fire action potentials. These results directly demonstrate that expression of TRPM 8 in mammalian neurones induces cold sensing, albeit at lower temperatures than native TRPM 8 -expressing neurones, suggesting the presence of additional modulatory mechanisms in the cold response of sensory neurones...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCold {{hypersensitivity}} is {{the hallmark}} of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy, which develops in nearly all patients under this chemotherapy. To date, pain management strategies have failed to alleviate these symptoms, hence development of adapted analgesics is needed. Here, we report that oxaliplatin exaggerates cold perception in mice as well as in patients. These symptoms are mediated by primary afferent sensory neurons expressing the <b>thermoreceptor</b> TRPM 8. Mechanistically, oxaliplatin promotes over-excitability by drastically lowering the expression of distinct potassium channels (TREK 1, TRAAK) and by increasing the expression of pro-excitatory channels such as the hyperpolarization-activated channels (HCNs). These findings are corroborated by the analysis of TREK 1 -TRAAK null mice and use of the specific HCN inhibitor ivabradine, which abolishes the oxaliplatin-induced cold hypersensibility. These results suggest that oxaliplatin exacerbates cold perception by modulating the transcription of distinct ionic conductances that together shape sensory neuron responses to cold. The translational and clinical implication of these findings would be that ivabradine may represent a tailored treatment for oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy...|$|E

In response to cold stress, a reflex increase in sympathetic nervous system activity mediates reductions in skin blood flow. Reflex vasoconstriction during cold exposure is markedly impaired in aged skin, contributing to the relative inability of healthy older adults to maintain core temperature during mild cold stress {{in the absence of}} appropriate behavioral thermoregulation. This compromised reflex cutaneous vasoconstriction in healthy aging can occur as a result of functional deficits at multiple points along the efferent sympathetic reflex axis, including blunted sympathetic outflow directed to the skin vasculature, reduced presynaptic neurotransmitter synthesis and/or release, and altered end-organ responsiveness at several loci, in addition to potential alterations in afferent <b>thermoreceptor</b> function.
