5|$|Any {{pigmentation}} {{or black}} spots on muzzle, {{black or white}} hairs anywhere on the coat, particularly in the ears, {{at the end of}} the tail and around <b>the</b> <b>muzzle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jaws: The jaws {{should be}} strong and powerful. <b>The</b> <b>muzzle</b> should be of medium length {{and should not be}} too tapered. The jaws should hang {{slightly}} and curve gracefully back.|$|E
5|$|The face is {{the flat}} {{vertical}} plane at the foremost edge of <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> (and {{of the entire}} piece).|$|E
50|$|The PMR grenade {{launcher}} is a muzzle-fired {{grenade launcher}} of Transnistrian origin. The device is inserted on <b>the</b> <b>muzzles</b> of AKS-74U rifles.|$|R
50|$|Head: The skull, {{which is}} {{relatively}} flat, {{is the same}} or slightly shorter than <b>the</b> <b>muzzle's</b> length. Its forehead is generally broad.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>muzzle</b> {{astragal}} and fillets are {{a series}} of three narrow rings running around the outside of the chase just behind the neck. Sometimes also collectively called the chase ring.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} of Kritosaurus navajovius is only {{represented by a}} partial skull and lower jaws, and associated postcranial remains. The greater portion of <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> and upper beak are missing.|$|E
5|$|Some {{minor changes}} in the gun {{construction}} were introduced during production. The carriage received a modified shoulder guard and traverse controls (carriage M4A1, standardized on 29 January 1942). Although ordnance requested an upgrade of all M4 carriages to M4A1, this process was not completed. Another change was a threaded barrel end to accept a big five-port muzzle brake (gun M3A1, adopted on 5 March 1942). According to some sources, the latter was intended to avoid kicking too much dust {{in front of the}} gun, which hindered aiming; however, the brake {{turned out to be a}} safety problem when firing canister ammunition and consequently the M3A1 went into combat without <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> brake. Other sources mention <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> brake was intended to soften a recoil and they say that it was dropped simply because additional recoil control measures were not really needed.|$|E

5000|$|... a {{stuffing}} for plush toys or {{for real}} animals in taxidermy. It was traditionally used in stuffing Teddy bears {{and is still}} is for <b>the</b> <b>muzzles</b> of some collectible bears.|$|R
5|$|The Il-40 first flew on 7 March 1953, {{and flight}} tests {{revealed}} no serious shortcomings in the air. The operational CG {{was too far}} aft, but this was only a minor problem when landing, taking off and taxiing, especially when coupled with the rather short wheelbase. The biggest problem {{proved to be the}} guns and their effect on the engines. During the first aerial test of the cannons at the end of March 1953 <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> flash temporarily blinded the pilot and both engines flamed out. The pilot was able to restart the engines and returned safely, but Sergey Ilyushin immediately started an investigation into the cause of the engine problems. Ground tests with high-speed cameras revealed that none of <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> brakes or blast suppressors tested made any difference; the engines would hiccup even if only a single gun fired just five to ten rounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{older and}} more-stable forms of cannon were muzzle-loading {{as opposed to}} breech-loading— {{in order to be}} used they had to have their {{ordnance}} packed down the bore through <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> rather than inserted through the breech.|$|E
5|$|The {{swell of}} <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> {{refers to the}} slight swell in the {{diameter}} of the piece {{at the very end of}} the chase. It is often chamfered on the inside to make loading the cannon easier. In some guns, this element is replaced with a wide ring and is called a muzzle band.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>muzzled</b> blenny Omobranchus punctatus (Valenciennes), {{native to}} the Indo-Pacific region, is {{recorded}} in the Southwestern Atlantic coast, inhabiting natural and artificial substrates in the proximities of three large Brazilian seaports (states of Bahia, Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina). Due to its habitat and habits, the introduction of this species was probably by ship or oil rigs, presumably associated within fouling. It is also argued that <b>the</b> <b>muzzled</b> blenny can maintain populations in natural and artificial (mariculture facilities) coastal environments in the Southwestern Atlantic.

60|$|At half-past four the Zulus, concentrating again, {{attacked}} the northern side, {{and made some}} desperate rushes up to <b>the</b> <b>muzzles</b> of <b>the</b> English rifles, and the fighting for a time was almost hand to hand.|$|R
5|$|Bombard weaponry: The oldest {{representation}} of a bombard {{can be found in}} the Chinese town of Ta-tsu. In 1985, the Canadian historian Robin Yates visited the Buddhist cave temples when he saw a sculpture on the wall depicting a demon holding a hand-held bombard. <b>The</b> <b>muzzle</b> seems to have a blast and flames coming from it which some believe is proof of some type of super gun. Yates examined the cave and believed the drawings dated back to the late 12th century.|$|E
5|$|It {{has a long}} broad {{nose and}} muzzle, with thick ears covered in silky hair that usually end around the tip of <b>the</b> <b>muzzle.</b> Its chest is of medium size that descends down to {{the same level as}} the elbows. Both the {{forequarters}} and the hindquarters are well muscled. Its tail typically does not extend beyond the hock and is normally straight.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{generally}} have thin tooth enamel compared to anthropoid primates. This {{may result in}} extra wear and breakage to the anterior (front) teeth due to heavy use in grooming, feeding, and fighting. Little other dental health information is available for lemurs, except that wild ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve occasionally exhibit abscessed maxillary canines (seen as open wounds on <b>the</b> <b>muzzle)</b> and tooth decay, possibly due to the consumption of non-native foods.|$|E
50|$|Omobranchus punctatus, <b>the</b> <b>muzzled</b> blenny or <b>the</b> spotted oyster blenny is {{a species}} of combtooth blenny found in coral reefs in the Pacific and Indian ocean. This species can reach a length of 9.5 cm SL.|$|R
50|$|Ongoing {{military}} utilization began during World War II, {{and includes}} covering <b>the</b> <b>muzzles</b> of rifle barrels to prevent fouling, the waterproofing of firing assemblies in underwater demolitions, and storage of corrosive materials and garrotes by paramilitary agencies.|$|R
60|$|A look {{of intense}} {{surprise}} overspread {{the faces of}} the two men when they entered and saw the Englishmen sitting comfortably by the fire, and both, as if by instinct threw forward <b>the</b> <b>muzzles</b> of their muskets.|$|R
5|$|Since 2012, Federal Cartridge Company {{produces}} a 5.7×28mm round under their American Eagle brand. Designated the AE5728A, this cartridge uses a 40-grain total metal jacket (TMJ) projectile, that is atypical {{in that it}} does not use a copper plated bullet; sectioned pictures show a very thick full copper jacket. The AE5728A casings are of FN manufacture, and <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> velocity is slightly lower than that of the SS197SR.|$|E
5|$|Slender {{with thin}} legs {{and a short}} tail, the four-horned {{antelope}} has a yellowish brown to reddish coat. The underparts and the insides of the legs are white. Facial features include black markings on <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> and behind the ears. A black stripe marks the outer surface of each leg. Females have four teats far back on the abdomen. The hair feels coarse, more {{like that of a}} deer than the glossy hair typical of antelopes. The fetlocks are marked with white patches.|$|E
5|$|The Thin Man gun-type {{design was}} at that time based on the fissibility of the very pure plutonium-239 isotope so far only {{produced}} in microgram quantities by the Berkeley cyclotron. When the Hanford production reactors came on-line in early 1944, the mix of plutonium-239 and plutonium-240 obtained was found to have a high rate of spontaneous fission. To avoid pre-detonation, <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> velocity of the gun-type design would need to be greatly raised, making it impractically long.|$|E
50|$|Vanguard took {{ten minutes}} to clear for action and then fired two rounds from each stern gun. However the extreme {{overhang}} of the stern prevented <b>the</b> <b>muzzles</b> running clear, {{with the result that}} there was a minor fire.|$|R
60|$|Wampus did not halt. His {{eyes fixed}} upon the bandit's ugly features, still puffing his cigar and with {{hands in his}} pockets he walked {{deliberately}} past Patsy and Beth and straight up to <b>the</b> <b>muzzles</b> of <b>the</b> revolvers.|$|R
60|$|It {{now seemed}} as if the revenge of the Otaheitans had been sated, for after the last tragic act they {{remained}} for some time in front of Brown's house talking, and resting their hands on <b>the</b> <b>muzzles</b> of their guns.|$|R
5|$|The breech {{refers to}} the mass of solid metal behind {{the bottom of the}} bore {{extending}} {{to the base of the}} breech and including the base ring; it also generally {{refers to the}} end of the cannon opposite <b>the</b> <b>muzzle,</b> i.e., the location where the explosion of the gunpowder begins as opposed to the opening through which the pressurized gas escapes.|$|E
5|$|The bristle-faced free-tailed bat (Mormopterus eleryi), {{previously}} {{known as}} the hairy-rostrum or hairy-nosed freetail bat, is a small insectivorous bat {{that is the only}} member of the molossid sub-genus Setirostris. The bristle-faced free-tailed bat differs from all other bats in the Family Molossidae by possessing unique dentition, a distinctive echolocation call, diagnostic genital and glans penis morphology and small body size. It is readily distinguished from other Mormopterus species by the presence of characteristic stout bristles on <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> and face.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the confusion and loss of leadership aboard the American vessel, the British boarding party was being effectively organised. A number of small-arms men rushed aboard Chesapeake, led by Broke, including the purser, Mr G. Aldham, and the clerk, Mr John Dunn. Aldham and Dunn were killed as they crossed the gangway, {{but the rest of}} the party made it onto Chesapeake. Captain Broke, at the head of not more than twenty men, stepped from the rail of the waist-hammock netting onto <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> of the after-carronade of Chesapeake, and from there he jumped down to her quarterdeck. As the British boarded there were no American officers left on the quarterdeck to organise resistance.|$|E
60|$|This {{is quite}} {{far enough to}} imbue me with great respect for the Martian firearm, and some telepathic force must have warned me against an attempt to escape in broad {{daylight}} from under <b>the</b> <b>muzzles</b> of twenty of these death-dealing machines.|$|R
50|$|In about 1917, all 18-pounders {{began to}} be fitted with a new {{calibrating}} range scale. This allowed <b>the</b> gun's <b>muzzle</b> velocity to be set on it and automatically corrected the range for the difference between <b>the</b> actual <b>muzzle</b> velocity and <b>the</b> standard one.|$|R
50|$|In {{the middle}} of the 17th century, the matchlock muskets of some line {{infantry}} were equipped with bayonets. Bayonets were attached to <b>the</b> <b>muzzles</b> of muskets and were used when line troops entered melee combat. They also helped to defend against cavalry.|$|R
