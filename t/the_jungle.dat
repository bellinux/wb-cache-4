5|$|Bears, crocodiles, golden jackals, leopards {{and snakes}} {{are the main}} predators of <b>the</b> <b>jungle</b> cat. The golden jackal, particularly, can be a major {{competitor}} to the cat. When it encounters a threat, <b>the</b> <b>jungle</b> cat will vocalise before engaging in attack, producing sounds like small roars – a behavior uncommon for {{the other members of}} Felis. The meow of <b>the</b> <b>jungle</b> cat is also somewhat lower than that of a typical domestic cat. <b>The</b> <b>jungle</b> cat can host parasites such as Haemaphysalis and Heterophyes species.|$|E
