500|$|The [...] season saw teams running [...] "off-throttle blown diffusers", {{which created}} {{downforce}} by forcing fuel through {{the engine to}} produce exhaust gases and directing it over the diffuser when the driver was not applying the throttle. This concept was originally banned in incremental phases, with increasingly restrictive rules on what teams could and could not do, with a full ban to be applied from the 2011 British Grand Prix onwards. However, the incremental ban was controversial, with several teams applying for and receiving permission to circumvent the total ban. After discussion between the FIA and engine manufacturers, the original regulations were restored, with the full ban delayed until 2012. The regulations in 2012 governed {{the design of the}} exhaust with the teams agreeing to strict constraints on the position of the exhaust tailpipe. This resulted in the exhaust exiting the bodywork much higher up than in 2011, and no longer {{in the vicinity of the}} diffuser. Several teams, including Williams and Mercedes used the Young Driver Tests in Abu Dhabi as an opportunity to <b>test</b> <b>parts</b> for the 2012 season in the face of the ban. In October 2011, a clarification to the amended rules was issued, effectively banning [...] "exotic" [...] engine maps; in November, further amendments were introduced, completely banning the practice of blowing exhaust gasses over parts of the car to improve downforce, following a bid by several teams to allow it under certain conditions. Further amendments were made in February 2012 when Mercedes alerted the FIA to a loophole in the regulations that would allow teams to continue using a partially blown diffuser. The FIA responded by re-writing the software governing the engine's Electronic Control Unit to close the loophole.|$|E

5000|$|Languages with no {{explicit}} Boolean data type, like C90 and Lisp, {{may still}} represent truth values {{by some other}} data type. Common Lisp uses an empty list for false, and any other value for true. C uses an integer type, where relational expressions like [...] and logical expressions connected by [...] and [...] are defined to have value 1 if true and 0 if false, whereas the <b>test</b> <b>parts</b> of , , , etc., treat any non-zero value as true. Indeed, a Boolean variable may be regarded (and implemented) as a numerical variable with one binary digit (bit), which can store only two values. The implementation of Booleans in computers are most likely represented as a full word, rather than a bit; this is usually due to the ways computers transfer blocks of information.|$|E

50|$|Regression testing {{focuses on}} finding defects after a major code change has occurred. Specifically, {{it seeks to}} uncover {{software}} regressions, as degraded or lost features, including old bugs that have come back. Such regressions occur whenever software functionality that was previously working correctly, stops working as intended. Typically, regressions occur as an unintended consequence of program changes, when the newly developed part of the software collides with the previously existing code. Common methods of regression testing include re-running previous sets of test cases and checking whether previously fixed faults have re-emerged. The depth of testing depends on the phase in the release process {{and the risk of}} the added features. They can either be complete, for changes added late in the release or deemed to be risky, or be very shallow, consisting of positive tests on each feature, if the changes are early in the release or deemed to be of low risk. Regression testing is typically the largest test effort in commercial software development, due to checking numerous details in prior software features, and even new software can be developed while using some old test cases to <b>test</b> <b>parts</b> of the new design to ensure prior functionality is still supported.|$|E

While the <b>test</b> <b>parts</b> and the experiments described are still work in progress, the generic requirements derived from them can serve {{as a starting point for}} the design of other micro additive manufacturing related studies and their decompositions can help structure future work...|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{reliability}} of congeneric tests, specifically designed reliability measures have been proposed. This paper emphasizes that such measures rely on a unidimensionality hypothesis, which can neither be confirmed nor rejected when {{there are only three}} <b>test</b> <b>parts,</b> and will invariably be rejected when there are more than three <b>test</b> <b>parts.</b> Jackson and Agunwamba's (1977) greatest lower bound to reliability is proposed instead. Although this bound has a reputation for overestimating the population value when the sample size is small, this is no reason to prefer the unidimensionality-based reliability. Firstly, the sampling bias problem of the glb does not play a role when the number of <b>test</b> <b>parts</b> is small, {{as is often the case}} with congeneric measures. Secondly, glb and unidimensionality based reliability are often equal when there are three <b>test</b> <b>parts,</b> and when there are more <b>test</b> <b>parts,</b> their numerical values are still very similar. To the extent that the bias problem of the greatest lower bound does play a role, unidimensionality-based reliability is equally affected. Although unidimensionality and reliability are often thought of as unrelated, this paper shows that, from at least two perspectives, they act as antagonistic concepts. A measure, based on the same framework that led to the greatest lower bound, is discussed for assessing how close is a set of variables to unidimensionality. It is the percentage of common variance that can be explained by a single factor. An empirical example is given to demonstrate the main points of the paper...|$|E
40|$|A {{nationwide}} Federal employment {{program for}} recent college graduates required applicants {{to take a}} multiple abilities test battery. The abilities, each assessed by a separate test part, were Verbal, Judgment, Induction, Deduction, and Number. To equate alternate forms, a sixth test part {{was included in the}} test battery. This part could be an additional, parallel version of one of the five ability <b>test</b> <b>parts.</b> At the first test administration one form (A) was used operationally, and each of the five parts of two alternate forms (B and C) was administered to a randomly selected subgroup of test takers. Small but consistent score increases from the first test form to the second were observed. The greatest effects were for Induction and Deduction, next largest for Number, and least for Verbal and Judgment. At two subsequent administrations the order of alternate form administration was reversed (B and A, C and A), providing a counterbalanced design to assess the effects of alternate form, samples, and practice. Data from 66, 303 test takers supported the hypotheses of practice effects. These data suggest that practice is most effective for item types constructed according to specific rules, next effective for <b>test</b> <b>parts</b> subject to speededness, and least effective for <b>test</b> <b>parts</b> tapping general information...|$|E

The first uses of AM process were for rapid prototyping or for 3 D sample illustration due to the weak performances of mechanical characteristics of the materials available.
