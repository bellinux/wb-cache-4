He explained that, as a naturally introverted person, he found it extremely exhausting having <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> every day. With that being said, Ward remained working on the series as a storyboard artist and storyline writer, and every single fifth-season episode (with the exception of [...] "A Glitch is a Glitch") featured story input by Ward.|$|E
500|$|When she {{was growing}} up, Aaliyah {{attended}} Detroit schools and believed she was well-liked, but got teased for her short stature. She recalled coming into her own prior to age 15 and grew to love her height. Her mother would tell her to be happy that she was small and compliment her. Other children disliked Aaliyah, {{but she did not}} stay focused on them. [...] "You always have <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> who are jealous, but there were so few it didn't even matter. The majority of kids supported me, which was wonderful. When it comes to dealing with negative people, I just let it in one ear and out the other. Those people were invisible to me." [...] Even in her adult life, she considered herself small. She had [...] "learned to accept and love" [...] herself and added: [...] "...the {{most important thing is to}} think highly of yourself because if you don't, no one else will".|$|E
500|$|The third {{song on the}} album, [...] "I Believe It", was {{the subject}} of the band's only music video from Toil. The video shows the band singing the song acoustically in the studio, much like the version that is {{featured}} on the album. Instrumentally, the song is guitar-driven and features the mandolin. The lyrics remind the listener to continue going forward even if it is painful. The song has been seen as symbol of the band's faith. The title track, [...] "Toil", is an acoustic protest song that was compared by one reviewer to the Bruce Springsteen album Wrecking Ball. The lyrics tell the story of an unhappy, overworked, working-class man. The song ends with the lyrics, [...] "I'm a slave to that whistle call. I’m a slave." [...] The tenth song, [...] "6'10"", is an alt-country ballad that was written in response to people making jokes about Bawinkle's height. The man depicted in the track is [...] tall and has <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> questioning him about why he does not play basketball.|$|E

6000|$|Her {{projects}} were excellent, {{but did not}} prosper as rapidly as she hoped, for, having <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>people,</b> not things, unexpected obstacles were constantly arising. The [...] "Home for Decayed Gentlewomen," [...] as the boys insisted on calling her two newly repaired houses, started finely {{and it was a}} pleasant sight to see the comfortable rooms filled with respectable women busy at their various tasks, surrounded by the decencies and many of the comforts which make life endurable. But, presently, Rose was disturbed to find that the good people expected her {{to take care of them}} in a way she had not bargained for. Buffum, her agent, was constantly reporting complaints, new wants, and general discontent if they were not attended to. Things were very neglected, water pipes froze and burst, drains got out of order, yards were in a mess, and rents behind-hand. Worst of all, outsiders, instead of sympathizing, only laughed and said, [...] "We told you so," [...] which is a most discouraging remark to older and wiser workers than Rose.|$|E

The old man who is head-waiter at the inn has been kind to me, my dear, in his way, and he and the landlady had hard words together about it. A quarrel, a shocking, violent quarrel. He has lost his place in consequence. The woman, his mistress, lays all the blame of it to my door. She is a hard woman; and she has been harder than ever since Bishopriggs went away. I have missed a letter at the inn--I must have thrown it aside, I suppose, and forgotten it. I only know that I remembered about it, and couldn't find it last night. I told the landlady, and she fastened a quarrel on me almost before the words were out of my mouth. Asked me if I charged her with stealing my letter. Said things to me--I can't repeat them. I am not very well, and not able <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> of that sort. I thought it best to leave Craig Fernie this morning.
