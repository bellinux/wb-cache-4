25|$|Secondary school {{teachers}} needed a B.Ed. until 2010. Since 2011, {{they have to}} have a B.Sc. or BA related to secondary school subjects plus a one-year post-graduate diploma in teaching (PGDT) which includes a practicum accounting for 30% of the credit hours. Student <b>teachers</b> <b>also</b> take an entrance examination and have an interview for PGDT enrolment.|$|E

25|$|The second, more publicized controversy, arising in {{the fall}} of 2007, {{involved}} accusations of grade tampering. The accusations, whose source was past faculty and included a former teacher who filed a legal claim against the school, alleged that the school sometimes changed Fs to passing grades. Some past <b>teachers</b> <b>also</b> said that they felt overwhelming pressure to give good grades while teaching at the school. UCSD's office of audit and management advisory services was assigned to investigate the accusations, and the school's principal, Dr. Doris Alvarez, and academic adviser Phil Ensberg were placed on leave.|$|E

25|$|One of Thaksin's {{educational}} reforms was school decentralisation, as {{mandated by}} the 1997 Constitution. It was to delegate school management from the over-centralized and bureaucratised Ministry of Education to Tambon Administrative Organizations (TAOs), but met with massive widespread opposition from Thailand's 700,000 teachers, who would be deprived of their status as civil servants. <b>Teachers</b> <b>also</b> feared that TAOs lacked the ability to manage schools. In the face of massive teacher protests and several threats of school closure, Thaksin compromised and gave teachers whose schools were transferred to TAO management two years to transfer to other schools.|$|E
25|$|From 2005/2006 to 2006/2007, {{there was}} a {{significant}} increase in the number of schools in Puntland, up 137 institutions from just one year prior. During the same period, the number of classes in the region increased by 504, with 762 more <b>teachers</b> <b>also</b> offering their services. Total student enrollment increased by 27% over the previous year, with girls lagging only slightly behind boys in attendance in most regions. The highest class enrollment was observed in the northernmost Bari region, and the lowest was observed in the under-populated Ayn region. The distribution of classrooms was almost evenly split between urban and rural areas, with marginally more pupils attending and instructors teaching classes in urban areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{academics}} {{is based}} on the same core subjects throughout a student's tenure at Regis. This is more strongly influenced with specific educational programs that are used through textbooks. Specific programs provide a strong base of knowledge for Regis students. Many <b>teachers</b> <b>also</b> try to provide their own form of a structured and well-managed curriculum for their own subject. As of 1993 all students are required to take Catholic religion classes and attend Catholic religious services. Non-Catholic students take the classes as a form of academic education. In late January 2012, Regis students were also highly recognized at the St. Pius Academic Rally. The participating students won four Gold medals, four Silver medals, two Bronze medals, and four Honorable Mentions.|$|E

25|$|Research {{shows that}} {{children}} from lower-income households who get good-quality pre-Kindergarten education {{are more likely}} to graduate from high school, attend college, hold a job and have higher earnings. In 2010, the U.S. ranked 28th out of 38 advanced countries in the share of four-year-olds enrolled in public or private early childhood education. Gains in enrollment stalled after 2010, as did growth in funding, due to budget cuts arising from the Great Recession. Per-pupil spending in state-funded programs declined by 12% after inflation since 2010. The U.S. differs from other countries in that it funds public education primarily through sub-national (state and local) taxes. The quality of funding for public education varies based on the tax base of the school system, with significant variation in local taxes and spending per pupil. Better <b>teachers</b> <b>also</b> raise the educational attainment and future earnings of students, but they tend to migrate to higher income school districts. Among developed countries, 70% of 3-year-olds go to preschool, versus 38% in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{school is}} focused around The Courts which {{is next to}} the Abbey. This {{consists}} of the School Custos (reception), Big School Room, Chapel and Library as well as Mathematics, English, Classics (Classical civilisation, Latin and Greek) and History classrooms. The Courts also contains School House. Geography, Geology, Art and Economics are contained in the Carrington Building, with DT workshops and classrooms nearby. The Pilkington Building contains Chemistry and Physics with the Turing Building containing Biology. The Grove contains two computer rooms and Languages; French, German and Spanish (with many of the <b>teachers</b> <b>also</b> speaking other languages, including Russian, Italian, Norwegian, Swedish, Mandarin and more, though these are not commonly in the Syllabus, but can be requested for out-of-timetable lessons). RS and Philosophy and Ethics are in the Medway building near the Grove and Music is held in the purpose-built Music School (opened in Summer 2010).

2500|$|<b>Teachers</b> <b>also</b> {{showed some}} sympathy for McInerney. [...] "We failed Brandon," [...] a teacher said.

[...] Hundreds of children from the school have signed a petition requesting that McInerney be tried as a juvenile.|$|E
2500|$|Many <b>teachers</b> <b>also</b> play {{an active}} role in the {{advancement}} of the school's vision. For example, Fanny K. Ennever, PhD, a former teacher in the Physical Science Department and adjunct assistant professor at Columbia University, was responsible for securing a $27,500 grant in both 2004 and 2005 for developing and modifying the Bronx Science chemistry laboratory curriculum, in order to make sessions less [...] "cookbook" [...] and more inquiry-based.|$|E
2500|$|The {{resulting}} {{new schools}} consequently required {{larger numbers of}} teachers. Furthermore, higher standards of educational attainment came to be expected in schools, so {{the quality of the}} <b>teachers</b> <b>also</b> needed to be raised. It became necessary, therefore, to develop efficient and affordable methods of improving the standards of [...] teacher training. The solution adopted, along the 1870s, 80s and 90s, was the education of [...] "pupil teachers" [...] for a four-year period (1418 years of age) in specific training Centres.|$|E

2500|$|After the Nazi {{takeover}} in Germany the new Reich's government streamlined {{foreign policy}} according to Nazi ideals, using financial pressure especially. The Nazi {{emphasis was on}} creating the image that Germany and Germanness were equal to Nazism. Thus, all non-Nazi aspects of German culture and identity were discriminated against as un-German. All international schools of German language subsidised or fully financed by government funds were obliged to redraw their educational programmes and to solely employ teachers aligned to the Nazi party. The teachers in Bethlehem were financed by the Reich government, so Nazi <b>teachers</b> <b>also</b> took over there.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Thomasites {{were the}} largest group of pioneers with the purpose of educating the Filipinos, they were not the first to be {{deployed}} by Washington, D.C. [...] A few weeks before the arrival of USS Thomas, U.S. Army soldiers had already begun teaching Filipinos the English language, thus in effect laying the foundation of the Philippine public school system. [...] The U.S. Army opened the Philippinesâ€™ first public school in Corregidor Island, after Admiral George Dewey vanquished the Spanish Pacific fleet in Manila Bay on May 1, 1898. [...] Also, {{a few weeks before the}} arrival of USS Thomas, another group composed of 48 American <b>teachers</b> <b>also</b> arrived in the Philippines, aboard the USAT Sheridan.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} reduce the burden of field testing, the Texas State Board of Education has not {{released}} to the public those questions used to determine student scores on the Spring 2005 or Spring 2007 TAKS tests. [...] Regrettably, this prevents public review of the questions and answers (for appropriateness and correctness) and denies opportunities for students, teachers, and others to learn from the [...] tests. [...] However, university-level experts in each of the fields review each high school-level test for accuracy. [...] Grade-level <b>teachers</b> <b>also</b> review test items for appropriateness prior to field testing and review the field test results in order to select the best questions for inclusion in the test item bank.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} aspect of the model was the Student Advisory Group (STAG). The STAG model meant a teacher met every day with a cross-graded group of students. The STAG teacher was responsible for the overall progress of his/her students. Thus the STAG teacher collected data from the subject teachers on these particular students. This included academic progress, attendance, and behavior data. The STAG <b>teacher</b> <b>also</b> contacted parents and conducted parent-teacher conferences for these students. The STAG teacher did not necessarily teach the student any of the courses. The STAG <b>teacher</b> <b>also</b> booked students into resource periods for extra instruction when necessary.|$|R
