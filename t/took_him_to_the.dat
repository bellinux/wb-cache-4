5|$|Born in South Wales, Edwards {{moved with}} his parents to England and sang in choirs as a child. He {{witnessed}} his first opera (Giuseppe Verdi's Un ballo in maschera) at eleven years old when his parents <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. Seven years later, he was conducting Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta H.M.S. Pinafore on that same podium. Edwards played violin and trumpet through grammar {{school and high school}} but abandoned performance for conducting.|$|E
5|$|He {{joined the}} Lodge of Antiquity in London in 1863, and {{that same year}} became Grand Chaplain of United Grand Lodge. While still Rector of Swillington, his new masonic duties <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> consecration of many new lodges, and saw him deliver the oration at the laying of the {{foundation}} stone for the new extension to Freemason's Hall in Great Queen Street, London, the next year. In the same period, Woodford started to contribute articles on masonic history, starting with his researches into the old York lodges. He became known to local booksellers {{as he began to}} collect old manuscripts.|$|E

5|$|Pacino {{was born}} in the East Harlem {{neighborhood}} of New York City, to Sicilian-American parents Salvatore and Rose (née Gerardi) Pacino. His parents divorced when he was two years old. His mother then <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Bronx to live with her parents, Kate and James Gerardi, who, coincidentally, had come from a town in Sicily named Corleone. His father, who was from San Fratello of Sicily, moved to Covina, California to work as an insurance salesman and restaurateur, and had not been in his life since then.|$|E

The guards finally allowed him to see Anna, and Beauchamp was angered that they had underplayed her critical condition. He stayed with her until he could no longer feel her pulse; then the guards <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gallows to be hanged before he died of his stab wounds.|$|E
5|$|After 103 {{appearances}} for Third Division Gillingham {{he moved}} on to top-flight Coventry City in 1983 for a fee approaching £85,000. He struggled with injury during his time at Highfield Road, and was never popular with the fans. Keith Houchen also recalled that he did not get along with manager John Sillett and was prone to sulking when left out of the team. Despite this he managed to play over 100 games for City over a four-year period before Leeds United manager Billy Bremner <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Second Division for a £110,000 fee. Near the end of his first season at Leeds he played in the club's FA Cup Semi-final defeat to former club Coventry at Hillsborough, as Coventry won 3–2 in extra time. Leeds suffered further heartbreak in 1987 by losing the play-off Final to Charlton Athletic, again after extra time.|$|E

5|$|Gil González Dávila set {{out from}} Santo Domingo early in 1524, with the {{intention}} of exploring the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north coast of Honduras, where he was beset by a storm. In order to lighten the load of his ships, he ordered that a number of horses be thrown overboard. This event resulted in the place being named Puerto de Caballos ("Port of Horses"). González Dávila landed on the north coast, with authorisation to conquer Honduras from the king, after having sent the royal fifth of his proceeds from campaigns in Panama and Nicaragua, a sum totalling 112,524 gold castellanos. Puerto de Caballos later developed into an important staging point for the colonisation of the region.|$|E
5|$|Giridhar {{lost his}} {{eyesight}} {{at the age}} of two months. On 24 March 1950, his eyes were infected by trachoma. There were no advanced facilities for treatment in the village, so he was taken to an elderly woman in a nearby village who was known to cure trachoma boils to provide relief. The woman applied a paste of myrobalan to Giridhar's eyes to burst the lumps, but his eyes started bleeding, resulting in the loss of his eyesight. His family <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King George Hospital in Lucknow, where his eyes were treated for 21 days, but his sight could not be restored. Various Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Allopathic, and other practitioners were approached in Sitapur, Lucknow, and Bombay, but to no avail. Rambhadracharya has been blind ever since. He cannot read or write, as he does not use Braille; he learns by listening and composes by dictating to scribes.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{graduated}} on July 1, 1843, ranked 21st in a {{class of}} 39, and was promoted to the rank brevet second lieutenant. Glad to leave the academy, he planned to resign his commission after his four-year term of duty. Despite his excellent horsemanship, he was not assigned to the cavalry, but to the 4th Infantry Regiment. He served as regimental quartermaster, managing supplies and equipment. Grant's first assignment <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jefferson Barracks near St. Louis, Missouri. Commanded by Colonel Stephen W. Kearny, the barracks was the nation's largest military base in the west. Grant was happy with his new commander, but looked forward {{to the end of his}} military service and a possible teaching career.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{enjoyed a}} {{successful}} career with the France national team, winning {{the first of his}} 123 caps in June 1997, when his good form for Monaco was rewarded with a call-up to the Under-20 French national team, where he played in the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship alongside future teammates William Gallas and David Trezeguet. Within four months, France head coach Aimé Jacquet called Henry up to the senior team. The 20-year-old made his senior international debut on 11 October 1997 in a 2–1 win against South Africa. Jacquet was so impressed with Henry that he <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1998 FIFA World Cup. Although Henry was a largely unknown quantity at international level, he ended the tournament as France's top scorer with three goals. He was scheduled to appear as a substitute in the final, where France beat Brazil 3–0, but Marcel Desailly's sending off forced a defensive change instead. In 1998, he was made Chevalier (Knight) of the Légion d'honneur, France's highest decoration.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher {{was born}} in Hürth, North Rhine-Westphalia, to Rolf Schumacher, a bricklayer, and his wife Elisabeth. When Schumacher was four, his father {{modified}} his pedal kart by adding a small motorcycle engine. When Schumacher crashed it into a lamp post in Kerpen, his parents <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> karting track at Kerpen-Horrem, where he became {{the youngest member of}} the karting club. His father soon built him a kart from discarded parts and at the age of six Schumacher won his first club championship. To support his son's racing, Rolf Schumacher took on a second job renting and repairing karts, while his wife worked at the track's canteen. Nevertheless, when Michael needed a new engine costing 800 DM, his parents were unable to afford it; he was able to continue racing with support from local businessmen.|$|E

He had no cricketing {{associations}} on his father's side of the family, but his maternal uncle, Ron Campion, played for the Glebe club in Sydney Grade Cricket. Campion trained for cricket near the O'Neill family home, at Bexley Oval. O'Neill accompanied his uncle to cricket {{from the age of}} seven and was given batting practice {{at the end of each}} session. At Bexley Primary school, O'Neill was denied a chance to play cricket as the school did not field a team. Moving on to Kogarah Intermediate High School, O'Neill played cricket in defiance of a teacher who recommended that he take up athletics. As a teenager, O'Neill idolised Keith Miller after his uncle <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sydney Cricket Ground: O'Neill saw Miller play that day and was impressed with the way he hit the ball off the back foot.|$|E

5|$|This {{desertion}} further discouraged Bardanes, and, {{reluctant to}} face the loyalist army in battle, he opted for a negotiated surrender through the mediation of Joseph, the hegumenos of the Kathara monastery who had officiated at Constantine VI's second marriage. Bardanes received a letter signed by the Patriarch Tarasios and several leading senators which guaranteed that {{neither he nor his}} subordinates would be punished if they surrendered. As a further guarantee of good faith, Nikephoros sent his own gold cross along with the letter. Satisfied by these assurances, on 8 September Bardanes left his army and, through Nicaea, sought refuge in the monastery of Herakleios at Cius. From there, he embarked on a ship that <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island of Prote. Taking the monastic name Sabbas, Bardanes then entered a monastery that he had founded there in the past.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses {{differed}} {{about whether}} Tom McLaury {{was carrying a}} weapon during the shootout or not. No revolver or rifle was found near his body {{and he was not}} wearing a cartridge belt. Wyatt testified that he had arrested Tom earlier that day when he found him carrying a weapon earlier in violation of a city ordinance. He pistol-whipped him and <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> courthouse where he was fined. Saloon-keeper Mehan testified that Tom had deposited his revolver at the Capital Saloon on 4th Street and Fremont after his arrest and before the fight, between 1 and 2 p.m. Several Cowboy witnesses testified that Tom was unarmed and claimed that the Earps had murdered a defenseless man.|$|E
5|$|Bonnet's initial cruise <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{coast of}} the Colony of Virginia, near the {{entrance}} of the Chesapeake Bay, where he captured and plundered four vessels, and burned the Barbadian ship Turbet to keep news of his crimes from his home island. He then sailed north to New York City, taking two more ships, and picking up naval supplies and releasing captives at Gardiners Island. By August 1717, Bonnet had returned to the Carolinas, where he attacked two more ships, a brigantine from Boston and a Barbadian sloop. He stripped the brigantine, but brought the cargo-filled Barbadian sloop to an inlet off North Carolina to use for careening and repairing the Revenge. After the Barbadian sloop's tackle was used to careen the Revenge, the ship was dismantled for timber, and the remains were then burned. In September 1717, Bonnet set course for Nassau, which was then an infamous pirate den on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas. En route, he encountered, fought, and escaped from a Spanish man of war. The Revenge was badly damaged, Bonnet was seriously wounded, and half the crew of the sloop was killed or wounded in the encounter. Putting in at Nassau, Bonnet replaced his casualties and refitted the Revenge, increasing the sloop's armament to twelve guns.|$|E

5|$|By lap 105, Kyle Busch held a 3.1-second {{lead over}} Kenseth. Three laps later, the third caution was {{triggered}} when Stewart's car made heavy {{contact with the}} turn-two wall after his right-front tire burst. Stewart grazed his foot and climbed out of his car; emergency workers helped take him to a waiting car that <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> infield medical center for further examination. All of the race leaders, including Edwards, chose to make pit stops for tires and car adjustments under caution. NASCAR required Edwards to fall back {{to the end of}} the longest line because one of his crew members had allowed one of his tires to roll away from his pit box during his stop. Kyle Busch maintained the lead at the restart on lap 114; he was followed by Kenseth and Gordon. Kenseth passed Kyle Busch to take the lead on lap 117. On the same lap, Gordon passed Busch. By lap 135, Kenseth had opened up a 2.2-second lead over Gordon. Biffle moved in front of Burton for fourth place on the 139th lap. On lap 144, Robby Gordon's right-front tire blew, causing him to hit the turn-two wall, and the fourth caution was triggered. All of the race leaders made pit stops during the caution.|$|E
5|$|Gil González Dávila set {{out from}} the Caribbean island of Hispaniola early in 1524, with the {{intention}} of exploring the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north coast of Honduras. After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil Gónzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement somewhere near the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River. Although they were in a desperate state, and near-starving, they were still there when Cortés passed through en route to Honduras, and were absorbed into his expedition.|$|E
5|$|Hare was {{released}} on 5 February 1829—his extended stay in custody had been undertaken for his own protection—and was assisted in leaving Edinburgh in disguise by the mailcoach to Dumfries. At one of its stops he was recognised by a fellow-passenger, Erskine Douglas Sandford, a junior counsel who had represented Wilson's family; Sandford informed his fellow passengers of Hare's identity. On arrival in Dumfries the news of Hare's presence spread and a large crowd gathered at the hostelry where he was due to stay the night. Police arrived and arranged for a decoy coach to draw off the crowd while Hare escaped through a back window and into a carriage which <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town's prison for safekeeping. A crowd surrounded the building; stones were thrown {{at the door and}} windows and street lamps were smashed before 100 special constables arrived to restore order. In the small hours of the morning, escorted by a sheriff officer and militia guard, Hare was taken out of town, set down on the Annan Road and instructed to make his way to the English border. There were no subsequent reliable sightings of him and his eventual fate is unknown.|$|E
