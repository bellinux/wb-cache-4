5|$|Ugg boots (sometimes called uggs) in Australia and New Zealand are a unisex {{style of}} {{sheepskin}} boot. In many other countries, however, UGG boots are a well-known brand of footwear owned by Deckers. The boots {{are made of}} twin-faced sheepskin with fleece {{on the inside and}} with a tanned outer surface, often with a synthetic sole. The boots originated in Australia and New Zealand, initially as utilitarian footwear worn for warmth and comfort. UGG boots emerged as a fashion <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States in the late 1990s and as a world-wide <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Arctic terns are {{long-lived}} birds, {{with many}} reaching fifteen to {{thirty years of}} age. They eat mainly fish and small marine invertebrates. The species is abundant, with an estimated one million individuals. While the <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of individuals in the species {{as a whole is}} not known, exploitation in the past has reduced this bird's numbers in the southern reaches of its range.|$|E
5|$|At the {{southern}} part of their range, the Arctic tern has been reducing in numbers. Much of this is due to lack of food. However, most of these birds' range is extremely remote, with no apparent <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> species as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Ruthenium is {{the first}} in a {{downward}} <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> melting and boiling points and atomization enthalpy in the 4d transition metals after the maximum seen at molybdenum, because the 4d subshell is more than half full and the electrons are contributing less to metallic bonding. (Technetium, the previous element, has an exceptionally low value that is off the trend due to its half-filled 4d55s2 configuration, though the small amount of energy needed to excite it to a 4d65s1 configuration indicates that it is not as far off the <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 4d series as manganese in the 3d transition series.) Unlike the lighter congener iron, ruthenium is paramagnetic at room temperature, as iron also is above its Curie point.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} an extratropical cyclone, Chantal maintained scattered convection near its center, though its main area of convection and clouds extended to its north. Midday on August 1, the cyclone struck Newfoundland along the Avalon Peninsula, hitting the Placentia Area with full force. It subsequently intensified to attain winds of near hurricane-force. On August 3 the cyclone underwent a final weakening <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> far northern Atlantic Ocean, and on August 5 the extratropical remnants of Chantal merged with another extratropical cyclone {{to the east}} of Iceland.|$|E
5|$|Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources {{have been}} {{interpreted}} {{as part of}} a wider <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s of so-called 'heritage cinema': period pieces and costume dramas that celebrated the history, culture and landscape of France. It was the official policy of President François Mitterrand, elected in 1981, and particularly his Minister of Culture Jack Lang, to promote these kinds of films through increased funding of the ailing French film industry. Berri's pair of films stand as the most prominent example of this effort. It has also been suggested that the treatment given the outsider Jean de Florette by the locals was symbolic of the growing popularity of the anti-immigration movement, led by politicians like Jean-Marie Le Pen.|$|E
5|$|Still Jennifer Lopez is a women's {{fragrance}} {{endorsed by}} American entertainer Jennifer Lopez, released by Coty, Inc. in October 2003. The fragrance contains notes of sake, mandarin, early grey, pink freesia, honeysuckle, orange flower, sandalwood, amber and orris. Still Jennifer Lopez {{followed in the}} footsteps of Glow by JLo, an international success that shaped the fragrance industry and began a <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> celebrity endorsement of fragrance. The release of Still Jennifer Lopez was not anticipated due to the negative publicity generated from Lopez's film Gigli (2003) and a fall-out with her manager Benny Medina. Several fragrance industry experts noted that it could ruin the success of Glow by JLo. It was also noted that her public image at the time would have irreparable effects on the fragrance's performance.|$|E

5|$|Strontium is a {{divalent}} silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose properties are mostly intermediate between and {{similar to those}} of its group neighbors calcium and barium. It is softer than calcium and harder than barium. Its melting (777°C) and boiling (1655°C) points are lower than those of calcium (842°C and 1757°C respectively); barium continues this downward <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> melting point (727°C), but not in the boiling point (2170°C). The density of strontium (2.64g/cm3) is similarly intermediate between those of calcium (1.54g/cm3) and barium (3.594g/cm3). Three allotropes of metallic strontium exist, with transition points at 235 and 540°C.|$|E
5|$|The {{downward}} <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{number of}} unskilled jobs available {{throughout the country}} is continuing.

Speaking in March 2007, Chancellor Gordon Brown stated that around 50,000 teenagers would be paid a training allowance to sign up to college-based courses, with estimates on the available number of apprenticeships available to double to around 500,000 by 2020, with 80% being available in England, which will be an increase from the current 250,000 apprenticeships available, offered by 130,000 employers.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} role of {{the private}} sector forms an important <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ADF's logistics arrangements. During the 1990s many of the ADF's support functions were transferred to the private sector to improve the efficiency with which they were provided. Since these reforms most of the 'garrison' support services at military bases have been provided by private firms. The reforms also led to many of the ADF's logistics units being disbanded or reduced in size. Since this time private firms have increasingly been contracted to provide critical support to ADF units deployed outside Australia. This support has included transporting equipment and personnel and constructing and supplying bases.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field {{is one of}} heteroscedastic fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field strength. It has gone {{up and down in}} the past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1970s {{construction}} continued, {{starting with}} the Mathematical Sciences Building, followed by the Offenhauer Towers in 1971 and Industrial Education & Technology Building in 1972. The Business Building and the Industrial Arts Building opened in 1973 and University Hall received renovations in 1974 that included new seating, an improved sound system, and air conditioning in the auditorium. In 1979, the Student Recreation Center and the Moore Musical Arts Center opened. In 1970, the Board of Trustees ended an alcoholic beverage ban on campus. The Cardinal Room, an on-campus eatery, began serving beer. A growing <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1960s and early 1970s was the development of large apartment complexes adjacent to campus. By the 1970s approximately 4,000 students lived in private, off-campus housing. On campus, Darrow Hall became the first co-ed dorm in 1972 with men and women inhabiting alternating floors.|$|E

5|$|Dead Phoenix {{was going}} to be a 3D shoot 'em up {{featuring}} a winged man named Phoenix. Based on trailer footage, IGN compared the gameplay to Panzer Dragoon. Players would take control of a winged man as he flies around shooting massive enemies, with the aid of allies on foot. Capcom's announcement described the setting as a mythical floating city, full of monsters and dragons. Game Informer announced that a Japanese release was planned in mid-2003. The game was believed to be canceled by May 2003, but Capcom stated at a press conference prior to the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) that it was still in development. IGN speculated that the game may have been retooled as a new Kid Icarus title, based on Nintendo's <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 2000s of licensing properties to third parties. It was canceled in August 2003 after failing to appear at E3.|$|E
5|$|Grunge music hit the {{mainstream}} {{in the early}} 1990s with Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana being signed to major record labels. Grunge fashion began to break into mainstream fashion in mid-1992 for both sexes and peaked in late 1993 and early 1994. As it picked up momentum, the grunge tag was being used by shops selling expensive flannelette shirts {{to cash in on}} the trend. Ironically, the non-conformist look suddenly became a mainstream <b>trend.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> fashion world, Marc Jacobs presented a show for Perry Ellis in 1992, featuring grunge-inspired clothing mixed with high-end fabrics. Jacobs found inspiration in the ‘realism’ of grunge streetwear; he mixed it with the luxury of fashion by sending models down the catwalk in beanies, floral dresses and silk flannel shirts. Unfortunately, this did not sit well with the brand owners and Jacobs was dismissed. Other designers like Anna Sui, also drew inspiration from grunge during the spring/summer 1993 season.|$|E
5|$|Phase IV: As Rome {{began to}} {{struggle}} to keep control over its sprawling territories, military service continued to be salaried and professional for Rome's regular troops. However, the trend of employing allied or mercenary elements was expanded {{to such an extent}} that these troops came to represent a substantial proportion of the armed forces. At the same time, the uniformity of structure found in Rome's earlier military disappeared. Soldiery of the era ranged from lightly armed mounted archers to heavy infantry, in regiments of varying size and quality. This was accompanied by a <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late empire of an increasing predominance of cavalry rather than infantry troops, as well as a requirement for more mobile operations. In this period there was more focus (on all frontiers but the east) on smaller units of independently-operating troops, engaging less in set-piece battles and more in low-intensity, guerilla actions.|$|E
