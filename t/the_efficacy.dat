40|$|Many links {{exist between}} cocaine abuse and stress.

Using male Long-Evans rats, experiments in this thesis tested effects of footshock on <b>the</b> reinforcing <b>efficacy</b> of cocaine using a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. They also examined effects of footshock on <b>the</b> reinforcing <b>efficacy</b> of a half-maximal dose of cocaine. Finally, they tested the effects of footshock on cocaine self-administration in rats initially resistant to acquisition of cocaine self-administration. Footshock did not increase reinforcing efficacy of cocaine on a PR schedule of reinforcement, nor did it enhance sensitivity to a half-maximal dose of cocaine. Footshock did, however, cause acquisition of cocaine self-administration in acquisition-resistant rats. Therefore, while footshock stress may be capable of sensitizing acquisition-resistant rats to <b>the</b> reinforcing <b>efficacy</b> of cocaine, it does not appear that it significantly increases <b>the</b> reinforcing <b>efficacy</b> of cocaine in rats with a history of cocaine self-administration...|$|R
