500|$|... "One of {{the most}} {{important}} things we were looking for in casting was the actors' ability to play the subtleties – <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things</b> that a character doesn't say or do that create the edge, the things that get under your skin and spook you," [...] Morgan said about the auditions.|$|E
500|$|He talked {{openly in}} the music press about his problems, telling the NME: [...] "When I cut myself I feel so much better. All <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things</b> {{that might have been}} {{annoying}} me seem so trivial because I'm concentrating on the pain", and [...] "I'm {{the sort of person who}} wakes up in the morning and needs to pour a bottle down my throat".|$|E

He {{was healthy}} and normal, ate regularly, slept long hours, and yet <b>the</b> growing <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> was {{becoming}} an obsession. Work performed. The phrase haunted his brain.

500|$|Asked {{to choose}} {{the best player in}} history, Henderson declined, saying, [...] "There are guys who have done {{different}} things very well, but I don't know of anyone who mastered everything." [...] Offered the chance to assess his own placement among the game's greats, he said, [...] "I haven't mastered the homers or RBI. <b>The</b> <b>little</b> <b>things,</b> I probably mastered." [...] Of his various records and achievements, he values his career runs scored mark the most: [...] "You have to score to win." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's subplots, however, {{received}} mixed reviews. McNutt wrote that, while Tate {{had given}} a [...] "rather subtle and charming performance", the Nellie-Dwight subplot felt like [...] "a leftover idea" [...] from the previous season. Tedder, on the other hand, liked the Dwight-Nellie subplot for its silliness, concluding that [...] "ongoing plotlines are great, but it's still <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things</b> on this show". Trammell felt that the joke involving font was [...] "cute", {{but he did not}} enjoy the rest, writing that [...] "the resulting antics just weren't that funny".|$|E
500|$|Lady Bracknell's line, [...] "A handbag?", {{has been}} {{called one of the}} most {{malleable}} in English drama, lending itself to interpretations ranging from incredulous or scandalised to baffled. Edith Evans, both on stage and in the 1952 film, delivered the line loudly in a mixture of horror, incredulity and condescension. Stockard Channing, in the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin in 2010, hushed the line, in a critic's words, [...] "with a barely audible 'A handbag?', rapidly swallowed up with a sharp intake of breath. An understated take, to be sure, but with such a well-known play, packed full of witticisms and aphorisms with a life of their own, it's <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things</b> that make a difference." ...|$|E

500|$|On the day [...] "Smile" [...] was released, Allen {{appeared}} on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge with DJ Jo Whiley, performing an acoustic version of [...] "Smile" [...] and {{a cover of}} The Kooks' song [...] "Naïve". At the Secret Garden Party, in September 2006, Allen made a rendition of the song and afterwards stated: [...] "The festival was well good, particularly as Lester, my ex, who I wrote 'Smile' about, and subsequently sold his story to the papers, had a tent called 'the shit tent' positioned directly opposite the main stage. So he and his new girlfriend had {{no option but to}} watch me perform to a couple of thousand people singing 'Smile' back to me. Oh, it's <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things</b> eh!" ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall {{praised the}} episode {{compared}} to the first few episodes of the season, writing it balanced Veronica's character traits well, including her jealousy and generosity. He also wrote that it showed her as a character with some [...] "baser instincts", giving the scene with Jeff as an example. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, gave a mixed review. The reviewer was very critical {{of what he called}} the [...] "'radical feminist fakes her own rape'" [...] storyline, but he praised the episode as the first one of the third season to make the college setting feel natural. Although he thought that the case-of-the-week contributed to his overall positive view of the episode, he thought that [...] "it's mostly <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things</b> that make it work", pointing out Piz's increased role as an example.|$|E
500|$|Stevens' {{teams are}} built around solid {{basketball}} fundamentals and good team work, rather than individual basketball skill. His teams {{are known for}} their defense, forcing opponents into uncharacteristic mistakes. The secret to basketball – and life – is [...] "just to do the job {{to the best of your}} ability and don't worry about anything else," [...] Stevens says. [...] "Win the next game. Win the next possession. That's our focus. It's boring. It's also the way championships are won", he says. In short, Stevens is a strong believer in [...] "The Butler Way" [...] – doing all <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things</b> that transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team. [...] "I tell the players 'the Butler Way' isn't easy to define," [...] Stevens says, [...] "but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball, play with great energy and defend." ...|$|E

500|$|Doctors {{were able}} to catch the disease early on before it spread, unlike the case of {{baseball}} and American football player Bo Jackson. As a result, in April, doctors announced an extremely successful surgery. Jackson spoke out about Emery, speculating {{that they were the}} only two athletes to come back after the disease. Jackson added, [...] "I take my hat off [...] I want him to know I am in his corner. It's a lot of hard work. To come back and play, it takes a very, very special and driven person. He's got a different makeup to want to do all <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things</b> he needs to compete on a professional level." [...] Unlike Jackson, who required numerous hip replacements, Emery had the benefit of advancements in modern medicine, undergoing a very specialized and complex procedure that involved removing 13 centimetres from his right fibula, and then grafting it to the femur to re-introduce a proper blood supply to the area. Holmgren said that while the surgery went better than expected, he did not know exactly how long Emery's recovery would take.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Young Shawn Spencer (Liam James) {{is looking}} for Young Gus. Henry Spencer (Corbin Bernsen) shows Shawn how to sneak around, hiding within his lesson the message to [...] "do <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things</b> right". In present day, Shawn (James Roday) sneaks into the police {{briefing}} room, where he discovers that a five-million dollar engagement ring has been stolen from a hotel vault. Without permission, Shawn and Gus (Dulé Hill) take the case. Shawn is given {{an invitation to the}} wedding. While at the hotel, Shawn listens into Detective Lassiter's (Timothy Omundson) brief about the investigation, and gains valuable information. Dietrich Manheim (Guy Fauchon), a hotel staff member becomes the police's main suspect. After tricking the hotel receptionist, Shawn gains access to the rooms of all police officers and wedding attendees. Shawn walks in on a pre-wedding party, and discovers that the florist quit, and the bridesmaids and groomsmen had to make their own wedding bouquets. Shawn and Gus break into Lassiter's room, and discover an insurance policy on the ring, with a major value.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented {{on the structure of}} the series' first season. [...] "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things,</b> like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E
60|$|What {{was that}} which clicked against his breastplate? He felt, {{and found a}} metal bauble linked to a mesh of his steel armor by a strand of silken hair. He carried <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> to <b>the</b> window, and in the waning light made {{it out to be}} a golden hair {{ornament}} set with precious stones, but he could not tell if <b>the</b> <b>little</b> strand of silken hair were black or brown. Carefully he detached <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing,</b> and, winding <b>the</b> filmy tress about it, placed it within the breast of his tunic. He was vaguely troubled by it, yet why he could scarcely have told, himself.|$|R

2500|$|In 2008, Nyong'o {{starred in}} the short film [...] "East River", {{directed}} by Marc Grey and shot in Brooklyn.

In 2009, she wrote, directed, and produced the documentary In My Genes, about the discriminatory treatment of Kenya's albino population.

2500|$|GameSpot also {{reviewed}} {{all four}} versions. Gerald Villoria scored the PlayStation 2 version 8.8 out of 10, praising {{the differences between}} the fighting styles of the three characters, the controls, the range of enemies and weaponry, and the lip syncing. He concluded [...] "You can really appreciate all the work that went into making sure that all of <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things</b> came together so nicely." [...] Greg Kasavin scored the Xbox version 8.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "one of the finest action RPGs ever made" [...] and lauding it as [...] "a perfect port." [...] Kasavin scored the GameCube version 7.6 out of 10, finding similar faults to IGN's Mirabella. He called it [...] "technically deficient" [...] and argued [...] "the visuals [...] just don't measure up, mostly because it suffers from frame rate issues that are nonexistent in the PS2 version (or the new Xbox version)." [...] He concluded [...] "the game just wasn't optimized for the system." [...] Frank Provo scored the Game Boy Advance version 8 out of 10, praising the enemy AI, the sound and the graphics. He concluded, [...] "If you're looking for a hack-and-slash game on the go, this is the one to get." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also citing McFly as {{influences}} are British pop {{rock band}} The Vamps, who supported McFly on their 2013 [...] Guitarist and vocalist James McVey stated [...] "McFly is a band {{we love to}} be compared to over other bands, simply for the fact of their good musicianship. They write very well and they're very energetic on stage, which is something we try to replicate in our own performances." [...] Drummer Tristan Evans also spoke of the band, explaining [...] "McFly were an influence on me wanting to get into music and we feel like {{the next generation of}} their take on pop," [...] while bassist Connor Ball continued [...] "They're chilled-out and we hope we can have that calm attitude if we ever get that successful." [...] Frontman Brad Simpson also referred to McFly when asked about influences, stating [...] "Their debut album was a first in all of our collections". The band credited their support slot as providing an opportunity to observe the band's skills for their own development. Simpson said [...] "How to provide more energy to our performance and move around the stage was a massive one...McFly have been doing it for years and <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>things</b> we picked up have really improved our live performance." [...] McVey also referred to the band's influence on performances by the Vamps, stating [...] "Before I had seen them in concert, I would never have performed as we do now." [...] The Vamps have covered several songs by McFly in a series of YouTube videos including Love Is Easy, performed alongside Fletcher's sister Carrie Hope Fletcher, [...] "That Girl", filmed as a recreation of the music video including appearances from Poynter, and finally [...] "Five Colours in Her Hair", which featured on the digital EP for their second single [...] "Wild Heart". Their debut album, Meet the Vamps featured the song [...] "High Hopes" [...] which was co-written by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter and produced by Jones. When The Vamps were compared to Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer, Simpson said [...] "We both have a shared admiration for McFly. They've shaped the music of our generation... We find ourselves going to the same minor guitar chords like McFly would." ...|$|E
