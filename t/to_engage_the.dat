5|$|In June 1915, {{passengers}} on Batavier II witnessed {{an attack by}} two German airplanes against a British steamship between the Galloper and the North Hinder Lightships. The attack was broken off when two British airplanes arrived over the ship <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> German aircraft; none of the airplanes were destroyed, and the ship was unscathed.|$|E
5|$|No. 11 Group moved No. 32, 54, 56, and 501 Squadrons, totalling 11 Spitfires and 33 Hurricanes, to the Margate-Canterbury line <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> enemy {{formations}} first. The remaining {{units were}} {{to climb to}} altitude and wait over or near the threatened fighter airfields, until a clearer picture emerged of enemy intentions.|$|E

5|$|The German High Seas Fleet, {{for their}} part, were {{determined}} not <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> British without {{the assistance of}} submarines; and since the submarines were needed more for raiding commercial traffic, the fleet stayed in port {{for much of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The feint {{party was}} {{composed}} of 150 volunteers who ran into the hollow way and began <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> British.

5|$|This {{order of}} battle was almost always followed, the Battle of the Great Plains and the Battle of Zama being among the few notable exceptions. At the Great Plains, Scipio, the Roman general, formed his men up in the usual manner, but once the hastati had begun <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> enemy, he used his principes and triarii as a {{flanking}} force, routing the opposing Carthaginians. At Zama, Scipio arranged his men into columns, side-by-side, with large lanes in between. The opposing Carthaginian elephants were drawn into these lanes where many were killed by velites without inflicting many casualties on the Romans. Once the surviving elephants had been routed, Scipio formed his men into a long line with his triarii and principes in the centre and hastati on the flanks, ready <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> Carthaginian infantry.|$|E
5|$|After the Lancastrians {{had ceased}} loosing their arrows, Fauconberg ordered his archers {{to step forward}} again to shoot. When they had {{exhausted}} their ammunition, the Yorkists plucked arrows off {{the ground in front}} of them—arrows loosed by their foes—and continued loosing. Coming under attack without any effective response of its own, the Lancastrian army moved from its position <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> Yorkists in close combat. Seeing the advancing mass of men, the Yorkist archers shot a few more volleys before retreating behind their ranks of men-at-arms, leaving thousands of arrows in the ground to hinder the Lancastrian attack.|$|E

5|$|Allen's {{force of}} 100 was outnumbered by the pirates and also outgunned, with Alligator {{mounting}} only 12 six-pounders, {{compared to the}} pirates' 14 cannon. Despite being outnumbered, Alligator and her crew were experienced veterans, having taken the Portuguese brig Marianna Flora the year before in a bloody action. Allen was also an experienced commander who had taken command of USS Argus during her engagement with HMS Pelican in the War of 1812. Though Alligator draft was too deep to chase pirate craft inshore, if need be, she could send her cutter, gig, and launch out with boarding parties <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> pirates.|$|E
5|$|At 15:00 Lhermitte {{ordered the}} masts on Preneuse {{to be cut}} away and the frigate and battery then opened fire on Adamant, which was {{carefully}} sailing through the coastal shoals in an effort <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> beached French ship. For {{more than two hours}} Hotham's ship worked its way inshore until at 17:30 it was well positioned to open fire, unleashing its broadside on the wrecked Preneuse. By 17:45 it was clear that further resistance was futile and Lhermitte struck his colours. Preneuse had surrendered, but was likely damaged beyond repair.|$|E

5|$|Baker was {{promoted}} to temporary captain and made a flight commander in No.4 Squadron on 24 October. Two days later, Baker and Lieutenant Thomas Barkell led a formation of nine Snipes. As the patrol drew near Tournai in the afternoon, they intercepted a group of 15 Fokker D.VIIs. The Snipes swept towards the German aircraft, and Baker attempted <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> formation leader, but the machine guns on his Snipe jammed. He brought in his aircraft for a second attempt, and managed to shoot the Fokker down out of control. In all, the Australians destroyed five of the Fokkers before the engagement ended.|$|E
5|$|Despite his pessimism {{expressed}} to the Dutch {{government and the}} mandate {{he had been given}} to surrender the Army, General Winkelman awaited the outcome of events, avoiding actually capitulating until it was absolutely necessary. In this he was perhaps motivated by a desire <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> opposing German troops for as long as possible, to assist the Allied war effort. In the early morning of 14 May, though the situation remained critical, a certain calm was evident in the Dutch Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Elements {{of the two}} armies {{initially}} collided at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, as Lee urgently concentrated {{his forces}} there, his objective being <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> Union army and destroy it. Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig. Gen. John Buford, and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry. However, two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north, collapsing the hastily developed Union lines, sending the defenders retreating {{through the streets of}} the town to the hills just to the south.|$|E

5|$|Hope {{continued}} {{in command of}} small ships for several years, pausing in 1792 to marry his distant cousin, Lady Anne Hope Johnstone. The couple would have two daughters and four sons before Anne's death in 1818. In 1794, Hope was in command of HMS Incendiary, a fireship of the Channel Fleet attached to Lord Howe's force sent <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> French. In March, Hope was given his step to post captain, taking command of the ship of the line HMS Bellerophon, the flagship of Admiral Thomas Pasley.|$|E

With the battle over, Artanis asked the purifiers to join the Daelaam in the war against Amon.
