5|$|Durkheim saw the {{population}} density and growth as key {{factors in the}} evolution of the societies and advent of modernity. As <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> a given area increase, so does the number of interactions, and the society becomes more complex. Growing competition between the more numerous people also leads to further division of labour. In time, the importance of the state, the law and the individual increases, while that of the religion and moral solidarity decreases.|$|E

In 1952, the city's population increased to 7,150 inhabitants; however, the 1960 census showed it decreased to 5,724 inhabitants, and to 5,459 in 1970. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Pichilemu reached 8,844 in 1982, and in 1992, 10,510.

Leiva ridiculed the claim of the remaining representatives to speak on behalf of the people. This wore the patience of the few who were still in the plaza in the rain.

5|$|The {{economic}} activity of residents aged 16–74 was 36% in full-time employment, 13% in part-time employment, 9% self-employed, 3% unemployed, 2% students with jobs, 3% students without jobs, 18% retired, 7% looking after home or family, 6% permanently sick or disabled and 2% economically inactive for other reasons. This was roughly {{in line with}} the national figures, except for <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> retirement. This figure nationally was significantly lower at 14%. Of the town's residents aged 16–74, 12% had a higher education qualification or the equivalent, compared with 20% nationwide.

40|$|Certain {{carnivore}} {{research projects}} and approaches depend on successful capture of individuals <b>of</b> interest. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> present at a capture site may determine {{success of a}} capture. In this study 36 lion capture cases in the Kruger National Park were used to evaluate whether <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> present at a capture site influenced lion response rates and whether <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> at a sampling site influenced {{the time it took}} to process the collected samples. The analyses suggest that when nine or fewer people were present, lions appeared faster at a call-up locality compared with when there were more than nine <b>people.</b> <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> however, did not influence the time it took to process the lions.

5|$|In many {{countries}} {{the rate of}} suicide is highest in the middle-aged or elderly. The absolute number of suicides however is greatest in those between 15 and 29 years old due to <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> this age group. In the United States it is greatest in Caucasian men older than 80 years, even though younger people more frequently attempt suicide. It {{is the second most}} common cause of death in adolescents and in young males is second only to accidental death. In young males in the developed world it is the cause of nearly 30% of mortality. In the developing world rates are similar, but it makes up a smaller proportion of overall deaths due to higher rates of death from other types of trauma. In South-East Asia in contrast to other areas of the world, deaths from suicide occur at a greater rate in young females than elderly females.|$|E
5|$|The local Norman {{population}} {{sought refuge}} in the castle {{to escape from the}} French soldiers who ravaged the town. The castle was well supplied for a siege, but the extra mouths to feed rapidly diminished the stores. Between 1,400 and 2,200 non-combatants were allowed inside, increasing <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the castle at least fivefold. In an effort to alleviate the pressure on the castle's supplies, Roger de Lacy, the castellan, evicted 500civilians; this first group was allowed to pass through the French lines unhindered, and a second group of similar size did the same a few days later. Philip was not present, and when he learned of the safe passage of the civilians, he forbade further people being allowed through the siege-lines. The idea was to keep {{as many people as possible}} within Château Gaillard to drain its resources. Roger de Lacy evicted the remaining civilians from the castle, at least 400people, and possibly as many as 1,200. The group was not allowed through, and the French opened fire on the civilians, who turned back to the castle for safety, but found the gates locked. They sought refuge at the base of the castle walls for three months; over the winter, more than half their number died from exposure and starvation. Philip arrived at Château Gaillard in February 1204, and ordered that the survivors should be fed and released. Such treatment of civilians in sieges was not uncommon, and such scenes were repeated much later at the sieges of Calais in 1346 and Rouen in 1418–1419, both in the Hundred Years' War.|$|E
