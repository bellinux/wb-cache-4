40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of deriving efficient operational rules for polling queues according to a fixed <b>time</b> <b>polling</b> scheme. A fixed <b>time</b> <b>polling</b> scheme specifies not only the visit order of the queues, but also the starting time for each visit. This problem arose from the need to efficiently collect files with call records from telecommunication switches. Using a simple approximation for the mean waiting <b>times</b> in a <b>polling</b> system with a non-cyclic visit order of the queues, we present an approach to the problem of minimizing a weighted sum of the mean waiting times at the various queues. This approach is tested via numerical experiments that are partly based on real network data...|$|R

30|$|IEEE 802.16 e [1 – 3] (also called WiMAX) is a {{combination}} of layer- 2 and layer- 1 protocols that provide fixed and mobile broadband wireless solution. WiMAX provides quality of service (QoS) by segregating user data into five different service class. The decision on the appropriate service class is made based on the quality of service requirements, like delay, jitter and throughput for the traffic. The first service class called Unsolicited Grant Services (UGS) is designed to support real time data streams that generate fixed size packets at periodic intervals. Voice over IP without silence suppression is an example for traffic that is categorized as UGS. The second service class called Real <b>Time</b> <b>Polling</b> Services (RTPS) supports real time data streams that generate variable sized packets on a periodic basis. For example, an MPEG video. The third service class also called Extended Real <b>Time</b> <b>Polling</b> Services (eRTPS) supports real-time service flows that generate variable sized data packets at periodic intervals, for example, VoIP with silence suppression. The fourth service class is called Non Real <b>Time</b> <b>Polling</b> Services (nRTPS). nRTPS supports delay-tolerant data streams that generate variable size data packets. An example for one such type of traffic is the file transfer protocol data (FTP). The last service class, also called Best Effort (BE), supports data streams which do not require any service level, for example Web browsing, Email etc.|$|R

[...] This opinion is perhaps shared by a proportion of viewers, as Pauline was voted the 35th most annoying person of 2006 in a BBC Three poll, being the only fictional character to appear on the list. In a Radio <b>Times</b> <b>poll</b> of over 5,000 people in 2004, 13% chose Pauline Fowler as the soap character they would most like to see retired.
