5|$|Bret Hart was {{scheduled}} to defend his title against Bob Backlund at Survivor Series 1994. The stipulations stated {{that the only way}} to win was to force the person in your opponent's corner <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> a towel into the ring. Davey Boy Smith was in Bret's corner, while Owen Hart was in Backlund's corner. Smith chased Owen around the ring until Smith suffered a kayfabe injury, leaving nobody <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> in Bret's towel. As Backlund performed the crossface chickenwing on Bret, Owen pretended to show remorse. He convinced his mother, Helen, <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> in Bret's towel. After Backlund was awarded the belt, Owen celebrated his success in costing Bret the title.|$|E

50|$|In baseball, {{the time}} of pitch is the instant when the pitcher has begun his {{pitching}} motion and, by the rules, has committed himself <b>to</b> <b>throwing</b> the pitch. This instant thus occurs before the pitcher releases the ball. Once a pitcher commits himself <b>to</b> <b>throwing</b> a pitch, it is illegal for {{him to return to}} his set. If that happens, he is charged with a balk, and all baserunners advance a base.|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} the relationships present between grip strength, wrist flexion, arm length, partial and total, and throwing velocity. Thirty-one subjects were tested {{to obtain the}} data on these variables. A multiple linear regression equation produced a significant F ratio {{for the relationship between}} grip strength and throwing velocity. Neither wrist flexion nor arm length obtained a significant F ratio <b>to</b> <b>throwing</b> velocity. A stepwise multiple regression equation again displayed a significant F ratio for grip strength and throwing velocity. Wrist flexion and arm length did not produce a significant F ratio for their relationships <b>to</b> <b>throwing</b> velocity. This study concludes that of the variables tested, only grip strength displayed a significant relationship <b>to</b> <b>throwing</b> velocity. This study indicates that throwing velocity can be predicted at a moderate level from the measurement of grip strength...|$|R
5|$|After enjoying life as {{a billionaire}} for a few days, Homer decides <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party. However, Moe informs Homer {{that he can not}} sell him alcohol on account of it being Sunday before 2:00 PM. After Homer is told {{the only way he could}} buy alcohol would be to sail out to {{international}} waters where there are no laws, he and his friends (including his son Bart) set sail in Burns' private yacht <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> the party there. Back at the Mayo Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases the doctors have just discovered in him. However, the sheer number of diseases prevents any one disease from actually doing harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though the doctors protest that even a slight breeze could disrupt the balance in his body.|$|E
5|$|After the match, Hulk Hogan came to ring {{to check}} on Hart's condition.

Hogan agreed and entered the ring. Fuji tried <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> salt in Hogan's eyes, but he missed and the salt hit Yokozuna. Hogan performed a leg drop and pinned Yokozuna to win the title in 22 seconds.|$|E

On 29 December 1963, the Indonesian unit attacked the 3rd Royal Malay Regiment unit. The Indonesians managed <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> several grenades into the totally unprepared Malay Regiment's sleeping quarters. The attack resulted in eight Malay soldiers being killed and nineteen wounded. Malaysian armed police eventually drove the attackers north after a two-hour battle.|$|E

5|$|Discus {{is one of}} {{the events}} where the athlete has <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> a heavy disc in the attempt to mark a farther {{distance}} than their competitors. As one of the events within the ancient pentathlon, the history of the discus throw dates back to 708 BC. In ancient times a heavy circular disc was thrown from a set standing position on a small pedestal, and it was this style that was revived for the 1896 Olympics. This continued until the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens, which featured both the ancient style and the increasingly popular modern style of turning and throwing. By the 1912 Olympics, the ancient standing throw style had fallen into disuse and contests starting within a 2.5m squared throwing area became the standard. The discus implement was standardised to 2kg (4.4pounds) in weight and 22cm (8inches) in diameter in 1907. The women's discus was among the first women's events on the Olympic programme, being introduced in 1928., although they had been competing at some national and regional levels previously.The first modern athlete <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> the discus while rotating the whole body was Czech athlete Frantisek Janda-Suk. He invented the technique when studying the position of the famous statue of Discobolus.|$|E
5|$|Former Indian player Prabhakaralso {{publicly}} {{claimed that}} Kapil wanted <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> away a match against Pakistan. Prabhakar's allegations against an unknown team member was not new {{as he made}} these allegations to a magazine The Outlook in 1997 based on which BCCI instituted the Chandrachud Inquiry, a one man commission headed by retired Chief Justice of India Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud. Prabhakar did not reveal names or provide evidence of his charges (match fixing and phone tapping allegation on then cricket manager Ajit Wadekar). When the match fixing controversy resurfaced in 2000, BCCI released the Chandrachud Report to the media. The reaction of the Indian public resulted in PILs and International Cricket Council and the BCCI were called to respond in the Delhi and Calcutta High Courts. In response to the crisis, the Indian government initiated a CBI inquiry on 28 April 2000. Former BCCI President Inderjit Singh Bindra revealed on 4 May 2000 that Prabhakar told him that Kapil asked him <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> away the match. During the ensuing exchanges between various parties, Kapil Dev broke down {{in an interview on}} BBC's Hard Talk with Karan Thapar.|$|E

5|$|Humber {{finished}} {{the game with}} nine strikeouts; the other batters were retired with five groundouts and 13 flyouts. Humber threw only 96 pitches, making this the first perfect game thrown in under 100 pitches since David Cone's perfect game on July 18, 1999. Humber had only started 29 Major League games prior <b>to</b> <b>throwing</b> his perfect game, making him the pitcher with the second fewest starts prior <b>to</b> <b>throwing</b> a perfect game, behind fellow White Sox player Charlie Robertson. MLB.com has made available the video of the last out.|$|R
5|$|However, the U.S. did {{not have}} enough troops; Cutler, whose brigade was {{deployed}} north of the Chambersburg Pike, had his right flank in the air.

5|$|Humber {{became the}} seventh {{former member of}} the Mets to go on <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> a no-hitter for another team.

5|$|If {{a runner}} {{advances}} because the defense {{does nothing to}} try to stop the advance, the scorer may rule that the advance was due to defensive indifference and no stolen base is credited. However, a throw is not required for a stolen base. If a fielder begins to visibly make an attempt to prevent an advance but then elects not <b>to</b> <b>throw,</b> the advance is not due to defensive indifference.|$|E
