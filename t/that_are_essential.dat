5|$|Certain {{bacteria}} form close spatial associations <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> {{for their}} survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids, such as butyric acid or propionic acid, and produce hydrogen, and methanogenic Archaea that consume hydrogen. The bacteria in this association {{are unable to}} consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow.|$|E
5|$|Hobgood et al. {{argue that}} one key {{component}} in equipping nations to develop emergency medical systems {{is to identify}} the aspects of training <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> for health care providers. In their view, a standard curriculum is useful for identifying core issues, even if countries have very different needs and resources. To address this goal, the International Federation for Emergency Medicine developed a model curriculum in 2009. This initiative seeks to provide a minimum basic standard that can be tailored to {{the specific needs of}} the various nations implementing training in emergency medicine. It is targeted towards all medical students in order to produce a minimum competency in emergency care for all physicians, regardless of their specialty.|$|E

5|$|SR57 {{is legally}} {{eligible}} for the State Scenic Highway System through Brea Canyon, between SR 90 and SR 60, though it has not officially been designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation.

5|$|In {{his paper}} The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories, philosopher Michael Stocker {{challenges}} Kantian ethics (and all modern ethical theories) {{by arguing that}} actions from duty lack certain moral value. He gives the example of Smith, who visits his friend in hospital out of duty, rather than because of the friendship; he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by the wrong thing. Marcia Baron has attempted to defend Kantian ethics on this point. After presenting {{a number of reasons}} that we might find acting out of duty objectionable, she argues that these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their duty is. Acting out of duty is not intrinsically wrong, but immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty-bound to do. Duty need not be seen as cold and impersonal: one may have a duty to cultivate their character or improve their personal relationships. Baron further argues that duty should be construed as a secondary motive—that is, a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done, rather than prompt specific actions. She argues that, seen this way, duty neither reveals a deficiency in one's natural inclinations to act, nor undermines the motives and feelings <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> to friendship. For Baron, being governed by duty does not mean that duty is always the primary motivation to act; rather, it entails that considerations of duty are always action-guiding. A responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions, such as questions of character. These should guide moral agents to act from duty.|$|E

25|$|Vitamin K {{has been}} found to be {{associated}} with sulfatide. Not only in animals, but also in bacteria, vitamin K has been observed to influence sulfatide concentrations in the brain. Vitamin K in the nervous system is responsible for the activation of enzymes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> for the biosynthesis of brain phospholipids, such as sulfatide. When warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is added to an animal model system, sulfatide synthesis is impaired. However, when vitamin K is added back into the system, sulfatide synthesis proceeds normally, suggesting that Vitamin K is necessary for sulfatide synthesis.|$|E

25|$|According to {{researchers}} the reward circuit is continuously involved in initiating behaviors <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> for the sustenance {{of the individual}} (such as eating) or of {{the preservation of the}} species (such as sexual reproduction). Food intake or sexual stimuli then lead to endorphine regulated release of dopamine in core substrates of the reward processing system, which subsequently activate craving sensations. The development of addictions is then directly related to the acquired or genetic abuse of the reward circuit. This finding then suggests that individuals with increased reward dependence have a relative deficit of endorphines and are possibly at higher risk for developing addictive behaviors.|$|E

25|$|Smaller {{artificial}} {{versions of}} the hairpin ribozyme {{have been developed to}} enable a more detailed experimental analysis of the molecule. This is a commonly used strategy for separating those parts of a self-processing RNA molecule <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>essential</b> for the RNA processing reactions from those parts which serve unrelated functions. Through this process, a 50 nucleotide minimal catalytic domain and a 14 nucleotide substrate were identified. Using these artificially derived sequences, a trans-acting ribozyme was developed that can catalyze the cleavage of multiple substrate molecules. This strategy was important in that it allowed investigators to (i) apply biochemical methods for enzymatic analysis, (ii) conduct experiments to identify essential structural elements of the ribozyme-substrate complex, and (iii) develop engineered ribozymes that have been used for biomedical applications, including preventing the replication of pathogenic viruses, and the study of the function of individual genes.|$|E
