40|$|Abstract- Genetic {{algorithms}} (GAs) {{and evolution}} strategies (ESs) are two widely used evolutionary algorithms. The main differences between GAs and ESs lie in their representations and variation operators, which result {{in very different}} search dynamics. In this paper, we compare <b>the</b> search <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> GAs and ESs theoretically using a theoretical framework for analyzing <b>the</b> search <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> evolution strategies proposed in this paper and a framework for genetic algorithms we suggested in [Oka 05]. Based on the theoretical analysis, interesting aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> search <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> GAs and ESs for single objective optimization are revealed. As an extension, preliminary results on <b>the</b> search <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> GAs for multi-objective optimization are also presented. ...|$|R

In the modern cosmological models, most energy in the universe is in forms that have never been detected directly, namely dark energy and dark matter.

40|$|Abstract Uncovering <b>the</b> {{evolutionary}} <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> economies {{is helpful}} {{for us to}} design economic policy. This paper develops an economic evolution model by examining <b>the</b> coupled <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> industry growth and interindustry structure. For each industry, its economic properties (mainly characterized by price and quantity) are incorporated into the model. The input–output relationships among different industries are described as input–output networks, in which nodes represent industries, and weights represent technological and economic constraints between pairing industries. By measuring the dynamic importance of each node, we find that all the nodes in the input–output networks have the same dynamic importance. On {{the basis of this}} empirical regularity and the rational expectation assumption, we show that <b>the</b> coupled <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic properties of nodes and input–output networks can explain <b>the</b> evolutionary <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> national economies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We study <b>the</b> active <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> {{single and}} {{interacting}} cytoskeletal filaments in motility assays, in which immobilized motor proteins bind the filaments to a surface and actively pull them along this surface. We present a model which couples <b>the</b> overdamped <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> filaments, <b>the</b> active <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> motor heads, and the elasticity of motor stalks and {{which can be}} used for Langevin dynamics simulations. Single filaments perform a persistent random walk, which we characterize by several simulation results. For interacting filaments with a repulsive interaction <b>of</b> filaments, <b>the</b> motor-driven <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> filaments leads to a non-equilibrium phase transition which generalizes the isotropic-nematic phase transition of the corresponding equilibrium system, the hard-rod fluid. Langevin dynamics simulations and analytical theory show that the motor activity enhances the tendency for nematic ordering. ...|$|R

Since competitive pressure was generally weak at that time, interpretations of statistical similarities as to pointing to a "firm-like behaviour" are questionable...|$|R
