5|$|After {{the death}} of Stalin in March 1953, the new {{collective}} Soviet leadership started to advocate a New Course. Moscow favored replacing East Germany's Stalinist party leader Walter Ulbricht and made inquiries about Rau as a potential candidate. In response, the leading SED party ideologist, Rudolf Herrnstadt, a candidate member of the Poliburo, with assistance from Rau drew up a concept for just such a New Course in East Germany. However, the workers' uprising, which was suppressed by the Soviet army on 17June led to a backlash. Three weeks later, during a session of the then eight person Politburo (plus six candidate members) on 8July 1953, Rau made a recommendation that Ulbricht be replaced, while Rau's Spanish Civil War comrade, Stasi chief Wilhelm Zaisser, who in Spain had been known as 'General Gómez', accused Ulbricht of having perverted the party. The majority was against Ulbricht. His only supporters were Hermann Matern and Erich Honecker. At that moment however there was no viable candidate who could replace Ulbricht immediately. Suggested were first Rudolf Herrnstadt and then Heinrich Rau, but both were hesitant, thus a decision was postponed. <b>The</b> <b>very</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> after the meeting Ulbricht went by plane to Moscow and the Soviet leadership, who in part also feared that deposing Ulbricht might be construed {{as a sign of}} weakness, now secured Ulbricht's position.

5|$|In 1769, Pulaski's {{unit was}} again besieged by numerically {{superior}} forces, {{this time in}} the old fortress of Okopy Świętej Trójcy, which has served as his base of operations since December the previous year. However, after a staunch defense, he was able to break the Russian siege. On April 7, he was made the regimentarz of the Kraków Voivodeship. In May and June he operated near Przemyśl, but failed to take the town. Criticized by some of his fellow Confederates, Pulaski departed to Lithuania with his allies and a force of about 600 men on June 3. There, Pulaski attempted to incite a larger revolt against Russia; despite no decisive military successes, he was able to assemble a 4,000-strong army and deliver it back to a Confederate staging point. This excursion received international notice and gained him a reputation as the most effective military leader in the Bar Confederation.

40|$|Background: T biomodulina is a thymic {{natural product}} with {{anti-inflammatory}} and immunomodulator action. Corticotropin is a steroid {{which is also}} used {{in the treatment of}} multiple sclerosis. Objetives: To compare the adverse effects of the biomodulina and corticotroprin in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Methods: Phase II clinical trial, open, randomized and controlled on 17 patients suffering from multiple sclerosis to whom the following treatment was applied: group one, 100 mg IV biomodulina during 10 days, 20 mg the following 20 days; group two: 1 mg of corticotroprin during 10 days followed by 0, 5 mg <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>next</b> 20 <b>days.</b> <b>The</b> adverse events were evaluated from the 10 th day up to the 30 th day classifying its intensity as absent, mild, moderate, severe, <b>very</b> severe. <b>The</b> duration and the type of event were also classified. Results: Safeness on 8 patients treated with biomodulina and 7 patients treated with cortcotropin were assessed. 40 adverse events took place: 24 patients in whose corticotropin was used, 16 in the treatment with biomodulina (80 and 53, 3 % respectively), while the moderate adverse reactions in the usage of corticotropin were more frequent. The shorter period of time of the events was produced by biomodulina. Conclusions: The usage of biomodulina was safer in the treatment of multiple sclerosis because the adverse events as well as the period of time were less intense. </strong...|$|R
60|$|On {{the first}} reading, Mr. Chamberlain astounded allies and opponents alike by {{suddenly}} revealing his view, {{that the true}} solution of the question was to be sought {{in some form of}} federation. It was upon the line of federation, and not upon the pattern of the self-governing colonies, that we should {{find a way out of}} the difficulty.(199) Men could hardly trust their ears. On the second reading, he startled us once more by declaring that he was perfectly prepared, <b>the</b> <b>very</b> (M117) <b>next</b> <b>day</b> if we pleased, to establish between this country and Ireland the relations subsisting between the provincial legislatures and the dominion parliament of Canada.(200) As to the first proposal, anybody could see that federation was a vastly more revolutionary operation than the delegation of certain legislative powers to a local parliament. Moreover before federating an Irish legislature, you must first create it. As to the second proposal, anybody could see on turning for a quarter of an hour to the Dominion Act of 1867, that in some of the particulars deemed by Mr. Chamberlain to be specially important, a provincial legislature in the Canadian system had more unfettered powers than the Irish legislature would have under the bill. Finally, he urged that inquiry into the possibility of satisfying the Irish demand should be carried on by a committee or commission representing all sections of the House.(201) In face of projects so strangely fashioned as this, Mr. Gladstone had a right to declare that just as the subject held the field in the public mind—for never before had been seen such signs of public absorption in the House and out of the House—so the ministerial plan held the field in parliament. It had many enemies, but it had not a single serious rival.|$|R

Flying {{south along the}} Adriatic, near Crete the bombers separated with Bill Katz and Ray Kurtz taking the only Fortress with an oxygen system and a proper sight to bomb the royal palace in Cairo, {{and the other two}} B-17s heading towards the REAF base at El-Arish. While Katz and Kurtz successfully bombed the Abdeen Palace, the other two failed to locate their target and bombed Rafah instead, and all landed that evening at Tel Nof. The three aircraft were back in action at 06:30 on <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> hitting the REAF base at El-Arish they had missed the previous night. As Tel-Nof was deemed vulnerable to Egyptian attacks, the aircraft then landed at Ramat David, which was to house the squadron {{for the remainder of the}} war. In following days, until a UN-brokered ceasefire came into effect on July 18, the Fortresses struck across three fronts, attacking Majdal, Damascus and Tulkarm. Raising the average bomb load of an IAF sortie from 100kg per sortie to 743kg per sortie, the B-17s are credited with propelling the Israeli Air Force into the realm of modern aerial warfare.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of Iguanodon {{has long been}} accompanied by a popular legend. The story goes that Gideon Mantell's wife, Mary Ann, discovered the first teeth of an Iguanodon in the strata of Tilgate Forest in Whitemans Green, Cuckfield, Sussex, England, in 1822 while her husband was visiting a patient. However, {{there is no evidence}} that Mantell took his wife with him while seeing patients. Furthermore, he admitted in 1851 that he himself had found the teeth. Not everyone agrees that the story is false, though. It is known from his notebooks that Mantell first acquired large fossil bones from the quarry at Whitemans Green in 1820. Because also theropod teeth were found, thus belonging to carnivores, he at first interpreted these bones, which he tried to combine into a partial skeleton, as those of a giant crocodile. In 1821 Mantell mentioned the find of herbivorous teeth and began to consider the possibility that a large herbivorous reptile was present in the strata. However, in his 1822 publication Fossils of the South Downs he as yet did not dare to suggest a connection between the teeth and his very incomplete skeleton, presuming that his finds presented two large forms, one carnivorous ("an animal of the Lizard Tribe of enormous magnitude"), the other herbivorous. In May 1822 he first presented the herbivorous teeth to the Royal Society of London but the members, among them William Buckland, dismissed them as fish teeth or the incisors of a rhinoceros from a Tertiary stratum. On 23 June 1823 Charles Lyell showed some to Georges Cuvier, during a soiree in Paris, but the famous French naturalist at once dismissed them as those of a rhinoceros. Though <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> Cuvier retracted, Lyell reported only the dismissal to Mantell, who became rather diffident about the issue. In 1824 Buckland described Megalosaurus and was on that occasion invited to visit Mantell's collection. Seeing the bones on 6 March he agreed that these were of some giant saurian— though still denying it was a herbivore. Emboldened nevertheless, Mantell again sent some teeth to Cuvier, who answered on 22 June 1824 that he had determined that they were reptilian and quite possibly belonged to a giant herbivore. In a new edition that year of his Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles Cuvier admitted his earlier mistake, leading to an immediate acceptance of Mantell, and his new saurian, in scientific circles. Mantell tried to corroborate his theory further by finding a modern-day parallel among extant reptiles. In September 1824 he visited the Royal College of Surgeons but at first failed to find comparable teeth. However, assistant-curator Samuel Stutchbury recognised that they resembled those of an iguana he had recently prepared, albeit twenty times longer.|$|E

50|$|In yogic lore, it is {{said that}} Guru Purnima was the day that saw Shiva become the Adi Guru, or the first Guru. The story goes that over 15,000 years ago, a yogi {{appeared}} in the upper regions of the Himalayas. Nobody knew what his origins were. But his presence was extraordinary, and people gathered. However, he exhibited no signs of life, but for the occasional tears of ecstasy that rolled down his face. People began to drift away, but seven men stayed on. When he opened his eyes, they pleaded with him, wanting to experience whatever was happening to him. He dismissed them, but they persevered. Finally, he gave them a simple preparatory step and closed his eyes again. The seven men began to prepare. Days rolled into weeks, weeks into months, months into years, but the yogi’s attention did not fall upon them again. After 84 years of sadhana, on the summer solstice that marks the advent of Dakshinayana, the earth’s southern run, the yogi looked at them again. They had become shining receptacles, wonderfully receptive. He could not ignore them anymore. On <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>next</b> full moon <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> yogi turned south and sat as a Guru to these seven men. Shiva, the Adiyogi (the first yogi) thus became the Adi Guru. Adiyogi expounded these mechanics of life for many years. The seven disciples became celebrated as the Saptarishis and took this knowledge across the world. Guru Purnima is held sacred in the yogic tradition because the Adiyogi opened up the possibility for a human being to evolve consciously. The seven different aspects of yoga that were put in these seven individuals became the foundation for the seven basic forms of yoga, something that has still endured.|$|R

In this paper,efforts towardsconservation of natural forests through the collective action of providing social fencing reflected in the institution of sacred groves are discussed. This pertains to the village community in the Western Ghats region of Karnataka, India, committed towards stringent conservation efforts. The rituals of annual festivity called Devatehabba, (The worshiping festival of Goddess Mother Nature) as they trust {{are a part of}} the conservation efforts binding the members of the village community together for the cause of nature conservation.

40|$|In {{the loss}} of Prof (Dr.) S. G. Mudgal, the world of {{philosophy}} has lost an eminent torch -bearer of the classical Indian tradition. His benign presence, stately bearing, and benevolent guidance to all his students and peers in the field was something to be experienced. Words are inadequate to describe such an experience. His anguish towards the neglect of the Indian tradition, and dismay at finding bright minds trying to stilt and distort the Indian philosophical corpus by viewing it through western methodology and approach was palpable. He {{was one of the}} finest of the committed proponents of that which was the best in ancient Indian thought. And he had no regrets proclaiming it. His knowledge of the classical western tradition was adequate for him to find the greatness therein, and find many comparative features, which fortified his abiding interest in the Indian one. Lately he appeared in a hurry, probably realizing the end was near. In 2003 he published his 310 page book The Bhagavad Gita (Himalaya Publishing), a seminal work on the great treatise. This book is his understanding of the Bhagavad Gita, which, according to him, is theistic and realistic:The world, according to the BG is real and not illusory, nor an illusion. The jivas are real. Bondage and attainment of Moksa are also real. Jnana and Bhakti are inclusive; ultimately it is Bhakti which leads to Mukti. Grace of Guru and God are emphasized. Bhakti continues even in the state of Moksa. The Gita does not advocate the doctrine of Karma Sanyasa; but advocates the performance of Karma as worship, as dedication and an offering to God. Work thus done with a sense of dedication or worship, is liberating and not binding. (Back cover of the book) Dr Mudgal had been a well known academician, erudite scholar, and an able and efficient administrator. He had been Principal of the well known Ruparel College, Mumbai, and Nowrojee Wadia College, Pune. He made a mark as Professor of Indian Philosophy and Comparative Religion. He studied all the schools of Indian Philosophy, especially the three schools of Vedanta, namely, Advaita, Visistadvaita and Dvaita. He had a great grasp over Mahayana Buddhism too. A life immersed in Philosophy, welfare of students and society at large, and dedicated to prayer and ethical conduct. Every student who visited him came away blessed and transformed, with a desire to do good and work for society in his own way. Never ever even a trace of conceit or greed, never a blemish in an exemplary life lived according to principles of the highest moral order. It was difficult for this goodness not to rub off on all those whose life he touched. We had numerous discussions with him for hours on end over various aspects of Philosophy. And it was a treat to listen to him expound tirelessly over a certain topic for hours, without once stopping to search for words, or even to drink a glass of water. And every time we came away feeling blessed to have met him and to work with greater dedication and commitment, irrespective of the decay of values all around. He was one of the foremost subscribers of the Mens Sana Monographs, and was always very solicitous of its welfare. We shall miss his kindly enquiries and his encouraging words. Just to think of him fills the mind with a great zest to persist on the right path regardless of consequences and oblivious of distractions. He departed from us on Indian Independence Day 2005.
