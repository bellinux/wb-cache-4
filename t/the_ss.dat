5|$|After 1933 {{a career}} in <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> became {{increasingly}} attractive to Germany's social elite, who began joining the movement in great numbers, usually motivated by political opportunism. By 1938 about one-third of <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> leadership {{were members of the}} upper middle class. The trend reversed after the first Soviet counter-offensive of 1942.|$|E

30|$|The {{standard}} defines {{two main}} request/grant mechanisms: unicast polling and contention-based polling. The unicast polling is the {{mechanism by which}} the BS allocates bandwidth to each SS to send its BW-REQ messages. The BS performs the polling periodically. After this, <b>the</b> <b>SSs</b> can send its BW-REQ messages as a standalone message {{in response to a}} poll from the BS or it can be piggybacked in data packets. The contention-based polling allows <b>the</b> <b>SSs</b> to send their bandwidth requests to the BS without being polled. <b>The</b> <b>SSs</b> send BW-REQ messages during the contention period. If multiple request messages are transmitted at the same time, collisions may be occurred. There are other mechanisms that <b>the</b> <b>SSs</b> can use to request uplink bandwidth such as multicast polling, channel quality indicator channel, etc. Depending on the QoS and traffic parameters associated with a service, {{one or more of these}} mechanisms may be used by <b>the</b> <b>SSs</b> [11]. A comparison of these mechanisms is presented in [6].|$|R

This is a practical network planning scenario as network planning always recommend maintaining at least 80 % of the population in the highest modulation scheme.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of the counterattack, Manstein could count on the Fourth Panzer Army, {{composed}} of XLVIII Panzer Corps, <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> Panzer Corps and the First Panzer Army, with the XL and LVII Panzer Corps. The XLVIII Panzer Corps was composed of the 6th, 11th and 17th Panzer Divisions, while <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> Panzer Corps was organized with the 1st SS, 2nd SS and 3rd SS Panzer Division. In early February, the combined strength of <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> Panzer Corps was an estimated 20,000 soldiers. The Fourth Panzer Army and the First Panzer Army were situated south of the Red Army's bulge into German lines, with the First Panzer Army to the east of the Fourth Panzer Army. <b>The</b> <b>SS</b> Panzer Corps was deployed along the northern edge of the bulge, on the northern front of Army Group South.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1938 and {{throughout}} World War II, <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> enacted a procedure where offices and units of <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> could form smaller sub-units, known as SS-Sonderkommandos, {{to carry out}} special tasks, including large-scale murder operations. The use of SS-Sonderkommandos was widespread. According to former SS Sturmbannführer Wilhelm Höttl, not even <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> leadership knew how many SS-Sonderkommandos were constantly being formed, disbanded, and reformed for various tasks, especially on the Eastern Front.|$|E
5|$|Between 1925 and 1929, <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> was {{considered}} to be a small Gruppe (battalion) of the SA.

As Heiden attempted to keep <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> from dissolving, Heinrich Himmler became his deputy in September 1927. Himmler displayed good organizational abilities compared to Heiden. <b>The</b> <b>SS</b> established a number of Gaus (regions or provinces).

5|$|In 1942, Himmler {{consolidated}} all of {{the offices}} for which Pohl was responsible into one, creating <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> Main Economic and Administrative Office (Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungshauptamt; WVHA).

By 1944, <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> had purchased 75 percent of the mineral water producers in Germany and were intending to acquire a monopoly. Several concentration camps produced building materials such as stone, bricks, and cement for the SS-owned Deutsche Erd- und Steinwerke (German Earth And Stone Works; DEST). In the occupied Eastern territories, <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> acquired a monopoly in brick production by seizing all 300 extant brickworks. The DWB also founded the Ost-Deutsche Baustoffwerke (East German Building Supply Works; GmbH or ODBS) and Deutsche Edelmöbel GmbH (German Noble Furniture).

In the uplink scheduling, the input queues are located in <b>the</b> <b>SSs</b> and are hence separated from the BS. So, the BS does not have any information about the arrived time of packets in <b>the</b> <b>SSs</b> queues.

5|$|In September 1939, the {{authority}} of <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> expanded further when the senior SS officer in each military district also became its chief of police. Most of these SS and police leaders held the rank of SS-Gruppenführer or above, and answered directly to Himmler in all SS matters within their district. Their role was to police the population and oversee the activities of <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> men within their district. By declaring an emergency, they could bypass the district administrative offices for <b>the</b> <b>SS,</b> SD, SiPo, SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV; concentration camp guards), and Orpo, thereby gaining direct operational control of these groups.|$|E
5|$|Initially a {{force of}} a dozen men {{under the auspices of}} the SA, the Schutzstaffel (SS) grew to become one of the largest and most {{powerful}} groups in Nazi Germany.

Himmler envisioned <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> as being an elite group of guards, Hitler's last line of defence. The Waffen-SS, the military branch of <b>the</b> <b>SS,</b> became a de facto fourth branch of the Wehrmacht.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March 1927, Joseph Berchtold {{transferred}} {{leadership of}} <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> to Heiden, {{who was his}} acting deputy. Berchtold had become disillusioned by the SA's authority over <b>the</b> <b>SS.</b> As head of <b>the</b> <b>SS,</b> Heiden also {{found it difficult to}} function under the larger and more powerful SA. Under Heiden's leadership a stricter code of discipline was enforced than would have been tolerated in the SA ranks. Heiden further demanded that the men under his command were not to be involved in party matters which were none of their concern. His intention was to create a small elite unit and obtain higher quality recruits.|$|E

5|$|Schreck, a {{founding}} member of the SA and a close confidant of Hitler, became the first SS chief in March 1925. On 15 April 1926, Joseph Berchtold succeeded him as chief of <b>the</b> <b>SS.</b> Berchtold changed the title of the office to Reichsführer-SS (Reich Leader-SS). Berchtold was considered more dynamic than his predecessor, but became increasingly frustrated by the authority the SA had over <b>the</b> <b>SS.</b> This led to him transferring leadership of <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> to his deputy, Erhard Heiden, on 1 March 1927. Under Heiden's leadership, a stricter code of discipline was enforced than would have been tolerated in the SA.|$|E
5|$|Schutzstaffel ("Protection Squadron"; SS) was a {{personal}} protection squad for Hitler created in 1925. Whereas the SA numbered in the millions, <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> started {{with less than a}} hundred men. <b>The</b> <b>SS</b> uniform included a black tie and a black cap with a Totenkopf ("death's head") skull and bones symbol on it. After March 1927, <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> had stricter entry requirements than the general SA. Although subordinate to the SA until the summer of 1934, its members behaved as though they were the Nazi Party elite. From January 1929 forward, <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> was commanded by Heinrich Himmler in his capacity as Reichsführer-SS; later in 1936, Himmler was appointed chief of all German police. Within <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> main branches of the Allgemeine SS, SS-Totenkopfverbände and Waffen-SS, there further existed sub-branches, including the RSHA (which had as departments: the SD, Gestapo and the Kripo). After the war, pursuant to the judgments rendered at the Nuremberg trials, as well as many war crimes investigations and trials conducted since then, <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> was judged to be a criminal organization and determined to be responsible for the majority of Nazi war crimes. In particular, it was the primary organisation which carried out the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|The Gestapo's {{transfer}} to Himmler was {{a prelude to}} the Night of the Long Knives, in {{which most of the}} SA leadership were arrested and subsequently executed. <b>The</b> <b>SS</b> and Gestapo carried out most of the killings. On 20 July 1934, Hitler detached <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> from the SA, which was no longer an influential force after the purge. <b>The</b> <b>SS</b> became an independent elite corps of the NSDAP, answerable only to Hitler. Himmler's title of Reichsführer-SS now became his actual rank, equivalent to the rank of field marshal in the army (his previous rank was Obergruppenführer). As Himmler's position and authority grew, so did his de facto rank.|$|E
500|$|A primary agent used in {{stifling}} {{the local}} extreme nationalist elements was <b>the</b> Germanic <b>SS,</b> which initially merely consisted of local respective {{branches of the}} Allgemeine-SS in Belgium, Netherlands and Norway.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>SS</b> {{established}} its own symbolism, rituals, customs, {{ranks and}} uniforms to set itself {{apart from other}} organizations.

In 1935, <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> combat formations adopted a service uniform in field grey for everyday wear. <b>The</b> <b>SS</b> also developed its own field uniforms, which included reversible smocks and helmet covers printed with camouflage patterns. Uniforms were manufactured in hundreds of licensed factories, with some workers being prisoners of war performing forced labor. Many were produced in concentration camps.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>SS</b> was the {{organization}} {{most responsible for}} the genocidal killing of an estimated 5.5 to 6 million Jews and millions of other victims in the Holocaust. Members of all of its branches committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during World War II (1939–45). <b>The</b> <b>SS</b> was also involved in commercial enterprises and exploited concentration camp inmates as slave labor. After Nazi Germany's defeat, <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> and the NSDAP were judged by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg to be criminal organizations. Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief, {{was found guilty of}} crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials and hanged in 1946.|$|E
5|$|A more {{upmarket}} SS, <b>the</b> <b>SS</b> V-Series {{represents the}} first time this type of naming has been applied to Holden products. The V-Series naming is reminiscent of the V-badging on selected Cadillac models, another member of the GM family. The badge design on the bootlid bears strong resemblance to the ones used by Cadillac. But whereas Cadillac uses it to signify high-performance versions of its products, Holden V-Series variants boast extra features. The V-Series variants were introduced, largely due to a fully optioned Commodore SS in the VZ range being rather successful. <b>The</b> <b>SS</b> V offers extra luxuries at a similar price point to the preceding SS. Inside, it is recognisable by the metallic look pedals and instruments matched with the exterior colour. Additionally, the entire dashboard can be optioned in a range of loud colours: bright red, orange or black. <b>The</b> <b>SS</b> V exterior is equally adventurous, exhibiting five-spoke 19-inch alloy wheels and the option of larger 20-inch wheels: the largest wheels ever fitted to a Holden car.|$|E
