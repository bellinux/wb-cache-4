5|$|Despite Margaret's {{frequent}} exasperation {{with her}} husband's antics, the series {{shows that the}} couple have a deep affection for one another. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> several times throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|There were {{considerable}} connections– political, trading, and cultural– {{between the}} Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in the burial ground found at Street House. The practice of burying people in beds {{seems to have}} been very uncommon in the north; most of the bed burials found so far have been in southern England, in Cambridgeshire, Essex, Suffolk, and Wiltshire. Several of the brooches and beads found in the graves are thought to have come from Kent and some of the jewellery and beadwork has strong parallels with finds from East Anglia. The Iron Age gold coins found in one grave came from a tribe that lived in the East Midlands, which suggests that their owner, likewise, was not local.|$|E
5|$|The {{key idea}} is that under certain {{circumstances}} where a representation has been made by a public authority to an individual who {{would be affected by}} a decision by the authority, the individual expects to be heard before the decision is made. To deny the right to be heard amounts to unfairness. The court will thus be inclined to quash a decision if there has been unfairness and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in the 1983 House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case). This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a government signals and intelligence department, who argued that they had an expectation to be consulted before the Minister took the decision to deny them the right to join trade unions. The Minister argued that it had been necessary to take that step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national security of the United Kingdom. The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment-related matters, even though it was not a rule. However, their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before a decision is taken when it is proven that this is the practice. Such a representation can {{come in the form of}} a clear and unambiguous promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the decision. Nonetheless, on the facts of the case, their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister's decision even though there was an enforceable legitimate expectation as the decision had been made on national security grounds.|$|E

50|$|Paroxetine might {{interact}} with statins resulting in increased blood glucose levels; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> {{in a small}} retrospective study and needs confirmation in a prospective study.|$|R
50|$|The LICRA keeps {{fighting}} neonazism and Holocaust denial. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> when it {{supported the}} Klarsfeld couple (Serge and Beate Klarsfeld), and during Klaus Barbie's trial in 1987.|$|R
25|$|In Discordianism, 5 {{is seen as}} a very {{important}} number. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in the Law of Fives, {{as well as in the}} Pentabarf, which contains five rules.|$|E
25|$|Egypt {{from the}} Roman perspective: The Romans view the Egyptians {{essentially}} as improper. Their passion for life is continuously viewed as irresponsible, indulgent, over-sexualised and disorderly. The Romans view Egypt as a distraction that can send {{even the best}} men off course. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in the following passage describing Antony.|$|E
25|$|Dydrogesterone is characterised by progestational and PR-mediated antiestrogenic activity. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by {{its ability}} to induce a {{secretory}} transformation in the endometrium of immature or ovariectomised animals {{after they have been}} primed with estrogens (cf. the Clauberg test). The oral progestogenic potency of dydrogesterone is 20 times higher than that of progesterone.|$|E
25|$|Reducing {{friction}} {{was one of}} {{the major}} reasons for the success of railroads compared to wagons. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> on an iron plate covered wooden tramway in 1805 at Croydon, England.|$|R
50|$|Internet Explorer was a 32-bit version 8 {{installed}} on 64-bit Windows 7 Service Pack 1. Security researcher Stephen Fewer of Harmony Security {{was successful in}} exploiting IE. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> Just as with Safari.|$|R
50|$|Kevin Richardson {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} rewarding drivers travelling at or below the posted limit with a cash lottery, funded by the fines on speeding drivers. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in Stockholm, Sweden, in November 2010.|$|R
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in Hua, a Papuan language. In Hua, {{alienable}} possession {{is marked}} by a free form pronoun as in (27a). In contrast, inalienable possession constructions use an inalienable possessor prefixed on the possessee, as in (27b). This construction has less linguistic distance between the possessor and possessee than in the alienable construction.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in {{the closing}} numbers of all four acts: as the drama escalates, Mozart eschews recitativi {{altogether}} and opts for increasingly sophisticated writing, bringing his characters on stage, revelling in a complex weave of solo and ensemble singing in multiple combinations, and climaxing in seven- and eight-voice tutti for acts 2 and 4.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the water molecule {{directly involved in the}} mechanism, a second water molecule is suggested {{to be a part of}} the MMP-3 active site. This auxiliary water molecule is thought to stabilize the gem-diolate intermediate as well as the transition states by lowering the activation energy for their formation. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in the mechanism and reaction coordinate diagram below.|$|E
30|$|It is {{well known}} that a random {{solution}} is a wide sense solution of the fixed point equation. The converse <b>is</b> not true. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in the following example given by Joshi and Bose [4].|$|R
5000|$|He was {{a member}} of the {{cultural}} society Junimea and his poetry often reflected his idealistic philosophical views. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in the tragedy Rienzi, (1868) which was inspired by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and later Lăpușneanu-vodă (1878-1879), ...|$|R
50|$|Satellite DNA adopts higher-order {{three-dimensional}} {{structures in}} eukaryotic organisms. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> {{in the land}} crab Gecarcinus lateralis, whose DNA contains 3% of a GC-rich sequence consisting of repeats of a ~2100 base pair (bp) sequence called RU.|$|R
25|$|There is much {{evidence}} that the Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley traded with the region. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by clay seals found at Ur III and in the Persian Gulf. In addition, if the land of Meluhha does indeed refer to the Indus Valley, then there are extensive trade records ranging from the Akkadian Empire until the Babylonian Dynasty I.|$|E
25|$|From two to {{four years}} of age {{children}} find themselves using symbols to represent physical models of the world around them. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> through a child's drawing of their family in which people are not drawn to scale or accurate physical traits are given. The child knows they are not accurate but {{it does not seem to}} be an issue to them.|$|E
25|$|For {{the brief}} {{period of time that}} Jadis is on Earth, she is shown to have no magical power, but to retain her phenomenal strength. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> when she battles with Metropolitan Police in London, {{wielding}} the cross-bar she wrenched from a lamp post. The same cross-bar was taken into the new world that would become Narnia, and grew into the full lamp post encountered by Lucy Pevensie many years later.|$|E
50|$|Since 2000 {{the band}} has seen an {{increase}} in playing members and improving performances. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in promotion to BYBA Division 2, winning the Division 3 finalsand the Boys' Brigade National Championships for the third time, in 2003.|$|R

2500|$|... dsRNA {{can also}} {{activate}} gene expression, a mechanism {{that has been}} termed [...] "small RNA-induced gene activation" [...] or RNAa. dsRNAs targeting gene promoters can induce potent transcriptional activation of associated genes. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in human cells using synthetic dsRNAs termed small activating RNAs (saRNAs), but has also <b>been</b> <b>demonstrated</b> for endogenous microRNA.|$|R
25|$|While {{chemical}} kinetics {{is concerned}} with the rate of a chemical reaction, thermodynamics determines the extent to which reactions occur. In a reversible reaction, chemical equilibrium is reached when the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal (the principle of detailed balance) and the concentrations of the reactants and products no longer change. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by, for example, the HaberBosch process for combining nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia. Chemical clock reactions such as the BelousovZhabotinsky reaction demonstrate that component concentrations can oscillate {{for a long time before}} finally attaining the equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|Klüft is 1.78 m (5ft 10 in) {{tall and}} weighs 65kg (140lb / 10.2 stone). Her {{physique}} is well-suited to multi-events: she {{is tall and}} lean for the running and jumping events but also powerful enough to perform well in the shot put and javelin. She has shown more natural ability in the jumping events, sprinting and hurdles, and has steadily improved in the throwing events and 800m and has now been described as having no weaknesses across the seven events. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by her finishing in the top six in all disciplines of the 2007 World Championship heptathlon.|$|E
25|$|Generally 3–4 km long, {{they use}} Conjoiner drives for propulsion, {{and are also}} coated with a thick caul of ice that protects against minor impacts at {{relativistic}} velocities and acts as armour against the attacks of other ships. The great size of the lighthuggers enables them to carry vast numbers of passengers and huge amounts of cargo. At the end of Redemption Ark <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by Ana Khouri and Triumvir Ilia Volyova as they load approximately 160,000 of the almost 200,000 inhabitants of the world Resurgam onto the Nostalgia for Infinity, which by this stage has suffered significant damage, and many sections of the ship have been rendered uninhabitable.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reasoning}} {{process has}} repeatedly {{been shown to}} create convincing post hoc justifications for behavior that are believed by people despite not actually correctly describing the reason underlying the choice. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in a classic paper by Nisbett and Wilson (1977).|$|R
25|$|Synthesis of {{arginine}} from citrulline also {{occurs at}} a low level in many other cells, and cellular capacity for arginine synthesis can be markedly increased under circumstances that increase the production of inducible NOS (iNOS). This allows citrulline, a byproduct of the NOS-catalyzed production of nitric oxide, to be recycled to arginine in a pathway known as the citrulline-NO or arginine-citrulline pathway. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by the fact that, in many cell types, NO synthesis can be supported to some extent by citrulline, and not just by by arginine. This recycling is not quantitative, however, because citrulline accumulates in NO-producing cells along with nitrate and nitrite, the stable end-products of NO breakdown.|$|E
25|$|In Christian art {{the hand}} will often {{actually}} represent {{the hand of}} God the Son, or the Logos; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> when later depictions start to substitute for the Hand a small half-length portrait of Christ as Logos in a similar circular frame. It is nearly always Christ in the East, but in the West God the Father will sometimes be shown in this way. However, in many contexts {{the person of the}} Trinity intended cannot be confirmed from the image alone, except in those images, like the Baptism of Christ, where Jesus the Incarnate Christ is also present, where the hand is clearly that of God the Father. Later Eastern Orthodox images often identify Hands as the Logos with the usual monogram used in icons.|$|E
25|$|Factor endowments also {{influenced}} political institutions. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by the plantation owning elite using {{their power to}} secure long lasting government institutions and pass legislation {{that lead to the}} persistence of inequality society. Engerman and Sokoloff found smallholder economies to be more equitable since they discouraged an elite class from forming, and distributed political power democratically to most land-owning males. These differences in political institutions were also highly influential in the development of schools, as more equitable societies demanded an educated population to make political decisions. Over time these institutional advantages had exponential effects, as colonies with educated and free populations were better suited to take advantage of technological change during the industrial revolution, granting country wide participation into the booming free-market economy.|$|E
40|$|<b>This</b> {{commitment}} <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> {{through more}} formal efforts in religious organizations {{and social and}} family service agencies on local, state, national and international levels.
