5|$|At 10:38 on {{the morning}} of 21 June, Fury detonated a ground mine off Juno Beach during a gale and the navy decided to tow her into the British Mulberry harbour at Arromanches where her damage could be evaluated. While waiting for a tugboat, she took on a 6° list to {{starboard}} from flooding. The Dutch tug Thames began towing the ship at 13:25; at 21:14, Fury accidentally collided with the stern of a freighter anchored outside the Mulberry, damaging her port side above the waterline, and the <b>towline</b> snapped at 21:49 when she struck another ship several times. She let go her anchor after drifting clear, but it almost immediately started dragging under the pressure of the wind and waves and the salvage ship Lincoln Salvor was secured alongside to steady Fury. Another tug made a <b>towline</b> fast at 22:18, but it immediately snapped when the tug began to pull forward. Lincoln Salvor had to cast off as her wooden hull was being damaged by slamming into Furys hull and six other tugboats attempted to tow the destroyer clear of the shipping in the Mulberry, but they all failed. Fury struck at least three other ships, including petrol and ammunition ships before she was driven ashore at 01:30. Her crew was able to walk to Arromanches at about 05:30 once the tide went out.|$|E
5|$|Aurora's {{passage from}} the ice towards safety proved slow and perilous. Coal {{supplies}} had to be conserved, allowing only limited use of the engines, and the improvised emergency rudder made steering difficult; the ship wallowed helplessly at times, in danger of foundering. Even after making {{contact with the outside}} world, Stenhouse was initially reluctant to seek direct assistance, fearful that a salvage claim might create further embarrassment for the expedition. However, he was obliged to request help when, as Aurora neared New Zealand in stormy weather on 31 March, it was in danger of being driven on the rocks. Two days later the tug Dunedin reached the ship and a <b>towline</b> was secured. On the following morning, 3 April 1916, Aurora was brought into the harbour at Port Chalmers.|$|E
5|$|Captain Pulteney Malcolm on Donegal {{attacked}} Brave directly, firing his starboard {{guns and}} then crossing Braves stern, inflicting severe damage with a raking broadside, before pulling alongside again and engaging from close range. Badly damaged, Brave surrendered. Malcolm then ordered Captain Richard Dunn in Acasta to take possession as Donegal moved forward to engage Jupiter. With Donegal alongside Jupiter, Captain Samuel Pym in Atlas abandoned his brief {{engagement with the}} French ship and steered for the melee surrounding the increasingly isolated Impérial. Taking advantage of his ship's superior speed, Malcolm pulled ahead of Jupiter and then rammed her bow, securing the ships together to prevent the French vessel from escaping. Recognising that further resistance was hopeless, Captain Gaspard Laignel surrendered immediately. Malcolm then sent 100 men on board as a prize crew and attached a <b>towline</b> to the French ship, just as the trailing Agamemnon finally reached the battle.|$|E

Large waves were splashing over and completely covering the deck and pilot house so the crew temporarily rigged the wheel atop the turret which was manned by helmsman Francis Butts. Water continued flooding into the vents and ports and the ship began rolling uncontrollably in the high seas. Sometimes she would drop into a wave with such force the entire hull would tremble.

Right when the Worthington pump could no longer keep pace with the flooding a call came from the engine room that water was gaining there. Realizing the ship was in serious trouble, Bankhead signaled Rhode Island for help and hoisted the red lantern next to Monitors white running light atop the turret. He then ordered the anchor dropped to stop the ship's rolling and pitching with little effect making it no easier for the rescue boats to get close enough to receive her crew.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Recent {{emphasis}} on linkages between essential fish habitat and fish stock productivity has {{raised concerns about}} the management of fishing activities such as trawling, which {{have the potential to}} impact fish habitat. Knowing specifically where and how intensively trawl effort has occurred over time provides ecologists with the necessary background for habitat impact and recovery studies, and provides fishery managers with an assessment of how habitat conservation objectives are being met. The objectives of this study were to (1) examine {{the extent to which the}} 2000 Pacific Fishery Management Council footrope restriction has shifted and reduced trawl fishing effort on Oregon fishing grounds, (2) to relate these changes in distribution to the benthic habitat type over which they occur, and (3) to develop methods for enhancing fine-scale spatial review of targeted fishing effort. Density analysis of available trawl start locations provided a spatial and temporal understanding of how fishing efforts increased and decreased in relation to habitat distribution and fishery management actions between 1995 and 2002. Trawl effort patterns exhibit significant inter-annual variability and patchy distribution. Areas of increased fishing effort were still evident between years, despite an overall decline in trawl tows across the time scale of this study. Tow end point locations for the years 1998 - 2001 were retrieved from manual logbooks for five reference sites located in the proximity of rock habitat features.

5000|$|The Mississippi, as I before wrote you, is conquered. Fulton in {{a letter}} to Joel Barlow During the decades {{preceding}} the first voyage of the New Orleans, and at an accelerated rate after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, settlers arrived in the western lands via the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. However, with no practical way to go upstream, trade was limited. To move upstream, one needed to either row laboriously at low speeds, push a boat with poles, or be pulled by men walking on shore with <b>towlines.</b> [...] Otherwise, the return trip required a sea voyage from New Orleans to an eastern port and crossing the Appalachian Mountains to reach an inland departure point. The New Orleans, which achieved a downstream speed of eight to ten miles per hour and an upstream speed of three miles per hour, became the first of thousands of steamboats that converted river commerce from a one-way trip downstream to two-way traffic, opening the Mississippi River and Ohio River valleys to commercial trade. In its first year of business on the Mississippi River, between New Orleans and Natchez, the New Orleans averaged $2,400 in receipts per trip, making the round trip about once every three weeks. Factoring in expenses, this amounted to a net gain of upwards of at least $20,000, which Cramer described as [...] "a revenue superior to any other establishment in the United States." [...] However, the public doubted that steam navigation could succeed, and it was still more expensive than other methods of river transport. As a result, carrying of freight on flatboats and keels actually increased. In addition, the riverbed was dotted with dangerous snags, gravel, and sandbars, and the [...] "Falls of the Ohio" [...] at Louisville effectively cut navigation into two sections. Eventually, the riverbed was cleared, and later the Louisville and Portland Canal was built, making it easier to travel the 981-mile passage between Pittsburgh and the junction with the Mississippi River.|$|R

500|$|On 17 May Terpsichore {{captured}} the privateer La Pierre off Cape Sicié, {{and from the}} crew Nelson learned that Bonaparte's departure was imminent, although the destination was still unknown. On 21 May, as his squadron reached the Îles d'Hyères near Toulon, they were struck by strong winds that snapped Vanguards topmasts and brought the wreckage down onto the deck, killing two men. Vanguard was left struggling in heavy seas, blown [...] southwards in one night. So severe was the damage that Vanguard was almost wrecked on the Corsican coast {{on the following day}} and Nelson even ordered Captain Ball, who had managed to attach a <b>towline</b> to the flagship, to abandon him. Ball refused the order and the British ships of the line rode out the storm together. Although Alexander was able to tow Vanguard to San Pietro Island off Sardinia for repairs, the gale had forced the squadron's frigates to separate from the larger ships.|$|E
