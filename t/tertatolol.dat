40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>tertatolol,</b> {{a new and}} {{powerful}} beta adrenoceptor blocking drug, on post- and prejunctional beta receptors were investigated; canine vascular tissues (saphenous veins, coronary arteries and splenic arteries) and guinea-pig trachea and atria were used. At concentrations below 10 (- 5) M, <b>tertatolol</b> did not alter basal tension or contractile responses to electrical stimulation, norepinephrine, K+ or prostaglandin F 2 alpha; at doses at or above 10 (- 5) M the drug-evoked contractions which were reduced by phentolamine and were absent in denervated veins. <b>Tertatolol</b> at 10 (- 5) M and 3 X 10 (- 5) M augmented the basal efflux of [3 H] norepinephrine in saphenous veins labeled with the 3 H-transmitter. In veins, 10 (- 5) M of <b>tertatolol</b> depressed the contractions caused by electrical stimulation without affecting those to exogenous norepinephrine; this concentration of the drug also inhibited the stimulation-induced overflow of [3 H]norepinephrine. The {{major part of the}} present study was designed to test the beta receptor blocking properties of <b>tertatolol</b> and to compare its effects with those of propranolol. <b>Tertatolol</b> inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, the relaxations caused by isoproterenol in saphenous veins, splenic arteries and coronary arteries and the relaxations evoked by norepinephrine and epinephrine in coronary arteries; the potency of <b>tertatolol</b> was higher than that of propranolol.

40|$|<b>Tertatolol</b> is {{a potent}} {{beta-blocker}} with no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) or beta 1 /beta 2 receptor subtype selectivity. We provide evidence that <b>tertatolol</b> competitively inhibits beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) and induces a marked and persistent reduction of their number. This has been consistently found in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro study showed that the receptor reduction by <b>tertatolol</b> was rapid (about 1 h at 37 degrees C), slowly reversible and independent of ISA. This effect was also observed in vivo. In healthy volunteers, seven days <b>tertatolol</b> treatment lowered the number of beta-AR by 26 %. This number gradually rose back to the pretreatment levels, and a significant effect was still present on day 3 after drug withdrawal. The reduction of heart rate by <b>tertatolol</b> was also persistent and was still significant on day 3 to 5 after drug withdrawal.

The aims of the present study were (1) to document the central and renal hemodynamic effects of <b>tertatolol</b> in normal subjects and (2) to look for a possible interaction between <b>tertatolol</b> and products of the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism. Five mg of <b>tertatolol,</b> 1 g aspirin, 5 mg <b>tertatolol</b> together with 1 g aspirin, and placebo were administered to 8 healthy volunteers at 1 week intervals in a random order and in a double-blind fashion. Cardiac output was measured by cardiac Doppler echography and renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate by constant infusion techniques using I 123 -iodohippurate and Cr 51 -EDTA respectively. Measurements were performed before and then successively 2 and 4 h after oral intake of drugs or placebo. <b>Tertatolol</b> alone or with aspirin significantly decreased heart rate and cardiac output (P less than. 05) without change in blood pressure, renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate. The renal fraction of cardiac output was increased by <b>tertatolol</b> alone or with aspirin (P less than. 05). Either placebo or aspirin alone had no effect. Thus <b>tertatolol</b> redistributes cardiac output to the kidneys in normal subjects as previously reported in hypertensive patients.

The (–) stereoisomer (Ki = 18 nM) was about 50 -fold more potent than the (+) stereoisomer (Ki = 864 nM) to inhibit the specific binding of [3 H]- 8 -OHDPAT. As expected of a 5 -HT 1 A antagonist, (–) <b>tertatolol</b> prevented in a concentration-dependent manner (Ki = 24 nM) the inhibitory effect of 8 -OH-DPAT on forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in rat hippocampal homogenates. Furthermore in vivo pretreatment with (–) <b>tertatolol</b> (5 mg/kg s. c.) significantly reduced the inhibitory influence of 8 -OH-DPAT (0. 3 mg/ kg s. c.) on the accumulation of 5 -hydroxytryptophan in various brain areas after the blockade of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase by NSD- 1015 (100 mg/kg i. p.).

Lipid mobilization was determined using local microdialysis during exercise. Subjects performed 35 -min exercise bouts at 60 % of their maximal oxygen consumption under placebo or after oral <b>tertatolol</b> [a beta-adrenergic receptor (AR) antagonist]. Under placebo, exercise increased dialysate glycerol concentration (DGC) in both groups. Phentolamine (alpha-AR antagonist) potentiated exercise-induced lipolysis in overweight but not in lean subjects; the alpha(2) -antilipolytic effect was only functional in overweight men. After <b>tertatolol</b> administration, the DGC increased similarly during exercise no matter which was used probe in both groups. Compared with the control probe under placebo, lipolysis was reduced in lean but not in overweight men treated with the beta-AR blocker. <b>Tertatolol</b> reduced plasma nonesterified fatty acids and insulin concentration in both groups at rest. Under placebo or <b>tertatolol,</b> the exercise-induced changes in plasma nonesterified fatty acids, glycerol, and insulin concentrations were similar in both groups.

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{reported that a}} potent new beta-blocker, <b>tertatolol,</b> when given at therapeutic doses to healthy volunteers, rapidly {{reduced the number of}} human mononuclear leukocyte beta-receptors. In the present study, the mechanism of receptor regulation by beta-antagonists incubated with target cells in vitro was investigated. Two different cell types (human mononuclear leukocytes and S 49 murine lymphoma cells) were used, and beta-adrenergic receptors were measured using either the hydrophilic ligand 3 H-CGP 12177 (specific for surface receptors) or lipophilic 125 I-pindolol (which measures total receptors). In a comparison between beta-blockers, <b>tertatolol</b> and bopindolol, but not propranolol and pindolol, were found to rapidly (1 hour at 37 degrees C) reduce the number of beta-adrenergic receptors. This was paralleled by a reduction in isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. The reduction in receptors was the same whether surface or total receptors were measured; thus, it was not due to receptor sequestration. This effect was not caused by partial agonist activity (bopindolol is a weak partial agonist); in parallel experiments, <b>tertatolol</b> and bopindolol, but not pindolol (potent partial agonist) and isoproterenol (full agonist), reduced beta-adrenergic receptors. Finally, this effect was not due to irreversible binding: the receptor reduction induced by the irreversible blocker bromo-acetyl-alprenolol-methane (BAAM) was stable for several hours, while the effect of <b>tertatolol</b> and bopindolol was slowly reversed over the same time course. We suggest that <b>tertatolol</b> and bopindolol have two effects on beta-adrenergic receptors: they bind competitively, and then they modify the receptors so that they are no longer available for binding by ligands or catecholamines...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tertatolol</b> is {{a potent}} new {{beta-blocker}} with no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity or beta 1 /beta 2 -receptor subtype selectivity. When given at therapeutic doses (5 mg/day) to human subjects it induced {{a reduction in the}} beta-adrenergic receptor number measured by 3 H-CGP 12177 specific binding, without any change in the affinity on intact lymphocytes. This reduction was seen 7 hours (54 %), 24 hours (35 %), and 48 hours (30 %) after a single drug dose. A similar receptor reduction was observed 7 hours (42 %), 24 hours (37 %), and 48 hours (15 %) after 14 doses of the drug. In parallel, the pharmacologic efficacy of the drug was evident from the reduction in supine and upright heart rates and after submaximal exercise; heart rate was reduced to the same extent after single or repeated drug doses. The reduction of receptor number correlated well with the reduction in heart rate in the supine (P less than 0. 001) and upright (P less than 0. 01) positions and after exercise (P less than 0. 02). In in vitro competitive binding experiments <b>tertatolol</b> was found to be a competitive inhibitor of beta-adrenergic receptors.

40|$|A novel {{strategy}} {{for improving the}} treatment of depressive illness is augmentation of antidepressants with a 5 -HT 1 (1 A) autoreceptor antagonist. However, trials using the 5 -HT 1 (1 A) /beta-blocker pindolol are proving inconsistent.

While many studies have been performed {{in order to develop}} beta(3) -adrenergic agonists as a novel strategy in the management of obesity, more information is needed about the mechanisms involved in thermogenesis and the actions of these drugs on adipocyte differentiation. To address this, the possible thermogenic and antiadipogenic properties of <b>Tertatolol,</b> a beta(3) -adrenergic agonist, in a diet-induced obesity model has been tested. Animals fed on a high-fat diet gained more weight and fat mass as compared with control and high-fat fed animals treated with <b>Tertatolol.</b> A RT-PCR was carried out in white adipose tissue specific genes involved in thermogenesis such as uncoupling proteins (UCPs) and adipogenesis such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARgamma 2), retinoid receptors (RXRalpha/RARalpha), and fatty acid binding protein (aP 2). Levels of UCP 1 mRNA were augmented in the Tertatolol-treated group as compared to non-treated high-fat fed animals, while the beta(3) -adrenergic agonist treatment significantly decreased the expression levels of aP 2 and transcription factors such as PPARgamma 2 and the ratio RXRalpha/RARalpha as compared to obese rats. Altogether these data suggest that the antiobesity effects of beta(3) -adrenergic agonists are not limited to the promotion of thermogenesis and/or lipolysis and support the implication that these beta(3) -adrenergic agonists also affect fat deposition by impairing adipogenesis in white adipose tissue (WAT) ...|$|E

It includes an overview on various chiral separation principles on chiral stationary phases with emphasis on macrocyclic antibiotic and polysaccharide chiral phases. Also chiral additives and indirect separation. Moreover, it involves an overview on the chiral separations of beta-blocker drugs and its significance. Part II: In this part, a sensitive and selective chiral HPLC method for separation and determination of pindolol enantiomers in rat plasma and in pharmaceutical formulations has been developed. The method was based on the resolution of pindolol enantiomers on Chiralpak (IB) chiral stationary phase and mobile phase composed of n-hexane: isopropanol: triethylamine (٥٠: ٥٠: ٠٫٥, v/v/v) with a flow rate of ١٫٠ ml/min and FL detection at ٢٦٦ nm for excitation and ٣٠٨ nm for emission. The method was linear in the range of ٢-٢٠٠ ng/ml in standard solution. The mean RSD of the results of within and intra-day precision and accuracy of the drug were ≤ ٦ %. The method was highly specific, where the coformulated compounds did not interfere. Part III: In this part, an enantioselective stability-indicating HPLC method was developed for the analysis of donepezil, in pharmaceutical formulations. The degradation behavior of donepezil was investigated under different stress conditions recommended by International Conference of Harmonization's (ICH). Resolution of the drug and complete separation from its degradation products are successfully achieved on Chiralcel-OJ-H column, mobile phase composed of ethanol: n-hexane: triethylamine, ٢٠:٨٠ :٠٫٣٠, (v/v/v), a flow rate of ١ ml/min and UV detector set at ٢٦٨ nm. The drug was found to degrade in alkaline, acidic, oxidative conditions and when exposed to heat. The drug was stable to sunlight.

The condition affording the best resolution has been investigated by selection and variation of the mobile-phase compositions with a flow rate of ١٫٠ ml/min and UV detector set at ٢٥٠ nm for indenolol and ٢٣٠ nm for labetalol and nadolol. The compounds investigated (labetalol, indenolol and nadolol) showed baseline and/or partial separation on either Chirobiotic T or V, columns.

The degradation behavior of propranolol was investigated under different stress conditions recommended by International conference of Harmonization's (ICH). Resolution of propranolol enantiomers from its degradation products are successfully achieved on cellulose tris(3, 5 -dimethylphenylcarbamate) CSP known as Chiralpak IB column.

40|$|PhDThe {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with developing optimization methods for chiral and achiral resolution and quantitation of some chiral beta blocker compounds namely <b>tertatolol,</b> bopindolol, and some fixed drug combinations (amlodipine, atorvastatin, rosiglotazone and glimepiride) using capillary electrophoresis technique. The principles of the proposed procedures {{as well as the}} experimental parameters were studied, discussed, explained and the data obtained were statistically analyzed. The developed methods were applied for determination of these drugs in human plasma and in pharmaceutical products. In addition we applied different computerized methods as molecular modeling, multiple-objective optimization strategy and experimental design to conform, explain the experimental results and shortening the time of experiments. The thesis is divided into six main parts. Part I This part presents general introduction about capillary electrophoresis technique and its advantages in different modes of separation, efficiency, speed of resolution, minimal consumption of sample and repeated injections of a small volume. It includes an overview on principle of this technique involves electroosmotic mobility, electrophoretic mobility and migrations. Moreover, it involves an overview on the enantioseparations with different chiral selectors with emphasis on mechanisms for the enantioresolution with cyclodextrin. Part II This part presents general information about the studied pharmaceutical compounds of various classes including antihypertensive drugs (<b>tertatolol,</b> bopindolol and amlodipine), antidiabetic drugs (rosiglotazone and glimepiride) anticholesterol drugs (atorvastatin). It includes overview on chemical formula, pharmacological actions, clinical uses and its significance. Part III In this part, a sensitive and selective capillary electrophoresis method for separation and determination of <b>tertatolol</b> enantiomers in human plasma and pharmaceutical formulations has been developed. Enantiomeric resolution was achieved by using 5 % highly sulphated gama cyclodextran, (HS--CD) in 25 mM triethylammonium phosphate (pH 2. 5) with UV detection set at 200 nm. A 22 cm effective length uncoated fused-silica capillary at a constant voltage 7 kV was used at 20 ˚C. Moreover, molecular dynamic docking simulations for four tertatolol-HS [...] CD complexes on the level of molecular mechanics and calculations of interaction energies were performed. Part IV In this part, a stereoselective capillary electrophoresis method for analysis of bopindolol enantiomers in human plasma and dosage forms has been developed. Enantiomeric resolution was achieved with 10 mM carboxy methyl β-cyclodextrin (CM-β-CD) in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 2. 5) with UV detection set at 210 nm. A 50 cm uncoated fused silica capillary at constant voltage 20 kV was used at 20 ˚C. The method was linear in the range of 125 - 5000 ng/ ml (r = 0. 999) for each enantiomer with detection limit 50 ng/ml. The computational calculations for the inclusion complexes of the S-(-) and R-(+) -bopindolol-CM [...] CD were studied. The method was superior to all the previously reported chiral methods for determination of bopindolol in terms of its simplicity and sensitivity. Part V In this part, a simple, accurate, precise, and sensitive capillary electrophoresis technique coupled to a diode array detector (DAD) has been developed for the separation and simultaneous determination of amlodipine (AM) and atorvastatin (AT) from their combination formulations. The proposed method utilized fused silica capillary (50 cm x 75 mm ID) and background electrolyte (BGE) composed of phosphate buffer (25 mM, pH 6. 5) -methanol, (80 : 20, v/v). The separation was achieved at 15 KV applied voltage and 25 0 C. The two drugs were subjected to thermal, photolytic, hydrolytic, and oxidative stress conditions and the stressed samples were analyzed by the proposed method. The method has shown adequate separation for AM and AT from their main degradation products (UK- 55 - 410) & (PD 0162910 - 00), respectively, which demonstrated the specificity of the assay. The method was linear over the range of 1 – 50 mg/ml (r = 0. 9998) for both drugs. Intra- and inter-day RSD (n = 6) was ≤ 2. 2 %. Degradation products produced as a result of stress studies did not interfere with the detection of AM and AT and the assay can thus be considered stability indicating. Part VI In this part, capillary electrophoresis method for the simultaneous determination of rosiglitazone (RSG) and glimepiride (GLIM) in human plasma and pharmaceutical formulations has been developed and optimized by utilizing multiple response simultaneous optimization using the derringer`s desirability function. The separation was carried out by using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) with an uncoated silica capillary column and detected at 214 nm. The optimum assay conditions were: 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7 and voltage = 15. 4 kV at 34, 57 ˚C. The method showed good agreement between the experimental data and predictive value throughout the studied parameter space. The described method was linear over the range of 0. 05 - 16 μg/ ml (r = 0. 9993) for RSG and 0. 20 - 16 μg/ ml (0. 9998) for GLIM. Intra- and inter-day RSD (n = 6) was ≤ 2. 5 %. In all parts, the results obtained were statistically analyzed. The thesis includes a list of 283 original references, 25 tables, 44 figures and ends with a summary in Arabic...|$|E
40|$|Hypertrophy in {{response}} to increasing blood pressure in primary hypertension leads to important functional consequences for the left ventricle. In fact, the progression of hypertensive heart disease, from an adaptive left ventricular hypertrophy with compensated ventricular function to severe hypertrophy with left ventricular failure, has been long thought {{to be related to}} the severity and duration of hypertension. Antihypertensive treatment seems to prevent or minimize the occurrence of left ventricular hypertrophy, but questions arise as to whether this therapy is also able to restore normal hemodynamic conditions, or at least to minimize the hemodynamic abnormalities. This review aims at summarizing current knowledge on the effects of the antihypertensive treatment with beta-blockers, including <b>tertatolol,</b> on hypertension-induced left ventricular hypertrophy. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular changes associated with hypertension are discussed. A decrease in left ventricular wall thickness as well as in left ventricular mass has been reported in most of the studies performed with different types of beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The extent of this reduction seems to be related not only to the fall in systemic blood pressure, but also to a decrease in sympathetic stimulation. With regard to the functional consequences of hypertension, the reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy following antihypertensive treatment with beta-blockers is usually associated with an improvement in left ventricular performance. This phenomenon can hardly be ascribed to the direct effects of beta-blocking agents. It is more likely {{to be related to the}} concomitant reduction in the afterload and to the improved left ventricular compliance, associated with a decrease in left ventricular wall thickness...|$|E
40|$|Functional and {{molecular}} approaches {{were used to}} characterize the β-AR subtypes mediating relaxation of rat ileal smooth muscle. In functional studies, (−) -isoprenaline relaxation was unchanged by CGP 20712 A (β 1 -AR antagonist) or ICI 118551 (β 2 -AR antagonist) but shifted by propranolol (pKB= 6. 69). (±) -Cyanopindolol, CGP 12177 and ICID 7114 did not cause relaxation but antagonized (−) -isoprenaline relaxation. BRL 37344 (β 3 -AR agonist) caused biphasic relaxation. The high affinity component was shifted with low affinity by propranolol, (±) -cyanopindolol, <b>tertatolol</b> and alprenolol. CL 316243 (β 3 -AR agonist) relaxation was unaffected by CGP 20712 A or ICI 118551 but blocked by SR 58894 A (β 3 -AR antagonist; pA 2 = 7. 80). Enhanced relaxation after exposure to forskolin and pertussis toxin showed that β 3 -AR relaxation can be altered by manipulation of components of the adenylate cyclase signalling pathway. The β 1 -AR agonist RO 363 relaxed the ileum (pEC 50 = 6. 18) and was blocked by CGP 20712 A. Relaxation by the β 2 -AR agonist zinterol (pEC 50 = 5. 71) was blocked by SR 58894 A but not by ICI 118551. In rat ileum, β 1 -, β 2 - and β 3 -AR mRNA was detected. Comparison of tissues showed that β 3 -AR mRNA expression was greatest in WAT>colon=ileum>cerebral cortex>soleus; β 1 -AR mRNA was most abundant in cerebral cortex>WAT>ileum=colon>soleus; β 2 -AR mRNA was expressed in soleus>WAT>ileum=colon>cerebral cortex. These results show that β 3 -ARs are the predominant β-AR subtype mediating rat ileal relaxation while β 1 -ARs may produce a small relaxation. The β 2 -AR agonist zinterol produces relaxation through β 3 -ARs {{and there was no}} evidence for the involvement of β 2 -ARs in relaxation despite the detection of β 2 -AR mRNA...|$|E
