Needle receiving tubes are not used in the freehand piercing method.|$|E
5|$|The linear {{component}} is active when <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> pressure exceeds ambient pressure by a given amount specific to <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> compartment. When <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> pressure drops below this cross-over criterion <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> is modelled by exponential kinetics.

This results in a model with the desired asymmetrical characteristics of slower washout than uptake.|$|E

5|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a medical}} imaging technique using low-coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig.22, {{the core of a}} typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> sample is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of <b>the</b> <b>tissue</b> can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{metabolic}} changes in <b>the</b> rabbit kidney <b>tissues</b> cultured with vaccinia virus, as biochemically examined. The following results were obtained. 1. During {{the course of}} the cultures, both nucleic acids in <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> were observed to decrease rapidly regardless of the presence or the absence of the virus, however, when turnover rate of the nucleic acids was determined using inorganic radio-phosphate as tracer, the rate was far higher in <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> cultured with <b>the</b> virus than those cultured without the virus. These results are considered to suggest that assimilation and dissimilation of nucleic acids is brought about in a rapid pace as compared with that in non-infected controls. 2. Almost no difference was observed in the rate of endogenous respiration and of anaerobic glycolysis, in cytochrome oxydase activity and in succinoxydase activity, between <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> cultured with <b>the</b> virus and <b>the</b> control <b>tissues.</b> However, it was remained to be examined by what kind of energy-producing system the virus multiplies in the host cells in this case. 3.

40|$|Abstract:- Theoretical {{investigation}} of the thermal heat transfer associated with <b>the</b> biological <b>tissues</b> is important for understanding the deviation of the experimental results from the theoretical analysis. In the present work, an analytical modeling of finding the temperature distribution inside <b>the</b> biological <b>tissues</b> due to <b>the</b> flow of blood is done. <b>The</b> <b>tissues</b> are approximated as a single body using the continuum approach with one side extending to infinity. Due to flow {{of blood on the}} remaining two sides there is a convective heat transfer associated with the walls of <b>the</b> <b>tissues.</b> Volumetric heating due to the metabolic processes is considered and integral energy equation is used as the governing equation. Appropriate boundary conditions are used to find the steady state temperature profile inside <b>the</b> biological <b>tissues.</b> <b>The</b> second order temperature profile, thus obtained, is substituted in the integral equation and the final transient state temperature distribution is evaluated on solving the integral equation. The final temperature distribution shows the transient response of <b>the</b> <b>tissues</b> due to blood flow and has the exponential dependence on the time involved...|$|R
