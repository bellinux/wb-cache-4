5|$|On 1November1975, Lockheed and Northrop {{were each}} awarded $1.5-million {{contracts}} {{to proceed with}} Phase 1 of XST. During a four-month period, the two companies were each required to construct full-scale wooden mock-ups, which would then be evaluated at the USAF's Radar Target Scatter (RATSCAT) test facility at White Sands, New Mexico. To test the design's radar returns, Lockheed erected a $187,000 specially built pole upon which the model would be perched. In March1976, a Lockheed model {{was transferred to the}} range before being tested; the following month Lockheed was pronounced the winner because the Northrop XST had a much higher side hemisphere RCS. DARPA, having realized the progress accumulated <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> urged the Northrop team to remain together. The agency would later initiate the Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft-Experimental (BSAX), which evolved into the Tacit Blue and, ultimately, the B-2 bomber.|$|E

25|$|Large-scale {{long-term}} {{studies of}} psychiatric effects on AAS users are not currently available. In 2003, the first naturalistic long-term study on ten users, seven of which having completed the study, found a {{high incidence of}} mood disorders and substance abuse, but few clinically relevant changes in physiological parameters or laboratory measures were noted <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> and these changes were not clearly related to periods of reported AAS use. A 13-month study, which was published in 2006 and which involved 320 body builders and athletes suggests that the wide range of psychiatric side-effects induced by the use of AAS is correlated to the severity of abuse.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Griffiths {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{the results of}} further studies designed {{to learn more about}} the optimum psilocybin doses needed for positive life-changing experiences, while minimizing the chance of negative reactions. In a 14-month followup, the researchers found that 94% of the volunteers rated their experiences with the drug as one of the top five most spiritually significant of their lives (44% said it was the single most significant). None of the 90 sessions that took place <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> were rated as decreasing well-being or life satisfaction. Moreover, 89% reported positive changes in their behaviors as a result of the experiences. The conditions of the experimental design included a single drug experience a month, on a couch, in a living-room-like setting, with eye shades and carefully chosen music (classical and world music). As an additional precaution to guide the experience, as with the 2006 study, the 2011 study included a [...] "monitor" [...] or [...] "guide" [...] whom the volunteers supposedly trusted. The monitors provided gentle reassurance when the volunteers experienced anxiety. The volunteers and monitors all remained blind to the exact dosages for the purpose of the experiment.|$|E

Basing their model on the ideas of the Russian educational theorist Lev Vygotsky, Pearson and Gallagher envisioned instruction that moved from explicit modeling and instruction to guided practice and then to activities that incrementally positioned students into becoming independent learners.

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2013, the Black Creek Business Association {{partnered with}} a UW-Madison student to conduct a {{community}} needs assessment. A survey of residents showed that what most wanted {{was a sense of}} community, with an atmosphere of a small town and an emphasis on [...] "ma and pa" [...] shops. Residents expressed an interest in an increase in food choices, the addition of flower planters and trees, making village streets more biker friendly, more parking areas, and slowing traffic on Main Street. Additionally, a desire from residents to restore and preserve historic buildings is also present <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> It was suggested that the community utilize an empty lot adjacent to the state trail for a new community center that would host indoor and outdoor events. In addition to this, a new Veterans park, extended trail systems, and the addition of decorative lighting would be added to the downtown area. Together, with a UW-Extension consultant, the board devised an eight-step plan for recruiting new businesses.|$|E
2500|$|Bisexuality as a {{transitional}} identity {{has also been}} examined. In a longitudinal study about sexual identity development among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youths, Rosario et al. [...] "found evidence of both considerable consistency and change in LGB sexual identity over time". Youths who had identified as both gay/lesbian and bisexual prior to baseline were approximately {{three times more likely}} to identify as gay/lesbian than as bisexual at subsequent assessments. Of youths who had identified only as bisexual at earlier assessments, 60 to 70 percent continued to thus identify, while approximately 30 to 40 percent assumed a gay/lesbian identity over time. Rosario et al. suggested that [...] "although there were youths who consistently self-identified as bisexual <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> for other youths, a bisexual identity served as {{a transitional}} identity to a subsequent gay/lesbian identity." [...] By contrast, a longitudinal study by Lisa M. Diamond, which followed women identifying as lesbian, bisexual, or unlabeled, found that [...] "more women adopted bisexual/unlabeled identities than relinquished these identities," [...] over a ten-year period. The study also found that [...] "bisexual/unlabeled women had stable overall distributions of same-sex/other-sex attractions." [...] Diamond has also studied male bisexuality, noting that survey research found [...] "almost as many men transitioned at some point from a gay identity to a bisexual, queer or unlabeled one, as did from a bisexual identity to a gay identity." ...|$|E

50|$|A study {{conducted}} in the North Sea between 1958-2005, collected samples of meroplankton using a CPR survey. These samples consisted of larval echinoderms, decapods, bivalves, cirripedes, and ectoprocts. Meroplankton abundance as well as PCI levels (amount of chlorophyll in each sample in relation to sea surface temperature) were examined. Researchers concluded that echinoderm larvae increased in abundance <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> with the largest increase occurring in the Northern and Central regions. Decapod larvae were found to increase in abundance as well, and were found to appear earlier in the year. Bivalve larvae showed an overall decline in abundance. It was also concluded that PCI levels increased <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> particularly during the summer months. It was determined that climate, particularly sea surface temperature, drives meroplankton abundance. Warmer sea surface temperature shortens developmental time of the larvae, increasing their survival rate.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ecological {{investigation}} of two riverine wetlands of Goalpara district, Assam, India {{was carried out}} in relation to planktonic productivity from 2006 to 2008.

Both the beel was dominated by Chlorophyceae <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> year amongst which Ulothrix and Spirogyra were found as dominating species. Among the Copepods, Cyclops was over all dominating species and amongst the Cladoceran groups; Daphnia, Bosmina and Moina were found in <b>the</b> wetlands <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>studied</b> period. Phytoplankton community of Urpod beel constituted 58. 82 % to 65. 52 %, while zooplankton community constituted 34. 48 % to 41. 18 % of the total plankton hauled <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>studied</b> period.
