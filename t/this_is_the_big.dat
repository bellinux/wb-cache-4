The area is rich in history, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Muddy Badlands area which featured the hideouts of outlaws and rum runners of the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} century. [...] This area remained above the Quaternary age ice sheets, being pushed and folded by the glacier movement resulting in glaciotectonic hills. [...] The highway winds up, down and around these hills along the way. The Big Muddy Badlands are within the Missouri Coteau. [...] At km 12.2 the highway reaches Kildeer, and the intersection with Highway 18. Access to Wood Mountain Post Provincial Historical Park is obtained by following Highway 18 north for [...] This section of Highway 2 begins as a Class 4 highway and is {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Saskatchewan Highways and Transportation (SHT) South West Transportation Planning Council. [...] The highway is a secondary weight highway with a thin membrane surface type as it only has an average of 390 vehicles per day (vpd) according to the 2007 Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) count which was taken north of Rockglen. [...] Highway 2 begins a concurrency with Highway 18 in a northeasterly direction. [...] Alfalfa and alfalfa mixtures, hay and fodder crops and spring wheat are the main crops in Old Post rural municipality (RM). [...] There is a point of information at km 42.3.
