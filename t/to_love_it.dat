5|$|Wendell and Edith Willkie {{moved to}} New York in October 1929, only {{weeks before the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, and found an {{apartment}} overlooking Central Park. Initially intimidated by the size and anonymity of the big city, Wendell Willkie soon learned <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>it.</b> He attended the Broadway theatre, and read through ten newspapers each day. Willkie {{and his wife had}} little in common, and grew apart through the 1930s. He acquired a social life, and met Irita Van Doren, the book review editor of the New York Herald Tribune who became a friend, and later his lover. Cultured, brilliant and well connected, Van Doren introduced him to new books, new ideas, and new circles of friends. Unlike Van Doren, Willkie was indiscreet about their relationship, and their affair was well known to the reporters covering him during his 1940 presidential campaign. None of them printed a word.|$|E

500|$|Producer {{and drummer}} Ahmir [...] "Questlove" [...] Thompson issued {{an essay in}} 1999 that {{discussed}} the album's creation and analyzed its songs. He described the project as a [...] "vicarious fantasy", a [...] "new direction of soul for 2000", and [...] "the litmus test that will reveal the most for your personality". He addressed the inspiration behind Voodoo, saying [...] "It was a love for the dead state of black music, a love to show our idols how much they taught us [...] I hope you enjoy it. Just have an open mind to new shit. Just give us that." [...] Questlove discussed his expectations of a reaction from music listeners to the concept, saying in an interview for Entertainment Weekly upon the album's release, [...] "We knew this album would be a hard pill to swallow. People may want D to play into their R love-god fantasies—wearing Armani suits, singing something sweet in your ear—but he made {{a conscious effort to}} shake people up, to take a chance. It's not a middle-ground record—you're either going <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> or hate it." ...|$|E

[...] He discussed the character's moral ambiguity saying it fit the adage [...] "one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter," [...] adding parallels to the current world order [...] "whether it's U.S. foreign policy or the actions of some terrorists." [...] Into Darkness writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman added that they used the character of Khan not just for his popularity with the fandom—"It’s so easy to fall into the trap of doing something because you think people are going <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>it.</b> You must come up with what the movie can be on its own and then, if it turns out the villain maybe can be Khan, then you can do it.

He read the poem to both Catholic and Protestant audiences in Ireland. He commented, [...] "To read 'Requiem for the Croppies' wasn't to say ‘up the IRA’ or anything.

2500|$|Spooner {{said the}} series [...] "worked because {{it became a}} parody on itself, almost. You can only do that so long."

[...] The album has yet to surface, and for several years, Wilson has consistently maintained in interviews that he wishes his [...] "next album" [...] to be more rock-oriented.|$|E
2500|$|... "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] was {{considered}} as a sequel to Spears' debut album, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1999), percolating with a carefully measured blend of familiar pop, funk, R and power balladry. Spears said during an interview that the album has a more mature, R-flavored pop sound. [...] "It's not something I changed purposefully", Spears said of the album's sound and added: [...] "It's just something that kind of changed on itself with me being older. My voice has changed {{a little bit and}} I'm more confident, and I think that comes across on the material." [...] One of its producers, Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins talked about working with Spears on a Rolling Stones cover, stating: [...] "It's going to shock everybody", adding: [...] "It has flavors of the original, but it's a straight 2000 version — new to the ear. Which I think is cool, because people who appreciate that song are going <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>it.</b> And I made it so new and young that the young kids that love Britney are going <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>it.</b> It's going to grab both a mature and young audience." [...] Spears also worked with Robert [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, telling MTV News: [...] "When you hear the song, it's so pure and delicate. It's just one of those songs that pull you in", and added: [...] "I think they wrote it 'specially for me, because the lyrics of the song, if you really listen … they're more of what I can relate to, 'cause they're kind of young lyrics, I think. I don't think Shania would probably sing some of the words that I'm saying." ...|$|E

2500|$|Falling coconut {{injuries}} were {{featured in the}} American television series Gilligan's Island. [...] A June 1965 episode revolved around an injury sustained by Gilligan after a falling coconut {{hit him in the}} nose. [...] Actor Bob Denver explained the success of the series as follows: [...] "Little kids seem <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>it.</b> [...] It doesn't take a great intellect or reasoning power to be able to laugh at a monkey running off with Gilligan's dinner or a guy getting conked on the head by a coconut." [...] When Denver died, the show's creator Sherwood Schwartz said that Denver didn't get enough credit for his talent as a slapstick actor: [...] "A lot of people don't think it's hard to be an actor where {{all you have to do}} is react to a falling coconut." [...] In the film Cast Away, the stranded character played by Tom Hanks is alarmed several times by loud thuds, which he cannot identify. He finally sees a coconut fall, making the sound.|$|E
2500|$|Menken {{recruited}} musician Robbie Buchanan {{to arrange}} [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] into {{the form of}} a pop duet while Walter Afanasieff was responsible for producing the track. Afanasieff also assisted Buchanan in the arranging of the song. Menken was ultimately pleased with Afanasieff's production, explaining, [...] "Walter Afanasieff ... took it and really molded it into something very different than I ever intended and I grew <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>it.</b> In a way, Walter made it his own, and I love that." [...] Because Disney could not afford to hire a [...] "big singer", they drafted Canadian singer Celine Dion, who was relatively new to the music industry at the time, to record [...] "Beauty and the Beast". However, the studio feared that she would not draw much media attention because of her relative obscurity in the United States, so they hired American singer Peabo Bryson, who was a more well-known recording artist at the time, to perform alongside her. The newly arranged song was released as the album's lead single on November 25, 1991.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2015, Lucas {{recorded}} {{an hour-long}} interview with CBS News reporter Charlie Rose {{in which he}} said Disney had not been [...] "keen" [...] to involve him and conceded: [...] "If I get in there, I'm just going to cause trouble because they're not going to do what I want them to do, and I don't have the control to do that any more, and all it would do is just muck everything up." [...] He also stated: [...] "They wanted to do a retro movie. I don't like that. Every movie, I worked very hard to make them different… I made them completely different—different planets, different spaceships to make it new." [...] In early December 2015, Kathleen Kennedy told The Hollywood Reporter that Lucas had seen the movie and [...] "liked it". In the same month, at the Kennedy Center Honors, Lucas said: “I think the fans are going <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>it,</b> It’s very much the kind of movie they’ve been looking for." [...] Abrams felt that, as the first in a new trilogy, the film had [...] "needed to take a couple of steps backwards into very familiar terrain" [...] and use plot elements from previous Star Wars films.|$|E
