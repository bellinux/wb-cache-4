5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{argued that}} pressure to fill fund raising quotas {{had led to}} 2,000 instances of credit card fraud, and that organization members had sought to obstruct the investigation. The defense presented the case <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> {{was the culmination of}} a 20-year campaign of harassment by the FBI and CIA, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> was acting on the orders of the CIA when they destroyed evidence and hid witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the appellate}} ruling, on September 21, 2007, Judge Mauffray denied {{the request for}} Bell to be {{eligible}} for bail pending possible further appeal. On September 26, Parish Attorney Walters announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> would not appeal the appellate ruling, but would try Bell as a juvenile. Bell was released on $45,000bond, subject to electronic monitoring and under the supervision of a probation officer.|$|E
5|$|On 18 September, a {{preliminary}} enquiry {{in a district}} court was held {{to determine whether there}} was sufficient evidence for a trial to proceed. The magistrate overseeing the enquiry ordered Martin to stand trial for Gerard Lowe's murder on 2 October after hearing statements from 39 witnesses, and looking at more than 100 exhibits and 100 photographs <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> had prepared as evidence.|$|E
50|$|The {{adversarial}} {{system is the}} two-sided structure under which criminal trial courts operate <b>that</b> pits <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> against <b>the</b> defense.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{commission}} found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{crews were}} illegally confined and tortured during their interrogations at the Buan Police Office, which qualified {{the case for}} a retrial. Additionally, <b>the</b> commission found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> espionage charges against the abductees were falsified, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutions</b> were pursued without sufficient evidence, based only on testimony from the defendants, which did not meet the rules of evidence.|$|R
50|$|As certain State {{witnesses}} were unavailable during <b>that</b> time, <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> {{applied for a}} further postponement, so the trial was postponed to December 1996.|$|R
5|$|During the September term, a {{jury was}} finally selected, {{and the trial}} {{consumed}} {{the rest of the}} term. Much of the same evidence was presented, and the second jury also voted for a guilty verdict. The date for Desha's execution was set for July 14, 1826. Harry O. Brown, the judge in the case, had been temporarily appointed by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. He set aside the verdict, ruling <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> had failed to prove that the murder occurred in Fleming County, as charged in the indictment. The prosecution unsuccessfully argued that because a change of venue had already been granted, the place of the murder was immaterial.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1967 {{at his own}} trial Bukovsky {{used his}} final words to attack the regime's failure to respect the law or follow legal procedures. He invoked Article 125 of the (still current) 1936 Soviet Constitution to defend the right to {{organize}} demonstrations and other public protests. He further suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> had repeatedly failed to observe the revised 1961 Code of Criminal Procedure in its conduct of the case. Bukovsky's final words in court circulated widely in a samizdat collection of such addresses {{and as part of}} a collection of materials about the demonstration and subsequent trials compiled by Pavel Litvinov.|$|E
5|$|Patty is {{the lead}} {{attorney}} in a high-profile litigation, representing the bankrupted workers of a large company run by Frobisher, who allegedly advised his employees {{to invest in the}} company while selling his own stock. Patty insists on taking the case to trial rather than accepting a settlement, but on Ellen's first day it is revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> cannot yet link Frobisher to his stockbroker—though both were in Palm Beach, Florida over the same weekend—and thus cannot disprove that the selling of his stock was not pre-arranged. When Ellen returns home, her boyfriend David Connor (Noah Bean) proposes to her and she accepts.|$|E

50|$|In 2000, {{six of the}} men {{appealed to}} the European Court of Human Rights arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutions</b> against them had {{violated}} their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights by interfering with 'the right to respect for a private family life' enshrined in article 8 of the Convention. They were subsequently awarded compensation. As Williams {{was not part of}} the litigation, he was not deemed eligible by the Home Office for the compensation.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> {{case was}} {{hampered}} by a shifting theory {{on the medical}} cause of death. <b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> proposed <b>that</b> Mr. Anderson died of improper use of force, then of suffocation, then of failure to act. [...] <b>The</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two <b>prosecution</b> medical expert witnesses proposed different causes of death was also problematic.|$|R
5|$|A primary {{theme of}} the defense was that the CPUSA sought to convert the US to {{socialism}} by education, not by force. The defense claimed {{that most of the}} prosecution's documentary evidence came from older texts that pre-dated the 1935 Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, after which the CPUSA rejected violence as a means of change. Starobin, p 207. The defense attempted to introduce documents into evidence which represented the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that these policies superseded the older texts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> had introduced which emphasized violence. Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents the prosecution had produced. As a result, the defense complained that they were unable to portray the totality of their belief system to the jury.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, other historians like Masahiro Yamamoto {{have argued}} that the death {{sentence}} was too severe a penalty for Matsui's crime of mere negligence in failing to stop the massacre. The journalist Richard Minear also points out that Matsui's penalty was disproportionately severe compared to the other convicted defendants. Kuniaki Koiso was found guilty on four counts and Mamoru Shigemitsu was found guilty on five counts, in both cases including one count of negligence, and both were given prison sentences. Matsui, by contrast, was found guilty of only one count of negligence but was sentenced to death. The historian Tokushi Kasahara argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> at the IMTFE did not attempt seriously to investigate all those {{who were involved in the}} Nanking Massacre, and instead just decided to make Matsui the sole scapegoat for the whole atrocity.|$|E
5|$|On April 1, {{the defense}} {{asked for the}} new trial to be moved outside Brownsville, {{claiming}} their client had received unfair treatment {{in the media and}} there was no chance for her to have a fair trial and an unbiased jury. The request included large numbers of magazines and newspaper articles published since 1993. It did not cite any specific passages where the alleged media bias was demonstrated. The defense also filed a motion to throw out the new indictment {{on the grounds that it}} was double jeopardy. On April 27, the judge decided to postpone his decision about where to hold the trial. He also rejected the defense motion stating that the new indictment was a case of double jeopardy. The defense argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> had illegally used Brownsville and Houston grand juries to work on the case, but the judge countered that claim saying only the Houston grand jury had handled the case. On May 4, the trial was moved from Brownsville to Houston, Texas, because of the earlier extensive media coverage.|$|E

5|$|The February 1974 {{election}} {{proved to}} be the high water-mark of Thorpe's career. Thereafter his and his party's fortunes declined, particularly from late 1975 when rumours of his involvement in a plot to murder Scott began to multiply. Thorpe finally resigned the leadership in May 1976, when his position became untenable. When the matter came to court three years later, Thorpe chose not to give evidence on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> had not established its case. This stance left many questions unanswered; despite his acquittal, Thorpe was discredited and could not return to public life. From the mid-1980s he was disabled by Parkinson's disease. During his long retirement he gradually recovered the affections of his party, and by {{the time of his death}} was honoured by a later generation of leaders, who drew attention to his record as an internationalist, a supporter of human rights, and an opponent of apartheid and all forms of racism.|$|E
5|$|The {{police did}} not find the {{silencer}} in the cupboard. One of Bamber's cousins found it on 10 August, with {{what appeared to be}} flecks of red paint and blood, and took it to another of the cousin's homes; it took the police a further three days to collect it. A few days after that, it was the cousins who found a scratch on the red mantelpiece <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> said was caused by the silencer during a struggle for the gun; that accounted for the fleck of red paint. The Bible found near Sheila was not examined at all. Journalist David Connett writes that a hacksaw blade that might have been used to gain entry to the house lay in the garden for months. Officers did not take contemporaneous notes; those who had dealt with Bamber wrote down their statements weeks later. The bodies were released days after the murders, and three of them (June, Nevill and Sheila) were cremated. Bamber's clothes were not examined until one month later. Ten years later all blood samples were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In post-trial analyses, {{blame for}} the outcome varied. Mamie Till Bradley was criticized for not crying enough on the stand. The jury was noted to have been picked almost {{exclusively}} from the hill country section of Tallahatchie County, which, due to its poorer economic make-up, found whites and blacks competing for land and other agrarian opportunities. Unlike the population living closer to the river (and thus closer to Bryant and Milam in Leflore County), who possessed a noblesse oblige toward blacks, according to historian Stephen Whitaker, those {{in the eastern part}} of the county were virulent in their racism. The prosecution was criticized for dismissing any potential juror who knew Milam or Bryant, for the fear that such a juror would vote to acquit. Afterward, Whitaker noted that this was a mistake, as anyone who had personally known the defendants usually disliked them. One juror voted twice to convict, but on the third discussion, acquiesced and voted with the rest of the jury to acquit. In later interviews, the jurors acknowledged that they knew Bryant and Milam were guilty, but simply did not believe that life imprisonment or the death penalty were fit punishment for whites who had killed a black man. But two jurors said as late as 2005 that they believed the defense's case. They said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> had not proved that Till had died, nor that it was his body that was removed from the river.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> conviction, <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> openly joined Tate's {{plea for}} {{leniency}} in sentencing, and even {{offered to help}} in his appeal. The trial judge criticized <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> for compromising <b>the</b> integrity of the adversarial system, and said <b>that</b> if <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> felt <b>that</b> life imprisonment was not warranted, {{they should not have}} charged him with murder in the first place.|$|R
50|$|Balkan Insight {{characterized}} the investigation as “the most recent controversial case” and set <b>the</b> record straight <b>that</b> “later <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> rescinded {{some of its}} serious allegations against the fund’s officials,” but the Fund’s reputation was already tainted.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> of Butler was {{met with}} disapproval by many groups of scientists, {{including}} colleagues, the National Academy of Sciences, several Nobel Prize winners, and the Federation of American Scientists. Critics of <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> aggressive <b>prosecution</b> of a prominent scientist would make other scientists reluctant {{to carry out research}} in dangerous diseases for fear of similar prosecutions.|$|R
5|$|The legal {{elements}} and {{features of the}} major federal public corruption offenses differ. The various jurisdictional elements of the offenses require <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> prove, alternatively: that the payee was a federal official; that the payee organization received $10,000 in federal funds; that the corrupt communications involved {{the use of the}} mail or interstate wires; that the corruption affected interstate commerce or interstate travel. The mens rea elements differ in whether they require a quid pro quo; a mere nexus is an easier element to prove; more difficult elements to prove include the intent to be influenced and inducement. The offenses also differ in whether the act to be procured from the public official must be an official, a violation of an official duty, a fraud on the United States, or an official transaction. The offenses also differ in whether the payor may be prosecuted in addition to the public official. Finally, the offenses differ in whether they are predicates for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and money laundering prosecutions, and in the maximum authorized prison sentence that may be imposed upon conviction.|$|E
25|$|A {{judgment}} for defendant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> is barred by limitations {{goes to his}} liability in substantive law; and, in whatever form the issue was raised, such a judgment may be interposed as a conclusive bar to another prosecution for the same offense.|$|E
25|$|The defence {{stated in}} their summary <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> {{had failed to}} prove beyond {{reasonable}} doubt that Einem was guilty of murder and also weren't able to establish the exact cause of Kelvin's death, so therefore the jury must give Einem {{the benefit of the}} doubt.|$|E
5000|$|The defense {{phase of}} a trial occurs after <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> phase, <b>that</b> is, after <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> [...] "rests".

25|$|Getting to the merits, Bright argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> race-neutral {{reasons for}} the strikes were contradicted by the prosecution's actions and the {{documents}} Foster obtained.
