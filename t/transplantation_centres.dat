40|$|Background The {{number of}} {{patients}} awaiting allograft transplantation in the UK exceeds the number of organs offered for transplantation each year. Most organ donors tend to be young, fit and healthy individuals who die because of trauma or sudden cardiac arrest. Patients who die from drug and poison intoxication tend to have similar characteristics but are less frequently offered as potential organ donors. Methods A postal questionnaire survey of all <b>transplantation</b> <b>centres</b> and {{an equal number of}} intensive care units in the UK was undertaken. The use of kidney, heart, lung, liver and pancreas transplants from poisoned patients following deliberate methanol ingestion, cardiac arrest presumed secondary to cocaine overdose, accidental domestic carbon monoxide inhalation and industrial cyanide exposure were used as case scenarios. Results Response rates were 70 % for <b>transplantation</b> <b>centres</b> and 50 % for intensive care unit directors. Over 80 % of organs would be offered or discussed with transplant coordinators by intensive care unit directors. Transplantation physicians/surgeons would consider transplanting organs in up to 100 % of case scenarios, depending on the organ and poisoning or intoxication involved. Discussion The postal survey presented here shows that most transplantation physicians and surgeons and intensive care unit directors would consider those who die following acute drug intoxication and poisoning as potential organ donors. The previously reported literature shows in general that transplanted organs from poisoned patients have good long-term survival, although the number of reports is small. Poisoned patients are another pool of organ donors who at present are probably underused by transplantation services...|$|E

To describe patients' and next of kin's experiences of supportive care while awaiting lung re-transplantation and the objective was to highlight a small group with special circumstances and needs. METHODS: Using qualitative content analysis, seven adult patients and seven next of kin were consecutively selected from a regional lung <b>transplantation</b> <b>centre</b> and individually interviewed shortly after decision about lung re-transplantation.

40|$|AbstractBackgroudA biliary {{stricture}} is {{the most}} common complication after living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT). The present study was performed to examine treatment methods and outcomes after treatment for a biliary stricture after LDLT. Methods and ResultsFrom January 2000 to December 2010, 488 patients underwent LDLT using the right lobe with duct-to-duct anastomosis at our <b>transplantation</b> <b>centre.</b> Overall biliary strictures were detected in 160 patients (32. 8 %), and the majority occurred within 2 years after LDLT. Biliary strictures were related to bile leakage (P < 0. 001) and the urgency of the surgery (P = 0. 012) in a multivariate analysis. All biliary strictures were treated with interventional modalities including an endoscopic or a percutaneous approach. Failure of interventional treatment was demonstrated in 13 patients (8. 5 %), among them, four (2. 6 %) underwent re-transplantation and nine (5. 9 %) died of sepsis and biliary cirrhosis during the follow-up period. A biliary stricture was not related to the survival rate (P = 0. 586). ConclusionThe incidence of overall biliary stricture was related to bile leakage and the urgency of the surgery.

The joint experience of the two centres is presented. METHODS: Patients with irreversible small intestinal failure and complications of parenteral nutrition, and those with abdominal disease requiring extensive visceral resection, were assessed as candidates and where appropriate listed for surgery. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were assessed for small intestinal transplantation and, of these, 14 underwent surgery. Twelve patients survived the transplantation procedure. Of these, seven patients were alive at 1 year, five at 3 years and three at 5 years. Three patients remain alive.

40|$|Background. : Cognitions {{surrounding}} living organ donation, {{including the}} motivation to donate, expectations of donation and worries about donation, are relevant themes during living donor evaluation. However, there is no reliable psychometric instrument assessing all these different cognitions. This study developed and validated a questionnaire to assess pre-donation motivations, expectations and worries regarding donation, entitled the Donation Cognition Instrument (DCI). Methods. : Psychometric properties of the DCI were examined using exploratory factor analysis for scale structure and associations with validated questionnaires for construct validity assessment. Results. : From seven Dutch <b>transplantation</b> <b>centres,</b> 719 potential living kidney donors were included. The DCI distinguishes cognitions about donor benefits, recipient benefits, idealistic incentives, gratitude and worries about donation (Cronbach's alpha 0. 76 - 0. 81).
