5|$|Centuries after Lisa's death, Mona Lisa {{became the}} world's most famous {{painting}} and {{took on a}} life separate from Lisa, the woman. Speculation by scholars and hobbyists made {{the work of art}} a globally recognized icon and an object of commercialization. In 2005, Lisa was definitively identified as the model for <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, {{the color}} of {{clothing}} showed a person's social rank and profession. Red could only be worn by the nobility, brown and gray by peasants, and green by merchants, bankers and the gentry and their families. <b>The</b> <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> wears green in her portrait, as does the bride in the Arnolfini portrait by Jan van Eyck.|$|E
5|$|While in Paris, the Doctor and Romana {{sense the}} effects of time distortion. They observe the Countess Scarlioni using an alien device to scan the {{security}} systems housing Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa at the Louvre. The pair meet Inspector Duggan, who suspects the Countess {{to be involved in}} an ongoing art theft scheme with her husband, Count Scarlioni. Duggan joins the Doctor and Romana in investigating the Scarlioni mansion. There, they find equipment used by Dr. Kerensky to experiment in time, the source of the time distortions, as well as six exact copies of <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa.</b> The Doctor instructs Romana and Duggan to continue investigating here while he returns to the TARDIS to visit da Vinci, a good friend of his. After the Doctor leaves, the Count returns after successfully stealing <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa,</b> and captures Romana and Duggan. Learning that Romana is familiar with time, he kills Dr. Kerensky and forces Romana to continue the tests.|$|E

5|$|City of Death {{features}} the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) and his companion Romana (Lalla Ward). Set mainly in Paris in 1979, the plot concerns a scheme by an alien, Scaroth, to steal <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> to finance experiments in time {{travel in the}} hope of averting the accident that marooned him on Earth four hundred million years previously, which began the existence of life on the planet as well.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the qualities}} that make Leonardo's work unique are his {{innovative}} techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology; his interest in physiognomy and the way humans register emotion in expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use of subtle gradation of tone. All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa,</b> the Last Supper, and the Virgin of the Rocks.|$|E
5|$|Among {{his famous}} {{drawings}} are the Vitruvian Man, {{a study of}} the proportions of the human body; the Head of an Angel, for The Virgin of the Rocks in the Louvre; a botanical study of Star of Bethlehem; and a large drawing (160×100cm) in black chalk on coloured paper of The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist in the National Gallery, London. This drawing employs the subtle sfumato technique of shading, in the manner of <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa.</b> It is thought that Leonardo never made a painting from it, the closest similarity being to The Virgin and Child with St. Anne in the Louvre.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo was, and is, renowned {{primarily}} as a painter. Among his works, <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> is the most famous and most parodied portrait and The Last Supper the most reproduced religious painting of all time. Leonardo's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon, being reproduced on items {{as varied as the}} euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts. Perhaps fifteen of his paintings have survived. Nevertheless, these few works, together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting, compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary, Michelangelo.|$|E
5|$|Homer, having {{forgotten}} Marge's birthday, rushes {{out to buy}} her {{a present}} at the Springfield Mall. He finds a bowling ball and decides to buy it for her. During the night of her birthday dinner at the Singing Sirloin, Marge is happy with the kids' presents of French perfume from Bart and a macaroni and glue card of her as <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> from Lisa. However, she is offended by Homer's gift as it is another demonstration of his thoughtless gift giving history, which her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier had reminded her of earlier. To make matters worse, as he presents his 'gift', it bursts through its box and squashes Marge's birthday cake. Deeply resentful, Marge reminds him that not only has she never gone bowling in her life, but the ball is also inscribed with his name.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Doctor {{arrives at}} da Vinci's home but is {{captured}} by Captain Tancredi, who appears identical to Count Scarlioni. Tancredi reveals {{he is really}} Scaroth, {{a member of the}} Jagaroth race. They had arrived on Earth 400 million years ago, but due an explosion in their craft, all of the others died and his own body was fragmented across time. Collectively, the fragments of Scaroth have manipulated humanity so that by the 20th century, they will have technology that will enable him to go back in time to stop the explosion. Tancredi is currently employing da Vinci to create copies of <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> as to finance Scarlioni's work. After Tancredi leaves, the Doctor knocks out his captor, marks the blank canvases with a felt-tip pen, and leaves a message to da Vinci to paint over his writing before returning to the present.|$|E

5000|$|According to Leonardo's early biographer Giorgio Vasari, Leonardo {{had started}} to paint <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> in 1503, but [...] "left it un{{finished}}". However, a fully finished painting of a [...] "certain Florentine lady" [...] surfaced again in 1517, shortly before Leonardo's death and in his private possession. The latter painting almost certainly {{is the one that}} now hangs in the Louvre. Based on this contradiction, supporters of the authenticity of <b>the</b> Isleworth <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> claim it is <b>the</b> unfinished <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa,</b> made at least partially by Leonardo, and <b>the</b> Louvre <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> a later version of it, made by Leonardo for his own use.|$|R
50|$|Record label changes came {{quickly after}} the mid-1980s, partly {{accounting}} {{for the number of}} compilation albums in Graham Parker's discography. Particularly unproductive was Parker's tenure at Atlantic Records, where he released nothing and signed to RCA Records. He began producing his own recordings and issued <b>The</b> <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa's</b> Sister. <b>The</b> backing band for this album included former Rumour-mates Schwarz and Bodnar; keyboardists James Halliwell and Steve Nieve; and drummer Terry Williams (replaced on one cut by Andy Duncan, and two others by Pete Thomas, who, like Nieve, was a member of Elvis Costello and the Attractions). Rolling Stone magazine ranked <b>The</b> <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa's</b> Sister at No. 97 on its list of The 100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s.|$|R
5|$|Speculation {{assigned}} Lisa's name to {{at least}} four different paintings and her identity {{to at least}} ten different people. By {{the end of the}} 20th century, the painting was a global icon that had been used in more than 300 other paintings and in 2,000advertisements, appearing at an average of one new advertisement each week. In 2005, an expert at the University Library of Heidelberg discovered a margin note in the library's collection that established with certainty the traditional view that the sitter was Lisa. The note, written by Agostino Vespucci in 1503, states that Leonardo was working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo. <b>The</b> <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> has been in custody of France since the 16th century, when it was acquired by King Francis I; after the French Revolution, however, it came into the possession of the people. Today about six million people visit the painting each year at the Louvre in Paris, where {{it is part of a}} French national collection.|$|E
5|$|Petrus Christus {{placed his}} sitter in a naturalistic setting {{rather than a}} flat and featureless background. This {{approach}} was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces. In his 1462 , Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape, while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in fresco and illuminated manuscripts. Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power. Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring Leonardo's positioning of <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> {{in front of a}} landscape view. Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist Jean Fouquet and the Germans Hans Pleydenwurff and Martin Schongauer among others.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa</b> has {{had many}} {{different}} decorative frames in its history, owing {{to changes in}} taste over the centuries. In 1909, the Comtesse de Béhague gave the portrait its current frame, a Renaissance-era work consistent with the historical period of <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> <b>Lisa.</b> The edges of the painting have been trimmed {{at least once in}} its history to fit the picture into various frames, but no part of the original paint layer has been trimmed.|$|E
