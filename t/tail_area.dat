The study was located in some inactive <b>tailing</b> deposition <b>areas</b> in between Double Levee of the lowland area of ModADA (Modification Ajkwa Deposition Areas). Samples were taken from inactive tailing as 198 of ModADA for soil and soil fauna, the Kuadran Method was used to collecting soil fauna on the soil surface and in the soil. There were 17 types/ordo of soil fauna in the study area and the highest number was a group of ants (Hymenoptera/Formicidae). Population density (PD) and relative density (RD) of soil fauna (Formicidae) ranged from 0. 03 - 2. 41 Individu m- 2 (PD) and 0. 07 - 6. 50 % (RD). Both PD and RD were likely to increase as the number of soil fauna increase.

40|$|In {{the fields}} of {{genomics}} and high-dimensional biology (HDB), massive multiple testing prompts the use of extremely small significance levels. Because <b>tail</b> <b>areas</b> of statistical distributions are needed for hypothesis testing, the accuracy of these areas is important to confidently make scientific judgments. Previous work on accuracy was primarily focused on evaluating professionally written statistical software, like SAS, on the Statistical Reference Datasets (StRD) provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and on the accuracy of <b>tail</b> <b>areas</b> in statistical distributions. The goal {{of this paper is}} to provide guidance to investigators, who are developing their own custom scientific software built upon numerical libraries written by others. Specifically, we evaluate the accuracy of small <b>tail</b> <b>areas</b> from cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of the Chi-square and t-distribution by comparing several open-source, free, or commercially licensed numerical libraries in Java, C, and R to widely accepted standards of comparison like ELV and DCDFLIB.

These languages and libraries are popular choices among programmers developing scientific software, so the results herein can be useful to programmers in choosing libraries for CDF accuracy. ...|$|R

The cooling air exit from the oil and coolant radiators was reduced in area to match the exit velocity to the local flow. New engine exhaust stacks, deflected to match the local flow and with nozzles to increase thrust augmentation, were installed.

Thirty species representing 10 families were identified. Of this number, darters (Percidae), sculpins (Cottidae), madtoms (Ictaluridae), and central stonerollers (Campostoma anomalum) (Cyprinidae) comprised 67 to 98 percent of riffle head populations. Fish biomass was greater for riffle head areas (0. 58 - 6. 6 / 0. 28 - 2. 0 g/m 2) within sectivores and herbivores dominating.

However, lower lice infestation in growers aged 24 to 40 weeks from Farms 1 (72 %), 2 (62. 7 %) and 3 (73. 3 %), and no mite infesta-tion were observed.

40|$|Artesian {{springs in}} arid Australia house endemic species with very small {{geographic}} distributions (most < 50 km(2)). These species have limited dispersal capabilities, but {{little is known}} about environmental variance within and across these springs and how it, too, may limit their distribution and abundance. At the Pelican Creek springs complex, the full diversity of endemic gastropod fauna is found only in springs with deep pools, an area thought to provide greater environmental stability. This implies that the distributions of most snail species at this site may be restricted by their narrow environmental requirements and limits. This study monitored spatiotemporal environmental variance in a subset of the Pelican Creek springs (within Edgbaston Reserve) across one year to assess whether pool <b>areas</b> differ from <b>tail</b> <b>areas,</b> and how patterns of abundance of six snail species from three different families correspond to this variance. Springs fluctuated considerably in size, depth, water chemistry and temperature at daily and seasonal scales. Patterns of environmental variance differed across areas; pools were spatiotemporally stable, and tails were ephemeral and environmentally variable. The snail species occupied these areas in different ways. Species restricted to deep springs generally had significantly higher abundance in pool areas, and most had narrow environmental limits. In contrast, species found in a greater number of springs, including those with no pool, occupied pool and <b>tail</b> <b>areas</b> and generally had broader environmental limits. Environmental variance within and across springs affects the distribution of snails in a species-specific fashion. This has important implications for how we study springs and reveals that whilst the vast majority of species are restricted to areas of environmental stability, some can persist in the most environmentally variable areas...|$|R
