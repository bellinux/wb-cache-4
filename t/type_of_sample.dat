2500|$|This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> made {{possible}} {{estimation of the}} low unblocking temperature.

Deprived of one of its components, the overall field changed direction. A plot of direction at each increment identified the increment at which the sample's resultant magnetism had formed. That was considered to be the equilibrium temperature of the deposit. Considering the data for all the deposits of the surge arrived at a surge deposit estimate. The authors discovered that the city, Pompeii, was a relatively cool spot within a much hotter field, which they attributed to interaction of the surge with the [...] "fabric" [...] of the city.|$|E

30|$|Supportive Vector Machine (SVM) is a {{supervised}} {{machine learning}} method that can learn the characteristics <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> known <b>samples</b> and predict unknown samples.

50|$|A Medical Technologist (usually Medical {{laboratory}} scientist, Clinical Laboratory Scientist, Medical Laboratory Technologist) is an allied {{health professional}} that analyzes and tests body fluids and tissues.

5000|$|Light {{sources for}} fluorometers are often {{dependent}} on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> being tested. Among the most common light source for fluorometers is the low-pressure mercury lamp. This provides many excitation wavelengths, making it the most versatile. However, this lamp is not a continuous source of radiation. The xenon arc lamp is used when a continuous source of radiation is needed. Both of these sources provide a suitable spectrum of ultraviolet light that induces chemiluminescence. These are just two of the many possible light sources.|$|E

The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> sent to the {{laboratory}} often depends on the type of viral infection being diagnosed and the test required. Blood is used for serological testing for antibody and antigen detection in a variety of different infections as well as monitoring viraemias. Sputum, gargles and bronchial washings are used to detect respiratory viruses such as influenza. Faeces are usually sent to determine the presence of viral gastroenteritis agents. Other samples include swabs (usually in viral transport medium), cerebrospinal fluid, biopsies and post mortem tissues, dried blood spots and others.|$|E
