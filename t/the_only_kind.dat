500|$|Citing {{from both}} {{pornography}} and literature—including The Kreutzer Sonata, Madame Bovary, and Dracula—Dworkin argued that depictions of intercourse in mainstream {{art and culture}} consistently emphasized heterosexual intercourse as <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>kind</b> of [...] "real" [...] sex, portrayed intercourse in violent or invasive terms, portrayed the violence or invasiveness as central to its eroticism, and often united it with male contempt for, revulsion towards, or even murder of, the [...] "carnal" [...] woman. She argued {{that this kind of}} depiction enforced a male-centric and coercive view of sexuality, and that, when the cultural attitudes combine with the material conditions of women's lives in a sexist society, the experience of heterosexual intercourse itself becomes a central part of men's subordination of women, experienced as a form of [...] "occupation" [...] that is nevertheless expected to be pleasurable for women and to define their very status as women.|$|E

[...] Later, in The Sickness Unto Death Kierkegaard writes of the sin of despairing over one's sin and the sin of despairing of the forgiveness of sins. Robert L. Perkins from Mercer University published a group of essays about these three discourses in 2006. Kierkegaard has moved forward from fear and trembling to fear and wonder within the two years of his published works. Wonder is more positive than fear.|$|E

Colby agreed with his colleagues that Richardson's removal was a major factor, regarding it as [...] "a policy decision just to indicate the end of a close relationship with Nhu". Richardson was close to Diem and the CIA provided both technical assistance and financing to Nhu's Special Forces.

In their December 2013 ruling striking down the ACT's same-sex marriage law, the High Court effectively determined that all laws with respect to marriage were an exclusive power of the Commonwealth and that no state or territory law legalising same-sex marriage or creating any type of marriage could operate concurrently with the federal Marriage Act; [...] "the kind of marriage provided for by the [...] Act is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>kind</b> of marriage that may be formed or recognised in Australia".

2500|$|During the 1960s, Crick became {{concerned}} with {{the origins of the}} genetic code. In 1966, Crick took the place of Leslie Orgel at a meeting where Orgel was to talk about the origin of life. Crick speculated about possible stages by which an initially simple code with a few amino acid types might have evolved into the more complex code used by existing organisms. At that time, everyone thought of proteins as <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>kind</b> of enzymes, and ribozymes had not yet been found. Many molecular biologists were puzzled by the problem of the origin of a protein replicating system that is as complex as that which exists in organisms currently inhabiting Earth. In the early 1970s, Crick and Orgel further speculated about the possibility that the production of living systems from molecules may have been a very rare event in the universe, but once it had developed it could be spread by intelligent life forms using space travel technology, a process they called [...] "directed panspermia". In a retrospective article, Crick and Orgel noted that they had been overly pessimistic about the chances of abiogenesis on Earth when they had assumed that some kind of self-replicating protein system was the molecular origin of life.|$|E
2500|$|Rene Girard has {{demonstrated}} that the Gospels are a radical subversion of pagan notions of sacrifice. Instead of humans offering victims to angry deities (as is always the case with pagan sacrifice), Jesus, as the incarnate presence of God (YHWH), offers himself {{into the hands of}} violent humans to reveal what the Hebrew prophets meant when they said that [...] "the Lord" [...] (YHWH) rejects sacrifice and desires justice and mercy instead. The [...] "self-sacrifice" [...] of Christ is, therefore, a revelation that violent sacrifice {{has nothing to do with}} God. It is simply murder—which the story of Cain and Abel showed at the very dawn of civilisation (Cain is called [...] "father of cities"). Saint Paul calls on Christians in his Letter to the Romans (12:1) to do the very opposite of conventional religious sacrifice: [...] "offer your own bodies as a living sacrifice", he says, instead of the dead bodies of others. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>kind</b> of [...] "sacrifice" [...] acceptable to God is to give one's life for others, which means to live one's life for others, even unto death, just as Jesus did.
