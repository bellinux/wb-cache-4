5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E

5|$|The Las Vegas {{situation}} {{was one of}} a bevy of developments that absorbed the league in the 1994 to 1995 offseason.

A group from Miami, Florida tried to convince the league <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> buy the remains of the Posse and move them to South Florida as the Miami Manatees in the Miami Orange Bowl. An exhibition game between Birmingham and Baltimore was held there in June 1995 to gauge support, which drew a decent crowd just above 20,000.|$|E

It reached the Noord, the river separating the Alblasserwaard from IJsselmonde, in the evening. There they discovered that the sector near the only bridge, built in 1939, was not strongly occupied by the airborne troops, as the Germans simply had not known of its existence because of outdated maps. It was decided to postpone a crossing until the next day, to gather sufficient forces. No {{attempt was made to}} establish a bridgehead.|$|E
