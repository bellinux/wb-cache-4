5|$|Worker {{termites}} {{undertake the}} most labour within the colony, {{being responsible for}} foraging, food storage, and brood and nest maintenance. Workers are tasked with the digestion of cellulose in food and are thus the most likely caste {{to be found in}} infested wood. The process of worker termites feeding other nestmates is known as <b>trophallaxis.</b> <b>Trophallaxis</b> is an effective nutritional tactic to convert and recycle nitrogenous components. It frees the parents from feeding all but the first generation of offspring, allowing for the group to grow much larger and ensuring that the necessary gut symbionts are transferred from one generation to another. Some termite species do not have a true worker caste, instead relying on nymphs that perform the same work without differentiating as a separate caste.|$|E
5|$|As some {{scientists}} such as Dlussky believed Sphecomyrma {{was not an}} ant, {{they thought it was}} solitary and semi-communal. Further statements include that the morphology of sphecomyrmines would prevent workers from transporting larvae or engaging in <b>trophallaxis</b> (transfer of food between two nestmates) with them. However, wasps with antennal proportions similar to sphecomyrmines are able to feed their own larvae. The presence of the metapleural gland also shows that Sphecomyrma was a eusocial (the highest level of organisation of animal sociality) insect and lived in colonies, as this gland possibly acts as a disinfectant in order to nest in soil and leaf litter without infecting the colony's nestmates and brood. The large eyes, long appendages and thin exoskeleton suggests that workers were epigaeic, where they foraged above ground and out in the open. Fossil evidence further suggests that they foraged socially with other worker ants.|$|E
5|$|M.regularis is {{a highly}} {{aggressive}} ant that will pursue any intruder to a distance of 1.8–2.7 metres (2–3 yards) if their nests are disturbed. Their stings are very painful and particularly powerful. In some cases, human victims of M.regularis bites have displayed an allergy to the venom. In a 2011 study which investigated the causes of ant sting anaphylaxis in Australia, 265 of the 376 human participants reacted to the sting of several Myrmecia species. Of these, nine serum samples taken from patients were IgE positive to the venom of M.regularis. These ants are both diurnal and nocturnal, foraging on the trunks of Eucalyptus trees to feed on sap and nectar, or capturing small insects (such as caterpillars and ants in the genus Camponotus or subgenus Orthocrema). The larvae are carnivorous and exclusively feed on insects, either consuming small portions of the insect or all of it. Unlike most Myrmecia species, <b>trophallaxis</b> takes place among adults or between adults and larvae. All stages of the frog Metacrinia nichollsi are known to dwell inside M.regularis colonies, where they use several galleries constructed by the ants. The parasitic ant M.inquilina may attempt to enter M.regularis nests to establish colonies, but M.inquilina queens may be seized and killed {{as soon as the}} two species come into contact.|$|E
5|$|Most {{termites}} are blind, so communication primarily occurs through chemical, {{mechanical and}} pheromonal cues. These {{methods of communication}} are used {{in a variety of}} activities, including foraging, locating reproductives, construction of nests, recognition of nestmates, nuptial flight, locating and fighting enemies, and defending the nests. The most common way of communicating is through antennation. A number of pheromones are known, including contact pheromones (which are transmitted when workers are engaged in <b>trophallaxis</b> or grooming) and alarm, trail and sex pheromones. The alarm pheromone and other defensive chemicals are secreted from the frontal gland. Trail pheromones are secreted from the sternal gland, and sex pheromones derive from two glandular sources: the sternal and tergal glands. When termites go out to look for food, they forage in columns along the ground through vegetation. A trail can be identified by the faecal deposits or runways that are covered by objects. Workers leave pheromones on these trails, which are detected by other nestmates through olfactory receptors. Termites can also communicate through mechanical cues, vibrations, and physical contact. These signals are frequently used for alarm communication or for evaluating a food source.|$|E
5|$|Some ant {{species are}} {{considered}} as pests, primarily those {{that occur in}} human habitations, where their presence is often problematic. For example, the presence of ants would be undesirable in sterile places such as hospitals or kitchens. Some species or genera commonly categorized as pests include the Argentine ant, pavement ant, yellow crazy ant, banded sugar ant, Pharaoh ant, carpenter ants, odorous house ant, red imported fire ant, and European fire ant. Some ants will raid stored food, others may damage indoor structures, some can damage agricultural crops directly (or by aiding sucking pests), and some will sting or bite. The adaptive nature of ant colonies make it nearly impossible to eliminate entire colonies and most pest management practices aim to control local populations and tend to be temporary solutions. Ant populations are managed {{by a combination of}} approaches that make use of chemical, biological and physical methods. Chemical methods include the use of insecticidal bait which is gathered by ants as food and brought back to the nest where the poison is inadvertently spread to other colony members through <b>trophallaxis.</b> Management is based on the species and techniques can vary according to the location and circumstance.|$|E
25|$|This species {{engages in}} <b>trophallaxis</b> with the larvae. Regardless of the {{attributes}} {{and conditions of}} each larva, they are fed roughly {{the same amount of}} liquid food. The rate of <b>trophallaxis</b> may increase with larval food deprivation, but such increase depends on the size of each larva. Larvae that are fed regularly tend to be given small amounts. To reach satiation, all larvae regardless of their size generally require the equivalent of eight hours of feeding.|$|E
25|$|The {{exchange}} of food, <b>trophallaxis,</b> {{can be used}} to communicate the quality of a food source, temperature, a need for water, and the condition of the queen (Sebeok, 1990).|$|E
25|$|Hornets at the apiary are {{captured}} and fed a sugar solution or bee {{that has been}} poisoned with malathion. The toxin is expected to spread through <b>trophallaxis.</b> This method is good in principle, but has not been tested extensively.|$|E
25|$|Females {{exchange}} food {{either by}} {{facing each other}} and engaging in <b>trophallaxis</b> (the transfer of liquid food by putting the mandibles in opposition) {{or in some cases}} by mounting another female and bending over her thorax to transfer food. The reproductive females solicit the most frequently.|$|E
25|$|The larval saliva of B. petiolata {{contains}} many amino acids and nutrients that {{are useful for}} adult wasps. Females who are looking to lay eggs solicit larvae {{in order to receive}} some salivary fluid so they can gain some nutrients before laying the eggs. To do this, females undergo <b>trophallaxis</b> with the larvae. The larvae are first fed masticated food by the females wasps and then in return, the larvae produce salivary fluid. Usually, the wasps prompt the larvae to produce this salivary secretion by antennating a larva's head and vibrating its body. The larva then extends its head and produces a drop of clear saliva. Adults wasps prefer to solicit older larvae for <b>trophallaxis,</b> likely because they expect to receive more saliva from older larvae than from younger larvae. Sometimes, body vibrations of soliciting adults become synchronized and this seems to excite the larva in a positive way.|$|E
25|$|Morphologically, few {{differences}} are seen between the foundress and subordinate {{members of the}} colony. However, behavioral differentiation does occur, with the role an individual female takes being determined by social interaction within the colony. Dominant females, {{also known as the}} queens, are the principal egg-layers. Queens occupy the nest, oviposit, and rarely forage. In comparison, auxiliaries, or subordinate females, primarily forage and do not lay eggs. Autumnal helpers display a unique, behavioral phenotype demonstrated by {{only a small percentage of}} workers. These individuals leave their natal nest to overwinter to found new colonies in the spring. Compared to nonhelpers, these helpers exhibit higher overall levels of activity, demonstrating higher frequencies of behaviors. Specifically, they gave more <b>trophallaxis,</b> attacked more, and received more ritualized dominance behavior (RDB). Nonhelpers received more <b>trophallaxis</b> and performed more RDB. The survival rate of helpers is around 14%, while the survival rate of nonhelpers is around 59%.|$|E
25|$|In some insect groups, these endosymbionts live in {{specialized}} insect cells called bacteriocytes (also called mycetocytes), and are maternally-transmitted, i.e. {{the mother}} transmits her endosymbionts to her offspring. In some cases, the bacteria are transmitted in the egg, as in Buchnera; in others like Wigglesworthia, they are transmitted via milk {{to the developing}} insect embryo. In termites, the endosymbionts reside within the hindguts and are transmitted through <b>trophallaxis</b> among colony members.|$|E
25|$|L. vechti {{frequently}} request <b>trophallaxis</b> {{from other}} members within their colonies. This behavior is most exhibited whenever a forager {{returns to the}} colony. A fellow colony member may solicit food from the individual {{in a variety of}} ways. The solicitor may approach the forager and bite her on her clypeus or her mouthparts. The two wasps may also push their heads against each other as if they are fighting. While this happens, they either do not move their antennae or hold them quivering to one side, and their abdomens are pointed downwards slightly. A wasp might also solicit food by rubbing the sides of the other individual's head with her front legs and flapping her wings vigorously. <b>Trophallaxis</b> usually happens too quickly to be observed, and a forager will often leave the nest a few seconds after arriving because she is often rushed by many wasps at the same time. Foragers also often return with insects (such as ants or termites) which they have chewed up and feed to the larvae.|$|E
25|$|Lycaenids are {{diverse in}} their food habits {{and apart from}} phytophagy, {{some of them are}} {{entomophagous}} feeding on aphids, scale insects, and ant larvae. Some lycaenids even exploit their association with ants by inducing ants to feed them by regurgitation, a process called <b>trophallaxis.</b> Not all lycaenid butterflies need ants, but about 75% of species associate with ants, a relationship called myrmecophily. These associations can be mutualistic, parasitic, or predatory depending on the species.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{a degree}} of {{plasticity}} is found within V. acadica’s behaviors. This allows for the individuals to shift between different activities depending on what is needed at a specific time by the colony. However, while these wasps are flexible with regard to roles, there is a noted tendency for workers to specialize in one specific task. These tendencies {{are referred to as}} flexible age polyethism and task fixation, and are common in many Vespinae and Polistinae wasps. The most dominant task witnessed in workers was inactivity, followed by <b>trophallaxis,</b> nursing, thermoregulation then defense and foraging, in that order.|$|E
25|$|The diet of {{the adult}} yellowjacket {{consists}} primarily of items rich in sugars and carbohydrates, such as fruits, flower nectar, and tree sap. Larvae feed on proteins derived from insects, meats, and fish, which are collected by the adults, which chew and condition them before feeding them to the larvae. Many of the insects collected by the adults are considered pest species, making the yellowjacket beneficial to agriculture. Larvae, in return, secrete a sugar material to be eaten by the adults; this exchange {{is a form of}} <b>trophallaxis.</b> In late summer, foraging workers pursue other food sources from meats to ripe fruits, or scavenge human garbage, sodas, picnics, etc., as additional sugar is needed to foster the next generation's queens.|$|E
25|$|A large {{variety of}} {{pathogens}} and nematodes also infect red imported fire ants. Pathogens include Myrmecomyces annellisae, Mattesia spp., Steinernema spp., a mermithid nematode, Vairimorpha invictae, {{which can be}} transmitted via live larvae and pupae and dead adults and Tetradonema solenopsis, which can be fatal to {{a large portion of}} a colony. Individuals infected by Metarhizium anisopliae tend to perform <b>trophallaxis</b> more frequently and have an enhanced preference to quinine, an alkaloid substance. Phorid flies with Kneallhazia solenopsae can serve as vectors in transmitting the disease to the ants. Weakening the colony, infections from this disease are localised within the body fat, with spores only occurring in adult individuals. The mortality of an infected colony tends to be greater in contrast to those that are healthy. These ants are a host to Conidiobolus, Myrmicinosporidium durum, and Beauveria bassiana, each of which are parasitic fungi. Infected individuals have spores all over their bodies and appear darker than usual. The toxicity from antimicrobial property of volatiles produced by the ants can significantly reduce the germination rate of B. bassiana within the colony.|$|E
25|$|Foraging wasps gather nectar and prey for {{nourishment}} and water, resin, {{and wood}} pulp for the nest. Nectar {{is a crucial}} resource for any colony since it is used for feeding both immatures and adults. Foragers also acquire nectar at lower energy costs compared to that needed to capture prey. It {{seems to be more}} advantageous for P. exigua to take the prey in the crop, since their flight becomes less difficult. The number of prey captured by foraging wasps tends to increase as the colony grows. In addition, P. exigua have been reported performing <b>trophallaxis</b> with adults and between adults and larvae. Foraging for animal proteins is the most complex task for worker wasps. In order to successfully hunt prey, wasps require prey recognition, predation ability and the capacity to return to the nest. Foragers must make recognition flights to get an image of the surrounding landmarks that compose its environment at different distances. These flights ultimately enable wasps to use visual markers to direct them back to their colony. It is extremely important that workers carry water to the nest; water collection occurs more often in the warmer periods of the day. Water is a crucial source for nest building, and in its absence, this activity would not happen efficiently. Wood pulp is also collected and taken to the nest for building and nest infrastructure.|$|E
500|$|The {{life of an}} ant {{starts from}} an egg. If the egg is fertilised, the progeny will be female diploid; if not, it will be male haploid. Ants develop by {{complete}} metamorphosis with the larva stages passing through a pupal stage before emerging as an adult. The larva is largely immobile and is fed and cared for by workers. Food {{is given to the}} larvae by <b>trophallaxis,</b> a process in which an ant regurgitates liquid food held in its crop. This is also how adults share food, stored in the [...] "social stomach". Larvae, especially in the later stages, may also be provided solid food, such as trophic eggs, pieces of prey, and seeds brought by workers.|$|E
500|$|Ants use {{pheromone}}s {{for more}} than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use [...] "propaganda pheromones" [...] to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by <b>trophallaxis,</b> transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to raise new queens in the colony.|$|E
500|$|Termites {{have long}} been {{accepted}} to be closely related to cockroaches and mantids, and they are classified in the same superorder (Dictyoptera). Strong evidence suggests termites are highly specialised wood-eating cockroaches. The cockroach genus Cryptocercus shares the strongest phylogenetical similarity with termites and {{is considered to be}} a sister-group to termites. Termites and Cryptocercus share similar morphological and social features: for example, most cockroaches do not exhibit social characteristics, but Cryptocercus takes care of its young and exhibits other social behaviour such as <b>trophallaxis</b> and allogrooming. The primitive giant northern termite (Mastotermes darwiniensis) exhibits numerous cockroach-like characteristics that are not shared with other termites, such as laying its eggs in rafts and having anal lobes on the wings. Cryptocercidae and Isoptera are united in the clade Xylophagodea. Although termites are sometimes called [...] "white ants", they are actually not ants. Ants belong to the family Formicidae within the order Hymenoptera. The similarity of their social structure to that of termites is attributed to convergent evolution.|$|E
2500|$|Buczkowski and Bennett {{also studied}} {{the pattern of}} food {{movement}} within a nest. They labeled sucrose with Immunoglobin G (IgG) proteins, and then identified them using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to track the movement of food. They found that food was spread through <b>trophallaxis,</b> which is when one animal regurgitates food to another. [...] Despite this trophallactic spread of food, the workers kept most of the sucrose. They also found that some queens received more food than others, suggesting a dominance hierarchy even between [...] queens. They {{also found that the}} nests were located in a system of trails, and that their distribution depended on where food was found and the distance between these patches of food.|$|E

50|$|Although {{this is an}} obligate symbiosis, newly-hatched larvae do {{not have}} gut flagellates. These are {{acquired}} when the larvae are fed with flagellate-containing anal fluids from {{other members of the}} colony (proctodeal <b>trophallaxis).</b> Proctodeal <b>trophallaxis</b> is also used to replenish flagellates and other gut symbionts after each moult.|$|E
50|$|Many wasps, like Protopolybia exigua and Belonogaster petiolata, exhibit {{foraging}} behavior where adults perform <b>trophallaxis</b> {{with adults}} and between adults and larvae. This {{is also true}} for some bees such as Xylocopa pubescens. In X. pubescens, <b>trophallaxis</b> {{has led to the}} guarding behavior that the species is known for.|$|E

50|$|In addition, Vespula austriaca wasps also {{engage in}} <b>trophallaxis</b> with its host workers to obtain nutrients.|$|E
50|$|Vertebrates such as some bird species, gray wolves, and vampire bats also {{feed their}} young through <b>trophallaxis.</b>|$|E
50|$|This species {{engages in}} <b>trophallaxis</b> with the larvae. Regardless of the {{attributes}} {{and conditions of}} each larva, they are fed roughly {{the same amount of}} liquid food.

50|$|While other wasp queens {{depend on}} {{secretions}} from larvae for food, Vespula austriaca parasites obtain their nourishment in the liquid form through solicitations and <b>trophallaxis</b> of host workers. They rarely solicit larvae for nourishment. The parasites will often {{use force to}} obtain what they need. During forced feeding, the parasite will grab the host worker using its forelegs to reel in the worker. More forceful behavior includes pushing the host worker against a comb of the nest. While some parasitic behavior (i.e. maulings) only occurs during early post-invasion stages, forced <b>trophallaxis</b> behavior occurs throughout. Towards the later stages, the intensity of forced feeding declined, leading to host workers escaping forced encounters. Usually forced <b>trophallaxis</b> encounters were short lasting from 1-5 seconds. But some encounters lasted {{for as long as}} 43 seconds. Lastly, the larve of Vespsula austriaca obtain nutrients from insects and spiders.|$|E
50|$|In M. genalis, the bee exchanges liquid food {{through a}} process called <b>trophallaxis,</b> which has {{indications}} for social status. While in other species, it is often seen that the flow of exchanged food goes from worker bees to the dominant bees, {{this is not the}} case in this unique species. This supports the idea that social behavior is an evolved adaptation, as food is still equally shared in two-bee colonies. It is believed that <b>trophallaxis</b> is an independently adopted behavior of this species, rather than evolutionary behavior.|$|E
50|$|The {{exchange}} of food, <b>trophallaxis,</b> {{can be used}} to communicate the quality of a food source, temperature, a need for water, and the condition of the queen (Sebeok, 1990).|$|E
50|$|<b>Trophallaxis</b> {{serves as}} a means of communication, at least in bees, like M. genalis, and ants. In some species of ants, it {{may play a role in}} {{spreading}} the colony odour that identifies members.|$|E
