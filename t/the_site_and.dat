40|$|We {{studied the}} field host {{specificity}} of the microsporidia Thelohania solenopsae and Vairimorpha invictae and their prevalence in the imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta and S. richteri. Terrestrial ants were sampled by using bait traps and/or nest sampling at preselected <b>sites</b> in Argentina <b>and</b> Brazil. The sampling included the genera Solenopsis, Pheidole, Camponotus, Crematogaster, Linepithema, Brachymyrmex, Paratrechina, Dorymyrmex, and Wasmannia. The samples were examined under a phase-contrast microscope {{for the presence}} of microsporidian infections. The bait trap sampling revealed that: (1) T. solenopsae infected only S. richteri, S. invicta, and Solenopsis sp. at 6 – 67 % of <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> in 1. 5 – 29 % of the traps; (2) V. invictae infected only S. invicta at 6 % of <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> in 3 % of the samples. The nest sampling revealed that: (1) T. solenopsae infected S. invicta, S. richteri, and S. macdonaghi, at 41 – 67 % of <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> in 11 – 58 % of the colonies; (2) V. invictae infected the same species at 15 – 50 % of <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> in 2 – 26 % of the colonies. We detected T. solenopsae and V. invictae in equal percentages of S. invicta sites (41 %); however, the percentage of colonies infected with V. invictae was 20 % and with T. solenopsae only 11 %. At S. richteri sites, in contrast, T. solenopsae occurred at 46 % of <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> 15 % of the colonies and V. invictae occurred at only 15 % of <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> 2 % of the colonies. In S. macdonaghi, T. solenopsae was detected at 67 % of <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> 58 % of the colonies, and V. invictae was detected at 50 % of <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> 26 % of the colonies. This is the first report of V. invictae infecting S. macdonaghi. The proportion of S. richteri and S. invicta infected with T. solenopsae was similar.
