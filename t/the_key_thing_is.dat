40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{analysis}} of unemployment in the Czech regions. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> the {{effort to create a}} simple model which determinates unemployment in regions. To this, three basic factors are used - inflation, outcome and criminality as they represent fiscal, monetary and social policies. Firstly, the effects of these factors are tested separately by OLS to find their mutual correlation. The average effects of dependence between factors and unemployment in regions are also established by using panel regression. Original and static Phillip's curves are used to measure the impact of level of unemployment on the inflation. The expanded model of Phillip's curve and the dynamic model of natural level of unemployment are used to estimate natural levels of unemployment in regions. The difference version of Okun's law is used to estimate the impact of economy outcome on the level of unemployment. Subsequently, the extended model of Okun's law is used to distinguish the effect of economic cycle on this impact. Correlation of level of unemployment with criminality is measured by simple model, where the change of the first variable is determined by the change of the second variable. All this knowledge is used to create the complex model, which explains the change of the level of unemployment in [...] ...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} 1. The Synoptic Translation Prototype as {{a practical}} solution to the Tophoven version of transparency as ethical accountability : potential possibility to ‘reanimate’ translation processes to ‘watch them happen’ [...] . however, there exists the opposite ethical concern of a right to privacy for translators and their processes 2. The conceptual/theoretical apparatus of ethical/strategic layers. Firstly, dealing only with the usual specialist translation ethics of relative fidelity etc., it allows a text to be conceived as having different layers that can be treated separately and according to different strategic and ethical criteria, based on their different skopoi. Secondly, {{it is crucial to}} the theory that translation (whether or not specialised, though it is much clearer in specialised translation) is always dealing with ethical realms that are not specific to translation. So, you can also create a ‘layer’ or ‘layers’ for revisions/adaptations based upon ‘external’ ethical concerns (medical, journalistic, legal, intercultural, etc.). These can be organised according to a hierarchy based upon a synthetic skopos (itself obviously subject to ethical criteria). 3. A combination of the above means that the STP could provide multidimensional visualisation and searchability of translation databases, which are traces of multiple versions and translation possibilities, altered over time. It presently allows static visualisation (with dynamic and modifiable interaction between the original and a chosen version), but in the future might even be programmed to animate time-lapsed translation procedures, thus adding a fourth dimension. 4. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that the STP is designed as a tool for translation practice, not primarily for ethical oversight of translation (though the Tophoven angle means that it could well be used for this). The idea, though, with regard to ethics, is that it can be adapted as a pedagogical or working tool to heighten translators’ awareness of particular ‘ethical layers’ in practice...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} how Sweden {{relates to}} {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) in the construction process. LCA means analyzing a products impact and the analysis includes the whole life span of the product. A building has a high complexity and the combination with its unique shape will make the LCA more comprehensive, unlike e. g. aluminum cans. Recently {{there has been a}} development of a working procedure in the construction industry. This method is called BIM which means building information modelling and <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to gather all the information of the building in the same model. The benefits by using BIM are that a lot of double work is minimized and different involved stakeholders can take part of the model and work in the same model. The purpose with the thesis is to contribute to a more sustainable design through increased use of LCA. The aim has been to study the opportunities of integration between LCA and BIM, and also study the opportunities of making the procedure more efficient. Firstly a study has been done concerning whether how LCA is performed in Sweden and what problems there are concerning the making of a LCA in the construction sector. Next step was to find the benefits with BIM that reduce the problems. The thesis questions have been answered with mainly a literature study and a few interviews. The last question, considered as the main question, has also been answered with a case study. The case study includes an attempt of making an LCA on a part of the building of Jönköping University, School of Engineering by using BIM. The result shows that there is barely anyone that is performing LCA on buildings in Sweden today. LCA is performed when there is a demand from clients, but it is rarely. The knowledge of LCA is therefore poor and there are no standard methods. The results from the analysis of buildings today are not reliable. BIM facilitates the performance of LCA in several ways, but the problems with unreliable results remains. Linking the analysis to BIM makes an awareness of sustainability in an early stage, which can be considered more important than getting a correct result. BIM gives us the opportunity to save time in a time consuming procedure and hopefully contributing to a reliable result. This could be seen as {{a step in the right}} direction towards a sustainable development. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The problem being tackled here {{relates to}} the problem of target {{tracking}} in wireless sensor networks. It is a specific problem in localization. Localization primarily refers to the detection of spatial coordinates of a node or an object. Target tracking deals with finding spatial coordinates of a moving object and being able to track its movements. In the tracking scheme illustrated, sensors are deployed in a triangular fashion in a hexagonal mesh such that the hexagon is divided into a number of equilateral triangles. The technique used for detection is the trilateration technique in which intersection of three circles is used to determine the object location. While the object is being tracked by three sensors, distance to it from a fourth sensor is also being calculated simultaneously. The difference is that closest three sensors detect at a frequency of one second while the fourth sensor detects the object location at twice the frequency. Using the distance information from the fourth sensor and a simple mathematical technique, location of object is predicted for every half second as well. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>thing</b> to note <b>is</b> that the forth sensor node is not used for detection but only for estimation of the object at half second intervals and hence does not utilize much power. Using this technique, tracking capability of the system is increased...|$|R

At {{the beginning of}} the match he can imitate wild animals in a choreographed dance, and he sings songs to encourage his wrestler. The name [...] "zasuul" [...] comes from the Mongolian word [...] "zasah" [...] (to fix). There are usually two zasuuls for a bout for each wrestler. Their job is to analyze the match, to make sure there are no illegal moves, good sportsmanship and decide which wrestler went down first if there is a close call and be impartial for the whole match. If there is a disagreement on who fell first, they sometimes decide to rematch the wrestlers again. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>thing</b> for them <b>is</b> that they are not wrestlers on the field and really have no preference on who wins or loses the match, but to be impartial and represent the crowd and be representative of the rule of the game. Sometimes during the heat of the match, they also serve as third force so the matches go according to the rules and wrestlers win and lose accordingly. If there is a close call on who fell first, if there is a disagreement between the zasuuls, the match is usually redone if there was no video replay. If both zasuuls are confident on who fell first, the match is decided and declared over even if the fallen wrestler disputes the decision. Since Mongolian wrestling falls are sometimes close and hard to observe from afar because of the techniques involved, their primary role is to impartially decide from a third vantage point who fell first.

Reynolds	Now your research - you have a number of different client groups. Just explain what those are? Muliokela	Our clients in Zambia - Zambia has six hundred and three thousand farmers. We reach all of them through the information we produce. We reach them through extension, we reach them through the radio, we reach them through publications and so forth. But we want to concentrate basically on the two hundred thousand, the most viable ones, and who think that they would benefit by having additional technology to make them a little bit more proficient in their production. Reynolds	But I see that among your list of research activities conservation tillage is one of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> areas that you?re doing. Now to my mind and I?m sure many other listeners, conservation tillage smacks of subsistence farming, very low input, not really the commercial farmer that you say has potential for increasing agricultural production? Muliokela	One of the inputs of one of the characters of conservation farming is that you want to make the land more sustainable. So it doesn?t matter whether you are a commercial farmer or a small farmer you must adopt practices which would allow you to ensure that your land remains sustainable every year. And then secondly we believe in this country and many developing countries the issue of input costs is a very big issue. So conservation tillage among other activities seeks to promote cost effective technologies without compromising yields. Reynolds	Is there a role for bio-technology in low cost efficient agricultural production that?s applicable here in Zambia? Muliokela	In fact that?s where it comes in. The challenges of agricultural production in developing countries including Zambia is that we are inefficient producers. Inefficient from different ways. Some of the varieties are low yielding. Some of them are outdated. Some of them don?t respond to technology. So biotech, when they package up all these good varieties or packages in such a way that they make farming efficient, has a very big role. There is no substitute for it, we need to have it. Reynolds	So you?re thinking in terms of disease, virus free, planting material? what sort of biotech are you thinking of? Muliokela	There are several technologies for example there?s a controversy now on genetically modified maize. If you look at what has been genetically modified in some cases they modify the crop to be tolerant to weedicides which makes weed application much more efficient and timely. Sometimes they genetically modify a particular crop to be tolerant or resistant to stock borer. And then of course you are talking about rapid multiplication systems for crops like cassava, for bananas, for Irish potatoes, for sweet potatoes. So the scope is vast. Reynolds	But you wouldn?t turn your back on GM crops? Muliokela	No. Reynolds	Do you have any here? Muliokela	I think Zambia has a stand but we don?t have any here. But as a scientist, I?ve no quarrel with genetically modified, you know, good crops. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> really <b>the</b> GMO debate must go back to the concept of biosafety which says if you have to give me a GM in a crop I must have a prior consent, that?s number one. You must tell me what is that GMO, what is the constitution. And then secondly I must have a competent authority to handle these. That?s the problem here, Zambia has no competent authority. And it?s not only Zambia but I think there are many countries within the region. And so the safest route is to say we don?t need it. But to me the best route would have been to say let us establish a competent authority to deal with biotech outputs and see how to best handle them. Reynolds	Ten years time, if agriculture here in Zambia goes in the direction you would like to see it give me a breakdown of what those six hundred thousand farming families are going to be doing? Muliokela	What is going to happen is that the two hundred thousand farmers who are more or less hobby farmers or destitute farmers will be disappeared. They will have a much more smaller farming population but very efficient, biotech inclined They will not shy away from new technologies, they will go out and espouse it. And I?ve yet to see a country with so much tremendous potential like Zambia. I?ve travelled 70 countries, I?ve yet to see one with a tremendous potential like Zambia. Zambia really is just heaven on earth, we simply need to unlock its energies. End of tape.
