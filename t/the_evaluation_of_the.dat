5|$|After SS-3s March 1911 launch, Whitehead's {{tried to}} sell SS-3 to the Austro-Hungarian Navy, but because <b>the</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first two U-5-class boats was still underway, they {{declined}} to purchase. Over {{the next three years}} Whitehead's attempted to sell the boat to the navies of Peru, Portugal, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Bulgaria, before the Austro-Hungarian Navy rejected an offer for the second time. With the outbreak of war, however, the Austro-Hungarian Navy purchased the unsold submarine to quickly bolster its fleet.|$|E
5|$|After U-3s {{arrival at}} Pola in January 1909, she was {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 12 September 1909 as SM U-3. During <b>the</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U-3 class {{conducted by the}} Navy, the class' poor diving and handling characteristics were noted. To alleviate the diving problems, U-3s fins were changed in size and shape several times, and eventually, the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull. U-3 served as a training boat between 1910 and 1914 and made as many as ten cruises per month in that capacity.|$|E
5|$|The third boat, {{originally}} named SS-3, {{was built}} on speculation entirely at Whitehead's in Fiume. The boat's design featured improvements in the electrical and mechanical systems. Gibson and Prendergast report that, when built, SS-3 was powered by electric motors for both surface and submerged running. When the surface performance of the electric motors proved disappointing in trials, SS-3s power-plant was rebuilt to match the gasoline/electric combination used in U-5 and U-6. SS-3 was launched in March 1911 and was offered to the Austro-Hungarian Navy, but because <b>the</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first two U-5-class boats was still underway, they declined to purchase.|$|E
