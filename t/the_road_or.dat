5|$|Originally planned as a new-build route across South London, {{construction}} of {{the first section of}} the South Circular near Eltham began in 1921 to a high-quality specification. The remainder of the road was supposed to be of a similar standard but it was repeatedly delayed, and the current route was allocated in the late 1930s to existing urban streets instead. Despite several proposals to either upgrade <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>or</b> replace it with a parallel motorway, there has been little change in the century since the route was first planned and most of the road is still urban streets. The South Circular has received sustained criticism for congestion and pollution {{and is one of the}} least popular roads in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The defense {{maintained}} that the evidence against Desha was largely circumstantial. They said that Desha's personal items {{could easily have been}} planted where they were found. They pointed out that, despite the stab wounds on Baker's body, no blood was found on the ground near <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>or</b> on the path along which the murderer had dragged the body to conceal it. Finally, they contended that, although the days had been unusually warm and wild boars were known to inhabit the area, Baker's body showed no obvious signs of decomposition or disturbance by animals, as might have been expected had it been there for six days, as the prosecution had charged.|$|E

5|$|The {{player is}} often {{encouraged}} {{to take advantage of}} environmental light sources and placing, and to use other light-based weapons and accessories, such as flare guns, hand-held flares and flashbangs. Wake can use searchlights to take out massive waves of Taken. Streetlights and other light stands can provide a safe haven, which the Taken cannot enter, and will regenerate the character's health faster. Otherwise, health regenerates slowly with time, when not taking any damage. In certain sections of the game, it is possible to use a car to traverse between locations in Bright Falls. When in a car, the player can run down Taken on <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>or</b> boost the vehicle's headlights to destroy them.|$|E
5|$|Continuing their charge after McCausland's Brigade, the Union cavalry charged {{into the}} camp of the 16th Virginia Cavalry, which fled without resisting. Conger's 3rd West Virginia turned eastward and pursued rebels fleeing east {{down the road}} to Wardensville and Winchester. The 17th Virginia Cavalry was camped near some woods east of the main road, and had more time to prepare for the attack. They formed a battle line while three {{companies}} waited behind a fence. Initially, they repulsed Conger's men, forcing them to retreat. However, Conger was soon reinforced by Colonel Powell and the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, which was commanded by Colonel Henry Capehart. The two regiments charged the Virginians and drove them down <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>or</b> into the woods. During this time, Conger was killed by a lieutenant from the 17th Virginia. The Virginian was wearing a blue coat that fooled Conger into thinking he was from Conger's regiment. The two West Virginia regiments continued to pursue the Confederates down the road, and captured McCausland's two pieces of artillery. Eventually, some of the fleeing rebels ran into Major Work's 22nd Pennsylvania, and had to scatter to the woods. Work's men captured 34 of them.|$|E

25|$|While to {{some extent}} his work {{consisted}} in improving the designs of his predecessors, Holden was responsible for several designs of his own. He completely reorganised Stratford Works, which, together with a considerable degree of standardisation, brought Stratford to an exceptionally high position among British locomotive works in the speed and efficiency of its locomotive production. Some of the extensively-built locomotive classes {{may not have been}} outstanding in performance on <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>or</b> in fuel economy, but they were rugged in design and with their massive working parts were reliable and easy to maintain.|$|E
25|$|Most of Hopper's figure {{paintings}} {{focus on}} the subtle interaction of human beings with their environment—carried out with solo figures, couples, or groups. His primary emotional themes are solitude, loneliness, regret, boredom, and resignation. He expresses the emotions in various environments, including the office, in public places, in apartments, on <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>or</b> on vacation. As if he were creating stills for a movie or tableaux in a play, Hopper positioned his characters {{as if they were}} captured just before or just after the climax of a scene.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, cycling was in a poor state in Belgium. Velodromes were closing and national championships on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>or</b> track were no longer organised. The one major Belgian race, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, was in the French-speaking South. As the gloom increased, Odile Defraye became the first Belgian winner of the Tour de France in 1912. He was a 20-year old Fleming and, although he rode for Alcyon, a French team, he symbolized a potential rise for Belgian cycling. Defraye's victory inspired August De Maeght, mayor of Halle and director of the press group Société Belge d'Imprimerie, to publish a Dutch-language sports magazine called Sportwereld.|$|E

25|$|Locomotives used {{bells and}} steam {{whistles}} from {{earliest days of}} steam locomotion. In the United States, India and Canada, bells warned of a train in motion. In Britain, where all lines are by law fenced throughout, bells were only a requirement on railways running on a road (i.e. not fenced off), for example a tramway {{along the side of}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>or</b> in a dockyard. Consequently, only a minority of locomotives in the UK carried bells. Whistles are used to signal personnel and give warnings. Depending on the terrain the locomotive was being used in, the whistle could be designed for long-distance warning of impending arrival, or for more localised use.|$|E
25|$|During design, planning, {{maintenance}} and construction, metric is used. As a result, (and anticipating that the roadsigns themselves {{will one day}} be changed to display in metric units) recently erected signs are increasingly being placed at metric intervals but display an imperial unit as required by the current road-signage rules. For example, a 110yd marker might actually be placed at the 100m distance. Since 2008, location marker posts have appeared on motorways and major A roads in England, situated generally at intervals of 500 metres (though the dimension is not given). These repeat the information given on the co-sited surveyors' marker post which, since the 1960s, have reported distances on such roads in kilometres from a datum—usually the start of <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>or</b> the planned start-point of the road.|$|E
25|$|A {{route is}} {{referred}} to by its route number and name (for example, 115 Silver Hills). The route is usually named after <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>or</b> community that it primarily serves, though there are few that do not accurately represent the route (a comparatively short section of Route 109 Ranee for example serves Ranee Avenue in the Yorkdale neighbourhood in North York); a branch route is denoted by a letter after the original number (for example, 52A Lawrence West). A branch route travels in the same street and direction as the trunk route but will take a slightly different routing and/or have different terminals. All of the TTC's regular routes, except for two (99 Arrow Road and 171 Mt. Dennis, which serve their respective bus garages), connect to a subway station.|$|E
