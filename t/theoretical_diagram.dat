40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the effect of {{different}} steam explosion treatments on the thermal degradation of a bleached cellulose. The intensity of a steam explosion treatment, which allows breakdown of the structural lignocellulosic material was determined by a correlation between time and temperature of the process. Results of this study showed that thermal degradation of cellulose fibres was limited when the severity factor applied was below 4. 0. For higher intensities, determination of the degradation products in the water-soluble extract showed an important increase of the 5 -hydroxymethyl-furfural concentration with the temperature. When the severity factor reached 5. 2., TGA analysis showed that the increase of degradation products was coupled to an increase of the char level meaning a strong degradation of the cellulose. dTGA behaviour also showed that thermal stability of the steam explosion samples decreased with the intensity of the treatment.

The aim of {{this paper}} is twofold: (a) to determine the reliability of infrared (IR) emission to trace star formation in individual star-forming sites of M 33, and (b) to outline a new method for testing the distribution function of massive stars in newly formed clusters. Methods. We select 24 µm IR sources from the Spitzer survey of M 33 with Hα counterparts and show that the IR luminosities have a weak dependence on galactocentric radius. The IR and Hα luminosities are not correlated. Complementing the infrared photometry with GALEX-UV data, we estimate the bolometric luminosities to investigate how they are related to the Hα luminosities. We simulate a <b>theoretical</b> <b>diagram</b> for the expected bolometric-to-Hα luminosity ratio, Lbol/LHα, of young clusters {{as a function of the}} cluster luminosity. We then compare the observed Lbol/LHα ratios with the theoretical predictions. Results. In the log(Lbol) –log(Lbol/LHα) plane, stellar clusters should be born along a curve that we call the cluster birthline. The birthline depends on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) at the high-mass end, but not on the cluster mass function. For an upper stellar mass limit of 120 M⊙, the birthline is flat for Lbol> 3 × 10 39 erg s − 1 because all clusters fully sample the IMF. It increases toward lower luminosities as the upper end of the IMF becomes incompletely sampled. Aging moves clusters above the birthline. The observations of M 33 show that young isolated clusters lie close to the theoretical birthline for a wide range of Lbol. The observe...|$|E

40|$|In the {{economic}} and energetic context of our society, it is universally recognized that an alternative to fossil fuels and oil based product will be needed in the nearest future. A potential solution is to develop second generation biofuel and biobased product that utilizes non-food plant materials. The major component of these materials is lignocellulose, which is a complex composed by widely available biological polymers such as cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. This thesis {{is a part of}} this approach and is focused on a well-define part of these materials: the cellulose. The first part of this work was focused on the impact of two pretraitements (steam explosion and homogenization) on physico-chemical properties and hydrolysis yield of pure cellulose fiber. In contrast with literature, results obtained showed that moderate steam explosion treatments did not appear to improve the enzymatic hydrolysis yield of the cellulose fibers. In Parralel, a model that predicts the effect of the intensity of the steam explosion treatment in correlation with temperature and time was assessed.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of superconductivity in the two-leg ladder compound BaFe$_ 2 $S$_ 3 $ has established the 123 -type iron chalcogenides as a novel and interesting subgroup of the iron-based superconductors family. However, in this 123 series, BaFe$_ 2 $Se$_ 3 $ is an exceptional member, with a magnetic order and crystalline structure {{different from all}} others. Recently, an exciting experiment reported the emergence of superconductivity in BaFe$_ 2 $Se$_ 3 $ at high pressure [J. -J. Ying, et al., Phys. Rev. B 95, 241109 (R) (2017) ]. In this publication, we report {{a first principles study}} of BaFe$_ 2 $Se$_ 3 $. Our analysis unveils a variety of qualitative differences between BaFe$_ 2 $S$_ 3 $ and BaFe$_ 2 $Se$_ 3 $, including in the latter an unexpected chain of transitions with increasing pressure. First, by gradually reducing the tilting angle of iron ladders, the crystalline structure smoothly transforms from Pnma to Cmcm at ~ 6 GPa. Second, the system becomes metallic at 10. 4 GPa. Third, its unique ambient pressure Block antiferromagnetic ground state is replaced by the more common CX antiferromagnetic order at ~ 12 GPa, the same magnetic state of the 123 -S ladder. This transition is found at a pressure very similar to the experimental superconducting transition. Finally, all magnetic moments vanish at 30 GPa. This reported <b>theoretical</b> <b>diagram</b> of the complete phase evolution is important because of the technical challenges to capture many physical properties in high-pressure experiments. The information obtained in our calculations suggest different characteristics for superconductivity in BaFe$_ 2 $Se$_ 3 $ and BaFe$_ 2 $S$_ 3 $: in 123 -S pairing occurs when magnetic moments vanish, while in 123 -Se the transition region from Block- to CX-type magnetism appears to catalyze superconductivity.

40|$|Mr. NISHIMURA {{has pointed}} out in his report that we have become able to know {{underwater}} distribution of tunas. The author on board the Nagasaki-Maru engaged in tuna long-line fishing in the South China Sea and in the waters off the Palau Is., in January, June and December 1961. The author tried to record the underwater formation of the long-line {{by means of the}} fish finder obtaining succcessful records as shown in PL. Ⅲ-Fig. 1 in June and analysable dater in December for the first time. Using those records in December, the author calculated the resistance of water against the long-line. From the result of calculation, the author believes that the echo-sounding is the most reliable method to verify the underwater formation of long-line and the distribution of tuna. The available range of the fish-finder, however, is rather limited, and the long-line can not be recorded in many cases by it as the long-line is often moved out of the signal range by currents and other factors, especially on rough sea. Factors affecting the depth of hooks 1. Design of the long-line, the longer the main line, branch lines and float lines are designed, the deeper the hooks sink. 2. Amount of slack allowed during setting-down of line, The larger the distances between each buoy become, the deeper the hooks sink. 3. Effects of current and wind, The stronger the current and wind flow, the shallower the hooks become. Variation of hook-depth after setting-down of line ﻿Fig. 1 is the diagrm in which those records show the sinking stages of the deepest part of main line. Half an hour after setting-down of long-line, the main line usually sinks to a maximum catenary depth of 100 m, and after one hour, it becomes perfectly balanced. <b>Theoretical</b> <b>diagram</b> of vertical distribution of the gear 1. In case of no effect from current and wind According to reports by YOSHIHARA (1951), MORITA (1955), HAMURO and ISHII (1961) and J. J. GRAHAM (1958), they have all agreeded thet the underwater condition of tuna long-line indicates a catenary curve with any effect from external force. Fig. 2 shows the scale graph of a tuna long-line used by the Nagasaki-Maru. The condition of the main line differs according to the distance between buoys. The actual hook-depth is equal to the sum of the values of the branch line setting-point, length of buoy line and the branch line, i. e., y=a. cosh・x/a, 1 / 2 of total length of main line= 1 / 2 of buoy distances+(1 / 2 buoy dist.) 3 / 6 a 2 2.

From the result of analysis conducted in December 3 1961 in the waters off the Palau Is., the author found the amount of external force against long-line in the water. As shown in Fig. 5 and PL IV-Fig. 4, the long-line has been affected by an external force from horizontal right angle direction to the buoy formation. In this case, the speed of external force is 0. 2 kuot. 2.

40|$|Is it {{possible}} to affirm that SMEs present attributes that facilitate (respective to large-scale firms) the adoption of CSR and sustainability strategies? Does {{a positive relationship between}} the adhesion to a culture of social responsibility and evolved systems of governance and accountability exist? Does the entrepreneur’s orientation depend on contextual factors, such as the socio-economic and cultural environment in which the firm exists? To answer these questions, the study utilizes a deductive and inductive perspectives of analysis. The central hypothesis is that the entrepreneur’s ethical framework depends both on personal values as well as on a synthesis of socio-cultural, anthropological and environmental factors. The work is divided into three main sections. The first one presents the theoretical framework synthesizing the existent contributions on corporate social responsibility and sustainability in SMEs and on ethics and values of the small entrepreneur, with a particular emphasis on the theory of entrepreneurial social success. The second part describes and interprets the principle findings that emerged from a qualitative study of an Italian “cohesive” SME (BoxMarche Spa) in which the tie between mission, corporate governance and socially responsible management practices was examined. BoxMarche is an exemplary case of best practices of CSR belonging to the Marches, an Italian region which is characterized by a dense fabric of entrepreneurship and districts. The last section closes the paper with concluding remarks providing some preliminary considerations on the issue from a specific small-enterprise perspective that can be taken into consideration for future research. The empirical study was developed through a qualitative research approach focus on the case study method which has the intent to develop propositions aimed at enriching further theoretical and empirical researches. The usefulness of the case studies also resides in the possibility of valorizing the experiences of entrepreneurs who are “champions” of corporate social responsibility and of recognizing the merit of people and businesses who teach them, while not undervaluing the possibility of a path toward CSR that starts “at the base” and is connected to the territory, favoring the application of best practices. Specifically, the case method constitutes a valuable instrument for “capturing” the diverse manifestations of socially responsible government and of stakeholder relationships, and for utilizing the results to attain cognitive aims and normative substance. The study first attempted to identify the central value present in the company, its translation into a mission and, consequently, its impact on relationships with stakeholders, its reflections on the structure of governance, and the presence of instruments of accountability. The key attributes were analyzed by adopting an interpretative plan that focused on the vision, values and commitment of management and a <b>theoretical</b> <b>diagram</b> was employed to identify the most relevant aspects of a “spirited business” (Lamont 2002). The approach also implied the need to identify those aspects of the system of governance in SMEs that draw on the positive actions comprising the behavioral models of firms that achieve a stable and structured approach to CSR and sustainability incorporated in the firm’s own strategic orientation, in its underlying mode of governance and in its system of internal and external reporting. Secondly, the analysis set out to trace the specific factors that interacted with the territorial context of the chosen firm. The propositions derived from the study are the following: Proposition one: CSR reinforces and facilitates the convergence between mission, governance, and accountability. Proposition two: Among SMEs, the orientation toward CSR begins with the entrepreneur and is a manifestation of both the values tied to the entrepreneur’s personal goals as well as the values tied to cultural and social variables in the territory from which s/he comes. In the SMEs where CSR is a characteristic trait of the corporate culture, the consensus of the owner-entrepreneur/top management and the focus on referents at the base of decisions characterize systems of corporate governance that are more transparent and “harmonized” and that reinforce the organizational cohesion, the business climate, and the trust factor. In addition to applying formal methodologies, these businesses are able to devise effective ways of engaging and relating to stakeholders, “grasping their essence,” pinpointing expectations, offering solutions, and creating cohesion around projects and values of ample breadth. They are testimonies of entrepreneurial passion; they are given organizational strength and intangible riches. There are essentially three strong points of the Marchegian SMEs of which BoxMarche is representative: deep territorial roots, familial synergies, and tenacity. The first of these, which finds expression in the adhesion to, and social consensus of, the territory, is an emblematic aspect of the Marches, part of the region’s genius loci. The case considered presents clear signs of that genius, which is marked by a work ethic, a strong sense of being an active member of a community in which each person rediscovers the pleasure and the usefulness of working with trust. The profile of “convivial enterprise” that emerge correspond not to a codified managerial model, but to a business “way of being. ” Conviviality is not merely a feeling; it is an operative practice for organization and governance. In such contexts, in the absence of rigid forms of hierarchical coordination, the capacity of individual initiative remains vibrant. Convivial and territorial SMEs are those characterized by an active involvement in local development, because the business’ success issues from the same steps as the success of the territory. This translates into the creation of networks among local stakeholders: other businesses, public institutions, chambers of commerce, trade associations, banks, non-profit and citizen organizations—which all become nodes of a cooperative network whose end is to develop the territory. The socio-economic texture, defined in terms of “social capital,” social capabilities or civic-ness, is enriched by values, cultures and traditions tied to a specific community-space. It is therefore important to look also at those intangible factors that favor the development of CSR and to the sustainability of the SME. The Marchegian model of sustainable development that appeals to the territory’s businesses is premised on a challenge: the capacity of the whole productive, associative, unionized, entrepreneurial and institutional world to act and to be made to act in socially responsible ways, and thus to be territorially characterized in a unified sense. Thus, another development in the CSR debate can consider the following question: “Do best practices of CSR increase the social capital of the territory?” If so, then what role do SMEs play in constructing the structural components of the territory? The concept of Territorial Social Responsibility has not been adequately studied. Social responsibility of the territory is founded, therefore, on the rediscovery of shared values that the territory’s economic, social and institutional actors know how to reinforce, thanks to solid networks of relationships. The best practices of socially oriented Marchegian SMEs contribute to a model of territorial development rooted in the region’s particular socio-economic context...|$|E

Simultaneously, we test the current calibrations of Te and luminosity for the Ap/Bp star members, and identify clearly blue stragglers in the clusters studied. Methods: We explore the possibility that isochrone fitting in the <b>theoretical</b> Hertzsprung-Russell <b>diagram</b> (i. e. log (L/L&sun;) vs. log Te), rather than in the conventional colour-magnitude diagram, can provide more precise and accurate cluster ages, with well-defined uncertainties. Results: Well-defined ages are found for all the clusters studied. For the nearby clusters studied, the derived ages are not very sensitive to the small uncertainties in distance, reddening, membership, metallicity, or choice of isochrones. Our age determinations are all within the range of previously determined values, but the associated uncertainties are considerably smaller than the spread in recent age determinations from the literature. Furthermore, examination of proper motions and HR diagrams confirms that the Ap stars identified in these clusters are members, and that the presently accepted temperature scale and bolometric corrections for Ap stars are approximately correct. We show that in these <b>theoretical</b> HR <b>diagrams</b> blue stragglers are particularly easy to identify.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} regime diagrams {{illustrating the}} parametric dependence of dynamical balance in a superrotating atmosphere produced in a quasi-axisymmetric idealized system with strong horizontal diffusion studied previously {{by the present}} authors. In this system, the superrotation is maintained by the Gierasch mechanism, which possibly explains the four-day circulation in the atmosphere of Venus. Our previous paper developed a theoretical model of this system to estimate the superrotation strength and showed that the parametric dependence of the superrotation strength can be consolidated into three non-dimensional external parameters. The present study analyzes the theoretical model to determine boundaries of the regimes based on the dynamical balance and plots <b>theoretical</b> regime <b>diagrams,</b> which are {{important to understand the}} non-linear dynamical system and are useful to clearly describe the parametric dependence. Further, a parametric limit of the theoretical model is also estimated and included in the diagrams. The parametric limit shows both a lower limit for the horizontal diffusion and an upper limit of the superrotation strength in the Gierasch mechanism. The regime diagram demonstrates that the superrotation in the cyclostrophic balance is realized when the horizontal Ekman number is in a certain range whose width is mainly controlled by the vertical Ekman number. Numerical solutions covering a vast region in the parameter space are obtained by time-integrations of the primitive equations, and the dynamical regimes in the numerical solutions are compared with the <b>theoretical</b> regime <b>diagrams.</b> The <b>theoretical</b> regime <b>diagrams</b> agree well with the numerical results in most regions, confirming the validity of the theoretical model. Multiple equilibrium solutions are obtained when the horizontal Ekman number is lower than the theoretical limit.

This includes, in particular, asymptotic trends and equilibria, whence fundamental diagrams originate. Comment: 14 page...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{establishes}} {{an original}} computation formula for the flow {{rate of the}} fluid transported by {{a new type of}} rotating machine with profiled rotors; the <b>theoretical</b> characteristic <b>diagram</b> of the machine- flow rate versus machine speed- is built. The scheme of the test stand used for performing measurements needed in order to build the experimental diagram is presented. The variation of the volumetric efficiency of the working machine in function of the machine speed is finally described...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{organization}} of ecological units that constitute river floodplains was modeled using a recent image synthesis method. The model combined a purely spatial process, the stochastic pyramid, with analytical descriptions of ecological successions observed on each landform of the fluvial landscape. Because the stochastic pyramid is a generator of non-homogeneous, anisotropic, multicolored and random patterns, based on concepts of mosaics, {{it could be}} articulated {{with a series of}} diagrams which related the seral successional states to the spatial configuration of ecological units. Modeling was performed in two steps. A priori probabilities were determined to transpose <b>theoretical</b> <b>diagrams</b> onto a processing image containing only the channel network of a real map; then after a random draw, a randomly textured image was obtained, this image was then transformed by the controlled stochastic pyramid {{in order to create a}} partition of wider regions without texture. As a result of this transformation, each colored pixel tended to expand and to incorporate its neighboring pixels that were randomly deleted. The model simulates various ecological maps of the same floodplain with both deterministic (fluvial network and ecological successions) and stochastic components (decimatio...|$|R
