5|$|The Jackson-Rowe {{friendship}} {{would last}} for several years, {{during which time}} Rowe married and divorced Richard Edelman, a man she claimed to have felt trapped by. Rowe and the musician would both talk <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>about</b> their unhappy marriages; his with Presley and hers with Edelman, a teacher at Hollywood High School. Like Jackson's first wife, Rowe supported the entertainer when {{he was accused of}} child sexual abuse. Jackson kept his friendship with Rowe a secret from his wife, who eventually found out but thought nothing of it; she felt the dermatologist's assistant was not her husband's type because she was not glamorous enough.|$|E

After Reina has her confession rejected by Souichi, she runs away and happens upon Keidai and the others.

They connect over their predicament of having romantic feelings for those who only see them as a younger sibling. Reina is later revealed to be the reincarnation of a girl named , a friend of Serena.

Ruby and Liam continue to act a support unit for one another. As the scholarship develops they talk <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>about</b> [...] "mature things that surpass a student-teacher relationship." [...] Liam later develops feelings for Bianca Scott (Lisa Gormley) and Ruby is seeing Liam slip from her grasp. Breeds said [...] "She sees them flirting {{and she has a}} moment where she realises that she's so in love with this guy and it's kind of now or never. She needs to take action."

500|$|The lyrics {{were written}} with Hoppus and DeLonge going into {{separate}} rooms—Hoppus writing the choruses and DeLonge writing the verses. The two {{had not spoken}} <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>about</b> the lyrics ahead of time, {{and it turned out}} that the two had both written about sex. When put together, the song represents the lustful side of sex during the verses, the passionate side in the bridge and the romantic side in the chorus, creating a juxtaposition between both voices. It has been interpreted as a description for failed romance, one that [...] "illustrates a scenario of lust, ambivalence and regret." [...] For Barker, the song's drum track was [...] "super in respect to John Bonham. [...] We were kind of messing around with the verse. It’s like, 'Well, I want to do a four-bar drum intro and just see how it works for the song.' And we never second-guessed it. We were like, 'That sounds rad.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Following the complaints, Fox removed {{any mention}} of Catholicism from the scene, {{resulting}} in the line [...] "The church..." [...] Scully was reportedly furious with Fox's actions. In an interview in Los Angeles Times, Scully said, [...] "people can say hurtful things <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>about</b> their weight, their race, their intelligence, their sexual preference, and that all seems up for grabs, {{but when you get}} into religion, some people get very nervous." [...] Marisa Guthrie of Boston Herald also criticized the network, describing it as [...] "caving in" [...] to the Catholic League's protests. She wrote, [...] "Hollywood has always been gun shy of controversy, but recent displays of self-censorship on the part of entertainment industry executives make us cringe [...] Granted Catholics, as a group have endured an ample amount of bashing, but The Simpsons is an equal opportunity offender." [...] Howard Rosenberg, a writer for Los Angeles Times, criticized Fox's actions as well. He argued that the network had a biased opinion towards Catholicism and that, had the scene mentioned a different religion, it would have been accepted. He also wrote, [...] "Given its famous flaunting of sleaze and death-defying motorcycle leaps, the big news here is that Fox has standards. Its latest production is Censors Who Kill Jokes." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{investigation}} {{found that the}} perpetrators were inspired by Islamic terrorists and terrorist organizations.

Comey said that they [...] "were talking <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>about</b> jihad and martyrdom," [...] before their engagement and {{as early as the}} end of 2013. They reportedly spent at least a year preparing for the attack, including taking target practice and making plans {{to take care of their}} child and Farook's mother. Comey has said that although the investigation has shown that the couple was radicalized and possibly inspired by foreign terrorist organizations, there is no indication that they were directed by such a group or part of a broader cell or network.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{predominant}} {{influences on}} Finland's geography were the continental glaciers that scoured and gouged the country's surface. When the glaciers receded about 10,000 years ago, {{they left behind}} [...] moraines, drumlins, and eskers. Other indications of their presence are the thousands of lakes they helped to form {{in the southern part}} of the country. The force of the moving ice sheets gouged the lake beds, and meltwaters helped to fill them. The recession of the glaciers is so recent (in geologic terms) that modern-day drainage patterns are immature and poorly established. The direction of glacial advance and recession set the alignment of the lakes and streams in a general northeast to southwest lineation. The two Salpausselkä Ridges, which run parallel <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>about</b> twenty-five kilometres apart, are the terminal moraines. At their greatest height they reach an elevation of about , the highest point in southern Finland.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{leaflets}} {{were seen}} as being an effective tactic in manipulating troops when morale was low, [...] "During {{the early months of}} the war, leaflets or pamphlets were scattered over enemy territory by aircraft and balloons {{but it was more than}} doubtful whether these had any useful effect, their obvious defects being that few can have reached their targets and, being printed, they were sometimes out of date by the time they were ready to distribute. The front-line distribution of leaflets was quite another matter and these were dropped by aircraft or fired by shells, the messages they bore being less careful about the general principles of consistency and frankness and only truthful about matters on which the enemy had contradictory information". It was found that psychological warfare was not effective when distributing surrender leaflets to an enemy which currently had a high morale amongst its troops. Despite the pitfalls to airborne leaflets ineffectiveness on opposing sides with high morale, enemies used this tactic [...] "to cause the men to begin talking <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>about</b> their poor military position, their desire to stay alive for their families' sakes, and the reasonableness of honorable surrender", which often led men to desert their troops.|$|E
