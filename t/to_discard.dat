5|$|After leaving school, Macartney {{worked for}} a fruit and {{vegetable}} merchant near Sydney's Sussex Street docks, honing his batting skills by practising without pads on a wooden wharf during his lunch break. At this stage in his career, he possessed a copybook technique and defensive style, something he was <b>to</b> <b>discard</b> for an audacious, self-styled and attacking outlook.|$|E
5|$|Many {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed for animal navigation: there is evidence {{for a number of}} them. Investigators have often been forced <b>to</b> <b>discard</b> the simplest hypotheses - for example, some animals can navigate on a dark and cloudy night, when neither landmarks nor celestial cues like sun, moon, or stars are visible. The major mechanisms known or hypothesized are described in turn below.|$|E
5|$|In early 1855, {{less than}} twenty years after the colony was founded, South Australia's first horse tram began {{operating}} between Goolwa and Port Elliot on the Fleurieu Peninsula. Just over twenty years later Adelaide became the first city in Australia to introduce horse trams, and eventually the last <b>to</b> <b>discard</b> them for more modern public transport. Although two trials of street level trains were run, the state of Adelaide's streets, with mud in winter and dust in summer, led to the decision {{that they would not}} be reliable.|$|E

5|$|Phillip Padgett (John Hawkes), {{a fledgling}} author, {{sits at a}} desk, {{suffering}} from writer's block. He eventually retires to the bathroom <b>to</b> <b>discard</b> a spent cigarette. Without warning or concern, the man suddenly reaches into his chest and removes a bloody heart. Later, he walks down metal stairs into a cluttered basement, {{and opens the door}} of an incinerator. Noticing a beating heart amidst the flames, and unfazed by the vision, he nonchalantly tosses in a paper bag.|$|E
5|$|You Only Live Twice is a 1967 British spy {{film and}} the fifth in the James Bond series to be {{produced}} by Eon Productions, starring Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. The film's screenplay was written by Roald Dahl, and loosely based on Ian Fleming's 1964 novel of the same name. It is the first James Bond film <b>to</b> <b>discard</b> most of Fleming's plot, using only a few characters and locations from the book as the background for an entirely new story.|$|E
5|$|At 1200, Mott {{was brought}} to the {{position}} of L Company commander Captain George F. Sharra. Mott ordered Sharra to take command and organize a retreat. Sharra ordered his three platoons to withdraw. A battalion of North Korean soldiers began moving down the pass towards the American positions. Men of I Company were forced to withdraw through rice paddies south of the pass, being strafed by mortar and machine gun fire in the process. They also had to cross a -wide stream in the retreat, and some drowned in the process. Most of the Americans were forced <b>to</b> <b>discard</b> weapons, equipment and clothing in the retreat. Many of the men of L Company, {{as well as some of}} the wounded, were able to evacuate by truck.|$|E
40|$|New points can be {{superimposed}} on a Euclidean configuration obtained {{as a result}} of a metric Multidimensional Scaling at coordinates given by Gower’s in-terpolation formula.

5|$|Governor Deane C. Davis of Vermont {{declared}} a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to assist with cleanup efforts. Blowing snow continuously blocked roads after being cleared, and snow removal vehicles, not equipped to withstand the excessive snow, began experiencing mechanical issues. The storm left some communities without power or telephone service for up to two days, although isolated outages persisted longer. One person died in Saxtons River. With roads impassable in both New York and New England, tank trucks could not reach dairy farmers, who were in some cases forced <b>to</b> <b>discard</b> thousands of gallons of milk. In other cases, power outages rendered equipment useless, requiring milking to be done manually. One person in New Hampshire died of exhaustion during the storm.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, it was {{reported}} that only 20% of the game was complete. Numerous features {{were not included in the}} final product due to time and budget constraints. The developers originally planned to add a special weapon designed to be used underwater and acquired from Chris at the end of the eight episode, but the plot of the game changed during development and the team had <b>to</b> <b>discard</b> it. Additionally, the land in the distance that can be seen from the ship in the first episode was originally going to be the setting of the last episode, where Jill would have found something from her past.|$|E
5|$|In June and July 1889, Don Juan d'Austria {{participated in}} fleet {{training}} exercises, which also included the ironclads Custoza, , Tegetthoff, Prinz Eugen, and Kaiser Max. During the 1893 fleet maneuvers, Don Juan d'Austria was mobilized to train alongside the ironclads , , Prinz Eugen, and Kaiser Max, among other vessels. A new construction {{program in the}} late 1890s and early 1900s required the Austro-Hungarian Navy <b>to</b> <b>discard</b> old, obsolete vessels to reduce annual budgets. These ships were largely reused in secondary roles. Don Juan d'Austria was stricken from the naval register on 29 June 1904 and converted into a barracks ship the following year. She was based in Pola and used by torpedo boat crews through World War I. The ship sank after the war in 1919 under unclear circumstances.|$|E
30|$|The {{problems}} {{discussed in}} Incremental SVM algorithm are how <b>to</b> <b>discarding</b> history samples optimally {{and how to}} selecting new training instances in successive learning procedure. But {{there is still some}} intrinsic difficulties. Firstly, Support vectors (SVs) is highly depended on kernel functions you selected. Secondly, when concept drift happens, previous support vectors could be useless.|$|R

5|$|One {{possibility}} is that the Dressel 20 amphora, the principal type found at Monte Testaccio, may have been unusually difficult to recycle. Many types of amphora could be re-used to carry {{the same type of}} product or modified to serve a different purpose—for instance, as drain pipes or flower pots. Fragmentary amphorae could be pounded into chips to use in opus signinum, a type of concrete widely used as a building material, or could simply be used as landfill. The Dressel 20 amphora, however, broke into large curved fragments that could not readily be reduced to small shards. It is likely that the difficulty of reusing or repurposing the Dressel 20s meant that it was more economical <b>to</b> <b>discard</b> them.|$|E
5|$|With {{the clear}} {{goal of a}} manned landing {{replacing}} the more nebulous goals of space stations and cislunar flights, NASA had to hit the ground running, and decided <b>to</b> <b>discard</b> the feasibility study designs of Convair, GE, and Martin, and proceed with Faget's command / service module design. The mission module {{was determined to be}} only useful as an extra room, and therefore deemed unnecessary. They used Faget's design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids in October 1961. On November 28, 1961, it was announced that North American Aviation had won the contract, although its bid was not rated as good as Martin's. Webb, Dryden and Robert Seamans chose it in preference due to North American's longer association with NACA.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} probe, The Voyage Home {{required}} no new starship designs. The USS Saratoga, the first Federation starship disabled by the probe, was the USS Reliant model from The Wrath of Khan. The Bird-of-Prey model from The Search for Spock was reused, but ILM built additional sturdy versions for The Voyage Homes action sequences. The {{inside of the}} Bird-of-Prey was represented by a different set than The Search for Spock, but the designers made sure to adhere to a sharp and alien architectural aesthetic. To give the set a smokier, atmospheric look, the designers rigged display and instrumentation lights to be bright enough that they could light the characters, {{rather than relying on}} ambient or rigged lighting. While Paramount had instructed ILM to trash the large Spacedock model created for The Search for Spock, the team had been loath <b>to</b> <b>discard</b> the complicated model and its miles of fiber optic lighting. When The Voyage Home called for the return of Spacedock, ILM had only to reassemble the model from storage.|$|E
5000|$|At {{any time}} during the round each player or team must <b>discard</b> two cards <b>to</b> the dealers crib. When this is done the player {{immediately}} plays the next card from their hand, if any remain, on the board. Once a player has <b>discarded</b> two cards <b>to</b> the crib their remaining cards must be played on the board in normal game play fashion. If a player or team waits until their last two cards are left prior <b>to</b> <b>discarding</b> <b>to</b> the crib, then these two cards must be placed in the crib.|$|R
40|$|New Hypothesis {{formation}} {{may be an}} analyst-initiated activity, {{an automated}} process whereby a novel trend is discovered and tracked, or a hybrid one. In the hybrid case, the system offers its discovery of novel, potentially interesting patterns for analyst review, leading to new hypothesis being formed and tracked, or <b>to</b> <b>discarding</b> the novelty as coincidental or uninteresting. The ARGUS project assumes the third paradigm, where a combination of analysis of massive data – both historical and real-time streams – leads to automated creation of potential hypothesis for analysts <b>to</b> consider, <b>discard,</b> embellish, combine, and/or instruct ARGUS to track as a new persistent interest profile...|$|R

5|$|Caltech {{is home to}} the 1.7-ton, 130-year-old Fleming Cannon. The {{origins and}} exact age of the Fleming Cannon are not known with certainty. It is {{believed}} to have been cast during the Franco-Prussian War era, but completed in 1878 after the war was over. It was then given by the French to the United States where it was re-bored to fit American shells and the carriage constructed, but this work was completed too late for it to see use in the Spanish–American War. The cannon soon became obsolete and was donated to Southwestern Academy in San Marino, California, where it was displayed on the front lawn starting in 1925. By 1972, the school was seeking <b>to</b> <b>discard</b> the cannon, and a group of Caltech students from Fleming House took possession of the cannon and laboriously restored it to working condition. The cannon was returned to Southwestern in 1975 at the insistence of the Caltech administration, but it was permanently restored to Caltech in 1981. The cannon is one of the few objects at Caltech which is designated as unprankable given its age, fragility, and irreplaceable nature.|$|E
5|$|During the 1893 fleet maneuvers, Kaiser Max was mobilized {{to train}} {{alongside}} the ironclads , , Prinz Eugen, and , among other vessels. A new construction {{program in the}} late 1890s and early 1900s required the Austro-Hungarian Navy <b>to</b> <b>discard</b> old, obsolete vessels to reduce annual budgets. These ships were largely reused in secondary roles. Kaiser Max was stricken from the naval register on 30 December 1904 and withdrawn from service. She was converted into a barracks ship and in 1909, assigned to Cattaro Bay to serve the Arsenal Teodo, where she remained through World War I. In 1920, having lost the war, the now-defunct Austro-Hungarian Empire ceded the ship to the newly formed Royal Yugoslav Navy. The ship's fate after entering Yugoslav service is unclear. She was renamed Tivat, according to Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships later became Neretva, serving through 1941; her ultimate fate after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941 is unknown. According to the naval historian Milan Vego, however, the Yugoslav Navy sold the ship for scrap in 1924.|$|E
5|$|During {{the design}} process, {{it was decided}} that the utmost concern was that the ships could be built quickly and placed into service. The ships were <b>to</b> <b>discard</b> the use of {{broadside}} belt armor below the waterline, the attachment of which was an extremely long process. It was believed that the higher speed of the class——would make up for the vulnerability to torpedo attack and make the armor unnecessary.The initial designs called for three main battery turrets, each mounting a pair of new 42cm guns, though this was later increased to four twin turrets. However, the work that would have been necessary to design and test the new turret clashed with U-boat construction, which had become the priority of the Navy. Krupp, the firm that had been awarded the contract to conduct the testing, informed the Reichsmarineamt (RMA—the Imperial Navy Office) that design work on the new turret would have to wait. Capelle accepted the news without much objection. Nevertheless, the ships were never built. The RMA filed a report dated 1 February 1918, which stated that capital ship construction had ground to a halt, primarily due to the shifting priorities to the U-boat war.|$|E
40|$|Societal demands <b>to</b> reduce <b>discarding</b> {{and other}} impacts {{associated}} with fishing are growing. Pressure is increasing on policy makers, fishermen and scientists to ‘do {{something about the}} discard problem’. Discarding is high on the agenda in the upcoming review of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and within the Commission, Member States and the fishing industry there is considerable discussion on appropriate management measures <b>to</b> mitigate <b>discarding.</b> In order <b>to</b> address the issue, fisheries should first be evaluated (audited) to identify the specific <b>discard</b> problems and <b>to</b> reference these against the available mitigation tools i. e. measures <b>to</b> reduce <b>discards.</b> This Atlas represents a first attempt at auditing Irish fisheries and proposes some options <b>to</b> mitigate <b>discards.</b> It should be emphasised that discarding occurs in all international fleets operating in the waters around Ireland and that mitigation measures must be applied to all these fleets {{if we are to}} implement a successful discard reduction policy...|$|R

5|$|Gorizia {{entered the}} dry dock in La Spezia to begin repairs on 4 May; {{she was still}} under repair when Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allies in September. The ship's commander initially ordered the caretaker crew to flood the drydock and scuttle the ship when German troops occupied the port, but cancelled the order {{when it became clear}} the ship would be of no use to the Germans anyway. The Germans later moved the ship out of the dock, anchored her in the harbor, and abandoned her. On the night of 2122 June 1944, British and Italian frogmen used Chariot manned torpedos to infiltrate the harbor to sink Gorizia and Bolzano to prevent the Germans from using them as blockships; while the commandos did sink Bolzano, they were unsuccessful with Gorizia. She remained afloat and heavily listing in April 1945, when Allied forces liberated La Spezia. Judged to be too badly damaged to repair, the postwar navy decided <b>to</b> <b>discard</b> the ship. She was accordingly stricken from the naval register on 27 February 1947 and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, Ruggiero di Lauria and her {{two sisters}} were joined in the Reserve Squadron by the three s and , three cruisers, and sixteen torpedo boats. This {{squadron}} only entered active service for two {{months of the year}} for training maneuvers, {{and the rest of the}} year was spent with reduced crews. During the annual training maneuvers in October 1906, a severe storm swept a man overboard, drowning him. During a gunnery competition held during the maneuvers, Ruggiero di Laurias gunners came in last place. In 1908, the Italian Navy decided <b>to</b> <b>discard</b> Ruggiero di Lauria and her sister Francesco Morosini. The former was stricken from the naval register on 11 November 1909. The ship was then converted into a floating oil depot. She was renamed GM45 and stationed at La Spezia until 1943, when she was sunk in shallow water by an air raid during World War II. Her wreck was scrapped after the end of the war in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Mercury {{and most}} of its {{compounds}} are extremely toxic and must be handled with care; in cases of spills involving mercury (such as from certain thermometers or fluorescent light bulbs), specific cleaning procedures are used to avoid exposure and contain the spill. Protocols call for physically merging smaller droplets on hard surfaces, combining them into a single larger pool for easier removal with an eyedropper, or for gently pushing the spill into a disposable container. Vacuum cleaners and brooms cause greater dispersal of the mercury and should not be used. Afterwards, fine sulfur, zinc, or some other powder that readily forms an amalgam (alloy) with mercury at ordinary temperatures is sprinkled over the area before itself being collected and properly disposed of. Cleaning porous surfaces and clothing is not effective at removing all traces of mercury and it is therefore advised <b>to</b> <b>discard</b> these kinds of items should they be exposed to a mercury spill.|$|E
