500|$|<b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Black</b> Police Association {{opposed the}} boycott of Time-Warner and {{the attacks on}} [...] "Cop Killer," [...] {{identifying}} police brutality {{as the cause of}} much anti-police sentiment, and proposed the creation of independent civilian review boards [...] "to scrutinize the actions of our law enforcement officers" [...] as a way of ending the provocations that caused artists such as Body Count [...] "to respond to actions of police brutality and abuse through their music. [...] Many individuals of the law enforcement profession do not want anyone to scrutinize their actions, but want to scrutinize the actions of others." [...] Critics argued that the song could cause crime and violence.

Ice-T is quoted as saying that [...] "I didn't need people to come in and really back me on the First Amendment. I needed people to come in and say 'Ice-T has grounds to make this record.'

500|$|By the album's release date, three singles {{had been}} released, [...] "Devil's Pie", [...] "Left & Right", and [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)", {{with only the}} latter making a {{significant}} commercial impact. The limited success with singles and lukewarm opinions from label executives led to more promotional efforts and a public response made by D'Angelo's management through issuing a statement, which cited Voodoo as the R musical equivalent of art rock band Radiohead's acclaimed studio album OK Computer (1997). While both records feature an experimental edge, in terms of sound and lyrical themes, the English indie rock scene to which the latter had belonged was album-oriented, {{as opposed to the}} contemporary R scene in the United States, which was more single-oriented at the time. Prior to its release, Virgin launched an extensive, multi-layered campaign for the album, which setup several promotional performances by D'Angelo in 1999, including a guest performance on the season premiere of The Chris Rock Show on September 17, New York's Key Club, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Black</b> Programmers Coalition meeting in New Orleans on November 20, KMEL San Francisco's House of Soul show on December 10, and KKBT L.A.'s Holiday Cooldown on December 11. Following commitments made by the label for the album's distribution in the UK, continental Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, D'Angelo appeared at London's Music of Black Origin Awards on October 6. Other promotional events included signings and in-store appearances by D'Angelo at shopping venues such as Macy's, Virgin Megastore, and Fulton Mall in New York City, which attracted a considerable number of D'Angelo's female fans. A remix album, Voodoo DJ Soul Essentials (2000), was also issued by Virgin.|$|E
