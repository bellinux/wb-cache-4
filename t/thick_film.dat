2500|$|The {{thermal noise}} of a {{practical}} resistor {{may also be}} larger than the theoretical prediction and that increase is typically frequency-dependent. Excess noise of a practical resistor is observed only when current flows through it. This is specified in unit of μV/V/decade – μV of noise per volt applied across the resistor per decade of frequency. [...] The μV/V/decade value is frequently given in dB so that a resistor with a noise index of 0dB exhibits 1 μV (rms) of excess noise for each volt across the resistor in each frequency decade. [...] Excess noise is thus an example of 1/f noise. [...] Thick-film and carbon composition resistors generate more excess noise than other types at low frequencies. Wire-wound and thin-film resistors are often used for their better noise characteristics. [...] Carbon composition resistors can exhibit a noise index of 0dB while bulk metal foil resistors may have a noise index of −40dB, usually making the excess noise of metal foil resistors insignificant. Thin film surface mount resistors typically have lower noise and better thermal stability than <b>thick</b> <b>film</b> surface mount resistors. Excess noise is also size-dependent: in general excess noise is reduced as the physical size of a resistor is increased (or multiple resistors are used in parallel), as the independently fluctuating resistances of smaller components tend to average out.|$|E

As the sintering temperature increased, the concentration of the metallic phase increased and spread throughout the film. A new Pb–Cu alloy phase was identified.
