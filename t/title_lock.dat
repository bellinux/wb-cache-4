50|$|Following {{the release}} of the {{original}} games, Mark released his next title, Band of Heroes, with the help of David Heath and Erik Rutins through Matrix Games. The game subsequently won historical game of the year at the 2005 Origins Awards. In 2006 Matrix and Mark parted ways, and Mark founded Lock 'n Load Publishing. The company's original <b>titles,</b> <b>Lock</b> 'n Load: Swift and Bold, World at War: Eisenbach Gap, and Lock 'n Load: Day of Heroes, were released within the year, and have subsequently sold through two printings.|$|R
50|$|After filming {{over an hour}} of footage, the {{producers}} Klaw and Erlanger abandoned the project during post-production, leaving the film to be without a <b>title</b> and <b>locked</b> away by the Biograph Film Studio.|$|R
5|$|In late 2003, {{following}} the commercial success achieved by 50 Cent's debut studio album Get Rich or Die Tryin, Interscope Records head Jimmy Iovine asserted that 50 Cent {{had a high}} enough profile to move into making films. Plans for a film were revealed the following year, when 50 Cent revealed {{that he would be}} writing and directing his first motion picture, a semi-autobiographical work based on his difficult childhood experiences, with the Oscar-nominated director Jim Sheridan assisting in the production of the film. The film was originally known under the <b>title</b> <b>Locked</b> and Loaded, although this later became Get Rich or Die Tryin. Get Rich or Die Tryin was released to cinemas in 2005, and received generally mixed reviews from contemporary film critics.|$|R

50|$|Once {{there was}} a writer named Drosselmeyer, who {{had the power to}} make his stories come to life. But he died before he could finish his final tale, The Prince and The Raven, leaving the two <b>title</b> {{characters}} <b>locked</b> in an eternal battle. After many years, the Raven managed to break free into the real world, and the Prince pursued him. To seal away the Raven's evil, Prince Mytho shattered his own heart with his sword, causing him to lose all his memories and emotions.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first-ever}} ECWHL playoffs, hosted at Boss Arena, Rhody {{was just as}} {{dominant}} as during its 8-0-0 league regular season, dispatching BU (7-2) and UMass (9-2) to win the <b>title</b> and <b>lock</b> down the national number three ranking into the ACHA National Tournament. Things started well in East Lansing, MI as URI took first in its pool and made the semifinals with decisive wins over West LA and Iowa State, before taking down MSU {{for the second time}} in 2003-04 during the final four round. The dream season - which resulted in a program-best 32 wins - came to a disappointing end one victory shy however, as Wisconsin topped the Rams 3-1 in the ACHA championship clash.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel state of electrons and phonons arising in semiconductor superlattices (SSL) due to strong electron-phonon interactions. These states {{are characterized by}} a localization of phonons and a self-trapping or locking of electrons in one or several quantum wells due to an additional, deformational potential arising around these locking wells in SSL. The effect is enhanced in a longitudinal magnetic field. Using the tight-binding and adiabatic approximations the whole energy spectrum of the self-trapped states is found and accurate, analytic expressions are included for strong electron-phonon coupling. Finally, we discuss possible experiments which may detect these predicted self-trapped states. Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures. Please note that the published article has the <b>title</b> 'Electron <b>locking</b> in layered structures by a longitudinal magnetic field...|$|R
50|$|Between 2007 and 2008, {{the genre}} became a phenomenon, {{due in part}} to the {{popularity}} of the tower defense mode in real time strategy games, but mainly due to the rise of Adobe Flash independent developers as well as the emergence of major smartphone app stores from Apple and Google. The first stand-alone browser games emerged in 2007. Among them were the extremely popular titles Flash Element Tower Defense released in January and Desktop Tower Defense released in March. Desktop Tower Defense earned an Independent Games Festival award, and its success led to a version created for the mobile phone by a different developer. Another significant Flash title released in 2008 was GemCraft. Handheld game console were not ignored in the boom and <b>titles</b> included <b>Lock's</b> Quest and Ninjatown released in September and October respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Steiner {{finally reached}} his {{breaking}} point {{near the end}} of 1988, when he attacked Rotunda, turning face as a sympathetic underdog. At Starrcade 1988 he received a match with Rotunda for the TV <b>title.</b> Despite being <b>locked</b> in a cage at ringside, Sullivan had an ace up his sleeve. The ace was former opponent Steve Williams, a University of Oklahoma alumnus who had just joined the Varsity Club. Though Williams was unable to prevent Steiner from winning the TV title, his arrival signified a major recruiting coup for Sullivan. Earlier in the night, Sullivan and Williams brought gold back to the stable when they defeated the Fantastics for the United States Tag-Team titles. Steiner’s run with the TV title ended a few months later as Rotundo regained the belt at the Chi-Town Rumble on February 20, 1989. He did get impressive backup from his brother Scott, a recent arrival who was eager to help. Though Scott's role was initially limited to moral support, he and Rick would later go on {{to become one of the}} most accomplished tag team in the promotion's history. The Steiners celebrated when Rick and [...] "Hot Stuff" [...] Eddie Gilbert won the US Tag-Team titles from Williams and Sullivan on February 28.|$|R
5000|$|Reader Rabbit was {{originally}} conceived by the Grimm sisters and titled Reader Rabbit and the Fabulous Word Factory. It {{was released in}} late 1983 or early 1984 (and featured in the 1983 holiday special for The Computer Chronicles''''), with later versions released in 1984. In 1986, both Reader Rabbit 2.0 and Math Rabbit were released, while 1987 saw the release of Writer Rabbit, {{with the intention of}} having a Rabbit series that featured different academic subjects; however, the <b>title</b> soon became <b>locked</b> in as Reader Rabbit, and under that name, the developers explored subjects beyond reading. (Math Rabbit would later be renamed to Reader Rabbit Math). Many critics and gaming historians erroneously assert that the Reader Rabbit series officially began in 1986. The 1990s saw an audio cassette release of some of the game's most popular music, entitled Reader Rabbit's Sing Along Favorites In 1995, The Learning Company was bought by Softkey after it made a hostile takeover bid, with the latter company adopting the former company's name. This saw the series go into a new direction, which involved cutting R&D costs, downsizing staff, re-releasing older software with a minimal redesign, and selling cheaper software. The Platinum line of budget titles pushed the retail price for edutainment down to $12.99 and swapped the fancy packaging for a simple jewel case. At this time, SoftKey founder Kevin O'Leary recalled [...] "I’d get a $US12 million order for [...] "Reader Rabbit," [...] it would blow up behind me, the logistics. I couldn’t deliver", noting that he gave Mike Perik half his equity to solve the problem.|$|R
