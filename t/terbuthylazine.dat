50|$|<b>Terbuthylazine</b> is a {{selective}} herbicide. Chemically, it is a chlorotriazine; compared with atrazine and simazine, {{it has a}} tert-butyl group {{in place of the}} isopropyl and ethyl groups, respectively.|$|E
30|$|Because {{there is}} a greater risk of damage to radiata pine from hexazinone than <b>terbuthylazine,</b> label {{recommendations}} warn not to use a surfactant with hexazinone, whereas it can be used with <b>terbuthylazine</b> (Young 2015). Thus, a surfactant was used with <b>terbuthylazine</b> in the current trial but not with hexazinone. This may explain why <b>terbuthylazine</b> gave better control of broom in this trial than that reported by Rolando et al. (2011 b). In that trial, no surfactant was used in their treatment when <b>terbuthylazine</b> was used in combination with hexazinone. The improved control of broom by <b>terbuthylazine</b> in the current trial suggests that, where broom is the main weed targeted during release spraying, adding a surfactant to <b>terbuthylazine</b> may be better than adding hexazinone.|$|E
40|$|<b>Terbuthylazine</b> {{was used}} for weed control in German maize {{cropping}} in 2011 on nearly 86 % of total maize acreage. The ongoing success of this 45 year old herbicide {{can be explained by}} the various features for its use in maize as well as by responsible handling and care. Characteristic features of <b>terbuthylazine</b> are a broad controlled weed spectrum, superior residual activity, application timing flexibility from pre- to late postemergence, excellent crop tolerance, low soil mobility, perceivable speed of efficacy and suitability as partner for other active ingredients. Thanks to its combinability, <b>terbuthylazine</b> has maintained its importance in maize cropping, although the ubiquitous occurrence of triazine-resistant biotypes always has to be expected. In a weed monitoring in Germany and Austria in the 2008 and 2009 field season, the broad controlled weed spectrum and the efficacy of <b>terbuthylazine</b> in mixture with the 4 -HPPD-inhibitor mesotrione on triazineresistant weed biotypes have been proven comparatively. 4 -HPPD-inhibitors are preferred mixture partners due to their physiological synergism in combination with <b>terbuthylazine.</b> This feature enables a reduction of use rate of both <b>terbuthylazine</b> and mixture partner. Targeted post-emergence application of optimized pre-mixture herbicides achieves enhanced reliability and a noticeable increase of speed of efficacy. Combinations of <b>terbuthylazine</b> and residual graminicides offer the advantage of an all-embracing control of grass and broad leaved weed flora in maize by one pass only. <b>Terbuthylazine</b> is also effective against weeds not controlled adequately by other maize-selective herbicides. For reasons of preventative ground water protection, since 1991 a targeted management of the active ingredient <b>terbuthylazine</b> is carried out by manufacturers and registration holders. It envisages a limitation of <b>terbuthylazine</b> usage in maize only, one use per season in mixture with other active ingredients in spring only, and a maximum use rate of 750 g/ha. For treatments in areas with vulnerable groundwater situations (e. g. in open exposed Jurassic Karst formations) other herbicides than <b>terbuthylazine</b> containing products are strongly recommended. These measures have been demonstrated to be successful; in case of consequent compliance with these stewardship measures <b>terbuthylazine</b> can be continuously used as basic active ingredient in chemical weed control in maize for the future, maintaining all the advantages of this active substances for agriculture in Europe...|$|E
40|$|Interactions with {{dissolved}} {{organic matter}} or suspended clay minerals can both affect the transport of organic xenobiotics in soil. Therefore, dialysis experiments were carried out to investigate such binding interactions of two triazine herbicide metabolites (desethyl <b>terbuthylazine,</b> hydroxydesethyl <b>terbuthylazine)</b> with dissolved humic acids and montmorillonite. Using 14 C-labeled compounds in a small-scale dialysis device allowed sensitive determination of both free and bound analytes. Adsorption of desethyl <b>terbuthylazine</b> to montmorillonite steadily increased with falling pH from 10 to 2, whereas adsorption of hydroxydesethyl <b>terbuthylazine</b> showed a maximum at pH 4 - 4. 5. This was ascribed to different protonation of the compounds, owing to pKA values of approximately 2 and 5 for desethyl <b>terbuthylazine</b> and hydroxydesethyl <b>terbuthylazine,</b> respectively. Addition of dissolved humic acids to the montmorillonite suspension did not change the pH-dependency of binding for both compounds.

A monitoring study of two herbicides (<b>terbuthylazine</b> and oxyfluorfen) in the first 2 cm of soil, runoff water and sediment yield, was carried out after several rainfall events. <b>Terbuthylazine</b> was monitored in spring and winter seasons, whereas oxyfluorfen was monitored only in winter season. At the end of the experiment, no <b>terbuthylazine</b> soil residues were recovered from the winter application (107 days after application) whereas 15 % of <b>terbuthylazine</b> applied in spring still remained (85 days after application) in the soil. Oxyfluorfen was more persistent than <b>terbuthylazine</b> and 48 % of this applied herbicide remaining in the soil {{at the end of the}} winter (107 days after application). Very low percentage of the applied <b>terbuthylazine</b> was recovered in runoff water, although it was slightly higher in winter (0. 53 %) than in spring (0. 16 %). No differences in <b>terbuthylazine</b> sediment yields between both seasons were observed. Due to the low water solubility of oxyfluorfen, very low amounts of this herbicide was recovered in runoff waters, whereas in sediment yields 39. 5 % of the total applied herbicide was recovered. These data show that the dissipation of <b>terbuthylazine</b> due to runoff is low and it could be related to other soil processes like leaching and degradation, whereas oxyfluorfen dissipation is more affected by runoff processes, being mainly either co-transported in sediment yields or tagged to soil aggregates.

40|$|Trabajo presentado en la EGU General Assembly 2016 (European Geosciences Union), celebrada en Viena del 12 al 17 de abril de 2015. Several {{pollution}} {{episodes in}} surface and groundwaters with pesticides {{have occurred in}} areas where olive crops are established. For that reason, {{it is necessary to}} know the evolution of some pesticides in olive trees plantation depending on their seasonal application. This is especially important when conventional tillage is used. A monitoring of two herbicides (<b>terbuthylazine</b> and oxyfluorfen) in the first cm of soil and, in runoff and sediment yield was carried out after several rainfall events. The rainfall occurred during the study was higher in winter than in spring giving rise more runoff in winter. However, no differences in sediment yields were observed between spring and winter. <b>Terbuthylazine</b> depletion from soil is associated to the first important rainfall events in both seasons (41 mm in spring and 30 mm in winter). At the end of the experiment, no <b>terbuthylazine</b> soil residues were recovered in winter whereas 15 % of <b>terbuthylazine</b> applied remained in spring. Oxyfluorfen showed a character more persistent than <b>terbuthylazine</b> remaining 48 % of the applied {{at the end of the}} experiment due to its low water solubility. Higher percentage from the applied of <b>terbuthylazine</b> was recovered in runoff in winter (0. 55 %) than in spring (0. 17 %). Nevertheless, no differences in <b>terbuthylazine</b> sediments yields between both seasons were observed. That is in agreement with the values of runoff and sediment yields accumulated in tanks in both seasons. Due to the low water solubility of oxyfluorfen very low amount of this herbicide was recovered in runoff. Whereas, in sediment yields the 39. 5 % of the total applied was recovered. These data show that the dissipation of <b>terbuthylazine</b> from soil is closely related with leaching processes and in less extent with runoff. However, oxyfluorfen dissipation is more affected by runoff processes since this herbicide is co-transported in sediment yields.

30|$|The highest {{concentrations}} in stream water were recorded {{on the day}} of herbicide application at W 1 (<b>terbuthylazine,</b> 9.6  μg L− 1; hexazinone, 5.3  μg L− 1). <b>Terbuthylazine</b> concentrations were above drinking water standards for several hours, well below the decadal time frame required to exceed these standards. Thereafter, concentrations rapidly declined, with the highest concentrations recorded 1  month after herbicide application, 2  days after a 50 -mm (24  h) rainfall event. Concentrations declined downstream and were < 5  μg L− 1 where the stream exited the forested catchment. <b>Terbuthylazine</b> only was detected in sediment for up to 60  days after herbicide application. Concentrations and persistence of both herbicides in stream water were well below toxic levels for aquatic organisms.|$|E
30|$|In {{contrast}} to hexazinone, there is relatively little {{information on the}} dissipation of and ecotoxicity of <b>terbuthylazine</b> when used in a forest environment and limited data on its potential to bioaccumulate, the reason it was prohibited. Ecotoxicology data on <b>terbuthylazine</b> indicate that it is considered moderately toxic to both cold and warm water fish, slightly toxic to aquatic invertebrates, and highly toxic to aquatic plants, algae, and estuarine and marine invertebrates (Table  7) (European Food Safety Authority 2011; Tomlin 2006). Bioaccumulation {{is defined as the}} process that causes increased chemical concentration in an aquatic organism compared to that in water and the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) is the ratio of the concentration of the chemical in the organism compared to that in water (Vallack et al. 1998; Mackay and Fraser 2000). From a scientific perspective there is no threshold defining problematic values of bioaccumulation. For rainbow trout exposed to <b>terbuthylazine</b> at 1 % of the 50 % lethal concentration (LC 50) value, Tarja et al. (2003) reported a BAF of between 6.2 and 8.1 for <b>terbuthylazine</b> at temperatures ranging between 4 °C and 17 °C, respectively. Beek et al. (1992) considered chemicals with a BCF of less than 30 to present no cause for concern. Mackay and Fraser (2000) suggest an octanol/water partition co-efficient (log PKow) of 5.0 or greater as a threshold for the onset of bioaccumulation and at 3.2 <b>terbuthylazine</b> sits well within this limit (Table  7). These studies question the rating assigned to <b>terbuthylazine</b> as likely to bioaccumulate and indicate an independent assessment is needed {{to determine whether or not}} the use of the chemical actually presents a threat to native New Zealand biota. <b>Terbuthylazine</b> is not considered a persistent chemical, DT 50 in soil ranges between 30  days to 60  days (Table  7) and aqueous hydrolysis occurs over a similar period (Tomlin 2006). For a chemical that is only applied once or twice every 28 to 30  years, the potential to bioaccumulate will be limited as the chemical will not be in the environment long enough for this to occur.|$|E

For the mixture exposures that fall into Group IIIA, the primary drivers were six substances: Diclofenac, Clarithromycin, Tramadol, <b>terbuthylazine</b> desethyl, <b>Terbuthylazine,</b> and PBDEs. This suggests that for these mixtures, risk assessors should focus on refining the exposure and toxicity estimates for these compounds.|$|E
40|$|Contamination of waters by {{xenobiotic}} compounds such as pesticides {{presents a}} serious environmental problem with substantial levels of pesticides now contaminating European water resources. The {{aim of this}} work was to evaluate {{the ability of the}} fungi Fusarium oxysporum, Aspergillus oryzae, Lentinula edodes, Penicillium brevicompactum and Lecanicillium saksenae, for the biodegradation of the pesticides <b>terbuthylazine,</b> difenoconazole and pendimethalin in batch liquid cultures. These pesticides are common soil and water contaminants and <b>terbuthylazine</b> is considered the most persistent triazine herbicide in surface environments. P. brevicompactum and L. saksenae were achieved by enrichment, isolation and screening of fungi capable to metabolize the pesticides studied. The isolates were obtained from two pesticide-primed materials (soil and biomixture). Despite the relatively high persistence of <b>terbuthylazine,</b> the results obtained in this work showed that the fungi species studied have a high capability of biotransformation of this xenobiotic, comparatively the results obtained in other similar studies. The highest removal percentage of <b>terbuthylazine</b> from liquid medium was achieved with A. oryzae (~ 80 %), although the major biodegradation has been reached with P. brevicompactum. The higher ability of P. brevicompactum to metabolize <b>terbuthylazine</b> was presumably acquired through chronic exposure to contamination with the herbicide. L. saksenae could remove 99. 5 % of the available pendimethalin in batch liquid cultures. L. edodes proved to be a fungus with a high potential for biodegradation of pesticides, especially difenoconazole and pendimethalin. Furthermore, the metabolite desethyl-terbuthylazine was detected in L. edodes liquid culture medium, indicating <b>terbuthylazine</b> biodegradation by this fungus. The fungi strains investigated could prove to be valuable as active pesticide-degrading microorganisms, increasing the efficiency of biopurification systems containing wastewaters contaminated with the xenobiotics studied or compounds with similar intrinsic characteristics...|$|E
30|$|Use of <b>terbuthylazine</b> and hexazinone is {{restricted}} on FSC-certified forests subject to derogation. Environmental certification {{has resulted in}} a shift from broadcast application of <b>terbuthylazine</b> and hexazinone to greater use of spot weed control in the first year after tree planting. Spot weed control can reduce the amount of active ingredient used by up to 89 %. Non-chemical weed control is not widely used by the forest industry as it is not as cost-effective as current herbicide regimes.|$|E
30|$|If the {{indicators}} for identifying highly hazardous pesticides for FSC certified land and thresholds for concern are modified, and <b>terbuthylazine</b> {{is removed from}} the list of prohibited pesticides, the data presented and collated here support a low-risk profile of this herbicide in the context of current forestry practice. Assuming that the prohibition of <b>terbuthylazine</b> and/or hexazinone continues to be pursued, however, studies need to be conducted to determine if these herbicides can be gradually phased out and replaced with herbicides that meet certification requirements. Over the medium term, it may be sufficient to retain spot treatments of <b>terbuthylazine</b> and hexazinone as this markedly reduces use of these herbicides. As <b>terbuthylazine</b> and hexazinone are very effective herbicides that provide broad spectrum long-term weed control, with little phyto-toxicity to crop trees, their replacement is likely to have economic implications. Development of a national monitoring system for reporting of pesticide use in New Zealand planted forests may be one possible course of action that enables the forest industry to more clearly demonstrate its existing commitment to protecting the planted forest environment and to facilitate better documentation of annual herbicide inputs.|$|E

Control in the second year consisted of an aerial application of a clopyralid and triclopyr mix to both trials.|$|E
30|$|Inherent in the {{hypothesis}} of {{a higher risk of}} herbicide contamination in steepland forest waterways was the potential for steep highly erodible sites such as the catchment in this study to convey herbicides to the stream via sediment transport off the hillsides, particularly <b>terbuthylazine.</b> Although <b>terbuthylazine</b> was detected in stream sediment at W 1 for 2  months after herbicide application in this study, it persisted at higher concentrations and for a longer period in stream sediment in both year 1 and year 2 in a similar study conducted in the Bay of Plenty (Baillie et al., 2015). The lower initial concentrations of <b>terbuthylazine</b> reaching the stream water on the day of herbicide application at this site and the high herbicide terrestrial decay rates (a half-life of < 1  day) (Garrett et al., 2016) are two potential contributing factors influencing these results.|$|E

Clopyralid, fluazifop and haloxyfop could probably control weeds selectively around Coprosma robusta, Hebe stricta, Pittosporum tenuiflorum, Carex flagellifera, Phormium cookianum and Leptospermum scoparium. Clopyralid was not tolerated by Fuchsia excortica, which was the most sensitive species to many of the herbicides evaluated. However, this species showed good tolerance to haloxyfop, fluazifop and <b>terbuthylazine.</b> Although Plagianthus regius was also damaged by clopyralid, it tolerated metsulfuron and <b>terbuthylazine.</b> The two grasses evaluated, Poa cita and Chionochloa flavicans, tolerated clopyralid and aminopyralid well, but were severely damaged by haloxyfop, fluazifop and <b>terbuthylazine...</b>|$|E

The prohibition of two active ingredients that constitute 50 % of the total amount of herbicide used on planted forest land certified by the FSC would severely impact current forest weed control operations, unless viable, cost effective, alternative weed management options were found. The infrequent use of <b>terbuthylazine</b> and hexazinone within one rotation of approximately 30  years in New Zealand’s planted forests considerably reduces the environmental risk of polluting ground and surface waters. In addition, wide use of spot weed control means the risk of off-site movement of these herbicides is reduced. Data from a recent national survey of pesticides in groundwater in New Zealand indicate levels of these pesticides are below that likely to be toxic to humans and the environment.|$|E

The effect of soil amendment with an organic residue from olive oil production was also assessed. <b>Terbuthylazine</b> reduced the efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry of plants due to chronic photoinhibition, and this effect was counterbalanced by soil amendment with the organic waste, whereas the photosystem II photochemistry of olive plants was not affected by glyphosate or by glyphosate and organic waste addition. In this study, we have shown that the soil application of <b>terbuthylazine</b> is a source of indirect phytotoxicity for olive plants. We have also observed that the olive plants were not affected by higher amounts of glyphosate in the soil. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} slow release {{formulations}} of pesticides {{is the subject}} of increasing attention with the aim of prolonging the biological efficacy of pesticides and attenuating their adverse environmental effects. In this work, organohydrotalcites (OHTs) are proposed as novel supports for the slow release of <b>terbuthylazine,</b> a herbicide widely applied to agricultural land. Two different OHTs were prepared by intercalating dodecylsulfate (DDS) and sebacate (SEB) anions into Mg-Al hydrotalcite (HT). Adsorption experiments revealed that <b>terbuthylazine</b> was well adsorbed by both HT-DDS and HT-SEB, whereas <b>terbuthylazine</b> adsorption by unmodified (inorganic) Mg-Al HT was negligible. Different terbuthylazine-OHT complexes were prepared by mixing the herbicide with the OHTs, using different solvents to favor the adsorbent-herbicide interaction. The ability of the herbicide-OHT complexes to slow the release of the herbicide into water and to reduce the herbicide leaching losses in soil was evaluated through batch release and column leaching tests. Compared to a standard commercial formulation of the herbicide, the complexes prepared from both HT-DDS and HT-SEB retarded the release of <b>terbuthylazine</b> into aqueous solution and reduced the herbicide leaching through soil columns. These results indicated promising usefulness of OHTs as suitable supports for the design of pesticide slow release formulations with the aim of reducing the adverse effects derived from rapid transport losses of the chemical once applied to soils.

40|$|The {{herbicide}} <b>terbuthylazine</b> (TBA) {{is widely}} used for preemergence or postemergence control of many grass and broadleaf weeds and has, besides other issues, a poor aqueous solubility profile that results in reduced bioavailability. Cyclodextrins and modified cyclodextrins were considered, among other substances, appropriate agents for improving pesticide water solubility. Therefore, the inclusion complex formation of <b>terbuthylazine</b> with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) was studied to attain its aqueous solubility enhancement. Their characterization was accomplished with different analytical techniques, namely, by UV-Vis, DSC, FTIR, and 1 H NMR. From {{the analysis of the}} complexation performance of the herbicide it was concluded that the interaction of <b>terbuthylazine</b> with CDs leads to the formation of inclusion complexes with a stoichiometry of 1 [*]:[*] 1. The association constants of the TBA/β-CD and TBA/HP-β-CD complexes were determined by UV. The mean values obtained for the stability constants are 460. 4 ± 26. 5 and 532. 1 ± 27. 6 to TBA/β-CD and TBA/HP-β-CD, respectively. 1 H NMR data corroborate the formation of the TBA/β-CD and TBA/HP-β-CD complexes synthesized by the kneading method. A formulation incorporating TBA cyclodextrin complexes might lead to an improvement in <b>terbuthylazine</b> bioavailability. The development of TBA-CD formulations may be interesting since it would enable, through their inclusion into the hydrophobic cavity of CDs, enhancement of solubility, bioavailability, and stability of the herbicide...|$|E
30|$|In New Zealand, {{the maximum}} {{acceptable}} value (MAV) for drinking water for hexazinone is 0.4  mg L- 1 (0.4  ppm) and for <b>terbuthylazine</b> is 0.008  mg L- 1 (0.008  ppm) (Ministry of Health 2008), {{values that are}} consistent with that used by WHO (World Health Organisation 2010). In a national survey of pesticides in New Zealand’s groundwater in 2010, <b>terbuthylazine</b> was the most frequently detected pesticide, found in 10 % of the wells sampled (Close and Skinner 2012). The highest level of <b>terbuthylazine</b> detected was 0.0058  mg L- 1 (0.0058  ppm) which is 73 % of the MAV. In all other wells where it was detected, however, it was below 10 % of the MAV (Close and Skinner 2012). Hexazinone was found in only 1.9 % of the wells sampled, with the highest concentration detected of 0.0007  mg L- 1 (0.0007  ppm) which is below 0.2 % of the MAV. These values are below the LC 50 values quoted for rainbow trout and Daphnia spp., both aquatic organisms used in standard ecotoxicity tests (Table  7). The wells included in the 2010 national survey of pesticides in groundwater represented a mix of land uses, mainly agriculture and horticulture, with no wells sampled with an associated forestry land use (Close and Skinner 2012). <b>Terbuthylazine</b> is used in both the agricultural and horticultural industries in New Zealand, as well as forestry (Manktelow et al. 2005). The wells sampled in the 2010 national survey of pesticides in groundwater represent deep groundwater and it is, therefore, not possible to draw conclusions regarding pesticide detection and associated land use. What these results do indicate is that levels of <b>terbuthylazine</b> and hexazinone in New Zealand groundwater do not exceed toxicity thresholds.|$|E
30|$|There was no {{drainage}} below 1 -m {{depth in}} the first month after spray application. On the following month, there were six drainage events ranging from 12 to 36  mm. Both <b>terbuthylazine</b> and hexazinone were located predominantly in the 0 – 10 cm soil depth, followed by the litter layer with only small amounts detected below 10 cm soil depth. Following a month of drainage events, hexazinone showed an increase at a soil depth of 10 – 50  cm. Both <b>terbuthylazine</b> and hexazinone rapidly dissipated with time after spray application, and predicted half-lives for both active ingredients were less than 1  day.|$|E
30|$|When {{compared}} with toxicology data (Table  1), {{the duration of}} detectable concentrations of both <b>terbuthylazine</b> and hexazinone recorded in this study (Fig.  4 a, b) were below the levels required to pose a risk to algae and were several orders of magnitude lower than the toxicity (LC 50) levels for Daphnia spp. and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). These results indicate that <b>terbuthylazine</b> and hexazinone concentrations in {{this study did not}} exceed the regional rule requirement that ‘discharge of agrichemical chemicals from aircraft must not result in any harmful concentration of agrichemical into water’ (Bay of Plenty Regional Council, 2003).|$|E
30|$|Aerially applied <b>terbuthylazine</b> and hexazinone {{was found}} to have the {{greatest}} potential to move off a steep Recent Soil site during the first 2  weeks following application. After this time, the likelihood of further movement will be low due to the very rapid dissipation of both active ingredients, plus their retention in the litter layer and 0 – 10 cm soil depth. The management of organic matter, including litter (LFH) and harvest residues, clearly {{plays an important role in}} determining the environmental fate of both <b>terbuthylazine</b> and hexazinone. Further research should be undertaken to confirm these findings.|$|E
30|$|These results {{highlight}} potential {{treatments to}} either replace <b>terbuthylazine</b> and hexazinone, or reduce their use during establishment weed control for Pinus radiata and Pseudotsuga menziesii, notably for sites dominated by Cytisus scoparius L. (Scotch broom).|$|E
