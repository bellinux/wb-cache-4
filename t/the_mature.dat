5|$|This protein {{belongs to}} the apolipoprotein A1/A4/E family and {{contains}} 2 coiled coil domains. Overall, APOA5 is predicted to have approximately 60% a-helical content. <b>The</b> <b>mature</b> APOA5 protein spans a length of 366 amino acid residues, of which 23 amino acids code for the signal peptide. The molecular mass of the precursor was calculated to be 41 kDa, while <b>the</b> <b>mature</b> APOA5 protein was calculated to be 39 kDa.|$|E

5|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} non-coding RNAs {{are always}} polyadenylated {{at the end}} of transcription.

But, for many long noncoding RNAs– a seemingly large group of regulatory RNAs that, for example, includes the RNA Xist, which mediates X chromosome inactivation– a poly(A) tail is part of <b>the</b> <b>mature</b> RNA.|$|E

5|$|Narcissus {{plants have}} one to several basal leaves which are linear, ligulate or strap shaped (long and narrow), {{sometimes}} channelled adaxially to semiterete, and may (pedicellate) {{or may not}} (sessile) have a petiole stalk. The leaves are flat and broad to cylindrical at the base and arise from the bulb. The emerging plant generally has two leaves, but <b>the</b> <b>mature</b> plant usually three, rarely four, and they are covered with a cutin containing cuticle, giving them a waxy appearance. Leaf colour is light green to blue-green. In <b>the</b> <b>mature</b> plant the leaves extend higher than the flower stem, but in some species the leaves are low hanging. The leaf base is encased in a colourless sheath. After flowering the leaves turn yellow and die back once the seed pod (fruit) is ripe.|$|E

5|$|A warm {{seclusion}} is <b>the</b> <b>mature</b> {{phase of}} the extratropical cyclone lifecycle. This was conceptualized after the ERICA field experiment of the late 1980s, which produced observations of intense marine cyclones that indicated an anomalously warm low-level thermal structure, secluded (or surrounded) by a bent-back warm front and a coincident chevron-shaped band of intense surface winds. The Norwegian Cyclone Model, as developed by the Bergen School of Meteorology, largely observed cyclones {{at the tail end}} of their lifecycle and used the term occlusion to identify the decaying stages.|$|E
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of having an {{efficient}} index which will predict future gain in growing-fattening meat animals, {{the present study was}} quantatively undertaken to compare serum total fat, total cholesterol, lecithin and alkaline phosphatase concentration between the early and <b>the</b> late <b>maturing</b> groups in cockerels as the fundamental experiment. Results were as follows: 1) Serum total fat and total cholesterol concentration were lower in <b>the</b> late <b>maturing</b> group than in the early at 12 weeks of age, but there has not been seen any difference of their constituents between <b>the</b> late <b>maturing</b> group at 15 weeks of age and <b>the</b> early <b>maturing</b> at 12 weeks of age. 2) Serum lecithin concentration was markedly higher in <b>the</b> late <b>maturing</b> group than in <b>the</b> early <b>maturing</b> at 12 weeks of age and thereafter <b>the</b> late <b>maturing</b> group remained fairy constant level during growth. 3) Serum alkaline phosphatase concentration was markedly lower in <b>the</b> late <b>maturing</b> group than in <b>the</b> early <b>maturing</b> at 12 weeks of age and thereafter <b>the</b> late <b>maturing</b> group remained fairy constant level during growth. From these results, it seemed that there were highly significant differences between serum lecithin and alkaline phosphatase concentration of the early and <b>the</b> late <b>maturing</b> groups, and that their constituents might be used as an efficient index to predict gaining ability in immature animals...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{differences}} in the relative lengths of the DNA telomere between <b>the</b> <b>matured</b> and <b>the</b> adolescent Chinese alligators（Alligator sinensis）and to offer the possible molecular evidence for judging the age of the Chinese alligators，we applied the PCR method to amplify the telomere DNA of both <b>the</b> <b>matured</b> and <b>the</b> juvenile Chinese alligators In our research. Subsequently, we analyzed and compared the outcomes of the two groups by using a Semi-quantitative technique. The results of our analyses show that the relative average gray value of the blood cells' telomere PCR products of the adolescent group is higher than that of <b>the</b> <b>matured</b> group. These analytical results are indications that the blood cells' telomere DNA sequence of the adolescent Chinese alligators is longer than that of <b>the</b> <b>matured</b> Chinese alligators.

Fruit body luminescence is highly variable between fruit bodies found on different logs in different environments.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>mature</b> {{stage of}} a thunderstorm, the warmed air {{continues}} to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther. Often this 'cap' is the tropopause. The air is instead forced to spread out, giving the storm a characteristic anvil shape. The resulting cloud is called cumulonimbus incus. The water droplets coalesce into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles. As these fall, they melt to become rain. If the updraft is strong enough, the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large {{that they do not}} melt completely but fall as hail. While updrafts are still present, the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it, creating downdrafts as well. The simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks <b>the</b> <b>mature</b> stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds. During this stage, considerable internal turbulence can occur within, which manifests as strong winds, severe lightning, and even tornadoes.|$|E
