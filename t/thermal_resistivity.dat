50|$|At low {{temperatures}} (<10 K) the anharmonic interaction does not influence the {{mean free path}} and therefore, the <b>thermal</b> <b>resistivity</b> is determined only from processes for which q-conservation does not hold. These processes include the scattering of phonons by crystal defects, or the scattering {{from the surface of}} the crystal in case of high quality single crystal. Therefore, thermal conductance depends on the external dimensions of the crystal and the quality of the surface.

40|$|An {{appropriate}} {{heat conduction}} model is indispensable for experimental data analysis in nanothermometry {{in order to}} extract parameters of interests and to achieve a fundamental understanding of phonon-mediated heat transfer in nanostructures and across interfaces. Recently, nanoscale periodic metallic gratings are used {{as a group of}} distributed heaters as well as transducers in nanothermometry. However, in this technique, there are coupled hotspot-size-dependent effective thermal conductivity (ETC) and hotspot-size-dependent <b>thermal</b> interface <b>resistivity,</b> which posts a challenge for experimental data analysis using Fourier’s law that fails to extract both ETC and <b>thermal</b> interface <b>resistivity</b> simultaneously. To overcome this challenge, a novel two-parameter nondiffusive heat conduction (TPHC) model, which has been successfully applied to data analysis in different types of pump-probe experiments, is applied to analyze laser-induced nondiffusive heat transfer in nanoscale metallic grating experiments. Since the hotspot-size-dependent ETC is automatically captured by the TPHC model, the hotspot-size-dependent interface resistivity becomes the only parameter to be determined from experiments through data fitting. Thus, the hotspot-size-dependent <b>thermal</b> interface <b>resistivity</b> can be determined from experiments without the impact from the hotspot-size-dependent ETC. Currently, {{there is a lack of}} a criterion to predict when Fourier’s law breaks down in nanoscale heat transfer. To fill this gap, a criterion based the TPHC model is identified to predict the valid range of Fourier’s law, which is validated in both theoretical analyses and nanoscale metallic grating experiments...|$|R

We analyze the <b>thermal</b> <b>resistivity's</b> variation with temperature and clarify misconceptions about existing experimental literature. The resistivity initially increases sublinearly because of phase space effects and ultra strong anharmonic renormalizations of specific bands. This effect is the strongest factor in the favorable thermoelectric properties of PbTe, and it explains its limitations at higher T. This quantitative prediction opens the prospect of phonon phase space engineering to tailor the lifetimes of crucial heat carrying phonons by considering different structure or nanostructure geometries.

The characteristic temperature of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, T_SF, is tuned to a minimum but finite value at H_c, which coincides {{with the end of}} the T-linear regime in the electrical resistivity. A third temperature scale, T_QP, signals the formation of quasiparticles, as fermions of charge e obeying the Wiedemann-Franz law.

5000|$|A Vapor Trap Diode is {{fabricated}} in {{a similar}} fashion to a Variable Conductance Heat Pipe (VCHP), with a gas reservoir {{at the end of the}} condenser. During fabrication, the heat pipe is charged with the working fluid and a controlled amount of a Non-Condensable Gas (NCG). During normal operation, the flow of the working fluid vapor from the evaporator to the condenser sweeps the NCG into the reservoir, where it doesn’t interfere with the normal heat pipe operation. When the nominal condenser is heated, the vapor flow is from the nominal condenser to the nominal evaporator. The NCG is dragged along with the flowing vapor, completely blocking the nominal evaporator, and greatly increasing the <b>thermal</b> <b>resistivity</b> of the heat pipe. In general, there is some heat transfer to the nominal adiabatic section. Heat is then conducted through the heat pipe walls to the evaporator.

50|$|The {{leakage current}} of logic {{switching}} transistors increases with temperature. In rare instances, this {{may lead to}} thermal runaway in digital circuits. This is not a common problem, since leakage currents usually make up {{a small portion of}} overall power consumption, so the increase in power is fairly modest — for an Athlon 64, the power dissipation increases by about 10% for every 30 degrees Celsius. For a device with a TDP of 100 W, for thermal runaway to occur, the heat sink would have to have a <b>thermal</b> <b>resistivity</b> of over 3 K/W (kelvins per watt), which is about 6 times worse than a stock Athlon 64 heat sink. (A stock Athlon 64 heat sink is rated at 0.34 K/W, although the actual thermal resistance to the environment is somewhat higher, due to the thermal boundary between processor and heatsink, rising temperatures in the case, and other thermal resistances..) Regardless, an inadequate heat sink with a thermal resistance of over 0.5 to 1 K/W would result in the destruction of a 100 W device even without thermal runaway effects.|$|E
