The elite {{had a number of}} grievances against Estimé. Not only had he largely excluded them from the often lucrative levers of government, but he also enacted the country's first income tax, fostered the growth of labor unions, and suggested that vodou be considered as a religion equivalent to Roman Catholicism—a notion that the Europeanized elite abhorred. Lacking direct influence in Haitian affairs, the elite resorted to clandestine lobbying among the officer corps. Their efforts, in combination with deteriorating domestic conditions, led to a coup in May 1950.|$|E

40|$|Many {{systems in}} science and {{engineering}} are governed by nonlinear evolution equations. Starting with the familiar case of the simple pendulum, Daniel Borrero discusses some of the ways that nonlinear systems differ from linear ones and how nonlinearity can lead to unexpected behavior. One famous example is the so-called 2 ̆ 2 butterfly effect, 2 ̆ 2 where small differences in initial conditions can lead to drastically different long-term behavior. Another consequence of nonlinearity is that systems can have multiple solutions for a given set of parameters. The competition between solutions often leads to very complicated spatial and temporal dynamics. As it turns out, many of <b>the</b> most <b>time-honored</b> mathematical techniques used in the analysis of linear systems fail miserably in the analysis of the complex systems, forcing humans to resort to more qualitative and graphical approaches.
