5|$|Darwin <b>theorized</b> <b>that</b> species {{flourish}} or die when {{subjected to}} the processes of natural selection or selective breeding. Genetic drift was embraced as an additional mechanism of evolutionary development in the modern synthesis of the theory.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} <b>theorized</b> <b>that</b> light {{reflections}} and infrared emissions from 47 UMa b, along with tidal influence, could warm any moons {{in orbit around}} it to be habitable, despite the planet being outside the normally accepted habitable zone.|$|E
5|$|On the {{conservative}} side, foreign policy {{used to be}} anti-communist, but not very pro-democracy. And foreign policy liberal-style might be piously pro-democracy, but nervous about being anti-communist. Tom <b>theorized</b> <b>that</b> to be either, {{you had to be}} both.|$|E
5000|$|To <b>theorize</b> <b>that</b> non-dualism is {{qualified}} by difference. This is Ramanuja's approach.|$|R
50|$|The {{exact age}} of the site is undetermined. They <b>theorize</b> <b>that</b> the site may {{represent}} the sun, as crosses were utilized by the Mississippian culture frequently as a sun symbol. They also <b>theorize</b> <b>that</b> it was built by the Fort Ancient peoples, but the National Park Service and others suggest that it was built by the Hopewell culture.|$|R
50|$|Some {{linguists}} <b>theorize</b> <b>that</b> the North American usage {{derives from}} Irish or Scots-Irish sources.|$|R
5|$|Police, rejecting Kinne's story, <b>theorized</b> <b>that</b> she {{had gone}} out that evening {{intending}} robbery, and had chosen Ordoñez as her victim. When he resisted her orders to give her his money, police believed, Kinne had shot him.|$|E
5|$|After Kamo's {{release from}} prison, {{he worked in}} the Soviet customs office, by some {{accounts}} because he was too unstable to work for the secret police. He died in 1922 when a truck hit him while he was cycling. Although there is no proof of foul play, some have <b>theorized</b> <b>that</b> Stalin ordered his death to keep him quiet.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} shared {{association}} with skiing {{and the fact}} that both place names referring to Ullr and Skaði appear most frequently in Sweden, some scholars have proposed a particular connection between the two gods. On the other hand, Skaði may potentially be a masculine form and, as a result, some scholars have <b>theorized</b> <b>that</b> Skaði may have originally been a male deity.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{scholarship}} can {{be roughly}} {{divided into two}} camps. Some, such as Jacob N. Epstein <b>theorize</b> <b>that</b> the Tosefta as we have it developed from a proto-Tosefta recension which formed much of the basis for later Amoraic debate. Others, such as Hanokh Albeck, <b>theorize</b> <b>that</b> the Tosefta is a later compendium of several baraitot collections which were in use during the Amoraic period.|$|R
25|$|Since Amsvartnir is only {{mentioned}} in Gylfaginning, Rudolf Simek <b>theorizes</b> <b>that</b> Snorri invented the lake.|$|R
5000|$|Eliezer Yudkowsky <b>theorizes</b> <b>that</b> scope neglect {{plays a role}} {{in public}} {{perception}} of existential risks: ...|$|R
5|$|In 1827, the British {{botanist}} Robert Brown {{observed that}} dust particles inside pollen grains floating in water constantly jiggled about {{for no apparent}} reason. In 1905, Albert Einstein <b>theorized</b> <b>that</b> this Brownian motion {{was caused by the}} water molecules continuously knocking the grains about, and developed a hypothetical mathematical model to describe it. This model was validated experimentally in 1908 by French physicist Jean Perrin, thus providing additional validation for particle theory (and by extension atomic theory).|$|E
5|$|In 1881, Dr. Carlos Finlay, a Scottish {{physician}} practising in Havana, <b>theorized</b> <b>that</b> {{yellow fever}} was transmitted by a specific mosquito, later designated Aedes aegypti. The theory remained controversial {{for twenty years}} until confirmed in 1901 by Walter Reed. This was the first scientific proof of a disease being transmitted exclusively by an insect vector, and demonstrated that control of such diseases necessarily entailed control or eradication of its insect vector.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Lee, the police arrested {{a friend of}} Phagan's for the crime. Gradually, the police became convinced that these were not the culprits. By Monday, the police had <b>theorized</b> <b>that</b> the murder occurred {{on the second floor}} (the same as Frank's office) based on hair found on a lathe and what appeared to be blood on the ground of the second floor.|$|E
5000|$|Baudrillard <b>theorizes</b> <b>that</b> {{the lack}} of distinctions between reality and simulacra {{originates}} in several phenomena: ...|$|R
50|$|R. Pascal <b>theorizes</b> <b>that</b> The Three Marys may be Christianized {{versions}} of the Matres and Matronae.|$|R
2500|$|While wearing {{religious}} headdresses is {{not unusual}} in Egypt, {{the age at which}} it is appropriate for a girl to wear a hijab is a deeply debated issue among the literary scholars of Islam. [...] Some academics <b>theorize</b> <b>that</b> the laws of Islam make it obligatory at all ages, while others <b>theorize</b> <b>that</b> it is a cultural tradition and can be worn at her own accord.|$|R
5|$|It is <b>theorized</b> <b>that</b> the use {{of birth}} control pills should affect eating {{behaviour}} as they minimise or remove the fluctuations in hormone levels. The neurotransmitter serotonin is also thought {{to play a role}} in food intake. Serotonin is responsible for inhibiting eating and controlling meal size, among other things, and is modulated in part by ovarian hormones.|$|E
5|$|Sports journalism expert Kimberly Bissell {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} camera angles used during the 2004 Summer Olympic Games beach volleyball games. Bissell found that 20% of the camera angles were focused on the women's chests, and 17% on their buttocks. Bissell <b>theorized</b> <b>that</b> the appearance of the players draws fans attention more than their actual athleticism.|$|E
5|$|Surface level {{humidity}} is {{less than}} 0.1%. Venus's sulfuric acid rain never reaches the ground, but is evaporated by the heat before reaching the surface in a phenomenon known as virga. It is <b>theorized</b> <b>that</b> early volcanic activity released sulfur into the atmosphere and the high temperatures prevented it from being trapped into solid compounds on the surface as {{it was on the}} Earth.|$|E
50|$|Rudolf Simek <b>theorizes</b> <b>that</b> Snorri invented Naglfari but {{states that}} his reason {{for doing so}} is unknown.|$|R
2500|$|John Lindow {{says that}} {{scholars}} have generally followed Snorri's etymological {{connection with the}} root lof-, meaning [...] "praise." [...] Lindow says that, {{along with many other}} goddess, some scholars <b>theorize</b> <b>that</b> Lofn may simply be another name for the goddess Frigg. Rudolf Simek <b>theorizes</b> <b>that</b> Snorri used skaldic kennings to produce his Gylfaginning commentary about the goddess, while combining several etymologies with the Old Norse personal name Lofn.|$|R
5000|$|Culture writer Nathan Rabin <b>theorizes</b> <b>that</b> Marlon Brando's late {{career was}} heavily {{influenced}} by The Great Gazoo advising him.|$|R
5|$|The Arabs {{hoped that}} the disunity among the Byzantines would play to their advantage. Maslama had already {{established}} contact with Leo the Isaurian. French scholar Rodolphe Guilland <b>theorized</b> <b>that</b> Leo offered to become a vassal of the Caliphate, although the Byzantine general intended to use the Arabs for his own purposes. In turn, Maslama supported Leo hoping to maximize confusion and weaken the Empire, easing his own task of taking Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{pipeline}} {{was laid}} between Portland and a neighboring town during 1889. Haynes oversaw {{construction of the}} ten-mile (16km) long pipeline {{and the creation of}} the wells for pumping the gas. During his numerous buggy rides between the two towns, he first began to conceive of a novel form of motorized transportation. His thoughts on the topic were spurred by his need to regularly change horses because of their inability to endure the long distances and sandy roads he frequently traveled. He <b>theorized</b> <b>that</b> a motorized vehicle would be more economical than horse-and-buggy transportation, and could potentially move at a faster rate of speed.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} D. horneri skulls suggest that unlike many depictions of tyrannosaurids, this genus and likely other tyrannosaurids did not possess lips. Comparisons {{of the skull}} of this species with modern {{crocodiles}} show the same rugose bone structure that indicates the presence of large flat scales as opposed to lips. As the rough texture descends almost to the tooth line, it is <b>theorized</b> <b>that</b> Daspletosaurus teeth were not covered by lips, as {{there would have been}} no room for such soft tissue.|$|E
5000|$|According to Michael Oakeshott, pseudo-philosophy [...] "is <b>theorizing</b> <b>that</b> {{proceeds}} partly {{within and}} partly outside a given mode of inquiry." ...|$|R
25|$|Whitney also <b>theorizes</b> <b>that</b> the swirls {{in the sky}} could {{represent}} wind, evoking the mistral that had such {{a profound effect on}} Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence. (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, {{less than a month after}} painting The Starry Night.) Boime <b>theorizes</b> <b>that</b> the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Sundha Hill inscription, Shobhita [...] "took {{away the}} glory of" [...] {{the lord of}} Arbuda (Mount Abu). Historian R. B. Singh <b>theorizes</b> <b>that</b> this lord of Arbuda was {{probably}} Aranyaraja, a ruler of the Paramara branch of Abu. Dasharatha Sharma identifies him with another Paramara ruler named Dharanivaraha, who had been attacked and defeated by the Chaulukya king Mularaja. Sharma <b>theorizes</b> <b>that</b> Shobhita sided with Mularaja in this conflict.|$|R
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Cornell, O'Neill {{accepted}} {{a position as}} an instructor at Princeton University. There he started his research into high-energy particle physics. In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that <b>theorized</b> <b>that</b> the particles produced by a particle accelerator could be stored {{for a few seconds}} in a storage ring. The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{theories}} were advanced. Some {{surmised that}} the money had been found at a distant location by someone (or possibly even a wild animal), carried to the river bank, and reburied there. The sheriff of Cowlitz County proposed that Cooper accidentally dropped a few bundles on the airstair, which then blew off the aircraft and fell into the Columbia River. One local newspaper editor <b>theorized</b> <b>that</b> Cooper, knowing he could never spend the money, dumped it in the river, or buried portions of it at Tina Bar (and possibly elsewhere) himself. No hypothesis offered to date satisfactorily explains all of the existing evidence.|$|E
5|$|Georges Dumézil <b>theorized</b> <b>that</b> Víðarr {{represents}} a cosmic figure from an archetype {{derived from the}} Proto-Indo-Europeans. Dumézil stated that he was aligned with both vertical space, due to his placement of {{his foot on the}} wolf's lower jaw and his hand on the wolf's upper jaw, and horizontal space, due to his wide step and strong shoe, and that, by killing the wolf, Víðarr keeps the wolf from destroying the cosmos, and the cosmos can thereafter be restored after the destruction resulting from Ragnarök.|$|E

50|$|Gonzalez <b>theorizes</b> <b>that</b> Peñon {{woman is}} related to the {{historic}} Pericú people of Baja California, who also shared similar physical traits.|$|R
50|$|One can <b>theorize</b> <b>that</b> {{the worship}} of angels was {{occurring}} in Ancient Israel, hence a law was made to prohibit this activity.|$|R
