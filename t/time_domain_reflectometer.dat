Double peak, as a kind of Brillouin spectrum deformation, is important in the enhancement of spatial resolution, measurement accuracy, and crack detection. Due to the variances of the peak powers of the BSS along the fiber, the measured starting point of a step-shape frequency transition region is shifted and results in distance errors. Zero-padded short-time-Fourier-transform (STFT) can restore the transition-induced double peaks in the asymmetric and deformed BSS, thus offering more accurate and quicker measurements than the conventional Lorentz-fitting method. The recovering method based on the double-peak detection and corresponding BSS deformation can be applied to calculate the real starting point, which can improve the distance accuracy of the STFT-based BOTDR system...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{capillary}} barrier {{will form}} and restrict water flow when two porous materials with differing porous structures (e. g., a geotextile overlain by a fine-grained soil) are {{in contact with}} one another. This can be problematic as the capillary barrier may cause undesirable moisture build-up in the overlying soil. A new geotextile has been manufactured to help dissipate a barrier by “wicking ” or later-ally draining moisture away from the soil. Research at The University of Texas at Austin investigated the unsaturated properties of various versions of this wicking geotextile, under both woven and non-woven configurations. The testing program includes small soil column infiltration tests with moisture moni-tored by <b>time</b> <b>domain</b> <b>reflectometers.</b> Also, modified hanging column tests were conducted to define the hydraulic properties of the geotextile.

Water vapour adsorption by the soil was measured using weighing lysimeters. The obtained data indicated that nighttime water vapour adsorption {{is very important for}} areas characterised by high oscillation of air humidity. In a period of 8 months, viz. from February to August 1996, a total amount of 226 mm of water vapour was adsorbed by the soil, while the total rainfall was only 179 mm in the same period. Water vapour adsorption was found to be responsible for the diurnal fluctuations of the volumetric soil moisture content.

40|$|Water {{availability}} {{is predicted}} to be reduced and temperature to rise in the global climate change context. Future climate conditions may thus represent a serious risk for coffee cultivation especially in less favorable environment. Agroforestry has been postulated as a promising strategy to adapting to climate changes. Shade tree may minimize radiation and temperature near the soil surface and reduce soil evaporation. Shade tree may enhance infiltration, reduce runoff and increase rainfall water use efficiency by taking up water from deep soil layers. However, shade tree may reduce the water that reaches the soil by rainfall interception. Trees may consume additional water and can establish a competitive relationship depending on tree species characteristics, soil water availability, site conditions and management. In this experiment water dynamics and use was monitored in a mature agroforestry experiment where coffee shaded by a mixture of Tabebuia rosea and Simarouba glauca is compared to full sun coffee over 2012 and 2013. The water balance was obtained by two independent approaches: 1) measuring directly all components of water balance (trees and coffee transpiration; soil evaporation; rainfall interception); and 2) measuring changes in the soil water stock through <b>Time</b> <b>Domain</b> <b>Reflectometers</b> (TDR) probes.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, OTDRs have evolved from being used only as {{standalone}} measurement instruments with limited functionality to become key instruments for servicing and characterizing global fiber-optic communication links. This trend has spurred the creation of standard file formats for OTDR data and standard software interfaces to control OTDRs remotely. Optical <b>Time</b> <b>Domain</b> <b>Reflectometers</b> (OTDRs) have become key instruments for characterizing fiber-optic communication links. They are {{used to test the}} transmission performance of optical fibers by an optical pulse-response measurement method. During installation and maintenance of networks, OTDRs are primarily used to verify fiber and component parameters like optical loss and reflectance. The basic result from an OTDR measurement is the characteristic signature of the link called a trace, which is the amount of reflected light recorded versus time and distance. For an OTDR measurement, parameters such as pulse width, wavelength, range, and refractive index have to be defined. The trace can be postprocessed by a scantrace algorithm, which is used to detect faults, bad connections, and so on. Today, optical network operators are driven by the need for high-quality service and high flexibility for quickly evolving the network according to market needs. The ability to access information about the fiber plant is essential for configura-tion, fiber network upgrade, and cost-effective maintenance. Thus, many network operators archive installation data {{to be used as a}} reference for later comparisons during the lifetime of the network.

Understanding how pavement materials respond to traffic and environmental loading is fundamental to designing pavements and assessing their performance.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a numerical}} modeling study {{based on the}} findings of the two installed Permeable Interlocking Concrete Pavements (PICPs) in Louisville, KY and twenty one laboratory models. A new model derived to more accurately predict the captured surface runoff volume by the PICPs using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The proposed model relates rainfall parameters and site characteristics to the runoff volume captured by the permeable pavements. The database used for developing the prediction models is obtained from the collected data of the monitored permeable pavements. The performance of the ANN-based models are analyzed and the results demonstrate that the model results compare satisfactorily with measured values. A parametric study is completed to determine the sensitivity of a variety of parameters on the captured runoff volume. The results indicate that the developed model is capable of estimating the captured runoff by the permeable pavements for different rain events and site characteristics. The ANN model considers all significant contributing factors and provides a more precise volume prediction than the linear model. Clogging, which is mainly caused by sediment deposition, is the other important factor that result in performance failure of PICPs. Measuring Volumetric Water Content (VWC) by <b>Time</b> <b>Domain</b> <b>Reflectometers</b> (TDRs) is an automated method to track the speed of clogging. Monitoring peak VWC during rain events has been used as an indication of clogging progression over the PICP. Five ANN models are developed from the recorded VWC in order to compute the peak VWC from the rainfall parameters and maintenance treatment. A comprehensive set of data including various rain events characteristics obtained from the rain gauge and the conducted maintenance on the PICP are used for training and testing the neural network models. The performances of the ANN models are assessed and the results demonstrate satisfactory model accuracy when compared to the measured values. A parametric study was completed and the results indicate that the models are capable of estimating the peak VWC of the permeable pavements for different locations. The models consider all the contribution factors and provide more precise prediction values than the linear model. Peak 5 minute intensity, the previous rainfall depth, and the cumulative rainfall depth from the installation are the most critical parameters with respect to the hydrologic performance of the PICP. Finally, twenty one model configurations with different combinations of slope, gap size, and joint filling material were built to study clogging progression and permeable pavement performance. In this study, a neural network model was used to predict the clogging progression rate with critical PICP characteristics. The results indicate that the model is accurately predicting the extent of clogging along the length of permeable pavement. Sensitivity analyses are completed and the results suggest surface slope and location as the most influential parameters on the clogging length. Moreover, the prediction model for infiltration edge progression is presented to estimate the rainfall depth with 99 % accuracy on testing datasets. By predicting the precise cumulative rainfall depth based on the infiltration edge distance and the PICP specifications, the hydrologic operation for each configuration and at any rainfall depth is accessible. The results demonstrate that surface slope and gap size present the highest influence on the infiltration edge progression. By better understanding the effects of pavements’ specification and site characteristics and selecting the most efficient pavement configuration, improved future design and more effective maintenance operations can be achieved...|$|R
