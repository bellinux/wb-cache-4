Ketubot 103a) {{that the}} spirit of Rebbi Judah used to visit his home, wearing Shabbat clothes, every Friday evening at dusk. He would recite Kiddush, and others would thereby {{discharge}} their obligation to hear Kiddush. [...] One Friday night <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>at</b> the door.
