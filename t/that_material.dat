5|$|Biomass {{for heat}} and {{power is a}} fully mature {{technology}} which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, the industry has remained relatively stagnant over the decade to 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow in many developing countries. One {{of the problems of}} biomass is <b>that</b> <b>material</b> directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants, leading to severe health and environmental consequences, although improved cook stove programmes are alleviating some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Perseus at Pydna in 168BC, the Roman Senate allowed the reopening of iron and copper mines, but forbade the mining of gold and silver by the four newly {{established}} autonomous client states that replaced the monarchy in Macedonia. The law may originally have been conceived by the Senate due to the fear <b>that</b> <b>material</b> wealth gained from gold and silver mining operations would allow the Macedonians to fund an armed rebellion. The Romans were perhaps also concerned with stemming inflation caused by an increased money supply from Macedonian silver mining. The Macedonians continued minting silver coins between 167 and 148BC (i.e. just before {{the establishment of the}} Roman province of Macedonia), and when the Romans lifted the ban on Macedonian silver mining in 158BC it may simply have reflected the local reality of this illicit practice continuing regardless of the Senate's decree.|$|E

5|$|Based on estimations of the {{primordial}} mass required to form Uranus and Neptune, {{as well as}} bodies as large as Pluto (see below), earlier models of the Kuiper belt had suggested {{that the number of}} large objects would increase by a factor of two beyond 50AU, so this sudden drastic falloff, known as the Kuiper cliff, was unexpected, and to date its cause is unknown. In 2003, Bernstein, Trilling, et al. found evidence that the rapid decline in objects of 100km or more in radius beyond 50AU is real, and not due to observational bias. Possible explanations include <b>that</b> <b>material</b> at that distance was too scarce or too scattered to accrete into large objects, or that subsequent processes removed or destroyed those that did. Patryk Lykawka of Kobe University claimed that the gravitational attraction of an unseen large planetary object, perhaps the size of Earth or Mars, might be responsible.|$|E

5|$|LC filters at low {{frequencies}} become awkward; the components, especially the inductors, become expensive, bulky, heavy, and non-ideal. Practical 1H inductors require many {{turns on a}} high-permeability core; <b>that</b> <b>material</b> will have high losses and stability issues (e.g., a large temperature coefficient). For applications such as a mains filters, the awkwardness must be tolerated. For low-level, low-frequency, applications, RC filters are possible, but they cannot implement filters with complex poles or zeros. If the application can use power, then amplifiers {{can be used to}} make RC active filters that can have complex poles and zeros. In the 1950s, Sallen–Key active RC filters were made with vacuum tube amplifiers; these filters replaced the bulky inductors with bulky and hot vacuum tubes. Transistors offered more power-efficient active filter designs. Later, inexpensive operational amplifiers enabled other active RC filter design topologies. Although active filter designs were commonplace at {{low frequencies}}, they were impractical at high frequencies where the amplifiers were not ideal; LC (and transmission line) filters were still used at radio frequencies.|$|E
5|$|Literature {{published}} after 1900 {{contains many}} scattered descriptions of new color forms and subspecies. Of the 309 {{names in the}} nomenclatural list, 111 (35.9%) were published after Pilsbry (1900). Adolf Michael Zilch (1953) listed type specimens in the Senckenberg Museum, and illustrated many previously unfigured species. Frank Fortescue Laidlaw & Alan Solem (1961) recognized 74 species by name, and considered <b>that</b> <b>material</b> from the Banda Islands probably represented an undescribed species. Eleven of the species recognized by Laidlaw & Solem were described after the appearance of Pilsbry's monograph. However, several species recognized by Pilsbry have subsequently been subordinated to subspecific or varietal status, and a few names have been transferred to incertae sedis, since {{they are based on}} hundred-year-old references that have not been substantiated by more recent collectors. In fact, the study by Laidlaw & Solem (1961) forms a supplement to Pilsbry's monograph with his extensive plates, and many of Laidlaw & Solem's conclusions concerning the relationships of color forms described as species were taken not so much from new samples, but from the extent of variation that was outlined by Haniel (1921) in his pioneer study.|$|E
5|$|Observers {{hoped that}} the impacts would give them a first glimpse of Jupiter beneath the cloud tops, as lower {{material}} was exposed by the comet fragments punching through the upper atmosphere. Spectroscopic studies revealed absorption lines in the Jovian spectrum due to diatomic sulfur (S2) and carbon disulfide (CS2), the first detection of either in Jupiter, and only the second detection of S2 in any astronomical object. Other molecules detected included ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The amount of sulfur implied by the quantities of these compounds was {{much greater than the}} amount that would be expected in a small cometary nucleus, showing <b>that</b> <b>material</b> from within Jupiter was being revealed.

5|$|Regardless of the {{political}} relationship between Æthelberht and the Franks, there is abundant evidence of strong connections across the English Channel. There was a luxury trade between Kent and the Franks, and burial artefacts found include clothing, drink, and weapons that reflect Frankish cultural influence. The Kentish burials have a greater range of imported goods {{than those of the}} neighbouring Anglo-Saxon regions, which is not surprising given Kent's easier access to trade across the English Channel. In addition, the grave goods are both richer and more numerous in Kentish graves, implying <b>that</b> <b>material</b> wealth was derived from that trade. Frankish influences also may be detected in the social and agrarian organization of Kent. Other cultural influences may be seen in the burials as well, so {{it is not necessary to}} presume that there was direct settlement by the Franks in Kent.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{transferred}} by Vincent Hustad and colleagues {{to the newly}} created genus Glutinoglossum in 2013 when molecular analysis revealed that it and the species G.heptaseptatum formed a well-defined clade in the Geoglossaceae. In 2015, Hustad and Andrew Miller published an emended description of G.glutinosum with a narrower range of spore dimensions, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>material</b> collected in Australia and New Zealand represent unique species, which they referred to G.australasicum and G.exiguum. These species, along with G.americanum and G.methvenii, were added to Glutinoglossum in 2015. Hustad and Miller noted their new spore size range for G.glutinosum were more closely aligned with those given by Durand in his measurements of Persoon's type specimen.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{there has}} been {{uncertainty}} {{as to whether the}} European species known as Battarrea stevenii is a unique species or merely a polymorphic variant of B.phalloides. The taxon has been described as both a variety (as B.phalloides var. stevenii by Cleland and Cheel in 1916) and as a form (as B.phalloides f. stevenii by Calonge in 2004). In 1995, mycologist Roy Watling opined that B.stevenii differs in having spores that are colored more orange-tawny, slightly larger (5–6.5 by 5.75–7µm, as opposed to 4.5–5.25 by 4.5–5.75µm), and less ornamented. Further, B.stevenii is thought to have a larger fruit body size, a more coarsely scaly stipe, and lack of mucilage in the volva and the innermost parts of the stem. The presence or absence of mucilage has been traditionally considered the significant characteristic separating the species. In 1904, Lászlo Hollós proposed the idea of a single polymorphic species; in 1942, Paul Marshall Rea, after studying 25 specimens from southern California, concluded that B.stevenii was conspecific with B.phalloides and represented a single species. An analysis of a number of European specimens—using both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics in addition to molecular analysis of ITS regions of the 5.8S rDNA—also suggested both to be conspecific. The authors of this study considered the differences in spore ornamentation and stipe hyphae to be insufficient to discriminate them as two species; they did, however, note that their inability to locate the type material for both species limited the conclusiveness of their suggestion. The conspecificity of the species was supported in a later study that used traditional and molecular methods to compare field-collected English specimens and an extensive range of herbarium material collected from around the world. They found <b>that</b> <b>material</b> labeled B.stevenii generally had a greater range of cap and stem sizes, while that labeled B.phalloides was generally more consistent, and smaller. However, the B.phalloides material they studied was generally from similar habitats in the UK, while the B.stevenii material originated {{from a wide variety of}} locales and habitats, suggesting that environmental factors influence fruit body morphology. Evidence pointing to conspecificity included the continuum of spore sizes between the two, and the lack of any significant differences between their DNA. In 2006, however, based on a study of specimens collected in China, other scientists considered them to be independent species.|$|E
