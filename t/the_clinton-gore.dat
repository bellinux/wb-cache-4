5|$|Through {{his opinion}} pieces and {{political}} fundraising, Ijaz has advocated for {{the integration of}} Muslims into the American political mainstream. He raised significant amounts for various Democratic Party causes during the 1990s when President Clinton had {{paved the way for}} minority communities to become more active in U.S. politics, encouraging fellow Pakistani and Muslim Americans to join his fundraising efforts along the way. In 1996, Ijaz raised or contributed more than $525,000 for <b>the</b> <b>Clinton-Gore</b> re-election campaign, bringing Ijaz into close proximity with Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Clinton as well as other Clinton administration national security officials with whom he would later engage on Sudan, Kashmir and Pakistan's nuclear program.|$|E
5|$|Fund-raising for {{the center}} was led by Terry McAuliffe, a friend of Clinton's who had also contributed heavily to <b>the</b> <b>Clinton-Gore</b> {{campaign}} in 1995. Clinton himself was prohibited by law from personally soliciting donations {{for the center}}, but he did host private events relating to the library. There were no other legal restrictions on donations, and the Clinton Foundation was able to accept unlimited private donations, {{all of which were}} tax deductible. Approximately $10 million of contributions came from Saudi Arabia. However, the Clinton Foundation declined to release a full donor list, similar to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library (although the foundation later agreed to disclose the top 150 donors to the House Government Reform Committee). Donations exceeding $1 million were also given from various other foreign governments (such as Kuwait and Taiwan), as well as foreign individuals. Various American organizations also contributed millions of dollars to the foundation.|$|E

500|$|During the {{election}} and his term as Vice President, Gore popularized the term Information Superhighway, which became synonymous with the Internet, and {{he was involved in}} the creation of the National Information Infrastructure. Gore first discussed his plans to emphasize information technology at UCLA on January 11, 1994, in a speech at The Superhighway Summit. He was involved in a number of projects including NetDay'96 and 24 Hours in Cyberspace. <b>The</b> <b>Clinton–Gore</b> administration also launched the first official White House website in 1994 and subsequent versions through 2000. The Clipper Chip, which [...] "Clinton inherited from a multi-year National Security Agency effort", was a method of hardware encryption with a government backdoor. It met with strong opposition from civil liberty groups and was abandoned by 1996.|$|E

500|$|A {{secondary}} {{question of}} the Filegate controversy revolved around what the Office of Personnel Security was, who had authorized the hiring of Livingstone, and whether he was qualified for the job. [...] The Office was not responsible for actual White House security, as that was the charge of the United States Secret Service, nor did it perform background checks on potential White House employees, a task done by the FBI, nor did it keep the regular personnel files of employees, which were held in a different office within the White House. Rather, its role was {{to keep track of}} who was employed by the White House, make sure their security clearances were up to date, and give security briefings to new hires. [...] Nevertheless, Livingstone seemed to lack qualifications for even this position; he had worked on a number of Democratic Party campaigns and transitions, including being an advance man for <b>the</b> <b>Clinton-Gore</b> 1992 campaign, and his only prior job in the [...] "security" [...] field was that of a local bar bouncer at a Washington, D.C., night club. (At the congressional hearings, Livingstone objected to [...] "false and unfair caricatures of who I am. [...] I have worked hard for little or no pay in political campaigns for candidates who I felt would make this country a better place to live." [...] In later years Livingstone would continue to maintain on the internet that he had been qualified for the position, that the First Lady had signed off on hiring him, and that his character had been maligned by the general media). Clinton opponents stated that Livingstone had the highest level of security clearances in the U.S. government. White House officials could not explain why Livingstone was hired, nor who had hired him.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Clinton-Gore</b> {{administration}} {{launched the}} first official White House website on 21 October 1994. It would be followed by three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000. The White House website {{was part of a}} general movement by this administration towards web-based communication: [...] "Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system, and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America's government to more of America's citizens than ever before. On 17 July 1996. President Clinton issued Executive Order 13011 – Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to fully utilize information technology to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public." ...|$|E
2500|$|From Balclutha, {{the highway}} turns west, veering briefly north as it heads inland {{to avoid the}} rough hills of The Catlins. It passes through {{the small town of}} Clinton before {{reaching}} the major provincial town of Gore. Because of the names of these two towns, this stretch of the highway was christened [...] "The Presidential Highway" [...] during the time of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton-Gore</b> administration in the United States. At Gore the highway crosses the Mataura River; from here the road again turns south to roughly follow the river. The highway passes through Mataura before turning west at Edendale. Many travellers choose to turn onto SH 93 at Clinton, as this route offers a shorter journey between Clinton and Mataura and bypasses Gore. Over its last stretch the road veers southwest before reaching the city of Invercargill. In central Invercargill it meets the southern end of SH 6 and turns due south, skirting the estuary of the New River and Bluff Harbour. It passes through the small town of Bluff before reaching its terminus at Stirling Point, a kilometre south of Bluff. A commemorative signpost at Stirling Point indicates distances to major world centres and {{to the start of the}} highway at Picton.|$|E
50|$|The case {{involved}} $885,000 given from union general treasury to <b>the</b> 1996 <b>Clinton-Gore</b> campaign {{in exchange for}} the Clinton campaign's contributions to Ron Carey's re-election fund. Carey was running to keep the job of Teamsters union president. The exchange was an illegal swap that later resulted in a federal court's voiding of Carey's slim election victory against now Teamster President James P. Hoffa.|$|R
5000|$|The {{convention}} ran smoothly overall, and the Dole-Kemp team {{seemed to}} benefit {{in the short}} term.

However, this bump was extremely temporary, and they continued to trail <b>the</b> incumbent <b>Clinton-Gore</b> team; they went on to lose the election by almost nine points.|$|R
25|$|Berger {{served as}} Senior Foreign Policy Advisor to Governor Clinton during the campaign, and as Assistant Transition Director for National Security of <b>the</b> 1992 <b>Clinton-Gore</b> Transition. Berger served eight {{years on the}} National Security Council staff, first from 1993 - 1997 as deputy {{national}} security advisor, under Anthony Lake, whom Berger had recommended for the role, and then succeeding Lake as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs from 1997 to 2001.|$|R
2500|$|The {{donation}} kickback scheme {{which led}} to Carey's eventual expulsion from the Teamsters was created in July 1996. Early internal Carey re-election campaign polls showed Carey losing badly to Hoffa. Hoffa was also out-raising Carey in funds by more than 4-to-1, and the Carey campaign and outside fund-raising consultants were convinced much of Hoffa's funds were coming from organized crime sources. Carey re-election campaign aides, however, were confident Carey could win if he could bypass the local leadership (which supported Hoffa) and get his message directly to Teamsters members. In late July, Carey campaign manager Jere Nash met with Martin Davis, who owned The November Group (a direct-marketing company). Nash and Davis concluded a direct mail and phone bank effort would cost $700,000, money the Carey campaign did not have. Nash agreed to raise $300,000 and Davis agreed to raise the rest. Davis sought out fund-raiser Michael Ansara to brainstorm ways to raise the funds. On October 6, Ansara went to California and met with 300 wealthy donors to liberal causes. One of those donors was a major fund-raiser for Citizen Action, a coalition of left-wing public interest organizations with chapters in 24 states. The donor and Ansara hatched a plan: [...] In exchange for a $475,000 donation to Citizen Action, the Carey campaign would get a $100,000 donation from Citizen Action and Citizen Action would pay $75,000 to Ansara. Meanwhile, Davis contacted AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer Richard Trumka and allegedly concocted a scheme whereby the Teamsters would donate $150,000 to the AFL-CIO for spurious get-out-the-vote efforts and the AFL-CIO would pay the same amount to Citizen Action. Citizen Action would then pay $100,000 to The November Group, which would use the cash to finance Carey's direct marketing effort. Davis also met with members of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton-Gore</b> campaign, and suggested that the Teamsters would make major donations to Democratic state parties if wealthy donors (who, for whatever reason, might be prohibited by law from donating to political parties) would make donations to the Carey re-election bid. The Teamsters donated $236,500 to Democratic state parties, but when no acceptable donations {{were made to the}} Carey campaign by the wealthy donors the scheme fell apart and no donation exchanges were made.|$|E
