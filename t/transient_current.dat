Based on his understanding of electromagnets, he expected that, when current started to flow in one wire, a sort of wave would travel through the ring and cause some electrical effect on the opposite side. He plugged one wire into a galvanometer, and watched it as he connected the other wire to a battery. He saw a <b>transient</b> <b>current,</b> which he called a [...] "wave of electricity", when he connected the wire to the battery and another when he disconnected it. This induction {{was due to the}} change in magnetic flux that occurred when the battery was connected and disconnected. Within two months, Faraday found several other manifestations of electromagnetic induction. For example, he saw transient currents when he quickly slid a bar magnet {{in and out of a}} coil of wires, and he generated a steady (DC) current by rotating a copper disk near the bar magnet with a sliding electrical lead ("Faraday's disk").|$|E

40|$|AbstractClC- 5 is a Cl−/H+ antiporter that {{functions}} in endosomes and {{is important for}} endocytosis in the proximal tubule. The mechanism of transport coupling and voltage dependence in ClC- 5 is unclear. Recently, a transport-deficient ClC- 5 mutant (E 268 A) was shown to exhibit <b>transient</b> capacitive <b>currents.</b> Here, we studied the external and internal Cl− and pH dependence of the currents of E 268 A. <b>Transient</b> <b>currents</b> were almost completely independent of the intracellular pH. Even though the <b>transient</b> <b>currents</b> are modulated by extracellular pH, we could exclude that they are generated by proton-binding/unbinding reactions. In contrast, the charge movement showed a nontrivial dependence on external chloride, strongly supporting a model in which the movement of an intrinsic gating charge {{is followed by the}} voltage-dependent low-affinity binding of extracellular chloride ions. Mutation of the external Glu- 211 (a residue implicated in the coupling of Cl− and proton transport) to aspartate abolished steady-state transport, but revealed <b>transient</b> <b>currents</b> that were shifted by ∼ 150  mV to negative voltages compared to E 268 A. This identifies Gluext as a major component of the gating charge underlying the <b>transient</b> <b>currents</b> of the electrogenic ClC- 5 transporter.

Voltage pulses 40 ms in duration were made from a holding potential of - 40 mV to command potentials over the range - 160 to + 60 mV in increments of 20 mV. Current records (averaged 20 X; sampled every 200 microseconds) {{in the presence of}} dihydroouabain (DHO) or absence of external Na+ (Nao) were subtracted from current records obtained under Na/Na exchange conditions, i. e. internally perfused with 50 mM Na+, 5 mM ATP, and 5 mM ADP (K(+) -free) and externally superfused with 100 mM Na+,K(+) -free solution. <b>Transient</b> <b>currents</b> were dependent on intracellular Na+ and nucleotides, and diminished by activation of forward pumping; they were also reduced by 10 micrograms ml- 1 of oligomycin B applied to the external solution. These properties of the pre-steady state currents are consistent with the Na/K pump operating in its electroneutral Na/Na exchange mode. The voltage dependence of the DHO- and Nao-sensitive <b>transient</b> <b>currents</b> was analyzed using a pseudo two-state model in which only the rate coefficient for Nao-binding/reocclusion is voltage-dependent (Rakowski, R.

The apparent valence of the charge moved during the on (zq-on) and off (zq-off) of the pulse were 0. 96 +/- 0. 05 and 0. 95 +/- 0. 05 for Nao-sensitive, and 1. 10 +/- 0. 07 and 0. 85 +/- 0. 06 for DHO-sensitive <b>transient</b> <b>currents,</b> respectively. The total amount of charge moved (Qtot) and the mid-point voltage of the charge distribution (Vq) were 230 +/- 15 pC and - 56. 2 +/- 5. 1 mV, and 268 +/- 34 pC and - 67. 0 +/- 7. 6 mV for Nao- and DHO-sensitive <b>transient</b> <b>currents,</b> respectively.

50|$|As CssII is a β-toxin, it binds to site 4 on {{the sodium}} channel, thus {{primarily}} affecting the voltage sensor {{domain of the}} channel. It is thought that CssII binding to the voltage sensor domain is dependent on a conformational change of the sodium channel. The binding to site 4 induces a negative shift in voltage dependence, resulting in the aberrant opening of sodium channels. In addition, CssII reduces the peak <b>transient</b> <b>current</b> of the Nav1.6 channels, and causes the occurrence of resurgent currents in cells that otherwise would not exhibit this behavior. These effects might arise from different channel binding sites for CssII, as the effects on the resurgent current occur earlier than the left shift of activation, and the transient peak current reduction. However, these additional binding sites {{have not yet been}} defined. Also, CssII might indirectly affects the reuptake of GABA.

40|$|The patch-clamp {{technique}} {{in combination with}} a fast liquid filament application system was used to study the effect of dopamine on the glutamate receptor desensitization in horizontal cells of the perch (Perca fluviatilis). Kinetics of ligand-gated ion channels in fish horizontal cells are modulated by dopamine. This modulation is presumably mediated by a cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation. Before incubation with dopamine, the glutamate receptors of horizontal cells activate and desensitize with fast time constants. In the whole-cell recording mode, fast application of the agonists L-glutamate, quisqualate, or alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid prior to the dopamine incubation gives rise to fast <b>transient</b> <b>currents</b> with peak values of about 200 pA that desensitize within 100 ms. Kainate as agonist produced higher steady-state <b>currents</b> but no <b>transient</b> <b>currents.</b> After incubation of the cells with dopamine for 3 min, the desensitization was significantly reduced and the agonists L-glutamate, quisqualate, or alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid induced steady-state currents with amplitudes that were similar to the previously observed <b>transient</b> <b>currents.</b> Kainate-induced currents were only slightly affected. Fast desensitizing currents upon fast application of L-glutamate were also recorded from outside-out patches that were excised from horizontal cells before incubation with dopamine.

When the outside-out patches were excised from cells after dopamine incubation, steady-state currents were enhanced and no <b>transient</b> <b>currents</b> were observed. The results may indicate that the dopamine-dependent modulation of glutamate-induced currents, which is presumably mediated by a protein phosphorylation, is due to an alteration of the desensitization of the glutamate receptors...|$|R

When a voltage (electric field) {{is applied to}} the electrodes, positively charged conjugated and hydrated cations in the membrane molecular network are repulsed by the anode and migrate towards the negative electrode or the cathode carrying the hydrated water molecules with them. This migration creates an osmotic pressure gradient across the membrane causing the IPMC strip to bend or deform in a spectacular manner. On the other hand mechanically bending or deforming the IPMC strips causes the conjugated cations to move around and this creates an electric potential and output voltage and <b>transient</b> <b>current</b> ({{energy harvesting}}, sensing modes) based on the Poisson-Nernst-Planck field theories. Hydrated water molecules are bonded with cations as they migrate around.

50|$|A simple RC snubber uses a small {{resistor}} (R) {{in series}} with a small capacitor (C). This combination {{can be used to}} suppress the rapid rise in voltage across a thyristor, preventing the erroneous turn-on of the thyristor; it does this by limiting the rate of rise in voltage (dV/dt) across the thyristor to a value which will not trigger it. An appropriately-designed RC snubber can be used with either DC or AC loads. This sort of snubber is commonly used with inductive loads such as electric motors. The voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously, so a decreasing <b>transient</b> <b>current</b> will flow through it for a small fraction of a second, allowing the voltage across the switch to increase more slowly when the switch is opened. Determination of voltage rating can be difficult owing to the nature of transient waveforms, and may be defined simply by the power rating of the snubber components and the application. RC snubbers can be made discretely and are also built as a single component (see also Boucherot cell).|$|E
