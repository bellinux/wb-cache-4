5|$|In the 1970s, {{parts of}} the covertway and glacis were {{destroyed}} {{to make way for}} large storage tanks. Today, <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> still more or less intact, but some parts are in a rather dilapidated state and in need of restoration.|$|E
5|$|There are six Metro Rail lines. Each line is {{associated}} with a color; five of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> named for their color, while the sixth, the Expo Line, is named for Exposition Park.|$|E
5|$|The comb-line filter {{is similar}} to the {{interdigital}} filter in that it lends itself to mechanical assembly in a metal case without dielectric support. In the case of the comb-line, all <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> short-circuited at the same end rather than alternate ends. The other ends are terminated in capacitors to ground, and the design is consequently classified as semi-lumped. The chief advantage of this design is that the upper stopband can be made very wide, that is, free of spurious passbands at all frequencies of interest.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of , <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> called a passing (or exterior) <b>line,</b> if [...] <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> a tangent <b>line,</b> and if [...] <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> a secant <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|Passenger {{services}} on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>were</b> closed around 1990. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{one of two}} remaining east-west lines in Schleswig-Holstein. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> a possible detour route of military strategic importance.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> quadrupled in 1903. In 1925 <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> electrified.|$|R
5|$|The {{originality}} of {{this document}} remains {{a matter of}} debate. Hans K. Schulze and Hans Goetting believe that the document was presented by Otto II at their wedding feast, and then given to Theophanu. Interpreter Walter Deeters says that the separations in the text act as reading aids, showing that the document {{was intended to be}} read. Diplomats Theodor von Sickel and Carlrichard Brühl believe that the document is not the original as it lacks a seal and <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> unusually shaped.|$|E
5|$|Seven of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> {{operated}} by the Norwegian State Railways, owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, while the Gjøvik Line is {{operated by}} the NSB-owned NSB Gjøvikbanen. The operating deficit is covered by the state for NSB's lines, while NSB Gjøvikbanen's routes are financed by a public service obligation. The trains have two sections, manned and unmanned. Validated ticket-holders can travel in the unmanned section, which have orange doors. Manned sections, with gray doors, have a conductor and allow passengers to purchase tickets. Tickets are available at ticket machines at stations; if bought inboard, there is a 20 Norwegian krone (NOK) surcharge.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of commercial sound cinema had proceeded {{in fits and}} starts before The Jazz Singer, and the film's success did not change things overnight. Not until May 1928 did the group of four big studios (PDC had dropped out of the alliance), along with United Artists and others, sign with ERPI for conversion of production facilities and theaters for sound film. Initially, all ERPI-wired theaters were made Vitaphone-compatible; most were equipped to project Movietone reels as well. However, even with access to both technologies, most of the Hollywood companies remained slow to produce talking features of their own. No studio besides Warner Bros. released even a part-talking feature until the low-budget-oriented Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) premiered The Perfect Crime on June 17, 1928, eight months after The Jazz Singer. FBO had come under the effective control of a Western Electric competitor, General Electric's RCA division, which was looking to market its new sound-on-film system, Photophone. Unlike Fox-Case's Movietone and De Forest's Phonofilm, which were variable-density systems, Photophone was a variable-area system—a refinement in the way the audio signal was inscribed on film that would ultimately become the standard. (In both sorts of systems, a specially-designed lamp, whose exposure to the film is determined by the audio input, is used to record sound photographically as a series of minuscule lines. In a variable-density process, <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> of varying darkness; in a variable-area process, <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> of varying width.) By October, the FBO-RCA alliance would lead to the creation of Hollywood's newest major studio, RKO Pictures.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{opened in}} 1891 in the Bosnian gauge of 760mm. From 1963 <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> realigned and rebuilt to Standard gauge. Parts of <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>line</b> <b>were</b> flooded by <b>the</b> {{creation of the}} a number of Hydroelectric dams along the river. <b>The</b> standard gauge <b>line</b> <b>was</b> officially opened on 26 and 27 November 1966. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> electrified in 1969.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> 12.5 km {{long and}} has a rail gauge of [...] The first 5.5 km of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> {{operated}} by conventional rail adhesion. The remainder of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> operated as a rack railway, using the Abt system and with a maximum gradient of 15%. In total <b>the</b> <b>line</b> overcomes a height difference of 1062 m. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> electrified with an overhead supply at 1500 V DC.|$|R
50|$|After that <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{only served}} by freight trains until <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{electrified}} {{as part of}} a wider scheme, and Theobalds Grove station reopened to passengers on 21 November 1960. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> now known as the Southbury Loop.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} table {{presents the}} eleven {{lines of the}} Oslo Metro. They are chronologically sorted by {{the date of the}} first section of line to open. The service column indicates which of the six numbered services operates on most of the lines. Services are omitted from lines where they serve only one or two stations. The date indicates the official opening date of the line on the section noted in the fourth column. Sections with blue background indicate lines that were opened as tramways, while white background indicates the line was converted to or built as metro standard. The length column indicates the total length of the line at the time of opening or upgrade, and the extension column indicates the length of the extension. The station column indicates the number of stations on the line after the opening of each extension or upgrade. Unless specified otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> metro standard.|$|E
25|$|These metres {{are used}} in {{different}} proportions by the two playwrights. In Plautus, 47% of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> iambic, 43% trochaic, and 10% in other metres (mostly anapaestic, bacchiac, and cretic). In Terence, 75% of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> iambic, 24% trochaic, and only 1% in other metres (bacchiac and cretic).|$|E
25|$|In Nigeria, the Tiv {{ethnic group}} cut four lines into the abdomen of their girls during menarche. <b>The</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> {{supposed}} to represent fertility.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> 50.2 km {{long with}} 8 stations, from Pinghu, {{where it is}} linked to Guangshen railway, to Shekou West or Mawan (which are on {{different}} branches). <b>The</b> entire <b>line</b> <b>is</b> single-track and built at [...] The maximum speed on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> 75 km/h. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> not electrified, and therefore only diesel locomotives <b>are</b> used on <b>the</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|November 1: <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> {{extended}} from Maruko to Kamata, and <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> renamed to <b>the</b> Mekama <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like {{the rest}} of the Adelaide network, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> broad gauge. Dual gauge {{sleepers}} have been laid to allow for <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to <b>be</b> converted to standard gauge at a future date. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> 35.9 kilometres long and is the second longest of the Adelaide suburban railway <b>lines.</b> <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> double track throughout.|$|R
25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> skew, {{the sign}} of the result {{indicates}} the sense of crossing: positive if a right-handed screw takes L into L, else negative.|$|E
25|$|The order 2 biplane is the {{complement}} of the Fano plane: it has 7 points (and lines of size 4; a 2-(7,4,2)), where <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> given as the complements of the (3-point) {{lines in the}} Fano plane.|$|E
25|$|Two {{types of}} metro trains are {{used on the}} lines of the Prague Metro: 81-71M (a {{completely}} modernized variant of the original 81-71) and from 2000 new Metro M1. All <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> controlled automatically from the central dispatching, near I.P. Pavlova station.|$|E
50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{partially}} lifted after closure, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{in need of}} {{a complete}} rebuild.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> {{single track}} from Woodville to Grange with no passing loops over its entire length. All {{stations}} on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>are</b> unattended and have only very basic passenger waiting facilities. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> 5.5 kilometres long and broad gauge (1600mm).|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{opened in}} 1897, and was {{initially}} operated as a water counterbalance funicular. In 1969, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> automated, {{still as a}} water counterbalance funicular. In 1982, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt and converted to electric operation, with new cabins and stations.|$|R
25|$|Broad optical {{emission}} lines. These {{come from}} cold material {{close to the}} central black hole. <b>The</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> broad because the emitting material is revolving around the black hole with high speeds causing a range of Doppler shifts of the emitted photons.|$|E
25|$|In practice, the Tokaido, Sanyo and Kyushu lines form a {{contiguous}} west/southbound {{line from}} Tokyo, as train services run between the Tokaido and Sanyo lines {{and between the}} Sanyo and Kyushu lines, though <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> operated by different companies.|$|E
25|$|A few {{remnants}} of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> still visible. The {{ruins of the}} Fort of Santa Bárbara have been excavated, and substantial fragments of the fort's foundations can be seen within a small park. Some remains of the Fort of San Felipe have also been uncovered.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Ila <b>Line</b> (Ilalinjen) <b>is</b> tramway between Trondheim Torg and Ila in Trondheim, Norway. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> part of <b>the</b> {{original}} Trondheim Tramway {{and opened}} in 1901, and replaced the horse omnibus service from 1893. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> closed in 1988, {{but part of}} it was reopened in 1990 when <b>the</b> Gråkall <b>Line</b> <b>was</b> reborn. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> northernmost tramway in the world and is meter gauge.|$|R
25|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> {{built on}} <b>the</b> {{path of the}} former Metropolitan Goods railway <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{extended}} in stages between 1997 and 2014. Operation and maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> contracted to <b>the</b> ALTRAC Light Rail consortium by Transport for New South Wales, a statutory authority of the New South Wales Government. Services on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>are</b> operated by Transdev Sydney {{as a member of}} ALTRAC Light Rail.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{lifted in}} <b>the</b> later 1960s after <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> used for <b>the</b> {{construction}} of the new Harecastle Tunnel. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> used as <b>the</b> diversion route from the Mainline at Longport to <b>the</b> loop <b>line</b> and back on the mainline north of Kidsgrove.|$|R
25|$|One of Club Penguin's plays, Twelfth Fish, is a spoof of Shakespeare's works. It is a {{story about}} a countess, a jester, and a bard who catch a fish that talks. As the play ends, they begin eating the fish. Many of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> parodies of Shakespeare.|$|E
25|$|The glider wing is {{made from}} Porcher Marine Skytex 44 g/m2 nylon fabric. The rib {{reinforcements}} are 310 g/m2 Dacron, with the trailing edge reinforcement fabricated of 175 g/m2 polyester. <b>The</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> all sheathed Kevlar and 1.1 and 1.7mm in diameter or, optionally, 0.6 and 0.9mm micro unsheathed lines. The risers are made from 20mm wide Polyamida strapping.|$|E
25|$|In Plautus, 37% of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> unaccompanied iambic senarii, but in Terence 56%. More than 4% of Plautus's {{lines are}} anapaestic, but this metre {{is not used}} at all in Terence. The trochaic septenarius is much {{commoner}} in Plautus (41%) than in Terence (22%). The trochaic octonarius is slightly more frequent in Terence (1.5%) than in Plautus (0.6%).|$|E
50|$|The {{junction}} {{closed in}} 1986 as <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{not being used}} any more even for freight. In 1988, the tracks were disconnected {{at both ends of}} <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> tracks remained, overgrown, for over 18 years until 2007 when <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> dismantled and <b>the</b> area where <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> was concreted over.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> opened between Caboolture and Woodford in 1909. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{extended}} to Kilcoy in 1913. [...] <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> closed in 1964.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{closed to}} all traffic by British Railways on 5 January 1969. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{dismantled}} in 1971.|$|R
