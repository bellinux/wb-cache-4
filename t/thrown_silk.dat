50|$|<b>Thrown</b> <b>silk</b> is twisted single filament. There {{is a lot}} {{of waste}} from {{processing}} and damaged cocoons. Silk is expensive and ways were found to recover the waste. The waste was cut into fibres 25-50mm long and then these were spun like worsted or cotton using a throstle. This was 'short Silk'. Such a short thread produced a silk with an inferior lustre. In 1836 Gibson and Campbell patented a 'Long Silk' machine for spinning staples up to 250mm. Carding and combing (known as dressing) remained a problem until Lister invented the self-acting dressing machine in 1877. Spun silk is softer than <b>thrown</b> <b>silk</b> and easily blended with other fibres. Silk spinning became an important industry in Congleton: taking place in Stonehouse Green and Brooks Mill, Forge Mill and Bath Vale. Brocklehursts continued long silk spinning in Macclesfield until the 1950s.|$|E

The industry had burgeoned after the Civil War: only four of the thirty four silk exhibitors (representing America 2 ̆ 7 s two hundred twenty four silk manufacturers and dealers) could trace their origins to the 2 ̆ 2 times which tried the souls of the silk producers and manufacturers. 2 ̆ 2 The Nonotuck Silk Company, the unlikely descendant of the 18302 ̆ 7 s moth-to-cloth Northampton Silk Company, was one that could and did. After falling twice from the rickety carousel of early nineteenth century enterprises, it seized the brass ring and held on. The key to its success was its manufacture of the first usable 2 ̆ 2 machine twist, 2 ̆ 2 a silk thread strong and smooth enough to withstand the unprecedented demands of the newly invented sewing machine. Nonotuck became one of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s leading silk thread manufactures and Northampton 2 ̆ 7 s largest employer for decades. Yet the details of this key invention have never been spelled out. This paper attempts to fill that gap. The sericulture years: 1830 - 1850. The story begins, not in 1838 as the trade card suggests, but eight years earlier, when Samuel Whitmarsh, a 30 -year-old Boston native, bought a large estate near the center of Northampton with the proceeds of a successful tailoring business in New York and built cocoonery for two million silkworms and two greenhouses for mulberry shoots next to his mansion. Raising silkworm was a popular spring pastime in Northampton in the 18202 ̆ 7 s; Whitmarsh tugged the silkworm from cottage to factory, from hobby to industry. A former linseed oil mill three miles three miles to the north along the Mill River served as his first factory. A few years later, backed by a group of New York and Connecticut financiers, Whitmarsh built a four-story brick one nearby. The new 7 factory hummed with up-to-the-minute machinery. Tourists flocked to see his power loom churn out silk ribbons and vesting. The Northampton Silk Company was incorporated in 1838. But some whispered that the manufacture was mostly a show to persuade the gullible to invest in mulberry trees, whose price increased tenfold in a few short years. The Northampton Silk Company burst with the mulberry bubble. Bankrupt, Whitmarsh withdrew in 1840. Out but not down, he tried, again unsuccessfully, to establish a silk industry in Jamaica a few years later. At the time of his death, in Northampton in 1875, he was planning to raise silk in California...|$|E

Lamech Swift became the sub-tenant in 1780 paying an annual rent of £7 to the corporation and £170 to Thomas Wilson, brother of Richard and William. Despite a row with the corporation over repairs to the weirs in 1781, he remained in occupation until the lease expired in 1803 when the corporation advertised a lease to run for 60 years.

50|$|The mill was {{constructed}} in 1800 by Henry Hayter on a plot of land called Frog Island. The mill is probably on the same site {{as one of the}} four mills recorded in the Domesday Book. Originally it was a fulling mill (part of the finishing process of cloth weaving). Some years later, in 1917, it was bought by William Madick who changed its operation to <b>throw</b> <b>silk.</b> In 1844 it was acquired by Alexander Bannerman and John Spencer, merchants of Manchester. William Chappell, the manager of the mill, purchased it from them in 1846. At this time the mill employed 108 staff, including 39 {{children under the age of}} 13. By 1866 the mill had passed into the ownership of the Hide family with whom it remained until the death of James Hide in 1955. It ultimately passed to Ede and Ravenscroft who operated it up to 1985, producing legal and academic gowns. It was then acquired by the Hampshire Buildings Preservation Trust who, after renovation works, opened it to the public in 1990.|$|R

The architect George Sorocold built it next to Thomas Cotchett's failed 1704 mill (which used copies of Dutch throwing machines) {{on the west bank}} of the River Derwent. He and his half brother Thomas Lombe, born 1685, instructed George Sorocold to build a mill for the Italian-style machines. To the north of the powered Italian Works an un-powered Doubling Shop was built at some time before 1739, and when this mill was sold in 1739 to Thomas Wilson an inventory taken which still exists today. Thomas Lombe was given a 14-year patent to protect the design of the throwing machines he used. The King of Sardinia responded to this challenge badly, and stopped exporting suitable raw silk. It is speculated that he was responsible for John Lombe's mysterious death six years later in 1722. His elder brother, Thomas Lombe, took over the business.|$|R

5|$|The katipo has {{medically}} significant venom in humans, although bites are rare. The {{incidence of}} bites is low {{as it is}} a shy, non-aggressive spider. Their narrow range, diminishing population, and human awareness of where they live means interaction between humans and the spider is minimal. The katipo will only bite as a last resort; if molested, the spider will usually fold up into a ball and drop to the ground or retreat to the nearest cover. If the threat continues, the spider may <b>throw</b> out <b>silk</b> against the interference. When restrained in any way or held against skin, such as if tangled up in clothing, the spider will then bite defensively. However, if the female is with an egg sac it will remain close by it and sometimes move offensively to bite any threat.|$|R

50|$|Silk is a {{naturally}} produced fibre obtained from {{many species of}} the silk moth. In 1700 the favoured silk was produced by a moth (Bombyx mori), that spun a cocoon to protect the larvae. The larvae fed on mulberry leaves grown in Italy. Silk fibres from the Bombyx mori silkworm have a triangular cross section with rounded corners, 5-10 μm wide. The silk is a protein, fibroin, that was cemented {{in place by the}} use of gum, another protein, sericin. The cocoons were harvested and placed in troughs of hot water to dissolve the gum and allowed the single thread to be wound into a skein. The skeins were placed into bales and taken to the mill for processing. Three sorts of yarn could be produced: no-twist which was suitable for weft, tram that had received a slight twist making it easier to handle, and organizine which had a greater twist and was suitable for use as warp. Reeling is the industrial process where silk that has been wound into skeins, is cleaned, receives a twist and is wound onto bobbins. <b>Silk</b> <b>throwing</b> is the process where the thread from the bobbins is twisted again to form tram and or organzine. The yarn is twisted together into threads, in a process known as doubling. Colloquially <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> can be used to refer to the whole process: reeling, throwing and doubling.|$|R
50|$|King Edward I granted {{permission}} {{to build a}} mill. Congleton became an important centre of textile production, especially leather gloves and lace. Congleton had an early <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> mill, the Old Mill built by John Clayton and Nathaniel Pattison in 1753. More mills followed, and cotton was also spun. The town's prosperity depended on tariffs imposed on imported silk. When tariffs were removed in the 1860s, the empty mills were converted to fustian cutting. A limited silk ribbon weaving industry survived into the 20th century, and woven labels were still produced in the 1990s. Many mills survive as industrial or residential units.|$|R
50|$|Silk weaving {{is known}} to have been carried out in Sicily in the tenth century, and in 1474 there were 15,000 {{employed}} in the industry in Milan. There is an illustration of a circular handpowered throwing machine drawn in 1487 with 32 spindles. The Italians called the throwing machine, a filatoio, and the doubler, a torcitoio. The first evidence of an externally powered filatoio comes from the thirteenth century, and the earliest illustration from around 1500. Bologna became the most technological advanced <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> town, with filatoio driven by overhead shafts that were powered by water.|$|R
50|$|In 1790 {{the weaving}} of silk was {{introduced}} into Macclesfield by Leigh and Voce who introduced looms, and Huguenot weavers {{to teach the}} skills, into a loomshop in Back Street. One of the weavers, Margaret Moborn was induced to leave and work for the James Pearson in a weaving shed in Sunderland Street. It was James's father George who had invited John Wesley to preach in Macclefield. Margaret lived with James for several years as well as teaching the principles of weaving and warping. George Pearson and Sons became the leading silk weavers here {{in the early nineteenth}} century. Britain was again at war with France between 1793 and 1815 so weaving prospered.
