25|$|During the 1980 recession, {{manufacturing}} shed 1.1million jobs, while {{service industries}} remained intact. Employment in automotive manufacturing in particular suffered, experiencing a 33% reduction {{by the end}} of the recession. Collectively these factors contributed to the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. The Federal Reserve once again began <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in 1981, which plunged the economy back into recession. Unemployment rose to a peak of 10.8% in December 1982, a post-war high.|$|E
25|$|During the Great Depression, {{every major}} {{currency}} abandoned {{the gold standard}}. Among the earliest, the Bank of England abandoned the gold standard in 1931 as speculators demanded gold in exchange for currency, threatening the solvency of the British monetary system. This pattern repeated throughout Europe and North America. In the United States, the Federal Reserve was forced <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{in order to protect}} the gold standard for the US dollar, worsening already severe domestic economic pressures. After bank runs became more pronounced in early 1933, people began to hoard gold coins as distrust for banks led to distrust for paper money, worsening deflation and depleting gold reserves.|$|E
25|$|The {{worldwide}} {{recession of}} the early 1990s significantly damaged the government's financial situation. Mulroney's inability to improve the government's finances, {{as well as his}} use of tax increases to deal with it, were major factors in alienating the western conservative portion of his power base – this contrasted with his tax cuts earlier as part of his 'pro-business' plan which had increased the deficit. At the same time, the Bank of Canada began <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in order to meet a zero inflation target; the experiment was regarded as a failure that exacerbated the effect of the recession in Canada. Annual budget deficits ballooned to record levels, reaching $42 billion in his last year of office. These deficits grew the national debt dangerously close to the psychological benchmark of 100% of GDP, further weakening the Canadian dollar and damaging Canada's international credit rating.|$|E
50|$|MDA {{is used in}} {{economics}} applications where the economists is often interested only in directional movement of variable of interest. As an example in macroeconomics, a monetary authority who likes to know {{the direction of the}} inflation, <b>to</b> <b>raises</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> or decrease the rates if inflation is predicted to rise or drop respectively. Another example can be found in financial planning where the user wants to know if the demand has increasing direction or decreasing trend.|$|R

Now {{it will be very}} difficult for bank to maintain profitability with such small capital. Bank will be left with no choice but <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> which will make borrowing costly. This will in turn reduce the overall demand & hence price will come down eventually.|$|R

25|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the price}} of gold is closely related to interest rates. As interest rates rise, the general tendency is for the gold price, which earns no interest, to fall, and vice versa. As a result, the gold price can be closely correlated to central banks via their monetary policy decisions on interest rates. For example, if market signals indicate the possibility of prolonged inflation, central banks may decide <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> which could reduce the price of gold. But this does not always happen: after the European Central Bank raised its interest rate slightly on April 7, 2011, {{for the first time since}} 2008, the price of gold drove higher, and hit a new high one day later. Similarly, in August 2011 when interest rates in India were at their highest in two years, the gold prices peaked as well.|$|E
2500|$|In this era, the {{experience}} of Great Britain and others was that the gold standard ran counter {{to the need to}} retain domestic policy autonomy. To protect their reserves of gold, countries would sometimes need <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and generally follow a deflationary policy. The greatest need for this could arise in a downturn, just when leaders would have preferred to lower rates to encourage growth. Economist Nicholas Davenport ...|$|E
2500|$|Currency {{speculation}} {{is considered a}} highly suspect activity in many countries. [...] While investment in traditional financial instruments like bonds or stocks often is considered to contribute positively to economic growth by providing capital, currency speculation does not; according to this view, it is simply gambling that often interferes with economic policy. For example, in 1992, currency speculation forced the Swedish National Bank (the central bank of Sweden) <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{for a few days}} to 500% per annum, and later to devalue the krona. Mahathir Mohamad, one of the former Prime Ministers of Malaysia, is one well-known proponent of this view. He blamed the devaluation of the Malaysian ringgit in 1997 on George Soros and other speculators.|$|E
50|$|Research by {{personnel}} at the Fed {{has resulted in}} claims that interest paid on reserves helps to guard against inflationary pressures. Under a traditional operating framework, in which central bank controls <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> by changing the level of reserves and pays no interest on excess reserves, it would need to remove almost all of these excess reserves <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> market <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Now when central bank pays interest on excess reserves {{the link between the}} level of reserves and willingness of commercial banks to lend is broken. It allows the central bank <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> market <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> by simply <b>raising</b> the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> it pays on reserves without changing the quantity of reserves thus reducing lending growth and curbing economic activity.|$|R

2500|$|In early 1833, Jackson, despite {{opposition}} from {{some members of}} his cabinet, decided to withdraw the Government's funds from the Bank. The incumbent Secretary of the Treasury, Louis McLane, a member of Jackson's [...] Cabinet, professed moderate support for the Bank. He therefore refused to withdraw the Federal funds directed by the President and would not resign, so Jackson then transferred him to the State Department. McLane's successor, William J. Duane, was also opposed to the Bank, but would not carry out Jackson's orders either. After waiting four months, President Jackson summarily dismissed Duane, replacing him with Attorney General Roger B. Taney as a recess appointment when Congress was out of session. In September 1833, Taney helped transfer the public deposits from the Bank to seven state-chartered banks. Faced {{with the loss of}} the Federal deposits, Biddle decided <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and deliberately induce a recession. A mild financial panic ensued from late 1833 to mid-1834. Intended to force Jackson into a compromise, the move backfired, increasing anti-Bank sentiment. Meanwhile, Biddle and other Bank supporters attempted to renew the Bank's charter though the Congress on numerous occasions. All their attempts failed under the threat of a Jackson presidential veto.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{construct}} a simple nonlinear model for the U. S. dollar- German mark (euro) real exchange rate. The central bank is shown to have an important role in the exchange rate system when the real exchange rate is measured by the CPI deflator. The monetary authority is assumed to follow a Taylor rule and <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> when the home currency is depreciated relative to its long-run PPP level. We use a nonmonotonic logistic smooth transition model to investigate a nonlinear adjustment towards the parity level. We begin our empirical part by examining the statistical properties of the data. The results of our analysis suggest that when allowing for a non-linear alternative the real exchange rate seems to follow a globally stationary process. The nonlinear model considered allows the adjustment towards long-run equilibrium to be sudden as well as smooth. We found that the adjustment is sudden. This is probably due to official announcements of the central banks. Furthermore, there is a symmetric and relatively large reference band around the parity level. This implies that the weight put on the U. S dollar-German mark (euro) real exchange rate in the monetary policy rules is low...|$|R
