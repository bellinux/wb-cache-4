50|$|Transmitters, {{receivers}} {{and other}} service circuits are in <b>Trunk</b> <b>Module</b> (TM) and Miscellaneous <b>Trunk</b> <b>Module</b> (MTM) shelves. Trunks are on DTC (Digital Trunk Controller) or DTCI (Digital Trunk Controller ISDN) or PDTC (PCM30 Digital Trunk Controller) shelves, usually two T-1 lines per card, ten cards per DTC {{for a total}} of 480 ds0 voice channels. At {{the turn of the century}} many original NT6X50AA cards were still in service that cannot perform T-carrier extended superframe signaling, this can be performed with a plug-in replacement NT6X50AB card, used for services such as PBX ISDN T1s. Trunks can also be provisioned on SPM (Spectrum Peripheral Module) capable of handling 2016 DS0s, nearly 4.2x more than the DTC.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the validity and test–retest reliability of trunk muscle strength testing performed with a latest-generation isokinetic dynamometer. Eccentric, isometric, and concentric peak torque of the trunk flexor and extensor muscles was measured in 15 healthy subjects. Muscle cross sectional area (CSA) and surface electromyographic (EMG) activity were respectively correlated to peak torque and submaximal isometric torque for erector spinae and rectus abdominis muscles. Reliability of peak torque measurements was determined during test and retest sessions. Significant correlations were consistently observed between muscle CSA and peak torque for all contraction types (r = 0. 74 À 0. 85; P < 0. 001) and between EMG activity and submaximal isometric torque (r P 0. 99; P < 0. 05), for both extensor and flexor muscles. Intraclass correlation coefficients were comprised between 0. 87 and 0. 95, and standard errors of measurement were lower than 9 % for all contraction modes. The mean difference in peak torque between test and retest ranged from À 3. 7 % to 3. 7 % with no significant mean directional bias. Overall, our findings establish the validity of torque measurements using the tested <b>trunk</b> <b>module.</b> Also considering the excellent test–retest reliability of peak torque measurements, we conclude that this latest-generation isokinetic dynamometer could be used with confidence to evaluate trunk muscle function for clinical or athletic purposes...|$|E
