40|$|Myotis nigricans is {{a species}} of vespertilionid bat, whose males show two periods of <b>total</b> tes-ticular <b>regression</b> within the same annual {{reproductive}} cycle in the northwest São Paulo State, Brazil. Studies have demonstrated that its epididymis has an elongation of the caudal portion, which stores spermatozoa {{during the period of}} testicular regression in July, but that they had no sperm during the regression in November. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the impact of the <b>total</b> testicular <b>regression</b> in the epididymal morphophysiology and patterns of its hormonal regulation. The results demonstrate a continuous activity of the epi-didymis from the Active to the Regressing periods; a morphofunctional regression of the epi-didymis in the Regressed period; and a slow recrudescence process. Thus, we concluded that the processes of <b>total</b> testicular <b>regression</b> and posterior recrudescence suffered by M. nigricans also impact the physiology of the epididymis, but with a delay in epididymal re-sponse. Epididymal physiology is regulated by testosterone and estrogen, through the pro-duction and secretion of testosterone by the testes, its conduction to the epididymis (mainly through luminal fluid), conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone by the 5 α-reductase enzyme (mainly in epithelial cells) and to estrogen by aromatase; and through the activation/ deactivation of the androgen receptor and estrogen receptor α in epithelial cells, which regu-late the epithelial cell morphophysiology, prevents cell death and regulates their protein ex-pression and secretion, which ensures the maturation and storage of the spermatozoa...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy {{applied to}} the locally {{advanced}} rectal cancer reduces local recurrence and improves survival. We assessed tumor regression grade (TRG) and its influence on survival in rectal cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection. Methods: We studied 108 patients that were seen at our hospital between August 2004 and December 2008. Patients received preoperative chemoradiotherapy consisting of 5 -fluorouracil and leucovorin by continous infusion during the first and fifth week, delivered with concurrent pelvic radiation of 50. 4 Gy, followed by radical surgery at 6 - 8 weeks. The TRG {{was determined by the}} amount of fibrosis in the tumor embedding area and was divided into 5 grades based on the relative amount of fibrosis. We analyzed all preoperative clinicopathologic factors, postoperative pathologic stages, TRG and prognosis, retrospectively. Results: Downstaging of rectal cancer through neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy occurred in 64 (59 %) patients. The numbers of <b>total</b> <b>regressions</b> (TRG 4), good regressions (TRG 3), moderate regressions (TRG 2), minor regressions (TRG 1), and no regression (TRG 0) were 19 (18 %), 65 (60 %), 17 (16 %), 6 (5 %), and 1 (1 %) respectively. The TRG was inversely correlated with perineural invasion and lymphovascular invasion (P = 0. 008, P = 0. 032).
