5|$|Tarrare crossed Prussian lines {{under cover}} of darkness, {{disguised}} as a German peasant. Unable to speak German, he soon {{attracted the attention of}} local residents, who alerted the Prussian authorities, and he was captured outside Landau. A strip search found nothing suspicious on his person, and despite being whipped by Prussian soldiers, he refused to betray his mission. Brought before the local Prussian commander, General Zoegli, he again refused to talk and was imprisoned. After 24 hours of captivity, Tarrare relented and explained the scheme to his captors. He was chained to a latrine, and eventually, 30 hours after being swallowed, the wooden box emerged. Zoegli was furious when the documents, which Tarrare had said contained vital intelligence, transpired only to be deBeauharnais's dummy message, and Tarrare was taken to a gallows and the noose placed around his neck. (Some sources state that Zoegli never retrieved the box, as Tarrare had <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> recover and eat the stool containing it before it could be seized by the Prussians.) At the last minute, Zoegli relented, and Tarrare was taken down from the scaffold, given a severe beating, and released near the French lines.|$|E
5|$|Staff Sergeant Leroy A. Petry {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} acts of gallantry and intrepidity {{at the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} in action with an armed enemy in the vicinity of Paktya Province, Afghanistan, on May 26, 2008. As a Weapons Squad Leader with D Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, Staff Sergeant Petry moved to clear the courtyard of a house that potentially contained high-value combatants. While crossing the courtyard, Staff Sergeant Petry and another Ranger were engaged and wounded by automatic weapons fire from enemy fighters. Still under enemy fire, and wounded in both legs, Staff Sergeant Petry led the other Ranger to cover. He then reported the situation and engaged the enemy with a hand grenade, providing suppression as another Ranger moved to his position. The enemy quickly responded by maneuvering closer and throwing grenades. The first grenade explosion knocked his two fellow Rangers to the ground and wounded both with shrapnel. A second grenade then landed only a few feet away from them. Instantly realizing the danger, Staff Sergeant Petry, unhesitatingly and with complete disregard for his safety, deliberately and selflessly moved forward, picked up the grenade, and in an effort to clear the immediate threat, threw the grenade away from his fellow Rangers. As he was releasing the grenade it detonated, amputating his right hand at the wrist and further injuring him with multiple shrapnel wounds. Although picking up and throwing the live grenade grievously wounded Staff Sergeant Petry, his gallant act undeniably saved his fellow Rangers from being severely wounded or killed. Despite the severity of his wounds, Staff Sergeant Petry continued to maintain <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> place a tourniquet on his right wrist before communicating the situation by radio in order to coordinate support for himself and his fellow wounded Rangers. Staff Sergeant Petry's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service, and reflect great credit upon himself, 75th Ranger Regiment, and the United States Army.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of Redbridges capture, Lemprière had aboard an {{unauthorised}} copy of the British naval signal book. At the time, officers below the rank of commander were forbidden by regulations to have such copies, but many did so. Unfortunately, Lemprière did not have <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> destroy the book before the French captured him. The French used the signals to try to lure into Toulon a British boat outside the harbour, but the captain,sensing something amiss, {{did not take the}} bait. When Nelson found out that the flags had been compromised he changed them and informed the Admiralty. On 4 November the Admiralty ordered all commanders-in-chief to change the numeral flags in accordance with a new pattern. The Admiralty also ordered that the commanders impound all other unauthorised copies.|$|E

25|$|Hathcock {{only once}} removed the white feather from his bush hat while {{deployed}} in Vietnam. During a volunteer mission {{days before the}} end of his first deployment, he crawled over 1,500 yards of field to shoot a high-ranking NVA officer. He was not informed of the details of the mission until he accepted it. This effort took four days and three nights, without sleep, of constant inch-by-inch crawling. Hathcock said he was almost stepped on as he lay camouflaged with grass and vegetation in a meadow shortly after sunset. At one point he was nearly bitten by a bamboo viper, but had <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> avoid moving and giving up his position. As the officer exited his encampment, Hathcock fired a single shot that struck the officer in the chest, killing him.|$|E
500|$|L'Estrange survived an {{even more}} {{disastrous}} attempt in Melbourne {{less than six months}} later at the grounds of the Agricultural Society in a balloon named Aurora. Having been supplied with a much higher quality gas from the Metropolitan Gas Company he miscalculated the speed at which the balloon would ascend. Having floated much higher than originally anticipated the balloon greatly expanded and a weak seam in the calico fabric suddenly burst. L'Estrange had <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> deploy the silk parachute which slowed the rate of descent. His landing was softened by a tree and although severely shaken, L'Estrange was uninjured. The whole journey took nine minutes. The [...] "catastrophe" [...] was widely reported with the story appearing in local newspapers in Adelaide, Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane within the week. This was the first emergency descent by parachute in Australia, predating the Caterpillar Club by over 50 years.|$|E
500|$|Shark {{sightings}} increased {{along the}} Mid-Atlantic Coast following the attacks. On July 8, armed motorboats patrolling {{the beach at}} Spring Creek chased an animal they {{thought to be a}} shark, and Asbury Park's Asbury Avenue Beach was closed after lifeguard Benjamin Everingham claimed to have beaten off a [...] long shark with an oar. Sharks were spotted near Bayonne, New Jersey; Rocky Point, New York; Bridgeport, Connecticut; Jacksonville, Florida; and Mobile, Alabama, and a columnist from Field & Stream captured a sandbar shark in the surf at Beach Haven. Actress Gertrude Hoffmann was swimming at the Coney Island beach shortly after the Matawan fatalities when she claimed to have encountered a shark. The New York Times noted that Hoffman [...] "had <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> remember that she had read in the Times that a bather can scare away a shark by splashing, and she beat up the water furiously." [...] Hoffman was certain {{she was going to be}} devoured by the [...] "Jersey man-eater", but later admitted she was [...] "not sure... whether she had had her trouble for nothing or had barely escaped death." ...|$|E

[...] Kate Claxton echoed J. B. Studley's line, and stage manager J. W. Thorpe appeared, also urging an orderly exit. But the audience was now thoroughly panicked and ignored the people on the stage.|$|E
2500|$|At the Battle of Chancellorsville, Stuart {{accompanied}} Stonewall Jackson on {{his famous}} flanking march of May 2, 1863, {{and started to}} pursue the retreating soldiers of the Union XI Corps when he received word that both Jackson and his senior division commander, Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill, had been wounded. Hill, bypassing the next most senior infantry general in the corps, Brig. Gen. Robert E. Rodes, sent a message ordering Stuart to take command of the Second Corps. Although the delays associated with this change of command effectively ended the flanking attack the night of May 2, Stuart performed credibly as an infantry corps commander the following day, launching a strong and well-coordinated attack against the Union right flank at Chancellorsville. When Union troops abandoned Hazel Grove, Stuart had <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> quickly occupy it and bombard the Union positions with artillery. Stuart relinquished his infantry command on May 6 when Hill returned to duty. Stephen W. Sears wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{influence}} on Woolf was the American writer Henry David Thoreau, with Woolf {{writing in a}} 1917 essay that her aim as a writer was to follow Thoreau by capturing [...] "the moment, to burn always with this hard, gem-like flame" [...] while praising Thoreau for his statement [...] "The millions are awake enough for physical labor, but only one in hundreds of millions is awake enough to a poetic or divine life. To be awake is to be alive". Woolf praised Theoreau for his [...] "simplicity" [...] in finding [...] "a way for settling free the delicate and complicated machinery of the soul". Like Thoreau, Woolf {{believed that it was}} silence that set the mind free to really contemplate and understand the world. Both authors believed in a certain transcendental, mystical approach to life and writing, where even banal things could be capable of generating deep emotions if one had enough silence and <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> appreciate them. Woolf and Thoreau were both concerned with the difficulty of human relationships in the modern age.|$|E

2500|$|Hodgson {{decided to}} leave the series halfway through Season Five due to his dislike of being on-camera and his {{disagreements}} with producer Mallon over creative control of the program. Hodgson also stated that Mallon's insistence to produce a feature film version of the show led to his departure, giving up his rights on the MST3K property to Mallon. Hodgson later told an interviewer: [...] "If I had <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> try and work it out, I would rather have stayed. 'Cause I didn't want to go, it just seemed like I needed to." [...] Though they held casting calls for a replacement for Hodgson on camera, the crew found that none of the potential actors really fit the role; instead, having reviewed a test run that Nelson had done with the 'bots, the crew agreed that having Nelson (who had already appeared in guest roles on the show) replace Hodgson would be the least jarring approach. [...] The replacement of Joel by Mike would lead to an oft-jokingly [...] "Joel vs Mike flame war" [...] among fans, similar to the [...] "Kirk vs Picard" [...] discussions in the Star Trek fandom.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the first}} {{indication}} of Lily's strength of character comes from November 1885, when she was twelve years old. One day, [...] "Miss May Harris, with her two little sisters, Violet and Lily, and Miss Gaynor, a guest, {{went down to the}} beach to bathe, and a little while afterwards Mrs. Harris followed them down to look after them. On her way to the beach, and when, a little way only from it, her attention was caught by some brushwood and dry grass which she thought might harbour snakes. She accordingly set fire to it with the hope of removing it, and was still engaged in the operation, when she suddenly – the fire having spread without her noticing it – found that her dress had caught ablaze, and that the sleeves were burning. This was the first intimation she had of her danger, and she at once screamed out, and rolling herself on the ground, tried to put out the fire in that way. Lily, the younger of the twins, was the only one near enough to assist her mother, and rushing up, the little child had <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> pull off her wet bathing dress and wrap it round her mother's body, thus saving her from much worse injuries than those she received.
