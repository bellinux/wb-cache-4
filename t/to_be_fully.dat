5|$|Both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) {{and state}} {{wildlife}} {{agencies in the}} South contributed to the American alligator's recovery. Protection under the Endangered Species Act allowed the species to recuperate in many areas {{where it had been}} depleted. States began monitoring their American alligator populations to ensure that they would continue to grow. In 1987, the USFWS removed the animal from the endangered species list, as it was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fully</b> recovered. The USFWS still regulates the legal trade in American alligators and their products to protect still endangered crocodilians that may be passed off as American alligators during trafficking.|$|E
5|$|Christologically Maximus {{insisted on}} a strict dyophysitism, which {{can be seen as}} a {{corollary}} of the emphasis on theosis. In terms of salvation, humanity is intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fully</b> united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine.|$|E

The Palestine Electric Company inaugurated the Haifa Electrical Power Station already in 1925, opening the door to considerable industrialization.

5|$|Lithium {{reacts with}} water easily, but with noticeably less vigor than other alkali metals. The {{reaction}} forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution.

Though the heavier alkali metals {{can be stored in}} more dense substances, such as mineral oil, lithium is not dense enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fully</b> submerged in these liquids. In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of lithium hydroxide (LiOH and LiOH·H2O), lithium nitride (Li3N) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, the result of a secondary reaction between LiOH and CO2).|$|E

On 5 October 1962, central government troops again arrived in Bakwanga to support the mutineers and help suppress the last Kalonjist loyalists, marking {{the end of the}} secession.
