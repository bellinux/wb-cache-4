Motivated by recent experimental success in growing single-crystal metallic nanorods, we study quantum confinement effects on superconductivity in a cylindrical nanowire in the clean limit. For large diameters, where the <b>transverse</b> <b>level</b> spacing is smaller than superconducting order parameter, the usual approximations of Ginzburg-Landau theory are recovered.

However, most studies have measured the diameters of the spinal cord only, not {{the size of the}} subarachnoid space. The present study complements the current data on the morphology of the spinal contents, and in particular, the spinal subarachnoid space, by analyzing MRI images. Objective: To study morphology of the dural sac, spinal cord & subarachnoid space using MRI. To define the inner geometrical dimensions of spinal canal content that confine the maneuver of an endoscope inserted in cervical spine. 3. To have comprehensive knowledge of the anatomy of cervical spinal canal. Method: Based on MRI images of the spine from 60 normal patients of age between 25 - 60 years, the dimensions of spinal cord, dural sac & subarachnoid space were measured at mid-vertebral & intervertebral level from C 1 -C 7 vertebrae. The parameters measured were transverse, sagittal diameter of spinal cord & dural sac. The subarachnoid space was measured as anterior, posterior, right, left distance between spinal cord and dura mater. Results: It was found that at each selected <b>transverse</b> <b>level,</b> the subarachnoid space tends to be symmetrical on the right and left sides of the cord, and measures 3. 38 mm on an average.

The anterograde tracers Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin-L and biotinylated dextran amine were injected into the subiculum at different septotemporal and <b>transverse</b> <b>levels.</b> Deep layers of the ento-, peri-, and postrhinal cortices are the main recipients of subicular projections, but in all cases we noted that {{a small fraction of}} the projections also terminates in the superficial layers II and III. Analysis of the fiber patterns in the parahippocampal region revealed a topographic organization, depending on the location of the cells of origin along both the transverse and the septotemporal axes of the subiculum. Projections originating from subicular cells close to CA 1, i. e., proximal part of subiculum, terminate exclusively in the lateral entorhinal cortex and in the perirhinal cortex. In contrast, projections from cells closer to the subiculum-presubiculum border, i. e., distal part of subiculum, terminate in the medial entorhinal cortex and in the postrhinal cortex. In addition, cells in septal portions of the subiculum project to a lateral band of entorhinal cortex parallel to the rhinal sulcus and to peri- or postrhinal cortices, whereas cells in more temporal portions project to more medial parts of the entorhinal cortex. These results indicate that subicular projections to the parahippocampal region precisely reciprocate the known inputs from this region to the hippocampal formation. We thus suggest that the reciprocal connectivity between the subiculum and the parahippocampal region is organized as parallel pathways that serve to segregate information flow and thus maintain the identity of processed information. Although this parallel organization is comparable to that of the CA 1 -parahippocampal projections, differences exist with respect to the degree of collateralization. status: publishe...|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven sheep fetuses between 92 and 141 gestational days (term, 145 days) with and without tracheal occlusion (controls) underwent serial MR imaging and US. FLV at MR imaging was measured with true fast imaging with steady-state precession in coronal and transverse planes. The combined cross-sectional left- and right-lung area was measured with US at three <b>transverse</b> <b>levels.</b> FLV was measured at autopsy. Statistical evaluations included linear regression analysis and calculation of the mean and 95 % CI. RESULTS: No differences in FLV were observed on coronal or transverse MR images (r 2 = 0. 98; slope = 0. 91; 95 % CI: 0. 82, 1. 01). FLV at MR imaging at termination of the experiment {{was significantly related to}} FLV at autopsy (r 2 = 0. 96; slope = 1. 27; 95 % CI: 0. 97, 1. 57; n = 6). FLV at MR imaging increased more rapidly with gestational age in fetuses with tracheal occlusion (21. 0 mL/d; 95 % CI: 10. 7, 31. 3) than in controls (4. 7 mL/d; 95 % CI: 1. 7, 7. 7).

40|$|A counter-intuitive âselective weakeningâ (SW) seismic {{retrofit}} {{strategy for}} non-ductile RC frame is presented. By focusing on increasing the global displacement and ductility capacity, simple retrofit interventions such as selective {{weakening of the}} beams and external post-tensioning of the beam-column joints could change the local inelastic mechanism and result in improved global lateral and energy dissipation capacities. After {{an overview of the}} SW retrofit concept, this paper presents the experimental and numerical investigations of SW retrofit techniques for non-ductile RC exterior joints. The experimental results of nine 2 / 3 -scaled exterior joint subassembliesâ as-built and SW retrofitted tests are briefly presented. Parameters considered in the tests included the presence of column lap-splice, slab and <b>transverse</b> beams, <b>level</b> of post-tensioning forces and location of beam weakening. Numerical investigation using 3 D micro-plane concrete model within smeared fracture mechanics finite-element modelling is demonstrated for SW retrofitted joints. Lastly, a preliminary design procedure is outlined for the design of SW retrofit for exterior beam-column joints. With its economical, non-invasive and low-technology intensity approach, SW retrofit has potential for a wide implementation...|$|R
40|$|Observations of the X-ray pulsar Hercules X- 1 show a line {{emission}} feature {{at about}} 60 keV, {{which has been}} interpreted as the fundamental electron cyclotron line in a magnetic field of around six trillion gauss. In this interpretation, the line radiation results from transitions between <b>transverse</b> energy <b>levels,</b> which are quantized by the field. The expected line luminosity from the excitation of these levels by protons which are falling into the polar cap of a neutron star are calculated. They are assumed to attain kinetic energies up to around 200 MeV, the gravitational potential energy at the surface. The cross sections for high energy Coulomb encounters between small pitch angle protons and electrons in a strong field are measured and {{used to calculate the}} energy loss rate of the infalling protons. This rate, together with the rate of elastic nuclear proton collisions, is then used to calculate the number of line photons an infalling proton can be expected to produce, directly or indirectly. The results are applied to Hercules X- 1...|$|R
