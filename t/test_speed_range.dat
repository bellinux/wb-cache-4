The results of the investigation were compared with those of a similar investigation for a tandem two-duct arrangement in which the ducts were fixed (rather than tiltable) relative to the airframe, since the three-duct configuration had been devised in an attempt to avoid some of the deficiencies of the tandem fixed-duct configuration. The results of the investigation indicated that the tilting-duct arrangement had less noseup pitching moment for a given forward speed than the tandem fixed-duct arrangement.

Film thickness, seal seat axial motion, seal frictional torque, and film axial load were recorded as functions of time. The experiments revealed that for sinusoidal axial oscillations of the seal seat, the primary ring followed the seal seat motion very well. For a skewed seal seat, however, the primary ring did not follow the seal seat motion, and load-carrying capacity was degraded.

The fracture energies were higher at high test speeds than could be expected based on the low speeds results. This effect was due to an increased fracture stress, initiation strain, and propagation strain. With infrared measurements a temperature increase of 30 – 40 °C was observed. Also the size of the deformation zone increased with test speed. A possible explanation is a thermal blunting resulting from adiabatic heating at high speeds.

The inward-pumping spiral-groove seals exhibited a high-amplitude film thickness vibratory mode with a frequency of four times the shaft speed. This mode was not observed in the other seals tested.

40|$|Theory {{indicates}} that compliant materials {{are able to}} reduce the frictional drag of a marine body by delaying the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Recent experimentation on relatively small samples of compliant material suggest that correctly designed compliant materials are able to damp instabilities in the boundary layer and delay transition. In this research the challenge was to design a device {{that could be used}} to test relatively large panels of complaint material and subsequently use the device to make an experimental comparison between the drag of complaint material and a standard non-compliant surface. In particular, the principal requirement of the test device was that laminar flow persisted over the leading edge and was incident on the compliant material surface over the desired <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range.</b> A drag-plate with a laminar flow nose section was designed for this purpose. In the first part of this thesis basic drag assessments are made using engineering formulae followed by a rigorous computational assessment of fluid flow, boundary layer properties and transition prediction for alternative laminar flow drag-plates. An optimum geometry is established for the laminar flow nose and other practical design requirements are assessed, resulting in the final design of the laminar flow drag-plate. In addition a suitable dynamometer with associated fixtures is designed. In the second part of this thesis, the experimental facility is characterised and experimental procedures established. The drag of a compliant material is compared to a standard non-compliant material. No drag reduction was evident, although the compliant material (supplied from an external source) had inconsistencies in manufacture. A number of different demonstrations of the laminar flow performance of the drag-plate are presented. These include a novel practical transition detection method and flow visualisation. It is demonstrated that the design challenge of producing a laminar flow device has been achieved despite the fact that the drag-plate exhibits a degree of roughening over the experimental period.

40|$|The {{primary concern}} {{associated}} with a two-stroke engine performance is its gas exchange process (scavenging process). The success of the scavenging process greatly affects the thermodynamic properties of cylinder content at the trapping conditions and hence the combustion and power output. The unsteady gas flow in engine pipes has a marked influence on the scavenging process. In the current study, the two-stroke engine simulation model has been developed to predict the steady state performance characteristics of a crankcase compressed, piston port-timed, two-stroke engine equipped with expansion chamber. The characteristics include parameters such as engine torque and power, BSFC, scavenging efficiency and charging efficiency. The model also {{has the ability to}} predict the unsteady gas dynamic behaviour in various engine pipes. The instantaneous pressure fluctuation and mass flow rates at inlet port, transfer port and exhaust port were calculated and analysed. The model has several advantages compared with other one-dimensional isentropic model. It includes an improved procedure to account for the variation in geometry of pipe and to determine the thermodynamic states in cylinder/crankcase. The model also considered the temperature discontinuity at port/pipe interface. All these efforts increase the accuracy and numerical stability of the prediction. A single cylinder two-stroke engine dynamometer rig and dedicated fast data acquisition hardware and software have been developed in the project. Engine torque, speed and fuel consumption can be measured on the dynamometer rig. The dynamic pressure signals in engine cylinder, transfer port and exhaust port, together with crankshaft position signal, can be acquired at a speed of 50, 000 sample/second per channel, sufficient for accurate acquisition of experimental data. Substantial simulations and experiments were performed and the computer model was validated. A variable exhaust system, as described in this study, was used to improve a twostroke engine's performance under off-design engine speeds. This was realised by making the mid-parallel section of a conventional expansion chamber extendable, while the other dimensions of that chamber remained unchanged. In the study it was found that with the adjustable expansion chamber, the pressure wave timing at the exhaust port was under control within the <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range</b> (2200 - 4400 RPM) so that such wave timing matched the engine port timing, leading to a relative optimum in performance. The numerical approach proposed could satisfactorily handle the complicated pipe flow calculation and predict both engine performance and dynamic wave variations in the test engine. Thus the program can be used for improving the design and development of naturally aspired, port-controlled crankcase compressed two-stroke engines...|$|E
40|$|Gas foil {{bearings}} (GFB) {{appear to}} satisfy most requirements for oil-free turbomachinery, i. e. relatively simple in construction, ensuring low drag friction and reliable high speed operation. However, GFBs {{have a limited}} load capacity and minimal amounts of damping. A test rig for the rotordynamic evaluation of gas foil bearings was constructed. A DC router motor, 25 krpm max speed, drives a 1. 02 kg hollow rotor supported on two bump-type foil gas bearings (L = D = 38. 10 mm). Measurements of the test rotor dynamic response were conducted for increasing mass imbalance conditions. Typical waterfalls of rotor coast down response from 25 krpm to rest evidence the onset and disappearance of severe subsynchronous motions with whirl frequencies at ~ 50 % of rotor speed, roughly coinciding with the (rigid mode) natural frequencies of the rotor-bearing system. The amplitudes of motion, synchronous and subsynchronous, increase (non) linearly {{with respect to the}} imbalance displacements. The rotor motions are rather large; yet, the foil bearings, by virtue of their inherent flexibility, prevented the catastrophic failure of the test rotor. Tests at the top shaft speed, 25 krpm, did not excite subsynchronous motions. In the experiments, the subsynchronous motion speed range is well confined to shaft speeds ranging from 22 krpm to 12 krpm. The experimental results show the severity of subsynchronous motions is related to the amount of imbalance in the rotor. Surprisingly enough, external air pressurization {{on one side of the}} foil bearings acted to reduce the amplitudes of motion while the rotor crossed its critical speeds. An air-film hovering effect may have enhanced the sliding of the bumps thus increasing the bearings?? damping action. The tests also demonstrate that increasing the gas feed pressure ameliorates the amplitudes of subsynchronous motions due to the axial flow retarding the circumferential flow velocity development. A finite element rotordynamic analysis models the test rotor and uses predicted bearing force coefficients from the static equilibrium GFB load analysis. The rotordynamic analysis predicts critical speeds at ~ 8 krpm and ~ 9 krpm, which correlate well with test critical speeds. Predictions of rotordynamic stability are calculated for the <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range</b> (0 to 25 krpm), showing unstable operation for the rotor/bearing system starting at 12 krpm and higher. Predictions and experimental results show good agreement in terms of critical speed correlation, and moderate displacement amplitude discrepancies for some imbalance conditions. Post-test inspection of the rotor evidenced sustained wear at the locations in contact with the bearings' axial edges. However, the foil bearings are almost in pristine condition; except for top foil coating wear at the bearing edges and along the direction of applied static load...|$|E

40|$|A {{prototype}} of a versatile, observer-based magnetic bearing controller for aerospace flywheels was successfully developed and demonstrated on a magnetic bearing test rig (see the photograph) and an actual flywheel module. The {{objective of this}} development included a fast, yet low risk, control development process, and a robust, high-performance controller for a large variety of flywheels. This required a good system model, an efficient development procedure, and a model-based controller that addressed the key problems associated with flywheel and bearing imbalance, sensor error, and vibration. The model used in this control development and tuning procedure included the flexible rotor dynamics and motor-induced vibrations. Such a model was essential for low-risk scheduling of speed-dependent control parameters and for reliable evaluation of novel control strategies. The successfully tested control prototype utilized an extended Kalman filter to estimate the true rotor principal-axis motion from the raw sensor position feedback. For control refinement, the extended Kalman filter also estimated and eliminated the combined effects of mass-imbalance and sensor runouts from the input data. A key advantage of the design based on the extended Kalman filter {{is its ability to}} accurately estimate both the rotor's principal-axis position and gyroscopic rates with the least amount of phase lag. This is important for control parameter scheduling to dampen the gyroscopic motions. Because of large uncertainties in the magnetic bearing and imbalance characteristics, this state-estimation scheme alone is insufficient for containing the rotor motion within the desired 1 -mil excursion radius. A nonlinear gain adjustment based on an estimation of the principal-axis orbit size was needed to provide a coarse (nonoptimal), but robust, control of the orbit growth. Control current minimization was achieved with a (steepest gradient) search of synchronous errors in the principal-axis position input data. Actual flywheel tests of this observer-based controller (developed entirely in-house) at the NASA Glenn Research Center showed that the model correctly predicted the rotor orbit growth as a function of rotational speed, and it demonstrated the capability of gain adjustments to arrest this growth. Data from these tests on an actual flywheel module spun to 26, 000 rpm proved that the controller was able to contain the shaft motion to within much less than 0. 5 mils of radial excursion with axis currents less than 300 mA in root-mean-square estimate. The <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range</b> was limited because of thermal expansion concerns for this particular flywheel unit, not because of any deficiency in the controller. Simulations for this unit indicated that the controller should be robust up to its top operating speed of 60, 000 rpm. Aside from these important achievements, and most significantly, it took less than 1 week to adapt this controller from the simple test rig to the actual flywheel and to demonstrate full five-axis levitation and control. This demonstration showed that both the controller and the model-based development and tuning framework are easily adaptable {{to a wide range of}} rotors and bearing configurations and, hence, are capable of reducing design risks and costs for many future flywheel technology developments...|$|E
40|$|Micro {{embossing}} is {{the process}} of fabricating micron-sized features by plastic deformation of a work piece by means of a shaped tool or die. In our work we are concerned with hot embossing of PMMA to produce features in the 1 - 100 µm range, suited for micro fluidic and photonic product requirements. As with any deformation process, hot micro embossing yields products with dimensional variation. In ideal situations, several products can be manufactured repeatedly with the same machine settings and be expected to be exactly the same in every aspect with each other. In reality, final products from the same process might have variations in dimensions and material properties even if the machine settings are kept constant. These can be natural variations of the process or variations caused by external disturbances. Variations can decrease the yield of a manufacturing process and can also restrict the ultimate level of product precision attainable. Manufacturing process control entails the study of the origins of process variations and the use of this knowledge to reduce this variation under production conditions. Manufacturing process control is thus vital in establishing the ultimate cost, quality, rate and flexibility of any manufacturing process. Thus, we are interested in controlling inputs that have a direct effect on the work piece’s final shape and thus the productivity. For hot embossing of PMMA, we are interested in controlling: (1) the temperature of the die and work piece during the entire forming process (forming & cooling), (2) the rate of cooling of the die and substrate, (3) die and substrate platen displacement and displacement rate, (4) force applied on the platen and distribution of this force. The temperature needs to be controlled as it affects the thermo-mechanical behavior of the PMMA. The forming temperature determines the forming properties of the material, the rate of cooling will affect the amount of shrinkage and thermal stresses that the polymer work piece undergoes. The displacement will affect the flow of the material into the die and this will affect the feature size and depths to be embossed. The displacement rate will affect the non-Newtonian polymeric material flow rate into the cavity. It is imperative to carefully control those inputs to minimize variations in forming behavior and final product dimension and properties. An experimental lab scale micro embossing machine to address the needs was designed and fabricated at the Manufacturing Process Control Lab (MPCL) at MIT. An Instron Model 5869 Table mounted materials testing system of capacity 50 KN (11250 lb) was chosen as the platform for the apparatus and it was modified to accept the forming platens with temperature controllers which have capability of controlling the temperatures of the substrate and master to +/- 1 degree Celsius accuracy. The controller powers 2 x 200 watt heaters that can heat the platens to 150 Celsius in 8 minutes. The Instron has a <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range</b> of 1 micron to 500 mm/min (0. 00004 in/min to 20 in/min) with a 50 KN load cell attached to the platen with an accuracy of +/- 1 N. The platen cooling system uses water where flow rate will vary the resulting cooling rate. To ensure even heating of the substrate, shape factor analysis was used {{in the design of the}} copper platens. The shape factor analysis reveals the heat flow patterns and regions of isotherm within the platens originating from the cartridge heaters and thus using this information, the platens can be designed to have the cartridge heaters located so as to minimize temperature variation of the surface of the platen. The apparatus has been used so far to study hot embossing of sub-millimeter sized features using a copper master on a 1 mm thick PMMA material. This presentation will provide greater details on the design of the machine, its initial performance tests and some preliminary process variation experiments. Singapore-MIT Alliance (SMA...|$|E

Tension, shear and peel joint specimens have been <b>tested</b> over the <b>speed</b> <b>range</b> from low rate (10 − 3 m/s) to high rate (5 m/s), using a high rate servo-hydraulic machine. A heat treatment was applied {{to some of the}} material and joint specimens to simulate the paint bake conditioning applied to a car body in industry. The aluminium sheet material used to form the substrates was tested over the strain rate range from quasi-static (10 − 3 s− 1) to near 500 s− 1, and strain rate dependency on strength was not observed. Although the sheet material tested showed no strain rate dependency, this paper reports a measurable reduction in performance for the tension and shear joint test results at higher rate, which has not been previously reported. Common to all joint types tested in this paper is interlock failure and this is a tension failure mode. A rate dependent empirical model which relates energy to the negative exponential of <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> is shown to be a good fit to the joint tension test results. The same model holds for the relationship between maximum displacement and <b>test</b> <b>speed.</b> After calibration, the model shows a transition in which performance decreases rapidly at higher rate for the joint interlock failure mode. An explanation of the cause is discussed. Critical to the findings reported in this paper is the design of the fixture and force transducer to test U shaped tension specimens over the <b>speed</b> <b>range</b> of interest. A finite element model of the fixture and test measurement system was developed to ensure a near optimal design. Sufficient details of these are given to reproduce the test results...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{description of}} the working principles and evaluation of the operational parameters of the commercially available fuel conversion adapter, intended to adapt gasoline fuelled spark ignition (SI) engine for use of high ethanol content blended fuel, known as E 85. Commercially available gasoline and E 85 fuel were used as test fuels. Production automobile, equipped with 1. 8 litre 4 cylinder SI port fuel injection (PFI) engine was tested on the roll-type eddy-current chassis dynamometer in wide open throttle (WOT) constant speed mode. High precision fuel consumption measurement system AVL KMA Mobile was used. Engine operating parameters, used for evaluation of {{the efficiency of the}} fuel conversion adapter was engine torque (T), engine brake power (Pb), air/fuel equivalence ratio (λ), specific fuel consumption (SFC) and engine thermal efficiency (ηt). Analysis of engine operational parameters showed successful operation of fuel conversion adapter with E 85 fuel, resulting in increase of engine peak torque by 4. 4 %, increase of energy efficiency in whole <b>tested</b> engine <b>speed</b> <b>range</b> up to 6. 1 % but increase of specific fuel consumption by approximately 22 %, when compared with the gasoline use...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} experiments {{aimed at}} demonstrating {{the effectiveness of}} Pulsed Vortex Generator Jets in controlling separation on aircraft wings. The demonstration is accomplished by applying the jets to two relevant configurations and evaluating their effectiveness in a wind tunnel. The jet design and placement for both experiments was based on parametric studies described in a previous paper. In the first application, pulsed jets prevented separation over the wings on a three-dimensional lambda-wing fighter configuration at low speeds and high angles of attack. This experiment shows that the flow control method can enhance the lift, and hence the maneuverability, of advanced fighters in post-stall flight. The lambda-wing experiments also demonstrated that jets can be operated asymmetrically for lateral maneuvering control at high angles of attack. The second set of experiments <b>tested</b> higher <b>speed</b> <b>ranges,</b> applying jets to an airfoil section in a M = 0. 3 - 0. 5 flow. This configuration is relevant to subsonic cruise. The results show that Pulsed Vortex Generator Jets can increase lift and L/D, but they were less effective at supercritical speeds where separation is induced by hinge line shocks. In all cases, the jets increased lift over their effective range, while their drag effect was small...|$|R
40|$|This study {{concerns}} applying {{parallel programming}} to reservoir simulation using a 32 -Mbyte, 12 -processor parallel computer. The effects of number of processes, granularity, load balancing and program structure were studied. The model simulated was a two-dimensionals, two-phase, black oil {{model with a}} fully-implicit formulation. The differenced equations were solved by the Newton-Raphson method and, Gaussian elimination was used to solve the Jacobian matrix. Matrix generation was parallelized using monitors as macros to synchronize calculation. The performance of the simulator {{was measured by the}} speed up. The speed ups of the matrix generation time increased almost linearly with increasing number of processes. For all of the models <b>tested,</b> the <b>speed</b> ups <b>ranged</b> from 3. 5 to 4. 0 for four processes and 7. 0 to 7. 9 for eight proceses...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} whether delta-V can be modified with a measure of vehicle structure performance and occupant restraint performance to better predict occupant peak chest acceleration during a frontal crash. A total of 619 full-scale frontal crash <b>tests,</b> with impact <b>speeds</b> <b>ranging</b> from 14 to 42 mph, were analyzed. Multiple linear regression was used to correlate combinations of crash severity, vehicle structure performance, and occupant restraint performance descriptors to the maximum measured crash test dummy chest acceleration. Using an adjusted R 2 selection method, the best combination of metrics were selected and then compared to a baseline model that used only delta-V to predict occupant chest kinematics. The combination of delta-V, ridedown efficiency, and the kinetic energy factor was found to provide the best prediction of the occupant chest acceleration. This combination accounted for approximately 4 times the variation in the maximum chest acceleration when compared to a model based solely on vehicle delta-V...|$|R
40|$|Current {{combustion}} engines provide excellent performance for vehicle propulsion and power generation. However, recent demands from society ask for higher efficiencies and lower emissions. These requirements {{are hard to}} meet with current technology and call for new solutions. Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition, HCCI, offers a potential to combine high efficiency with very low emissions. It operates with high compression ratio and without throttling, thus avoiding some sources of efficiency penalties of the spark ignited engine. Due to the usage of compression ignition, premixed and very lean, or diluted, mixtures can be used. Highly diluted mixtures keep the combustion temperature low and minimize production of Oxides of Nitrogen, NOX. On the other hand, the diluted operation causes lower power density as well as higher emissions of Unburned Hydrocarbons, HC. The HC can be oxidized in a catalyst, but lower the combustion efficiency and thus also the brake thermal efficiency. Compression ignition of a premixed charge is also very challenging from a controls perspective: {{there is no direct}} means of controlling the onset of combustion. The results presented in this thesis are mainly based on experiments. These are performed on two different truck size Diesel engines and one passenger-car size engine, converted to HCCI. For the diesel engines the displacement volume is between 1. 5 and 2 l/cylinder and the <b>speed</b> <b>ranges</b> from 1000 to 2000 rpm. Double fuel systems are used, providing one fuel that is easy to ignite and one fuel more reluctant to auto ignition. By adjusting the ratio between the two fuels, the onset of combustion is controlled. The fuels used are n-heptane, isooctane, ethanol, gasoline, natural gas and hydrogen; in all cases port injected. For the passenger-car size engine the displacement is only 0. 3 l/cylinder and the <b>tested</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range</b> is 1000 to 5000 rpm. This engine uses fully blended gasoline RON 92 and is controlled either by its variable compression ratio or by the mixing valves for heated and cool air. The thesis discusses operating domain, efficiency, emissions and control of HCCI engines. The HCCI process is compared to the existing processes for Spark Ignited, SI, engines and Direct Injected Compression Ignition, DICI, engines. It is shown that the HCCI process is somewhat closer to the ideal Otto cycle, compared to the other processes. The influences on efficiency of heat losses, friction, boost, compression ratio and combustion are discussed in comparison to SI and DICI engines. Emissions of NOX, HC and CO are also discussed. Different methods for characterizing and controlling the HCCI combustion are outlined and demonstrated. The fundamental aspects of controlling the HCCI combustion are outlined and discussed. The real-time requirements are reviewed with respect to a controller implementation in a PC. Process characteristics are identified and compared for different operating points. Qualitative characterization as well as state of the art System Identification are applied. Two strategies of controller design are discussed and compared. Both the manually tuned PID controller and the more systematic method of LQG controller design are shown to give acceptable controller performance...|$|R
40|$|The present {{interest}} in micro air vehicles {{has given the}} research on bat flight a new impulse. With the use of high speed cameras and improved PIV techniques, the kinematics and aerodynamics of bats have been studied in great detail. A robotic flapper {{makes it possible to}} do measurements by systematically changing only one parameter at a time and investigate the parameter space outside the natural flight envelope of bats without risking animal safety. For this study, a robotic flapper (RoBat), inspired by Leptonycteris yerbabuenae was developed and <b>tested</b> over the <b>speed</b> <b>range</b> 1 - 7 m/s, with variable maximum angles of attacks (AoA(max) = 55 degrees and 15 degrees, respectively) and constant AoA(max). = 55 degrees. These measurements show the presence of a leading edge vortex (LEV) for low speeds and a fully attached flow for high speeds at low AoA(max), which is in line with natural bat flight. A LEV occurs for AoA(max) = 55 degrees throughout the complete flight <b>speed</b> <b>range,</b> and throughout which the LEV circulation coefficient remains rather constant. This implies that bats and micro air vehicles could use LEVs for high load maneuvers also at relatively high flight speeds. However, at high flight speeds the LEV bursts, which causes increased drag, most likely due to a decrease in Strouhal number. (C) 2011 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.
