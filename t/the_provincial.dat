5|$|The câmara {{municipal}} (town council) was {{the governing}} body in {{towns and cities}} and had existed in Brazil {{since the beginning of}} the colonial period in the 16th century. The Chamber was composed of vereadores (councilmen), the number of which depended on the size of the town. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>Provincial</b> General Council, the Constitution gave town councils great autonomy. However, when <b>the</b> <b>Provincial</b> Assembly replaced <b>the</b> <b>Provincial</b> General Council in 1834, many of the powers of town councils (including the setting of municipal budgets, oversight of expenditures, creation of jobs, and the nomination of civil servants) were transferred to <b>the</b> <b>provincial</b> government. Additionally, any laws enacted by the town council had to be ratified by <b>the</b> <b>Provincial</b> Assembly—but not by Parliament. While the 1834 Additional Act granted greater autonomy to the provinces from the central government, it transferred the towns' remaining autonomy to <b>the</b> <b>provincial</b> governments. There was no office of mayor, and towns were governed by a town council and its president (who was the councilman who won the most votes during elections).|$|E
