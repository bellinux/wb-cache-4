5|$|Of {{the many}} {{decisions}} made by Captain Boutelle in managing the park, his approach to fisheries had significant and lasting impact. Boutelle was an avid angler and recognized <b>the</b> <b>angling</b> potential in Yellowstone waters. In 1889 he suggested the U.S. Fish Commission consider stocking many of the fish-less lakes and streams in Yellowstone.|$|E
5|$|This {{suggestion}} was acted upon and in 1889 the first non-native fish were stocked into Yellowstone waters, {{a practice that}} continued until 1955 and helped create <b>the</b> <b>angling</b> experience Yellowstone National Park is renowned for.|$|E
25|$|He {{has written}} three books, all with {{conservation}} themes: Wild Tales from the Wild, {{about the people}} and wildlife of the Mangala valley in Karnataka; Subhan and I: My Adventure with <b>the</b> <b>Angling</b> Legend of India, about angling for mahseer in the Cauvery River; and a novel, Matabele Dawn, a thriller set in Africa and India.|$|E
2500|$|In {{hyperbolic}} geometry, <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of parallelism [...] , is <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> at one vertex {{of a right}} hyperbolic triangle {{that has}} two asymptotic parallel sides. <b>The</b> <b>angle</b> depends on <b>the</b> segment length a between <b>the</b> right <b>angle</b> and <b>the</b> vertex of <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of parallelism.|$|R
5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> ∠ (h, k) is {{congruent}} to <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> ∠ (h′, k′) and to <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> ∠ (h″, k″), then <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> ∠ (h′, k′) is congruent to <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> ∠ (h″, k″); {{that is to}} say, if ∠ (h, k) &cong; ∠ (h′, k′) and ∠ (h, k) &cong; ∠ (h″, k″), then ∠ (h′, k′) &cong; ∠ (h″, k″).|$|R
50|$|In geometry, symmedians {{are three}} {{particular}} geometrical lines associated with every triangle. They are constructed {{by taking a}} median of the triangle (a line connecting a vertex with {{the midpoint of the}} opposite side), and reflecting the line over <b>the</b> corresponding <b>angle</b> bisector (<b>the</b> line through the same vertex that divides <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> there in half). <b>The</b> <b>angle</b> formed by <b>the</b> symmedian and <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> bisector has <b>the</b> same measure as <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> between <b>the</b> median and <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> bisector, but it {{is on the other side}} of <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> bisector.|$|R
25|$|Parks and amenity spaces include Fitzgerald's Park to {{the west}} of the city (which {{contains}} the Cork Public Museum), <b>the</b> <b>angling</b> lake known as The Lough, Bishop Lucey Park (which is centrally located and contains a portion of the old city wall) and the Marina and Atlantic Pond (an avenue and amenity near Blackrock used by joggers, runners and rowing clubs).|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the 1925 World Series the right field {{pavilion}} had also been double-decked, and <b>the</b> <b>angling</b> right field wall and its scoreboard were reconstructed to align with the low right field wall, about 8 feet inside of it. This also resulted in the unique inward-pointing 90° angle in center field. Both versions of the tall fence had the effect of keeping the neighbors in the adjacent row houses from watching the games for free.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, {{negotiations}} with <b>the</b> <b>angling</b> associations owning fishing rights on the Dee broke down. The anglers wanted {{to restrict the}} numbers of paddlers on the river when paddling was allowed but the Welsh Canoe Association wanted to renew the previous agreement. In November 2004, a protest {{about the lack of}} access on the Dee, and to rivers across England and Wales, was held in Llangollen. Following the failure of the access agreement, the Welsh Canoeing Association advises canoeists to use their own judgement about using the river, which in practice means many canoeists use the river at will from the numerous access points along its banks.|$|E
50|$|The law of {{reflection}} describes <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of reflected light: <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of incident light {{is the same}} as <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of <b>the</b> reflected light.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>angle</b> {{we seek to}} {{maximize}} is &beta; &minus; &alpha;. The tangent of <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> increases as <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> increases; therefore it suffices {{to maximize}} ...|$|R
50|$|A {{plane mirror}} is a mirror {{with a flat}} (planar) {{reflective}} surface. For light rays striking a plane mirror, <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of reflection equals <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of incidence. <b>The</b> <b>angle</b> of incidence is <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> between <b>the</b> incident ray and the surface normal (an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface). Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of reflection is <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> between <b>the</b> reflected ray and the normal and a collimated beam of light does not spread out after reflection from a plane mirror, except for diffraction effects.|$|R
25|$|The {{species was}} accidentally {{introduced}} into the North American Great Lakes by way of ballast water transfer in cargo ships. First discovered in North America in the St. Clair River in 1990, the round goby is considered an invasive species with significant ecological and economic impact; the consequences are quite complex as the fish both competes with native species and provides an abundant source of food for them while consuming other invasive species. In other words, the round goby behaves much like most biological invasive controls. An aggressive fish, the round goby outcompetes native species such as the sculpin and logperch for food (such as snails and mussels), shelter and nesting sites, substantially reducing their numbers. Round gobies are also voracious predators of eggs of native fish, many important to <b>the</b> <b>angling</b> industry. The goby's robust ability to survive in degraded environmental conditions has helped to increase its competitive advantage compared to native species. Many native predatory fish such as smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, walleye, salmon and trout have begun to prey on round gobies. The incorporation of the round goby into native foodwebs, coupled with the goby's ability to consume large numbers of invasive mussels (zebra and quagga), may result in greater bioaccumulation of toxins such as PCBs higher in the food chain, since these mussels filter-feed and are known to accumulate persistent contaminants. However, this is partly beneficial because {{even though they do}} not reduce the population of zebra mussels, they do control their population. Hence, it prevents a large scale spread of the zebra mussel, which is also an invasive species in the Great Lakes.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, angler Bob Nudd {{received}} the most votes following a campaign in <b>the</b> <b>Angling</b> Times. However, the BBC deemed this to be against the rules and [...] "discarded all the ballots cast on forms printed in <b>the</b> <b>Angling</b> Times", allowing athlete Liz McColgan to win the award. The following year racing driver Nigel Mansell became the second person to win the main award twice, having won his first in 1986. Sue Barker presented the show {{for the first time}} in 1994, at which racing driver Damon Hill won the first of his two awards, the second coming two years later. Boxer Frank Bruno was the inaugural winner of the Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996, and as of 2014 there have been 15 recipients of the award.|$|E
2500|$|Ray Bergman, <b>the</b> <b>angling</b> {{editor of}} Outdoor Life magazine, {{was a fan}} of the Firehole River and gave it many pages of {{coverage}} in his work Trout (1938, 1952).

5000|$|According {{to vector}} mathematics, <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of <b>the</b> {{result of the}} {{rational}} polynomial {{is the sum of}} all <b>the</b> <b>angles</b> in <b>the</b> numerator minus the sum of all <b>the</b> <b>angles</b> in <b>the</b> denominator. So to test whether a point in the s-plane is on the root locus, only <b>the</b> <b>angles</b> to all <b>the</b> open loop poles and zeros need be considered. This is known as <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> condition.|$|R

2500|$|Gardiner, Montana, {{although}} not the size or draw of West Yellowstone, got its own local fly fishing shop in 1953 when Merton J. Parks opened Parks' Fly Shop.

60|$|It is {{a simple}} and easily worked plan, {{and there has been}} some talk lately of its being made use of by <b>the</b> <b>angling</b> {{fraternity}} in general. Indeed, the Committee of the Thames Angler’s Association did recommend its adoption about two years ago, but some of the older members opposed it. They said they would consider the idea if the number were doubled, and each fish counted as twenty.|$|E
50|$|To use the {{tomahawk}} to trisect an angle, it {{is placed}} with its handle line touching {{the apex of}} <b>the</b> <b>angle,</b> with <b>the</b> blade inside <b>the</b> <b>angle,</b> tangent {{to one of the}} two rays forming <b>the</b> <b>angle,</b> and with <b>the</b> spike touching the other ray of <b>the</b> <b>angle.</b> One of <b>the</b> two trisecting lines then lies on the handle segment, and the other passes through the center point of the semicircle. If <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> to be trisected is too sharp relative to the length of the tomahawk's handle, it may not be possible to fit the tomahawk into <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> in this way, but this difficulty may be worked around by repeatedly doubling <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> until it is large enough for the tomahawk to trisect it, and then repeatedly bisecting <b>the</b> trisected <b>angle</b> <b>the</b> same number of times as <b>the</b> original <b>angle</b> was doubled.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of view from <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of coverage, which describes <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> range that a lens can image. Typically the image circle produced by a lens {{is large enough to}} cover the film or sensor completely, possibly including some vignetting toward the edge. If <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of coverage of the lens does not fill the sensor, the image circle will be visible, typically with strong vignetting toward the edge, and <b>the</b> effective <b>angle</b> of view will be limited to <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of coverage.|$|R

6000|$|... {7} I have {{examined}} all <b>the</b> <b>Angling</b> {{works of the}} period known to me. Gilbert's Angler's Delight (1676) is a mere pamphlet; William Gilbert, gent., pilfers from Walton, without naming him, and has literally nothing original or meritorious. The book is very scarce. My own copy is 'uncut,' but incomplete, lacking the directions for fishing 'in Hackney River.' Gervase Markham, prior to Walton, is a compiler rather than an original authority on angling.|$|E

60|$|IT is {{said that}} many an unlucky urchin is induced {{to run away from}} his family and betake himself to a {{seafaring}} life from reading the history of Robinson Crusoe; and I suspect that, in like manner, many of those worthy gentlemen who are given to haunt the sides of pastoral streams with angle-rods in hand may trace the origin of their passion to the seductive pages of honest Izaak Walton. I recollect studying his Complete Angler several years since in company with a knot of friends in America, and moreover that we were all completely bitten with <b>the</b> <b>angling</b> mania. It was early in the year, {{but as soon as the}} weather was auspicious, and that the spring began to melt into the verge of summer, we took rod in hand and sallied into the country, as stark mad as was ever Don Quixote from reading books of chivalry.|$|E
50|$|The normal is {{the line}} {{perpendicular}} {{to the surface of}} an optical medium at a given point.
