5|$|Messiaen used modes {{he called}} modes of limited transposition. They are {{distinguished}} as groups of notes {{that can only}} be transposed by a semitone a limited number of times. For example, the whole-tone scale (Messiaen's Mode 1) only exists in two transpositions: namely C–D–E–F–G–A and D–E–F–G–A–B. Messiaen abstracted these modes from the harmony of his improvisations and early works.

Another example concerns the discrepancy among “old” and “new” genres.

5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry.

40|$|In {{producing}} {{transport services}} several different transport modes are available. Through the last decades, road transport has increased rapidly. This development is recognised as unsustainable. A more sustainable alternative is intermodal transport. Less-than-truckload (LTL) networks, i. e. networks designed to transport consignments not filling a truck, are historically based on road transport. Intermodal transport {{is an alternative}} on some routes in the LTL networks. A transport mode choice is at hand on these routes. The purpose of this thesis is {{to contribute to the}} understanding of how <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> choice between intermodal transport and road transport is made in LTL networks. Previous studies of <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> choice have identified factors that are important but also emphasise the complex nature of <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> choice. However, including the context in which <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> choice is made can provide a better understanding of <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> choice complexity. Time pressure is high in LTL networks. Five aspects of time that are important in <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> choice in <b>the</b> studied LTL network are identified. These can be used to broadly measure the compliance of IRRT to consolidated cargo, a LTL service. Addressing the complexity of <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> choice, <b>the</b> decision-making that includes <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> choice is structured by applying theoretical perspectives of decision-making and company operations. A general and descriptive model is the result. This structure is a tool to explain how the decision-making that includes <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> choice is constituted. In LTL networks forwarders often contract hauliers to perform the transport services. This entails <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> choice being distributed to the hauliers. Forwarders, the controlling actors of LTL networks, thus have limited influence over <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> choice. Applying <b>the</b> quasifirm organisational perspective to the organisation of LTL networks provides some explanatory concepts showing {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} this organisation structure when it concerns <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> choice. Consequently, <b>the</b> thesis shows some different aspects of <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> choice in LTL networks by both empirical investigation and theoretical application...|$|R

5|$|Latin American {{novels that}} explore {{political}} themes, but {{that do not}} centre upon the rule of a particular dictator, are informally classified as “not quite dictator novels”. For example, Libro de Manuel (A Manual for Manuel, 1973), by Julio Cortázar, is a postmodern novel about urban guerrillas and their revolutionary struggle, which asks the reader to examine the broader societal matters of language, sexuality, and <b>the</b> <b>modes</b> of interpretation. In the Time of the Butterflies (1994), by Julia Álvarez, {{tells the story of}} the Mirabal sisters, whom patriotism transformed from well-behaved Catholic débutantes to political dissenters against the thirty-year dictatorship of the Trujillo régime in the Dominican Republic. The novel sought to illuminate the officially-obscured-history of the deaths of the Mirabal sisters, not to determine what happened to them, but to determine how the Mirabal sisters happened to the national politics of the Dominican Republic. In the mock-diary “Intimate Diary of Solitude” (third part of El imperio de los sueños 1988; Empire of Dreams, 1994), by Giannina Braschi, the protagonist is Mariquita Samper, the diarist who shoots the narrator of the Latin American Boom in revolt against his dictatorial control of the fictional narration. Moreover, in Braschi’s most recent work “United States of Banana” (2011), the Puerto Rican prisoner Segismundo overthrows his father, the King of the United States of Banana, who had imprisoned him for more than a hundred years in the dungeon of the Statue of Liberty, for the crime of having been born. The story of Distant Star (1996), by Roberto Bolaño, begins on 11 September 1973, with the coup d’état by General Augusto Pinochet against Salvador Allende, the President of Chile. The writer and professor of literature Raymond Leslie Williams describes the aforementioned novels as not-quite-dictator-novels, which are reminiscent of the genre for being “acutely and subtly political fiction” that addresses themes different from those of the dictator novel, which cannot be divorced from the politics of the stories, and so each “can be read as a meditation on the horror of absolute power”.|$|E
