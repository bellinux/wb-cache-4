5000|$|Wanting to be {{involved}} more in the other aspects of dance music, Tolfrey dove into production work. Beginning his work through the moniker Out-ed, Tolfrey gained success through his initial releases and was later invited by reputable label, Crosstown Rebels for production releases. Through his enthusiasm for electronic music and interest in experimentation, Tolfrey started his own label, Leftroom in 2005. Tolfrey sought after an avenue to release his peer's music and open up opportunities for friends that he believed in. The first release was entitled The Extended Family EP encapsulating the spirit of Leftroom, {{a place where a}} core set of artists could grow and experiment with their sound. After remarkable success with the first few releases and securing a home-grown and exceptional roster Tolfrey was asked to commence a label night at <b>T</b> <b>Bar,</b> London's hub of creativity in the house and techno scene. Expanding on the idea of Leftroom, Tolfrey put forth two sub-labels to the Leftroom family: Leftroom Limited has the purpose of releasing peak-time records while Leftout is a home for lesser known artists who deserve some attention. In 2012 Matt Tolfrey put out his first full-length album Word of Mouth on Leftroom Records.
