5|$|Each Surface overworld had a {{specific}} theme: the forest overworld revolved around landforms altering gameplay, the volcano overworld focused around {{changing the rules}} of gameplay, while the desert overworld was themed around duality between past and present. The first areas, the Sealed Grounds and Faron Woods, were created so players could be eased into the game's mechanics and navigation. While the forest areas were made to be mostly flat, the Eldin Volcano overworld was made with height differences in mind to provide a greater challenge. Elements in the volcano terrain included areas of lava, and slopes where Link's sprinting ability would become necessary for reaching new areas. For the Lanayru Desert, the team created three different overworld zones due to its unique <b>time</b> <b>shifting</b> mechanics, triggered with Time Shift stones: this shifting between different zones was inspired by similar systems in Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess. The portable Time Shift stones were one of many ideas included in the desert overworld as they did not fit with the forest or volcano environments. A difficult feature to include naturally was the remnants of Lanayru's Ancient Civilization, which used electricity to power both its technology and citizens. Enemy types that recurred in all Surface-based overworld areas were given slightly altered designs so they would be unique to each overworld. The Silent Realms were created as a new mechanic, filled with enemies {{that could not be}} defeated and relying on Link's sprinting ability rather than his weapons or items. While they had experimented with indestructible enemies in Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks, but this time it was changed by restricting Link's options and actions. They also created a time limit for added strategy, as knowledge of the areas where the Spirit Realms were located was key to completing them. This was also why they were set up in areas players would already be familiar with. They were originally in the form of special dungeons, but this was discarded in favor of the familiar areas.|$|E

The sequence of <b>time</b> <b>shifts</b> computed by this method are a globally optimal solution to a non-linear optimization problem with linear inequality constraints that may be directly related to subsurface properties. In applications to seismic traces, the <b>time</b> <b>shifts</b> may increase or decrease rapidly in time (and space). However, when related to integrals of subsurface parameters, such variations in <b>time</b> <b>shifts</b> are often smooth. A new method for smooth dynamic warping exploits this inherent smoothness to increase the accuracy of <b>time</b> <b>shift</b> estimates, especially where differences between seismic traces to be aligned {{are not limited to}} <b>time</b> <b>shifts.</b> The new method requires only a few simple modifications to the classic method, and can be easily extended to multidimensional image warping as well.

40|$|Modeling of <b>time</b> <b>shifts</b> {{associated}} with time-lapse (4 D) seismic surveys is helpful in evaluating reservoir depressurization and inverting for subsurface stress. Here, we discuss <b>time</b> <b>shifts</b> estimated from synthetic seismic data and analyze {{their dependence on}} reflector depth and pressure drop inside the reservoir. Accurate <b>time</b> <b>shift</b> measurements between baseline and monitor surveys are obtained by advanced processing techniques that are potentially applicable to field data. Coupled geomechanical and seismic modeling is used to study <b>time</b> <b>shifts</b> for parameters close to those for West Texas petroleum reservoirs. Time-shift leads and lags for P-, PS-, and S-waves are estimated {{for a wide range}} (10 % to 50 %) of effective depressurizations. For the largest pressure drop, P-wave time lags reach 45 ms for reflectors above the reservoir, while S-wave leads reach 90 ms for reflectors below the reservoir. We also investigate the contributions of the deviatoric and volumetric stains to the <b>time</b> <b>shifts,</b> and show that the deviatoric strain is largely responsible for P-wave anisotropy near the reservoir. <b>Time</b> <b>shifts</b> for S-waves and, to a lesser extent, PS-waves, are strongly influenced by the volumetric strain inside the reservoir.

40|$|Pore-pressure {{variations}} inside producing reservoirs {{result in}} excess {{stress and strain}} that cause <b>time</b> <b>shifts</b> of reflected waves. Inversion of seismic data for pressure changes requires {{better understanding of the}} dependence of compaction-induced <b>time</b> <b>shifts</b> on reservoir pressure reduction. Here, we in-vestigate pressure-dependent behavior of P-, S-, and PS-wave <b>time</b> <b>shifts</b> from reflectors located above and below a rectangular reservoir embedded in a homo-geneous half-space. Our geomechanical modeling algorithm generates the excess stress/strain field and the stress-induced stiffness tensor as linear functions of reservoir pressure.

Reilly further postulated that [...] "If it does anywhere near what it did on Thursdays, we can glue that show to the schedule because it can be a big win for us".
