500|$|After Wiggins died, several {{well-known}} baseball figures {{commented on}} his death. Longtime Oriole Frank Robinson said, [...] "He {{was a very}} bright individual, and you could like the guy. But <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> there to back you off." [...] Former Padres player Garry Templeton said {{that he might have}} been Wiggins' closest friend, but he said {{that he did not know}} that Wiggins had been ill.|$|E
500|$|In {{her letters}} to her {{siblings}} in Tobolsk, Maria described her unease {{at the new}} restrictions on the family at Yekaterinburg. She and her parents were searched by guards at the Ipatiev House and were warned they {{would be subject to}} further searches. A wooden fence was installed around the house, limiting their view of the street. [...] "Oh, how complicated everything is now," [...] she wrote on May 2, 1918. [...] "We lived so peacefully for eight months and now it's all started again." [...] Maria passed the time by attempting to befriend members of the Ipatiev House Guard. She showed them pictures from her photo albums and talked with them about their families and her own hopes for a new life in England if she was released. Alexander Strekotin, one of the guards, recalled in his memoirs that she [...] "was a girl who loved to have fun." [...] Another of the guards recalled Maria's buxom beauty with appreciation and said she didn't assume an air of grandeur. One former sentry recalled that Maria was often scolded by her mother in [...] "severe and angry whispers," [...] apparently for being too friendly with the guards at Yekaterinburg. Strekotin wrote that their conversations always began with one of the girls saying, [...] "We're so bored! In Tobolsk <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> to do. I know! Try to guess the name of this dog!" [...] The teenage girls walked by the sentries, whispering and giggling in a manner that the guards considered flirtatious.|$|E
2500|$|Almost 40 years later, writer Peter Guralnick {{wrote that}} Presley found it [...] "good {{running around with}} Nick... <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> happening, and the hotel suite was like a private clubhouse where you needed to know the secret {{password}} {{to get in and}} he got to change the password every day." [...] Presley's girlfriend June Juanico complained the singer was always talking about his friend Adams and James Dean. She also was upset that Adams had started inviting himself to see Elvis, and Juanico felt that she was trying to compete for Elvis' attention. Adams would talk often about Natalie Wood to Elvis, constantly discussing her figure and her beauty, something else that caused Juanico to feel that she would soon lose Elvis to the glitz of Hollywood. Presley's own mother even commented about Adams, [...] "He sure is a pushy little fellow".|$|E

2500|$|Encouraged by her father, Bow {{continued}} to visit studio agencies asking for parts. [...] "But <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something.</b> I was too young, or too little, or too fat. Usually I was too fat." [...] Eventually, director Elmer Clifton needed a tomboy for his movie Down to the Sea in Ships, saw Bow in Motion Picture Classic magazine, and sent for her. In {{an attempt to}} overcome her youthful looks, Bow put her hair up and arrived in a dress she [...] "sneaked" [...] from her mother. Clifton said she was too old, but broke into laughter as the stammering Bow made him believe she was {{the girl in the}} magazine. Clifton decided to bring Bow with him and offered her $35 a week. Bow held out for $50 and Clifton agreed, but he could not say whether she would [...] "fit the part". Bow later learned that one of Brewsters' subeditors had urged Clifton to give her a chance.|$|E

60|$|The {{evening was}} the most {{interesting}} time for Ken. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> lively going on. He wondered when the boys studied. When some of the outside students dropped in there were banjo and guitar playing, college songs, and college gossip.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wain {{recognised}} his visitor {{and opened}} the window. Mr. Appleby could not help feeling how like Wain it was {{to work on a}} warm summer's night in a hermetically sealed room. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> queer and eccentric about Wyatt's step-father.|$|E
60|$|The old unhappy feeling pervaded my life. It was deepened, if it {{were changed}} at all; {{but it was as}} {{undefined}} as ever, and addressed me like a strain of sorrowful music faintly heard in the night. I loved my wife dearly, and I was happy; but the happiness I had vaguely anticipated, once, was not the happiness I enjoyed, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> wanting.|$|E

60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> {{to do when}} he wearied of that until, {{almost before}} the day had {{properly}} begun, up came George with one of his celebrated dinners. And then began the incursion of his friends. One by one they would drop in, making themselves very much at home, to help their host through till bedtime. And another day would slip into the past.|$|E
6000|$|... "And you'll {{take a bite}} of {{something}} before you start, ma'am," [...] she said, out loud. But, no; it was only now twelve o'clock, {{and she would be}} at Bowes Lodge a very little after one. She had still sufficient confidence in Lord Stapledean to feel sure of her lunch. When people reached Hurst Staple Vicarage about that hour, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> for them to eat. And so she started.|$|E
60|$|And Amabel {{always liked}} to be shut in by herself, dearly as she loved them all, and mamma especially; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> {{pleasant}} {{in being able to}} return to her own world, to rest in the thoughts of her husband, and in the possession of the little unconscious creature that had come to inhabit that inner world of hers, the creature that was only his and hers.|$|E

6000|$|Newman {{continued}} {{to see his}} friends the Tristrams with {{a good deal of}} frequency, though if you had listened to Mrs. Tristram's account of the matter you would have supposed that they had been cynically repudiated for the sake of grander acquaintance. [...] "We were all very well so long as we had no rivals--we were better than nothing. But now that you have become the fashion, and have your pick every day of three invitations to dinner, we are tossed into the corner. I am sure it is very good of you to come and see us once a month; I wonder you don't send us your cards in an envelope. When you do, pray have them with black edges; it will be for the death of my last illusion." [...] It was in this incisive strain that Mrs. Tristram moralized over Newman's so-called neglect, which was in reality a most exemplary constancy. Of course she was joking, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> ironical in her jokes, as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> jocular in her gravity.|$|E
60|$|Leaving the bilious and {{mathematical}} exactitude, the preposterous peace of that backwater, he thought suddenly: 'During coverture! Why can't they exclude fellows like Profond, {{instead of a}} lot of hard-working Germans?' and was surprised at the depth of uneasiness which could provoke so unpatriotic a thought. But there it was! One never got a moment of real peace. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> at the back of everything! And he made his way toward Green Street.|$|E
60|$|And so it {{came about}} that she had her desire and was able {{practically}} to monopolize Kirk. He and she and William Bannister lived {{in a kind of}} hermit's cell for three and enjoyed this highly unnatural state of things enormously. Life had never seemed so full either to Kirk or herself. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> to do, something to think about, something to look forward to, if it was only a visit to a theatre or the inspection of William Bannister's bath.|$|E

60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> in her modest {{voice that}} seemed to touch a chord within me, {{answering}} to that sound alone. It was always earnest; {{but when it was}} very earnest, as it was now, there was a thrill in it that quite subdued me. I sat looking at her as she cast her eyes down on her work; I sat seeming still to listen to her; and Steerforth, in spite of all my attachment to him, darkened in that tone.|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> to watch.

And he actually managed to put them to rights. Great sigh of relief when the vans rocked out of the market.|$|E
60|$|In {{the great}} {{city in which}} he lived <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>something</b> going on; every day many strangers came there. One day two impostors arrived who gave {{themselves}} out as weavers, {{and said that they}} knew how to manufacture the most beautiful cloth imaginable. Not only were the texture and pattern uncommonly beautiful, but the clothes which were made of the stuff possessed this wonderful property that they were invisible to anyone who was not fit for his office, or who was unpardonably stupid.|$|E
