40|$|The {{increasing}} {{international trade}} in {{fresh fruit and vegetables}} has started to raise concerns about the distance that food travels and the emissions associated with its transport. The term food miles has been coined to capture the number of miles (kilometres) that food travels through a supply chain, from producer to consumer. The simple logic of food miles is the further that a food product has travelled, the more energy is consumed, the more greenhouse gases are produced, and the greater the impact on the environment. Food and air miles are simplistic concepts and not indicators of sustainability or environmental impact. A leading UK organic certifier, the Soil Association recently proposed changes in <b>the</b> <b>certification</b> <b>criteria</b> for the labelling of air freighted organic fruit and vegetables.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Patient {{decision}} support interventions are not currently subject to standardized quality control. The current study aims {{to assess the}} feasibility of applying a proposed set of minimum standards (previously developed {{as part of a}} possible certification process) to a selection of existing patient {{decision support}} interventions. METHODS: A convenience sample of interventions selected from those included in the 2009 Cochrane systematic review of patient decision aids was scored by trained raters using the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) instrument. Scores were then evaluated against the published proposed minimum standards. RESULTS: Twenty-five out of thirty included interventions met all qualifying criteria while only three met the proposed certification criteria. The changes required for an intervention to meet the proposed certification standards were relatively minor. There was considerable variation between raters' mean scores. CONCLUSIONS: Most interventions did not meet <b>the</b> <b>certification</b> <b>criteria</b> due to lack of information on modifiable items such as update policy and funding source.

40|$|Researchers are {{increasingly}} {{required to make}} research data publicly available in data repositories. Although several organisations propose criteria to recommend and evaluate the quality of data repositories, {{there is no consensus}} of what constitutes a good data repository. In this paper, we investigate, first, which data repositories are recommended by various stakeholders (publishers, funders, and community organizations) and second, which repositories are certified by a number of organisations. We then compare these two lists of repositories, and the criteria for recommendation and certification. We find that criteria used by organisations recommending and certifying repositories are similar, although <b>the</b> <b>certification</b> <b>criteria</b> are generally more detailed. We distil the lists of criteria into seven main categories: “Mission”, “Community/Recognition”, “Legal and Contractual Compliance”, “Access/Accessibility”, “Technical Structure/Interface”, “Retrievability” and “Preservation”. Although the criteria are similar, the lists of repositories that are recommended by the various agencies are very different. Out of all of the recommended repositories, less than 6 % obtained certification. As certification is becoming more important, steps should be taken to decrease this gap between recommended and certified repositories, and ensure that certification standards become applicable, and applied, to the repositories which researchers are currently using...|$|E

Meanwhile, the germination index is a well–known parameter when measuring the maturity of fertilizer. Several methods are advised for measuring the germination of compost–based fertilizer. Until now, there was no specific method for certifying or performing a germination index test for liquid fertilizers. In this study, the ordinary germination index (GI) or Solid fertilizer germination Index (SFGI) is performed for 23 solid–composted fertilizers to evaluate the method 2 ̆ 7 s applicability when the average SFGI count is 137. However, when this method is applied to 26 liquid anaerobic manures, the average SFGI count was 22, with germination only happening for eight samples.

40|$|Background: Awareness of {{lung cancer}} {{screening}} remains low in the screening-eligible population, and when patients visit their clinician never having heard {{of lung cancer}} screening, engaging in shared decision making to arrive at an informed decision can be a challenge. Therefore, methods to effectively support both patients and clinicians to engage in these important discussions are essential. To facilitate shared decision making about lung cancer screening, effective methods to prepare patients to have these important discussions with their clinician are needed. Objective: Our objective {{is to develop a}} computer-tailored decision support tool that meets <b>the</b> <b>certification</b> <b>criteria</b> of the International Patient Decision Aid Standards instrument version 4. 0 that will support shared decision making in lung cancer screening decisions. Methods: Using a 3 -phase process, we will develop and test a prototype of a computer-tailored decision support tool in a sample of lung cancer screening-eligible individuals. In phase I, we assembled a community advisory board comprising 10 screening-eligible individuals to develop the prototype. In phase II, we recruited a sample of 13 screening-eligible individuals to test the prototype for usability, acceptability, and satisfaction. In phase III, we are conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 60 screening-eligible participants who have never been screened for lung cancer. Outcomes tested include lung cancer and screening knowledge, lung cancer screening health beliefs (perceived risk, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and self-efficacy), perception of being prepared to engage in a patient-clinician discussion about lung cancer screening, occurrence of a patient-clinician discussion about lung cancer screening, and stage of adoption for lung cancer screening. Results: Phases I and II are complete. Phase III is underway. As of July 15, 2017, 60 participants have been enrolled into the study, and have completed the baseline survey, intervention, and first follow-up survey. We expect to have results by December 31, 2017 and to have data analysis completed by March 1, 2018. Conclusions: Results from usability testing indicate that the computer-tailored decision support tool is easy to use, is helpful, and provides a satisfactory experience for the user. At the conclusion of phase III (pilot RCT), we will have preliminary effect sizes to inform a future fully powered RCT on changes in (1) knowledge about lung cancer and screening, (2) perceived risk of lung cancer, (3) perceived benefits of lung cancer screening, (4) perceived barriers to lung cancer screening, (5) self-efficacy for lung cancer screening, and (6) perceptions of being adequately prepared to engage in a discussion with their clinician about lung cancer screening...|$|E
