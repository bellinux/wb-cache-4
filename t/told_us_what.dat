Guitarist Turner noted: [...] "After we were done we brought them in for the record company to hear, with an eye to making plans for next year. They heard what we were doing and said, 'Well, let's finish the album you're working on.' And we thought, 'Album? We're just demoing.' But they <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> we had was great, so we went back into the studio with Arn and did just that." [...] Over the next two months, the band worked to complete the album with Arnold Lanni at Arnyard Studios in Toronto as well as Avatar Studios in New York City. Rumors had surfaced that, while in New York, Our Lady peace had dropped Lanni as producer to work with The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan. These rumors were later debunked by Maida. The first songs to be played live were [...] "Life" [...] and [...] "Everyone's a Junkie", which debuted during Summersault in August 2000 shortly after they were first recorded. In an August 2000 interview with Chartattack Raine revealed that a song titled [...] "Yesterday" [...] (later to become [...] "Middle of Yesterday") was almost guaranteed to be the first single for Spiritual Machines.|$|E
2500|$|Among those {{expelled}} was {{the family}} of Sendel and Riva Grynszpan, Polish Jews who had emigrated to Germany in 1911 and settled in Hanover, Germany. At the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961, Sendel Grynszpan recounted the events of their deportation from Hanover {{on the night of}} 27 October 1938: [...] "Then they took us in police trucks, in prisoners' lorries, about 20 men in each truck, and they took us to the railway station. The streets were full of people shouting: Juden raus! Auf nach Palästina!" [...] ("Jews out, out to Palestine!"). Their seventeen-year-old son Herschel was living in Paris with an uncle. Herschel received a postcard from his family from the Polish border, describing the family's expulsion: [...] "No one <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> was up, but we realised {{this was going to be}} the end ... We haven't a penny. Could you send us something?" [...] He received the postcard on 3 November 1938.|$|E

On February 27, 1974, Maryland's Governor Mandel {{pulled the plug on}} the idea. Orioles owner Jerold Hoffberger was blunt: [...] "I will bow to the will of the people. They have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> they want to tell us. First, they don't want a new park and second, they don't want a club." [...] Robert Irsay was willing to wait. [...] "It's not a matter of saying {{that there will be no}} stadium. It's a matter of getting the facts together so everybody is happy when they build the stadium. I'm a patient man. I think the people of Baltimore are going to see those new stadiums in New Orleans and Seattle opening in a year or two around the country, and they are going to realize they need a stadium ... for conventions and other things besides football." ...|$|E

By comparison, Metacritic calculated an average score of 52/100 from 19 reviews. Roger Ebert observed the homages to the 1950s science fiction B movies. [...] "Ed Wood himself could have <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>what's</b> wrong with this movie: the makers felt superior to the material. To be funny, even schlock has to believe in itself.

40|$|Reproduced {{with the}} {{permission}} of Andrew Baker and Ian FriendIt is often assumed that structure is the antithesis of chaos, that architecture must define itself against nature’s randomness. But things are not that simple. The Italian Rationalist architects of the 1930 s, for example, argued that a mathematical equation known as the Golden Section was visible in nature. The fact that the structure of nautilus shells adhered to this formula was read as evidence that order pervaded the natural world. Similarly, chaos theory has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>what</b> seems like disorganized activity in nature conforms to patterns that have shape and form. Open Acces...|$|R

He had gratified his appetite for blood, and this was all. There is something singularly pleasing, both in the amusement of execution-seeing, and in the results. You are not only delightfully excited at the time, but most pleasingly relaxed afterwards; the mind, which has been wound up painfully until now, becomes quite complacent and easy. There is something agreeable in the misfortunes of others, as the philosopher has <b>told</b> <b>us.</b> Remark <b>what</b> a good breakfast you eat after an execution; how pleasant it is to cut jokes after it, and upon it.
