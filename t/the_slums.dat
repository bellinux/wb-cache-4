40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how Dhaka slum dwellers frame health {{as part of}} the broader experience of living in <b>the</b> <b>slum.</b> <b>The</b> manifestation of health within slums has typically been analyzed within the context of wider power structures shaping <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> as a marginal and unhealthy locality. This study moves beyond the idea of <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> as a site of marginalization, toward the image of <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> as a ‘lived world’. In analyzing health as an intrinsic part of the lived world of <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> I unfold a phenomenological approach that presupposes an integral conception of the body and the outer world. The acknowledgment of this phenomenological ‘body-world pact’ is instrumental in grasping how health is experienced in relation to the wider environment. As such, a phenomenological approach is particularly appropriate for analyzing (ill-) health within <b>the</b> context of <b>slums,</b> where unwholesome living conditions account for a high prevalence of disease. Drawing on fieldwork conducted in a Dhaka slum, I will show how slum dwellers come to include physical, economic and social aspects of <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> environment {{as part of the}}ir health experience. Health is thus presented as emerging at the nexus between the body and its wider socio-material environment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} spectacle and worlding. Using Dharavi as the site (cite) of analysis, the paper considers how slum tours, art and television documentaries produce particular narratives and imaginaries of <b>the</b> <b>slum.</b> We move beyond the discussions of voyeurism and the aestheticisation of poverty and suggest that the knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> is entangled with the motives, preconceptions and experiences of multiple actors, giving <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> a relation with the “world” that holds opportunities to disrupt hegemonic views of urbanism, while centering its own position as a locus of knowledge on urban poverty. The paper suggests that analysing the spectacle of <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> through <b>the</b> lens of worlding offers ways to think critically of how urban space is reordered and urban knowledge is produced and circulated...|$|R
50|$|Critics {{argue that}} slum removal by force tends {{to ignore the}} social {{problems}} that cause slums. Poor families, often including children and working adults, {{need a place to}} live when adequate low income housing is not providing otherwise. Moreover, slums are frequently sites of informal economies that provide jobs, services, and livelihoods not otherwise available in <b>the</b> community. <b>Slum</b> clearance removes <b>the</b> <b>slum,</b> but it does not remove the causes that create and maintain <b>the</b> <b>slum.</b> Similarly, plans to remove slums in a number of non-Western contexts have proven ineffective without sufficient housing and other support for the displaced communities; for example academics describing such strategies as detrimental in Nigeria, where <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> destruction puts further stress on already short housing stock, in some cases create new slums {{in other parts of the}} community. Some communities have opted for slum upgrading, as an alternative solution: improving the quality of services and infrastructure to match the community developed in <b>the</b> <b>slum.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1884, the Settlement {{movement}} was founded, with settlements such as Toynbee Hall and Oxford House, to encourage university students {{to live and}} work in <b>the</b> <b>slums,</b> experience the conditions and try to alleviate some of the poverty and misery in the East End. Notable residents of Toynbee Hall included R. H. Tawney, Clement Attlee, Guglielmo Marconi, and William Beveridge. The Hall continues to exert considerable influence, with the Workers Educational Association (1903), Citizens Advice Bureau (1949) and Child Poverty Action Group (1965) all being founded or influenced by it. In 1888, the matchgirls of Bryant and May in Bow went on strike for better working conditions. This, combined with the many dock strikes in the same era, made the East End a key element in the foundation of modern socialist and trade union organisations, as well as the Suffragette movement.|$|E
5|$|Soedjatmoko later {{attended}} the Surabaya HBS (secondary school) and graduated in 1940. The school {{introduced him to}} Latin and Greek, {{and one of his}} teachers introduced him to European art; he later recalled that this introduction had allowed him to see Europeans as more than colonists. He then continued to medical school in Batavia (modern day Jakarta). Upon seeing <b>the</b> <b>slums</b> of Jakarta, he was drawn to the issue of poverty; this later became an academic interest of his. However, during the Japanese occupation, in 1943, he was expelled from the city due to his relationship with Sutan Sjahrir– who had married Soedjatmoko's sister Siti Wahyunah– and participation in protests against the occupation.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Nilin (Kezia Burrows), an Errorist imprisoned in the Bastille Fortress, is having almost all her memory wiped by Memorize. As she {{is taken to}} have {{the last of her}} {{memories}} wiped, a mysterious man called Edge, the leader of the Errorists and a man she only hears over her comm device, helps her escape. Edge tells her that she is an Errorist with the gift of both stealing and remixing memories. After escaping into <b>the</b> <b>slums</b> of Neo-Paris, Nilin encounters Tommy, a fellow Errorist. Nilin and Tommy are attacked by Olga Sedova, a bounty hunter chasing Nilin. Nilin dives into Olga's mind and remixes her memory to make Olga believe that her husband was killed by a Memorize doctor. She then becomes an Errorist ally, and transports Nilin to her first destination. Arriving in the Saint-Michel district, Nilin, who is aided by another Errorist codenamed Bad Request, is told by Edge to steal secret codes from Kaori Sheridan, Neo-Paris' top architect. After retrieving and uploading the codes to Edge, he uses them to open the Saint-Michel dam, flooding the district. Due to the flood draining out <b>the</b> <b>slums,</b> Nilin is able to infiltrate the Bastille and heads to the memory servers to free the stored memories of herself and the inmates while taking down Madame, the sadistic manager of the Bastille. With Madame defeated, Nilin releases the memories of the inmates and partially regains some of her own. She remembers the crime that landed her in the Bastille; on a mission, Nilin remixed the mind of a Memorize commander and made him believe he had killed his girlfriend. The altered memory pushed him to commit suicide.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, Sleaford's {{population}} more than doubled from 1,596 in 1801 to 3,539 in 1851. Coinciding with this is the construction or extension of public buildings, often by the local contractors Charles Kirk and Thomas Parry. The gasworks opened in 1839 to provide gas lighting in the town. Sleaford's Poor Law Union was formed in 1836 to cater for the town and the surrounding 54 parishes. The workhouse was constructed by 1838 and could house 181 inmates. Despite these advances, <b>the</b> <b>slums</b> around Westgate were over-crowded, lacking sanitation and disease-ridden; the local administration failed to deal with the matter until 1850, when a report on the town's public health by the General Board of Health heavily criticised the situation and set up a Local Board of Health to undertake public works. By the 1880s, Lord Bristol had allowed clean water to be pumped into the town, but engineering problems and a reluctance to sell land to house the turbines had delayed the introduction of sewers.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{and many}} {{concerned}} reformers had been attempting {{to improve the}} housing of the working classes since the early 1830s. When Hill began her work, the model dwelling movement had been in existence for twenty years, royal and select committees had sat to examine the problems of urban well-being, and {{the first of many}} tranches of legislation aimed at improving working class housing had been passed. From Hill's point of view these had all failed the poorest members of the working class, the unskilled labourers. She found that their landlords routinely ignored their obligations towards their tenants, and that the tenants were too ignorant and oppressed to better themselves. She tried to find new homes for her charges, but there was a severe shortage of available property, and Hill decided that her only solution was to become a landlord herself. John Ruskin, who was interested in the co-operative guild, knew Hill from her work as his copyist and was impressed by her. As an aesthete and a humanitarian he was affronted by the brutal ugliness of <b>the</b> <b>slums.</b> In 1865, having inherited a substantial sum of money from his father, he acquired for £750 the leases of three cottages of six rooms each in Paradise Place, Marylebone.|$|E
