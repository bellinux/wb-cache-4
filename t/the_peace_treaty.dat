5|$|On 16 June, the Allied Powers {{demanded that}} Germany unconditionally sign the treaty within seven days or face the {{resumption}} of hostilities. The German government was divided on whether to sign or reject <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>treaty.</b> On 19 June, Chancellor Philipp Scheidemann resigned rather than sign the treaty and was followed by Brockdorff-Rantzau {{and other members of}} the government, leaving Germany without a cabinet or peace delegation. After being advised by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg that Germany was in no condition to resume the war, President Friedrich Ebert and the new Chancellor, Gustav Bauer, recommended that the Weimar National Assembly ratify the treaty. The Assembly did so by a large majority, and Clemenceau was informed nineteen minutes before the deadline expired. Germany unconditionally signed <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>treaty</b> on 22 June.|$|E

Thus, without resorting to another major war, Sadat had been able to regain the Sinai through diplomatic means.|$|E
