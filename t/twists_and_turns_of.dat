25|$|Gabriel was devotedly in love, but {{he could}} not marry his {{mistress}} because the Romanov's family status forbade any morganatic union.

25|$|The {{official}} {{cause of}} the Sultana disaster {{was determined to be}} mismanagement of water levels in the boiler, exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} vessel was severely overcrowded and top heavy. As the steamboat made her way north following the <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> the river, she listed severely to one side then the other. Her four boilers were interconnected and mounted side-by-side, so that if the boat tipped sideways, water would tend to run out of the highest boiler. With the fires still going against the empty boiler, this created hot spots. When the boat tipped the other way, water rushing back into the empty boiler would hit the hot spots and flash instantly to steam, creating a sudden surge in pressure. This effect of careening could have been minimized by maintaining high water levels in the boilers. The official inquiry found that the boat's boilers exploded due to the combined effects of careening, low water level, and a faulty repair to a leaky boiler made a few days earlier.|$|E

500|$|Frankenstein, {{like much}} Gothic fiction of the period, mixes a [...] and alienating subject matter with {{speculative}} and thought-provoking themes. Rather {{than focusing on}} the <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> the plot, however, the novel foregrounds the mental and moral struggles of the protagonist, Victor Frankenstein, and Shelley imbues the text with her own brand of politicised Romanticism, one that criticised the individualism and egotism of traditional Romanticism. Victor Frankenstein is like Satan in Paradise Lost, and Prometheus: he rebels against tradition; he creates life; and he shapes his own destiny. These traits are not portrayed positively; as Blumberg writes, [...] "his relentless ambition is a self-delusion, clothed as quest for truth". He must abandon his family to fulfill his ambition.|$|E
500|$|After a {{gestation}} period of 1013 months, females {{give birth to}} litters of 16 (usually 23) pups. The number of offspring is not correlated with female size; each female produces an estimated average of 12 pups over her entire lifetime. Parturition occurs from May to August (autumn and winter) in French Polynesia, in July (summer) off Enewetak Atoll, and in October (summer) off Australia. Females give birth while swimming, making violent <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> their bodies; each pup takes under an hour to fully emerge. The newborns measure [...] long and have relatively longer caudal fins than adults. This shark develops slowly compared to other requiem sharks; newborns grow {{at a rate of}} [...] per year while adults grow as a rate of [...] per year.

On the Great Barrier Reef, males live to 14 years and females to 19 years; the maximum lifespan of this shark may be upwards of 25 years. In 2008, a whitetip reef shark produced a single pup through possibly asexual means at the Nyiregyhaza Centre in Hungary; previous instances of asexual reproduction in sharks {{have been reported in the}} bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo) and the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus).|$|E

2500|$|The National Guardian's {{coverage}} of the <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> the Rosenberg case was particularly passionate, with the paper helping to coordinate the legal defense {{efforts on behalf of}} the jailed New Yorkers {{at a time when the}} Communist Party and its Daily Worker attempted to distance itself from the unpopular case.

2500|$|The {{series has}} {{received}} positive critical reception; {{in reviewing the}} series premiere, Phil Dyess-Nugent of The A.V.

He wrote that [...] "the look of the thing is just the delivery system, though there are some striking images and even the occasional striking piece of 'acting'". He described the animation as looking [...] "fairly cheap"; however, he complemented the [...] "soft, pastel-colored style that blunts the obnoxiousness {{of some of the}} jokes without blurring out the edge", he stated, that contrasts the style of Adult Swim programs. Jason Zinoman of The New York Times called the series [...] "gleefully deranged", stating the writing of the series [...] "threatens to but never quite tips over into the overwritten cleverness of so much television comedy these days."

2500|$|The love {{triangle}} of Sharon, Nick and Phyllis garnered attention {{and was considered}} one of the genre's most titillating storylines.

Stafford replied, [...] "In a perfect world, she'd wish [...] Nick's. But he's married; he's not going to leave Sharon. And she doesn't want him to." [...] The triangle was also a topic of debate during its run. Daniel R. Coleridge of TV Guide labeled the week Phyllis discovered she was expecting as a [...] "can't-miss week" [...] for the popular triangle. Aubrey Hammack, a writer for AuthorsDen, analysed the storyline and published an article on the matter of adultery. He cited the storyline as realistic, [...] "Men are notorious for saying; I can separate my sexual side from my emotions. [...] Well, unless you are a person without a conscience, this is impossible. [...] Most men just don’t realize that once you have sex with someone, that the emotions kick in not to mention the feelings of being in love and caring about that someone you are having the affair with. [...] When this happens, things spin wildly out of control."

It contains fights and shootouts and big chase scenes, but they're all firmly centered on who the characters are and what they mean to one another". In his review for the Globe and Mail, Jay Scott wrote, [...] "F/X is simply out to give a good time, which it does superbly". Paul Attanasio in his review for the Washington Post praised Brian Dennehy's performance: [...] "Dennehy brings magic to the role - he's large, and he enlarges it. With his sly eyes and little can opener of a nose, his shoulders a yard wide, his hair massing in gray curls behind his ears, he dances through the movie like a mastodon in toe shoes". In his review for The Sunday Times, George Perry praised the film's premise as a [...] "nice idea, but the effects themselves are merely ingenious when they might have been spectacular". Sheila Benson wrote in her review for the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Where F/X floats above the crowd are in its performances; in the perfection of Miroslav Ondricek's photography, Mel Bourne's production design, John Stears' effects and Terry Rawlings' crisp, succinct editing; in the virtually unpredictable <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> its plot, and in the sheer joy of watching a hero use his skill and his wits to solve a problem".|$|E

Who can help being pleased, indeed, with that wonderful St. Gothard--the crystal green Reuss shattering itself in white spray into emerald pools {{by the side of the}} railway; Wasen church perched high upon its solitary hilltop; the Biaschina ravine, the cleft rocks of Faido, the serpentine <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>of</b> the ramping line as it mounts or descends its spiral zigzags? Dewy Alpine pasture, tossed masses of land-slip, white narcissus on the banks, snowy peaks in the background--all alike were fresh visions of delight to Herminia; and she drank it all in with the pure childish joy of a poetic nature. It was the Switzerland of her dreams, reinforced and complemented by unsuspected detail.|$|E

Clearly, at any rate, in her hands, the clue to the antique confidence had lost itself, and repose, however founded, had given way to curiosity--that is to speculation--however disguised.
