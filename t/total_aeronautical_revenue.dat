40|$|Maximising {{revenues}} {{is one of}} {{the greatest}} challenges of regional airports especially after the introduction of deregulation and privatisation of airports with the increase of aggressive competition in the markets. The calculation of <b>aeronautical</b> <b>revenues</b> generation has always been considered as a straightforward method and airport managers generally overlooked on the importance of daily operational factors such as the different flight services offered at the airports, the type of aircraft airlines utilised, time of the day the flight arrives or departs, and the number of passengers the airlines ferry in and out of their airport, types of destination and how these factors influence the generation of <b>aeronautical</b> <b>revenues</b> for their airport. The first objective of this research is to measure the airside operation factors that influence the generation of <b>aeronautical</b> <b>revenues</b> deterministically. The influential variables were determined through literature reviews and case studies of regional airports in the Netherlands and Malaysia, and were validated with regression analysis. Preliminary model was developed based on the determinants and the model was analysed using Bayesian Network theory. Thus, the research is also geared towards developing a baseline matrix using stochastic approach to analyse the effect of airside operation factors on <b>aeronautical</b> <b>revenues</b> generation as the second objective. The next objective concerns with the formulation of mathematical optimisation algorithm known as <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Revenue</b> Optimisation Model (AROM) to generate maximum <b>aeronautical</b> <b>revenues</b> for regional airport in line with the objectives of the airport. Finally, the research embarks on developing a graphical user interface (GUI) tool based on the model to estimate the possible potential <b>aeronautical</b> <b>revenues</b> that could be generated which will be useful for airport managers in their decision making. The GUI for AROM is a user friendly tool which allows airport managers to key-in the main input parameters such as mode of operations (arrival or departure), traffic types (Schedule, Business, Charter, etc.), flights details (day or night, weekday or weekend, number of passengers, international or domestic), fleet types (aircraft weight and engine type) and type of flights (domestic or international) in order to determine the composition offlight operations that produces optimum <b>aeronautical</b> <b>revenues</b> that could be achieved. Results obtained show that the maximum revenue achieved is based on flights composition, which is more focused towards certain types of traffic types with higher frequency for each of them in contrast to the current practise of offering small number of all sorts of traffic types. The model developed in this research is flexible; it allows decision makers to set the upper bound of flight constraints. The model can also be extended to include bigger sets of flight details, for example, to have day, evening and night flight instead of just day and night. Aside from that, the parameter can also be generalised such as to consider all international flights instead of domestic and international. The traffic types can also be adjusted to include shorter or longer list of traffic types to suit the airport's services...|$|R

Airports have responded to the potential opportunities that have arisen from the growth of low cost airlines. The low cost model has implications for the airline-airport relationship, forcing airports to negotiate contracts which significantly reduce <b>aeronautical</b> <b>revenues</b> whilst seeking to address this short fall by commercial revenues via increased passenger numbers. Airports have sometimes found it difficult to turn increased passenger volume into additional revenue. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of commercial revenues to today's airports. It establishes that on average commercial revenues now account for {{about half of all}} revenues, although this varies considerably by region and individual airport, with retail being the most significant commercial source. It explores some of the key factors, such as consumer trends, security developments and political changes, which have led to a much more challenging time for commercial managers since the late- 1990 s. With growing pressure to control levels of <b>aeronautical</b> <b>revenues,</b> even greater focus on commercial revenues may be needed in the future and the paper concludes by discussing the implications of this...|$|R

For example, after acquiring a private certificate, a pilot can get an instrument rating with an additional 30-40 hours of training (if, e.g., 10 hours of instrument time was logged during private training, which would count towards <b>total</b> <b>aeronautical</b> experience gained). In {{the course of the}} commercial pilot training, most pilots also receive their high-performance and complex endorsements, as well as get a multiengine rating before applying for the Airline Transport Pilot license.|$|R
40|$|This report aims to {{describe}} how companies are estimating airports’ value through mathematical models in excel. After a brief presentation {{of the company and}} the business unit that I joined during my internship I present you an overview of project finance transactions. Then, I describe step by step all the analysis realized in the framework of airports’ due diligence process and how we integrate the information kept in the model. There are five elements that should never be neglected in a due diligence task because they are crucial for the airport’s valuation: traffic, <b>aeronautical</b> <b>revenues,</b> non-aeronautical revenues, operational expenses and capital investments. Once all these information investigated one by one, I proceed with the explication of the valuation methodology and the impact of the cost of equity calculation on it. I finally conclude by outlining how an airport valuation can affect the airport itself and its future economic development...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} traffic and {{financial}} performance of smaller UK regional airports between 2001 and 2014. Fourteen airports that typically serve less than 5 million passengers per annum {{were selected for}} the analysis. A period of strong growth in passenger demand was experienced from 2001 to 2007, driven largely by low cost carriers. The period from 2007 to 2014 was characterised by declining demand, resulting in significant losses {{for many of the}} airports. Airline strategies, {{such as the use of}} an increased unit fleet size and average sector length, may further limit future prospects for smaller UK regional airports in favour of larger ones with greater local demand. The relationship between traffic throughput and the generation of <b>aeronautical</b> <b>revenues</b> seems to vary at airports. There is generally a strong and significant relationship between traffic throughput and the generation of commercial revenues and total operating costs at airports serving 3 – 5 million passengers, but the situation for airports serving fewer than 3 million is less certain...|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Review of Network Economics [© Concept Economics] and is also available at: www. rnejournal. comThe so called low cost model has proved to be financially and operationally robust for a number of short haul airline operations in various regions world-wide and airports have responded to the potential opportunities that have arisen by the growth of low cost airlines. The low cost model has implications however for the airline-airport relationship. The low cost model has forced airports to negotiate contracts which significantly reduce <b>aeronautical</b> <b>revenues</b> whilst seeking to address this short fall by commercial revenues via increased passenger numbers. Airports have sometimes found it difficult to turn increased passenger volume into additional revenue.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Paper is to suggest {{guidelines}} {{for the provision of}} passenger, facilities Low Cost Terminals (LCTs) after reviewing a selection of LCT models at airports in the Asia Pacific, European and United States regions, and supported by an in-depth survey of passenger, airline management and airport management preferences related to operations at the Low Cost Terminal, Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The decision by airport management for the provision of specific terminal facilities (TFs) may be dependent on budget restrictions, cost of investment, land availability and the preferences of the major customers, that is, in the case of LCTs, the low-cost carriers (LCCs). Consequently, most (but not all) LCT designs are based on the concept of a basic terminal layout with limited terminal facilities in order to reduce both construction and operating costs, a shorter construction time, acceptable service standards and minimum aircraft turnaround time. However, there are contradictions. For example, passenger expectations of terminal facilities do not always coincide with those of airline and airport management. Furthermore, a consequent low level of <b>aeronautical</b> <b>revenue</b> drives the requirement to maximise commercial revenues. The paper will conclude by suggesting guidelines for LCT development that will seek to optimise the relative aspirations of all parties concerned...|$|R
40|$|Airports {{contribute}} about 5 % of {{the gross}} domestic product and employ over 7 million people in the United States. The purpose of this qualitative multiple-case study was to explore the strategies that airport managers need to increase nonaeronautical revenue. A generic strategy does not exist to assist airport operators in generating operating income. <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>revenue</b> does not always provide sufficient funding for airport operations and existing research does not consistently provide effective strategies for all airports to generate revenue. The sample for this qualitative multiple case study consisted of 3 small commercial airport managers in the southeastern North Carolina coastal region. The conceptual framework for this study was built upon general systems theory. The data were collected using semistructured interviews and review of company documents. Transcript review and member checking were used to strengthen credibility and trustworthiness. Through methodological triangulation of the data sources, 3 emergent themes were uncovered during a qualitative data analysis: types of nonaeronautical sources of revenue, strategies for measurement of success, and size and location of the airport. The findings from this study may contribute to social change by providing insight into strategies that contribute to sustainability at small airports. Existing and aspiring small airport managers may apply the findings to contribute to the success of the communities in which their airports reside and the local economies in which they operate...|$|R
40|$|While airport {{aeronautical}} {{charges are}} traditionally aircraft weight related, currently an increasing share of <b>aeronautical</b> airport <b>revenues</b> {{is derived from}} passenger related charges. This paper compares the optimal mix of per-passenger and per-flight based (cost recovering) airport charges from the carriers and the social viewpoints when carrier markets are oligopolistic. We show that positive per- passenger charges {{might be able to}} support the implementation of monopoly fares at slot-constrained airports. They can also mitigate strategic frequency reductions at uncongested airports, leading to an increase in both carrier profit and welfare relative to a charging scheme that fully relies on per-flight charges...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a model for}} the economic value of extra capacity at an airport. The model is based on a series of functional relationships linking the benefits of extra capacity and the associated costs. It takes into account the cost of delay for airlines and its indirect consequences on the airport, through the loss or gain of <b>aeronautical</b> and non-aeronautical <b>revenues.</b> The model is highly data-driven and to this end a number of data sources have been used. In particular, special care has been used {{to take into account the}} full distribution of delay at the airports rather than its average only. The results with the simple version of the model show the existence of a unique maximum for the operating profit of the airport in terms of capacity. The position of this maximum is clearly dependent on the airport and also has an interesting behaviour with the average number of passenger per aircraft at the airport and the predictability of the flight departure times. In addition, we also show that there exists an important trade-off between an increased predictability and the punctuality at the airport. Finally, it is shown that a more complex behavioural model for passengers can introduce several local maxima in the airport profit and thus drive the airport towards suboptimal decisions...|$|R
