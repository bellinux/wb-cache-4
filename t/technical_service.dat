By January 1944, the Air <b>Technical</b> <b>Service</b> Command refined the RfP and in January1945, the specifications were further revised in MX-472 to specify a jet-powered aircraft.

5|$|One {{source of}} skilled {{personnel}} was the Army itself, particularly the Army Specialized Training Program. In 1943, the MED created the Special Engineer Detachment (SED), with an authorized strength of 675. Technicians and skilled workers {{drafted into the}} Army {{were assigned to the}} SED. Another source was the Women's Army Corps (WAC). Initially intended for clerical tasks handling classified material, the WACs were soon tapped for technical and scientific tasks as well. On 1 February 1945, all military personnel assigned to the MED, including all SED detachments, were assigned to the 9812th <b>Technical</b> <b>Service</b> Unit, except at Los Alamos, where military personnel other than SED, including the WACs and Military Police, were assigned to the 4817th Service Command Unit.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} factors that {{influence}} perceived and expected daily task competencies for <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> administrators; that is, the competencies <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> administrators claim to possess (perceived) and those they believe they ought to possess (expected) in the areas of acquisitions, cataloging, and serials. For the purposes of this paper, a <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> administrator is one who oversees, at a minimum, the acquisitions, cataloging, and serials units in her library. The author surveyed 116 <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> administrators via e-mail in Fall 2003, receiving a response rate of fifty-four percent and an acceptable use rate of fifty-three percent. The survey was designed to correlate perceived and expected competencies with (1) an incumbent’s professional background; (2) tenure in current position at present institution; and (3) size of <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> unit as measured in full-time equivalents (FTE). The study concludes that incumbent tenure and size of the <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> unit affect both perceived and expected competencies, with the latter having a greater effect. Professional background affects competency possession, but has only a marginal effect on competency expectation. The findings reveal that administrators with ten or more years in their current positions, who have non-cataloging backgrounds, and who have at least ten FTE in their <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> units are least likely to know the daily procedures of their <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> units. Administrators with ten or more years in their current positions, who have cataloging backgrounds, and who have at least ten FTE in their <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> units are least likely to feel they ought to know the daily procedures of their <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> departments.

40|$|Lihong Zhu, “The Role of Paraprofessionals in <b>Technical</b> <b>Services</b> in Academic Libraries,” Poster session {{accepted}} for presentation at Washington State University Academic Showcase, March 30, 2012, Pullman, Wash. The poster {{reports on the}} research findings about the roles of paraprofessionals in <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> in academic libraries in the previous five years. Due to factors including technological advances, budget cuts, reorganizations, downsizing, outsourcing, expanded roles of professionals {{and changes in the}} information world, the workload among professionals and paraprofessionals has been redistributed in <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> in academic libraries. Today, paraprofessionals manage major functional areas in <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> and dominate the <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> work force. The roles of paraprofessionals have expanded to include duties that used to be considered the sole responsibilities of professionals in <b>technical</b> <b>services.</b> In 2011, the author conducted a survey to understand more about the roles of paraprofessionals in <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> in academic libraries in the previous five years. The survey was designed to answer the following research questions: 1. 	In the previous five years, what educational degrees and high-level skills are required for the positions of professionals and paraprofessionals in <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> in academic libraries according to their official job descriptions? What are the similarities and differences? 2. 	In the previous five years, what complex duties are regularly assigned (i. e., officially part of the job description) to professionals and paraprofessionals in <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> in academic libraries, either full or part time?

In the previous five years, have the roles of paraprofessionals in <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> in academic libraries been expanded, grown smaller, or remained the same in complex duties? 4.

Its role was to support the bomb delivery effort. Parsons became the head of Project Alberta, with Ramsey as his scientific and technical deputy, and Ashworth as his operations officer and military alternate. In all, Project Alberta consisted of 51 Army, Navy and civilian personnel. The 1st <b>Technical</b> <b>Service</b> Detachment, to which the personnel of Project Alberta were administratively assigned, was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Peer de Silva, and provided security and housing services on Tinian.
