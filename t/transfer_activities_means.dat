40|$|The {{cellular}} {{content of}} phospholipid <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> in Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides was examined {{as a function}} of both oxygen partial pressure and light intensity used for growth. Cells grown under high light conditions (100 W/m 2) had over two times the cellular level of phospholipid <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> when compared with cells grown under other conditions. Although cells grown under low light conditions (3 W/m 2) had the lowest amount of total phospholipid <b>transfer</b> <b>activity,</b> they had the highest level (49 %) of membrane-associated <b>transfer</b> <b>activity.</b> The soluble phospholipid <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> was further localized into periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions. The distribution of phospholipid <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> in cells grown under medium light intensity (10 W/m 2) was calculated as 15. 1 % membrane-associated, 32. 4 % in the periplasm, and 52. 5 % in the cytoplasm. The phospholipid <b>transfer</b> <b>activities</b> in the periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions had distinctly different properties with respect to their molecular weights (56, 000 versus 27, 000) and specificities of transfer (phosphatidylethanolamine greater than phosphatidylglycerol versus phosphatidylglycerol greater than phosphatidylethanolamine) ...|$|R

It is shown that factors which are neither {{part of the}} knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> nor part of the participating institution may have {{significant impact on the}} potential usefulness of knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>activities.</b> Differences in the potential usefulness are leading to different initial conditions of the knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>activities.</b> This needs {{to be taken into account}} when comparing different knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>activities,</b> e. g., in program evaluations. This study is focusing on regional climate services at the German Baltic Sea coast. It is based on two surveys and experiences with two identical web tools applied on two regions with different spatial coverage. The results show that comparability among science based knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>activities</b> is strongly limited through several external impacts. The potential usefulness and thus the initial condition of a particular knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> strongly depends on (1)  the perceived priority of the focused topic, (2)  the used information channels, (3)  the conformity between the research agenda of service providing institutions and information demands in the public, as well as (4)  on the spatial coverage of a service. It is suggested to account for the described external impacts for evaluations of knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>activities.</b> The results show that the comparability of knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>activities</b> is limited and challenge the adequacy of quantitative measures in this context. Moreover, as shown in this case study, in particular regional climate services should be individually evaluated on a long term perspective, by potential user groups and/or by its real users. It is further suggested that evaluation criteria should be co-developed with these stakeholder groups...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between technology specialization and innovation performance of firms emphasizing technology <b>transfer</b> <b>activities</b> with universities as an important knowledge source in order to attenuate the opportunity costs of technological specialization. Based on an econometric analysis combining patent data and survey data on technology <b>transfer</b> <b>activities</b> of firms {{it was found that}} technology transfer is positively related with the sales share of innovative products. Following the “technology trajectory (path) ” increases the probability of an above average innovation performance. Taking into account the combined effects of <b>transfer</b> <b>activities</b> and technological specialization and in this way approximating the idea that <b>transfer</b> <b>activities</b> enable a firm to be specialized and keep the knowledge base broad and upto-date, we detect a significant positive relationship between the combined effect (transfer and specialization) and the innovation performance of a firm.

The knowledge transfer is undisputedly important subjects as knowledge provides competitive advantage to firms. Only few percentages of the Turkish textile and apparel industries {{are engaged in}} knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> although it is recorded as the largest industry in Turkish economy. Turkish textile and apparel industries are mostly run by family {{and most of them}} are either unaware or reluctant to involve in the knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>activities.</b> This study examines the knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>activities</b> in Turkish SMEs through qualitative research and quantitative analysis by undertaking extensive li terature reviews and present situationin Turkey and proposes hypotheses to test the knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>activities</b> in Turkish SMEs. T he proposed hypotheses consider various related factors (determinants) such as knowledge sharing, organisational culture, communication channel, knowledge acquisition and IT resource to analyse the overall scenario of knowledge transfer behaviour in Turkish textile and apparel industries. The analysis results indicate that in case of Turkish textile and apparel industries, the pattern of knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>activities</b> are different from the available literature and mostly affected by local environments. This report points out severalt hought provoking findings and concludes with recommendation for researchers and practitioners. The work presented in this thesis suggests a novel way forward in the development of knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>activities</b> in Turkish textile and apparel industries and, therefore it is considered that the work constitutes a valuable contribution to knowledge in this area of study.

40|$|The {{activity}} {{of knowledge and}} technology transfer from the academic side into businesses or the industrial sector through various schemes, so-called university technology transfer or academic technology transfer, involves a complex process of developing research ideas into the utilization of research. Historically, university technology transfer was triggered by amendment of the U. S. Patent Law, named the Bayh-Dole Act. Shortly after the amendment, technology <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> at U. S. universities escalated, particularly in patent and license activities. The m ovement of transfer technology was closed related to a research {{activity of}} the university and university patent in general. Through empirical study, this paper identifies technology <b>transfer</b> <b>activities</b> specifically on herbal pharmaceutical products at two Indonesian state universities, i. e.

We find that Ser- 25, Thr- 59, Pro- 78, and Glu- 248 {{make up a}} set of rat (r) PI-TP residues, substitution of which effected a dramatic reduction in the relative specific <b>activity</b> for PI <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> without significant effect on PC <b>transfer</b> <b>activity.</b> Thr- 59 was of particular interest {{as it is a}} conserved residue in a highly conserved consensus protein kinase C phosphorylation motif in metazoan PI-TPs. Replacement of Thr- 59 with Ser, Gln, Val, Ile, Asn, Asp, or Glu effectively abolished PI transfer capability but was essentially silent with respect to PC <b>transfer</b> <b>activity.</b> These findings identify rPI-TP residues that likely cooperate to form a PI head-group binding/recognition site or that lie adjacent to such a site. Finally, the selective sensitivity of the PI <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> of rPI-TP to alteration of Thr- 59 suggests a mechanism for in vivo regulation of rPI-TP activity...|$|R

40|$|The {{activity}} of cholesteryl ester transfer protein is {{instrumental in the}} distribution of cholesteryl ester between lipoproteins in plasma. We measured the {{activity of}} cholesteryl ester transfer protein in plasma, designated cholesteryl ester <b>transfer</b> <b>activity,</b> as the rate of cholesteryl ester transfer between exogenous radiolabelled low-density and high-density lipoproteins. The effect of hypothyroidism on cholesteryl ester <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> was investigated in 13 athyreotic patients who were studied in the hypothyroid condition and in the euthyroid state, after they had received triiodothyronine supplementation for 33 to 67 days. During hypothyroidism plasma total cholesterol, very-low- plus low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, plasma triacylglycerol, apolipoprotein A 1 and B were significantly higher than in the euthyroid state. Cholesteryl ester <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> was 15 % lower during hypothyroidism (P < 0. 02), and an effect of treatment duration was observed. The changes in high-density lipoprotein total cholesterol (P < 0. 02), free cholesterol (P < 0. 001), triacylglycerol (P < 0. 05) and the free cholesterol/cholesteryl ester molar ratio in high-density lipoproteins (P < 0. 01) were inversely related to the changes in cholesteryl ester <b>transfer</b> <b>activity.</b> We concluded that thyroid hormone is involved in the regulation of cholesteryl ester <b>transfer</b> protein <b>activity,</b> and that cholesteryl ester <b>transfer</b> protein <b>activity</b> {{may play a role in}} the alterations in high-density lipoprotein lipids observed in hypothyroidism...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} in vitro gene delivery mediated by asialofetuin-appended cationic liposomes (AF-liposomes) associating cyclodextrins (CyD/AF-liposomes) as a hepatocyte-selective nonviral vector. Of various CyDs, AF-liposomes associated with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CyD) (pDNA/γ-CyD/AF-liposomes) showed the highest gene <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> in HepG 2 cells without any significant cytotoxicity. In addition, γ-CyD enhanced the encapsulation ratio of pDNA with AF-liposomes, and also increased gene <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> as the entrapment ratio of pDNA into AF-liposomes was increased. γ-CyD stabilized the liposomal membrane of AF-liposomes and inhibited the release of calcein from AF-liposomes. The stabilizing effect of γ-CyD may be, at least in part, involved in the enhancing gene <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> of pDNA/γ-CyD/AF-liposomes. Therefore, these results suggest the potential use of γ-CyD for an enhancer of transfection efficiency of AF-liposomes...|$|R

Despite the university’s expanded mission and the growing role of tech transfer, the academic community has yet to produce a consistent framework for evaluating faculty <b>activities</b> in technology <b>transfer</b> and their societal benefits. In response to this situation, the authors, working as the APLU Task Force on Tenure, Promotion, and Technology Transfer, surveyed US and Canadian universities to ascertain current approaches for defining technology <b>transfer</b> <b>activities</b> and recognizing them in assessing faculty performance. Building on the results of that survey, the authors offered the following five recommendations: 1) university policy statements should acknowledge the merit of technology transfer as part of the university’s work, while including safeguards against conflicts of interest or commitment; 2) technology <b>transfer</b> <b>activities</b> should be explicitly included among the criteria relevant for promotion and tenure at the university, college, and department levels, as appropriate to the respective disciplines; 3) technology <b>transfer</b> <b>activities</b> should be an optional component of the review process, one that will be rewarded when present but not seen as a requirement for everyone; 4) recognizing the unique character of technology transfer, the criteria should be flexible enough to encompass high-quality work in many forms of creative expression; and 5) technology <b>transfer</b> <b>activities</b> should be evaluated for intellectual contribution and expected social benefit consistent with the accepted process of peer review and without reliance on artificial metrics...|$|R

CERT {{is responsible for the}} in vivo non-vesicular trafficking of ceramide between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. In this study we have examined how the membrane environment surrounding the ceramide substrate, the membrane packing density and the membrane charge, are affecting the ceramide <b>transfer</b> <b>activity.</b> To examine this we have used an anthrylvinyl-labeled ceramide analogue. We found that if ceramide is in a tightly packed environment such as in sphingomyelin or dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine containing membranes, the CERT <b>transfer</b> <b>activity</b> is markedly reduced. Ceramide in fluid membranes on the other hand are available for CERT mediated transfer. CERT also favors membranes that contain phosphatidylinositol 4 -monophospate, due to its binding capacity of the pleckstrin homology domain towards phosphatidylinositol 4 -monophospate.
