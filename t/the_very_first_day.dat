The regulation again ordered surrender of all firearms and introduced personal responsibility of land plot owners for all firearms that would be find within their property.

25|$|Along with civilians, {{captured}} Polish Army {{soldiers were}} also massacred. On <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> of invasion (1 September 1939), Polish {{prisoners of war}} (POWs) were murdered by the Wehrmacht at Pilchowice, Czuchów, Gierałtowice, Bojków, Lubliniec, Kochcice, Zawiść, Ornontowice and Wyry. The German army did not consider captured servicemen to be combatants because they fought differently from them, often avoiding direct confrontation in favor of guerrilla tactics {{in the face of}} overwhelming force. Historian Tadeusz Piotrowski estimated over 1,000 POWs executed by the Heer on the first day, while Timothy Snyder, an American historian wrote that over 3,000 POWs were killed in 63 separate shooting actions in which they were often forced to take their uniforms off. On top of executions by regular troops, more mass killings were conducted in remote areas by the newly formed Einsatzgruppen totalling 3,000 men aided by the Selbstschutz volunteer executioners, bringing the total number of killing operations to 16,000 before the end of September 1939. Before the end of the year, over 45,000 Poles had been murdered in occupied territories.|$|E
25|$|The Court reaffirmed {{and applied}} the basic {{structure}} doctrine in Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain, popularly known as Election case. The constitutionality of Article 329A, which had been inserted by the 39th Amendment in 1975 was challenged in this case. Shortly after the imposition of the Emergency, a bench of thirteen judges was hastily assembled to hear the case. Presided over by Chief Justice Ajit Nath Ray, the court had to determine {{the degree to which}} amendments were restricted by {{the basic structure}} theory. Ray, who was among the dissenters in the Kesavananda Bharati case, had been promoted to Chief Justice of India on 26 April 1973, superseding three senior Judges, Shelat, Grover and Hegde (all in the majority in the same case), which was unprecedented in Indian legal history.

25|$|The Venetians then, in a {{lightning}} move, retired their field army from Messenia and landed it at Tolo between 30 July and 4 August, {{within striking distance}} of the capital of the Peloponnese, Nauplia. On <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>day,</b> Königsmarck led his troops to capture the hill of Palamidi, then only poorly fortified, which overlooked the town. The commander of the city, Mustapha Pasha, moved the civilians to the citadel of Akronauplia, and sent urgent messages to the serasker Ismail Pasha for aid; before the Venetians managed to complete their disembarkation, Ismail Pasha arrived at Argos with 4,000 horse and 3,000 foot, and tried to assist the besieged garrison. The Venetians launched an assault against the relief army on 7 August that succeeded in taking Argos and forcing the pasha to retreat to Corinth, but for two weeks, from 16 August, Königsmarck's forces were forced to continuously repulse attacks from Ismail Pasha's forces, fight off the sorties of the besieged garrison, and cope with a new outbreak of the plague—the Hannoverians counted 1,200 out of 2,750 men as sick and wounded. On 29 August Ismail Pasha launched a large-scale attack the Venetian camp, but was heavily defeated after Morosini landed 2,000 men from the fleet on his flank. Mustapha Pasha surrendered the city on the same day, and on the next day, Morosini staged a triumphal entry in the city. The city's seven thousand Muslims, including the garrison, were transported to Tenedos. News of this major victory were greeted in Venice with joy and celebration. Nauplia became the Venetians' major base, while Ismail Pasha withdrew to Vostitsa in the northern Peloponnese after strengthening the garrisons at Corinth, which controlled the passage to Central Greece. The Ottoman forces elsewhere fell into disarray, however, when false rumours circulated that the Sultan had ordered the Peloponnese evacuated; thus at Karytaina Ottoman troops killed their commander and dispersed.|$|E

[...] Years later, Arnold's son Benedict recorded in the family record: [...] "Memm. [...] We came to Providence to Dwell the 20th of April, 1636. [...] per me Bennedict Arnold." [...] He was using the name Providence loosely, since Providence Plantation had not yet been founded. The Arnolds initially settled with Roger Williams at Seekonk near the western edge of Plymouth Colony where Rehoboth is today. [...] William Arnold stated in 1659: [...] "for as much that I was one that <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> entred [...] with some others upon the land of providence, and so laid out my money to buy and helpe pay for it". [...] The settlers could not remain in Seekonk because, if they did, Plymouth would be harangued by Massachusetts for harboring its fugitives. [...] Plymouth governor Edward Winslow gently urged Williams to move with his fellow settlers across the Seekonk River into the lands of the Narragansetts. [...] Most historians agree that it was about June 1636 when the small group of settlers moved across the river and settled {{on the bank of the}} Moshassuck River at a place which Williams named Providence Plantation.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: During bowel surgery, {{perioperative}} {{blood loss}} and hypotension {{can lead to}} transient intestinal ischemia. Recent preclinical studies reveal that the strength of intestinal anastomoses can be compromised after reperfusion. So far, this phenomenon has not been investigated in <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>days</b> of healing when wound strength is lowest. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Ischemia was induced in rats by clamping both the superior mesenteric artery and ileal branches for 30 min. Immediately after declamping, anastomoses were constructed in both terminal ileum and descending colon. The same was done in control groups after sham-ischemia. Anastomotic bursting pressure and breaking strength were measured immediately after operation (day 0) and after 1, 2, or 3 days. Anastomotic hydroxyproline content, gelatinase activity, and histology were analyzed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In ileal anastomoses, at day 1, both the breaking strength and bursting pressure were significantly (p < 0. 05) lower in the ischemic group, while at day 2, {{this was the case}} for the bursting pressure only. In the colon, the bursting pressure in the ischemic group was lower at day 1. Anastomotic hydroxyproline content remained unchanged. Increased presence of the various gelatinase activities was found in ileum only at day 0 and in colon at days 1 and 2. Histological mucosal damage was found in ischemia-reperfusion groups. CONCLUSION: Transient mesenteric ischemia can negatively affect anastomotic strength during <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>days</b> of healing, even if the tissue used for anastomotic construction looks vital...|$|R
