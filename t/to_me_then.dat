500|$|Hill {{repeatedly}} tells a {{story from}} when she was 14 years old and bouldering in Joshua Tree: she succeeded on a route when a man came over and commented how surprised he was that she could do the route because even he could not. [...] "I thought, well, why would you expect that you automatically could do it? Just because I was a small girl, was I {{not to be able}} to do it? It was a memorable experience because it occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>then</b> that other people had a different view of what I should or shouldn't be capable of doing. I think that people should just do whatever they can do or want to do. It shouldn't be a matter of if they're a man or a woman. It shouldn't be a matter of one's sex." ...|$|E
500|$|Ricki-Lee Dawn Coulter {{was born}} on 10 November 1985 in Auckland, New Zealand. Her mother Loretta Sheerin, of Māori descent, was a model. Coulter's parents {{separated}} before she was born, and she was raised by her mother. Coulter and her mother relocated to Gold Coast, Queensland when she was three months old. Coulter's father figure {{at the time was}} her grandfather Rocky. Coulter's mother gave her every chance to visit her biological father in New Zealand when she was a child. [...] "He wasn't a part of my life. I'd go over there and stay with him and his family, [...] it was just weird <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Then</b> when I got to an age where I could speak up to Mum, about six or seven, I said, 'I don't want to go; I don't like it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Rhodes {{gave him}} 48 hours {{to decide whether}} he wanted to join the new band that would [...] "rival the Pistols". Within 24 hours, Strummer agreed. Simonon later remarked, [...] "Once we had Joe on board it all started to come together." [...] Strummer {{introduced}} the band to his old school friend Pablo LaBritain, who sat in on drums during Strummer's first few rehearsals with the group. LaBritain's stint with the band {{did not last long}} (he subsequently joined 999), and Terry Chimes—whom Jones later referred to as [...] "one of the best drummers" [...] in their circle—became the band's regular drummer. In Westway to the World, Jones also says, [...] "I don't think Terry was officially hired or anything. He had just been playing with us." [...] Chimes did not take to Strummer at first: [...] "He was like twenty-two or twenty-three or something that seemed 'old' <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>then.</b> And he had these retro clothes and this croaky voice". Simonon came up with the band's name after they had briefly dubbed themselves the Weak Heartdrops and the Psychotic Negatives. He later explained the name's origin: [...] "It really came to my head when I started reading the newspapers and a word that kept recurring was the word 'clash', so I thought 'the Clash, what about that,' to the others. And they and Bernard, they went for it." ...|$|E
60|$|Saint. And <b>to</b> <b>me</b> especially. <b>Then,</b> I hope, {{you are no}} {{keeper of}} late hours.|$|R
6000|$|... "But listen <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> my friend," [...] said Ziska, {{taking a}} leaf {{out of the}} Jew's book. [...] "Only listen <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>then</b> I shall go." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{paused for}} a second in her struggles <b>to</b> regard <b>me.</b> <b>Then,</b> with a sudden contemptuous laugh, she renewed her efforts more vigorously than before.|$|R
2500|$|... "Vitality of {{mind and}} body; the {{activity}} to employ and maintain them; the zest and curiosity that they can animate; freedom to travel widely in nature and art, in {{countries of the world}} and countries of the mind; human affections; and the gift of gaiety – these seem <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>then,</b> the main causes of happiness. I am surprised to find how few and simple they are." ...|$|E
2500|$|As for his {{philosophical}} {{background in}} screenwriting and directing, Gilliam {{said on the}} TV show First Hand on RoundhouseTV, [...] "There's so many film schools, so many media courses which I actually am opposed to. Because I think it's more important to be educated, to read, to learn things, because if you're gonna be {{in the media and}} if you'll have to say things, you have to know things. If you only know about cameras and 'the media', what're you gonna be talking about except cameras and the media? So it's better learning about philosophy and art and architecture [...] literature, these are the things to be concentrating on it seems <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Then,</b> you can fly...!" ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{got a job}} on Hammerstein's Roof at $140 a {{week for}} myself, my horse, {{and the man who}} looked after it. I {{remained}} on the roof for eight weeks, always getting another two week extension when Willie Hammerstein would say to me after the Monday matinee, 'you're good for two weeks more'... Marty Shea, the booking agent for the Columbia, came to me and asked if I wanted to play burlesque. They could use an extra attraction....I told him I would think about it, but 'Burlesque' sounded <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>then</b> as something funny." [...] Shea and Sam A. Scribner, the general manager of the Columbia Amusement Company, approached Rogers a few days later. Shea told Scribner Rogers was getting $150 and would take $175. [...] "'What's he carrying?', Scribner asked Shea. 'Himself, a horse, and a man', answered Shea." [...] Scribner replied, [...] "'Give him eight weeks at $250'".|$|E
5000|$|Captain: Don't {{you ever}} {{talk that way}} <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> (pause, <b>then</b> hitting him) NEVER! NEVER! (Luke rolls down hill; to other prisoners) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I {{have been}} mistaken in you!' she cried. 'You came <b>to</b> rob <b>me,</b> <b>then,</b> and not <b>to</b> help <b>me.</b> You have the bearing of a gentleman, {{and yet you}} steal my husband's coat.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Searle {{seemed to}} have {{made an effort to}} compose himself. [...] "Be so good as <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> <b>then</b> what was the meaning of your letter." ...|$|R
2500|$|Dettori {{sent the}} colt into the lead {{soon after the}} start and set the pace from Highland Reel, Pleascach, Free Eagle and Found. Two furlongs from the finish Free Eagle made a forward move but as he {{challenged}} the favourite, Golden Horn veered to the right, hampering his challenger. Golden Horn kept on well in the closing stages to win by a length from Found, who stayed on to deprive Free Eagle of second. Following an inquiry by the racecourse stewards the result was allowed to stand. Dettori said [...] "It was a stellar field and he was showing what a good horse he is. Pat [...] came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>then</b> I gave {{him a couple of}} cracks and I got the measure of him and I thought, right, come on, let’s go home. All of a sudden, he just took a right turn. He must have seen something". Gosden offered the view that the horse had swerved because of the shadow cast across the course by the grandstand.|$|E
2500|$|When Mrs. Rodenhurst {{told me of}} {{the advent}} to Shrewsbury of Wainwright, I asked her {{if he was in}} his room, or where. 'No,' she said, 'he went out about an hour ago. I think you'll find him in the King's Arms.' I went to the King's Arms and made my very first {{appearance}} in the bar-parlour of a public-house. The room was empty save for one man, dressed in blue serge, with a shrewd lean face. I recognised him. I had seen him playing for Yorkshire at Old Trafford. I introduced myself. 'I'm the assistant pro.,' I explained. 'Art thou?' he replied, 'well, then 'ave a drink wi' me.' I told him I didn't drink — only ginger ale. 'Christ,' he said, 'tha'rt a reight bloody cricketer.' He was a tall man, who walked as though he didn't care a damn for anybody. There was something sinister about him. Every night he got drunk as a matter of course, quietly and masterfully. One day he backed a winner at a glorious price, and towards eleven o'clock that night he and the drill-sergeant of the school arrived arm-in-arm (supporting one another) in the sitting-room of our lodgings. Very gravely Ted introduced me to the drill-sergeant, whom of course I knew very well. The drill-sergeant as gravely introduced Ted <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>then</b> taking my arm, he whispered rather noisily in my ear, 'I'm 'fraid 'e's a l'il drunk, so I've jus' bror him h-home.' Whereupon Ted dissolved into helpless laughter and said, 'My dear sersergeant, don't be 'diculous[...] [...] [...] Bror me home? Why, you ole fool, it's me that's bror you 'ome.' Then (aside), 'E's jus' a l'il drunk, so I've bror him home.' The sergeant hooted with glee. 'Bless m' soul,' he said, 'Ted; jus' lis'en t'me. If you'd bror me home, this would be my lodgin's, see? I would be 'ome, not you. See? But this is your lodgin's—so I mus' 'ave bror you 'ome. See?' ...|$|E
60|$|It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>then</b> that I {{would rather}} be a hero of a French duel than a crowned and sceptered monarch.|$|E
60|$|She {{explained}} {{the whole thing}} <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>then</b> she asked if I wouldn't intercede with you. I promised to do everything I could.|$|R
6000|$|But Strether could reassure her. [...] "Don't fear. As {{soon as he}} {{has done}} with Jim, Jim will fall <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> And <b>then</b> you'll see." ...|$|R
60|$|More {{than thirty}} years ago you tried <b>to</b> protect <b>me,</b> <b>then</b> a {{stranger}} <b>to</b> you, {{from one of the}} falsest and most malignant accusations ever made against a writer.|$|R
60|$|Not {{until we}} had reached the Castle and were in the library did my father speak <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Then</b> his words were grave enough.|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen well <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>then,</b> Mr. Sterne: I wouldn't--d'ye hear?--I wouldn't {{promise you}} {{the value of}} two pence for {{anything}} you can tell me." ...|$|E
60|$|I note {{without comment}} that it didn't even occur <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>then</b> {{to wake him}} up and ask him what HE was up to with mankind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Somebody {{introduced}} her <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>then</b> I {{had to walk}} about the grounds with her. That's {{the kind of thing}} one always does in those places." ...|$|R
60|$|I let 'im give 'em <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>then,</b> just <b>to</b> please 'im, I let 'im try {{the collar}} on 'is dog, while I swept up a bit.|$|R
6000|$|Lord John {{was delighted}} with the whole idea. [...] "Clever old dear, ain't he?" [...] he whispered <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>then</b> louder <b>to</b> Challenger. [...] "What about a car?" ...|$|R
60|$|Surprised, and {{a little}} uncomfortable at this {{evidence}} of intuition, I started to protest. It seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>then</b> as though I had always wanted her.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>then,</b> {{that you ought}} to force her out of that kind of thing. Why should she not go down to Herefordshire?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell {{him to come}} <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>then.</b> I {{should want}} him every day, if he could manage it, {{and it would be}} the very thing for me." ...|$|E
60|$|MAZZINI [looking forlornly at the body]. What is your {{objection}} to poor Mangan, Mrs Hushabye? He looks all right <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But <b>then</b> I am {{so accustomed to}} him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} fairly, Laura, {{as far as}} I am concerned, I never could speak to him. He is antipathetic <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But <b>then</b> I am not his wife." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{continued}} <b>to</b> {{stare at}} <b>me.</b> <b>Then</b> a sudden flash of intelligence lit up his features.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{you propose}} <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>then,</b> is to {{accompany}} you tout bonnement {{to your new}} post. What you propose to me is {{to pack up and}} start?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, O my king," [...] the Lady Om mumbled low <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>then</b> {{turned to}} whine an alms of Chong Mong-ju, whom she {{affected}} not to recognize.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--in {{my dream}} again, {{the same one}} I've named to you. He came back <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Then</b> I knew it for a sign. He had come to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Think of {{what his}} conduct has been <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> And <b>then</b> you tell <b>me</b> that I am to own that I have been wrong! In what have I been wrong?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I suffer enough, Olaf. So {{much that}} I shall {{be glad to}} die. But {{if you are not}} come <b>to</b> kill <b>me,</b> <b>then</b> it is that you may scourge me with your tongue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beastly mean way {{of getting}} 'em," [...] {{retorted}} Dan. And no argument that came <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> neither <b>then</b> nor at any future time, brought him to right thinking on this point.|$|R
