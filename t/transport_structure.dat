A light rail link to Gosport was authorised in 2002 with completion expected in 2005, but it is unlikely that the project will be completed following the refusal of funding by the Department for Transport in November 2005. In April 2011, an article appeared in Portsmouth News suggesting a new scheme could be in the offing by running a light rapid transit system over the line to Southampton via Fareham, Bursledon, and Sholing, thus replacing the existing heavy rail services.|$|E

40|$|Lagrangian <b>transport</b> <b>structures</b> for {{three-dimensional}} and time-dependent fluid flows are {{of great}} interest in numerous applications, particularly for geophysical or oceanic flows. In such flows, chaotic transport and mixing can play important environmental and ecological roles, for examples in pollution spills or plankton migration. In such flows, where simulations or observations are typically available only over a short time, understanding the difference between short-time and long-time <b>transport</b> <b>structures</b> is critical. In this paper, we use a set of classical (i. e. Poincaré section, Lyapunov exponent) and alternative (i. e. finite time Lyapunov exponent, Lagrangian coherent structures) tools from dynamical systems theory that analyze chaotic transport both qualitatively and quantitatively. With this set of tools {{we are able to}} reveal, identify and highlight differences between short- and long-time <b>transport</b> <b>structures</b> inside a flow composed of a primary horizontal contra-rotating vortex chain, small lateral oscillations and a weak Ekman pumping. The difference is mainly the existence of regular or extremely slowly developing chaotic regions that are only present at short time. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

These loads are used as inputs into stress analyses, which may be either quasi-static or dynamic, and either in the time domain or in the frequency domain.

40|$|The National Ignition Facility is a {{laser fusion}} project {{that will provide}} an {{above-ground}} experimental capability for nuclear weapons effects simulation. This facility will achieve fusion ignition utilizing solid-state lasers as the energy driver. The facility will cover an estimated 33, 400 m{sup 2 } at an average height of 5 [...] 6 stories. Within this complex, a number of beam <b>transport</b> <b>structures</b> will be houses that will deliver the laser beams to the target area within a 50 {micro}m ms radius of the target center. The beam <b>transport</b> <b>structures</b> are approximately 23 m long and reach approximately heights of 2 [...] 3 stories. Low-level ambient random vibrations {{are one of the}} primary concerns currently controlling the design of these structures. Low level ambient vibrations, 10 {sup {minus} 10 } g{sup 2 }/Hz over a frequency range of 1 to 200 Hz, are assumed to be present during all facility operations. Each structure described in this paper will be required to achieve and maintain 0. 6 {micro}rad ms laser beam pointing stability for a minimum of 2 hours under these vibration levels. To date, finite element (FE) analysis has been performed on a number of the beam <b>transport</b> <b>structures.</b> Certain assumptions have to be made regarding structural uncertainties in the FE models. These uncertainties consist of damping values for concrete and steel, compliance within bolted and welded joints, and assumptions regarding the phase coherence of ground motion components.

A pallet is the structural foundation of a unit load which allows handling and storage efficiencies.

Since its invention in the twentieth century, its use has dramatically supplanted older forms of crating like the wooden box and the wooden barrel, as it works well with modern packaging like corrugated boxes and Intermodal containers commonly used for bulk shipping.|$|E
