At the time, it was unknown if it would be a one-off or if a longer relationship would start. An insider from EastEnders told Inside Soap that Roxy and AJ are both looking for fun and they [...] "hit it off" [...] because she loves [...] "a man who can make her laugh and AJ definitely ticks that box." [...] They added that they have [...] "great chemistry" [...] but said that as Roxy is sidetracked by another man, [...] "AJ will have to fight [...] for her affections" [...] if he wants her. An insider also told the Daily Star that the two [...] "can't keep their hands off each other" [...] and [...] "Roxy is more than up for it." [...] They added that [...] "Zainab would go mental if she knew what they were up to under her roof and {{it remains to be seen}} whether <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it. Roxy is the last person who Zainab would want AJ to hook up with. [...] Even Masood could not defend his brother this time as he had been pretty disrespectful." [...] Digital Spy also noted chemistry between AJ and Roxy, saying they [...] "clearly enjoy each other's company". Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror said the relationship between Roxy and AJ is [...] "played for laughs", contrasting with Roxy's relationship with Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd).|$|E
2500|$|In Rope, Granger and John Dall portrayed two {{intellectuals who}} commit a murder simply to prove <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it. The two {{characters}} and their former professor, played by Jimmy Stewart, {{were supposed to}} be homosexual, and Granger and Dall discussed the subtext of their scenes. Because The Hays Office was keeping close tabs on the project, however, the final script was so discreet that Laurents remained uncertain of whether Stewart ever realized that his own character was homosexual. Hitchcock shot the film in continuous, uninterrupted 10-minute takes, the amount of time a reel of Technicolor film lasted, and, as a result, technical problems frequently brought the action to a frustrating halt throughout the 21-day shoot. The film ultimately received mixed reviews, although most critics were impressed by Granger, who in later years said he was happy {{to be part of the}} experience, but wondered [...] "what the film would have been like had [...] shot it normally" [...] and [...] "had he not had to worry about censorship." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{dropping}} out of Carnegie Tech in early 1963, he relocated to Los Angeles {{with the intent of}} being involved with the growing West Coast beatnik subculture and to play with his older brother Carson Parks as the Steeltown Two (later enlarged to three), which eventually became the folk group the Greenwood County Singers. The group included future RCA Records producer and recording artist Rick Jarrard. Parks later said of this decision, [...] "Going to California meant I escaped John Cage. I escaped the abstractions, the music you can't remember, the highbrow angst." [...] The two Parks brothers performed together at various coffeehouses around San Diego, Santa Barbara, and San Francisco. One of the people in attendance at a Santa Barbara performance turned out to be future Byrds member David Crosby, who at the time remarked to friend David Lindley, [...] "If <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it, so can we." [...] While in California, Parks attempted to land a job performing on the television show Art Linkletter's House Party but was not accepted. Parks took a short hiatus from this group, briefly moving to New England {{to be part of the}} Brandywine Singers, earning up to $3,000 a week.|$|E

2500|$|Dawkins expresses {{concern about}} {{increasing}} religious influence in British schools with over 7,000 faith schools already {{and the government}} encouraging more, so {{over half of the}} new City Academies are expected to be sponsored by religious organizations. He says that the most worrying development is a new wave of private Evangelical schools that have adopted [...] the American Baptist Accelerated Christian Education curriculum, and as an example calls on Phoenix Academy in London. Dawkins is shown around the school by head teacher Adrian Hawkes and remarks on how the teaching material appears to mention God or Jesus on almost every page; such as a reference to Noah's Ark in a science textbook. Hawkes responds by saying that the stories could {{have a lot to do}} with science if you believe in them, and that the science he was taught at school is laughable today. As an example, he mentions that he was taught that the moon came from the Earth's ocean and was [...] "somehow flung out into space" [...] during the early years of the Earth's life. Dawkins says that it should have been presented as a strong current theory. Another lesson talks about AIDS as being the [...] "wages of sin", so Dawkins inquires whether this might not be mixing health education with moralistic preaching. Hawkes responds that without a law-giver, [...] "Why is rape wrong? Why is pedophilia wrong?" [...] and that if people believe <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> committing bad deeds then they will tend to do them. Dawkins responds to this claim by asking Hawkes if the only reason he doesn't do these things is that he's frightened of God and subsequently suggests that this attitude is characteristic of the warped morality that religion tends to instill in people.|$|E

50|$|Wall spider is {{the common}} name {{for members of the}} genus Oecobius. The members of these several species are all very small spiders that make small flat webs over crevices in walls and in similar spaces.

5000|$|A 2007 {{study by}} Dr. Amin Muhammad and Dr. Sujay Patel of Memorial University, Canada, {{investigated}} how {{the practice of}} honor killings has been brought to Canada.

[...] The report noted that [...] "In different cultures, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> without being punished—the courts actually sanction them under religious contexts". The report {{also said that the}} people who commit these crimes are usually mentally ill, and that the mental health aspect is often ignored by Western observers {{because of a lack of}} understanding of the insufficiently developed state of mental healthcare in developing countries in which honor killings are prevalent.|$|R

50|$|Every {{successful}} {{leader and}} organization knows {{that in order}} to maximize profits, it's absolutely imperative to hire and keep the best employees possible. If a business is always looking to maximize profit, it’ll be actively vested in trying to reduce expenses whenever possible—including (alas) employees’ wages. The truth is that most companies pay employees as little as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with.</b> Which is perfect if you want a workforce who will, in turn, provide as little effort as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with.</b> Many companies are still rocking this archaic, backward thinking about compensation. While it seems like it may be cost effective to apply this profit-first mentality of low-as-possible wages, it ultimately cripples employee performance, engagement, and damages your bottom line.|$|E
50|$|A slumlord (or slum landlord) is a {{derogatory}} {{term for}} a landlord, generally an absentee landlord {{with more than one}} property, who attempts to maximize profit by minimizing spending on property maintenance, often in deteriorating neighborhoods.

40|$|Hierarchical linear and {{generalized}} {{linear models}} can be fit using Gibbs samplers and Metropolis algorithms; these models, however, often have many parameters, and convergence of the seemingly most natural Gibbs and Metropolis algorithms {{can sometimes be}} slow. We examine solutions that involve reparameterization and over-parameterization. We begin with parameter expansion using working parameters, a strategy developed for the EM algorithm by Meng and van Dyk (1997) and Liu, Rubin, and Wu (1998). This strategy can lead to algorithms that are much less susceptible to becoming stuck near zero values of the variance parameters than are more standard algorithms. Second, we consider a simple rotation of the regression coefficients based on an estimate of their posterior covariance matrix. This leads to a Gibbs algorithm based on updating the transformed parameters {{one at a time}} or a Metropolis algorithm with vector jumps; either of these algorithms can perform much better (in terms of total CPU time) than the two standard algorithms: one-at-a-time updating of untransformed parameters or vector updating using a linear regression at each step. We present an innovative evaluation of the algorithms in terms of how quickly <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from remote areas of parameter space, along with some more standard evaluation of computation and convergence speeds. We illustrate our methods with examples from our applied work. Our ultimate goal is to develop a fast and reliable method for fitting a hierarchical linear model as easily as one can now fit a non-hierarchical model, and to increase understanding of Gibbs samplers for hierarchical models in general.
