5|$|Due to {{the number}} of GPUs in the system, its initial boot was unsuccessful. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> its {{motherboard}} uses a 32 bit BIOS, which only had approximately 3 GB of address space for the video cards. However, Asus managed to provide them a specialized BIOS that entirely skipped the address space allocation of the GTX 295 video cards. The BIOS-replacement coreboot was not tested.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013, Milian {{became a}} {{contestant}} on Dancing with the Stars (season 17). She was partnered with professional dancer Mark Ballas. She was eliminated in week five despite receiving the highest {{score of the}} night. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> the elimination {{was based on the}} previous week's score (24) and viewer votes.|$|E

5|$|Lamarck's {{evolutionary}} theory made little immediate {{impact on his}} fellow zoologists, or on the public at the time. The historian of science Richard Burkhardt argues that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> Lamarck was convinced his views would be poorly received, and made little effort to present his theory persuasively.|$|E
5|$|Ofotbanen {{lost their}} license from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate on 7 October 2008 at 12:00. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> Ofotbanen had not {{documented}} necessary accounting for 2007, nor provided evidence of necessary liquidity.

5|$|A 2005 {{survey found}} that 68% of American flex-fuel car owners were not aware they owned an E85 flex. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> the exteriors of flex and non-flex {{vehicles}} look exactly the same; there is no sale price difference between them; the lack of consumers' awareness about E85s; and also the initial decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling, so buyers could be unaware they are purchasing an E85 vehicle. Since 2008, all new FFV models in the US feature a bright yellow gas cap to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities and proper flex-fuel badging.|$|E

5|$|A {{decision}} by the US Army in the mid-2000s to replace all of its CH-47Ds with new-build CH-47Fs by 2017 endangered {{the viability of the}} Australian Chinooks. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> the Australian Army's arrangements for the logistical support of its small fleet of CH-47Ds were heavily leveraged off those for the US Army's large fleet. In response, the Australian Army also established a project to acquire CH-47F Chinooks to replace its CH-47Ds in the mid-2000s. The Australian Government provided initial approval for a CH-47F purchase in September 2007. As part of this decision, the Government chose to procure the helicopters through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales program to minimise potential risks to the schedule and cost of the project.|$|E
5|$|After {{developing}} Gunstar Heroes, Treasure {{was divided}} into four teams to work on four separate projects: Alien Soldier, Light Crusader, , and Dynamite Headdy. Masato Maegawa, president of Treasure, served as head programmer on Dynamite Headdy. After deciding to publish a localized version for overseas markets, Maegawa was told by Sega of America to make the game more difficult. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> Sega did not want customers completing the game too easily on rental. Maegawa happily obliged, and the North American release was made about twice as difficult. In addition to changes in difficulty, most of the dialogue in the game was removed, {{and several of the}} character and boss sprites were changed.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{supporting}} roles, {{one of the}} highest-profile pieces of casting was Malcolm McDowell as Soho porn baron Benny Barrett. Barrett appears in scenes across various episodes from 1966 through to 1979, but the production could only afford him for three weeks. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> McDowell was then a resident in the United States. All of McDowell's scenes were therefore shot by Stuart Urban {{as part of the}} first block of filming, as opposed {{to the rest of the}} production which was filmed roughly chronologically. This was considered more than worthwhile, however, for the prestige of being able to use an actor such as McDowell, predominantly a film actor who rarely did television work.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} his Thracian campaign, Philip moved {{against the}} city of Perinthos, {{formerly}} his ally. Diodorus says that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> the city had begun to oppose him, and favour the Athenians; however, from Athenian sources, {{there is no indication that}} this was the case. One possible explanation is that Perinthos had refused to send aid to Philip during the Thracian campaign, and it was for this reason he decided to attack it. Either way, since Perinthos was a Greek city, Philip's actions gave the Athenian war-party the excuse it had been looking for to disrupt the peace Philip had wrought in Greece, thereby starting a new phase in the wars.|$|E
5|$|Average wage {{rates in}} the Soviet Union were {{published}} relatively rarely. Some academics in the West believed <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> the Soviet government wanted to conceal low average earnings. Alec Nove wrote in 1966 (when wage statistics were published {{for the first time}} since the Second World War) that the lack of transparency surrounding average wages was intended to prevent Soviet workers from discovering the huge disparities that existed between wages in different sectors of the Soviet economy.|$|E
5|$|Bai Ling filmed minor scenes for {{the film}} playing a senator, but her role was cut during editing. She claimed <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> she posed for the June 2005 issue of Playboy, whose {{appearance}} on newsstands coincided with the film's May release. Lucas denied this, stating that the cut had been made {{more than a year}} earlier, and that he had cut his own daughter's scenes as well.|$|E
50|$|ARY Digital UAE is also free to air, but the {{programming}} {{is limited to}} Pakistani programmes only, this includes ARY Digital's exclusive Dramas and TV shows, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> UAE's local Channels own the rights for American and English shows and films.

5|$|Between 1998â€“2001, Melbourne was {{the only}} club to display player names {{on the back of}} jerseys. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> there was no major sponsor for the Storm to display on the chest or back at the time and in {{addition}} it helped supporters new to the game identify the players. In 2001, Melbourne gained its first major sponsor in Adecco, and was displayed on the jersey chest, while maintaining the players names on the back until the end of 2001. In 2002, the Storm removed the player's names and displayed Adecco's logo on the back. Since then the Storm have had varying sponsors adorning the Jersey.|$|E

Only a few shots of him remain in the film, which is where the team first enters the alien hive, only his back is seen. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> those sequences were too expensive to re-shoot.|$|E
