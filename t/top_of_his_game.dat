25|$|With his {{effectiveness}} {{hindered by}} {{the necessity of}} pitching two days in a row, the Browns found themselves on their heels quickly when ace Bob Caruthers walked four of the first five batters, surrendering a second run on a base hit given up to third baseman Tom Burns of the Chicagos. The game was called after completion of eight innings due to darkness. John Clarkson was again on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game</b> as the right hander struck out 8 Browns in earning his second win of the series.

However, once the {{determined}} Tiger Mask recovered, he regained his NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship by defeating Kuniaki Kobayashi on June 2, 1983, making him a simultaneous NWA/WWF Jr. champion for the second time. By 1983, however, Sayama started feeling dissatisfied as he hated the politics behind-the-scenes. As a result, he announced his retirement from active competition on August 12, 1983. It was a shock to the wrestling world, as Tiger Mask was going to retire while he was at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game</b> and as the holder of two Junior Heavyweight Championships. Both titles were declared vacant, as he became a trainer to martial arts fighters.|$|E

50|$|As Mark McCall recalls {{while he}} takes a {{breather}} from a high-paced training session with his stellar Saracens squad, it {{was a mixture of}} happenstance and destiny that brought him into coaching.

25|$|Martínez {{started the}} 2006 {{season at the}} <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game.</b> At the end of May, he was 5–1 with a 2.50 ERA, with 88 strikeouts and 17 walks and 44 hits allowed in 76 innings; Martínez's record was worse than it could have been, with the Mets bullpen costing him two victories. However, during his May 26 start against the Florida Marlins, Martínez was {{instructed}} by the umpires to change his undershirt. He slipped in the corridor, injuring his hip, and his promising season curdled. The effect was not immediately apparent; although Martínez lost the Marlins game, his following start was a scintillating 0–0 duel with Arizona's Brandon Webb. But after that, beginning on June 6, Martínez went 4–7 with a 7.10 ERA {{in a series of}} spotty starts interrupted twice by stays on the disabled list. A right calf injury plagued him for the last two months of the season. After Martínez was removed from an ineffective September 15 outing, television cameras found him in the Mets dugout, apparently crying. Subsequent MRI exams revealed a torn muscle in Martínez's left calf, and a torn rotator cuff. Martínez underwent surgery which sidelined him for most of the 2007 season.|$|E

Reviewing Tempest for Rolling Stone, Will Hermes gave the album five out of five stars, writing: [...] "Lyrically, Dylan is at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game,</b> joking around, dropping wordplay and allegories that evade pat readings and quoting other folks' words like a freestyle rapper on fire." [...] Hermes called Tempest [...] "one of [...] weirdest albums ever", and opined, [...] "It may also be the single darkest record in Dylan's catalog."

As team captain at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, he was noted for helping his teammates understand everything that was going on around them. His athleticism and personal courage have been praised by those who know him, such as Michael Page, chef d’equipe for the 1986 US World Championship team, who recounted how Plumb medaled at the competition despite three broken ribs. Plumb admits to being completely focused on riding and [...] "not a social person", with former coach Jack le Goff saying that [...] "horses are his only reason for being on earth".|$|E

5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for The Crossover has been positive. According to Kirkus Reviews, [...] "Poet Alexander deftly reveals {{the power of}} the format to pack an emotional punch." [...] In Booklist, Gail Bush called The Crossover [...] "a rare verse novel that is fundamentally poetic rather than using this writing trend as a device." [...] Writing for the Washington Post, Mary Quattlebaum said Alexander was [...] "at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> poetic <b>game</b> in this taut, complex tale of the crossover from brash, vulnerable boy to young adult." [...] Poet Cornelius Eady wrote in The New York Times, [...] "The biggest surprise of 'The Crossover' is that, for all the bells and whistles of a young man's game, it is most boldly and certainly a book about tenderness." [...] According to Katrina Hedeen in The Horn Book Magazine, [...] "Alexander brings the novel-in-verse format to a fresh audience with this massively appealing package for reluctant readers, athletes especially." [...] Writing for School Library Journal, Kiera Parrott said, [...] "Alexander has crafted a story that vibrates with energy and heart and begs to be read aloud. A slam dunk." ...|$|R

Only someone who has showed death the door can open windows to life like this." [...] Filmfare gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "Barfi! is that rare film that can make you smile and make you cry in the same scene. Its technical brilliance is only outdone by its emotional complexity and depth. Pritam's music adds a nice silent-era charm to this already fantastic story, making it an occasion when words simply aren’t enough." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com has given 3.5/5 stars and wrote, [...] "Barfi! is a well-crafted script with an intriguing back-and-forth narrative but it all goes south towards the end." ...|$|E
500|$|Starting from January 1909, the ATC sought {{authorization}} {{from baseball}} players {{for inclusion in}} the T206 series, which would feature 524 major league players, 76 of whom would later be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Wagner had been at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game</b> throughout the decade, and was even considered to be the game's greatest player at the time. He had appeared on advertisements for a number of other products such as chewing gum, gunpowder and soft drinks. Unsurprisingly, the ATC asked for Wagner's permission to have his picture on a baseball card. According to an October 12, 1912, issue of The Sporting News, Wagner did not give his consent to appear on the baseball card. In response to the authorization request letter sent by John Gruber, a Pittsburgh sportswriter hired by the ATC to seek Wagner's permission, Wagner wrote that he [...] "did not care to have his picture in a package of cigarettes." [...] He threatened to seek legal action against ATC if they went ahead and created his baseball card.|$|E
500|$|Recording of Satisfied {{began in}} September 2007 at Southern Tracks Recording in Atlanta, Georgia.

There's {{a lot of excitement}} and passion that comes from his end.... big thing for us is having a really good time. [...] If we're not having a good time making a record, it's gonna show and you're gonna hear it." [...] To capture the excitement of their live shows, DecembeRadio recorded basic tracks live in the studio. [...] Reedy said recording live is particularly useful for capturing energetic performances from drummer Boone Daughdrill. [...] "It's definitely very critical for him to be on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game</b> and feeling like it's a unit, because you play off of each other. [...] It's a real push and pull thing that happens in rock and roll music that you really can't sometimes capture by just doing it track by track by track", said Reedy. [...] Miker said the band recorded a handful of songs that were [...] "out of the box of where CCM music is", and Reedy noted that some tracks [...] "stretched what we're doing ... with production." [...] "Gasoline", for example, includes a [...] "Beatlesque" [...] section with a children's choir, string section and piccolo trumpet, and [...] "Falling for You" [...] begins and ends with some guitar [...] "shred licks" [...] that started as a joke in the writing process.|$|E

L'Express thought Almodóvar had returned to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game</b> with Julieta, calling it [...] "a work constantly on the edge, never overwhelmed by its own emotions, deliberately cold [...] even austere". Libération gave a positive review, but felt the film was [...] "too well-oiled" [...] which prevented the drama of the story from [...] "truly expressing all its power of emotional attraction".
