40|$|<b>Travelling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> (TID) is a {{phenomenon}} caused by solar activity and TID strength varies by locations, especially in equatorial regions. This phenomenon affects the local total electron content (TEC), especially during the daytime. Because of this, research regarding augmenting TEC values during TID is done by comparing TEC values obtained from the IRI 2001 and NeQuick models with IONEX data. By using Global Positioning System (GPS) data obtained from the Parit Raja station {{in the southern part}} of Malaysia (1 º 52 ’ N, 103 º 06 ’ E) as reference, research was conducted during geomagnetic quiet day as well as on the disturbed day. The occurrence of TID can clearly be seen when using the real TEC data from IONEX and WARAS. Result obtained from Parit Raja station shows a much more significant effect of TID occurrence on TEC than what was shown by IONEX data. However, the TEC values obtained from the IRI 2001 and NeQuick models were influenced by the number of sunspots and were only applicable in geomagnetic quiet days. In order to obtain more accurate TEC values, it is necessary to ensure that TID condition is included in the IRI 2001 and NeQuick model...|$|E

40|$|<b>Travelling</b> <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Disturbances</b> (TIDs) {{are said}} to be {{produced}} by atmospheric gravitational waves propagating through the neutral ionosphere. These are smaller in amplitude and period when compared to most <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> and hence more difficult to measure. Very {{little is known about the}} properties of the <b>travelling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> (TIDs) over the Southern Hemisphere regions since studies have been conducted mostly over the Northern Hemisphere regions. This study presents a framework, using a High Frequency (HF) Doppler radar to investigate the physical properties and the possible driving mechanisms of TIDs. This research focuses on studying the characteristics of the TIDs, such as period, velocity and temporal variations, using HF Doppler measurements taken in South Africa. By making use of a Wavelet Analysis technique, the TIDs’ characteristics were determined. A statistical summary on speed and direction of propagation of the observed TIDs was performed. The winter medium scale <b>travelling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> (MSTIDs) observed are generally faster than the summer MSTIDs. For all seasons, the MSTIDs had a preferred south-southwest direction of propagation. Most of the large scale <b>travelling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> (LSTIDs) were observed during the night and of these, the spring LSTIDs were fastest when compared to autumn and summer LSTIDs. The general direction of travel of the observed LSTIDs is south-southeast. Total Electron Content (TEC), derived from Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements, were used to validate some of the TID results obtained from the HF Doppler data. The Horizontal Wind Model (HWM 07), magnetic K index, and solar terminators were used to determine the possible sources of the observed TIDs. Only 41 % of the observed TIDs were successfully linked to their possible sources of excitation. The information gathered from this study will be valuable in future radio communications and will serve as means to improve the existing ionospheric models over the South African region...|$|R

40|$|A Fast-Fourier-Transform {{method has}} been used to {{calculate}} a series of one-dimensional ground diffraction patterns which arise from point-source illumination of a moving sinusoidal reflector. Correlation analysis was performed on the set of ground patterns to investigate the relationship between the derived pattern drift velocity and random velocity, and the velocity of the moving reflector. Application of the correlation analysis of Briggs, Phillips and Shinn (1950) to the complex temporal correlations of the ground patterns between spaced receivers gave a true velocity value which agreed with that of the reflector. The derived random velocity was negligible, as desired for a correct description of unchanging reflector shape. The true velocity obtained from the spatial amplitude correlations using the spatial correlation method of Briggs (1968 a) was found to agree closely with the ground velocity of the single specular reflection point on the sinusoidal surface. An undesirable feature was a high value of estimated random velocity. The amplitude temporal correlations and complex spatial correlations gave no useful information. Synoptic ionograms taken at 15 -minute intervals at Christchurch, New Zealand, indicated the presence of a medium-scale <b>travelling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> on 19 th February, 1978. The phase velocity vфh = 117 (± 10) m. sec-¹, horizontal wavelength λh = 560 (± 90) km, and period T = 80 - 90 minutes. Phase-path data for an altitude of 200 km on the same day show a series of harmonics of a 90 -minute fundamental in their maximum entropy power spectra. The harmonics of the phase range arose from movement of a specular reflecting point on a quasi-sinusoidal surface. The existence of several wave cycles of similar frequency in the data and the presence of moderately high magnetic activity allows the auroral electrojet as a possible source for the disturbance observed.

40|$|We used bottomside ground {{observations}} and topside sounding {{data from the}} Intercosmos- 19 satellite to study a <b>Travelling</b> <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Disturbance</b> (TID) that occurred in response to Large-Scale Internal Gravity Wave (LSIGW) propagation during a substorm on November 30, 1979. We built a global scheme for the wavelike ionospheric variations during this medium substorm (AEmax 800 nT). The area where the TID was observed looks like a wedge since it covers the nighttime hours at subauroral latitudes but contracts to a 02 h local sector at low latitudes. The ionospheric response is strongly asymmetric because the wedge area and the TID amplitude are larger in the winter hemisphere than in the summer hemisphere. Clear evidence was obtained indicating that the more powerful TID from the Northern (winter) hemisphere propagated across the equator into the low latitude Southern (summer) hemisphere. Intercosmos- 19 observations show that the disturbance covers the entire thickness of the topside ionosphere, from hmF 2 up to at least the 1000 km satellite altitude at post-midnight local times. F-layer lifting reached 200 km, Ne increases in the topside ionosphere by up to a factor of 1. 9 and variations in NmF 2 of both signs were observed. Assumptions are made concerning {{the reason for the}} IGW effect at high altitudes in the topside ionosphere. The relationship between TID parameters and source characteristics determined from a global network of magnetometers are studied. The role of the dayside cusp in the generation of the TID in the daytime ionosphere is discussed. The magnetospheric electric field effects are distinguished from IGW effects. Research Highlights The global scheme for the large-scale TID propagation during a substorm is built. TID covers the entire thickness of the topside ionosphere.

40|$|We {{intend to}} present {{results of a}} study where precise ionospheric {{corrections}} have been generated and then used to assist Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning with data from high-end single-frequency receivers. The data used in the tests were from CORSnet-NSW (Australia) and from the NGS CORS (USA). The motivation has been twofold: (a) to use new techniques for estimating corrections for the ionospheric delay in L 1, with moderate levels of scintillation and <b>travelling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> (TID), and test them in single-frequency positioning solutions; (b) {{to help make the}} most of good L 1 -only receivers that can be considerably less expensive than dual-frequency ones. The emphasis is on wide-area L 1 -only applications, such as point positioning, supported by a sparse CORS-type network where the stations are separated by distances of up to several hundred kilometres. In order to maximise the accuracy and consistency of the ionospheric corrections for single-frequency precise GNSS users, the following approach will be considered: the TOMION tomographic model of the ionospheric electron content, which simultaneously solve the main model unknown parameters in a wide area GNSS network (like carrier phase ambiguities and zenith tropospheric delays). This will be adopted in order to provide the main “lineal” ionospheric corrections to the users (following e. g. Colombo O. L., Hernandez-Pajares M., Juan J. M. & Sanz J. (2002) Wide-area, carrier-phase ambiguity resolution using a tomographic model of the ionosphere, Navigation, 49 (1), 61 - 69). Moreover, the potential benefits for single-frequency precise GNSS users of adapting existing models of the predominant ionospheric waves (the Medium Scale Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances, MSTIDs) will be specifically assessed in this work taking into account recent findings (Hernandez-Pajares M., Wielgosz P., Paziewski J., Krypiak-Gregorczyk A., Stepniak K., Bosy J., Kaplon J., Hadas T., Orus-Perez R., Monte-Moreno E., Yang H., Garcia-Rigo A. & Olivares-Pulido G.

40|$|Initially, {{this paper}} {{considers}} earlier experimental results (some of them hitherto unpublished) obtained by making observations on signals returning from mid-latitude spread-F irregularities. These results suggest associations between spread-F irregularities and nighttime <b>travelling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Statistical analyses are then described which investigate the spread-F phenomenon {{at a number}} of mid-latitude stations with approximately the same latitudes but distributed over a range of longitudes. An east-west movement of spread-F irregularities is revealed when the occurrence at these stations is considered relative to days of enhanced occurrence at a particular station. All the experimental evidence presented in the paper supports the idea that the appearance of mid-latitude spread-F ionograms results primarily from specular reflections from relatively-large-scale structures which can be imagined as being in fact nighttime <b>travelling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances.</b> These are, in turn, possibly related to internal gravity waves in the neutral atmosphere. It is suggested that the small-scale ionospheric structures (which are undoubtedly also present) are effective in inhibiting some of the specular reflections thus contributing to the diffuse nature of some records. This idea is quite contrary to the generally-accepted view that the spread-F traces are a direct consequence of scattering from these small-scale structures...|$|R
40|$|The use of High-Frequency (HF) radio-wave {{propagation}} in the ionosphere remains prevalent {{for applications}} such as long-range communication, target detection and commercial broadcasting. The ionosphere presents a challenging channel for radio-wave propagation {{as it is a}} varying medium dependent on a number of external factors. Of the many adverse effects of ionospheric propagation, signal fading {{is one of the most}} difficult to eliminate due to its unpredictable nature. Increase in the knowledge of how the ionospheric channel affects the propagating signals, in particular fading of the signals, will drive the continual improvements in the reliability and performance of modern wide-bandwidth HF systems. This is the underlying motivation for the study of signal fading of HF radio-waves propagating through the ionosphere, from both the theoretical and experimental perspectives, with the focus of application to modern wide bandwidth HF systems. Furthermore, it is the main objective of this investigation to address the lacking in the current literature of a simple analytical signal fading model for wideband HF systems that relates the physics of the ionospheric irregularities to the observable propagation effects due to the irregularities, and one that is verified by experimental observations. An original approach was taken in the theoretical investigation to develop an analytical model that combines the effects of signal fading and directly relating them to the ionospheric irregularities that are causing the fading. The polarisation fading model (PFM) is a combination of geometric optics, perturbation techniques and frequency offset techniques to derive expressions for the Faraday rotation of the radio-wave propagating in the ionosphere. Using the same notation as the PFM, the amplitude fading model (AFM) extends the Complex Amplitude concept using perturbation techniques and Green’s functions solution to arrive at a set of expressions that describes the focussing and defocussing effects of the wave. The PFM and AFM, together with expressions for combining the effects of multiple propagation paths, provide a simple analytic model that completely describes the fading of the signal propagating in the ionosphere. This theoretical model was implemented into an efficient ionospheric propagation simulator (IPS) from which simulations of wide bandwidth HF signals propagating through the ionosphere can be undertaken. As an example of the type of results produced by the IPS, for a typical 1200 km path in the north-south direction with the ionospheric channel under the influence of a <b>travelling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> (TID), a 10 MHz radio-wave signal in one-hop path is shown to be affected by polarisation fading with fading periods in the order of minutes, and a fading bandwidth in the order of 100 kHz. Further results generated by the IPS have shown to be consistent with the results reported elsewhere in the literature. The experimental investigation involves the study of signal fading from observations of real signals propagating in the ionosphere, a major part of which is the development of a digital compact channel probe (CCP) capable of operating in dual-polarisation mode, and the characterisation of such systems to ensure that data collected are not compromised by the non-idealities of the individual devices contained within the system. The CCP was deployed in experiments to collect transmissions of HF frequency-modulated continuouswave (FMCW) radio signals from the Jindalee Over-the-Horizon radar (OTHR) in dualpolarisation. Analyses of the collected data showed the full anatomy of fading of signals propagating in the ionosphere for both horizontal and vertical polarisations, the results of which are consistent with that from the IPS and thus verifying the validity of the theoretical model of fading. Further experimental results showed that in majority of the observations polarisation fading is present but can be masked by multi-path fading, and confirming that periods of rapid signal fading are associated with rapid changes in the ionospheric channel. From the theoretical and experimental investigations, the major achievement is the successful development of an efficient propagation simulator IPS based on the simple analytical expressions derived in the PFM and AFM theoretical models of signal fading, which has produced sensible signal fading results that are verified by experimental observations. One of the many outcomes of this investigation is that polarisation diversity has the potential to bring improvements to the quality of wide-bandwidth HF signals in a fading susceptible propagation channel. The combination of an efficient propagation simulator IPS based on theoretical signal fading model and the experimental data collection by the dual-polarisation CCP is a major step in allowing one to fully understand the different aspects of fading of signals propagating in the ionosphere, which sets a solid foundation for further research into the design of wide bandwidth HF systems and the possible fading mitigation techniques.

40|$|The {{times of}} onset of {{geomagnetic}} substorm activity at College, Alaska, {{have been used}} as reference times to investigate ionospheric height variations for possible associations with substorms. The ionospheric data were obtained from routine scalings of ionograms from an equatorial station (Kodaikanal) and a low-latitude station (Okinawa) covering the period of time from July 1957 to December 1961. The analysis, which uses a superposed-epoch technique, shows that significant height rises occur at these stations for periods sometimes in excess of 12 hr following the times of the selected onsets. There is some evidence to suggest that these positive effects may contain several components. However, interpretation of this fine structure is hindered by the presence of what appears to be another phenomenon which consists of a negative height displacement having a maximum influence at times ranging from 5 to 8 hours after onset times. Phenomena which, it is suggested, could possibly be associated with these positive and negative effects are electric fields, and <b>travelling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Travelling</b> <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Disturbances</b> (TIDs) are {{signatures}} of atmospheric gravity waves. By monitoring the Total Electron Content {{as a direct}} result of ground based GNSS measurements one can determine TIDs. A dense network of GNSS receivers over Europe provides allows estimating f wavelength, propagation direction and phase speed of the TIDs. Usually, TIDs are observed after geomagnetic storms and are having wavelengths of the order of about 2000 km, a southward orientation and a mean phase speed of about 700 ms- 1. A correlation of TID amplitudes with the auroral electrojet index, AE, indicates ionospheric Joule heating, located within the vicinity of the auroral oval, as a possible source of TIDs. The source region of the TIDs is having a similar southward extension as the polar electrojet system during enhanced geomagnetic conditions. Their propagation is discussed in relation to the southward propagation of enhanced ionization fronts and the perturbation induced dilation of the auroral oval towards lower latitudes. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we focus on {{deriving}} measures of the activity of wavelike perturbation processes in the ionosphere, called <b>Travelling</b> <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Disturbances</b> (TIDs). The TID activity has {{a significant impact on}} the accuracy and reliability of precise Global Positioning System (GPS) reference network applications. Because of its dual frequency, signals received from GPS satellites enable extracting information of the dispersive ionosphere. The European area is covered with dense networks of GPS receivers providing data with frequencies of 1 / 30 to 1 Hz. The good data coverage of more than 150 ground stations enables calculating maps of the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> activity with high accuracy. It is shown that in the course of several storms significant wave packets may be generated at high latitudes. These waves are assigned to large scale TIDs propagating equatorwards. Typical wave parameters such as velocity, wave length and direction can be estimated from the maps. The results support recent findings by other authors. In this study, additionally ionospheric radio occultation data will be used to detect the proven large scale TIDs. The differential TEC derived from low earth orbiting satellites is supposed to reveal information about the vertical spreading of these TIDs...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the 15 May 2005 severe {{geomagnetic}} storm on the South African iono-sphere are studied using ground-based and satellite observations. <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> have less frequently been investigated over mid-latitude regions. Recently, {{a number of studies}} investigated their evolution and generation over these regions. This paper reports on the first investigation of <b>travelling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> (TIDs) over mid-latitude South Africa. Using Global Positioning System (GPS) -derived total electron content (TEC) variations from the South African network of dual frequency GPS receivers, we were able to examine the {{effects of the}} disturbance on the quiet-time TEC. Two TEC enhancements were observed at low- and mid-latitudes: the first observed between 30 - 45 ◦S geomagnetic lati-tudes associated with equatorward neutral winds and the passage of a TID, and the second TEC enhancement associated with a second TID. In addition, the F-region critical frequency (foF 2) values observed at two ionosonde stations show that the ionospheric response as seen by ionosondes was different from that of the TEC response during the disturbance period. The dissimilarity between the TEC and the foF 2 suggests that two competing drivers ex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Gravity {{waves are}} an {{important}} feature of meso-sphere – lower thermosphere (MLT) dynamics, observed us-ing many techniques and providing an important mecha-nism for energy transfer between atmospheric regions. It is known that some gravity waves may propagate through the mesopause and reach greater altitudes before eventu-ally “breaking ” and depositing energy. The generation, propagation, and breaking of upper thermospheric gravity waves have not been studied directly often. However, their <b>ionospheric</b> counterparts, <b>travelling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> (TIDs), have been extensively studied in, for example, radar data. At high latitudes, it is believed localised auroral ac-tivity may generate gravity waves in-situ. Increases in sen-sor efficiency of Fabry-Perot Interferometers (FPIs) located in northern Scandinavia have provided higher time resolu-tion measurements of the auroral oval and polar cap atomic oxygen red line emission at 630. 0 nm. A Lomb-Scargle anal-ysis of this data has shown evidence of gravity wave activity with periods ranging from a few tens of minutes to several hours. Oscillations are seen in {{the intensity of the}} line as well as the temperatures and line of sight winds. Instrument...|$|R
40|$|This paper first {{discusses}} {{some early}} results (most hitherto unpublished) on off-vertical reflections which result from tilted isoionic contours {{associated with the}} passage of <b>travelling</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> (TIDs). Azimuth of arrival and zenith angle information on these returning signals is discussed together with the role of these signals in producing both resolved and unresolved range spread on ionograms. Some ray tracing through a model ionosphere which incorporates wavelike structures is shown to predict fixed-frequency patterns (on recordings of virtual height vs. time) of converging and diverging satellite traces similar to those observed in practice. New experimental evidence is then presented to suggest (from the N(h) analyses performed) that TID wavetrains of several cycles are effective in producing spread traces on ionograms by specular reflections from the tilted surfaces of each cycle of these wavetrains. Ionograms from a modern ionosonde show that range spread consists primarily of discrete satellite traces even though at times these traces overlap and vary in intensity as a function of frequency thus creating a diffuse range spread ionogram...|$|R
