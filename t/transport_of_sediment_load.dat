In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} the adverse effects that growth has had on Gwinnett County’s aquatic resources, the county has developed a comprehensive Watershed Improvement Program (WIP). The focus of the WIP is to address areas negatively affected by increased stormwater flows and ongoing land use practices from urban development. The Lake Claiborne project {{is part of the}} Sweetwater Creek WIP Implementation. The goals of the restoration project were to improve water quality, habitat, biology, and the overall condition and health of Sweetwater Creek, its tributary and Lake Claiborne. Prior to construction, the lake had a surface area of approximately 5 acres. The lake drainage area is 554 acres, with an impervious cover of 25 percent. The lake was constructed in the 1960 s with a significantly larger open water footprint. The lake filled in with sediment over the years from increased development within the watershed. As a result, the stream segments were aggraded and the depth of the lake decreased. Pre-construction water quality sampling and biological monitoring determined macroinvertebrate habitats were poor. Post-construction monitoring will be performed to measure improvements. Construction, completed in June 2011, included removing accumulated sediment to restore the original design capacity and increase flood storage capacity. The lake outlet control structure was modified to provide detention and peak flow attenuation. Stream restoration included redesigning the two streams flowing to the lake by restoring the channel geometry and profiles to improve <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load.</b> Offline ponds for sediment accumulation were built within the original 100 -year floodplain boundary of the lake. Grading was done around the lake to establish a functional littoral zone to provide additional filtering and habitat. Finally, enhancement of the riparian buffer was accomplished by removing invasive vegetation and replanting with native species. Sponsored by: Georgia Environmental Protection Division; U. S.

30|$|Form {{factor is}} a {{dimensionless}} {{ratio of the}} area (A) of a drainage basin to the square of its maximum length (Lb) (Horton 1932). Basin shape may be indexed by simple dimensionless ratios of the basic measurements area, perimeter and length (Singh 1998). Form factor is an indicator for flood formation and move, degree <b>of</b> erosion and <b>transport</b> capacities <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> in a watershed. The Ff of CW is 0.13 and that of 9 sub-watersheds (Table  3) varies from 0.17 to 0.24. The value of Ff varies from 0 (highly elongated shape) to unity i.e.; 1 (perfect circular shape). Main watershed and sub-watersheds shows a lower value of Ff which implies more elongated basin with flatter peak of low flow for longer duration, lower erosion and sediment transport capacities and favors a diminution of floods because streams flow into the main stream at greater time intervals and space which leads to ground water percolation.|$|R
25|$|Igapó {{forests are}} {{characterized}} by sandy acidic soils that have a low nutrient content. The color and acidity of the water {{is due to the}} acidic organic humic substances (e.g. tannins) that dissolve into the water. The acidity from the water translates into acidic soils. They are the more nutrient poor than a comparable várzea forest. They also “carry less suspended inorganic elements and contain elevated concentrations of dissolved organic material such as humic and fulvic acids”. Therefore, igapó forests support comparatively less life and the environment found within these areas tend to lack species diversity and animal biomass. Várzea forest soils have high nutrient contents because they receive a <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> high <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> from the whitewater rivers. In contrast, igapó forests do not receive this seasonal influx <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> which explains the nutrient poor soils. However, they do have the highest phosphorus concentrations out of comparable várzea and terra firme forest soils. Nevertheless, the seasonal inundation of the soils leads to anoxic conditions which limits plant growth.|$|R
40|$|This work {{is carried}} out for {{estimate}} the soil erosion and sediment yield for a watershed by using a spatio-temporal modeling approach. The erosion {{in the study area}} is mainly precipitation- based runoff erosion and direct soil discharge by erosion. This model predicts the peak discharge, soil erosion, and sediment yield from the eroded watershed area. Methods are developed for directly linking the distributed parameter model, with a Geographic Information System (GIS). This Model is an event-based model that simulates Peak discharge and the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> from watersheds. This direct linkage results in a powerful, up-to-date tool that would be capable of monitoring and instantaneously visualizing the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> any pollutant / sediment that USLE/MUSLE can simulate. Thereby, it reduces the time required to analyze the numerical output from this model, and enables users to identify critical areas <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> and peak discharge. Especially, this model is very effective in identifying erosion, sediment yield in selected points of stream. The spatial and temporal correlation between the actual soil losses due to water erosion and that is <b>transported</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load.</b> Further analysis <b>of</b> the relationship in terms of percentages of land use in the area, and the sediment contribution from the different type of land uses performed...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the resuspension, {{deposition}} and <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> and the resulting changes in bathymetry in {{the lower part of}} the Saginaw River in Michigan has been made. The numerical model used in this study consists of a two-dimensional, vertically integrated, time-dependent hydrodynamic and transport model coupled with a three-dimensional, time-dependent model of the dynamics <b>of</b> the <b>sediment</b> bed and its properties. <b>Transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> as suspended <b>load</b> and bed load was included in the analysis. In the numerical calculations, curvilinear coordinates were used. For verification of the model, results of numerical calculations of changes in the thickness <b>of</b> the <b>sediment</b> bed due to time-varying flow events were compared with bathyrnetric measurements taken at nine transects on the river on 28 August 1991 and 13 May 1992. From the transect measurements, from measurements of flow rates and sediment concentrations, and from the numerical modelling, a reasonably accurate description <b>of</b> the <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> and the resulting bathymetric changes has been made. The calculations and observations show that resuspension/deposition, bed load, and slumping are significant factors in changing the bathymetry. It is also shown that the largest flows are responsible for most <b>of</b> the <b>sediment</b> erosion and deposition and must therefore be understood and considered in detail. An approximate procedure for making long-term (1 to 25 year) calculations is presented and discussed.

40|$|An {{idealized}} morphodynamic {{model is}} used to gain further understanding about the formation and characteristics of shoreface-connected sand ridges and tidal sand banks on the continental shelf. The model consists of the 2 D shallow water equations, supplemented with a sediment transport formulation and describes the initial feedback between currents and small amplitude bed forms. The behaviour of bed forms during both storm and fair weather conditions is analyzed. This is relevant in case of coastal seas characterized by tidal motion, where the latter causes continuous <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> as bed <b>load.</b> The new aspects of this work are the incorporation of both steady and tidal currents (represented by an M 2 and M 4 component) in the external forcing, in combination with dominant suspended sediment transport during storms. The {{results indicate that the}} dynamics during storms and fair weather strongly differ, causing different types of bed forms to develop. Shoreface-connected sand ridges mainly form during storm conditions, whereas if fair weather conditions prevail the more offshore located tidal sand banks develop. Including the M 4 tide changes the properties of the bed forms, such as growth rates and migration speeds, due to tidal asymmetry. Finally a probabilistic formulation of the storm and fair weather realization of the model {{is used to}} find conditions for which both types of large-scale bed forms occur simultaneously. These conditions {{turn out to be a}} low storm fraction and the presence strong tidal currents in combination with strong steady currents during storms. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{theory is}} developed that obtains Horton laws for six hydraulic–geometric (H–G) variables (stream discharge Q, width W, depth D, velocity U, slope S, and friction n') in self-similar Tokunaga {{networks in the}} limit of a large network order. The theory uses several disjoint theoretical concepts like Horton laws of stream numbers and areas as asymptotic relations in Tokunaga networks, dimensional analysis, the Buckingham Pi theorem, asymptotic self-similarity of the first kind, or SS- 1, and asymptotic self-similarity of the second kind, or SS- 2. A self-contained review of these concepts, with examples, is given as "methods". The H–G data sets in channel networks from three published studies and one unpublished study are summarized to test theoretical predictions. The theory builds on six independent dimensionless river-basin numbers. A mass conservation equation in terms of Horton bifurcation and discharge ratios in Tokunaga networks is derived. Assuming that the H–G variables are homogeneous and self-similar functions of stream discharge, it is shown that the functions are of a power law form. SS- 1 is applied to predict the Horton laws for width, depth and velocity as asymptotic relationships. Exponents of width and the Reynolds number are predicted and tested against three field data sets. One basin shows deviations from theoretical predictions. Tentatively assuming that SS- 1 is valid for slope, depth and velocity, corresponding Horton laws and the H–G exponents are derived. Our predictions of the exponents are the same as those previously predicted for the optimal channel network (OCN) model. In direct contrast to our work, the OCN model does not consider Horton laws for the H–G variables, and uses optimality assumptions. The predicted exponents deviate substantially from the values obtained from three field studies, which suggests that H–G in networks does not obey SS- 1. It fails because slope, a dimensionless river-basin number, goes to 0 as network order increases, but, it cannot be eliminated from the asymptotic limit. Therefore, a generalization of SS- 1, based on SS- 2, is considered. It introduces two anomalous scaling exponents as free parameters, which enables us to show the existence of Horton laws for channel depth, velocity, slope and Manning friction. These two exponents are not predicted here. Instead, we used the observed exponents of depth and slope to predict the Manning friction exponent and to test it against field exponents from three studies. The same basin mentioned above shows some deviation from the theoretical prediction. A physical reason for this deviation is given, which identifies an important topic for research. Finally, we briefly sketch how the two anomalous scaling exponents could be estimated from the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> and the bed load. Statistical variability in the Horton laws for the H–G variables is also discussed. Both are important open problems for future research...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objectives}} of the present research can be summarised as: i-Critical investigation and computer programming <b>of</b> the existing <b>sediment</b> discharge computation methods, and ii-Fundamental development of more accurate and simpler sediment discharge and concentration distribution equations. The thesis {{can be divided into}} three parts. In the first part, technical comments and computational procedures are provided for a number <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> estimation models. The models included the most popular theories of Meyer-Peter and Muller, Einstein, Bagnold, Engelund-Hansen, Toffaleti, Ackers-White, and Yang, and the recently developed methods of van Rijn, Wiuff, Samaga et aI, and Celik-Rodi. Deficiency and drawbacks of the selected theories are analysed and modified equations are suggested for a number of theories. Since the computation <b>of</b> the <b>transport</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> in open channel flows is usually a complicated and laborious task, new computer programs have been developed for all of the 11 selected methods {{as well as for the}} proposed transport equations. The developed computer package (SEDLOAD) can be regarded as an efficient and powerful tool for practicing alluvial hydraulic engineers. Using the advantages of regression analysis and numerical integration techniques, analytical procedures are presented for all graphs and tables given in the selected theories. The selected <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> predictors are tested against 333 sets <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> data from both laboratory flumes and natural rivers. Limitations in the applicability of the theories are highlighted through this analysis. The test results generally show large discrepancies between the predicted transport rates and the actual measurements from one theory to another. None of the methods were found to be adequate for all conditions. In the second part of the thesis which is more significant, based on the fundamental concepts of hydraulics, turbulence energy and particle motion, a new theory is developed for the estimation of concentration as well as bed and suspended load <b>transport</b> rates <b>of</b> non-uniform bed material in river systems. The proposed equations are applicable to uniform steady sediment-laden flows. The relations are derived for bed material load and do not include wash <b>load.</b> The <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> capacity <b>of</b> the flow is computed through the proposed equations, assuming that the bed material supply is more than the transport capacity. The proposed equations are non-dimensional and fully analytical. The parameters involved are well-known and easily measurable. A number of other formulae, such as depth-averaged concentration, transport concentration, and reference concentration have been determined using the developed theory. In comparison with the well-established Rouse concentration equation, the proposed concentration formula produced better concentration profiles when applied to a number of published laboratory flume measurements. Applying the developed suspended load equation to 175 sets of suspended load data resulted in a score of 91 % which is regarded as an exce 1 lent accuracy in the field <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>transport.</b> When applied to abou t 100 sets <b>of</b> bed load <b>transport</b> data and compared with the other existing bed load predictors, the developed bed load formula always gave better predictions. In general, testing against 333 sets <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> data confirmed the better predicability <b>of</b> the proposed <b>transport</b> equations compared to the other selected theories. The recent contributions and difficulties <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> research in Australian rivers are discussed in the third part. Fine grain sizes, a high proportion of wash load, and low values of energy slope are the main characteristics of major inland rivers in Australia. An attempt was made to introduce the most appropriate <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> predictor for the computation <b>of</b> bed material <b>transport</b> rate in a particular Australian rivulet. However, due to the unavailability <b>of</b> measured <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> data, no conclusive decision could be made. It is, therefore, recommended that no particular equation be selected unless its accuracy is tested against actual measured data from <b>sediment</b> <b>loads.</b> Review <b>of</b> the Australian literature indicates that the major difficulty with sediment transport research all around Australia is the lack of published data...|$|R
40|$|In {{the western}} US, climate change, water development, and the {{encroachment}} of non-native species {{during the past}} century contributed to changes in channel morphology. Reaches with mid-channel bars or islands narrowed and simplified first, and {{to a greater degree}} than other settings on gravel bed rivers with large fine <b>sediment</b> <b>loads.</b> Maintenance <b>of</b> mid-channel bars, and their associated secondary channels on these rivers, requires regular <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> the fine <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> through the reach. A reduction in the transport capacity, resulting from reduced flows or the expansion of vegetation, for example, results in the accumulation <b>of</b> fine <b>sediment</b> and inevitably leads to secondary channel abandonment (i. e., channel narrowing). Working in the Yampa Canyon in western Colorado, we identify the mechanisms that maintain, or conversely degrade, the mid-channel bar and secondary channel by maintaining (or not) the throughput <b>of</b> fine <b>sediment.</b> A novel observation-based model built from repeat LiDAR and a 2 D hydraulic model of three recent flood events, applied to historical topographic, vegetation, and hydrologic conditions, provides a robust series of observations on the processes by which a secondary channel narrowed and filled in with fine sediment during the past 50 years. The streamwise location of the bifurcation point at the upstream end of the bar where the flow divides dictated the relationship between flood magnitude and fine sediment accumulation or evacuation. The elevation and roughness (i. e., vegetation coverage and density) of the mid-channel bar determined the location of the bifurcation during floods with a different recurrence. When the mid-channel bar was low, with little vegetation, floods with a two-year recurrence or less could evacuate fine sediment from the area. As vegetation established and the fine sediment on the mid-channel bar grew vertically and laterally, the bifurcation location for the two-year flood was pushed further upstream. Reduced momentum across the bar resulted in fine sediment deposition, not erosion. As a result, it took larger and larger floods to evacuate fine sediment. Therefore, fine sediment became a more permanent feature across a larger part of the bar, supporting greater new vegetation recruitment. Increasing cyclicity of large and small floods {{in the latter half of}} the study period also promoted plant establishment. Fine sediment deposition occurs over a wider range of flows within vegetation than outside. Synthesizing our robust historical reconstruction and observations from other multi-thread settings in the Yampa Canyon, we build a conceptual model of mid-channel bar maintenance that identifies aspects of the flood regime based on valley geometry and channel morphology necessary to maintain multiple channels. This model furthers our fundamental understanding of the multi- thread planform and may more efficiently guide the management of rivers...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Exact {{prediction}} <b>of</b> <b>transported</b> <b>sediment</b> rate by {{rivers in}} water resources projects {{is of utmost}} importance. Basically erosion and sediment transport process {{is one of the}} most complexes hydrodynamic. Although different studies have been developed on the application of intelligent models based on neural, they are not widely used because of lacking explicitness and complexity governing on choosing and architecting of proper network. In this study, a Genetic expression programming model (as an important branches of evolutionary algorithems) for predicting <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> is selected and investigated as an intelligent approach along with other known classical and imperical methods such as Larsen´s equation, Engelund-Hansen´s equation and Bagnold´s equation. Materials and Methods: In this study, in order to improve explicit prediction <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> <b>of</b> Gotoorchay, located in Aras catchment, Northwestern Iran latitude: 38 ° 24 ´ 33. 3 ˝ and longitude: 44 ° 46 ´ 13. 2 ˝), genetic programming (GP) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) were applied. Moreover, the semi-empirical models for predicting <b>of</b> total <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> and rating curve have been used. Finally all the methods were compared and the best ones were introduced. Two statistical measures were used to compare the performance of the different models, namely root mean square error (RMSE) and determination coefficient (DC). RMSE and DC indicate the discrepancy between the observed and computed values. Results and Discussions: The statistical characteristics results obtained from the analysis of genetic programming method for both selected model groups indicated that the model 4 including the only discharge of the river, relative to other studied models had the highest DC and the least RMSE in the testing stage (DC= 0. 907, RMSE= 0. 067). Although there were several parameters applied in other models, these models were complicated and had weak results of prediction. Our results showed that the model 9, with the most DC and the least RMSE (DC= 0. 694, RMSE= 0. 081), had the relative advantage to the other none dimensional models. Finally it is clear that the model 6 had more predicting capability rather than the model 9, so among all the models, model 6 was the best referring model for estimation <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> <b>of</b> the Ghotoorchay river. Conclusion: It was observed that the model including only the discharge of the Ghotoorchay river the best model for estimation <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> and it was applied for comparing all the other sediment predicting models such as some classic methods that includes Larsen´s equation, Engelund-Hansen´s equation and Bagnold´s equation and optimized rating curve.

Many investigations have been done on these phenomena throughout the years. Programs to predict morphological changes along a granular coast are developed by several countries. In the Netherlands Delft Hydraulics developed the cross-shore profile model UNIBEST-TC. The program considers uniform longshore <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> and does not incorporate the option of inserting a gradient in longshore <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment.</b> In reality this gradient in longshore <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> will often occur and it can be of considerable importance to certain coastal developments. In a recent extension of the program, which is still on a experimental basis, the option to incorporate this gradient was included. In this study the effect of a gradient in wave driven longshore <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> on the shape of the cross-shore profile was investigated. It was also investigated whether an inclusion of a gradient in longshore <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> in the program UNIBEST-TC leads to a better simulation of the measured bottom evolution at eroding and accreting profiles. Furthermore it was investigated whether the differences in large scale coastal behaviour at the different regions along the Dutch coast can be explained by a gradient in longshore <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment.</b> It showed that, with an eroding gradient in longshore <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> included in the program UNIBEST-TC, the profile becomes more steep in the breaker zone and the bar height and offshore migration speed of the bars is decreased. With an accreting gradient in longshore <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> the opposite occurs: the profile becomes less steep in the breaker zone and the bar height and offshore migration speed ofthe bars is increased. Stable, eroding and accreting profiles along the closed part of the Holland coast were recognised using the JARKUS-data and the extended measurements. For several profiles along the coast simulations were made with and without the gradient included. It was tried to establish one model-setting for all profiles along the Dutch coast, to get {{a clear view of the}} effect of the gradient. This last showed to be very difficult or even impossible, which is probably caused by either difficulties in the simulation of the differences in cross-shore transport between the different regions alongshore or due to other phenomena not taken into account in the program UNIBEST-TC. From the analysis on the profile volume and profile steepness in this study, it was found that the inclusion of the gradient in longshore <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> in UNIBEST-TC has a positive effect on the simulation of the development of the general profile shape of eroding and accreting profiles. Also the accretion near the shoreline, caused by cross-shore import <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> from the deeper parts of the profile, with a profile indicated as stable from the measurements, can be reduced using an eroding gradient. Because of the limited time for this study only a few profiles along the Dutch coast were observed. It was found that from this limited amount of investigated profiles no real conclusions can be drawn concerning the question whether the differences in large scale coastal behaviour at the different regions alongshore can be explained by a gradient in longshore <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment.</b> Only a few assumption were made. A thorough investigation on this subject could be made in a future study. In this study also a method to calculate the gradient in longshore <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> was developed. Though in the calculation of the gradient some simplifications were made, the results are satisfactory. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Sediment's color and texture affirmed the land-based activities in Babuyan and Mauyon watersheds, which eventually carried into the Bay during storm weather condition.

40|$|From {{the results}} of {{monitoring}} {{of the quality of}} surface water in the Hnilec and Hornád rivers and their tributaries followed that in addition to industrial toxic substances, it were the heavy metals from localities of former and still continuing mining, treatment or metallurgic activities that significantly influence a long-term polution. The subsequent project showed a need to monitor the impact of anthropogenic activity, namely on the Waterwork (VD) Ruín I. It was a task of our institution to judge the quality <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> in the waterwork area. The first samples <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> the waterwork were taken in 1994. The sampling process then continued on the same places in following years. The special methods <b>of</b> sampling <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> (<b>sediments)</b> from the waterwork bed were worked out depending on the locality of sampling. The total analysis of obtained air-dried samples was caried out using the AAS method. The heavy metals were also analysed. In the consent with standards and requiremnts of the co-ordinator <b>of</b> task, the <b>sediment</b> deposits were assessed in consent with Decree of the Ministry of Land Managment of the Slovak Republik 531 / 1994 - 540 on the highest admissible values of harmful subsatances in land. Comparing {{the results of}} sampling we have observed that the critical values have been achieved in case of Cu. Its high values were found in the branches of Hnilec and Hornád rivers, as well sa in the branch of Opátka. The increased contents of Co are in Beliansky and Opatsky branches, at the inflow of Hnilec and Folkmarsky brook into the waterwork. The position of Hg is interesting, as it was the main contaminating element of The Hornad river and its sediments in the past. Hg is not currently present at significant quantities. The vertical sampling was also carried out in the course of research. It was proved that the content of contaminating elements in <b>sediments</b> <b>of</b> waterwork originates in the industrial activity perfomed 15 - 25 ago. At present these sources of contamination are non-active. Special dumps-sludge basins represent an exeption, as they are sources of pollution of surface water, as well as of uderground water. In consent with the valid legislation, the supervision over the sludge-basins is performed by the sludge-basin keepers, who prepare assessment reports, available only to a limited number of experts. The results characterising waste waters from the sludge-basins in Smolník and Rudòany show that the water draining through a drainage system from the sludge-basins may significantly influence the quality of surface streams. From the mentioned facts follows {{that it is necessary to}} remove the contaminated <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> from VD Ruín I. The alternatives have been suggested. The contamination <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> in VD Ruín I. continues, so that the requirement for continuing far in monitoring its surface layer and water at least in 3 year intervals is substantiated. The evaluation of results of monitoring of waters leaving the sludge-basin will show, which of them decisively contribute to the contamination <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> in the reservoir of VD Ruín I. This should enable to prepare technical measures to capture the substantial quantity of contaminanting elements, so that in the future it would not be necessary, for the exploaitation <b>of</b> further <b>sediment</b> <b>loads,</b> to use expensive treatment procedures, this would result in the improvement of environment in the waterwork and its surrounding area...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: A {{study in}} Malaysia {{had been carried}} out to predict the {{sediment}} accumulation in urban detention ponds. Suspended <b>sediment</b> is pollutant <b>of</b> primary concern to the river that results in adverse environmental effect. Detention pond becomes a practical approach to this problem. Suspended sediment that settled in stormwater detention pond, can bring effect to the detention pond functions. Questions were raised on how certain were the observed and predicted values <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> depth and <b>load</b> accumulation estimations. Secondly the question was what the sediment accumulation be in the next 100 years. The uncertainties <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> estimation vary greatly due to the hydrological variability and rainfall random nature obtain the relationship between flow discharge and suspended sediment rate using on-site data collection at UTM and Ledang Heights, Nusajaya. Predict accumulated <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> and depth from MUSLE over 10 - 100 years. Analyze the uncertainties <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> and depth using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) combining normal distribution. Obtain the maximum probability <b>of</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> and depth in the detention pond. Approach: Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) and Trap Efficiency (TE) Method was applied to predict sediment accumulation. This uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> and depth was carried out using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) Method. The water samples were collected for suspended solids data and other water quality parameters at Ledang Heights, Nusajaya, Johor and University Technology Malaysia (UTM), Johor. Sampling station were randomly selected at the inlet and outlet of the detention pond. The hydrological parameters such as flow and velocity were also collected. Results: The simulation results showed the maximum probability of occurrence value for observed <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> and <b>sediment</b> depth from Ledang Heights were 0. 0062 tons (16. 5 %) and 0. 0005 mm (17. 5 %) respectively. The maximum probability of occurrence values for observed <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> and <b>sediment</b> depth at UTM showed no obvious differences with Ledang Heights; about 0. 015 tons (16. 8 %) and 0. 00037 mm (15. 5 %) respectively. The maximum occurrence <b>of</b> predicted <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> and <b>sediment</b> depth using MUSLE method for Ledang Height was 77. 8 tons (16. 8 %) and 7. 5 mm (26. 8 %) respectively. The maximum occurrence for UTM was slightly higher, about 264 tons (15. 70 %) and 7. 0 mm (21. 10 %) respectively. The higher values for UTM were suspected due to its larger watershed. The <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> and depths were also predicted for the next 50 - 100 years considering no significant watershed land use changes. Conclusion: The sediment accumulation estimation and forecasting {{are very important to}} ensure the effectiveness and proper operation of the detention pond. The continuous effort through natural sediment control measures such as proper vegetation and grass inplants are always encourage around the detention pond and surrounding areas throughout its lifespan...|$|R

With an aim to mitigate land degradation problems in Ethiopia, {{soil and water}} conservation projects are being massively implemented. The effect of these conservation measures in reducing sediment in streams have never been quantified due to unavailability <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> data. In a quantitative evaluation to quantify the contribution <b>of</b> intense event/daily <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> to annual <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> and effect <b>of</b> conservation measures in reducing erosion, we monitored three nested experimental sub-watersheds and a 95 ha main watershed in the sub-humid Ethiopian highlands, Debre Mawi watershed for four consecutive years. The contribution of the largest 10 –minute events and peak daily <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> to annual <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> and the effect of Best Management Practices (BMPs) on peak sediment transport processes were evaluated. The contribution of the largest event loads reached up to 22 % of the total annual <b>sediment</b> <b>loads.</b> The peak event <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> reached up to 11 t ha- 1. The contribution of the largest daily <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> events to annual loads is up to 86 %. For the two largest daily <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> events, the contribution reached up to 95 %. The total <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> the two largest daily <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> events ranged from 40 - 68 t ha- 1 day- 1 indicating that most <b>of</b> the annual <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> are transported with in one or two intense daily <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> events in the (sub) humid Ethiopian highlands.
