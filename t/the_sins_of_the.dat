5|$|Back in Europe, Bernard of Clairvaux was humiliated by the defeat. Bernard {{considered}} it {{his duty to}} send an apology to the Pope and it is inserted {{in the second part}} of his Book of Consideration. There he explains how <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures. When his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether. He would die in 1153.|$|E
5|$|Muslims {{believe that}} the stone was {{originally}} pure and dazzling white, but has since turned black because of <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people who touch it. Its black colour is deemed to symbolize the essential spiritual virtue of detachment and poverty for God (faqr) and the extinction of ego required to progress towards God (qalb).|$|E
5|$|Three major {{theological}} controversies {{occurred during}} Manuel's reign. In 1156–1157 {{the question was}} raised whether Christ had offered himself as a sacrifice for <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world to the Father and to the Holy Spirit only, or also to the Logos (i.e., to himself). In the end a synod held at Constantinople in 1157 adopted a compromise formula, that the Word made flesh offered a double sacrifice to the Holy Trinity, despite the dissidence of Patriarch of Antioch-elect Soterichus Panteugenus.|$|E

5|$|He {{would have}} tried to reconquer the {{province}} if he had the resources, but now he had neither the men nor the money to defend the province any more. Instead he retreated to the cathedral of Antioch, where he observed a solemn service of intercession. He summoned a meeting of his advisers at the cathedral and scrutinized the situation. He was told almost unanimously, and accepted the fact, that the defeat was God's decision and a result of <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people of the land, including him. Heraclius took to the sea on a ship to Constantinople in the night.|$|E
5|$|The Northern Celestial Masters {{followed}} certain regular, communal rites. One {{of these}} communal rites involved formal banquets. These feasts could {{last as long}} as seven days. In order to purify themselves for feasts, members had to abstain from eating meat, garlic, green onions, ginger, leeks and onions. A banquet consisted of three courses – wine, rice and a vegetarian meal. Ritual activity during feasts and other activities usually involved a series of bows and prostrations as well as the burning of incense. Banquets were also held when someone died. During these banquets, attendees would perform rituals aimed at remitting <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona I {{planted a}} pair of royal fig trees {{at the far end}} of the Bevato {{compound}} and stood between them when addressing the public. These were later complemented by additional fig trees planted all around the courtyard by Ranavalona II and jacarandas planted by the French during the colonial period. The figs that shade the esplanade are believed to be imbued with hasina enhanced by the bones and skulls of sacrificed zebu and special marking stones that pilgrims from across Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion and Comoros have come to place around them. Pilgrims gather in this courtyard to celebrate the Fandroana ceremony, during which time the sovereign historically engaged in a ritual bath to wash away <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation and restore order and harmony to society. Today, pilgrims celebrate by offering sacrifices or prayers to honor, appease or commune with their ancestors.|$|E
2500|$|Rashi {{explained}} that in [...] God required {{the people to}} bring a young bull as an offering, because [...] required such an offering to make atonement when the community had committed idolatry (and they were atoning for <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Golden Calf).|$|R

25|$|Some have {{contended that}} the {{doctrine}} of particular redemption implies that Christ's sacrifice was insufficient to atone for <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole world, but Calvinists have universally rejected this notion, instead holding {{that the value of}} the atonement is infinite but that God intentionally withholds its efficacious availability only to the elect.|$|E

25|$|Hindus {{consider}} {{the waters of}} the Ganges to be both pure and purifying. Nothing reclaims order from disorder more than {{the waters of the}} Ganges. Moving water, as in a river, is considered purifying in Hindu culture because it is thought to both absorb impurities and take them away. The swiftly moving Ganges, especially in its upper reaches, where a bather has to grasp an anchored chain in order to not be carried away, is considered especially purifying. What the Ganges removes, however, is not necessarily physical dirt, but symbolic dirt; it wipes away <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bather, not just of the present, but of a lifetime.|$|E

2500|$|Some Catholic theologians, {{among them}} Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Piet Schoonenberg, and Karl Rahner, have {{discussed}} <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> how evolutionary theory relates to <b>the</b> doctrine <b>of</b> original <b>sin.</b> [...] They generally question <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> a human fall from an original state of perfection {{and a common}} theme among them, most explicitly stated by Rahner, is to see Adam's <b>sin</b> as <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire human community, which provides a resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> polygenism.|$|R
50|$|Based on Hebrew Bible narrative, <b>the</b> {{consequence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> golden calf was {{the desire}} by God to annihilate the entire congregation.

Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno on Deuteronomy 10:8 writes that Moses attempted to convince God that the priesthood should remain with the firstborn but was not successful.|$|R
25|$|The {{first and}} chief article is this: Jesus Christ, our God and Lord, died for our sins and was raised again for our {{justification}} (Romans 3:24–25). He alone is the Lamb of God who takes away <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world (John 1:29), and God has laid on Him the iniquity {{of us all}} (Isaiah 53:6). All have sinned and are justified freely, without their own works and merits, by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, in His blood (Romans 3:23–25). This is necessary to believe. This cannot be otherwise acquired or grasped by any work, law or merit. Therefore, it is clear and certain that this faith alone justifies us... Nothing of this article can be yielded or surrendered, even though heaven and earth and everything else falls (Mark 13:31).|$|E
25|$|The lamb {{stands on}} an altar, and is {{surrounded}} by 14 angels arranged in a circle, some holding symbols of Christ's Passion, and two swing censers. The lamb has a wound on its breast from which blood gushes into a golden chalice, yet it shows no outward expression of pain, a reference to Christ's sacrifice. The angels have multicolored wings and hold instruments of Christ's passion, including the cross and the crown of thorns. The antependium on the upper portion of {{the front of the}} altar is inscribed with the words taken from John 1:29; ECCE AGNUS DEI QUI TOLLIT PECCATA MUNDI ("Behold the Lamb of God who takes away <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world"). The lappets bear the phrases IHESUS VIA ("Jesus the Way") and VERITAS VITA ("the Truth, the Life").|$|E
25|$|The {{theology}} of Ezekiel is notable for {{its contribution to}} the emerging notion of individual responsibility to God – each man would be held responsible only for his own sins. This is {{in marked contrast to}} the Deuteronomistic writers, who held that <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation would be held against all, without regard for an individual's personal guilt. Nonetheless, Ezekiel shared many ideas in common with the Deuteronomists, notably the notion that God works according to the principle of retributive justice and an ambivalence towards kingship (although the Deuteronomists reserved their scorn for individual kings rather than for the office itself). As a priest, Ezekiel praises the Zadokites over the Levites (lower level temple functionaries), whom he largely blames for the destruction and exile. He is clearly connected with the Holiness Code and its vision of a future dependent on keeping the Laws of God and maintaining ritual purity. Notably, Ezekiel blames the Babylonian exile not on the people's failure to keep the Law, but on their worship of gods other than Yahweh and their injustice: these, says Ezekiel in chapters 8–11, are the reasons God's Shekhinah left his city and his people.|$|E
