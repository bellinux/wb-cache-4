He organized the region's chickpea farmers in a producer's league and briefly entertained <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> to France to fight {{on the side of the}} Allies in World War I. He made a considerable amount of money in these years, and also entertained many visitors. As the victorious general of the Mexican Revolution, Obregón remained enormously popular throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|Narendra visited Ahmedabad, Wadhwan and Limbdi; at the former, he {{completed}} his studies of Islamic and Jain cultures. At Limbdi he met Thakur Saheb Jaswant Singh, {{who had been}} to England and America. From him, Narendra first got <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> to the West to preach Vedanta. He visited Junagadh and was the guest of Haridas Viharidas Desai, diwan of the state, who was so charmed by his company that every evening he and all the state officials conversed with Narendra until late at night. Narendra also visited Girnar, Kutch, Porbander, Dwaraka, Palitana, Nadiad, Nadiad ni haveli and Baroda. He remained for nine months at Porbander, furthering his philosophical and Sanskrit studies with learned pandits.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} St. Mary's in May 1930, Lady Bird toyed with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> back to Alabama. Another friend from Marshall {{was going to}} the University of Texas, so she {{chartered}} a plane to Austin to join her. As the plane landed, she was awed by the sight of a field covered with bluebonnets and instantly {{fell in love with the}} city. Lady Bird received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history with honors in 1933 and a second bachelor's degree in journalism cum laude in 1934. She was active on campus in different organizations, such as Orange Jackets, and believed in student leadership. Her goal was to become a reporter, but she also earned a teaching certificate.|$|E

25|$|Aswathanarayana had a {{difficult}} childhood because of poverty. He was {{a student of the}} Municipal High School, Ongole, Andhra Pradesh, India. He nearly missed the mathematics examination in the Secondary School Leaving Certificate of the then Madras Presidency when he reached the examination hall 30 minutes late, as he had to walk barefoot in the hot sun for a considerable distance. He scored 100% marks in mathematics and set up a record for aggregate marks in the examination. Despite his meritorious performance in the high school, he almost gave up <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> to college because his parents could not afford it. Ultimately his mother had to sell whatever jewels she had to send him to college and then to university after a gap of time.|$|E
500|$|Andros {{was well}} {{received}} at court {{upon his return}} to England. [...] The king in particular recalled that Andros had visited his court in the Netherlands, and expressed approval of Andros' service. [...] In search of employment, Andros offered his services as a spy, offering <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> to Paris, ostensibly {{to meet with the}} exiled James, but to actually attempt to acquire French military plans. [...] This plan was rejected. [...] While in England he married for the second time, to Elizabeth Crisp Clapham, in July 1691. [...] She was the widow of Christopher Clapham, who was connected by that marriage to his first wife's family.|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot is}} meant to be the [...] "template of the series". Kitsis {{confirmed}} that every week will contain flashbacks between both worlds, as they [...] "love <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> back and forth and informing what the character is missing in their life." [...] The writers' desire to present a [...] "mash up" [...] of many small characters can be seen in a scene of the pilot, {{in which there is a}} war council featuring Geppetto, Pinocchio, and Grumpy. Horowitz elaborated, [...] "One of the fun things for us coming up with these stories is thinking of ways these different characters can interact in ways they never have before." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of Iwata's promotion, Nintendo, though still a {{profitable}} company, was not performing {{as well as other}} console makers. The recently released GameCube was performing poorly compared to competitors, with Sony's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox outselling it. His presidency also came {{at the onset of the}} popularization of online gaming, and Nintendo had yet to move into this facet of the market. He took a cautious approach to the issue, stating: [...] "We're not negative toward <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> online. We're just practical." [...] He also fostered a relationship between Nintendo and Capcom that improved the GameCube's appeal. During an interview in 2002, Iwata stated that he felt the gaming industry was becoming too exclusive, and he wanted to develop hardware and games that would appeal to all players rather than focusing on top of the line graphics.|$|E
500|$|Archibald Gracie {{was also}} heading aft, {{but as he}} made his way towards the stern he found his path blocked by [...] "a mass of {{humanity}} several lines deep, covering the boat deck, facing us"– hundreds of steerage passengers, who had finally made it to the deck just as the last lifeboats departed. He gave up on <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> aft and jumped into the water to get away from the crowd. Others made no attempt to escape. The ship's designer, Thomas Andrews, was reportedly last seen in the first-class smoking room, having removed his lifebelt, staring at the painting above the fireplace. Captain Smith's fate is unclear as there are conflicting accounts of his death; he either entered the wheelhouse on the bridge and died there when it was engulfed or jumped into the water just before the bridge was submerged and subsequently perished in the water, possibly near Collapsible B.|$|E
500|$|Some European monarchs responded {{positively}} to Mongol inquiries, but became vague and evasive {{when asked to}} actually commit troops and resources. Logistics also became more complex– the Egyptian Mamluks were genuinely concerned about the threat of another wave of Crusader forces, so each time the Mamluks captured another castle or port, instead of occupying it, they systematically destroyed {{it so that it}} could never be used again. This both made it more difficult for the Crusaders to plan military operations, and increased the expense of those operations. Monarchs in Western Europe often gave [...] to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> on crusade, as a way of making an emotional appeal to their subjects, but in reality they would take years to prepare, and sometimes never actually left for Outremer. Internal wars in Europe, such as the War of the Vespers, were also distracting attention, and making it less likely for European nobles to want to commit their military to the Crusades, when they were more needed at home.|$|E

500|$|While Creation {{were pleased}} with the final album, and the initial music press reviews were positive, the label soon {{realised}} that although, {{in the words of}} plugger James Kyllo, [...] "it was such a beautiful record, and it was wonderful to have it... it just didn't sound like a record that was going to recoup all the money that had been spent on it." [...] Alan McGee liked the record, but admitted, [...] "It was quite clear that we couldn't bear <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> through that again, because there was just nothing to say that [...] wouldn't do exactly the same again. That's enough. Lets step back". Despite a severe shortage of money, Creation funded a short tour of the north of England late in 1991. At the time the band were making the marketing of Loveless difficult—there would be no singles, and the band's name was forbidden to appear on the record sleeve. McGee was by now exhausted and frustrated. He recalled, [...] "I thought: I went to the wall for you. If this record bombs, I've stolen my father's money. And they were so...not understanding of anybody else's position." [...] McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation soon after the album's release because he could not bear working with Shields again; [...] "It was either him or me", he told The Guardian in 2004. Loveless peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart, and failed to chart in the United States, where it was distributed by Sire Records. In 2003 Rolling Stone estimated the sales figures for Loveless as 225,000 copies sold.|$|E

2500|$|Next, the Hungarians entered France itself via Nice, {{where they}} {{had to give up}} their arms and the {{authorities}} regarded them with considerable suspicion. The Hungarians, kept for a considerable time in Toulon, conceived <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> to the Ottoman Empire, where some Hungarians already got refuge (and many more would follow in the coming years). However, the French disliked this idea, attempting to send them instead to Algiers, where, Türr feared, the Hungarian Legion would [...] "melt down".

2500|$|In {{his early}} years, {{following}} his parents’ wishes, Klee focused on becoming a musician; {{but he decided}} on the visual arts during his teen years, partly out of rebellion {{and partly because of}} a belief that modern music lacked meaning for him. He stated, [...] "I didn't find <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> in for music creatively particularly attractive in view of the decline in the history of musical achievement." [...] As a musician, he played and felt emotionally bound to traditional works of the eighteenth and nineteenth century, but as an artist he craved the freedom to explore radical ideas and styles. At sixteen, Klee’s landscape drawings already show considerable skill.|$|E
2500|$|Turpin {{had tried}} to join various {{services}} that could be vehicles for his work, but either got no replies or they wanted other things than what he could provide. [...] He was attracted {{to the work of}} Dr. Tom Dooley who had previously worked in medical relief in Vietnam. He got <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> to Hong Kong because of some TV coverage related through a patient's mother at Casa de Todos. He left for Hong Kong in September 1961 on an exploratory trip to feel out the need, logistics and possibilities. From this exploration his attention was focused on two areas - the people living on boats and the Kowloon Walled City. He ran into legal and cultural protocols he had failed to appreciate, and needed to register with the [...] "British Medical Council" [...] to run a clinic. They gained a match because they were a nurses group who needed a doctor and had patients and he was a doctor that needed patients.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{touring the}} Mediterranean with Lina in 1904, the couple stopped over in Palestine, expecting {{it to be}} but one stop of many. He wrote, [...] "On {{reaching}} Jerusalem, we changed our plans. All {{that we saw in}} the Holy Land made such a deep impression on us that we gave up <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> to other places. Visiting the holy sights of which one hears and reads since childhood, watching the scenes in life as pictured in the Bible, was most soul-stirring. From that time on we felt a strange and intense desire to return to the land." [...] Nathan and Lina became staunch Zionists. He built soup kitchens for the aged and the blind and the physically defective in 1917. He supported workrooms so that unskilled laborers could find employment. He built health stations which ministered to the victims of malaria and trachoma. He believed strongly in palliative care. He provided $250,000 for the establishment of the Jerusalem Health Center and made possible the founding of a Pasteur Institute. He lent moral and material support to the farmers and colonists of Israel and labored {{in the interests of the}} Hebrew University.|$|E

2500|$|In 1972, he {{completed}} Solaris, {{an adaptation of}} the novel Solaris by Stanisław Lem. He had worked on this together with screenwriter Fridrikh Gorenshtein as early as 1968. The film {{was presented at the}} Cannes Film Festival, won the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury and the FIPRESCI prize, and was nominated for the Palme d'Or. From 1973 to 1974, he shot the film Mirror, a highly autobiographical and unconventionally structured film drawing on his childhood and incorporating some of his father's poems. Tarkovsky had worked on the screenplay for this film since 1967, under the consecutive titles Confession, White day and A white, white day. From the beginning the film was not well received by Soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature. Russian authorities placed the film in the [...] "third category," [...] a severely limited distribution, and only allowed it to be shown in third-class cinemas and workers' clubs. Few prints were made and the film-makers received no returns. Third category films also placed the film-makers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds, which could have serious effects on their future productivity. These difficulties are presumed to have made Tarkovsky play with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> abroad and producing a film outside the Soviet film industry.|$|E
2500|$|As {{suggested}} by the reviewer's reference to a [...] "recent controversy", the Spanish–American War was only recent history when The Mystery of the Sea was published in 1902. The Spanish–American War began in 1897 with America's involvement in the Cuban insurrection against Spain. Cuban revolutionaries had begun fighting Spanish rule in 1895, and Spanish troops were sent to Cuba, where they set up camps known as reconcentrados, meant to contain the rebels. Conditions in these camps were very poor, and they became fodder for [...] "yellow journalism" [...] in the United States, provoking sympathy and outrage {{on behalf of the}} Cubans. Many American politicians supported <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> to war, and some even wanted to annex Cuba to the United States. Tensions with Spain intensified upon the publication of a letter from the Spanish minister that insulted President William McKinley, calling him weak. However, the event leading up to the war that caused the greatest public uproar and bears particular significance to The Mystery of the Sea was the explosion of the battleship Maine in Havana in 1898. This caused an outpouring of public sentiment against the Spanish, even though the explosion was most likely not the result of a vicious attack. Popular headlines and slogans like [...] "Remember the Maine, to Hell with Spain" [...] suggest that the character Marjory's attitude is a representation of the broader American public attitude during the Spanish–American War, and adds significance to her decision to use her fortune to buy a battleship for the U.S. Navy to use against the Spanish.|$|E
