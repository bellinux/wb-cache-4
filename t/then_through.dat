5|$|Beatty's first {{newspaper}} was the Beatty Bullfrog Miner, which began publishing in 1905 {{and went out}} of business in 1909. The Rhyolite Herald was the region's most important paper, starting in 1905 and reaching a circulation of 10,000 by 1909. It ceased publication in 1912, and the Beatty area had no newspaper from then until 1947. The Beatty Bulletin, a supplement to the Goldfield News, was published from <b>then</b> <b>through</b> 1956.|$|E
5|$|Dolan {{brought in}} Paul Tomlinson, Brian Mitchell and Lee Sinnott {{in a bid}} to help McCall and Hendrie realise their dreams with City. They mounted a {{promotion}} challenge in 1987–88 and were top for much of the season until they faltered in the New Year. When promotion was missed initially by one point {{on the last day of}} the season after a 3–2 defeat against Ipswich Town and <b>then</b> <b>through</b> play-off defeat to Middlesbrough, McCall left the club, signing for Everton for £850,000 in June 1988. He had played 238 league games for the club, scoring 37 goals, and in total played 285 games, scoring 46 goals. McCall was later outspoken in his autobiography, The Real McCall, about City's failure to strengthen the side to secure promotion.|$|E
5|$|During {{periods of}} low demand gas {{is taken from}} the National Transmission System (NTS) at Beltoft, North Lincolnshire and {{transferred}} via a 12-inch diameter 15km pipeline to the Lindholme Compression Site. Here gas is heated in a water bath heater <b>then</b> <b>through</b> a pressure let-down skid and via a 16-inch 1.5km pipeline to the Hatfield Moor well site for injection into the reservoir for storage. The sandstone reservoir has a capacity of about 4.1 billion cubic feet (116 million cubic metres). During periods of high demand gas is withdrawn from the reservoir and through the 16-inch pipeline to the Lindholme site. Here the gas is dehydrated with glycol and compressed using a gas-turbine driven compressor to a pressure suitable for export to Beltoft and into the NTS.|$|E

5|$|Fish ovaries may be {{of three}} types: gymnovarian, {{secondary}} gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the oocytes are released directly into the coelomic cavity and then enter the ostium, <b>then</b> <b>through</b> the oviduct and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed ova into the coelom from which they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the oviduct. Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in lungfish, sturgeon, and bowfin. Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct. Secondary gymnovaries are found in salmonids {{and a few other}} teleosts.|$|E
5|$|Following the rebels' rout at Deir al-Ghusun on 14 July, Ibrahim Pasha's troops {{proceeded}} to Nablus unhindered, passing through Arraba, the loyalist stronghold of the Abd al-Hadi family, and <b>then</b> <b>through</b> Sanur, the throne village of the Jarrar clan. When they entered Nablus on 15 July, no resistance was put up, and shortly afterward, {{the rest of}} Jabal Nablus submitted to Muhammad Ali's troops. For the most part, due to the loyalty of the Abd al-Hadi's to Muhammad Ali, and the neutrality of the powerful Nimr clan, {{the inhabitants of the}} city of Nablus had not participated in the revolt. From Nablus, Ibrahim Pasha dispatched his troops north to occupy Jenin and Nazareth, before arriving in Jerusalem on 20 July with 30,000 new conscripts.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{successful}} camp, Baden-Powell went on an extensive speaking tour arranged by his publisher, Pearsons, {{to promote his}} forthcoming Scouting for Boys, which officially began the Scout movement. It initially appeared as six fortnightly installments, beginning in January 1908, and later appeared in book form. Scouting began to spread throughout Great Britain and Ireland, <b>then</b> <b>through</b> {{the countries of the}} British Empire, and soon {{to the rest of the}} world. A reunion of the original campers was held in 1928 at the Chief Scout's home at Pax Hill in Hampshire.|$|E

25|$|The {{human eye}} {{functions}} by focusing light onto {{a layer of}} photoreceptor cells called the retina, which forms the inner lining {{of the back of}} the eye. The focusing is accomplished by a series of transparent media. Light entering the eye passes first through the cornea, which provides much of the eye's optical power. The light <b>then</b> continues <b>through</b> the fluid just behind the cornea—the anterior chamber, <b>then</b> passes <b>through</b> the pupil. The light <b>then</b> passes <b>through</b> the lens, which focuses the light further and allows adjustment of focus. The light <b>then</b> passes <b>through</b> the main body of fluid in the eye—the vitreous humour, and reaches the retina. The cells in the retina line the back of the eye, except for where the optic nerve exits; this results in a blind spot.|$|R

5|$|Heated-{{manifold}} direct-injection die casting, {{also known}} as direct-injection die casting or runnerless die casting, is a zinc die casting process where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold and <b>then</b> <b>through</b> heated mini-nozzles, which lead into the molding cavity. This process has the advantages of lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of sprues, gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles.|$|E
5|$|One of Edward's {{persistent}} challenges {{through most}} of his reign was a shortage of money; of the debts he inherited from his father, around £60,000 was still owing in the 1320s. The King {{worked his way through}} many treasurers and other financial officials, few of whom stayed long, raising revenues through often unpopular taxes, and requisitioning goods using his right of prise. He also took out many loans, first through the Frescobaldi family, and <b>then</b> <b>through</b> his banker Antonio Pessagno. Edward took a strong interest in financial matters towards the end of his reign, distrusting his own officials and attempting to increase revenues directly by cutting back on the expenses of his own household.|$|E

The Parrett flows through Langport and <b>then</b> <b>through</b> Middle Moor, Aller Moor to Burrowbridge where it is joined by the River Tone. It then passes through Earlake Moor, Hartlake Moor, Weston Level and South Moor. It continues north through Bridgwater, Horsey Level, past Pawlett Ham and Pawlett Level to the coast near Burnham-on-Sea.|$|E

During the three-year journey, the explorers visited New Zealand, the Tonga islands, New Caledonia, Tahiti, the Marquesas Islands and Easter Island. They went further south than anybody before them, almost discovering Antarctica. The journey conclusively disproved the Terra Australis Incognita theory, which claimed there was a big, habitable continent in the South.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} individual {{training at}} Ingleburn, the battalion moved on foot to Bathurst to complete collective training. Following this, the 2/17th embarked for the Middle East from Sydney on 20 October 1940, {{on board the}} Queen Mary. Moving in convoy the Queen Mary briefly stopped in Fremantle, before continuing to Bombay in early November where the battalion was disembarked. Following {{a few days in}} camp ashore they were transferred to the Rohna for the next leg of the voyage. The convoy continued, sailing via the African coast into the Gulf of Aden and <b>then</b> <b>through</b> the Suez Canal, before finally berthing at El Kantara in Egypt. The battalion was assigned to the 20th Brigade, along with the 2/13th and 2/15th Battalions, which were initially allocated to the 7th Division; however, following its arrival in the Middle East in November 1940, the battalion was transferred {{along with the rest of}} the brigade to the 9th Division.|$|E
5|$|After {{the capture}} of Lae, the Japanese high command {{determined}} that a withdrawal to {{a new line of}} defence was required. A total of about 9,000 Japanese troops subsequently began withdrawing across the Busu River and <b>then</b> <b>through</b> the Saruwaged and Finisterre Ranges to the north-east coast, while efforts were made to reinforce the Huon Peninsula, with the 20th Division being transferred from Madang to Finschhafen. The Allies, who had captured a copy of Nakano's withdrawal order when troops from the 2/25th Infantry Battalion clashed with a Japanese force on 13 September, attempted to cut off the withdrawing troops and subsequently there were heavy clashes along the Markham Valley Road, with troops from the Australian 25th Infantry Brigade and 503rd PIR engaged. During the withdrawal many Japanese troops ran short of food and abandoned essential equipment, including artillery, small arms and load carriage equipment; they subsequently reached their objective in the middle of October, having lost a further 600 to 1,000 men on the march. Japanese strength returns indicated that the 51st Division had 6,417 men, of whom 1,271 were sick. The 9th Division lost 77 killed, 397 wounded and 73 missing.|$|E
