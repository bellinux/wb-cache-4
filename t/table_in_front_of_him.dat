500|$|Several {{witnesses}} later {{reported that}} they heard a loud gunshot at approximately 15:30. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, opened the study door with Bormann at his side. Linge later stated that he immediately noted a scent of burnt almonds, which is a common observation {{in the presence of}} prussic acid (the aqueous form of hydrogen cyanide). Hitler's adjutant, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Günsche, entered the study and found the two lifeless bodies on the sofa. Eva, with her legs drawn up, was to Hitler's left and slumped away from him. Günsche stated that Hitler [...] "... sat... sunken over, with blood dripping out of his right temple. He had shot himself with his own pistol, a Walther PPK 7.65". The gun lay at his feet and according to SS-Oberscharführer Rochus Misch, Hitler's head was lying on the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Blood dripping from Hitler's right temple and chin had made a large stain on the right arm of the sofa and was pooling on the carpet. According to Linge, Eva's body had no visible physical wounds, and her face showed how she had died—by cyanide poisoning. Günsche and SS-Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke stated [...] "unequivocally" [...] that all outsiders and those performing duties and work in the bunker [...] "did not have any access" [...] to Hitler's private living quarters during the time of death (between 15:00 and 16:00).|$|E
2500|$|Officer's skat (German: [...] ) is {{a variant}} for two players. Each player gets 16 {{cards on the}} <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> 8 facing down and 8 {{on top of each}} of them with face shown. Bidding is {{replaced}} by declaring a game type and trump by the companion. When a top card is played, the hidden card is uncovered, making a total of 16 tricks in that game. Scoring is like normal skat.|$|E
2500|$|Starting {{with the}} {{player on the}} dealer's left, each player in turn lays one card face up on the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> or her, stating the count—that is, the {{cumulative}} value of the cards that have been laid (for example, the first player lays a five and says [...] "five", the next lays a six and says [...] "eleven", and so on)—without the count going above 31. The cards are not laid in {{the centre of the}} table as, {{at the end of the}} [...] "play," [...] each player needs to pick up the cards they have laid.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{thunder of}} applause. A ballot box was brought {{and placed on}} a <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the platform.|$|R

2500|$|Sun Quan responded, [...] "The old villain has harboured the {{intention}} of usurping the Han dynasty for a long time, but he feared the two Yuans (Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu), Lü Bu, Liu Biao and me. Now, all the others have been destroyed and I'm the only one left. The old villain and me cannot coexist together. Your idea of going to war coincides closely with my thoughts. This {{is a sign that}} Heaven has granted you to me." [...] He then drew his sword, slashed the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and said, [...] "Any of you who dares to speak of surrendering to Cao Cao shall end up like this table!" ...|$|E
60|$|Selingman {{tapped on}} the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> with his pudgy forefinger.|$|E
60|$|He {{laid the}} woodman's tool on the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> {{and began to}} rip up and unwrap the curious linen {{covering}} round the handle.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Andelsen {{shook hands}} and {{accepted}} a chair. Upon the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the captain was the sealed dispatch box. Crawshay had a suggestion to make.|$|R

6000|$|Dick {{went and}} {{returned}} presently with an ink-horn, {{a roll of}} parchment, pens and a little table. Then Hugh sat himself down on the altar rail, placing the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|He leaned forward, {{pencil in}} hand, {{to make a}} note of the figure Morrison should name, when the {{drunkard}} approached and struck the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> with his fist, and blazed upon Bartley's face, suddenly uplifted, with his blue crazy eyes: ...|$|E
60|$|The lad's assurance, which, {{so far and}} no further, did {{duty for}} courage, deserted him. He was evidently not {{prepared}} to be made the subject of another court-martial, and the hand he laid on the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> trembled a little.|$|E
50|$|The game {{revolves}} around {{two types of}} cards: Actions, which are discarded when played, and Things, which remain in play on the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> whoever played them.|$|R
60|$|The <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> her {{was cleared}} now. People were {{beginning}} to consider their next coup. The voice of the croupier, with his parrot-like cry, travelled down the board.|$|R
60|$|That {{night the}} Captain {{called me to}} his cabin. He had a book <b>of</b> {{mathematical}} <b>tables</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him, and great sheets of vulgar fractions littered the floor on all sides.|$|R
60|$|Erickson paused. He {{licked his}} thick lips, his eyes blank and lidded, like a toad's. At last {{he rubbed his}} mouth with his hand and reached down, lifting up the sample case. He {{set it on the}} <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then {{he thrust}} {{his hand into}} his {{trousers}} pocket and, without the least attempt at concealment, produced and plumped upon the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> the pearl necklace which {{only a few minutes}} before I had seen upon the neck of Lady Orstline.|$|E
60|$|Stephen {{withdrew the}} pipe {{from his mouth}} and dealt the black oak <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> a blow with his great fist.

60|$|Scheih Ibrahim {{spread the}} <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a sofa, {{and all three}} ate together. When they had {{finished}} eating Noureddin asked the old man to bring them a bottle of wine.|$|R
60|$|The casques {{were the}} first pieces that came to view. Albert carried his to his father, while Aline placed Edgar's on the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> Dame Agatha. The knight {{examined}} it carefully.|$|R
60|$|He {{crossed the}} room and, opening a desk, sat down {{at it for a}} minute or two. Then he came back and laid a strip of paper on the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> Florence.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{know what}} I think also," [...] shouted her enraged parent, dashing the new, crape-covered hat {{on to the}} <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "and {{it is that the}} further you and I are apart from each other, the better we are likely to get on." ...|$|E
60|$|Wrayson lunched at {{the club}} that morning, and {{received}} a warm greeting from his friends. The subject of the murder was, as though by common consent, avoided. Towards {{the end of the}} meal the Colonel received a telegram, which he read and laid down upon the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{appearance}} of {{a slip of paper}} in Cannister's hand, and a few shillings lying on the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> denoted that the business had been transacted, and the tenor of their conversation went to show that a summary of village news was now engaging the attention of parishioner and parson.|$|E
50|$|On the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the Earl is {{a pile of}} {{gold and}} bills of {{exchange}} - the bride's dowry just handed {{to him by the}} bespectacled alderman, who is scrutinising the marriage contract.|$|R
60|$|CONSCIENCE (at last; in an acid voice): That is {{a history}} of the Peloponnesian War by Thucydides on the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> you. I thought I would mention it, in case you had forgotten.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{could not}} have asked a better person,' {{answered}} Jack cheerfully. And signing to him {{to sit down with}} him under a tree, he set the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> them, and struck it three times, crying: ...|$|R
60|$|Nobody {{appeared}} to notice him. He so seldom came to London {{these days that}} he was practically a stranger in the club; {{and in any case}} your Senior Conservative, when at lunch, has little leisure for observing anything not immediately on the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> To attract attention in the dining-room of the Senior Conservative Club between the hours of one and two-thirty, {{you have to be a}} mutton chop--not an earl.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{you ought}} to do," [...] said Archie, [...] "is {{to let me go}} and see him, taking the stuff in {{crackling}} bills. I'll roll them about on the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> That'll fetch him!" [...] He prodded Mr. Brewster encouragingly with a roll. [...] "I'll tell you what to do. Give me three thousand of the best and crispest, and I'll undertake to buy that shop. It can't fail, laddie!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, and {{her aunt}} stood still, {{apparently}} lost in contemplation, after {{the door swung}} softly to. Then she {{sat down at the}} writing table. There was very little in the note, but an hour after Dane received it that night, a wagon drew up outside Ferris's farm. Two men went quietly in and found the owner of the homestead sitting with a sheaf of papers scattered about the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "At the theatres, eh?" [...] sighed the Countess. [...] "At the cafés-concerts, at {{the little}} <b>tables</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the doors? Quelle existence! You know I am a Parisienne, monsieur," [...] she added, [...] "to my fingertips." ...|$|R

60|$|Signing to the assistants, the Valaisan now quietly {{awaited the}} effect of a new experiment. The pall was removed, and the body of Jacques Colis exposed. He was seated as in life, on the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the grand altar.|$|R
