During the events of Blood-C, Saya Kisaragi fights Elder Bairns attacking her village. It is eventually revealed that Saya is an Elder Bairn barred from drinking human blood by an oath—captured by Fumito Nanahara, head of the organization that supervises Shrovetide, she entered a wager in which she would subject herself to an experiment, with her prize being the reneging of her oath. The experiment fails, and everyone involved is massacred aside from Fumito, his ally Yūka Amino, and Saya herself. Betrayed by Fumito, Saya swears vengeance against him. By <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> Dark, Fumito—operating through his covert group Tower and its puppet corporation Seventh Heaven—has gained control of Tokyo's government and implemented the Youth Ordinance Bill, a law which enforces curfews for minors and regulates the use of the internet.|$|E

Richard is gravely injured from an enemy's arrow. He is brought to Nicci, a sorceress and former Sister of the Dark, who heals him using Subtractive Magic; this causes unforeseen events to spiral out of control. When Richard awakens, he discovers that his wife, Kahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor, is missing. Furthermore, no one around him seems to remember her. Nicci and Cara both attribute Richard's memory of Kahlan to dreams and delusions brought on by his injury and possibly an unintended effect of the Subtractive Magic used in healing Richard. Despite Richard's attempts to explain <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> several years could not have happened without Kahlan, the paradoxes are explained away as Richard remembering things inaccurately.|$|E
500|$|The Times, {{generally}} pro-Conservative, {{had backed}} Butler, {{and called it}} [...] "prodigal" [...] of the party to pass over his many talents. The paper praised Home as [...] "an outstandingly successful Foreign Secretary", but doubted his grasp of domestic affairs, his modernising instincts and his suitability [...] "to carry the Conservative Party through a fierce and probably dirty campaign" [...] at the general election due within a year. The Guardian, liberal in its political outlook, remarked that Home [...] "does not look like the man to impart force and purpose to his Cabinet and the country" [...] and suggested that he seemed too frail politically to be even a stop-gap. The Observer, another liberal-minded paper, said, [...] "The overwhelming– and damaging– impression left by <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> two weeks is that the Tories {{have been forced to}} settle for a second-best....

Eidos believed The Angel of Darkness would benefit from additional marketing support from , the sequel to the [...] Despite the delays, the company pushed Core Design to release the game {{in time for the}} marketing support. In order to meet the deadline, areas of the game containing key narrative elements had to be cut; one of the losses was the explanation of how the character survived <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> Revelation. Among other concepts that needed to be cut were two further locations, character animations, sound bites, and unique gameplay elements involving Kurtis. Some completed environmental assets also ended up being cut by mistake. Some of those elements were also deliberately left out by the team, who wished to bring them into future games. The team at Core Design later said that they felt Eidos forced them to get the game out before it was ready. The game was also reportedly submitted eight times to Sony before its release. The game went gold on 18 June 2003, two days before its original release date, although there was some confusion as the game had reportedly gone gold on 2 June. The game was finally released in the summer of 2003, alongside The Cradle of Life.|$|E
