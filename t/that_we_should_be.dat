Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognizes that {{the interpretation of the}} creation story is difficult, and remarks <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> willing to change our mind about it as new information comes up.|$|E
500|$|At {{a meeting}} with Finerman, Frankel {{told her that he}} thought the story {{unnecessarily}} punished Miranda. [...] "My view was <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> grateful for excellence. Why do the excellent people have to be nice?" [...] He prepared to move on and consider more scripts. Two days later his manager persuaded him to reconsider and look for something he liked that he could shape the film into. He took the job, giving Finerman extensive notes on the script and laying out a detailed vision for the film.|$|E
500|$|In June 1999, United {{accepted}} {{an offer from}} the FA {{to withdraw from the}} FA Cup in order to participate in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship, staged in Brazil. It was criticised by the new Sports minister Kate Hoey, who suggested the club were treating its supporters in a [...] "shabby way". Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson however replied that United had been pressurised to make the decision, which aimed to solidify England's 2006 FIFA World Cup bid: [...] "The Government are saying <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> in the FA Cup, but they are the very people that were saying originally that {{we have to go to}} Brazil. They could tell us quite clearly: 'Do not bother about the World Cup bid, leave that to us. It should not be Manchester United's responsibility.'" ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to assembly of weapons, the AFSWP supported nuclear weapons testing. For Operation Sandstone in 1948, Groves ordered Dorland to fill every possible job with his men. He did this {{so well that}} Strauss, now an AEC commissioner, became disturbed {{at the number of}} AFSWP personnel who were participating, and feared that the Soviet Union might launch a sneak attack on Enewetak to wipe out the nation's ability to assemble nuclear weapons. The successful testing in Operation Sandstone was a major leap forward. The new Mark 4 nuclear bomb that the AEC began delivering in 1949 was a production design that was much easier to assemble and maintain, and enabled a bomb assembly team to be reduced to just 46 men. Kenneth D. Nichols, the wartime commander of the Manhattan District, now [...] "recommended <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> thinking in terms of thousands of weapons rather than hundreds." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{successful}} {{testing of}} the new cores in the Sandstone tests had a profound effect. Practically every component of the old weapons was rendered obsolete. Even before the third test had been carried out, Bradbury had halted production of the old cores, and ordered that all effort was to be concentrated on the Mark 4 nuclear bomb, which would become the first mass-produced nuclear weapon. The more efficient use of fissionable material would increase the nuclear stockpile from 56 bombs in June 1948 to 169 in June 1949. The Mark III bombs were withdrawn from service in 1950. At the same time, new production plants were coming online and the Wigner effect problem had been solved. By May 1951, plutonium production was twelve times that of 1947, while uranium-235 production had increased eight-fold. The Chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, Major General Kenneth D. Nichols, saw clearly that the era of scarcity was over. He now [...] "recommended <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{thinking in terms of}} thousands of weapons rather than hundreds." ...|$|E
500|$|The actress led {{an active}} private life, {{reportedly}} swimming and playing tennis every morning. In her eighties {{she was still}} playing tennis regularly, as indicated in her 1993 documentary All About Me. She also enjoyed painting, which became a passion later in life. When questioned about politics, Hepburn told an interviewer, [...] "I always just say be on the affirmative and liberal side. Don't be a 'no' person." [...] The anti-Communist attitude in 1940s Hollywood prompted her to political activity, as she joined the Committee for the First Amendment. Her name was mentioned at the hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee but Hepburn denied being a Communist sympathizer. Later in life, she openly promoted birth control and supported abortion. She practiced Albert Schweitzer's theory of [...] "Reverence for Life", but {{did not believe in}} religion or the afterlife. In 1991, Hepburn told a journalist, [...] "I'm an atheist, and that's it. I believe there's nothing we can know except <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> kind to each other and do what we can for other people." [...] Her public declarations of these beliefs led the American Humanist Association to award her the Humanist Arts Award in 1985.|$|E

Rubin argues, [...] "Orwell claimed <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{attentive}} {{to how the}} use of language has limited our capacity for critical thought just as we should be equally concerned with {{the ways in which}} dominant modes of thinking have reshaped the very language that we use." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{the nuclear}} test, MacKay also {{condemned}} a North Korean missile test in July 2006, and called the country a major threat for {{the stability of the}} East Asian region. Harper stated that, [...] "the fact that (North Korea) is prepared to arm itself and prepared to threaten to use such armaments... is something <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> gravely concerned about" ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the inquiry}} he {{repeatedly}} berated the politicians conducting it, and the government. When {{asked about his}} company's tax minimisation schemes, he replied: [...] "Of course I am minimising my tax.

2500|$|In 2012, in {{an article}} in Al-Quds Al-Arabi newspaper, Ahmed Qurei called for Palestinians to reconsider a one-state instead of a two-state solution.

2500|$|ElBaradei {{described}} the U.S. invasion of Iraq as [...] "a glaring example of how, in many cases, {{the use of}} force exacerbates the problem rather than [...] it." [...] ElBaradei further stated that [...] "we learned from Iraq that an inspection takes time, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> patient, that an inspection can, in fact, work," [...] and that he had [...] "been validated" [...] in concluding that Saddam Hussein had not revived his nuclear weapons program.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{economists and}} observers, {{including}} conservatives, {{have argued that}} this focus on inflation and failure to recognize the risk of deflation significantly exacerbated the crisis. In his memoir, Chairman Bernanke writes about his frustration, [...] "I vented in an email {{the next day to}} Don Kohn: 'I find myself conciliating holders of the unreasonable opinion <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> tightening even as the economy and financial system are in a precarious position and inflation/commodity pressures appear to be easing.'" ...|$|E

[...] Akin's opponent in the Senate campaign, Senator Claire McCaskill, said, [...] "It is beyond comprehension that someone can be so ignorant about the emotional and physical trauma brought on by rape". Democratic members started a petition to remove Akin from the science committee.|$|E

60|$|I {{was some}} {{time of my}} partner's opinion; but after a little more serious thinking, I told him, I {{thought it was a}} very great hazard for us to attempt {{returning}} to Bengal, for <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were {{on the wrong side of}} the Straits of Malacca; and that if the alarm <b>was</b> given, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> sure to be waylaid on every side, as well by the Dutch of Batavia, as the English elsewhere; <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> taken, as it <b>were,</b> running away, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> even condemn ourselves, and there would want no more evidence to destroy us.

2500|$|According to Horney we {{can have}} two views of our self: the [...] "real self" [...] and the [...] "ideal self". The real self is who and what we {{actually}} are. [...] The ideal self {{is the type of}} person we feel <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be.</b> The real self has the potential for growth, happiness, will power, realization of gifts, etc., but it also has deficiencies. The ideal self is used as a model to assist the real self in developing its potential and achieving self-actualization. (Engler 125) But {{it is important to know}} the differences between our ideal and real self.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were three}} {{casualties}} {{lying in the}} garden of Government House. You think: What sort of mood {{are they going to be}} in when their [...] are shot up? When we were actually lying down I felt a bit humiliated but I also felt apprehensive about what was going to happen next. One of the Argentine officers came along and actually struck one of the guards and told us to stand up. We stood up and he shook my hand and a few other guys' hands and said that we shouldn't lie down, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> proud of what we'd done." ...|$|E
