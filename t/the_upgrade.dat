40|$|In <b>the</b> <b>upgraded</b> Large Hadron Collider (LHC) {{environment}} {{the energy}} and luminosity will approximately double, and the Level- 1 trigger (L 1) rate will increase six-fold. This increase cannot be accommodated using current methods at the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector. Also, increased levels of ionizing radiation may interfere with muon endcap electronics. Unreliable performance of the L 1 and endcap electronics can compromise physics studies. To determine if <b>the</b> <b>upgraded</b> electronics will function in the improved LHC environment, an irradiation study of <b>the</b> <b>upgraded</b> Muon Port Card (MPC) is performed. Additionally, Global Muon Trigger (GMT) muon isolation using <b>the</b> <b>upgraded</b> Muon Sorter (MS) is presented to reduce the L 1 rate. It is determined that <b>the</b> <b>upgraded</b> MPC will operate properly, and that GMT muon isolation alone is not a viable method of rate reduction. Therefore, <b>the</b> MPC <b>upgrade</b> and GMT muon isolation will be implemented in <b>the</b> <b>upgraded</b> CMS detector...|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} quality of fast {{pyrolysis}} bio-oil, an efficient catalytic upgrading process is proposed with pristine Ni/MgO catalyst and ethanol. Esterification, hydrogenation, alkylation of aromatic ring and depolymerization of lignin -derived pyrolytic oligomers simultaneously occurred in <b>the</b> <b>upgrading</b> process. Esters, ketones and alkyl -substituted aromatic compounds were found to be the main components in the volatile fraction of <b>the</b> <b>upgraded</b> bio-oil. Under <b>the</b> optimal conditions, pH value and HHV (high heating value) of <b>the</b> <b>upgraded</b> bio-oil were 5. 01 and 24. 9 MJ kg(- 1), respectively. This result suggested that the properties of bio-oil could be effectively improved by <b>the</b> catalytic <b>upgrading</b> process. Moreover, carbon efficiency of this upgrading process was relatively high because that formation of coke is suppressed in <b>the</b> <b>upgrading</b> process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|By 2005, {{ridership}} {{had increased}} to 2.5 million per year, up 278% from 1991, giving a 7% {{market share in}} the corridor. To further increase capacity and regularity, the Norwegian National Rail Administration decided to rebuild the section from Stavanger to Sandnes to double track. At the same time, a new freight terminal was to be built at Ganddal, meaning that the section would only have to be shared with intercity trains. <b>The</b> <b>upgrade</b> involved closing Hillevåg Station, and building three new stations: Paradis, Jåttåvågen and Gausel. Construction was started in 2006 and {{was estimated to be}} completed by 2009. It was estimated to cost 2.2 billion Norwegian krone. From April to November 2009, the section from Ganddal to Stavanger was closed while the last part of <b>the</b> <b>upgrade</b> was completed. The new line was opened on 16 November 2009 and from 14 December, the 15-minute headway was introduced between Stavanger and Sandnes.|$|E

5|$|An upper-level {{anticyclone}} {{north of}} the system provided a more favorable environment for organization, allowing the convection to organize into banding features.

Early on June3, the nearby anticyclone moved northeastward, which increased wind shear over the system and caused it briefly to become less-organized. However, convection increased over the center, and at 1500UTC on June3 the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Two-E about 140mi (240km) southwest of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero; <b>the</b> <b>upgrade</b> was due to the system developing sufficiently organized convection, as well as a closed surface circulation.|$|E
