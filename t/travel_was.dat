5|$|After {{the storm}} made landfall, flash flood watches and {{warnings}} were issued for numerous areas in eastern Texas. <b>Travel</b> <b>was</b> discouraged {{due to the}} threat of flash flood. During the flood event, the National Weather Service in Houston issued 99 flash flood warnings with an average lead time of 40minutes; only nine warnings were false alarms.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Space <b>Travel</b> <b>was</b> fully ported to the PDP-7, Thompson had {{expanded}} his software suite to a full, basic operating system, {{in a way}} he had been unable to with the Multics project and the GE 635. The operating system he designed spread to other users in the company, and formed the core of what would be named in 1970 the Unix operating system. Space <b>Travel</b> <b>was</b> one of the early mainframe games developed before the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early history of video games, and was never distributed beyond its initial locations. As a result, it had no effect on future video games, and its primary legacy is that of sparking the creation of Unix.|$|E

5|$|During {{the initial}} {{settlement}} {{period of the}} Niagara area, following the American Revolutionary War, new wagon routes were built over native footpaths. Grimsby and Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake) quickly became established settlements, but <b>travel</b> <b>was</b> cumbersome between them. Pioneers were forced to travel south along the Niagara Road to Queenston, where they turned west and followed the Iroquois Road.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{political}} developments {{made it difficult}} to hold large organised rallies at the site. Catalan political gatherings were banned during the 1923–1930 dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, <b>travel</b> <b>was</b> difficult during the 1936–1939 Spanish Civil War, and political gatherings were again banned during (and for some time after) the Franco dictatorship of 1939–1975.|$|E
5|$|Although some {{preparatory work}} was carried out, the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939 brought the electrification north of Rickmansworth to a halt. First class <b>travel</b> <b>was</b> abandoned by the LPTB, along with the Pullman cars, and the line was operated entirely as a shuttle service. In 1940 the Chesham branch was converted to autotrain working, in which the trains could be driven from each end, thus avoiding the time-consuming repositioning of the locomotive. LNER C13 Class locomotives were used for this push-pull working, along with two three-car sets of antiquated Ashbury passenger cars dating from 1898.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Longwang made landfall, 37shelters opened across the island, {{accommodating}} nearly 1,000people. Additionally, 5,464Chinese fishermen temporarily sheltered at Taiwanese ports. All airports were closed on October2 and sea <b>travel</b> <b>was</b> suspended. With international airports shut down, President Chen, who was {{returning from a}} visit to the United Arab Emirates, was forced to land in Indonesia. The landing in Indonesia was seen as a political breakthrough for Taiwan as Indonesia does not recognize them as a separate nation from China.|$|E

Reviewers also noted technical issues with moving Marston's character, especially when climbing ladders and outrunning zombies.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{invention}} of the electric telegraph in 1835 that the modern age of weather forecasting began. Before that, the fastest that distant weather reports could <b>travel</b> <b>was</b> around 100 miles per day (160km/d), but was more typically 40–75 miles per day (60–120km/day) (whether by land or by sea). By the late 1840s, the telegraph allowed reports of weather conditions from a wide area to be received almost instantaneously, allowing forecasts to be made from knowledge of weather conditions further upwind.|$|E

5|$|The {{low level}} station {{remained}} open, although passenger numbers at that station also fell {{after the fire}} of 1936 and many services were diverted to serve London–Croydon routes instead of the Victoria–London Bridge route. Rail <b>travel</b> <b>was</b> in decline across the UK in the 1960s and 1970s when the Beeching Axe was imposed. During the 1970s, two outer platforms used by terminating trains were abandoned and the third rail was removed.|$|E
5|$|The medieval aristocratic {{household}} was not {{fixed to}} one location, {{but could be}} more or less permanently on the move. Greater nobles would have estates scattered over large geographical areas, and to maintain proper control of all their possessions it was important to physically inspect the localities on a regular basis. As the master of the horses, <b>travel</b> <b>was</b> the responsibility of the marshal. Everything in the noble household was designed for travel, so that the lord could enjoy the same luxury wherever he went.|$|E
5|$|With {{the trilogy}} complete, Puccini {{had to decide}} on {{a place for the}} premiere. In 1918, <b>travel</b> <b>was</b> risky and uncertain.

He finally agreed that the premiere could take place at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, without his being there, on the basis of performing instructions which he supplied to the conductor. Gianni Schicchi proved to be the last opera completed by Puccini.|$|E

5|$|Before Joy struck Australia, {{residents}} {{evacuated from}} resorts on Fitzroy and Green islands by boat or plane. Officials set up evacuation centres {{on the mainland}} and put the Australian Army on standby. The military evacuated its fleet of Blackhawk helicopters inland from RAAF Base Townsville. A man required rescue from Hope Island by helicopter {{in advance of the}} storm. The threat of the storm caused shopping malls and the airport near Cairns to close just before Christmas. Several flights were diverted or delayed, stranding about 1,000travellers, many of whom spent Christmas in the airport. Road <b>travel</b> <b>was</b> banned in some areas of northeastern Queensland, and residents in Port Douglas were forced to evacuate. The Flood Warning Centre in Brisbane issued 192flood warnings related to Cyclone Joy in December and January, beginning on 23December. Most of the warnings were related to increased water levels along rivers.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{satisfactory}} inspection {{carried out by}} Major Marindin of the Board of Trade on 3 September 1892, the line between Paddock Wood and Hope Mill, for Goudhurst and Lamberhurst was opened to passenger and goods traffic nine days later. The first service drawn by Cudworth E1 class 2-4-0 No. 112 left Hope Mill at 08:25 and free <b>travel</b> <b>was</b> offered throughout the day. The official opening took place on 1 October 1892, and services were extended to Hawkhurst on 4 September 1893. The line was worked by the SER (soon to become the SECR) which formally absorbed the Cranbrook and Paddock Wood Railway on 29 January 1900.|$|E
5|$|In 1629, Isaac Beeckman {{proposed}} {{an experiment in}} which a person observes the flash of a cannon reflecting off a mirror about one mile (1.6km) away. In 1638, Galileo Galilei {{proposed an}} experiment, with an apparent claim to having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering a lantern and its perception some distance away. He was unable to distinguish whether light <b>travel</b> <b>was</b> instantaneous or not, but concluded that if it were not, it must nevertheless be extraordinarily rapid. In 1667, the Accademia del Cimento of Florence reported that it had performed Galileo's experiment, with the lanterns separated by about onemile, but no delay was observed. The actual delay in this experiment would have been about 11 microseconds.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, {{international}} rail <b>travel</b> <b>was</b> liberalised by new European Union directives, {{designed to}} break up monopolies {{in order to encourage}} competition for services between countries. This sparked interest among other companies in providing services in competition to Eurostar and new services to destinations beyond Paris and Brussels. The only rail carrier to formally propose and secure permission for such a service up to now is Deutsche Bahn, which intends to run services between London and Germany and the Netherlands. The sale of High Speed One by the British Government having effectively nationalised LCR in June 2009 is also likely to stimulate competition on the line.|$|E
5|$|In Britain the {{campaign}} emphasised the important lesson previously {{demonstrated in the}} Trafalgar campaign of the year before, that it was immensely difficult in {{the vastness of the}} Atlantic Ocean to detect and intercept French squadrons at sea: only off their own harbours and in the confined waters of the Caribbean were they vulnerable to detection and attack by British squadrons. The inadequate size and power of convoy escorts and the expense in resources employed in chasing French squadrons at sea meant that British trade was placed at risk by the depredations of independent French squadrons, and the maintenance of a tight blockade was essential. The British grip on French maritime <b>travel</b> <b>was</b> a constant source of irritation to Napoleon, who instigated a massive shipbuilding program with the intention of breaking the blockade: by 1808 he was able to muster over 80 ships of the line against the British blockade squadrons.|$|E
5|$|It rained for {{the next}} day and a half, {{preventing}} battle. During this time, Baum's men constructed a small redoubt at {{the crest of the hill}} and hoped that the weather would prevent the Americans from attacking before reinforcements arrived.

Reinforcements for both sides marched out on the 15th; <b>travel</b> <b>was</b> quite difficult due to the heavy rains.
