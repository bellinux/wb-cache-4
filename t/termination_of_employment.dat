5|$|Soon {{after the}} war ended in August 1945, Lieutenant Colonel Arthur V. Peterson, the Manhattan District officer with overall {{responsibility}} for the production of fissile material, recommended that the S-50 plant be placed on stand-by. The Manhattan District ordered the plant shut down on 4 September 1945. It was the only production-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant ever built, but its efficiency could not compete with that of a gaseous diffusion plant. The columns were drained and cleaned, and all employees were given two weeks' notice of impending <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b> All production had ceased by 9 September, and the last uranium hexafluoride feed was shipped to K-25 for processing. Layoffs began on 18 September. By this time, voluntary resignations had reduced the Fercleve payroll from its wartime peak of 1,600 workers to around 900. Only 241 remained at the end of September. Fercleve's contract was terminated on 31 October, and responsibility for the S-50 plant buildings was transferred to the K-25 office. Fercleve laid off the last employees on 16 February 1946.|$|E

25|$|Early {{retirement}} {{can be at}} any age, but {{is generally}} before the age (or tenure) needed for eligibility for support and funds from government or employer-provided sources. Thus, early-retirees rely on their own savings and investments to be initially self-supporting, until they start receiving such external support. Early retirement is also a euphemistic term for accepting <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> before retirement age {{as part of the}} employer's labor force rationalization.

25|$|The role {{of women}} in the Australian {{military}} began to change in the 1970s. In 1975, which was the International Year of Women, the service chiefs established a committee to explore opportunities for increased female participation in the military. This led to reforms which allowed women to deploy on active service in support roles, pregnancy no longer being grounds for automatic <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and changes to leave provisions. The WRAAF and WAAC were abolished in 1977 and 1979 respectively, with female soldiers being merged into the services. Equal pay was granted to servicewomen in 1979 and the WRANS was abolished in 1985.|$|E

40|$|As {{the title}} already suggests, this {{rigorous}} thesis {{is focused on}} the invalid <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> an <b>employment.</b> The aim is to answer questions of legal defects of the juridical act leading to the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> an <b>employment</b> relationship which are concerned with the recodification of the Czech private law made by the Act no. 89 / 2012 Coll., the Civil Code. The Civil Code as a lex generalis brought into the Czech legal order expressly provisions not only about invalid juridical acts, but also about putative juridical acts. These distinguishing consequences of defects of any juridical acts must be reflected in the matter <b>of</b> the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> an <b>employment</b> relationship. The crucial part of this rigorous thesis is therefore a description and analysis of defects of juridical acts in general and their specifics when terminating an employment relationship. Another equally important part is the analysis of the procedural context associated with the claiming for invalid or putative juridical acts aimed at <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> an <b>employment</b> relationship in the civil proceedings. This rigorous thesis provides a comprehensive view of the institutes of invalid and putative <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> an <b>employment</b> relationship in the context of applicable judicial decisions and even through a description of some practical situations [...] ...|$|R

25|$|In the April 19 episode, Perino read a {{prepared}} statement about O'Reilly's dismissal equivalent {{to what the}} network had released earlier in the day. The reasons for his firing and the sexual harassment allegations were {{not mentioned in the}} program itself. The <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> of the former host was a major feature of news coverage on both MSNBC and CNN; outside of the prepared statements, it was not mentioned on-air during the program and other regular topics were covered. The following day, images of the host were removed from the front windows of the News Corp. Building. O'Reilly was not given an opportunity to sign-off on-air, instead releasing a statement through his agency about the matter, while continuing to deny the sexual harassment allegations against him. During the final episode Gutfield spoke about the program's legacy and the loyalty of the show's staff after a segment with Tucker Carlson, followed by a fading of the stage's lighting to a dark state, revealing the set now blank of anything identifying the show.|$|E
25|$|In July 1919, Bortkevičienė {{returned}} to Kaunas. In April 1920, {{as a candidate}} of the Peasant Union, she {{was elected to the}} Constituent Assembly of Lithuania, but due to her busy schedule she refused the mandate. She {{became a member of the}} Constituent Assembly in January 1921 when she replaced deceased Juozas Lukoševičius. She helped to prepare the Statute of the University of Lithuania and Patient's Fund Law. The law was particularly important for women as it provided 6-week maternity leave and forbade <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> on grounds of pregnancy. During the Assembly sessions Bortkevičienė spoke rarely, but she voiced her opinions on two major issues: land reform and the institution of the president. She opposed returning land that was confiscated by the Tsarist regime from churches and monasteries. When discussing the constitution, she also opposed creating the institution of the president. Both of these measures passed by the votes of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party. In 1926, she ran in the parliamentary election as a candidate of the Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union. She was not elected to the Third Seimas of Lithuania, but she was nominated to the President of Lithuania. She received one vote.|$|E

2500|$|The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) {{has set the}} {{permissible}} {{exposure limit}} (PEL) at 1 ppm calculated as an eight-hour time weighted average (TWA) [...] and 5 ppm as a 15-minute excursion limit (EL).

2500|$|Union busting is a {{term used}} by media, labor organizations, and others to {{describe}} {{a wide range of}} activities undertaken to disrupt or prevent the formation of trade unions. [...] Union busting tactics can refer to both legal and illegal activities, and can range anywhere from subtle to violent. Labor laws differ greatly from country to country in both level and type of regulations in respect to their protection of unions, their organizing activities, as well as other aspects. These laws can affect topics such as posting notices, organizing on or off employer property, solicitations, card signing, union dues, picketing, work stoppages, striking and strikebreaking, lockouts, <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> permanent replacements, automatic recognition, derecognition, ballot elections, and employer-controlled trade unions. [...] Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) declares that everyone has a right to form and/or join a trade union. The provision is, however, not legally binding and has, in most jurisdictions, no horizontal effect in the legal relation between employer and employees or unions.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on a {{contractual}} freedom in employment relations, especially upon formation, changes and <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>employment</b> relationship. The contractual freedom is the key principle of private law, therefore also of labor law, and {{the expression of the}} contractual freedom is the freedom of an individual in his choice whether to enter into an employment relationship, who to enter with, what content would the employment relationship have and when and how to terminate this relationship. The contractual freedom upon formation, changes and <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> an <b>employment</b> relationship is necessary to be limited due to protection, safety and certainty of employees and also in the public interest. One of the objectives of this thesis is to think about how should be this restriction of the contractual freedom limited. In this work there is also a description of a historical development of a regulatory autonomy of the will of the parties and a description of a statutory regulation of the formation, changes and <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> an <b>employment</b> relationship. Another objective of this thesis is to reflect on the impact of extensive recodification of private law, that occurred in recent years, on the formation, changes and <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>employment</b> relationship.

2500|$|Since the Civil Rights Act of 1964, all {{employing}} entities {{and labor}} unions {{have a duty to}} treat employees equally, without discrimination based on [...] "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." [...] There are separate rules for sex discrimination in pay under the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Additional groups with [...] "protected status" [...] were added by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. There is no federal law banning all sexual orientation or identity discrimination, but 22 states had passed laws by 2016. These equality laws generally prevent discrimination in hiring, terms of employment, and make discharge because of a protected characteristic unlawful. There is no federal law against unjust discharge, and most states also have no law with full protection against wrongful <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b> Collective agreements made by labor unions and some individual contracts require people are only discharged for a [...] "just cause". The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 requires employing entities give 60 days notice if more than 50 or one third of the workforce may lose their jobs. Federal law has sought to reach full employment through monetary policy and spending on infrastructure. Trade policy has increasingly attempted to put labor rights in international agreements, to ensure open markets in a global economy do not undermine fair and full employment.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} {{just before the}} Supreme Court took up the Beck case, however, it {{elaborated}} on its previous agency fee rulings. [...] In Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U.S. 435 (1984), the Supreme Court concluded that the agency fee may only cover those activities {{directly related to the}} union's role as a collective bargaining representative. [...] These included national conventions (where dues levels were set and union programs debated and established), social activities (which enhanced union solidarity, especially during negotiations), grievance handling, contract negotiation costs, and union communications, but excluded union organizing activities. The Court in Ellis also wrestled with the issue of rebates, and concluded that a union could not simply rebate agency fees to workers for that would essentially constitute a forced, interest-free loan from the worker to the union. In 1985, the Court held in Pattern Makers v. NLRB, 473 U.S. 95 (1985), that a union member may resign at any time without notice. Thus, Pattern Makers further undermined the union shop by giving workers the right to resign from the union at any time and incur no penalty (such as <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment).</b> [...] The Court also crafted additional rules regarding agency fees in Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U.S. 292 (1986). In Teachers, the union had failed to minimize the risk that agency fees might be used for impermissible purposes and had failed to provide agency fee payers with adequate information about how the agency fee was calculated. Now the Supreme Court imposed a third requirement, that agency fee payers must be offered a timely, fair, and objective mechanism for challenging the computation of agency fees. The Court did uphold, however, the use of interest-bearing escrow accounts for holding disputed dues.|$|E
2500|$|Wrongful {{dismissal}} {{refers to}} a <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> which contravenes a contract's terms, whether expressly agreed or implied by the courts. This depends on construction of the contract, read {{in the context of}} the statutory charter of rights for employees in the ERA 1996. In the old common law cases, the only term implied by the courts regarding termination was that employers had to give reasonable notice, and what was [...] "reasonable" [...] essentially depended on the professional status of the employee. In Creen v Wright, Lord Coleridge CJ held that a master mariner was entitled to a month's notice, though lower class workers could probably expect much less, [...] "respectable" [...] employees could expect more, and the period between wage payments would be a guide. Now the ERA 1996 section 86 prescribes that an employee should receive one week's notice before dismissal after one month's work, two weeks' notice after two years' work, and so forth up to twelve weeks for twelve years. The employer can give pay in lieu of notice, so long as the weeks' wages for the notice are paid in full. Often, contracts of employment contain express terms regarding a proper disciplinary procedure to be followed if someone is to be dismissed for disputes at work. Dismissals will usually be regarded as both wrongful and unfair if a procedure for dismissal is not followed. If a contractual disciplinary procedure is not followed, the employee may claim damages for the time it would have taken and the potential that she would still be employed. In Societe Generale, London Branch v Geys, the Supreme Court affirmed that a wrongful repudiation of a contract by the employer would not automatically terminate the agreement, because to do so would be to reward the wrongdoer. Only if an employee accepts the purported termination will the contract end. Until then the employer is liable for paying wages, and other terms of the contract, such as dismissal procedures, will survive.|$|E
