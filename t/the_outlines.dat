5|$|Interpretations {{of other}} {{features}} of Opabinia fossils differ. Since the animals {{did not have}} mineralized armor nor even tough organic exoskeletons like those of insects, their bodies were flattened as they were buried and fossilized, and smaller or internal features appear as markings within <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> of the fossils.|$|E
5|$|Scholarly {{consensus}} favours an Anglo-Saxon, probably Kentish origin for the Bayeux tapestry. This famous {{narrative of}} the Conquest is not a true woven tapestry but an embroidered hanging worked in wool yarn on a tabby-woven linen ground using outline or stem stitch for lettering and <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> of figures, and couching or laid work for filling in figures.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>outlines</b> of an animal's {{body can}} be made hard to see by other methods, such as by using a highly {{irregular}} outline. For example, the comma butterfly, Polygonia c-album, is highly cryptic when its wings are closed, with cryptic colours, disruptive pattern, and irregular outer margins to the wings.|$|E

5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} (also {{known as}} disruptive camouflage or disruptive patterning) {{is a form}} of camouflage that works by breaking up <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> of an animal, soldier or military vehicle with a strongly contrasting pattern. It is often combined with other methods of crypsis including background colour matching and countershading. It appears paradoxical as a way of not being seen, since disruption of outlines depends on high contrast, so the patches of colour are themselves conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1940s Koppelman {{worked at the}} Museum of Non-Objective Painting on 54th Street in Manhattan (which later became the Guggenheim Museum) with, among others, Jackson Pollock, Robert De Niro, Sr., Rolph Scarlett, Lucia Autorino, and Ward Jackson. Two of his early, {{abstract}} pen and ink drawings are in the Guggenheim collection. The first recorded exhibition of Koppelman's work {{was held in the}} Lounge Gallery of the Eighth Street Playhouse in 1942, and included drawings, paintings, and sculpture. The following year, he had a solo exhibition at <b>the</b> <b>Outlines</b> Gallery in Pittsburgh.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's non-program music, though well-crafted, {{does not}} rise to {{the same level of}} {{inspiration}} as his programmatic works; he needed fantasy to {{bring out the best in}} him.

5|$|The {{production}} went mostly unnoticed {{upon its}} live broadcast. However, {{four years after}} the production of Casino Royale, CBS invited Fleming to write 32 episodes over a two-year period for a television show based on the James Bond character. Fleming agreed and began to write outlines for this series. When nothing ever came of this, however, Fleming grouped and adapted three of <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> into short stories and released the 1960 anthology For Your Eyes Only along with an additional two new short stories.|$|E
5|$|The small {{fields in}} the western part of the area are {{particularly}} characteristic of the Chew Valley and date back to the most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Fields of this category are generally small in size, regular in outline and often the boundaries preserve <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> of the earlier strip field system. Regional variations in field size and pattern do occur. For example, there is evidence of medieval clearance of woodland on the slopes around Nempnett Thrubwell, south of Bishop Sutton and west and south of Chelwood.|$|E

5000|$|The terms gimp and {{cordonnet}} can, for {{the most}} part, be used interchangeably, as both are defined as the thread that forms <b>the</b> <b>outline</b> of <b>the</b> design.

When the thread is made of more than one strand (as in Chantilly lace), it is also called a cordonnet. In machine-made laces <b>the</b> <b>outlining</b> thread is always called a cordonnet.|$|R
50|$|Once a film is purchased, {{the player}} {{will be able}} to shoot a photo with the 3DS's built in camera. The screen will show the {{silhouette}} of the household object, and the player's goal is to find an object that matches <b>the</b> <b>outline.</b> After lining <b>the</b> object up with <b>the</b> <b>outline,</b> <b>the</b> player has ten tries to take a picture that most matches <b>the</b> <b>outline.</b> <b>The</b> object's quality is measured by a percentage in the top right corner. If an object is below 60%, it won't transfer. If it's between 60% to 99%, it has a chance of either being transferred, or becoming a NostalDud. However, if the object has 100% accuracy, it will not only transfer no matter what, but all following objects created with the film will be cutouts, which means that an object won't have to match <b>the</b> <b>outline</b> of <b>the</b> film.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century all of {{the major}} {{pathways}} of drug metabolism had been discovered, along with <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> of protein and fatty acid metabolism and urea synthesis. In {{the early decades of the}} 20th century, the minor components of foods in human nutrition, the vitamins, began to be isolated and synthesized. Improved laboratory techniques such as chromatography and electrophoresis led to rapid advances in physiological chemistry, which—as biochemistry—began to achieve independence from its medical origins. In the 1920s and 1930s, biochemists—led by Hans Krebs and Carl and Gerty Cori—began to work out many of the central metabolic pathways of life: the citric acid cycle, glycogenesis and glycolysis, and the synthesis of steroids and porphyrins. Between the 1930s and 1950s, Fritz Lipmann and others established the role of ATP as the universal carrier of energy in the cell, and mitochondria as the powerhouse of the cell. Such traditionally biochemical work continued to be very actively pursued throughout the 20th century and into the 21st.|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{patterns}} use strongly contrasting, non-repeating markings such as spots or stripes {{to break}} up <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> of an animal or military vehicle, or to conceal telltale features, especially the eyes, as in the common frog. Disruptive patterns may use more than one method to defeat visual systems such as edge detection. Predators like the leopard use disruptive camouflage to help them approach prey, while potential prey like the Egyptian nightjar use it to avoid detection by predators. Disruptive patterning is common in military usage, both for uniforms and for military vehicles. Disruptive patterning, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by factors like shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of {{the fossil}} record {{continued}} to advance rapidly {{during the first few}} decades of the 19th century. By the 1840s, <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> of the geologic timescale were becoming clear, and in 1841 John Phillips named three major eras, based on the predominant fauna of each: the Paleozoic, dominated by marine invertebrates and fish, the Mesozoic, the age of reptiles, and the current Cenozoic age of mammals. This progressive picture of the history of life was accepted even by conservative English geologists like Adam Sedgwick and William Buckland; however, like Cuvier, they attributed the progression to repeated catastrophic episodes of extinction followed by new episodes of creation. Unlike Cuvier, Buckland and some other advocates of natural theology among British geologists made efforts to explicitly link the last catastrophic episode proposed by Cuvier to the biblical flood.|$|E

5000|$|Kenmare {{needlepoint}} lace begins with {{two pieces of}} cloth. Over this is layered a pattern and a matt contact.

The pattern is filled in by working in from <b>the</b> <b>outline.</b> <b>The</b> tension makes the pattern. How tightly the stitches are pulled determines whether the pattern's stitches are open or tight.

5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} gemsbok, sable antelope, and Grant's gazelle, are camouflaged with {{strongly}} disruptive facial markings that {{conceal the}} highly recognisable eye. Many species, such as gazelles, may be made to look flat, and hence to blend into the background, by countershading. <b>The</b> <b>outlines</b> of many bovids are broken up with bold disruptive colouration, the strongly contrasting patterns helping to delay recognition by predators. However, all the Hippotraginae (including the gemsbok) have pale bodies and faces with conspicuous markings. The zoologist Tim Caro describes this as difficult to explain, but given that the species are diurnal, he suggests that the markings may function in communication. Strongly contrasting leg colouration is common only in the Bovidae, where for example Bos, Ovis, bontebok and gemsbok have white stockings. Again, communication is the likely function.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} financing {{from other}} sources, including Saul Zaentz (who agreed {{to distribute the}} soundtrack album on his Fantasy Records label), the budget was tight enough to exclude pencil tests, so Bakshi had to test the animation by flipping an animator's drawings in his hand before they were inked and painted. When a cameraman realized that the cels for the desert scenes were not wide enough and revealed the transparency, Bakshi painted a cactus to cover the mistake. Very few storyboards were used. Bakshi and Vita walked around the Lower East Side, Washington Square Park, Chinatown and Harlem, taking moody snapshots. Artist Ira Turek inked <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> of these photographs onto cels with a Rapidograph, the technical pen preferred by Crumb, giving the film's backgrounds a stylized realism virtually unprecedented in animation. The tones of the watercolor backgrounds were influenced {{by the work of}} Ashcan School painters such as George Luks and John French Sloan. Among other unusual techniques, bent and fisheye camera perspectives were used to portray the way the film's hippies and hoodlums viewed the city. Many scenes featured documentary recordings of real conversations in place of scripted dialogue—this too would become a signature of Bakshi's.|$|E
5|$|Stigwood and Russell {{decided to}} hold auditions with the eight actresses portraying Eva in the musical's {{worldwide}} productions, with an undisclosed number performing screen tests in New York and London. In November 1981, Russell continued holding screen tests at Elstree Studios. Karla DeVito {{was among those who}} auditioned for the role of Eva. Russell also travelled to London, where he screen tested Liza Minnelli wearing a blonde wig and custom-period gowns. He felt that Minnelli, a more established film actress, would be better suited for the role, but Rice, Stigwood and Paramount wanted Elaine Paige, the first actress to play Eva in the London stage production. Russell began working on his own screenplay without Stigwood, Rice or Lloyd Webber's approval. His script followed <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> of the stage production, but established the character of Ché as a newspaper reporter. The script also contained a hospital montage for Eva and Ché, in which they pass each other on gurneys in white corridors as she is being treated for cancer, while Ché is beaten and injured by rioters. Russell was ultimately fired from the project after telling Stigwood he would not do the film without Minnelli.|$|E
