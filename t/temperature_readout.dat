40|$|The {{work here}} {{presented}} proposes an enhanced procedure to describe bulk temperature profiles in pipe flow subjected to microwaves, {{by means of}} on-line infrared <b>temperature</b> <b>readouts.</b> Such procedure is intended to overcome the well-known difficulties connected with temperature readings while microwave heating takes place. In facts, temperatures are usually measured onto few points by means of fiberoptic probes, which are often not reasonable for properly controlling the process at hand, as the electromagnetic distribution inside the cavity yields highly uneven spatial distribution of the temperature field. This study proves that looking inside the microwave oven through a metallic grid can be successfully realized, provided proper preliminary calibration procedures are in place. In order to assess whether the resulting <b>temperature</b> <b>readouts</b> are reasonable, experimental bulk temperature related to two temperature levels and two flow rates, are compared with numerical results obtained by running a 3 D FEM model, developed by the authors.

40|$|Identification of {{microscopic}} configuration of point defects acting as quantum bits {{is a key}} step in the advance of quantum information processing and sensing. Among the numerous candidates, silicon vacancy related centers in silicon carbide (SiC) have shown remarkable properties owing to their particular spin- 3 / 2 ground and excited states.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{experimental}} implementation of a high-speed and robust quantum memory for light. A novel far off-resonant Raman approach to ensemble-based quantum memories in a room-temperature environment is developed and demonstrated.
