2500|$|Many Israelis, both Jewish and Arab, are not {{familiar}} with zoos and get [...] "overexcited" [...] at seeing the animals on display. Dozens of zoo personnel man the displays during peak holiday times to stop visitors from throwing food and other items at the animals. The animals do have a preference for Bamba, the popular children's peanut-and-corn snack (though it gives the monkeys diarrhea); other common projectiles include bottles, plastic bags, and children's shoes. In 1997 a <b>toco</b> <b>toucan</b> was found dead in its cage next to pieces of avocado, a known bird toxin. In 2006 a hippopotamus died after swallowing a tennis ball tossed into its enclosure. Over the past decade and a half, the zoo staff claims that public awareness has improved.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{have shown}} that some birds use their beaks to rid {{themselves}} of excess heat. The <b>toco</b> <b>toucan,</b> which has the largest beak relative {{to the size of}} its body of any bird species, is capable of modifying the blood flow to its beak. This process allows the beak to work as a [...] "transient thermal radiator", reportedly rivaling an elephant's ears in its ability to radiate body heat. Measurements of the bill sizes of several species of American sparrows found in salt marshes along the North American coastlines show a strong correlation with summer temperatures recorded in the locations where the sparrows breed; latitude alone showed a much weaker correlation. By dumping excess heat through their bills, the sparrows are able to avoid the water loss which would be required by evaporative cooling—an important benefit in a windy habitat where freshwater is scarce. Several ratites, including the common ostrich, the emu and the southern cassowary, use various bare parts of their bodies (including their beaks) to dissipate as much as 40% of their metabolic heat production. Alternately, studies {{have shown that}} birds from colder climates (higher altitudes or latitudes and lower environmental temperatures) have smaller beaks, lessening heat loss from that structure.|$|E

2500|$|Historic Hill {{contains}} Bird House, Bird Garden, Sea Lion Sound, Herpetarium, Chain of Lakes, Flight Cage and Cypress Swamp, and Primate House. The Bird House features birds {{as varied}} as bald eagle, rhinoceros hornbill, hyacinth macaw, burrowing owl, <b>toco</b> <b>toucan,</b> Cape thick-knee, golden pheasant, kookaburra, Mariana fruit-dove, king vulture, horned guan, superb starling, tawny frogmouth, and the Guam kingfisher, which is extinct in the wild. The Bird Garden contains outdoor bird enclosures. Sea Lion Sound provides an underwater viewing tunnel of California sea lions and three harbor seals. The herpetarium houses most of the zoo's reptiles and amphibians, including the critically endangered Jamaican iguana, Chinese alligator, McCord's box turtle, Panamanian golden frog, and Arakan forest turtle. Other species include the Komodo dragon, green anaconda, mountain chicken, spotted turtle, false gharial, king cobra, Gila monster, frill-necked lizard, Aldabra giant tortoise, tuatara, reticulated python, tiger salamander, three-toed amphiuma, pancake tortoise, and over two dozen species of pit vipers from around the world. The Chain of Lakes {{is a series of}} small enclosures between the Bird House and the Herpetarium and Primate House, where the zoo's North American river otters and alligator snapping turtles reside. In 1904, the Flight Cage was the largest bird cage ever built, and {{is still one of the}} world's largest free-flight aviaries at [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] high. The Cypress Swamp is dedicated to North American birds found it the cypress swamps of the southern Mississippi River. Among the birds in the aviary are black-crowned night heron, blue-winged teal, bufflehead duck, cattle egret, double-crested cormorant, great egret, wood duck, northern bobwhite, roseate spoonbill, snowy egret, and American white ibis. Primate House is home to the zoo's monkeys and lemurs. Species included are Allen's swamp monkey, Coquerel's sifaka, golden-headed lion tamarin, black-and-white colobus monkey, lion-tailed macaque, pygmy marmoset, ring-tailed lemur, and white-faced saki.|$|E

50|$|The Blackburn Pavilion is a rainforest-themed {{tropical}} bird aviary {{that opened}} in March 2008, as a refurishment of the zoo's out-of-date bird house. The building was originally constructed in 1883, as a reptile house. The pavilion houses fifty different species of exotic birds, including Socorro doves, Mindanao bleeding-hearts, scarlet ibis, <b>toco</b> <b>toucans,</b> splendid sunbirds, pied avocets and blue-winged kookaburras. Outside the entrance {{is one of the}} pavilion's prominent features, a large elaborate clock by Tim Hunkin. It gives a bird-themed display every thirty minutes throughout the day.|$|R
5000|$|Blue-throated macaws usually nests in {{cavities}} of palm trees, {{most often}} Attalea phalerata, although it will nest in other palm species as well. Dead palms are the preferred nest {{as they are}} hollowed out by large grubs after the tree has died. Nesting pairs of blue-throated macaws don’t consistently stay at one nest for consecutive breeding seasons and will usually search for different nesting sites every year. In the wild the blue-throated macaw often competes for nesting-holes in trees with the blue-and-yellow macaw, green-winged macaw, scarlet macaw, large woodpeckers, <b>toco</b> <b>toucans,</b> barn owls, bats, and bees. [...] The number of suitable nest trees has been reduced by land clearing in its range.|$|R

5000|$|In its {{capacity}} to remove body heat the bill is {{comparable to that of}} elephant ears. The ability to radiate heat depends upon air speed: if this is low only 25% of the adult bird's resting heat production to as much as four times this heat production. In comparison, the bill of a duck and the ears of elephant can shed only 9 to 9.1% of resting heat production. The bill normally is responsible for 30 to 60% of heat loss. The practice of <b>toco</b> <b>toucans</b> of placing their bills under their wings may serve to insulate the bill and reduce heat loss during sleep. It has been observed that [...] "complexities of the vasculature and controlling mechanisms needed to adjust the blood flow to the bill may not be completely developed untiladulthood." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposal}} {{of this study}} was to compare the effects of two commercial diets, one consisting of dry dog food and another one of pelletized feed for toucans, in the growth of young <b>toco</b> <b>toucans.</b> The development of 14 specimens was observed, being four and five months of age, and divided randomly into two groups. Once a week, the fasted birds were weighted and evaluated in relation to the following biometrics parameters, with the help of a caliper: wings (right and left); head and beak (length, width and height), wingspan and total body length. To evaluate the presence of difference in body gain between the two groups, the U test of Mann-Whitney was used as statistical analysis, with significance level of 0. 05 in a bilateral test. Birds of both groups showed no changes in behavior such as depression or aggression. The diets were well accepted, no waste was observed and all the animals remained healthy during the research. In respect to biometrics, toucans fed with dog food had a better development for the length of right and left wings, head width, height and length of the beak and weight gain, when compared with those treated with feed for toucans. This fact enables the use of dry dog food with 23 % of crude protein and 71, 15 mg/Kg of iron for feeding of <b>toco</b> <b>toucans</b> in captivity. Propôs-se comparar os efeitos de duas dietas comerciais, uma composta por ração canina e outra por ração para tucanos no desenvolvimento de tucanos-toco jovens. Avaliou-se 14 espécimes, com idades entre quatro e cinco meses, distribuídas aleatoriamente em dois grupos. Uma vez por semana realizou-se a pesagem das aves em jejum e biometria individual dos parâmetros: asas esquerda e direita (comprimento); cabeça e bico (comprimento, largura e altura); envergadura e comprimento total do corpo, com o auxílio de um paquímetro. Para avaliar a existência ou não de diferenças estatisticamente significantes entre o peso e os dados biométricos obtidos nos dois grupos, utilizou-se o teste U de Mann-Whitney, com nível de significância de 0, 05, em um teste bilateral. As aves de ambos os grupos não apresentaram alterações de comportamento como depressão ou agressividade. As dietas foram bem aceitas, não houve desperdício e todos os animais permaneceram hígidos durante a pesquisa. Tucanos alimentados com ração para cães com nível máximo de 71, 15 mg/Kg de ferro e 23 % de proteína bruta, apresentaram melhor desenvolvimento para comprimento das asas direita e esquerda, largura da cabeça, altura do bico na base, comprimento do bico na base e ganho de peso, quando comparados com aqueles tratados com ração para tucanos. Conclui-se que as rações comerciais utilizadas, sobretudo a canina, oferecem suporte para ganho de peso, e medidas corporais favoráveis ao desenvolvimento normal de tucanos-toco jovens. Entretanto, novos estudos devem ser realizados para a determinação da dieta ideal para essas aves em cativeiro...|$|R
50|$|Like the keel-billed toucan, the <b>toco</b> <b>toucan</b> is {{sometimes}} kept in captivity, {{but has a}} high fruit diet and is sensitive to haemochromatosis (an iron storage disease). Also, pet toco toucans must {{not be permitted to}} eat mouse (or rat) meat, due to a risk of bacterial infection. There is an ongoing population management plan that should help to revert the decreasing captive population of the <b>toco</b> <b>toucan</b> for Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) member institutions.
