5|$|Early in 1953, Carson began {{library and}} field {{research}} on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore. In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, <b>The</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> the Sea, which focuses on life in coastal ecosystems (particularly along the Eastern Seaboard). It appeared in The New Yorker in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by Houghton Mifflin (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; <b>The</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> the Sea received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for The Sea Around Us.|$|E

5|$|Marine {{habitats}} can {{be divided}} horizontally into coastal and open ocean habitats. Coastal habitats extend from the shoreline to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the continental shelf. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only 7 {{percent of the total}} ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the continental shelf. Alternatively, marine habitats {{can be divided}} vertically into pelagic (open water), demersal (just above the seabed), and benthic (sea bottom) habitats. A third division is by latitude: from tropical to temperate to polar waters.|$|E

40|$|A {{system is}} {{described}} to measure alignment between interfacing <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> mirror segments positioned {{to form a}} segmented mirror surface.

The bending beam has a first position corresponding to alignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> adjacent mirror segments, and it is bendable from the first position in a direction and to a degree dependent upon the relative misalignment between <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> adjacent mirror segments to correspondingly vary {{the resistance of the}} strain guage.
