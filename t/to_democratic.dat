5|$|According to Peter Woolley, {{director}} of Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind poll, {{the situation of}} the election was similar to the 1990 election, when underdog Senate candidate Christie Whitman, a Republican, nearly defeated well-known Senator Bill Bradley due <b>to</b> <b>Democratic</b> Governor Jim Florio's sales- and income-tax increases. By August, Woolley concluded that the tax increase had had no effect on Menendez's re-election chances.|$|E

5|$|Brown is {{a member}} of the Republican Party, and faced the Democratic candidate, Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley in the 2010 special election, which had {{occurred}} after the 2009 death of long-time Senator Ted Kennedy for the remainder of Kennedy's term ending January 3, 2013. While initially trailing Coakley in polling by a large margin, Brown saw a sudden late surge in the polls and posted a surprise win to become the first Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. Brown ran for a full Senate term in 2012, but lost <b>to</b> <b>Democratic</b> challenger Elizabeth Warren. He subsequently joined the board of directors of Kadant paper company, joined Fox News as a commentator, and joined Nixon Peabody where he provided legal services.|$|E
5|$|Clinton's November 2000 {{visit to}} Vietnam {{was the first}} by a U.S. {{president}} {{since the end of}} the Vietnam War. On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law the U.S.–China Relations Act of 2000, which granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) trade status to People's Republic of China. The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China <b>to</b> <b>democratic</b> reform. Clinton also oversaw a boom of the U.S. economy. Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969.|$|E
5|$|During {{the wars}} of the Diadochi that {{followed}} the death of Alexander the Great, Ptolemy, who had seized control of Egypt, {{had taken over the}} island of Cyprus and used it as a base of operations against his rival Antigonus I Monophthalmus. From Cyprus, Ptolemy's forces were able to raid the coasts of Syria and Asia Minor. In early 306 BC, Antigonus resolved to remove this threat, and ordered his son, Demetrius, to capture the island. Demetrius at the time was in Greece, where he had in the previous year overthrown the garrison installed in Athens by the ruler of Macedon, Cassander. The city, along with neighbouring Megara, was restored <b>to</b> <b>democratic</b> rule, and allied itself with Demetrius. As a result, when Demetrius sailed from Athens in spring 306 to capture Cyprus, he was accompanied by 30 Athenian quadriremes.|$|E

5|$|Ellis {{also found}} {{evidence}} that Mandela had been {{an active member of}} the South African Communist Party during the late 1950s and early 1960s, something that was confirmed after his death by both the ANC and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee. His membership had been hidden by the ANC, aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from Western countries. Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist-Leninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed <b>to</b> <b>democratic</b> systems of governance.|$|E
5|$|Ijaz has run Crescent as a {{quantitative}} asset {{manager for the}} past 25 years, integrating venture capital investments into the company's activities during the past decade. His venture investments included unsuccessful efforts in 2013 to acquire a stake in Lotus F1, a Formula One team. He was for some time a media analyst focusing on Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan, {{and the role of}} Muslim-Americans in U.S. political life. In the 1990s, Ijaz and his companies were contributors <b>to</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party institutions as well as the presidential candidacies of Bill Clinton. During that time, he acted as an unofficial channel for communications between the United States and foreign governments, notably of Sudan, India and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 {{campaign}} season, in {{an effort}} to offer an alternative <b>to</b> <b>Democratic</b> policies and to unite distant wings of the Republican Party, Gingrich and several other Republicans came up with a Contract with America, which laid out ten policies that Republicans promised to bring to a vote on the House floor during the first hundred days of the new Congress, if they won the election. The contract was signed by Gingrich and other Republican candidates for the House of Representatives. The contract ranged from issues such as welfare reform, term limits, tougher crime laws, and a balanced budget law, to more specialized legislation such as restrictions on American military participation in United Nations missions.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} remove any {{challenge}} to their rule and to white supremacy, Alabama leadership enacted a new constitution in 1901, disenfranchising most of the African Americans and poor Whites, by {{the implementation of a}} poll tax, literacy tests and a grandfather clause; other dispositions they used {{in order to reduce the}} challenges <b>to</b> the <b>Democratic</b> party from other parties and independents were a sore-loser law and a loyalty pledge binding any participent <b>to</b> the <b>Democratic</b> primary <b>to</b> the <b>Democratic</b> candidates.|$|R
5|$|It {{was rumored}} that Douglas {{would be given}} a {{political}} appointment in the Truman administration, but the Nixon-Douglas race had made such an appointment too controversial for the President. According <b>to</b> <b>Democratic</b> National Committee vice-chair India Edwards, a Douglas supporter, the former congresswoman {{could not have been}} appointed dogcatcher. In 1952, she returned to acting, and eight years later campaigned for John F. Kennedy during Nixon's first, unsuccessful presidential run. She also campaigned for George McGovern in his unsuccessful bid to prevent Nixon's 1972 reelection, and called for his ouster from office during the Watergate scandal.|$|E
5|$|On a joint ballot of the General Assembly in 1900, Bradley was {{defeated}} {{for a seat}} in the U.S. Senate by a vote of 75–54. After the unseating of Taylor, the state Republican party split into factions, with Godfrey Hunter at the head of one and Bradley {{at the head of the}} other. The two factions formed a tentative alliance to nominate Danville law professor John W. Yerkes in the special election called after Goebel's assassination, but Yerkes lost <b>to</b> <b>Democratic</b> nominee J. C. W. Beckham. At the 1904 Republican National Convention, Bradley was chosen to second the nomination of Theodore Roosevelt for president.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Humphrey's run, President Lyndon Johnson began a {{campaign}} for re-election, entering {{his name in the}} first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary for March 1968. Late in 1967, building upon anti-war sentiment, Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota entered the race with heavy criticism of the President's Vietnam War policies. Even before McCarthy's entrance, Johnson grew concerned about a challenge. He confided <b>to</b> <b>Democratic</b> Congressional leaders that an opponent could pull the support of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Dr. Benjamin Spock, defeating him in New Hampshire, and forcing his withdrawal from the race; similar to Senator Estes Kefauver's 1952 challenge to President Harry Truman, which likely caused Truman not to seek re-election.|$|E

40|$|Cooperatives are {{organized}} <b>to</b> be <b>democratic.</b> However, large membership size can create problems for democratic process and governance. Attending meetings and casting votes {{may not be}} enough <b>to</b> preserve <b>democratic</b> characteristics. This report develops a set of propositions-a theory-for structuring membership <b>to</b> improve <b>democratic</b> opportunities and responsiveness. Aspects of these propositions are tested against data from dairy herd improvement cooperatives in Wisconsin and are supported. These propositions suggest potential structural design options, given specific stressors in the membership environment, and the management and operations environment...|$|R

5|$|The {{new head}} of state, Ibrahim Babangida, {{declared}} himself president and {{commander in chief of}} the armed forces and of the ruling Supreme Military Council. He set 1990 as the official deadline for a return <b>to</b> <b>democratic</b> governance. Babangida's tenure was marked by a flurry of political activity: he instituted the International Monetary Fund's Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) to aid in the repayment of the country's crushing international debt. At the time most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing that debt. He enrolled Nigeria in the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which aggravated religious tensions in the country.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster, Smith accepted in principle that white minority rule {{could not be}} prolonged indefinitely. He oversaw the 1979 general election which resulted in Abel Muzorewa, a politically moderate black bishop, being elected Prime Minister. Both ZANU and ZAPU had boycotted the election, which did not receive international recognition. At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1979, held in Lusaka, the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher surprised delegates by announcing that the UK would officially recognise Rhodesia's independence if it transitioned <b>to</b> <b>democratic</b> majority rule.|$|E
5|$|A known {{historical}} {{resident of}} Zaprešić was Count Josip Jelačić of Bužim (1801–59), the Ban of Croatia from 1848 until his death. Although born in Novi Sad, Serbia (then Habsburg Monarchy), {{he received an}} estate in Zaprešić together with his title. He is responsible for abolishing serfdom in Croatia in 1848, but also for an infamous suppression of Croatian intelligentsia, and the Illyrian movement during his reign under the orders of Baron Alexander von Bach, and Emperor Franz Joseph I. A statue of Jelačić riding a horse was constructed by Anton Dominik Fernkorn, and placed on the Zagreb's central square, Ban Jelačić Square. The statue has been repeatedly removed, and reinstated during changes in political power and orientation in Croatia, from monarchist, through ultra-nationalist, and communist, up <b>to</b> <b>democratic.</b> After the Croatian declaration of independence, marking {{the start of the}} democratic era, the statue was returned to the square, and Zaprešić credits Jelačić with a major arterial road named in his honor.|$|E
