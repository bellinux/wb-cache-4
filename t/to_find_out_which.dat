5|$|According {{to coach}} McKay, the team’s {{progress}} was set back as {{they spent the}} preseason trying <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> veterans would develop into regulars, but found that the younger players were better. This meant that the team started over from the beginning as the regular season began. The tone for the season seemed {{to be set as}} the team got lost in the Houston Astrodome when leaving the locker room to take the field for their opening game. They spent 20 minutes trying to find their way out, and barely made it to the field in time for the opening kickoff. The team started out with solid defensive play, ranking in the top 10 until injuries began to set in. They began to wear out as the Buccaneers’ offensive ineptitude meant that the defense {{spent a lot of time}} on the field, over 100 plays in some games. Receiver Johnny McKay pointed out the tendency of the offense to feel pressured after a three-and-out possession, with the result that they would press even harder the next time, quickly going three-and-out again. Coach McKay said early on that controlling the ball for 40 percent of the game, as they were, was not long enough to win. Placekicker Mirro Roder was cut after missing three field goals in the first two games, in both of which the Buccaneers were shut out, giving their offense the nickname “Zero Gang”, which stuck with them through a total of eleven shutouts before their first victory as a franchise.|$|E
5|$|The {{final version}} of the game was co-developed by Square Enix and HexaDrive, a company created by former Capcom staff members. As the new form of The 3rd Birthday had {{transformed}} into a third-person shooter, Square Enix wanted staff members with experience at developing such games, and then-company CEO Yoichi Wada recommended HexaDrive to Tabata. As multiple HexaDrive staff members had also worked on fellow shooter , Tabata agreed to the collaboration. While aiming for a high quality product, the team designed the game as if for the PlayStation 3 home console, then worked to fit it onto the PSP. During development, the team sought creative help from the team developing Final Fantasy XIII for the visual design. The team had previous experimented with shooters with , but this time they wanted to create something closer to a third-person shooter. The team was assembled by Tabata based on their development experience with action games. While working inside the control and hardware limitations of the title, the team created firearms and the lock-on mechanic as the fundamental attack action, instead of the free-roaming style of a standard third-person shooter. While designing levels to function with the game's Overdive system, the team considered what the level would hold, how often players would utilize the function, the difficulty of levels, and the positioning and strength of enemies. During development, a questionnaire was circulated around company staff concerning the character Aya, <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> of the planned features was popular. One of those that survived in the final game was Aya's clothes being damaged when she was hit by an enemy, which was used to emphasize her sexuality. Nomura {{was among the first to}} suggest this feature originally.|$|E
5|$|While {{reports by}} owners of fitting names are of interest, some {{scientists}} have questioned their value {{in deciding whether}} nominative determinism is a real effect. Instead, {{they argue that the}} claim that a name affects life decisions is an extraordinary one that requires extraordinary evidence. To select only those cases that seem to give evidence for nominative determinism is to ignore those that do not. Analysis of large numbers of names is therefore needed. In 2002 Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones analysed various databases containing first names, surnames, occupations, cities and states. In one study they concluded that people named Dennis gravitate towards dentistry. They did this by retrieving the number of dentists called Dennis (482) from a database of US dentists. They then used the 1990 Census <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> male first name was the next most popular after Dennis: Walter. The likelihood of a US male being called Dennis was 0.415% and the likelihood of a US male being called Walter was 0.416%. The researchers then retrieved the number of dentists called Walter (257). Comparing the relative frequencies of Dennis and Walter led them to their conclusion that the name Dennis is over-represented in dentistry. However, in 2011, Uri Simonsohn published a paper in which he criticized Pelham et al. for not considering confounding factors and reported on how the popularity of Dennis and Walter as baby names has varied over the decades. Given Walter was a relatively old-fashioned name it was far more likely for Pelham et al. to find people named Dennis to have any job, not just that of dentist, and people named Walter to be retired. Simonsohn did indeed find a disproportionally high number of Dennis lawyers compared to Walter lawyers.|$|E

25|$|Tunnels on steep {{gradients}} {{can present}} problems for air-breathing locomotives, such as steam locomotives and diesel locomotives. Poor ventilation in long or narrow tunnels can starve the locomotive of power.

Unfortunately, the necessary compensation for gradient {{is not a simple}} equation, but is rather a trial and error process. Since one cannot build several tunnels <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> one is best, it is useful to study existing tunnels with steep gradients.|$|E

500|$|The storyline which {{featured}} the character's old nemesis DC Hooch drew criticism of Becky's excessive littering of her cigarette butts. Environmental agencies 'Keep Britain Tidy' and 'CleanupUK' commented: [...] "It is disappointing that Coronation Street chooses to allow {{one of its}} characters to throw a butt {{on the floor and}} suggest that it is okay to treat our streets like a giant ashtray. We understand the writers are concerned with realism but Becky is a role model to many viewers. We all have a responsibility to keep our local area clean and we would hope that producers of programmes such as Coronation Street would support our call to encourage the public to keep our country tidy." [...] A spokesperson for the show defended Becky's actions, stating they were portraying the character's high levels of stress realistically. Inside Soap readers voted in a poll <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> character would be missed the most after they depart. Becky won with sixty percent of the vote, whilst up against Eve Jenson (Emmerdale) and Ronnie Mitchell (EastEnders). Julie Richardson writing for Orange U.K. said she [...] "loved a good TV scrap" [...] and the serial had [...] "a corker" [...] with Becky and Kylie's fight which took place in 2011. Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror praised Becky's feud with Tracy, explaining it was a [...] "perfectly poised, barbed battle". Though he said it was ruined by Kylie's return.|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners {{was pleased}} with the episode; he noted that he [...] "felt it was a very {{interesting}} character study". He later called it [...] "one of my favorite episodes". Frank Spotnitz considered [...] "Milagro" [...] to have been an [...] "underappreciated" [...] episode. For this reason, it was later included on the X-Files Essentials DVD compilation, along with seven other episodes. Scully's portrayal in the episode was given special attention. Stegall noted that [...] "if 'Milagro' has one message about perception, it is shown in Scully, who is seen through everyone's eyes (Mulder, Padgett, even Naciamento) but her own. Ultimately, we can't know which ones of these portraits of her character are 'right'. Maybe none of them are. It's a bravura performance from Gillian Anderson, well matched by Duchovny's low-key Mulder, acting on his instincts.". Handlen argued that the episode reduces Scully [...] "to a victim waiting <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> handsome man will rescue her." [...] Elyce Rae Helford, in her book Fantasy Girls: Gender in the New Universe of Science Fiction and Fantasy Television, accused the show of [...] "reinforc the stereotype [...] of independent women as lonely, neurotic, and nostalgic for sexual attention from men." [...] Anderson herself felt that the character needed to [...] "loosen up". She was once approached by a fan who applauded Scully as the [...] "epitome of womanhood" [...] because she is a character who [...] "not only can kick ass but she [...] works with Mulder without jumping him." [...] Anderson, in return jokingly replied, [...] "So the epitome of womanhood is sexual restraint? [...] I don't think so." [...] The episode was particularly analyzed by fans of the show, and the fact that Scully was almost seduced provoked [...] "lively internet discussion".|$|E

Lee Barron, in his essay The Seven Ages of Kylie Minogue: Postmodernism, Identity, and Performative Mimicry, noted that the song [...] "further established Minogue's cultural and commercial relevance in the new millennium." [...] He remarked that the song [...] "with its hypnotic ’la la la’ refrain and the deceptively uncomplicated, catchily repetitive beats and synth-sound, marked yet another clearly defined image transformation from the camp-infused Light Years to an emphasis upon a cool, machine-like sexuality, a trait clearly identifiable within the promotional video for ’Can’t Get You Out of My Head.’" [...] Similarly, Everett True from The Guardian wrote that the song continued the [...] "change in the marketing and public perception of Kylie" [...] and her transition from the [...] "homely girl-next-door" [...] to [...] "a much more flirtatious, sophisticated persona" [...] that started with the release of [...] "Spinning Around" [...] in 2000. True also felt that the success of [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] was one of the motivating factors behind [...] "manufactured" [...] pop music gaining a [...] "new postmodern respectability" [...] and marked a [...] "clear shift in attitude towards pop music among the 'serious' rock critic fraternity: the idea that (manufactured, female) pop music might well be the equal of (organic, male) rock music after all, that each has their high points and their low." [...] In 2011, Minogue's official website posted a special article marking the song's 10th anniversary on 8 September, the release date of [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] in Australia.
