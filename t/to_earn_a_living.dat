5|$|In 1974, Roddenberry {{was paid}} $25,000 by John Whitmore {{to write a}} script called The Nine, Intended to be about Andrija Puharich's parapsychological research, it evolved into a frank {{exploration}} of his experiences attempting <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> attending science fiction conventions. At the time, he was again close to losing his house {{because of a lack}} of income.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{years of his}} fight career, and for some time after it ended, he acted as a second for other {{prominent}} fighters and ran a public house. His dissipation outside the ring appears to have resulted in his decision to leave England for Ireland, where he continued to tutor other boxers but eventually resorted to gambling <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> <b>a</b> <b>living.</b> He died a broken man, both physically and financially.|$|E
5|$|Tristano also {{complained about}} the commercialization of jazz and what he {{perceived}} to be the requirement to abandon the artistic part of playing in order <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> from performing. Later commentators have suggested that these complaints ignored the freedom that he was given by Atlantic and blamed others for what in many cases were the outcomes of his own career decisions.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1966, Hendrix was {{struggling}} <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> playing the R circuit as a backing guitarist. After being referred to Chas Chandler, who {{was leaving the}} Animals and interested in managing and producing artists, Hendrix was signed to a management and production contract with Chandler and ex-Animals manager Michael Jeffery. Chandler brought Hendrix to London and began recruiting members for a band designed to showcase the guitarist's talents, the Jimi Hendrix Experience. In late October, after having been rejected by Decca Records, the Experience signed with Track, a new label formed by the Who's managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp.|$|E
5|$|Calcraft {{was born}} in Baddow, near Chelmsford, in 1800. He was a cobbler by trade, but had also worked as a nightwatchman at Reid's brewery in Clerkenwell, London. While {{attempting}} <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> by selling meat pies on the streets around Newgate Prison he made the acquaintance of John Foxton, who was the City of London's hangman for 40years. That meeting led to his employment at Newgate to flog juvenile offenders, {{for which he was}} paid 10shillings a week.|$|E
5|$|During this time, the {{authorities}} imposed a ban preventing Rajab {{from engaging in}} any new business in Bahrain that {{made it difficult for}} him <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> <b>a</b> <b>living.</b> The ban was subsequently lifted without any official explanation. In mid-August 2010, a number of opposition activists were again arrested. According to Rajab, an order for his arrest was issued on 8 September but was cancelled on 18 October. Rajab was also subject to a travel ban during this period.|$|E

At those Games, Guèye had become the first black African to compete at the Winter Olympics. Following the Sarajevo Games, Guèye retired temporarily from competing professionally and instead took up employment as a model and an actor, in addition <b>to</b> <b>earning</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> in the finance sector.|$|R
5000|$|Kashdan {{was often}} called 'der Kleine Capablanca' (German for [...] "The little Capablanca") in Europe {{because of his}} ability to extract {{victories}} from seemingly even positions. Alexander Alekhine named him one of the most likely players to succeed him as World Champion. Kashdan could not, however, engage seriously in a chess career for financial reasons; his peak chess years coincided with the Great Depression. He resorted <b>to</b> <b>earning</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> as <b>an</b> insurance agent and administrator in order to support his family.|$|R
5|$|Fielding first {{produced}} a play in February 1728. Although his first production, Love in Several Masques, {{lasted only a}} few nights, it {{was the start of}} his career in theatre. On 16 March 1728, Fielding enrolled at the University of Leyden, but he did not abandon the theatre. His early plays were those of an amateur hobby, but he later returned to London <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> <b>a</b> <b>living.</b> Arthur Murphy, in his 1762 biographical introduction to Fielding's works, believed that Fielding returned to London and treated the theatre as a career because his father stopped an allowance of 200 pounds a year.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{his career}} Harrison was obliged <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> by {{conducting}} and other musical work, to the detriment of his composing. In early 1913 he was engaged as a répétiteur at Covent Garden, where he had the opportunity of observing Arthur Nikisch prepare Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. Later that year Harrison was appointed to the conducting staff for the season. In 1914 he was assistant conductor to Nikisch and Felix Weingartner in Paris, rehearsing Parsifal for the former and Tristan und Isolde for the latter.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} of the arrest of former governor Charles S. Morehead by federal authorities, Helm fled to Bowling Green, fearing his own arrest. Through the intervention of Warner Underwood {{he was able to}} return home on the condition that he swear an oath of allegiance to the Constitution. Nevertheless, federal soldiers repeatedly entered his home, encouraging his slaves to abandon him, and consuming or destroying his crops. Because the state's courts were closed on account of the war, he was unable <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> by practicing law. In short order his once-substantial fortune was expended, and he resorted to borrowing money to support his family.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} measure {{well-being}} more generally, Amartya Sen, Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, and other feminist economists helped develop alternatives to Gross Domestic Product, {{such as the}} Human Development Index. Other models of interest to feminist economists include the labor theory of value, which was most thoroughly developed in Das Capital by Karl Marx. That model considers production as a socially constructed human project and redefines wages as means <b>to</b> <b>earning</b> <b>a</b> <b>living.</b> This refocuses economic models on human innate desires and needs as opposed to monetary incentives.|$|R
5000|$|This triumph {{happened}} {{on the eve of}} the Nazi takeover of Germany, which quickly destroyed Goldschmidt's livelihood. Like many Jewish composers (and other composers considered subversive of the Germanic purity of the Third Reich), Goldschmidt had his work condemned as [...] "degenerate music" [...] by the regime. There was no place in German musical life for Goldschmidt since performances of his work were banned and he was barred from conducting orchestras. Goldschmidt resorted <b>to</b> <b>earning</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> by giving piano lessons, before finally leaving the country on the advice of an SS officer and emigrating to England in 1935.|$|R
50|$|Shioda {{returned}} to Japan in 1946 and spent several months {{trying to locate}} his family on Kyushu. He rejoined Ueshiba for a month of intensive training, but was forced to dedicate {{the next few years}} <b>to</b> <b>earning</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> in post-war Japan. He began teaching aikido in 1950. That year, he taught for the company Nihon Kokan at the Asano Shipyards in Yokohama. In 1954, he entered the All Japan Kobudo demonstration, and won the prize for the most outstanding demonstration. This marked a turning point for the growth of aikido. Shioda's performance attracted sponsorship that enabled him to build an aikido dojo (training hall).|$|R
5|$|Already in 1896, Sorabji's {{father was}} back in Bombay, where he played a {{significant}} role in the development of India's engineering and cotton machinery industries, among other things. Although he provided his family with financial support, he spent much of his time abroad and on 17 June 1929 bigamously married Nobubai Visvonata Catcar, causing Sorabji and his mother a substantial loss of fortune. He died in Bad Nauheim, Germany, on 8 July 1932. In the same year, Sorabji travelled to India to settle matters related to his father's estate, but obtained nothing but money from a trust fund that his father had established in 1914. Nevertheless, it saved him from having <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> <b>a</b> <b>living,</b> although his lifestyle was ascetic.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's new {{position}} left him better off financially. However, while he also {{became much more}} widely known as a composer, running the Conservatoire left him with no more time for composition than when he was struggling <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> as an organist and piano teacher. As soon as the working year was over, {{in the last days}} of July, he would leave Paris and spend the two months until early October in a hotel, usually by one of the Swiss lakes, to concentrate on composition. His works from this period include his lyric opera, Pénélope (1913), and some of his most characteristic later songs (e.g., the cycle La chanson d'Ève, Op. 95, completed in 1910) and piano pieces (Nocturnes Nos. 9–11; Barcarolles Nos. 7–11, written between 1906 and 1914).|$|E
5|$|Merrick was now {{homeless}} on {{the streets}} of Leicester. His uncle, a barber named Charles Merrick, heard of his nephew's situation, sought him out and offered him accommodation in his home. Merrick continued to hawk around Leicester {{for the next two years}} but his efforts <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> met with little more success than before. Eventually, his disfigurement drew such negative attention from members of the public that the Commissioners for Hackney Carriages withdrew his licence when it came up for renewal. With young children to provide for, Charles could no longer afford to support his nephew. In late December 1879, now 17 years old, Merrick entered the Leicester Union Workhouse.|$|E

5|$|Zappa {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> as {{a musician}} and composer, and played different nightclub gigs, some with {{a new version of}} the Blackouts. Zappa's earliest professional recordings, two soundtracks for the low-budget films The World's Greatest Sinner (1962) and Run Home Slow (1965) were more financially rewarding. The former score was commissioned by actor-producer Timothy Carey and recorded in 1961. It contains many themes that appeared on later Zappa records. The latter soundtrack was recorded in 1963 after the film was completed, but it was commissioned by one of Zappa's former high school teachers in 1959 and Zappa may have worked on it before the film was shot. Excerpts from the soundtrack can be heard on the posthumous album The Lost Episodes (1996).|$|E
5|$|At the World Indoor Championships 60 metres final, Chambers won {{a silver}} medal and {{recorded}} a new personal best of 6.54s to take second behind Olusoji Fasuba. The performance did not sway opinion: Chambers continued to encounter extensive criticism within athletics. Promoters did not invite him to key athletics events, Eddie Kulukundis – who had supported Chambers earlier in his career – refused to sponsor the sprinter, and the British Olympic Association (BOA), prevented him from competing in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. To return to the track Chambers {{had to rely on}} the money he received from his partner, Leonie Daley, a civil servant whom he met at the Miss Jamaica UK competition. The couple now had a child, a boy named Skye who was born in September 2005, and Chambers desperately needed <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> to support his family and pay off debts incurred through the drug ban. He amassed a selection of cuttings about his fall from grace and the BALCO Scandal in order to show his son the risks of drug abuse.|$|E
5|$|George Frederic Watts {{was born}} in London in 1817, {{the son of a}} musical {{instrument}} manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823 and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Meanwhile, his father's strict evangelical Christianity led to both a deep knowledge of the Bible and a strong dislike of organised religion. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and six years later was proficient enough as an artist <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> as a portrait painter and cricket illustrator. Aged 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. In 1837 Watts was commissioned by Greek shipping magnate Alexander Constantine Ionides to copy a portrait of his father by Samuel Lane; Ionides preferred Watts's version to the original and immediately commissioned two more paintings from him, allowing Watts to devote himself full-time to painting.|$|E

They {{traveled}} together following Maidana's conducting jobs between Mexico City, New York City and Houston until the early 1960s. Maidana deeply enriched Hood's knowledge of Native and Latin American cultures through travel. Around that time her husband began to show symptoms of Parkinson's disease and could no longer conduct.They chose to move to Houston where they would have access to better medical care. Houston also provided Hood with an art market better suited <b>to</b> <b>earning</b> <b>a</b> <b>living.</b> Hood supported herself and her husband {{until his death in}} 1989. After Maidana's death, Hood missed her husband, and took to painting [...] "the void" [...] with fervor.|$|R

5|$|In 1646–47, Ashmole {{made several}} {{simultaneous}} approaches to rich widows {{in the hope}} of securing a good marriage. In 1649, he married Mary, Lady Mainwaring (daughter of Sir William Forster of Aldermaston), a wealthy thrice-widowed woman twenty years his senior; she may have been a relative by marriage of his first wife's family and was the mother of grown children. The marriage took place despite the opposition of the bride's family, and it did not prove to be harmonious: Lady Mainwaring filed suit for separation and alimony but it was dismissed by the courts in 1657. Nevertheless, the marriage provided Ashmole with Mary's first husband's estates centred on Bradfield in Berkshire which left him wealthy enough to pursue his interests, including botany and alchemy, without concern for having <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> <b>a</b> <b>living.</b> He arranged for his friend Wharton to be released from prison and appointed him to manage the estates.|$|E
5|$|Unable <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> in New York {{because of}} the {{performance}} ban, Hope toured with trumpeter Chet Baker in 1957 and then began living in Los Angeles. He soon found other musicians who had been influenced by bebop, including saxophonist Harold Land and bassist Curtis Counce. Hope played with Rollins again, and, in October 1957, recorded another album, The Elmo Hope Quintet Featuring Harold Land. In March of the following year Hope became part of Counce's band, {{and went on to}} record two albums with the bassist. Hope also did some arranging for others around this time, including for Land's 1958 Harold in the Land of Jazz. Hope also had his own band, with personnel that varied, and in 1959 he played with Lionel Hampton in Hollywood. Later that year, after performances in San Francisco with two quartets – the first containing Rollins, bassist Scott LaFaro, and drummer Lenny McBrowne; the other with Rollins replaced by Land – Hope travelled north with the Land group to play at a venue in Vancouver.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} Argentina's economy {{continued}} to grow, on average, but {{more slowly than}} {{the world as a}} whole or than its neighbours, Brazil and Chile. A suggested cause is that a multitude of frequently changed regulations, at times extended to ridiculous specifics (such as a 1947 decree setting prices and menus for restaurants), choked economic activity. The long-term effect was to create pervasive disregard for the law, which Argentines came to view as <b>a</b> hindrance <b>to</b> <b>earning</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> rather than <b>an</b> aid to enforcing legitimate property rights. The combination of industrial protectionism, redistribution of income from the agrarian to the industrial sector, and growing state intervention in the economy sparked an inflationary process. By 1950, Argentina's GDP per capita accounted just nearly half of the United States.|$|R
