50|$|The Castle Haag, about 4miles (6 km) from Kapellen, is a late middle-ages {{building}} from the 15th century. The first mention of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is <b>from</b> 1337. <b>The</b> main <b>house</b> <b>from</b> 1664 was totally destroyed in 1945.|$|R
5|$|Dominating the {{appearance}} of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>from</b> the street is a large verandah-style porch, supported by large stone columns, on the southern-facing front of the house; an enclosed porch, smaller but two stories high and supported by wooden pillars, {{is located on the}} rear portion of the house's east side. Projecting {{from the front of the}} house, above the porch, is a small wing with a gable, semicircular window, and elaborate cornice.

5|$|Modern {{visitors}} typically enter <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>from</b> the High Street to the south, {{passing through}} the gatehouse, across the lower courtyard into the hall of the main building. Plas Mawr's gatehouse was only the third such entrance building {{to be built in}} North Wales, despite gatehouses being an important part of English Elizabethan architecture, designed to show off the house and provide a suitably dignified entry for visitors. Few houses in towns had the physical space for a gatehouse like Plas Mawr's. Originally, the gatehouse would have contained a suite of rooms for the steward of the house, Richard Wynn.|$|E

50|$|The {{present day}} Hindu astrology favours {{the use of}} the Vimshottari dasha system along with the Gochara system for the purpose of prognostication and for the timing of events.The correct {{determination}} of longevity, and the timing of death is a difficult. Parasara states that <b>the</b> 8th <b>house</b> counted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> occupied by Saturn at the time of birth is the Mrityu-bhava or <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Death. Add up the number of Rekhas contributed by Saturn in <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lagna to that occupied by Saturn, this figure will indicate the age at which adversity will strike the native; add up the rekhas contributed by Saturn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> occupied by Saturn to lagna, this figure will indicate the age at which the native will suffer most severe physical adversity, and even death if so indicated by the maraka-dasha operating. Alternatively, add the number of rekhas contributed by Saturn in <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> occupied by it to the Mrityu-bhava, multiply this figure by the Yoga-pinda and divide by 27 the remainder will indicate the nakshatra transiting which or the trine nakshatra therefrom Saturn will cause death, or add the number of rekhas contributed by Saturn in <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> occupied by it to the Mrityu-bhava, multiply this figure by the Yoga-pinda and divide by 12 the remainder will indicate the sign or its trine that will be transited by Saturn at the time of death.|$|R
50|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> have roofs {{that are}} tiled {{with a special}} sea-stone called marla.

5|$|The British Government {{purchased}} Hillingdon House in 1915 and {{it became}} a military hospital. In 1917, what would become the Royal Air Force station RAF Uxbridge was established within the grounds.
