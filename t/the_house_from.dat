50|$|The Castle Haag, about 4miles (6 km) from Kapellen, is a late middle-ages {{building}} from the 15th century. The first mention of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is <b>from</b> 1337. <b>The</b> main <b>house</b> <b>from</b> 1664 was totally destroyed in 1945.|$|R
5|$|Dominating the {{appearance}} of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>from</b> the street is a large verandah-style porch, supported by large stone columns, on the southern-facing front of the house; an enclosed porch, smaller but two stories high and supported by wooden pillars, {{is located on the}} rear portion of the house's east side. Projecting {{from the front of the}} house, above the porch, is a small wing with a gable, semicircular window, and elaborate cornice. The house is built in a combination of styles; it includes many Italianate details, but its design appears to have been influenced by the architecture of the Sears Modern Homes.|$|E
5|$|Dr. John Markway narrates {{the history}} of the 90-year-old Hill House, which was {{constructed}} by Hugh Crain as a home for his wife. She died when her carriage crashed against a tree as she approached the house for the first time.

Hill House was eventually inherited by a Mrs. Sanderson, although it has stood empty for some time.|$|E

The influential club already owned most of {{the block}} north of the Tayloe House, and was expanding rapidly. It valued the home at $60,000 and the furnishings at an additional $5,000. The Cosmos Club declined to buy the home after an investigation found {{that the cost of}} upgrading the Tayloe property for its use would be too costly.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>house</b> {{was built}} about 1849, and typifies <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> that {{were built in}} the {{immediate}} area in the 1840s, although it is now one of <b>the</b> few <b>houses</b> left <b>from</b> that period. Most of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>from</b> that period have been replaced either by later residential construction or commercial buildings. <b>The</b> <b>house's</b> first known occupant was S. D.

5|$|Modern {{visitors}} typically enter <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>from</b> the High Street to the south, {{passing through}} the gatehouse, across the lower courtyard into the hall of the main building. Plas Mawr's gatehouse was only the third such entrance building {{to be built in}} North Wales, despite gatehouses being an important part of English Elizabethan architecture, designed to show off the house and provide a suitably dignified entry for visitors. Few houses in towns had the physical space for a gatehouse like Plas Mawr's. Originally, the gatehouse would have contained a suite of rooms for the steward of the house, Richard Wynn.|$|E

5|$|The Blathwayt {{family owned}} the house until 1956, when the {{government}} acquired it, but during the Second World War it was used for child evacuees while rented by Lady Anne Islington, the wife of John Dickson-Poynder, 1st Baron Islington, who redecorated many of the rooms. The National Trust acquired it in 1961. In 2015 major renovation work, costing £3.8 million, included replacing the roof. Part of the cost was met from a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of £85,000.

50|$|The {{present day}} Hindu astrology favours {{the use of}} the Vimshottari dasha system along with the Gochara system for the purpose of prognostication and for the timing of events.The correct {{determination}} of longevity, and the timing of death is a difficult. Parasara states that <b>the</b> 8th <b>house</b> counted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> occupied by Saturn at the time of birth is the Mrityu-bhava or <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Death. Add up the number of Rekhas contributed by Saturn in <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lagna to that occupied by Saturn, this figure will indicate the age at which adversity will strike the native; add up the rekhas contributed by Saturn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> occupied by Saturn to lagna, this figure will indicate the age at which the native will suffer most severe physical adversity, and even death if so indicated by the maraka-dasha operating. Alternatively, add the number of rekhas contributed by Saturn in <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> occupied by it to the Mrityu-bhava, multiply this figure by the Yoga-pinda and divide by 27 the remainder will indicate the nakshatra transiting which or the trine nakshatra therefrom Saturn will cause death, or add the number of rekhas contributed by Saturn in <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> occupied by it to the Mrityu-bhava, multiply this figure by the Yoga-pinda and divide by 12 the remainder will indicate the sign or its trine that will be transited by Saturn at the time of death.|$|R
50|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> have roofs {{that are}} tiled {{with a special}} sea-stone called marla.

5|$|The British Government {{purchased}} Hillingdon House in 1915 and {{it became}} a military hospital. In 1917, what would become the Royal Air Force station RAF Uxbridge was established within the grounds. In military use, the house has served over time as the first headquarters for No. 11 Group RAF and RAF Bomber Command.

5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{case was}} that Bamber, motivated by hatred and greed, had left White House Farm around 10pm on 6 August 1985, after dining with his family, {{to drive to}} his home in Head Street, Goldhanger.

He had entered the house through a downstairs bathroom window, taken the rifle with the silencer attached, and gone upstairs.|$|E
