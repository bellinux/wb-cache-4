5|$|During 2006, Teaneck {{underwent}} a revaluation of all privately owned real estate, as required periodically by the state. This revaluation adjusted property values to market prices, ensuring that taxes are equitably allocated. The average property in Teaneck was assessed at approximately $417,900, {{an increase of}} 132.1% from the prior year's average. The new valuations took effect for the 2007 <b>tax</b> <b>year.</b> In {{the wake of the}} revaluation implemented in 2007, a wave of tax appeals hit the township, resulting in a loss of about $110 million in ratables and costs to the township of $2.2 million for the 2012 <b>tax</b> <b>year.</b> The township agreed to complete a revaluation by October 2014 that would go into effect in 2015, awarding a $710,000 contract to perform the necessary home visits and determine property values.|$|E

25|$|A Roth 401(k) plan is {{probably}} most advantageous {{to those who}} might otherwise choose a Roth IRA, such as younger workers who are currently taxed in a lower tax bracket but expect to be taxed in a higher bracket upon reaching retirement age. Higher-income workers may prefer a traditional 401(k) plan because they are currently taxed in a higher tax bracket but would expect to be taxed at a lower rate in retirement; also, those near the Roth IRA income limits may prefer a traditional 401(k) since its pre-tax contributions lowers Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and thus increases eligibility for various other tax incentives (Roth IRA contributions, the Child Tax Credit, medical expense deduction, etc.). Another consideration for those currently in higher tax brackets {{is the future of}} income tax rates in the US: if income tax rates increase, current taxation would be desirable for a wider group). The Roth 401(k) offers the advantage of tax free distribution but is not constrained by the same income limitations. For example, in <b>tax</b> <b>year</b> 2013, normal Roth IRA contributions are limited to $5,500 ($6,500 if age 50 or older); up to $17,500 could be contributed to a Roth 401(k) account if no other elective deferrals were taken for the <b>tax</b> <b>year,</b> such as traditional 401(k) deferrals.|$|E
