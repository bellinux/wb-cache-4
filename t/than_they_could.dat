5|$|Even {{after the}} chariot had become {{obsolete}} {{as a tool}} of war, there still was a need for technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses were needed to pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons. The invention of the horse collar in China during the 5th century AD (Southern and Northern Dynasties) allowed horses to pull greater weight <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> when hitched to a vehicle with the ox yokes or breast collars used in earlier times. The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century, and became widespread by the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Requisitioning disincentivised peasants from {{producing}} more grain <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> personally consume, and thus production slumped. A booming black market supplemented the official state-sanctioned economy, and Lenin called on speculators, black marketeers and looters to be shot. Both the Socialist Revolutionaries and Left Socialist Revolutionaries condemned the armed appropriations of grain at the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets in July 1918. Realising that the Committees of the Poor Peasants were also persecuting peasants {{who were not}} kulaks and thus contributing to anti-government feeling among the peasantry, in December 1918 Lenin abolished them.|$|E
5|$|At the {{strategic}} level the general uprising never eventuated, and in late February the communist offensive collapsed. Suffering more than 45,000 killed—against South Vietnamese and allied losses of only 6,000 men—it {{had been a}} tactical disaster for the communists. Regardless, the offensive {{was a turning point}} in the war. Prior to Tet American commanders and politicians had talked confidently about winning the war, arguing that Westmoreland's strategy of attrition had reached the point where the communists were losing soldiers and equipment faster <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be replaced. Yet the scale of the fighting, and the surprise and violence with which the offensive was launched, had shocked the public, contradicting such predictions of imminent victory. Confidence in the military and political leadership collapsed, as did public support for the war in America. Ultimately, Tet was a publicity and media triumph for the communists, and Hanoi emerged with a significant political victory. In its wake President Lyndon Johnson announced that he would not seek a second term in office.|$|E
50|$|In late May 1882, {{the team}} was in a tie for first place in its six-team league. They had eight games over 0.500 putting them one game behind the Cincinnati Reds. There {{followed}} a seven week period when the team lost sixteen more games <b>than</b> <b>they</b> won. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> not contend for the championship.|$|R

50|$|The Primacy of Self-Discovery {{states that}} {{learning}} happens best with emotion, challenge and the requisite support. People discover their abilities, values, passions, and responsibilities in situations that offer adventure and the unexpected. The primary {{task of the}} teacher is to help students overcome their fears and discover they can do more <b>than</b> <b>they</b> thought <b>they</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R
5|$|Females who {{participate}} in extra-pair fertilizations may incorporate better genes in their offspring <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> get with their social mate, but {{they are likely to}} receive less help with parental care from their social mates because of cheating. Extra-pair fertilization, therefore, can be costly to females as well. A possible theory why extra-pair fertilization occurs is that female organisms select males with overall high heterozygosity or dissimilar genetics from themselves. A microsatellite study suggests an alternative to heterozygosity selection. Because no correlation is found between female extra-pair fertilization frequencies and the overall heterozygosity of their social mates, it is suggested that females may choose only a selective set of heterozygous genes, particularly the MHC locus, which can affect the immunocompetence of offspring.|$|E
5|$|Petrodollar {{recycling}} {{is the international}} spending or investment of a country's revenues from petroleum exports ("petrodollars"). It generally refers to the phenomenon of major petroleum-exporting nations, mainly the OPEC members plus Russia and Norway, earning more money from the export of crude oil <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> efficiently invest in their own economies. The resulting global interdependencies and financial flows, from oil producers back to oil consumers, can reach a scale of {{hundreds of billions of}} US dollars per year – including a wide range of transactions in a variety of currencies, some pegged to the US dollar and some not. These flows are heavily influenced by government-level decisions regarding international investment and aid, with important consequences for both global finance and petroleum politics. The phenomenon is most pronounced during periods when the price of oil is historically high. The first major petrodollar surge (1974–1981) resulted in more financial complications than the second (2005–2014).|$|E
5|$|The Godwins were {{constantly}} in debt, so Godwin returned to writing {{to support the}} family. He and his wife started a Juvenile Library for which he wrote children's books. In 1807, when Fanny was 13, they moved from the Polygon, where Godwin had lived with Wollstonecraft, to 41 Skinner Street, near Clerkenwell, in the city's bookselling district. This took the family away from the fresh country air and into the dirty, smelly, inner streets of London. Although initially successful, the business gradually failed. The Godwins also continued to borrow more money <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> afford from generous friends such as publisher Joseph Johnson and Godwin devotee Francis Place.|$|E
30|$|The rebellious Sherwood was {{uniform and}} {{unknown to the}} Nottingham Sheriff’s troops: {{it was just a}} generic Forest. Instead, Robin’s merry men knew how to {{distinguish}} and refer to many places such as meadows, groves, creeks, glens, brooks, canyons, orchards, glades to which <b>they</b> <b>could</b> give proper names. And, much more <b>than</b> this, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> move around without getting lost because <b>they</b> <b>could</b> see the differences.|$|R
50|$|With {{long and}} low bodies, {{relatively}} short limbs, their elongated rostrum, Remingtonocetids looked like mammalian crocodiles, more so <b>than</b> Ambulocetus. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> both walk {{on land and}} swim {{in the water and}} most likely lived in a near-shore habitat. At least one genus, Dalanistes, had a marine diet.|$|R
60|$|Both {{the girls}} felt their faces glow and their pulses throb; both {{knew they would}} do no good by rushing down into the mêlée. They desired neither to deal nor to receive blows; but <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not have run away--Caroline no more <b>than</b> Shirley; <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not have fainted; <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not have taken their eyes from the dim, terrible scene--from the mass of cloud, of smoke, the musket-lightning--for the world.|$|R
5|$|The average horse {{can carry}} up to {{approximately}} 30% {{of its body}} weight. While all horses can pull more than they can carry, the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the type of vehicle, road conditions, and other factors. Horses harnessed to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight, but far less if pulling wheelless loads over unpaved terrain. Thus, horses that were driven varied in size and {{had to make a}} trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals. Light horses could pull a small war chariot at speed. Heavy supply wagons, artillery, and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or a larger number of horses. The method by which a horse was hitched to a vehicle also mattered: horses could pull greater weight with a horse collar <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> with a breast collar, and even less with an ox yoke.|$|E

Prior to Tet, American commanders and politicians had talked confidently about winning the war, arguing that General William Westmoreland's strategy of attrition had reached the point where the communists were losing soldiers and equipment faster <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be replaced. Yet the scale of the offensive, and the surprise and violence with which it had been launched, had shocked the American public and contradicted such predictions of imminent victory; in its wake President Lyndon Johnson announced that he would no longer seek a second term in office. Tet had a similar effect on Australian public opinion, and caused growing uncertainty in the government about the determination of the United States to remain militarily involved in Southeast Asia. Amid the initial shock, Prime Minister John Gorton unexpectedly declared that Australia would not increase its military commitment in Vietnam beyond the current level of 8,000 personnel.|$|E

50|$|High {{mortality}} rates and pre-modern sanitary conditions made urban regions net population sinks, with more local deaths <b>than</b> births. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> only be sustained by constant immigration. The large cities provided a major stimulus to demand, {{and not only}} for agricultural products, but for manufactured goods and luxury items as well.|$|R
50|$|Typically the feudal armies {{consisted}} of a core of highly skilled knights and their household troops, mercenaries hired for {{the time of the}} campaign and feudal levies fulfilling their feudal obligations, who usually were little more <b>than</b> rabble. <b>They</b> <b>could,</b> however, be efficient in disadvantageous terrain. Towns and cities could also field militias.|$|R

25|$|In 1925, Spedan Lewis {{devised the}} slogan 'never knowingly undersold' at Peter Jones. Intended mainly {{as a control}} on {{sourcing}} merchandise, it also meant that customers could shop knowing {{that they were not}} paying more at Peter Jones <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> buy identical goods for at other stores. Trade improved and profit sharing was resumed.|$|E
25|$|The Provisional Army of the Confederate States (PACS) began {{organizing}} on April 27. Virtually all regular, volunteer, and conscripted men {{preferred to}} enter this organization since officers could achieve a higher {{rank in the}} Provisional Army <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> in the Regular Army. If the war had ended successfully for them, the Confederates intended that the PACS would be disbanded, leaving only the ACSA.|$|E
25|$|Another {{unexpected}} {{element of}} the series was {{the emergence of a}} West Indian side. The concept was originally envisaged as Australia versus the rest of the world. When the West Indians were offered contracts that would pay them more <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> earn in an entire career, they all signed with alacrity. However, WSC used the West Indian players in the World team as well.|$|E

50|$|Thomas Gilovich, Kenneth Savitsky, and Victoria Husted Medvec {{believe that}} this {{phenomenon}} is partially {{the reason for the}} bystander effect. They found that concern or alarm were not as apparent to observers as the individual experiencing them thought, and that people believed {{they would be able to}} read others' expressions better <b>than</b> <b>they</b> actually <b>could.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} factor in the decline of serfdom was industrial development—especially the Industrial Revolution. With the growing profitability of industry, farmers wanted to move to towns to receive higher wages <b>than</b> those <b>they</b> <b>could</b> earn working in the fields, while landowners also invested in the more profitable industry. This also led to the growing process of urbanization.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, {{local leaders}} were {{pressured}} into falsely reporting ever-higher grain production figures to their political superiors. Participants at political meetings remembered production figures being inflated up to 10 times actual production amounts as {{the race to}} please superiors and win plaudits—like the chance to meet Mao himself—intensified. The state was later able to force many production groups to sell more grain <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> spare based on these false production figures.|$|E
25|$|The first post-war {{expedition}} was {{overseen by}} a US naval officer, Lieutenant David McCracken, and observed by Australian Kenneth Coonan. Coonan expressed disapproval of McCracken in his reports of violated regulations and waste dumped {{over the side}} when the fleet began killing whales faster <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be processed. McCracken even briefly joined in whaling with the Japanese crew of a whale catcher and detailed the trip in his 1948 book, Four Months on a Jap Whaler.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, these created {{problems}} for some banks {{as the high}} inflation of that period resulted in them borrowing money at higher rates <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> lend it. In response to this asset liability mismatch, libertarians and free-market advocates called for interest rate caps to be increased or repealed entirely as an unreasonable restriction on market forces. Bills to do so were introduced in Congress and some state legislatures. Some succeeded in the former goal, but those that sought to eliminate interest rate caps entirely failed.|$|E

In quantum cryptography, entangled particles are used to transmit signals that cannot be eavesdropped upon without leaving a trace.

25|$|Writers in a {{specialized}} field {{or with a}} narrower appeal have found smaller alternatives to the mass market {{in the form of}} small presses and self-publishing. More recently, these options include print on demand and ebook format. These publishing alternatives provide an avenue for authors who believe that mainstream publishing will not meet their needs or who {{are in a position to}} make more money from direct sales <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> from bookstore sales, such as popular speakers who sell books after speeches. Authors are more readily published by this means due to the much lower costs involved.|$|E
25|$|Plague of Athens, 430 BC. Possibly {{typhoid fever}} killed {{a quarter of}} the Athenian troops, and {{a quarter of the}} {{population}} over four years. This disease fatally weakened the dominance of Athens, but the sheer virulence of the disease prevented its wider spread; i.e. it killed off its hosts at a rate faster <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> spread it. The exact cause of the plague was unknown for many years. In January 2006, researchers from the University of Athens analyzed teeth recovered from a mass grave underneath the city, and confirmed the presence of bacteria responsible for typhoid.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the mat {{took about}} 50 men four weeks to complete. By {{the end of}} January 1941 only 10 sites had been upgraded, {{and all the while}} new AA emplacements were being set up so that the number of {{prospective}} sites was increasing more rapidly <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be completed. By April, Pile had concluded that 95% of the AA sites would need the mats, and they expected 600 sites to be operational by March 1942. The program ultimately ran on for years, petering out as new systems were introduced that did not require the mats. The mat program formally ended in March 1943.|$|E
