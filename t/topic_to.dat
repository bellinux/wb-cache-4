However, concerns exist about this methodology {{in regards to}} animal husbandry, conservation benefits, and other issues.

25|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} {{in the evolution of}} sclerotherapy was the advent of duplex ultrasonography in the 1980s and its incorporation into the practise of sclerotherapy later that decade.

25|$|Another <b>topic</b> <b>to</b> which Wren contributed was optics. He {{published}} {{a description of}} an engine to create perspective drawings and he discussed the grinding of conical lenses and mirrors. Out of this work came another of Wren's important mathematical results, namely that the hyperboloid of revolution is a ruled surface. These results were published in 1669. In subsequent years, Wren continued with his work with the Royal Society, although after the 1680s his scientific interests seem to have waned: no doubt his architectural and official duties absorbed more time.|$|E
25|$|Statistics {{on poverty}} in the kingdom are not {{available}} through the UN resources because the Saudi government does not issue any. The Saudi state discourages calling attention to or complaining about poverty. In December 2011, the Saudi interior ministry arrested three reporters and held them for almost two weeks for questioning after they uploaded a video on the <b>topic</b> <b>to</b> YouTube. Authors of the video claim that 22% of Saudis may be considered poor (2009). Observers researching the issue prefer to stay anonymous {{because of the risk}} of being arrested.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, Lee was financially {{supported}} by the Economic Cooperation Administration (美援會) and {{was sent to the}} University of Pennsylvania Medical School for further education. This was his first time studying abroad. Lee originally wanted to do research on the circulatory system, but because of the limitation of time, his instructor Carl F. Schmidt suggested that he change his <b>topic</b> <b>to</b> pulmonary circulation. After researching at the University of Pennsylvania, he transferred to the Wayne State University in Detroit, where he visited Walter Segeers's lab for two months and published a small-sized research paper.|$|E

Initially the team who correctly answered the question also won the right to be the first team to get their question round, but was later dropped. No points are lost if a team answers the question incorrectly, but will be locked out in the next question. Should this happen, another question would be asked by Reeve for the remaining teams.|$|E
25|$|DIA's harsh {{interrogation}} methods {{at times}} paled {{in comparison to}} those of some U.S. special operations forces. In 2004, interrogations by Joint Special Operations Command's high-value targets special operations task forces (including Task Force 6-26) were so heavy-handed and physical with the detainees that two DIA officials complained, {{as a result of}} which they were threatened and put under surveillance by abusive military interrogators. The two DIA officials managed to share their accounts of abuse with the agency leadership, prompting DIA Director Lowell Jacoby to write a memo on this <b>topic</b> <b>to</b> the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} year Galois' first paper, on continued fractions, was published. It was at {{around the same time}} that he began making fundamental discoveries in the theory of polynomial equations. He submitted two papers on this <b>topic</b> <b>to</b> the Academy of Sciences. Augustin-Louis Cauchy refereed these papers, but refused to accept them for publication for reasons that still remain unclear. However, in spite of many claims to the contrary, it is widely held that Cauchy recognized the importance of Galois' work, and that he merely suggested combining the two papers into one in order to enter it in the competition for the Academy's Grand Prize in Mathematics. Cauchy, an eminent mathematician of the time, though with political views that were at the opposite end from Galois', considered Galois' work to be a likely winner.|$|E
25|$|In November 1839 Cauchy {{was elected}} to the Bureau, and {{discovered}} immediately that the matter of the oath was not so easily dispensed with. Without his oath, the king refused to approve his election. For four years Cauchy was in the absurd position of being elected, but not being approved; hence, he was not a formal member of the Bureau, did not receive payment, could not participate in meetings, and could not submit papers. Still Cauchy refused to take any oaths; however, he did feel loyal enough to direct his research to celestial mechanics. In 1840, he presented a dozen papers on this <b>topic</b> <b>to</b> the Academy. He also described and illustrated the signed-digit representation of numbers, an innovation presented in England in 1727 by John Colson. The confounded membership of the Bureau lasted until the end of 1843, when Cauchy was finally replaced by Poinsot.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of Orthodox and some Conservative Jews reject {{the idea that}} a woman can publicly read from the Torah or lead prayer services whenever there is a minyan (quorum of 10 males) available to do so. However, the public celebration of a girl becoming bat mitzvah in other ways has made strong inroads into Modern Orthodox Judaism and also into some elements of Haredi Judaism. In these congregations, women do not read from the Torah or lead prayer services, but they occasionally lecture on a Jewish <b>topic</b> <b>to</b> mark their coming of age, learn a book of Tanakh, recite verses from the Book of Esther or the Book of Psalms, or say prayers from the siddur. In some Modern Orthodox circles, bat mitzvah girls will read from the Torah and lead prayer services in a women's tefillah. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, a prominent Orthodox posek, has ruled that bat mitzvah celebrations are permissible, but should not be held in a synagogue, because then they would be construed as imitating Reform and Conservative customs; in any case, {{they do not have the}} status of seudat mitzvah. Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef holds that it is a seudat mitzvah.|$|E
