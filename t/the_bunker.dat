5|$|A small {{detachment}} of men performs a reconnaissance mission on Tall's orders {{to determine the}} strength of the Japanese bunker. Private Bell reports there are five machine guns in <b>the</b> <b>bunker.</b> He joins another small team of men (including Witt), led by Captain John Gaff, on a flanking mission to take <b>the</b> <b>bunker.</b> The operation is a success and C Company overruns one of the last Japanese strongholds on the island. The Japanese they find are largely malnourished and dying, and put up little resistance.|$|E
5|$|At 01:00 the Soviet forces {{picked up}} a radio message from the LVI Panzer Corps {{requesting}} a cease-fire. Down in the Führerbunker, General Krebs and General Burgdorf committed suicide by gunshot to the head. The last defenders {{in the area of}} <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> complex, French SS volunteers of the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French) remained until the early morning. The Soviet forces then captured the Reich Chancellery. General Weidling surrendered with his staff at 6:00 and his meeting with Chuikov ended at 8:23. Johannes Hentschel, the master electro-mechanic for <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> complex, stayed after everyone else had either committed suicide or left, as the field hospital in the Reich Chancellery above needed power and water. He surrendered to the Red Army as they entered <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> complex at 09:00 on 2 May. The bodies of Goebbels' six children were discovered on 3 May. They were found in their beds in the Vorbunker, with the clear mark of cyanide shown on their faces.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bunkers</b> {{were built}} in 1943 and after the {{landings}} in Normandy, on 29 August 1944, {{a few days before}} the liberation of Antwerp, <b>the</b> <b>bunkers</b> were abandoned by General von und zu Gilsa and his staff. After the war, in particular on 1 July 1947, all the furniture and equipment both inside and outside <b>the</b> <b>bunkers</b> were sold through auction. Afterwards, on 19 July 1947, plans were drawn up to demolish <b>the</b> <b>bunkers</b> but <b>the</b> plans were called back on March 20, 1948.|$|R

50|$|Inside of <b>the</b> <b>bunkers,</b> {{escape hatch}} {{measuring}} one meter in diameters runs horizontally for 5 meters and then perpendicularly until the surface {{on the top}} of <b>the</b> <b>bunkers.</b> <b>The</b> metal structure and additional brick has been constructed on the slope to make escape easy under possible explosion or fire. In addition, “breather pipe” has been built to open up into a hidden structure above the slope for the case in which the troops be trapped inside of <b>the</b> <b>bunkers.</b>|$|R
5|$|Moving {{to support}} the platoon in contact, Scott ordered D Company to conduct an assault against the flank and rear of <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> complex, mounted in APCs with tanks in support. Two troops of Centurions spearheaded the assault through the jungle from the north, and they soon began {{receiving}} heavy small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades, one of which subsequently suffered external damage. Realising that <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> system was larger than previously estimated, the tanks were forced to halt while the infantry were brought up to begin the assault.|$|E
5|$|No further {{military}} use {{was made}} of <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> and the land on which it stands reverted to private ownership. It was left abandoned for many years before the owners decided to redevelop the site. In 1973, <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> was {{opened to the public}} for the first time under the name of Le Blockhaus d'Éperlecques. The ownership was taken over by Hubert de Mégille in the mid-1980s and on 3 September 1986 the French state declared it a monument historique. The area around <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> has been re-forested, though it is still heavily scarred by bomb craters, and various items of Second World War military equipment (including a V-1 on a launch ramp) are on display alongside paths around the site. An open-air trail leads to and around <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> with interpretative signs posted at various points {{to tell the story of}} the site and the German V-weapons programme. In 2009, the museum welcomed 45,000 visitors.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 2006, {{during the}} lead-up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, an {{information}} board was installed {{to mark the}} location of the Führerbunker. The board, including a schematic diagram of <b>the</b> <b>bunker,</b> {{can be found at the}} corner of In den Ministergärten and Gertrud-Kolmar-Straße, two small streets about three minutes' walk from Potsdamer Platz. Hitler's bodyguard, Rochus Misch, one of the last people living who was in <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> at the time of Hitler's suicide, was on hand for the ceremony.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bunkers</b> {{were still}} fitted with guns, which proved {{inadequate}} {{in the first}} war years and were therefore dismantled, but the large-calibre weapons necessary for efficient defence could not be built into <b>the</b> <b>bunkers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In late 1939 {{and early}} 1940 the Soviets carried out {{detailed}} {{investigations of the}} defence works. In mid-1940s, <b>the</b> <b>bunkers</b> served as a hideout for Ukrainian nationalist partisans of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. Today, <b>the</b> <b>bunkers</b> are in ruin.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bunkers</b> were {{purchased}} and successively renovated by the municipality of Putgarten. <b>The</b> Arkona <b>Bunker</b> now houses {{an art gallery}} and <b>the</b> NVA <b>Bunker</b> an exhibition of GDR fittings and equipment {{as well as a}} series of photographs on the Volksmarine.|$|R

5|$|The {{ruins of}} both Chancellery {{buildings}} were levelled by the Soviets between 1945 and 1949 {{as part of}} an effort to destroy the landmarks of Nazi Germany. <b>The</b> <b>bunker</b> largely survived, although some areas were partially flooded. In December 1947, the Soviets tried to blow up <b>the</b> <b>bunker,</b> but only the separation walls were damaged. In 1959, the East German government began a series of demolitions of the Chancellery, including <b>the</b> <b>bunker.</b> Because it was near the Berlin Wall, the site was undeveloped and neglected until 1988–89. During extensive construction of residential housing and other buildings on the site, work crews uncovered several underground sections of the old bunker complex; for the most part these were destroyed. Other parts of the Chancellery underground complex were uncovered, but these were ignored, filled in, or resealed.|$|E
30|$|First of all, company-specific open {{questions}} are asked, about how <b>the</b> <b>bunkering</b> is dealt with within the respondent’s company. It is asked who {{the decision maker}} is and how they deal with <b>the</b> <b>bunkering</b> decisions. In <b>the</b> form of open questions, it is also asked what the shipping company considers when <b>the</b> <b>bunkering</b> decision is made in favour of a certain port. The responses to these questions give a perception on what is considered when those choices are made.|$|R
30|$|Data for {{a certain}} company may be unavailable. For example, a company may, for some reason or other, choose not to report its <b>bunkering</b> {{activity}} to <b>the</b> port authorities. Therefore, as a second step in the approach, we estimate <b>the</b> <b>bunkering</b> volumes for companies where factor calculation is impossible. One of the data sources may lack data on a specific company, e.g. customs data may have been accidentally omitted by the administration. To estimate <b>the</b> <b>bunkering</b> volume for such a company, {{it is assumed that}} the volume reported in the customs data is accurate. If no volume is reported in the customs data, we rely on <b>the</b> <b>bunkering</b> volume reported in <b>the</b> <b>bunkering</b> data of <b>the</b> PoA.|$|R
50|$|In 2009 <b>the</b> final <b>bunkers</b> were demolished. However, {{the scars}} of <b>the</b> <b>bunkers</b> and runways can still {{be seen from the}} M62 motorway.|$|R
5|$|After {{their water}} ran out, the Beck/Fiszer group {{developed}} a routine whereby {{some of the}} group worked to dig a well, while others watched out for approaching Germans, and yet others ventured outside <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> to scavenge for useful items. The group eventually dug their way to two water canals and built a well. On November 17, during an excursion outside <b>the</b> <b>bunker,</b> the group made contact with a small partisan unit, also in hiding, led by a Russian soldier POW who had been liberated during the uprising. Subsequently, several of the group would join the partisans for small scale attacks on German troops. The group survived until the entry of the Red Army in mid-January.|$|E
5|$|By mid-afternoon, D Company {{had finally}} moved into {{position}} and commenced an assault, pushing through <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> {{system from the}} north-east with the Centurion tanks in close support crushing many bunkers and their occupants with their tracks. The progress of the Australian assault was slowed by thick vegetation {{and the size of}} the position, even as the resistance slackened and volume of fire diminished. Indeed, <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> system was later found to cover nearly a square kilometre and was wider than the front of the assaulting company. Painstakingly the Australians searched each bunker systematically. With the action now over, D Company and the tanks subsequently linked up with B Company and established a night defensive position.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{moved into}} the Führerbunker on 16 January 1945. He was joined by his senior staff, {{including}} Martin Bormann. In April 1945, Eva Braun and Joseph Goebbels {{moved into the}} Führerbunker while Magda Goebbels and their six children took residence in the upper Vorbunker. Two or three dozen support, medical, and administrative staff were also sheltered there. These included Hitler's secretaries (including Traudl Junge), a nurse named Erna Flegel, and telephone switchboard operator Sergeant Rochus Misch. Early on, Hitler continued to utilize the undamaged wing of the Reich Chancellery, where he held afternoon military conferences in his large study. Afterwards, he would have tea with his secretaries before going back down into <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> complex for the night. After several weeks of this routine, Hitler seldom left <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> except for short strolls in the chancellery garden with his dog Blondi. <b>The</b> <b>bunker</b> was crowded and the atmosphere was oppressive; air raids occurred daily. Hitler mostly stayed on the lower level, where it was quieter and he could sleep. Conferences took place {{for much of the}} night, often until 05:00.|$|E
30|$|The {{research}} allows understanding by whom and how <b>the</b> <b>bunkering</b> {{decisions are}} made. It also allows determining {{the most important}} attributes of <b>the</b> <b>bunkering</b> choice. It {{turns out that the}} price of fuel and the trust that the correct quality and quantity of fuel is <b>bunkered</b> are <b>the</b> most important determinants of <b>the</b> <b>bunkering</b> choice. <b>The</b> other determinants which are related to the other costs during a port call and the market fit with the location of the port were of less importance. This confirms the results of other studies on bunkering choice determinants.|$|R

50|$|The fort is on {{the hill}} Storbakken, the highest point of Spåkenes. The work to build <b>the</b> <b>bunkers</b> there began in 1941.

5|$|Other {{scientists}} {{working for}} Davros, now {{aware of his}} plans, free the Doctor and give him enough time to rig the Dalek incubation room with explosives which would end {{the threat of the}} Daleks. As he is about to touch the two exposed wire ends to set them off, the Doctor questions if he has the right to make that decision and forgoes setting the explosions off. Just then, he learns that Davros has agreed to stop and allow the Kaled leaders to vote on the continuation of the project. As the leaders gather for this vote, the Doctor is able to recover the Time Ring and destroy the recordings he made, while learning that the Thals and Mutos have prepared the means to destroy <b>the</b> <b>bunker.</b> As the vote is called, Davros reveals this was all a decoy, giving the Daleks he sent to the Thal time to return to <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> and exterminate the remaining Kaleds. Harry and Sarah escape the chaos, while the Doctor returns to set off the incubator room's explosives, but a Dalek inadvertently completes the circuit and sets it off itself. The Doctor escapes in time before the Thal and Mutos' bomb caves in <b>the</b> <b>bunker,</b> trapping Davros and the Daleks. Inside, Davros realises the Daleks have gained a will of their own, and attempts to stop the production line, but a Dalek incapacitates him.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 80 {{percent of the}} Abrahams Creek {{watershed}} is rural and 20 percent is urbanized. The lower reaches of the watershed contain most of the urbanization. Its upper reaches contain second-growth forest, small patches of residential land, linear hedgerows, and agricultural land such as hay pastures, pastures, and farmland. <b>The</b> <b>Bunker</b> Hill-Mount Lookout Ridge is too steep to be developed, but many {{other areas of the}} watershed could easily be urbanized.

5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to assassinate President Dale, the Martians invade Earth, {{starting}} with Washington, D.C. As they attack the White House (and incinerate the White House tour guide), the Secret Service evacuates the President, but the First Lady Marsha is crushed to death by the Nancy Reagan chandelier. Taffy vanishes during the chaos. After the U.S. government unsuccessfully attempts a nuclear attack on the mother ship, the Martians expand their invasion {{to the rest of}} Earth, defacing world landmarks for their own amusement as they do so. That night, the Martians breach <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> where Dale has been taken and the leader reduces Decker to the size of an insect before killing him. The Martians kill everyone else in <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> except for Dale, who makes an impassioned speech in an attempt to plea for peace and his life. The Martians seem convinced, but then use a false hand to kill the President.|$|E
5|$|After {{midnight on}} 29 April, with the Soviets {{advancing}} {{ever closer to}} <b>the</b> <b>bunker</b> complex, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony within the Führerbunker.
