5|$|A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle {{went on to}} {{face each}} other in a Last Man Standing match at Hard Justice. This bout was {{announced}} on the July31 episode of Impact!, when Styles challenged Angle to a match at Hard Justice to end their rivalry. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> Angle assaulting Styles from behind earlier in the episode. Styles defeated Angle at the event.|$|E
5|$|After {{affecting}} Puerto Rico, {{the hurricane}} passed {{just north of}} the Dominican Republic, producing very little damage. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the small core and weaker winds to the south of the center.

The {{music on the}} album covers Chapters 1 to 3. According to Suzuki, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the music feeling like it had reached a natural transition point by that stage of the game.|$|E
5|$|Became {{the first}} player in history with more times on base (376) than {{official}} at-bats (373) in 2004. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the record number of walks, which count as a time on base but not an at-bat. He had 135 hits, 232 walks, and 9 hit-by-pitches for the 376 number.|$|E
5|$|Burkard von Müllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann for {{the last}} time at around 08:00 on the command bridge just prior to the final battle. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg {{described}} the normally intelligent, humorous and optimistic Lindemann now as pessimistic and withdrawn. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg tried to talk to him and was ignored, and later wondered whether <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> combat fatigue or whether the disagreements with Lütjens had worn him down.|$|E

In {{the early days}} of the conflict the trail was used strictly for the infiltration of manpower. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the fact that Hanoi could supply its southern allies much more efficiently by sea.|$|E
5|$|Churchill's and the British {{response}} was officially restrained. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the strong-willed defence of the Belgian defensive campaign {{presented to the}} cabinet by Sir Roger Keyes at 11:30am 28 May. The French and Belgian ministers had referred to Leopold's actions as treacherous, but they were unaware of the true events: Leopold had not {{signed an agreement with}} Hitler in order to form a collaborative government, but an unconditional surrender as Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|Dalton also {{believed}} atomic theory {{could explain why}} water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, he found that water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen. Dalton hypothesized <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{the differences between the}} masses and configurations of the gases' respective particles, and carbon dioxide molecules (CO2) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N2).|$|E

5|$|In March 2015 {{the team}} {{confirmed}} that Riis {{had been removed}} from active duty due to differences between Riis and Tinkov. Media reports had initially indicated that Riis had been suspended when he did not appear at the 2015 Milan–San Remo as planned, and that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a disappointing start to the season for the team. His departure from the team was officially announced on 29 March.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, as he {{was writing}} Parts II and IV, Joyce's {{progress}} slowed considerably. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{a number of factors}} including {{the death of his father}} John Stanislaus Joyce in 1931; concern over the mental health of his daughter Lucia; and his own health problems, chiefly his failing eyesight.|$|E

5|$|Lem {{singled out}} only one American science fiction writer for praise, Philip K. Dick, {{for example in}} his 1986 English-language {{anthology}} of his critical essays, Microworlds. In fact, initially Lem held an equally low opinion of Philip K. Dick together with the bulk of American science fiction, explaining later <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> limited familiarity with Dick's work.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia Airlines retired the Flight 370 (MH370) {{flight number}} and {{replaced}} it with Flight 318 (MH318) beginning 14 March.
