He invited Donovan and Williams, who had been studying music at the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE, to join him; <b>they</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> asked classmate Edmondo Ammendola to join in. The band took their name from the 1954 novel The Adventures of Augie March by Saul Bellow, citing its poetic, complex prose {{as a reflection of}} Richards' vocals.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} the broader {{evolutionary}} relationships between the giant freshwater whipray {{and the rest of}} the family Dasyatidae, a 2012 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial DNA reported that it was most closely related to the porcupine ray (Urogymnus asperrimus), and that <b>they</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> formed a clade with the mangrove whipray (H. granulata) and the tubemouth whipray (H. lobistoma). This finding adds to a growing consensus that the genus Himantura is paraphyletic.|$|E
5|$|Some larvae, {{especially}} those of the Lycaenidae, form mutual associations with ants. They communicate with the ants using vibrations that are transmitted through the substrate as well as using chemical signals. The ants provide some degree of protection to these larvae and <b>they</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> gather honeydew secretions. Large blue (Phengaris arion) caterpillars trick Myrmica ants into taking {{them back to the}} ant colony where they feed on the ant eggs and larvae in a parasitic relationship.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{air strikes}} over Belgian air space {{were to be}} {{conducted}} by IV. Fliegerkorps under General der Flieger Generaloberst Alfred Keller. Keller's force consisted of Lehrgeschwader 1 (Stab. I., II., III., IV.), Kampfgeschwader 30 (Stab. I., II., III.) and Kampfgeschwader 27 (III.). On 10 May Keller had 363 aircraft (224 serviceable) augmented by Generalmajor Wolfram von Richthofen's VIII. Fliegerkorps with 550 (420 serviceable) aircraft. <b>They</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> were supported by Oberst Kurt-Bertram von Döring's Jagdfliegerführer 2, with 462 fighters (313 serviceable).|$|E
5|$|In Neuer's debut for Newark, {{he allowed}} nine walks, eight runs, and made two errors; his {{pitching}} was noted as the direct {{cause of the}} 8–5 loss. By the beginning of June, Newark returned him to New York; in his short time in the Eastern League, Neuer set the record for most strikeouts in a game and most walks in a game, with 13 each. Griffith sent him back to Newark almost immediately, and <b>they</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> {{sent him to the}} Toronto Maple Leafs, who in turn released him. He then signed with the Little Rock Travelers of the Southern Association, and pitched for them before being released on August 1.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} team {{struggled in}} devising gameplay features {{that would be}} enjoyed by the fans of the series. One of the hardest tasks chief director Kiyoshi Mizuki was assigned {{to do was to}} attract people who had no prior experience with the series; he decided to make the gameplay as simple as possible. Producer Shigeru Miyamoto presented the staff with a variety of opinions which <b>they</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> would have to incorporate into the game the best way possible. Miyamoto let the team decide which graphics they wanted to use without restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The early {{nuclear weapons}} were large, complex and cumbersome. They were stored as {{components}} rather than complete devices and required expert knowledge to assemble. The short {{life of their}} lead-acid batteries and modulated neutron initiators, and the heat generated by the fissile cores, precluded storing them assembled. The large quantity of conventional explosive in each weapon demanded special care be taken in handling. Groves hand-picked a team of regular Army officers, who were trained in the assembly and handling of the weapons. <b>They</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> trained the enlisted soldiers, and the Army teams then trained teams from the Navy and Air Force.|$|E

5|$|Although Henry had {{announced}} his plans at the November 1399 parliament, {{he did not}} attempt a winter campaign, but continued to hold quasi-negotiations 'in which he must have felt the Scots were profoundly irritating.' At the same time, {{it appears that the}} House of Commons was not keen on the forthcoming war, and, since extravagence had been a major complaint against Henry's predecessor, Henry was probably constrained in requesting a subsidy. At this point, parliament was clearly still opposed to a Scottish war, and may eve have believed a possible French invasion the imperative issue. In June 1400, the king summonsed his Duchy of Lancaster retainers to muster at York, and <b>they</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> brought their personal feudal retinues. At this point, with the invasion being obvious to all, the Scots attempted to re-open negotiations. Although Scottish ambassadors arrived at York to meet the king around 26 June, they returned to Scotland within two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Anderson's {{return to}} Germany {{generated}} press interest, and drew more {{members of the}} German aristocracy to her cause. She again lived itinerantly as a guest of her well-wishers. In 1932, the British tabloid News of the World published a sensational story accusing her of being a Romanian actress who was perpetrating a fraud. Her lawyer, Fallows, filed suit for libel, but the lengthy case continued until the outbreak of World War II, at which time the case was dismissed because Anderson was living in Germany, and German residents could not sue in enemy countries. From 1938, lawyers acting for Anderson in Germany contested {{the distribution of the}} Tsar's estate to his recognized relations, and <b>they</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> contested her identity. The litigation continued intermittently without resolution for decades; Lord Mountbatten footed some of his German relations' legal bills against Anderson. The protracted proceedings became the longest-running lawsuit in German history.|$|E
5|$|At 8:32a.m., FAA {{officials}} were notified Flight 11 had been hijacked and <b>they</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> notified the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). NORAD scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts {{and they were}} airborne by 8:53a.m. Because of slow and confused communication from FAA officials, NORAD had 9minutes' notice that Flight 11 had been hijacked, and no notice {{about any of the}} other flights before they crashed. After both of the Twin Towers had already been hit, more fighters were scrambled from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia at 9:30a.m. At 10:20a.m. Vice President Dick Cheney issued orders to shoot down any commercial aircraft that could be positively identified as being hijacked. These instructions were not relayed in time for the fighters to take action. Some fighters took to the air without live ammunition, knowing that to prevent the hijackers from striking their intended targets, the pilots might have to intercept and crash their fighters into the hijacked planes, possibly ejecting at the last moment.|$|E

5|$|The {{provenance}} of {{the painting}} is unclear, and there is doubt as to which painting is referred to in some early inventories. An Anhalt prince, likely Leopold Friedrich Franz (d.1817) of Wörlitz, near Dessau, Germany, held it in the early 19th century, after which {{it is likely to}} have passed to Leopold Friedrich (d.1871). The painting was loaned for exhibition in 1902, when it was shown at the Hôtel de Gouvernement Provincial, Bruges at the Exposition des primitifs flamands et d'art ancien. It was held by a Duke of Anhalt until 1926 when he sold it to the art dealers Duveen Brothers. <b>They</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> sold it that year to Andrew W. Mellon. It was loaned the following year to the Royal Academy of Arts, London, for an exhibition covering six centuries of Flemish and Belgian art. Mellon willed the work to his Educational and Charitable Trust in 1932, which in 1937 donated it to the National Gallery of Art where it is on permanent display.|$|E
5|$|During 1946–50, {{there were}} {{sporadic}} agitations against Hindi by the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) and Periyar. Whenever the government introduced Hindi as a compulsory language in schools, anti-Hindi protests happened and succeeded in stopping the move. The largest anti-Hindi imposition agitations {{in this period}} occurred in 1948–50. After India obtained independence in 1947, the Congress Government at the Centre urged all states to make Hindi compulsory in schools. The Congress Government of Madras Presidency under Omandur Ramasamy Reddiar complied and made Hindi compulsory from the academic year 1948–49. It also introduced a minimum mark qualification in Hindi {{for the promotion of}} students to higher classes. Periyar once again launched an anti-Hindi imposition agitation. The 1948 agitation was supported by former Congress nationalists like M. P. Sivagnanam and Thiru. Vi. Ka, who recanted their earlier pro-Hindi policies. On 17 July, the DK convened an all party anti-Hindi conference to oppose the compulsory Hindi teaching. As in the agitation of 1938–40, this agitation was also characterized by strikes, black flag demonstrations and anti-Hindi processions. When Rajaji (then the Governor-General of India) visited Madras on 23 August, the DK staged a black flag demonstration protesting against his visit. On 27 August, Periyar and Annadurai were arrested. The Government did not change its position on Hindi and the agitation continued. On 18 December, Periyar and other DK leaders were arrested again. A compromise was reached between the government and agitators. The government stopped the legal action against the agitators and <b>they</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> dropped the agitation on 26 December 1948. Eventually, the government made Hindi teaching optional from the academic year 1950–51. Students {{who did not want to}} learn Hindi were allowed to participate in other school activities during Hindi classes.|$|E
5|$|The Marcomannic Wars fought during 166–180 AD {{were caused}} by the {{pressure}} exerted by the northern Germanic peoples (settled around the area of today's Poland) on the tribes located {{in the vicinity of}} Roman limes, the Empire's defended border. Expansion of the Proto-Gothic Wielbark culture displaced from northern Greater Poland and Masovia the Przeworsk culture people; <b>they</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn,</b> moving south and east, crossed during the third quarter of the 2nd century the Carpathian Mountains. The ethnic composition of the Przeworsk population at this stage is not known, as the Lugii tribes no longer seem to be mentioned. Related to the Przeworsk culture was the Wietrzno-Solina type, a cultural unit with Celtic and then Dacian elements, situated within the more eastern part of the Beskids range (San River basin) during the 100–250 AD period. The Kotins tribe Celtic survivors with their Púchov culture disappeared now for good, {{as a result of their}} migration and involvement in the Marcomannic Wars. There were also changes in northwest Poland, on the border of the Elbe cultural sphere region. The Lubusz group there was absorbed by the new Luboszyce culture (Luboszyce, Krosno Odrzańskie County), that occupied the middle Oder basin during the 140–430 AD period. Its birth was related to the arrival from the east of population groups strongly influenced by the Przeworsk and Wielbark cultures. Gradually a new branch of Germanic people, the Burgundians, whose origins are traced back to Scandinavia and the Bornholm island in particular and whose ancestors then migrated to the northwest Przework culture area, developed and evolved under new favorable conditions here. On the other hand, the Gustow group left western Pomerania, to be replaced after 70 years by the Dębczyn group (Dębczyn, Wschowa County), established by the arrivals from the Elbe cultures and lasting between 210 and 450 AD.|$|E

5|$|William's {{victory at}} Karydi, {{coupled with a}} victory of his troops against the Venetians near Oreoi, brought an {{effective}} end to the conflict; on 6 August 1258, Guglielmo da Verona and Narzotto dalle Carceri consented to begin negotiations for peace through the Doge of Venice, and in early 1259, the Doge authorized the new bailo, Andrea Barozzi, to sign a treaty with William. But due to William's subsequent involvement in the great Epirote-Achaean-Sicilian alliance against the Empire of Nicaea, his defeat and capture at the Battle of Pelagonia and his captivity {{at the hands of}} the Nicaean emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1261), a final peace treaty was delayed until William's release in 1262. The treaty, signed at the residence of the Archbishop of Thebes, essentially restored the status quo ante: William recognized Guglielmo, Narzotto, and Grapella as triarchs, and <b>they</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> swore their allegiance to him. The fortress of Negroponte was razed, but Venice retained and even increased its quarter in the city, as well as retaining its exclusive right to levy customs in Euboea, except for the triarchs, the Prince, and their agents. Thus, Venice retained some of its 1256 gains, but overall the treaty was regarded as a setback, in view of the considerable expenses incurred. For some time afterwards, Venice was content to exercise her financial privileges, and refrained from meddling with the island's politics.|$|E
