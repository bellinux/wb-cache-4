40|$|This work [...] in-progress paper {{builds on}} work {{done on the}} SATINA {{platform}} and the TINA Service Architecture to outline how <b>teleworking</b> <b>services</b> can be designed for use on the Next Generation Network (NGN). The choice of an NGN platform is justified through {{a discussion of the}} problems related to packet networks currently in use, and how the NGN eliminates these problems. The multi-service nature of the NGN architectures is highlighted. The paper describes the setup of one basic service, videoconferencing, and applies TINA's composition and federation abilities to create complex <b>teleworking</b> <b>services</b> from basic services. Important features of the service design addressed here are the reuse of service components, the aggregation of services, and integration of existing services. Service federation is used to illustrate the interoperability of services that have been designed on the NGN, without having to worry about the transport technologies involved. The paper also looks at how TINA's service session management techniques allow for multi-party, multimedia <b>teleworking</b> <b>services.</b> The TINA Business Model is used for defining relationships between teleworkers, their companies, third party service providers and components available in the distributed platform.

40|$|Working in the {{information}} society is undergoing radical changes. Multimedia and telematics based tools and content services are widely considered as central ingredients for evolving new ways and means of working. Teleworking {{is the key to}} a more flexible design of working time and places of work. To reach the flexibility for working anywhere and anytime a virtual working environment is needed which is reached from any place having a browser and internet access, at home, on the road or in the office. This document first describes a set of requirements for <b>teleworking</b> <b>services.</b> These requirements are intended to guide the development of a reference architecture and provide a set of measurable constraints on implementations by which conformance can be determined. In the second part a short overview of the technology of Web Services is given and the possibilities of using Web Services to build a teleworking environment are presented...|$|E

40|$|Faculty of Engineering and Built Enviroment School of Electrical and Information Engineering 0314356 t morayus@engineer. comA <b>teleworking</b> <b>service</b> {{allows people}} to work {{effectively}} together from home or other approved locations away from the regular work site, on an established work schedule. This is made possible via the use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Presently, there are isolated applications that can assist teleworkers, such as e-mail and video conferencing, which were developed for use over the Internet. But the Internet is a best-effort network with no guarantee of Quality of service (QoS), low security and no standard billing system. The design of this <b>teleworking</b> <b>service</b> involves the integration of many existing services like e-mail, messaging, video conferencing, shared whiteboard and database access. Other requirements are for service providers interworking for service and resource usage, security, and QoS specification. Hence, we explore the emerging open service concept to create this integrated <b>teleworking</b> <b>service</b> {{that can be made}} available for subscription by corporate bodies and individuals. Service federation is the interaction between teleworkers across service provider domains. It is achieved via the interworking of providers’ services, and is an essential aspect of teleworking. We have realised a service federation in a secure and seamless manner in the OSA / Parlay environment via the use of the OSA / Parlay framework. We looked at the use of a framework federation for the actual implementation of service federation. This framework federation is an interworking of frameworks based on an agreed-upon federation contract between them. New framework interfaces were introduced to facilitate this proposed solution, as the OSA / Parlay specifications do not yet support this approach. Service composition is {{the creation of a new}} service instance by composing one or more other services. We implemented this via the use of framework and trader federation. The trader federation was used to locate services or users in different ASP domains. A high level design of the <b>teleworking</b> <b>service</b> was done with federation explored for actual implementation. The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) trading service was used to prove the concept. The RM-ODP methodology is followed in this <b>teleworking</b> <b>service</b> design. The OSA / Parlay terminal capability, generic call control, multiparty and location and Service Capability Features (SCF) were used for implementing in the CORBA Distributed Processing Environment (DPE) ...|$|R

40|$|The Netherlands has {{the second-highest}} {{broadband}} penetration at 22. 5 subscribers per 100 inhabitants (OECD, 2005). This rapid adoption process makes the Netherlands an interesting case for other countries. The main {{goal of this}} research is to gain insight in the adoption and the use of broadband internet. The research questions are presented below: Main research question (MRQ) : To what extent can developments of residential adoption and usage of broadband internet be recognized over the course of 2001 to 2005 and how can these developments be understood from a user perspective? RQ 1 What are the possibilities and limitations of (combinations of) various research methods to gain insight into the adoption and use of new technologies? RQ 2 Which developments can be recognized with regard to reasons and thresholds for residential adoption of broadband internet between 2001 and 2005 and how can these developments be understood? RQ 3 Which developments in residential broadband usage patterns can be recognized between 2001 and 2005, with regard to Information, Communication, Entertainment and Transaction functions and how can these developments be understood? RQ 4 Which developments in residential broadband usage patterns can be recognized between 2001 and 2005, with regard to health, safety and <b>telework</b> <b>services</b> and how can these developments be understood? The user perspective More and more the notion {{of the importance of the}} user is recognized by governments and other parties involved in the roll out of broadband. From a theoretical point of view the role of user of innovations is also considered important. In literature addressing the concept of diffusion, the adoption of technological innovations is seen as dependent on one’s innovativeness, or willingness to try new products (Rogers, 1995; Atkin, et al., 1998; Neuendorf, et al., 1998). These remarks make clear that the individuals that are to adopt (or reject) the innovation play a crucial role in the diffusion process. It is therefore important to study the adoption and diffusion process from a user perspective. Relevance The insights gained by this research can serve as guidelines for both policymakers and businesses. This relevance becomes also apparent when considering the parties that were involved in and co-financed this project, initiated by Dialogic innovation and interaction: The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, the cities of Almere and Amsterdam, KPN (Dutch Telecom company), Vecai (the association for cable companies) and Ex’ovision (developer of video services). Methodology The data are collected in a longitudinal and multi-method survey. There have been three measurements in 2001, 2003 and 2005. – Online surveys (N= 1072, 2325, 1102) – Diary research (N= 17, 36, 26) – Focus groups (N= 34, 25, 16) – An additional survey to investigate the way internet is used to search for health information (N= 123) ...|$|R
40|$|The World Wide Web {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{interfaces}} to the Internet and thus to the global office as it provides an easy-to-use and self-explaining user interface for teleworkers. However WWW based interfaces are relatively rigid and are lacking ways of user customization or setting preferences. The new service oriented approach presented here builds upon the strength of the WWW interface to Internet services but enhances it by the power of individual customization. The Personalized Home Page (PHP) system is built on a framework capable to describe all Internet services in a uniform way using the terminology of weak agency. This paper gives an overview of the PHP system with a short description of the agent based framework behind. Examples introduce the actual use of the system.
