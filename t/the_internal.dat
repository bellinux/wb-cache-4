5|$|A general {{application}} of matrices in physics {{is to the}} description of linearly coupled harmonic systems. The equations of motion of such systems {{can be described in}} matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions is to determine the system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques like this are crucial when it comes to <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> dynamics of molecules: <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are also needed for describing mechanical vibrations, and oscillations in electrical circuits.|$|E

40|$|Bubble column reactors, with {{or without}} solid particles, {{have a number of}} {{applications}} in the chemical, petrochemical, biochemical and environmental industries. A number of these industrial applications require internals such as baffles, heat transfer surfaces and special distributors to meet demands. Proper selection and design of these internals can lead to the improved performance and efficiency of a bubble column reactor. Several experiments are carried out in a bubble column equipped with a concentric tube bundle (CT) and an internal combination consisting of a concentric tube bundle and concentric baffle (or static mixer) (CTB) respectively. Neutrally buoyant particles are used to determine the effect of the CT and CTB <b>internals</b> on <b>the</b> local flow structures in the equipped column respectively. More upward, near-linear particle movements are observed with <b>the</b> CTB <b>internal</b> over <b>the</b> CT <b>internal.</b> Several non-linear particle movements are also observed. Overall bulk liquid circulation flow patterns are proposed for the intermediate to high gas velocity range based on the observed local flow structures for both internals. Comparisons are made between the gas holdups obtained during internal equipment and that of a comparable hollow bubble column from <b>the</b> literature. Both <b>internals</b> increase <b>the</b> gas holdup of a hollow bubble column. However, the increases with <b>the</b> CT <b>internal</b> are higher by more than 25 % of that obtained with <b>the</b> CTB <b>internal</b> on average. <b>The</b> effect of <b>the</b> <b>internals</b> on average bubble size is investigated for the small bubble class. Smaller average diameters are obtained when <b>the</b> CT <b>internal</b> is used. <b>The</b> interfacial area in the presence of <b>the</b> two <b>internals</b> is determined respectively. Higher interfacial areas are obtained with <b>the</b> CT <b>internal.</b> <b>The</b> average difference in interfacial area is 54. 0 m 2 /m 3. The effect of <b>the</b> <b>internals</b> on mixing time is determined through dye and aqueous salt tracer studies. In both instances, higher mixing times are obtained with <b>the</b> CTB <b>internal.</b> Liquid backmixing is quantified through the axial dispersion coefficients obtained from the salt tracer studies. The axial dispersion coefficients obtained with <b>the</b> CT <b>internal</b> are higher than that of <b>the</b> CTB <b>internal</b> by about 15 % on average...|$|R

5|$|Heating in Enceladus has {{occurred}} through various mechanisms ever since its formation. Radioactive decay in its core may have initially heated it, {{giving it a}} warm core and a subsurface ocean, which is now kept above freezing through an unidentified mechanism. Geophysical models indicate that tidal heating is a main heat source, perhaps aided by radioactive decay and some heat-producing chemical reactions. A 2007 study predicted <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> heat of Enceladus, if generated by tidal forces, could be no greater than 1.1 gigawatts, but data from Cassini's infrared spectrometer of the south polar terrain over 16 months, indicate that <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> heat generated power is about 4.7 gigawatts, and {{suggest that it is}} in thermal equilibrium.|$|E
