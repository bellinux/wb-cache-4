He travels across the United States and pits two bar owners {{against each other}} {{to see who can}} turn the most profit. But the twist is they have to run each other's bars for a night. How the show works is Mandel {{introduces}} each bar owner. Each owner then gets to <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> what their bar offers and how they run things. Then the owners travel to each other's bars to spend a week there and meet the staff. In repeated interviews, the owners talk about how they feel about how the other bar is run and what types of changes they would make if they were the owner. Later on during the week, the owners [...] "take over" [...] the establishment and implement their rules and TV viewers observe how the staff reacts to these changes. Many times, there is friction between the staff and the owners at this stage in the competition. One major stipulation of the show is that the new owner cannot fire any staff members for breaking any of the new rules, but can discipline them in other ways. Finally, there is the [...] "relaunch" [...] night where the owner has complete control of the bar. This is the night that counts towards the profit totals which will determine who wins the competition. The winner receives a $10,000 grand prize.|$|E

Participants recruited from the projects were given single-use film cameras and trained in a twelve-week lecture/workshop course in photography. In between sessions, the participants would put into practice the lesson learned at the previous class.

[...] According to the book, cameras were donated by Kodak and computers by Dell Computers, while film was processed at cost by Duggal Visual Solutions.

Let me start with what is my main take-away from Markus ’ and Yuliy’s exciting research agenda: heterogeneity is paramount in macroeconomic models. When faced with large aggregate shocks, representative agent based macroeconomic models are insufficient. As Markus and Yuliy put it, “any model that studies financial instability and the role of financial frictions must depart from the representative agent analysis. ” This important point has been developed in a series of their studies (Brunnermeier and Sannikov 2012 a, 2012 b, 2012 c) ...|$|E

Based on a resulted transformation relation between arbitrary angle dependence of bottom scattering and the range dependence of reverberation in shallow water, some experimental data on bottom scattering at small grazing angles and low frequencies will be given in the third part.

30|$|In the {{teaching}} of The Tao (Way) and its Te (Virtue), there are two key concepts: Tao and Te. I discussed the Tao previously and now I’d like to <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> Te. Te, usually translated as “Virtue”, is conformity to principles. Te is, in a sense, manifestation of the Tao, the revelation of {{the true nature of}} the Tao. Occasionally Te is employed to signify the quality of natural goodness, which is the result of enlightenment and of the manifestation and function of the Tao in man and all that exists in the universe. The word “Te” in Taoist literature indicates power or strength. It means that all things contain an inherent power or strength that comes from their own essential being or true inner nature. This power derives from the fact that our true self is an expression of the Tao, because it is intrinsically connected with the power of the universe. However, the idea of Virtue (Te) is that of power exercised without the use of force and without inappropriate interference in the existing order of things. Virtue is an inward quality and state. To do right is to obey the laws of nature, of virtue, and to live in conformity and harmony with them. Failure to do so brings automatic and equally natural retribution, disharmony, disruption, and consequent misery.|$|E

I think that’s very important because I think there is a tendency in a new field when there is a lot of excitement to over-promise. For example, artificial intelligence that led to the famous AI winter, when people said that a strong artificial intelligence was just around the corner.

I stand before you as a married man. I have been married for sixteen years and change. Marriage is a sacred {{institution}} for me as a Christian and a vitally important institution for the construction of society. Every society we know of either has had marriage in some form or has left us ambiguous evidence. There are some ancient societies about which we are not sure. But what anthropologists tell us today {{is that there is no}} society of which it can confidently be said, 2 ̆ 2 These folks did not, in fact, get married. 2 ̆ 2 Marriage seems to be natural to the human species.

One of the great virtues of a conference like this one is precisely, I think, the desire to celebrate marriage itself and take from that celebration lessons for other issues that may divide us. The issue of same-sex marriage is, of course, a tremendously divisive one in the nation and among scholars. Probably today 2 ̆ 7 s conference would have been more fruitful if there had been more people here who have a firm position in favor of it, as a way of generating some interesting conversation.

First, we give a roughly ee− 1 -competitive randomized algorithm for ski-rental problem in Section 1. Then we show an O(logm · log n) -competitive randomized algorithm for online set cover problem in Section 2. In the end, we <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> approximation problems, and start to analyze the greedy algorithm for offline set cover problem in Section 3. 1 Ski-rental Problem Recap the ski-rental problem: we want to ski for indefinite days, and for each day we need to choose whether to rent ski or to buy ski. We know • cost of renting: $ 1 • cost of buying: $B Our goal is to minimize total cost. Last time we saw that deterministically {{we could get a}} 2 -competitive online algorithm. In this section, we show a randomized algorithm with competitive ratio 1 + 1 (1 + 1 /B) B− 1, which is roughly e e− 1 because as B gets large, (1 + 1 /B) B ≈ e, and the ratio goes down to ee− 1. Note that the worst case is 2 when B = 1, but B should be more than 1 because otherwise we will not rent skis at all. This bound is originally given by Karlin et al. [KMMO 94]. But we will not show the algorithm as they did, instead we adopt a primal-dual approach to get this bound. (See Chapter 3 in [BN 09], which gives this algorithm as an example.) In the online version of primal LP, we see one constraint at a time. We have to make online decision to change the variables in order to satisfy the constraint. And through the time the variables should increase monotonously. zi indicates whether to rent on the i-th day, and x indicates whether we buy ski. There are k days in total.

At this article, I tried to make a metaphysical approach of what is for something to be fundamental, and I also tried to <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of fundamental incomplete and complete theories. To do that, I start stating the notion of “entity” and looking at the difference at perceived entities. The difference led us to talk about the entities’ structures and their powers, and about the supervenience between these last two. The supervenience talk made us to see the fight between emergentism and reductionism as the difference between the irreducibility of laws and the reducibility of powers and structures to lower-order domains. Then, we conclude that “fundamentality” is a mereological relation – a relation that a whole structure has to a certain combination of its structural parts or that a power has to a certain combination of its constituent powers – of to be identical and to exist in virtue of them...|$|R

We'll mention some important statistical tools operating as an irreplaceable component of the GARCH(1, 1) model, which will be introduce in the section 2. We'll scrutinize its specific properties, advantages, constraints and indeed the statistical inference. Because it's considered as a flexible model with rather general structure we'll also discuss some complications which can occur during its applications and convenient ways to solve them. Implementation of the model will be presented in the section 3. We'll use real market data and show clear demonstration of the scrutinized properties. At the end we'll verify how the model is significant when explaining the volatility of an asset...|$|R
5000|$|During initial interrigations {{without a}} lawyer, the police used suggestive {{question}} techniques to introduce Andersen {{to the idea}} that Viggo Kristiansen was a participant and even the leading force of the crime. The interrogater wrote the following in the police rapport: [...] "I explained for Andersen that the police now knew {{he was one of the}} perpetrators. I also told Andersen about the advantages he would get by explaining everything", and furthermore: [...] "I asked Andersen if he himself could be a victim in some sense since his best buddy Viggo Kristiansen could have been the most active participant. When I said this, it was obvious that Andersen got something to think about. We <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> back and forth about the relationship between Andersen and Kristiansen, and there was no doubt that Kristiansen was the strong one, the one in charge". Gregg McCrary from the FBI testified in court in 2011 and said the following about this interrogation: [...] "It's a very alarming way to interrogate a witness. The police must never give the name of possible perpetrators or ask leading questions". McCrary also said that it seemed obvious that Andersen had been guided since the details changed from interrogation to interrogation.|$|R
