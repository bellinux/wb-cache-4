5|$|Stabilizing {{the person}} is the first priority. Those with a {{depressed}} level of consciousness {{may need to be}} intubated and mechanically ventilated. Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale are monitored frequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, admission to an intensive care unit may be preferable, especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission. Nutrition is an early priority, with by mouth or nasogastric <b>tube</b> <b>feeding</b> being preferable over parenteral routes. In general, pain control is restricted to less-sedating agents such as codeine, as sedation may impact on the mental status and thus interfere with the ability to monitor the level of consciousness. Deep vein thrombosis is prevented with compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression of the calves, or both. A bladder catheter is usually inserted to monitor fluid balance. Benzodiazepines may be administered to help relieve distress. Antiemetic drugs should be given to awake persons.|$|E
25|$|Children who {{are born}} preterm have {{difficulty}} in initiating breast feeds immediately after birth. By convention, such children are often fed on expressed breast milk or other supplementary feeds through tubes or bottles until they develop satisfactory ability to suck breast milk. <b>Tube</b> <b>feeding,</b> though commonly used, is {{not supported by}} scientific evidence as of October 2016. It has also {{been reported in the}} same systematic review that by avoiding bottles and using cups instead to provide supplementary feeds to preterm children, a greater extent of breast feeding for a longer duration can subsequently be achieved.|$|E
25|$|Many {{patients}} {{will be in}} pain and have a loss of appetite after surgery. Part of the body's response to surgery is to direct energy to wound healing, which increases the body's overall energy requirements. Surgery affects nutritional status indirectly, particularly during the recovery period, as it can interfere with wound healing {{and other aspects of}} recovery. Surgery directly affects nutritional status if a procedure permanently alters the digestive system. Enteral nutrition (<b>tube</b> <b>feeding)</b> is often needed. However a policy of 'nil by mouth' for all gastrointestinal surgery has not been shown to benefit, with some suggestion it might hinder recovery.|$|E

40|$|Small-bore {{flexible}} <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> {{decrease the}} risk of ulceration of the nose, pharynx, and stomach compared with large-bore and more rigid <b>tubes.</b> However, small-bore <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> have more respiratory system complications, such as pneumothorax, hydropneumothorax, bronchopleural fistula, and pneumonia, which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Thus, {{it is important to}} confirm the correct position of <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes.</b> Chest X-ray is the gold standard to detect tracheal malpositioning of the <b>feeding</b> <b>tube.</b> We present three cases in which intubated patients exhibited an altered mental state.

25|$|Treatment of {{anorexia}} involves restoring {{a healthy}} weight, treating the underlying psychological problems, and addressing behaviors that promote the problem. While medications do not help with weight gain, {{they may be}} used to help with associated anxiety or depression. A number of types of therapy may be useful including an approach where parents assume responsibility for feeding their child, known as Maudsley family therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. Sometimes people require admission to hospital to restore weight. Evidence for benefit from nasogastric <b>tube</b> <b>feeding,</b> however, is unclear. Some people will just have a single episode and recover while others may have many episodes over years. Many complications improve or resolve with regaining of weight.|$|E
25|$|As {{with mild}} acute pancreatitis, {{it will be}} {{necessary}} to treat the underlying cause—gallstones, discontinuing medications, cessation of alcohol, etc. If the cause is gallstones, it is likely that an ERCP procedure or removal of the gallbladder will be recommended. The gallbladder should be removed during the same hospital admission or within two weeks of pancreatitis onset so as to limit the risk of recurrent pancreatitis. If the cause of pancreatitis is alcohol, cessation of alcohol consumption and treatment for alcohol dependency may improve pancreatitis. Even if the underlying cause is not related to alcohol consumption, doctors recommend avoiding it for at least six months as this can cause further damage to the pancreas during the recovery process. Oral intake, especially fats, is generally restricted initially but early enteral feeding within 48 hours has been shown to improve clinical outcomes. Fluids and electrolytes are replaced intravenously. Nutritional support is initiated via <b>tube</b> <b>feeding</b> to surpass the portion of the digestive tract most affected by secreted pancreatic enzymes if there is no improvement in the first 72–96 hours of treatment.|$|E
25|$|As to the {{toxicity}} of philodendrons in cats, {{the evidence is}} conflicting. In one study, 72 cases of cat poisonings were examined, of which 37 resulted {{in the death of}} the cat. The symptoms of the poisoned cats included excitability, spasms, seizures, renal failure, and encephalitis. However, in another study, three cats were tube fed Philodendron cordatum and showed no signs of acute poisoning. In this study, two adult cats and one kitten were fed a puréed leaf and water mixture, observed afterward, then euthanized, and finally a necropsy was performed. Dosages of 2.8, 5.6, and 9.1 g/kg were used, with the highest dose administered being considerably more than any house cat could consume. The cats showed none of the symptoms found in past epidemiological studies and appeared normal. Necropsies showed nothing that would suggest toxicity. The past epidemiological studies have been suggested to be wrong, since sick cats may be inclined to eat plants to alleviate their illnesses. If this were the case, then such studies would be incorrectly attributing the sickness of the cats to the philodendrons. The forced feeding study may have failed to show signs of philodendron toxicity because the <b>tube</b> <b>feeding</b> bypassed the mouth and hence minimized the typical signs of irritation.|$|E
40|$|Frequently, narrow-bore <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> {{are placed}} in {{critically}} ill hospitalized patients without difficulty.

40|$|Plant {{parasitic}} nematodes comprise several groups; {{the most}} economically damaging {{of these are}} the sedentary endoparasites. Sedentary endoparasitic nematodes modify host root tissues, using a suite of effector proteins to create and maintain a feeding site that is their sole source of nutrition. Ultrastructural studies of plant-nematode interactions, and in particular those of the feeding sites, have identified two key <b>feeding</b> structures; <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> and <b>feeding</b> plugs. Sedentary plant-parasitic nematodes feed by withdrawing host cell assimilate from the feeding site though a <b>feeding</b> <b>tube.</b> The function, composition and molecular characteristics of both <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> and <b>feeding</b> plugs are poorly characterised. It is hypothesised that the apparent selective uptake of certain proteins from the feeding site is attributed to <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> size exclusion.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{widely held}} {{assumption}} is that postpyloric intubations occur more often with weighted than with un-weighted nasally inserted <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes.</b> This randomized, pro-spective study compared the frequency of duodenal intubations using weighted and unweighted nasoenteric <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes.</b> One hundred sixteen patients had either weighted (61 patients) or unweighted (55 patients) 10 F silicone elastomer <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> inserted nasally 85 cm. Tubes were placed with wire stylets. Tube positions were verified radiographically within 4 hr after insertions. Radiographs were repeated daily for 3 days or until duodenal intubation occurred. Successful duodenal intubations were achieved in 35 patients (57 %) with weighted <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> and in 37 patients (67 %) with unweighted <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes.</b> This difference was not significant.

500|$|The breed is {{predisposed}} to conditions {{found in many}} breeds, such as abdominal hernias. Westie puppies may be affected by craniomandibular osteopathy, a disease also known as [...] "lion jaw", and is sometimes {{also referred to as}} [...] "westie jaw". The disease is an autosomal recessive condition, so a puppy can only be affected by it if both its parents are carriers of the faulty gene. The condition appears across many breeds, including several different types of terriers, as well as other unrelated breeds such as the Great Dane. It typically appears in dogs under a year old, and can cause problems for the dog to chew or swallow food. Radiographic testing can be conducted to diagnose the condition, in which the bones around the jaw thicken; additionally, the blood may show increased calcium levels and enzyme levels. The condition often stops progressing by the time the dog is a year old, and in some cases can recede. It is normally treated with anti-inflammatory medications, and the feeding of soft foods. In some cases, <b>tube</b> <b>feeding</b> may be necessary. However, if the animal still cannot eat and is in uncontrolled pain, then euthanasia may be the only medical option remaining.|$|E

2500|$|Esomeprazole capsules, {{as well as}} Losec/Prilosec tablets, are {{formulated}} as a [...] "multiple-unit pellet system" [...] (MUPS). Essentially, {{the capsule}} consists of extremely small enteric-coated granules (pellets) of the esomeprazole formulation inside an outer shell. When the capsule is immersed in an aqueous solution, as happens when the capsule reaches the stomach, water enters the capsule by osmosis. The contents swell from water absorption, causing the shell to burst, and releasing the enteric-coated granules. For most patients, the multiple-unit pellet system is of no advantage over conventional enteric-coated preparations. Patients for whom the formulation is of benefit include those requiring nasogastric <b>tube</b> <b>feeding</b> and those with difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Accurate tube {{placement}} of orogastric and nasogastric <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> in neonates {{is important to}} ensure safe and effective enteral feeding.

[...] Another delegate who toured the farms stated that the birds appeared to be well cared for and better off than other poultry raised in factory farming. [...] The overall position of the House of Delegates was that [...] "observations and practical experience shared by HOD members indicate a minimum of adverse effects on the birds involved." [...] The closing comments in the HOD were that the AVMA should be taking positions on facts and science, make broad policy positions on general animal welfare, and support positions that created oversight of controversial practices for fear that prohibition would cause production to move to countries without animal welfare regulation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> {{placement}} can {{be achieved}} by fluoroscopic or endoscopic techniques. Significant complications due to nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> placement, such as hydrothorax, duodenal perforation and retroperitoneal emphysema, are very rare. We present a case of massive retroperitoneal emphysema and abscess because of duodenal perforation caused by a kink in a nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube.</b> Case presentation A 34 -year-old Chinese woman was admitted to our intensive care unit due to hypertriglyceridemia and severe acute pancreatitis. As she suffered from acute respiratory distress syndrome and required mechanical ventilation, a nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> was placed by transnasal endoscopic technique. The procedure took place at her bedside. Half a month later, she had a high fever and abdominal distension. An abdominal radiography was performed and showed that the nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> was kinking on the third portion of the duodenum and the tip of the nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> was inserted into the right retroperitoneum on the second portion of the duodenum. Conclusion When a nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> is placed through the transnasal endoscopic technique, an abdominal radiography should be used to confirm the tube's position and indicate if it is kinking or beyond the ligament of Treitz. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Enteral feeding {{should be}} {{considered}} for patients with an intact and functional gastrointestinal tract. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement is indicated in patients requiring medium to long term enteral feeding (> 30 days) and with impaired swallowing.
