The first model to be developed was actually the SC-3000, a computer version with a built-in keyboard, but when Sega learned of Nintendo's plans to release a games-only console, they began developing the SG-1000 alongside the SC-3000.|$|E

50|$|Although {{manufacturers}} {{are responsible for}} establishing recycling infrastructure for home appliances, the specific method is not regulated. Therefore, the responses {{can be divided into}} two vague groups: Group A and Group B. The two different methods help to enable competition and create new recycling processes by providing about 200 national collection sites with dissimilar viewpoints on reducing costs. In the broadest terms, Group A aims <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>cost</b> <b>down</b> through maximum utilization of existing waste management companies, while Group B attempts to cut costs by adopting efficient logistics systems.|$|R
50|$|Reliant's first Scimitar was a coupé {{based upon}} the styling of a Daimler SP250 {{prototype}} (renamed the SX250) and the chassis of a Reliant Sabre. It was first displayed in 1964. It was powered by a 2.6-litre Ford straight six from the Ford Zephyr and Zodiac. In order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>cost</b> <b>down,</b> many components {{in addition to the}} engine were existing ones originally designed for competitor models, a point emphasized for buyers of the early Scimitars in which unfolding the sun visor involved knocking the driver's mirror out of adjustment.|$|R

However, Wei Te Chemical Co., a manufacturer of clouding agents, claims that [...] "the reason most businesses tended to utilize illegal clouding agents was not because of price, but rather the long preservation periods and esthetically pleasing effect of using DEHP-laced products." ...|$|R

He was not successful, though he did manage to purchase 50,000 tons of steel rails at a bargain price. Tupper's old friend Sandford Fleming oversaw the railway construction, but his inability <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>costs</b> <b>down</b> led to political controversy, and Tupper was forced to remove Fleming as Chief Engineer in May 1880.|$|E

25|$|Led by Masayuki Uemura, Nintendo's R {{team had}} been {{secretly}} {{working on a}} system since 1980, ambitiously targeted to be less expensive than its competitors, yet with performance {{that could not be}} surpassed by its competitors for at least a year. Uemura initially thought of using a modern 16-bit CPU, but instead settled on the inexpensive MOS Technology 6502, supplementing it with a custom graphics chip (the Picture Processing Unit). <b>To</b> <b>keep</b> <b>costs</b> <b>down,</b> suggestions of including a keyboard, modem, and floppy disk drive were rejected, but expensive circuitry was added to provide a versatile 15-pin expansion port connection {{on the front of the}} console for future add-on functionality such as peripheral devices.|$|E

25|$|The band {{decided to}} record its next album {{without the help}} of a label, {{supporting}} itself with touring and by compiling its previously released singles into Singles, which was released on indie label Big Wheel Recreation. The band also took on day jobs, saving {{as much as they could}} to spend on the sessions. The band worked for a third time with Trombino, who agreed to defer payment until after the album's release in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>costs</b> <b>down.</b> Some of the drum tracks were recorded at Cherokee, and then the band moved to Doug Messenger's harddrive analog and digital in North Hollywood, where five weeks of tracking completed the recording phase. Trombino then mixed the record at Extasy in Hollywood.|$|E
25|$|With {{the growth}} of the size of {{development}} teams in the industry, the problem of cost has increased. Development studios {{need to be able to}} pay their staff a competitive wage in order to attract and retain the best talent, while publishers are constantly looking <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>costs</b> <b>down</b> in order to maintain profitability on their investment. Typically, a video game console development team can range in sizes of anywhere from 5 to 50 people, with some teams exceeding 100. In May 2009, one game project was reported to have a development staff of 450. The growth of team size combined with greater pressure to get completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines, rushed games and the release of unfinished products.|$|E
25|$|Both Braathens SAFE and SAS {{had been}} cross-subsidizing their routes {{as part of}} the {{concession}} agreements, and Braathens SAFE was losing money on the Haugesund–Bergen route and flights to Røros. A three-year wage agreement was reached with the trade unions <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>costs</b> <b>down,</b> and the company raised additional capital in an initial public offering and subsequent listing on the Oslo Stock Exchange on 10 January 1994. After the listing, Braganza retained 69% of the company. On 1 April, service frequencies increased on the Oslo–Bergen route and the airline introduced direct flights from Oslo to Tromsø and Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes, later supplemented with direct services to Bodø. The following two years, Braathens SAFE also introduced scheduled international flights to Rome, as well as summer routes to Jersey and Nice. However, Braathens SAFE terminated their routes from Bergen to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø, making the passengers switch planes in Trondheim. Braathens signed agreements with many of Norway's large companies in 1995 in exchange for large discounts.|$|E

500|$|Initially, {{the film}} was {{rejected}} by every major studio in Hollywood, mostly due to the $20 million budget and the deal Lucas was offering. Eventually Paramount agreed to finance the film, with Lucas negotiating a five-picture deal. By April 1980, Kasdan's fifth draft was produced, and production {{was getting ready to}} shoot at Elstree Studios, with Lucas trying <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>costs</b> <b>down.</b> With four illustrators, Raiders of the Lost Ark was Spielberg's most storyboarded film of his career to date, further helping the film economically. He and Lucas agreed on a tight schedule <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>costs</b> <b>down</b> and to follow the [...] "quick and dirty" [...] feel of the old Saturday matinée serials. Special effects were done using puppets, miniature models, animation, and camera trickery. [...] "We didn't do 30 or 40 takes; usually only four. It was like silent film--shoot only what you need, no waste", Spielberg said. [...] "Had I had more time and money, it would have turned out a pretentious movie." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a cheaper}} option the UX32A was praised by Chris Martin of PC Advisor for being [...] "a more {{affordable}} luxury", retaining the [...] "premium feel" [...] of the Zenbook range {{but at a}} lower price point. The aluminium chassis, which is identical to the UX32VD <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>costs</b> <b>down,</b> was widely acclaimed for its strength and build quality. By contrast, the Sandy Bridge chip, a previous-generation part at the time of sale, was outlined as a detraction as was the lower battery life compared to the UX31E. Although the screen used was a TN panel and of a lower resolution than the UX32VD or UX31A, it was considered an acceptable compromise for the price. The screen has a matte finish and relatively high brightness which Notebook Check's reviewer, Christian Hepp, found [...] "quite suitable for outdoor use", noting that it had a good contrast ratio but a narrow range of colours.|$|E
500|$|Prince Caspian, a British-American production, is {{the last}} Narnia film to be co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures, as 20th Century Fox became the {{distributor}} for the next film [...] Work on the script began before The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was released, so filming could begin before the actors grew too old for their parts. Director Andrew Adamson {{wanted to make the}} film more spectacular than the first, and created an action sequence not in the novel. The Narnians were designed to look wilder as they have been hiding from persecution, stressing the darker tone of the sequel. The filmmakers also took a Spanish influence for the antagonistic race of the Telmarines. Filming began in February 2007 in New Zealand, but unlike the previous film, the majority of shooting took place in Central Europe, because of the larger sets available in those countries. <b>To</b> <b>keep</b> <b>costs</b> <b>down,</b> Adamson chose to base post-production in the UK, because of recent tax credits there.|$|E
