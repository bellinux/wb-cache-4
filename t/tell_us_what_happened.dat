Will a new cancer drug be worth its side effects? Is this strain of ‘flu {{going to be a}} dangerous epidemic? Uncertainty is normal currency in scientific research. Research goes on because we don’t know everything.

5000|$|Huntingtower {{is said to}} be {{haunted by}} [...] "Lady Greensleeves", a young woman named Dorothea who was the {{daughter}} of the 1st Earl of Gowrie. The legend states that {{she was in love with}} a servant at the castle and that the two used to have clandestine meetings at night in the eastern tower, where the servants slept. One night the girl's mother, the Countess, is supposed to have discovered what was going on and made her way across the bridge from the family's quarters in the western tower to the eastern tower to catch the pair. Dorothea heard her mother's footsteps on the bridge and, unable to return to the other tower by that route, made her way to the roof. Here she leapt from the tower to land safely on the battlements of the western tower and so return to bed where she was discovered by her mother. The distance between the towers was several metres and thus she accomplished quite a feat in leaping the distance. The following day the girl and her lover eloped and no records exist to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to them.|$|E
5000|$|In The Last Battle, Susan is {{conspicuous}} by her absence. Peter {{says that}} she is [...] "no longer a friend of Narnia", and (in Jill Pole's words) [...] "she's interested in nothing now-a-days except nylons and lipstick and invitations." [...] Similarly, Eustace Scrubb quotes her as saying, [...] "What wonderful memories you have! Fancy you still thinking about all those funny games {{we used to play}} when we were children," [...] and Polly Plummer adds, [...] "She wasted all her school time wanting to be the age she is now, and she'll waste all {{the rest of her life}} trying to stay that age. Her whole idea is to race on to the silliest time of one's life as quick as she can and then stop there as long as she can." [...] Thus, Susan does not enter the real Narnia with the others at the end of the series. It is left ambiguous whether Susan's absence is permanent, especially since Lewis stated elsewhere that: The books don't <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to Susan. She is left alive in this world at the end, having by then turned into a rather silly, conceited young woman. But there's plenty of time for her to mend and perhaps she will get to Aslan's country in the end... in her own way.|$|E

Here, we hope to use “Augmented Service Offering ” (1.) to describe what services they offer, and (2.) to explore how these services work and augment their basic service package. Besides, we offer an observation way to help us describe their service. Tesco is a world-class food retailer. They grow rapidly, in 2000, Tesco opened its first hypermarket in Taiwan, and planned {{that there will be}} 22 stores in Taiwan. They are very famous in UK. So, we chose Tesco in Taichung as our research sample to see their service. The result reveals they should improve somewhere. If it is enough in Asia, they don’t do it. But, that is another research question. So, we still give them some suggestion...|$|R
5000|$|Last summer some people, tourists, were at Wounded Knee while I {{was there}} visiting my son's grave. They asked me where Wounded Knee was. [...] "Right here," [...] I said, [...] "This {{is the church}} that burned down. The goons burned it down because there's a lot of {{evidence}} in that church. It's full of holes. It's just like a honeycomb in there. The people were in there so they shot at them. So this is it," [...] I said. [...] "And down the hill you can see that house over there. It's burnt down, and that church over there, that's where the people stayed. And this, all of this hill around here was where they surrendered, a handful of people." ...I thought it over, about the first massacre in 1890. My mother was twelve years old and she was right in there. She used to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> She said they surrendered to the Government like that, and they took all their weapons, whatever they had. When they got through then they started shooting them, little babies on up, women, men. ...I never had given it a thought that someday this would happen here again and my son was going to be next, lying in the Wounded Knee Cemetery. Before this happened he liked to joke. They were sitting around and he said, [...] "If anything happens to me," [...] he said, [...] "bury me here in Wounded Knee." [...] And he laughed. Later on he said, [...] "Things are getting tough, I see, so if I get killed, I don't want to bother my people so just bury me in the bunker. That's where I want to be, fighting for my people. I don't want to go out of here, out of Wounded Knee. I want to be buried right here."So that's where we buried him. My mother's uncle and aunt are buried there from the 1890 massacre.I told the tourists, I said, that I never thought that my son would be next, that he would be lying here. ... Agnes Lamonte ...|$|E
50|$|The film {{starts at}} an anniversary {{commemoration}} of the crash, where roses are dropped on the track to {{the aftermath of the}} wreck where first responders are arriving at the scene. Five months later the coroner, Tom Weir, brings in Boris Osman, an engineer to help him investigate the crash and immediately runs into stonewalling by the state-owned rail company, who don’t want him to examine the train. Osman thinks it’s because the investigation will have to disclose why the tracks that caused the wreck were in such bad shape. Osman thinks it was caused by the politicians in office allowing the rail system to deteriorate. The coroner learns the bridge was hit twice before. Pressure begins to be brought on the coroner from above to stop asking to look at the train. Osman learns this is the third time this locomotive went off the rails. The coroner uses the threat of contempt of court to force the rail company to let Osman examine the locomotive. The inquest begins, with Orman recounting how the tragedy happened on 18 January 1977, alternating with the stories of some passengers who traveled on the ill-fated train, leading up to the depiction of the accident. Due to worn out track and worn out wheels on the locomotive, it jumps the rails and hits a bridge support, causing it to collapse on the train. The community springs into action to aid the survivors and recover the 83 dead. Several of the rescuers testify at the inquest and recount their actions {{on the day of the}} accident. Many rescuers risk their own lives to save the injured. Even when ordered to leave due to the danger of further collapse, many refuse to abandon injured survivors. Many of the rescuers are traumatized by what they saw. Ormond comes under attack for saying that it was the condition of the locomotive’s wheels that contributed to the accident, since while money has been allocated to repair the tracks, there is no money to also repair the locomotives. The families of the dead try to cope, while Gerry Buchtman, who went to Granville while on sick leave from his emergency responder job has to fight to keep his job, since the powers that be want to fire him for doing just that. In spite of pressure, the coroner finds that the locomotive’s condition contributed to the accident. Osman later learns that even though the rail company knew this type of locomotive was dangerous due to a derailment 11 months before Granville, they took no steps to lower the speed on this line because it came from an electoral district that often decided national elections and the government did not want to anger the voters by making their train late. We return to the memorial service, while on screen captions <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to some of the people involved in the crash and the investigation.|$|E

Suetonius conducted punitive operations, but criticism by Classicianus led to an investigation headed by Nero's freedman Polyclitus. Fearing Suetonius's actions would provoke further rebellion, Nero replaced the governor with the more conciliatory Publius Petronius Turpilianus.

It involves the prediction that [...] "If it is raining, I will get wet out there unless I have my umbrella". In that sense, {{even though it is}} already raining outside, the decision to take an umbrella is not a purely reactive thing. It involves the use of predictive models which <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> will <b>happen</b> if we don't take the umbrella, when it is already raining outside.|$|R
