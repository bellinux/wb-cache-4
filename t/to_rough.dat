5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> surf {{from the}} {{precursor}} low, local National Weather Service offices issued a High Surf Advisory {{for much of}} the coastline from Florida through North Carolina. Upon first becoming a subtropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch {{from the mouth of the}} Altamaha River in Georgia southward to Flagler Beach, Florida. The watch was discontinued after Andrea weakened to a subtropical depression. Additionally, a gale warning was issued {{for much of the}} South Carolina coastline.|$|E

5|$|In northeastern Honduras, low-lying {{areas were}} {{evacuated}} and numerous homes were destroyed. Rainfall peaked at 7.9in (200mm), resulting in widespread flooding. Waves up to 7ft (2.1m) affected the coastline. An American tourist drowned off Cozumel after succumbing <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> seas. Only very minor impacts were observed along the northeastern coastline of the Yucatán Peninsula. The outer bands of Paula affected Cuba, where rainfall peaked at 7.32in (186mm) and winds reached 68mph (109km/h). The strong winds downed many trees, blocking roadways, and damaged {{the roofs of}} several homes. The rain, however, was regarded as generally beneficial to crops and low reservoirs. Rough seas removed concrete from Havana's sea wall and submerged coastal streets under 1–2ft (0.3–0.61m) of water.|$|E
5|$|On July20, the Government of Mexico {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch {{for a portion of}} the southwestern Mexico coast from Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco; this watch remained posted until the early hours of July21. Several hours later, another tropical storm watch was issued for coastal areas of the Baja California Peninsula from Agua Blanca to Buenavista, and was later upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} warning as Dora neared the coast. However, the warning was lifted after the hurricane weakened and moved away from land. In Guerrero, the threat of flooding prompted the state government to prepare 900shelters, while boaters were ordered to exercise caution due <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> seas generated by the nearby tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Quickly {{accelerating}} northwards, Helene made landfall on Newfoundland late on September29. Rainfall {{peaked at}} 3.05in (77.5mm) in northern {{parts of the}} island, while rainfall amounts were generally minimal across the Avalon Peninsula. A weather station in Naval Station Argentia reported maximum sustained winds of 60mph (100km/h) and a gust of 82mph (132km/h). The winds severed communications in southwestern Newfoundland and cut communications in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador from the mainland. Bell Island was {{cut off from the}} rest of Newfoundland due <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> seas generated by Helene, which resulted in the destruction of piers and lack of boat service. Damage caused by the hurricane on the island were estimated to be in excess of C$100,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{pressure}} gradient between Carrie {{and the high}} pressure area to its north produced gusty northeasterly winds, and by extension high seas. In response, the National Weather Service issued small craft warnings starting on September 1 and extending from Massachusetts to the Carolinas. Gale warnings were posted the next day from southern New Jersey to the coast of central New England, and the small craft warnings were brought north to Maine. Ongoing, {{as well as the}} threat of continued heavy rainfall necessitated the issuance of flash flood watches throughout eastern Massachusetts, southeastern New Hampshire, and southern and central Maine on September 3. Due <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> surf, the beach at Virginia Beach, Virginia was closed to swimmers on August 31.|$|E

5|$|Thousands {{of people}} {{evacuated}} from northern {{areas of the}} Philippines as Ivan approached. Power was shut off prior to the storm {{to reduce the risk}} of electrocution. Four flights were cancelled in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines due to the storm. Residents in Taiwan were advised to take precautions for Typhoon Ivan, though autumn typhoons are rare in the island. Vessels were urged to stay at port due <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> seas throughout the Philippines. Disaster agencies were put on high alert; relief supplies were then stockpiled, the navy was placed on standby, and military search and rescue vehicles were prepped.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Wayne {{became the}} second typhoon {{to strike the}} Philippines within nine days. Furthermore, 42people {{lost their lives in}} flood waters while {{attempting}} to cross a temporary bridge. A total of 28persons were hurt and 39 were rescued, and there were initially reports of up to 200people missing. Although Wayne passed south of Taiwan, moderate flooding was reported due <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> seas. Elsewhere, in China, Wayne was the fifth most intense typhoon on record to impact Fujian between 1960 and 2005. Throughout China, 440 persons were injured, 105people died, and 30,000dwellings collapsed. Overall, 147people were killed due to Typhoon Wayne.|$|E

5|$|By 11 January, the Apache Corporation began {{evacuating}} all non-essential {{personnel from}} oil rigs {{in the path}} of the storm. The Rio Tinto Group shut down iron exports at its Dampier and Cape Lambert ports due <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> seas. Across the Pilbara region, the State Emergency Service advised residents to secure loose objects and ensure their emergency kits were stocked. Incident management teams were also established to help people in the wake of the storm. Additionally, urban search and rescue equipment was set up in Karratha. Horizon Power dispatched additional linemen to the most at-risk areas in Narelle's path to speed up power restoration in the wake of the storm. In Carnarvon, mango producers picked as much of their fruit as possible before the storm arrived to minimise losses.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Calderon, Emily's {{doctor who}} works for a company called Prangen, refuses to {{transfer}} Emily's medical records to the County Children's Center, prompting Mulder <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> him up, but has to leave when security arrives. Later, Mulder follows Calderon after he leaves his office. Scully has imaging tests conducted on Emily. Calderon goes to see the Dark Suited Men, one of whom kills him by stabbing him in the neck with an alien stiletto; both men then morph into Calderon. Mulder follows as one of them leaves. The results of Emily's tests show her to be suffering from a tumorous infection. The other Calderon arrives at the hospital and injects Emily with an unknown green substance; he escapes by morphing into someone else. Scully believes that he is continuing the treatments, and the Sims were murdered because they were trying to stop him. Mulder follows the first Calderon clone into a building, where he meets Anna Fugazzi, an elderly woman in a nursing home.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} weak nature of the storm, impact was generally minor. Rip currents in Alabama and Florida led to five fatalities. The sixth death from the storm was also related <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> seas and occurred {{near the mouth of}} the Mississippi River in Louisiana. Storm surge and high tides also caused coastal flooding in the state, especially in Cameron Parish. Relatively strong winds left more than 2,000without electricity and damaged trees and the roofs of mobile homes. Storm surge caused coastal flooding in eastern Texas, particularly in the Gilchrist area. At least 25homes sustained damage, while portions of a few major roads, such as Interstate 10, were closed. Minor inland flooding occurred due to heavy rainfall, with a portion of Texas State Highway 36 being temporarily shutdown. Strong winds in the region damaged hundreds of homes, downed trees, and left about 300,000people without electricity. Overall, damage from Tropical Storm Edouard totaled slightly more than $550,000 (2008USD).|$|E

5|$|During the year, three {{tropical}} depressions, one subtropical storm, two tropical storms, {{and four}} hurricanes formed. It produced seven storms, {{less than the}} average of ten usually formed throughout an Atlantic hurricane season, while four of the storms {{went on to become}} hurricanes. The first cyclone to form inside the official season was Tropical Depression One, which formed on June 25. Of the four hurricanes, Hurricane Andrew was the most intense, reaching Category 5 status. In late June, Tropical Depression One caused severe flooding in southwestern Florida and Cuba; heavy rainfall was recorded in Pinar del Río, Matanzas, and Havana. When Andrew struck Florida and Louisiana in August, it became the second-costliest hurricane to hit the United States. Damages were estimated to be about $26.5 billion and 68 people were killed. Tropical Storm Danielle made landfall at the Delmarva Peninsula on the Virginian coast on September 25, causing minimal flooding. There was one recorded death recorded due to Danielle; a ship east of New Jersey was sunk due <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> seas. The season finished on October 30 when Hurricane Frances became an extratropical gale before dissipating.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, seven {{casualties}} {{occurred in}} the Laguna province, while one person perished each in San Pablo, Batangas, Marinduque and Mindoro Oriental. Thirty-twopeople {{were killed in the}} Camarines Sur province and 23other lives were lost in Camarines Norte. Five others were killed in the Masbate province, and one died in Marinduque. In Boac, the capital of Marinduque, 80%of all dwellings lost their roofs and damage was severe to churches, schools and city buildings. In Bacacay, situated to the southeast of Legaspi, all but 15of the town's 200dwellings were leveled. Although there were no deaths, Samar Island also suffered severe damage. Offshore, five fisherman perished and a tugboat and cargo ship were rendered missing due <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> seas. Nina also brought widespread power outages to most of Luzon; consequently, trading on the nation's two biggest stock exchange was suspended for November 26.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Madeline, {{the government of}} Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for the Baja California Peninsula southward from La Paz, and a hurricane warning from San Patricio, Jalisco to El Dorado, Sinaloa, including the Islas Marías. The storm was initially forecast to move ashore near Mazatlán, prompting officials to close the city's port. President Ernesto Zedillo advised potentially affected residents to stay indoors or seek refuge in shelters. Also, {{the threat of the}} hurricane canceled a fishing expedition in the Gulf of California due <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> surf. The expedition was to provide a new aquarium in downtown Denver, Colorado with about 8,500fish. Mexican authorities deployed 2,000soldiers in remote areas of the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa to prepare for the hurricane. Several thousand residents and tourists at the resorts of Puerto Vallarta and Mazatlan were put on standby to evacuate their homes. Authorities along the coast in the state of Nayarit went house to house, advising people about the oncoming storm. In addition, ships from Salina Cruz to Acapulco were advised to stay in port.|$|E
