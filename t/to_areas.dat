5|$|Cyclone Jasmine {{affected}} fivecountries {{during its}} existence. The predecessor to Jasmine brought heavy rainfall <b>to</b> <b>areas</b> of extreme northern Queensland. Jasmine also brought rainfall <b>to</b> <b>areas</b> of the Solomon Islands. As a result, pest infestations occurred across the region. In Vanuatu, heavy rains and wind from Jasmine destroy numerous crops. Banana trees {{in particular are}} affected by the cyclone. Jasmine inundated areas of Tonga that had already been affected by Cyclone Cyril just a week prior. Nuku'alofa recorded half of its average monthly rainfall in a 24‑hour span due to rains associated with the cyclone. After the season, the name Jasmine was retired from the Australian list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E

30|$|This system {{comprises}} ten generators with valve-point {{loading and}} multi-fuel sources having three fuel options. Transmission loss is considered here. The generator data {{has been taken}} from [13]. The total load demand is 2700 MW. The ten generators are divided into three areas. Area 1 consists of the first four units; area 2 includes the next three units and area 3 includes the last three units. The load demand in area 1 is assumed as 50 % of the total demand. The load demand in area 2 is assumed as 25 % and in area 3 is taken as 25 % of the total demand. The power flow limit from <b>area</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>area</b> 2 or from <b>area</b> 2 <b>to</b> <b>area</b> 1 is 100 MW.

Some crossed into Bolshevik Russia hoping to be repatriated together with the Romanian consulate, while others took <b>to</b> <b>areas</b> controlled by the White movement, reaching Irkutsk; still others escaped through northern routes into Sweden.
