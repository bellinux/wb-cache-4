5|$|Based on its composition, it {{is assumed}} that the magma at Licancabur formed from the partial melting of the oceanic crust subducted at the Peru-Chile Trench after metamorphosis.

50|$|There are {{specific}} actions associated with wotagei, such as physical poses and chants.

5|$|Frogs have three-chambered hearts, {{a feature}} they share with lizards. Oxygenated {{blood from the}} lungs and de-oxygenated blood from the respiring tissues enter the heart through {{separate}} atria. When these chambers contract, the two blood streams pass into a common ventricle before being pumped via a spiral valve to the appropriate vessel, the aorta for oxygenated blood and pulmonary artery for deoxygenated blood. The ventricle is partially divided into narrow cavities which minimizes <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> of {{the two types of}} blood. These features enable frogs to have a higher metabolic rate and be more active than would otherwise be possible.|$|E
5|$|However, Shakespeare {{soon began}} to adapt the {{traditional}} styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III {{has its roots in}} the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays. No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> of the styles. By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.|$|E
5|$|Hyderabad {{emerged as}} the {{foremost}} centre of culture in India with {{the decline of the}} Mughal Empire. After the fall of Delhi in 1857, the migration of performing artists to the city particularly from the north and west of the Indian sub continent, under the patronage of the Nizam, enriched the cultural milieu. This migration resulted in a mingling of North and South Indian languages, cultures and religions, which has since led to a co-existence of Hindu and Muslim traditions, for which the city has become noted. A further consequence of this north–south mix is that both Telugu and Urdu are official languages of Telangana. <b>The</b> <b>mixing</b> of religions has also resulted in many festivals being celebrated in Hyderabad such as Ganesh Chaturthi, Diwali and Bonalu of Hindu tradition and Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha by Muslims.|$|E
