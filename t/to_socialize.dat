5|$|In 1951, the California Supreme Court affirmed in Stoumen v. Reilly {{the right}} of homosexuals to {{assemble}} peacefully. To assist homosexuals with legal problems, in 1951 labor activist Harry Hay started the Mattachine Society, from his living room in Los Angeles. A few years later, Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin started the Daughters of Bilitis with six other women in San Francisco, initially {{to have a place}} <b>to</b> <b>socialize</b> without fear of harassment or arrest. Within a few years, both organizations learned of each other and grew to have similar goals: helping assimilate homosexuals into general society, working for legal reform to repeal sodomy laws, and assisting those who were arrested. Both groups were headquartered in San Francisco by 1957.|$|E

5|$|Women in Washington social circles led by Floride Calhoun, {{the wife}} of Vice President John C. Calhoun, snubbed the Eatons because they married so soon after John Timberlake's death, rather than waiting for the usual {{mourning}} period; there were stories that Eaton and Peggy Timberlake had been having an affair before John Timberlake had died. Rumors held that Peggy, as a barmaid in her father's tavern, had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute. Petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members, led by Mrs. Calhoun, refused <b>to</b> <b>socialize</b> with the Eatons. They refused to attend social events at which she would be present. According to Emily Donelson, Eaton considered resigning in {{the first months of}} the administration.|$|E
5|$|A {{party is}} {{held for the}} team, and Dax and Kahn warm to one another's company once more. Afterward, they begin <b>to</b> <b>socialize</b> as they work {{together}} on Kahn's wormhole experiment aboard USS Defiant. They agree to have dinner, but to also bring Bashir along as a chaperone. At the dinner, Bashir feels out of place and is effectively ignored by the two Trills. Returning to the tests, Kahn creates the first artificial wormhole in history and Dax hugs her in celebration. Kahn's brother Bejal (Tim Ryan), {{who is on the}} science team, speaks to her separately and highlights his concerns regarding her contact with Dax. Despite this, Kahn goes to Dax's quarters and a discussion between the two leads to a kiss; Kahn leaves before it goes any further.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} abroad, Cooper {{stayed with the}} Countess Dorothy di Frasso at the Villa Madama in Rome, where she taught him about good food and vintage wines, how to read Italian and French menus, and how <b>to</b> <b>socialize</b> among Europe's nobility and upper classes. After guiding him through the great art museums and {{galleries}} of Italy, she accompanied him on a ten-week big-game hunting safari {{on the slopes of}} Mount Kenya in East Africa, where he was credited with over sixty kills, including two lions, a rhinoceros, and various antelopes. His safari experience in Africa had a profound influence on Cooper and intensified his love of the wilderness. After returning to Europe, he and the countess set off on a Mediterranean cruise of the Italian and French Rivieras. Rested and rejuvenated by his year-long exile, a healthy Cooper returned to Hollywood in April 1932 and negotiated a new contract with Paramount for two films per year, a salary of $4,000 a week, and director and script approval.|$|E

5|$|Female California {{sea lions}} have a 12-month {{reproductive}} cycle, {{consisting of a}} 9-month actual gestation and a 3-month delayed implantation of the fertilized egg before giving birth in June or July. Interbirth intervals are particularly long for this species, being 21 days for sea lions off California and more than 30 days for sea lions in the Gulf of California. Females remain with their pups on shore for 10 days and nurse them. After this, females will go on foraging trips lasting as long as three days, returning to nurse their pups {{for up to a}} day. Pups left on shore tend to gather in nurseries <b>to</b> <b>socialize</b> and play. When returning from a trip, females call their pups with distinctive calls to which the pups will reply in kind. A mother and pup can distinguish each other's calls from those of other mothers and pups. At first, reunions largely depend on the efforts of the mothers. However, as pups get older, they get more involved in reunions. Older pups may sometimes join their mothers during their foraging trips. Adult male California sea lions play no role in raising pups, but they do take more interest in them than adult males of other otariid species; they have even been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Pups are weaned by a year but can continue to suckle for another year.|$|E
5|$|Pastor H.J. Pedersen, {{like most}} early pastors in the synod, had {{received}} his training in a folk school, {{and he was}} convinced that the success of the new congregation and colony depended on the establishment of such a Danish-speaking folk school. Danebod Folk School opened December1, 1888, with Pedersen as president. Other teachers were Carl Hansen and Christian Hansen. Among the first students were Niels Petersen and Kristian Klink, both Danish immigrants. Klink was a stonemason educated in Denmark, and he helped pastor Pedersen in building the Stone Hall. It was built of native rock. Farmers hauled rocks from the shores of Swan Lake just south of Danebod, and Klink and his helpers split and shaped the rocks. The Stone Hall was finished in the fall of 1889, and the first public gathering in the Stone Hall was at Klink's funeral in November 1889. The Stone Hall quickly became the center of the new colony, and Sunday services were conducted here, as well as numerous weddings, baptisms and funerals. The students at the Danebod Folk School used the building as a gym hall, and young people would meet here <b>to</b> <b>socialize,</b> meet up with friends, and participate in singing games. Three years later, the Stone Hall was now too small for worship services. It was decided to build a new church, and the Cross Church at Danebod was dedicated on Sunday, June16, 1895.|$|E
5|$|Women in {{homosexual}} relationships {{responded to}} this designation either by hiding their personal lives or accepting the label of outcast and creating a subculture and identity that developed in Europe and the United States. Following World War II, {{during a period of}} social repression when governments actively persecuted homosexuals, women developed networks <b>to</b> <b>socialize</b> with and educate each other. Greater economic and social freedom allowed them gradually to be able to determine how they could form relationships and families. With second wave feminism and growth of scholarship in women's history and sexuality in the 20th century, the definition of lesbian broadened, sparking a debate about sexual desire as the major component to define what a lesbian is. Some women who engage in same-sex sexual activity may reject not only identifying as lesbians but as bisexual as well, while other women's self-identification as lesbian may not align with their sexual orientation or sexual behavior; sexual identity is not necessarily the same as one's sexual orientation or sexual behavior, due to various reasons, such as the fear of identifying their sexual orientation in a homophobic setting.|$|E

50|$|Dog puppies require {{as little}} as 90 minutes of contact with humans during their {{critical}} period of socialization to form a social attachment. This will not create a highly social pet but a dog that will solicit human attention. Wolves require 24 hours contact a day starting before 3 weeks of age. <b>To</b> create a <b>socialized</b> wolf the pups are removed from the den at 10 days of age, kept in constant human contact until they are 4 weeks old when they begin to bite their sleeping human companions, then spend only their waking hours {{in the presence of}} humans. This socialization process continues until age 4 months, when the pups can join other captive wolves but will require daily human contact <b>to</b> remain <b>socialized.</b> Despite this intensive socialization process, a well-socialized wolf will behave differently to a well-socialized dog and will display species-typical hunting and reproductive behaviors, only closer to humans than a wild wolf. These wolves do not generalize their socialization to all humans {{in the same manner as}} a socialized dog and they remain more fearful of novelty compared <b>to</b> <b>socialized</b> dogs.|$|R
