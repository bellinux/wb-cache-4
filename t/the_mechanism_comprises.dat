40|$|The Recoverable Value cane {{payment system}} {{and length of}} milling season {{controls}} were introduced in SIA 2000 as an incentive to growers to improve cane quality. In addition to these controls, the effects of seasonal cane quality, scheduling of non-rateable deliveries and cane quality differences between different homogenous regions within mill areas {{need to be considered}} to maximise mill area productivity (i. e. maximise cane quality) and mill capacity utilisation (i. e. minimise no cane stops) in terms of cane delivery timing. This paper examines incentives within the current institutional framework surrounding cane supply and attempts to identify and correct existing delivery inefficiencies. The solution comprises a penalty allocation mechanism, which can be fully automated and incorporated into the Laboratory Information Management System, both of which are flexible and can accommodate specific circumstances at the different mill centres. <b>The</b> <b>mechanism</b> <b>comprises</b> delivery window periods such that the timing of deliveries can be traded, which encourages selective harvesting of the best quality cane available.

The increased accountability for deliveries enables Local Area Agreement penalties to be apportioned amongst those individuals responsible.

40|$|This review {{discusses}} principal {{patterns that}} govern the processes of lignins’ catalytic oxidation into vanillin (3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde) and syringaldehyde (3, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde). It examines the influence of lignin and oxidant nature, temperature, mass transfer, and of other factors on the yield of the aldehydes and the process selectivity. The review reveals that properly organized processes of catalytic oxidation of various lignins are only insignificantly (10 – 15 %) inferior to oxidation by nitrobenzene in terms of yield and selectivity in vanillin and syringaldehyde. Very high consumption of oxygen (and consequentially, of alkali) in the process—over 10 mol per mol of obtained vanillin—is highlighted as an unresolved and unexplored problem: scientific literature reveals almost no studies devoted to the possibilities of decreasing the consumption of oxygen and alkali. Different hypotheses about <b>the</b> <b>mechanism</b> of lignin oxidation into the aromatic aldehydes are discussed, and <b>the</b> <b>mechanism</b> <b>comprising</b> <b>the</b> steps of single-electron oxidation of phenolate anions, and ending with retroaldol reaction of a substituted coniferyl aldehyde was pointed out as the most convincing one.

40|$|Zirconium alloys {{are widely}} used in nuclear power plants as {{cladding}} material to contain the fission fuel in the reactor cores. A limiting factor for fuel longevity is the corrosion property of the zirconium alloys. The main corrodent in the reactor core is water. Ideally, the oxidation process of zirconium alloys with water should be accompanied by molecular hydrogen release into the surrounding, but {{a significant amount of}} hydrogen is absorbed into the alloy. This process is called hydrogen pick-up, and is along with the oxidation rate decisive to the longevity of the fuel. The mechanisms controlling the hydrogen pick-up are to a large extent unknown. In this study, density functional theory, DFT, was used to gain insights into the mechanism for water induced corrosion of zirconium. The steady state process whereby Zr is oxidized by means of oxide ions at the metal/oxide interface comprises the anode process. This implies release of two electrons of the oxide ion. A sink for these electrons is offered by H+ ions, whereby H 2 is formed or hydrogen picked up in the metal. These comprise the cathode processes. A detailed mechanism for electro-catalytic hydrogen evolution was explored. <b>The</b> <b>mechanism</b> <b>comprises</b> formation of a TM-H-Zr three-center hydride ion, followed by a hydride-proton recombination step forming H 2. The efficiency of the system to utilize the overpotential for hydrogen evolution was found to be decisive for the fraction of hydrogen that is absorbed in the alloy. The ability of the anode process to sustain the cathode process was investigated, both by addressing the anode potential and its variations with respect to oxygen distribution. Diffusion barriers for redistribution of oxygen atoms in the α-Zr matrix were quantified, and the finding was taken to suggest the possible roles of meta-stable oxygen distributions to the change in hydrogen pick-up fraction. In addition, the drive for hydrogen pick-up by co-absorption with oxygen in α-Zr was studied and shown to be beneficial relative to H 2 (g) for oxygen concentrations well above the oxygen solubility limit...|$|E
