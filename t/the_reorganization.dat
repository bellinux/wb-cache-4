5|$|In 1944, Pierlot began {{drawing up}} plans for <b>the</b> <b>reorganization</b> of the Belgian Army after the liberation, {{known as the}} Pierlot Plan (Plan Pierlot). The plan called for the {{formation}} of two brigades of infantry, six battalions of fusiliers, logistics and support units in Belgium immediately after liberation in order to fight alongside Allied troops during an invasion of Germany. In the longer term, these troops would form the core of a new division around which more troops could be raised.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, the {{division}} was reorganized {{in accordance with}} <b>the</b> <b>Reorganization</b> Objective Army Divisions plan, eliminating its regimental commands in favor of brigades. The division took command of 1st Brigade, 29th Infantry Division and 2nd Brigade, 29th Infantry Division of the Virginia Army National Guard, as well as 3rd Brigade, 29th Infantry Division of the Maryland Army National Guard. The division continued its service in the National Guard under this new organization.|$|E
5|$|In France, the premiership of Aristide Briand, {{a leading}} proponent of {{engaging}} with Constantine {{to bring about}} a reconciliation of the two Greek administrations, was threatened by the events in Athens, leading to <b>the</b> <b>reorganization</b> of the French government. In Britain, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and foreign minister Sir Edward Grey resigned and were replaced by Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour. The change in the British leadership proved to be particularly important for Greece, since Lloyd George was a known Hellenophile, an admirer of Venizelos and dedicated to resolving the Eastern Question.|$|E
40|$|Theory {{suggests}} that reorganizing common shares into shares with different voting rights {{may reduce the}} effectiveness of corporate control mechanisms, decreasing firm value. Firms argue that creating a class of restricted (nonvoting or subordinate voting) equity may enhance firm value by improving liquidity, facilitating Canadian ownership and allowing {{the maintenance of the}} existing vote ownership. An event study of fifty-four proposals by Canadian firms to reorganize existing common shares into full voting and restricted classes finds that <b>the</b> <b>reorganizations</b> not associated with a change in dividends generate significantly negative abnormal returns, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>reorganizations</b> reduce firm value. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Korean War, between 1953 and 1971, the 7th Infantry Division defended the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Its main {{garrison}} was Camp Casey, South Korea.

In 1963, the division's former headquarters company grew into the 1st Brigade, 7th Infantry Division.

5|$|States' {{militias and}} Federal troops {{attached}} to the Army of the Potomac, including the newly reorganized 11th New York, were dispatched to quell the riots. Other regiments utilized included the 152nd New York, the 26th Michigan, the 27th Indiana and the 7th Regiment New York State Militia, which arrived from Frederick, Maryland after a forced march. In addition, New York governor Horatio Seymour sent the 74th and 65th regiments of the New York state militia, which had not been federalized, and {{a section of the}} 20th Artillery from Fort Schuyler in Throgs Neck. At the height of the violence, Colonel O'Brien, the 11th Regiment's commanding officer, was seized by the mob, beaten, and killed. In the wake of the riots, <b>the</b> <b>reorganization</b> produced few recruits and stalled. On October 1, 1863, <b>the</b> <b>reorganization</b> was discontinued and the men who had enlisted were transferred to the 17th Veteran Infantry Regiment.|$|E

5|$|The college had a precipitous {{decline in}} {{enrollment}} and financial stability {{during and after}} the Great Depression, weathering the storm under five successive presidents. Its survival was due in part to <b>the</b> <b>reorganization</b> of the six-year preparatory program into a four-year junior college program and in part to steep salary reductions. In 1943, Shimer president Albin C. Bro invited the Department of Education at the University of Chicago to evaluate the college community; its 77 recommendations became the basis for Shimer's transformation from a conservative finishing school to a nontraditional, co-educational four-year college.|$|E
5|$|Undaunted by {{the failure}} of the bond issue, Fields {{returned}} to the 1926 General Assembly with more proposals, including another increase in the gasoline tax to provide the funds needed to construct the state highway system. The 1926 Assembly passed more legislation than any previous legislature, including the increased gas tax and several bills to reorganize state government. The state purchasing commission and the Department of Bus Transportation were among the entities created in <b>the</b> <b>reorganization.</b> Under Fields, the state implemented the first phase of desegregation busing.|$|E

5|$|As the {{hurricane}} neared the Florida Keys on September25, its eye reformed and became more pronounced on satellite imagery. <b>The</b> <b>reorganization</b> {{led to an}} increase in intensity, and at about 1530UTC, Georges made landfall near Key West with winds of 105mph (160km/h). The hurricane's forward motion shifted to west-northwest, and forecast models indicated that Georges would re-attain Category 3 status before making landfall along the northern Gulf Coast. The slow motion of the storm led to an erratic track, mainly caused by westward wobbles of the eye. Vertical wind shear was estimated at up to 35mph (55km/h), restricting outflow within {{the hurricane}} and confining the most intense convection to {{the eastern side of the}} circulation.|$|E
5|$|By 1826, {{economic}} prosperity {{was beginning to}} return to the state. The Old Court party augmented their majority in the House and gained a majority in the Senate. One legislator's proposition to resolve the controversy was to call for the resignation of the governor and lieutenant governor, the entire General Assembly, as well as the justices from both the Old and New Courts, essentially allowing the state to reset its entire government. This extreme measure was rejected. Instead, on December 29, 1826, the General Assembly repealed <b>the</b> <b>reorganization</b> act, and overrode Governor Desha's veto of the measure. They also repealed the replevin law that had touched off the controversy. On January 1, 1827, Francis Blair returned the court records in his possession to the Old Court.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>reorganization</b> {{of legal}} {{education}} in Ontario in the mid-1950s, Queen's Faculty of Law opened in 1957 {{in the newly}} built John A. Macdonald Hall.

By {{the end of the}} 1960s, like many other universities in Canada, Queen's tripled its enrolment and greatly expanded its faculty, staff, and facilities, {{as a result of the}} baby boom and generous support from the public sector.

40|$|We {{describe}} a heteromolecular single crystal that exhibits three reversible and concerted reorganizations upon heating and cooling. The products of <b>the</b> <b>reorganizations</b> are conformational polymorphs. <b>The</b> <b>reorganizations</b> are postulated to proceed through three motions: (i) alkyl translations, (ii) olefin rotations, and (iii) rotational tilts. The motions are akin to rack-and-pinion gears {{at the molecular}} level. The rack-like movement is based on expansions and compressions of alkyl chains that are coupled with pinion-like 180 ° rotations of olefins. To accommodate the movements, phenol and thiophene components undergo rotational tilts about intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The movements are collective, being propagated in close-packed repeating units. This discovery marks a step to understanding how organic solids can support the development of crystalline molecular machines and devices through correlated and collective movements...|$|R
