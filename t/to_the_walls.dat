5|$|Deeper (average: 3m) {{and much}} wider (av. 10m) {{perimeter}} ditches (fossae). These would have flat floors {{rather than the}} traditional V-shape. Such ditches would {{make it difficult to}} bring siege equipment (ladders, rams, and other engines) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> It would also concentrate attackers in an enclosed area where they would be exposed to missile fire from the walls.|$|E
5|$|Despite Langdale's {{attempt to}} counter-charge, the Royalists were soon outflanked. With the Parliamentarian musketeers firing {{into the rear}} of Langdale's force, the Royalists broke, some {{escaping}} via Holt Bridge and others running towards Chester. On Hoole Heath these retreating soldiers met with part of Gerard's force and made an initially successful counter-attack before being forced back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of Chester. There the retreating cavalry choked up the streets, allowing the Parliamentarian musketeers to fire into the confused mass of horsemen and leading to a rout.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this plan}} only applied to men manning {{the walls of}} the fort, not the artillerymen who would be serving the fort's guns.

5|$|Impermeable plasma {{is a type}} {{of thermal}} plasma which acts like an {{impermeable}} solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically pushed. Interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by Hannes Alfvén in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of fusion plasma from the reactor walls. However, later {{it was found that the}} external magnetic fields in this configuration could induce kink instabilities in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1876, the {{congregation}} voted {{by a margin}} of over two to one to re-orient the synagogue pews in the manner of Christian churches, and introduce mixed seating. However, nothing was done about this until 1879, when the renovations were carried out: the front pews were removed, the side pews extended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> and the vestibule moved outside the sanctuary. Led by rabbi Dr. E. M. Myers, the synagogue was re-dedicated on September 7.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Wat Tyler's entrance in 1381, in 1450, Jack Cade and 4,000 rebels were barred entry {{from the city}} at West Gate. In 1533, Canterbury reacted with concern to the news of Thomas Wyatt's rebellion in Kent; repairs were made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> guns and ammunition mobilised, and the Riding Gate was blocked up. Queen Mary later thanked the city for their efforts.|$|E
50|$|If the thrower's ball bounces {{before hitting}} <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>the</b> thrower must run <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and touch <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> before an {{opponent}} {{can pick up}} the ball and throw it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> If <b>the</b> original thrower doesn't make contact with <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> before <b>the</b> ball reaches <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>the</b> original thrower is out. If the thrower reaches for the ball, but has it bounce off his fingers and onto the pavement, this counts as missing the throw, and he must run <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|R
50|$|While the no-slip {{condition}} is used almost universally in modeling of viscous flows, {{it is sometimes}} neglected {{in favor of the}} 'no-penetration condition' (where the fluid velocity normal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> is set <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> velocity in this direction, but the fluid velocity parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> is unrestricted) in elementary analyses of inviscid flow, where the effect of boundary layers is neglected.|$|R

5|$|Llywelyn's power {{declined}} {{over the}} next two decades. In 1276 Henry's son, Edward I, invaded Wales following a dispute with the prince, breaking his power in South Wales, and in 1282 Edward's second campaign resulted in Llwelyn's death and the collapse of independent Welsh rule. Further defences were added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> until work stopped around 1290. Local disputes remained. De Clare argued with Humphrey de Bohun, the earl of Hereford, in 1290 and the following year the case was brought before the king, resulting in the temporary royal seizure of Caerphilly.|$|E
5|$|The Ballroom, {{the last}} of the palace's three largest rooms, (illustrated below) was {{designed}} by Robillon in 1760. To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms. The ormolu Rococo ornament takes the form of heavy gilding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> and ceiling, of such richness that it has been compared with that of François de Cuvilliés' Amalienburg at Schloss Nymphenburg. The walls and doors are mirrored and the painted and gilded, coffered ceiling is supported by golden caryatids.|$|E
5|$|The {{budget for}} the works was £420,000, with initial work focused on {{stabilising}} the foundations and lower masonry. Much of this was achieved through the injection of stabilising materials into the foundations, which needed time to cure and solidify. Works then progressed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> and roof, and finally the decorative embellishments. Today, while part of the Orangery is a dedicated café, the rest is an international education centre of excellence for the Trust, training new craftsmen and restoration specialists.|$|E

50|$|Chicken Drops: An {{alternative}} to Savies.

Females adhere eggs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of the cave.|$|E
5|$|After {{their own}} house was {{destroyed}} in the Great Kantō earthquake, Raymond designed a new one, the Reinanzaka House, in Azabu, Tokyo. His desire to free himself from Wright's influence led him to explore spatial relationships between living, working and dining areas and how spaces could be closed off with folding screens.The house is built almost entirely of in situ concrete. Raymond's workforce were enthusiastic {{in their use of}} this new material, likening it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of traditional kura storehouses. The house itself had metal fenestration, tubular steel trellises and traditional rain chains rather than rainwater downpipes. The interior too was well in advance of other houses of the International Style with the use of cantilevered tubular steel furniture.|$|E
5|$|Around 1800, Caernarfon's local {{corporation}} {{undertook a}} programme of modernisation work, inserting several new gateways {{in the town}} walls; other changes were also made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> during the period, with some towers being converted for use as administrative buildings and the gatehouses altered to accommodate more modern offices. During the 19th century the town of Caernarfon grew considerably, prompted by the slate trade {{and the construction of}} the Chester to Holyhead railway line. As a result of this population pressure, by the 20th century housing had encroached along the inside and outside of the town walls, so that in many places the walls had vanished from view. During the 20th century the walls were gradually acquired by the state and these houses demolished.|$|E

5|$|Deep frying {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of waste oil, which must be disposed of properly. Waste oil can overflow sewage systems, bind <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of sewage pipes, and interfere with sewage treatment. Waste oil from deep frying is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes {{the time required to}} deep fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2,000 watts.|$|E
5|$|Further {{disturbances}} {{took place}} during the troubled reign of Mary, Queen of Scots (1542–1567), and its aftermath. In 1558 the Protestant Lords of the Congregation marched on Edinburgh against the Catholic French Regent, Mary of Guise, and were able {{to take control of the}} town without difficulty, despite the guards posted at the city gate. Following the forced abdication of Queen Mary, Scotland's nobility was divided between her supporters, and those of the infant King James VI, represented by a series of regents. Edinburgh was held for the Queen by William Kirkcaldy of Grange, and in May 1571 the town was besieged by the Regent's forces under James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton. Repairs were made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> and the Netherbow was barricaded. Nearby houses were pulled down to improve defences, and the siege gun Mons Meg was employed to batter houses outside the wall which were being used by snipers. Unable to make any headway, the besiegers withdrew on 20 May.|$|E

These crews would be permanently located at the fort, unlike the men assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of the fort. To fire Fort Greble's planned complement of 15 guns, Barnard assigned 255 artillerymen. This plan was affected by the needs of the war. As the fighting dragged on and casualties mounted, the various commanders of the Army of the Potomac repeatedly raided the Washington garrison for trained artillerymen and infantry replacements. By 1864, Washington had been stripped to a total less than half that of Barnard's 1861 recommendation.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, to {{mark the}} seventh centenary {{of the birth of}} King James I, Gaudí {{designed}} a monument in his memory. It would have been situated in the Plaça del Rei, and would have also meant the renovation of the adjacent buildings: new roof for the cathedral, as well as the completion of its towers and cupola; placement of three vases above the buttresses of the Chapel of Santa Àgada, dedicated to the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary, as well as the figure of an angel on top of the chapel's tower; finally, the opening of a large square next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> (now the Plaça Ramon Berenguer el Grand). The project was not executed because the city council disliked it.|$|E
5|$|In late August, Montgomery sailed {{north from}} Fort Ticonderoga with about 1,200 men. After {{successfully}} besieging Fort Saint-Jean, he captured Montreal on November 13. The two men joined forces in early December, {{and with their}} combined force of about 1,200 soldiers, they attacked Quebec on December 31, 1775. The colonial forces suffered a disastrous defeat {{at the hands of}} General Guy Carleton, governor of Quebec and commander of the British forces. Montgomery was killed leading an assault along with all but one of his officers; his men never got close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> Arnold's force made a descent into the lower town. Early in the battle, Arnold was wounded in the leg, but stayed on the battlefield encouraging his troops on. Daniel Morgan's rifle company, the most successful of the American troops, fought inside the city until Morgan was cornered and forced to surrender. Many others were killed or wounded, and hundreds were taken prisoner.|$|E

Believing she threatens his position and will require expenditure of treasure, Charles conspires {{to get rid of}} Joan by allowing her to be captured by enemy forces. She is taken prisoner by the pro-English Burgundians at Compiègne, who sell her to the English.|$|E
