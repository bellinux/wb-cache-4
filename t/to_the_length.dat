5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of RNA chain, RNA {{includes}} small RNA {{and long}} RNA. Usually, small RNAs are shorter than 200nt in length, and long RNAs {{are greater than}} 200nt long. Long RNAs, also called large RNAs, mainly include long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA. Small RNAs mainly include 5.8S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), 5S rRNA, transfer RNA (tRNA), microRNA (miRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs), Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), tRNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA) and small rDNA-derived RNA (srRNA).|$|E

5|$|Ellis {{started the}} 1967 season with Columbus. He {{believed}} {{that he was not}} on the major league club because the Pirates already had a number of African American players; he felt that the team did not want to alienate white fans. Ellis was sent down to the Macon Peaches of the Southern League, which Ellis believed was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of his hair. Ellis said that he was promoted back to Columbus after shaving his head. He had a 2–0 win-loss record with Macon and a 5–7 record with Columbus.|$|E

5|$|In most fish, the {{esophagus}} is extremely short, primarily due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of the pharynx (which {{is associated with}} the gills). However, some fish, including lampreys, chimaeras, and lungfish, have no true stomach, so that {{the esophagus}} effectively runs from the pharynx directly to the intestine, and is therefore somewhat longer.|$|E

5|$|Most comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies with {{elongated}} elliptical orbits that take them {{close to the}} Sun for {{a part of their}} orbit and then out into the further reaches of the Solar System for the remainder.

5|$|The diet {{consists}} of water-based and terrestrial insects, flying insects, such as {{various types of}} fly, and, to a lesser extent, tiny crustaceans and algae. Field work on Narrabeen Lakes showed that Pacific blue-eyes spent time near the surface looking for dead flying insects, consuming anything below their mouth gape size. This varied from around 2.5 to 3.5mm, and was proportional <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of the fish. The Pacific blue-eye forages using vision, and the turbidity of the water affects its ability to find food.|$|E

The flying flag has to be raised in its entirety, clean, and unfaded; moreover, the lower part of the flag should be at least 2.5 m off the ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of Greenlandic {{is highly}} synthetic and exclusively suffixing, {{with the exception}} of a single highly limited and fossilized demonstrative prefix. It creates very long words by means of adding strings of suffixes to a stem. In principle there is no limit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of a Greenlandic word, but in practice words with more than half a dozen derivational suffixes are not so frequent, and the average number of morphemes per word is 3 to 5. The language employs around 318 inflectional suffixes and between four and five hundred derivational ones.|$|E

5|$|Among Beshear's other {{activities}} as lieutenant governor was {{his participation in}} an investigation of Kentucky Utilities' coal-buying practices. At issue was whether it was legal and ethical for the company's coal buyer to accept gifts and other perks from coal suppliers. Beshear had clashed with the company over similar issues during his term as attorney general. The company attempted to block Beshear's participation in the investigation, but the Kentucky Public Service Commission rejected the attempt. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of the investigation {{and the number of}} appeals filed, the matter was not fully adjudicated until 1992, well past the end of Beshear's term. The Kentucky Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of Kentucky Utilities.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} April, Himmler ordered Berger {{to obtain}} 20,000 new {{recruits}} for the Waffen-SS {{by the end of}} May. With Hitler's authorisation, the recruitment quotas were lifted by the Wehrmacht, allowing Berger an essentially free hand for a limited time. He did not disappoint, misleading the new recruits as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of their service obligation, and signing up 22,361 new troops by 29 May, many of whom were only 18 years old. To meet Himmler's target, Berger had also called up eligible members of the Allgemeine SS and intensified efforts to recruit western Europeans. The latter initiative proved disappointing, with only 2,000 of the total coming from that source. A total of 400 Finnish combat veterans also volunteered to join the Waffen-SS in this period, and they were sent to join the SS-Division-Wiking.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of {{the front}} created by the German summer offensive, aimed at taking the Caucasus oil fields {{and the city of}} Stalingrad, German and other Axis forces were forced to guard sectors beyond the length they were meant to occupy. The {{situation}} was exacerbated by the German decision to relocate several mechanized divisions from the Soviet Union to Western Europe. Furthermore, units in the area were depleted after months of fighting, especially those which took part in the fighting in Stalingrad. The Germans could only count on the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps, which had the strength of a single panzer division, and the 29th Panzergrenadier Division as reserves to bolster their Romanian allies on the German Sixth Army's flanks. In comparison, the Red Army deployed over one million personnel for the purpose of beginning the offensive in and around Stalingrad. Soviet troop movements were not without problems, due to the difficulties of concealing their build-up, and to Soviet units commonly arriving late due to logistical issues. Operation Uranus was first postponed from 8 to 17 November, then to 19 November.|$|E

5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> {{of time it}} took {{to build}} her, Wisconsin missed much of the initial thrust into Japanese-held territory, having arrived {{at a time when the}} reconquest of the Philippines was well underway. As a part of that movement, the {{planners}} had envisioned landings on the southwest coast of Mindoro, south of Luzon. From that point, American forces could threaten Japanese shipping lanes through the South China Sea. In preparation for the coming invasion of Mindoro, Wisconsin was assigned to protect the 3rd Fleet's Fast Carrier Task Force (TF 38), as they conducted air raids at Manila to soften up Japanese positions.|$|E
5|$|Helical: These viruses are {{composed}} of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions: These can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material, in general, single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases, is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, {{the length of a}} helical capsid is related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of the nucleic acid contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus {{is an example of a}} helical virus.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes of}} the episode {{contained}} backgrounds that were added with digital effects. One such scene was on Danny's ex-wife's house, which did not have mountains in the background; the mountains were digitally added in post-production. The same technique was used again on the village of quonset huts, and again on the freighter assault scenes, only with {{the background of the}} sea when Hesse and McGarrett fight. After the episode was filmed, the producers discovered that it was too long and spent two weeks deciding what to cut out. One of the scenes involved the team deciding on a name of their task force, but that scene was cut in favor of another episode. Manning's scenes were also cut due from the final broadcast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>length,</b> though viewers could still make out {{the top of her head}} in the finished episode.|$|E
