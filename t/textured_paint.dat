Collectors distinguish slight production variants as the M35, M40 and M42. Heer helmets were originally painted [...] "apple green," [...] a semigloss feldgrau somewhat darker than the uniform color; wartime factory and field painting covered a gamut from very dark black-green to slate-grey to olive-green (and sand-yellow in Africa), increasingly in matte or <b>textured</b> <b>paint</b> to eliminate reflections. The Army began issuing camouflage helmet covers in 1942, first in Splittertarnmuster (splinter-pattern) and then in Sumpftarnmuster (swamp/marsh or [...] "water" [...] pattern); these were never plentiful and individual soldiers frequently improvised helmet covers from splinter-pattern Zeltbahn (tent/poncho) fabric, or less frequently hand-painted their helmets in camouflage patterns. Soldiers would also cover their helmets with netting or chicken wire into which foliage could be inserted. Prewar and early-war Army Stahlhelme had shield-shaped decals on either side, black-white-red diagonal stripes {{on the right and}} the Heeresadler (Army eagle) in silver-grey on the left; in 1940 the national colors and then in 1943 the eagle were discontinued, and existing decals were often covered up during repainting.

We investigated bed bug vision by determining their responses to different colors, vertical objects, {{and their ability to}} detect colors and vertical objects under low and complete dark conditions. Results show black and red paper harborages are preferred compared to yellow, green, blue, and white harborages. A bed bug trapping device with a black or red exterior surface was significantly more attractive to bed bugs than that with a white exterior surface. Bed bugs exhibited strong orientation behavior toward vertical objects. The height (15 vs. 30 cm tall) and color (brown vs. black) of the vertical object had no significant effect on orientation behavior of bed bugs. Bed bugs could differentiate color and detect vertical objects at very low background light conditions, but not in complete darkness. Bed bug preference to different substrate textures (mechanoreception) was also explored. Bed bugs preferred dyed tape compared to <b>painted</b> tape, <b>textured</b> <b>painted</b> plastic, and felt.

40|$|We address {{segmentation}} of {{an image}} into patches that have an underlying salient surface-roughness. Three intrinsic images are derived: reflectance, shading and metatexture images. A constructive approach is proposed for computing a meta-texture image by preserving, equalizing and enhancing the underlying surface-roughness across color, brightness and illumination variations. We evaluate the performance on sample images and illustrate quantitatively that different patches of the same material, in an image, are normalized in their statistics despite variations in color, brightness and illumination. Finally, segmentation by line-based boundary-detection is proposed and results are provided and compared to known algorithms. 1. Background Image segmentation of scenes in which man-made objects are presented in their diversity of appearance is a challenging computer vision problem. For example, while clothing is, perhaps, the most diverse of such objects, its basic components can be simply reduced to: the material of the thread (i. e., the fiber such as cotton, wool, silk, etc.), {{the thickness of the}} thread and the particular weaving pattern. Figure 1 shows images we are interested to analyze and segment, (a) rug on a hardwood floor, (b) woman with colorful hair, (c) wool sweater laid on a wood surface and (d) <b>textured</b> <b>painting</b> hanging on a wall. Our objective is to delineate regions that have a salient surface texture despite significant variations in color, brightness and illumination attributes. Specifically, we seek the separation of the rug, hair, sweater and painting. We use the term metatexture to convey and accentuate the underlying appearance of rough surfaces in the image plane to differentiate from texture that conveys the color patterns on a smooth surface and 3 D-textons that are tuned to the natural appearance of monochromatic surface roughness under viewpoint and illumination variations.

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} a wide {{disconnection}} between the real and virtual worlds in computer graphics. Art created with <b>textured</b> <b>paints</b> on canvases have visual effects which naturally supplement simple color. Real paint exhibits shadows and highlights, which change in response to viewing and lighting directions. The colors interact with this environment and can produce very noticeable effects. Additionally, the traditional means of human-computer interaction using a keyboard and mouse is unnatural and inefficient [...] -gestures and actions are not performed on the objects themselves. These visual effects and natural interactions are missing from digital media in the virtual world. The absence of these visual characteristics disconnects users from their content. Our research looks into simulating these missing pieces and reconnecting users. TangiPaint is an interactive, tangible application for creating and exploring digital media. It gives the experience of working with real materials, such as oil <b>paints</b> and <b>textured</b> canvases, on a digital display. TangiPaint implements natural gestures and allows users to directly interact with their work. The Tangible Display technology allows users to tilt and reorient the device and screen to see the subtle gloss, shadow, and impasto lighting effects of the simulated surface. To simulate realistic lighting effects we use a Ward BRDF illumination model. This model is implemented as an OpenGL shader program. Our system tracks the texture and relief of a piece of art by saving topographical information. We implement height fields, normal vectors, and parameter maps to store this information. These textures are submitted to the lighting model that renders a final product. TangiPaint builds on previous work and applications in this area, but is the first to integrate these aspects into a single software application. The system is entirely self-contained and implemented on the Apple iOS platforms, the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. No additional hardware is required and the interface is easy to learn and use. TangiPaint {{is a step in the}} direction of interactive digital art media that looks and behaves like real materials...|$|R
5000|$|The Parisian {{experience}} led him {{to analyze}} the human condition under a psychological profile. He had already started on this theme some years before, and it would accompany him throughout his artistic production. In {{the first half of}} the 60s he also experiments with different painting techniques, including materic <b>textured</b> <b>painting</b> that recall Rembrandt and Francis Bacon - as in LUscita dal Metrò e Composizione of 1963. In the same year, he undertook his fundamental research for a new figuration where the image is created from light; a modus operandi that characterized his entire career and of which he was a pioneer through an attentive and careful study of works by Piero della Francesca and Caravaggio. From the mid-1960s, his attention focused on the representation of mechanical objects and the waste of the consumer society; such as tubular and fences, immersed in a monotone light where the line between dignity and degradation is blurred and a sense of loneliness and anxiety pervades all. This sense of claustrophobia of the everyday is also found in the production of the first years of the 1970s. In the series of the Bocciatori and Interni , the use of cold light has a fundamental role in creating an uneasiness in the everyday situations and gestures represented, as well as in the play between solid and void. References to Vermeers paintings have been made in relation to Verrusios interpretation of rural life and still lifes. Here the light undergoes a tonal change to warmer colours, and normality becomes a solemn moment. Representative of these themes are the Still Lives with Figs and Lemons and the portrait of Natuccio and Giovannina of 1975. The most abstract form of this poetic and pictorial approach is found in the series of the Sassi, which began almost a decade earlier during a visit to the Island of Elba.
