500|$|Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) and {{her parents}} Maria (Lesley Manville) and Richard (Tim Pigott-Smith) move to the (fictional) {{industrial}} town of Milton, Darkshire, {{in the north of}} England because her father, a clergyman, decides to leave the Church of England and become a Nonconformist. [...] Thanks to his friend, Mr. Bell (Brian Protheroe), he is able to find a house and gains employment as a private tutor. [...] One of his pupils is local mill-owner John Thornton (Richard Armitage), who gets off to a bad start with Margaret when she witnesses him beating a worker whom he has caught smoking in the mill, thus endangering all the workers. Gradually, Margaret gets used to Thornton, but his mother Hannah (Sinéad Cusack) and sister Fanny (Jo Joyner) disapprove of her, believing her haughty and alien to the customs of the North. In the meantime, Margaret attempts to do charitable work among the working classes, and thus comes into contact with Nicholas Higgins (Brendan Coyle) and his daughter, Bessy (Anna Maxwell Martin), who contracted Pneumoconiosis from exposure to the cotton-fibres in the mills. [...] When Bessy became ill at Hamper's Mill, her father moved her to Marlborough Mills, Thornton's mill, because the working environment is better there. In a meeting with fellow mill owners, Thornton says he had a wheel for ventilation installed in all of the rooms of his factory, despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> a great deal of money. The other industrialists had refused to install a wheel because of the expense.|$|E

[...] Sarah Fitzmaurice of Daily Mail also gave a positive review for the video praising its simple and energetic concept accompanied by the [...] "fierce outfits". A writer of OK! compared the video with Will Smiths work in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air adding that Beyoncé [...] "has gone back to video basics." [...] A writer of The Huffington Post called the video a [...] "fresh take on a New Edition classic" [...] and concluded that it was a [...] "lot more simple than it sounds." [...] Lisa Potter of Marie Claire also praised the energy and Beyoncé's figure in the video, writing, [...] "The pregnant superstar puts on another energetic performance during the video, showing off her fabulous figure in a skimpy black leotard complete with a military fetish cap and Isabel Marant sneakers, before changing into a series of tailored suits." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that the video was similar to Michael Jackson's Dangerous era adding, [...] "While some might say the basic concept of Beyoncé's [...] 'Love On Top' video is too straightforward, we actually think it's amazing – just let Beyoncé sing, dance, look fuhLAWless and wear a cute hat! What else do you people need?!" [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice described the video as a direct homage to New Edition's [...] "If It Isn't Love" [...] but added that when the song's key changes start, [...] "Beyoncé and her posse of backup dancers get a bit brassier and fancier". She further wrote that the video was something that Phil Collins [...] "would be proud" [...] of.|$|E

2500|$|The first solar [...] "cars" [...] were {{actually}} tricycles or Quadracycles built with bicycle technology. These were called solarmobiles {{at the first}} solar race, the Tour de Sol in Switzerland in 1985. With 72 participants, half used solar power exclusively while the other half used solar-human-powered hybrids. A few true solar bicycles were built, either with a large solar roof, a small rear panel, or a trailer with a solar panel. Later more practical solar bicycles were built with foldable panels {{to be set up}} only during parking. Even later the panels were left at home, feeding into the electric mains, and the bicycles charged from the mains. Today highly developed electric bicycles are available and these use so little power <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> little to buy the equivalent amount of solar electricity. The [...] "solar" [...] has evolved from actual hardware to an indirect accounting system.
