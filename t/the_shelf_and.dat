25|$|There {{has always}} been a close and affectionate tie between the Notre Dame Band {{and the rest of the}} Notre Dame community. Rev. Edward Sorin, C.S.C., who founded the {{university}} in 1842, is strongly rumored to have been a clarinet player. And while it is possible that the Notre Dame Band and musical studies originated with the university that same year, the earliest reference to the band is in 1846 when it played at the first graduation ceremony. The importance of music on campus also caused a Music Hall/Auditorium to be built as the third major building of the new school after the classroom/dormitory building (The Golden Dome) and the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Indiana. The legendary football coach, Knute Rockne, played flute for Notre Dame, and former Athletic Director Edward Moose Krause spent some years studying music before putting his clarinet on <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> <b>and</b> devoting himself to athletics.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, Tucker {{organized}} a sit-in at Alexandria Library, which refused to issue library cards to black residents. On August 21, five {{young black men}} whom Tucker had recruited and instructed – William Evans, Otto L. Tucker, Edward Gaddis, Morris Murray, and Clarence Strange – entered the library one by one, requested applications for library cards and, when refused, each one took a book off <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> <b>and</b> {{sat down in the}} reading room until they were removed by the police. Tucker had instructed the men to dress well, speak politely and offer no resistance to the police so as to minimize the chance of the men being found guilty of disorderly conduct or resisting arrest. Tucker defended the men in the ensuing legal actions, which resulted in the disorderly conduct charges against the protestors being dropped by city attorney Armistead Boothe (who would later become a key figure in desegregating Virginia schools), and in a branch library being established for blacks.|$|E

25|$|The Privy Chamber of Murat III (III. Murad Has Odası) is {{the oldest}} and finest {{surviving}} room in the harem, having retained its original interior. It was a design of the master architect Sinan and dates from the 16th century. Its dome is only slightly smaller {{than that of the}} Throne Room. Its hall has one of the finest doors of the palace and leads past the wing of the crown princes (Kafes). The room is decorated with blue-and-white and coral-red İznik tiles. The rich floral designs are framed in thick orange borders of the 1570s. A band of inscriptional tiles runs around the room above <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> <b>and</b> door level. The large arabesque patterns of the dome have been regilded and repainted in black and red. The large fireplace with gilded hood (ocak) stands opposite a two-tiered fountain (çeşme), skilfully decorated in coloured marble. The flow of water was meant to prevent any eavesdropping, while providing a relaxed atmosphere to the room. The two gilded baldachin beds date from the 18th century.|$|E

50|$|In {{the real}} world when you visit a shop <b>the</b> <b>shelves</b> <b>and</b> {{products}} are not placed in a random order.
