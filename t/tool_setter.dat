50|$|The {{evolution}} of the workshops trade has {{been the result of}} the amalgamation of more specialist trades such as blacksmith and welder, coppersmith and metal worker, metal worker, and machine <b>tool</b> <b>setter</b> and operator. Each amalgamation occurred when the demand for a particular type of work diminished sufficiently to justify joining similar trades. One such absorption occurred in 1935, when the trades blacksmith and welder, and coppersmith and metalworker were abolished and replaced by the trade of metal worker.|$|E

40|$|The hazard of scrotal cancer from cutting oils {{was first}} {{recognized}} in the 1950 s, and led to various control measures including the introduction of solvent refined oils, use of splash guards, provision of protective clothing and washing facilities and education of workers to encourage early detection and treatment of tumours. To assess how effective these controls have been, we have analyzed occupational mortality from scrotal cancer in England and Wales during 1979 - 80 and 1982 - 90. Over this 11 -year period 85 deaths were attributed to the disease in men aged 20 - 74. This represents a reduction in mortality from the 1960 s. Significantly elevated proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were found in press and machine <b>tool</b> <b>setters</b> (PMR 1, 678, five deaths), centre lathe turners (PMR 1, 099, three deaths) and machine tool operators (PMR 303, eight deaths), {{but all of the}} metal machinists who died of scrotal cancer had been born before 1930, and could have worked with cutting oils before controls were introduced. These findings are reassuring, but continued monitoring of scrotal cancer incidence and mortality is required...|$|R

More elaborate designs require more specialized tools such as die cut templates, rubber stamps, craft punches, stencils, inking <b>tools,</b> eyelet <b>setters,</b> heat embossing <b>tools</b> and personal die cut machines.

40|$|Between 1936 and 1976, 344 {{cases of}} scrotal cancer were {{registered}} in the West Midlands Region. There was a considerable {{increase in the number}} of registrations after 1955, the figures remaining high until the 1970 s since when they appear to be falling towards the low level seen in the early years of registration. By the end of December 1981 250 deaths had occurred. The cause of death was known in 226 cases and of these, 97 (42. 9 %) were attributed to cancer of the scrotum, 40 (17. 7 %) to other malignancies, and 89 (39. 4 %) to other causes, scrotal cancer not being mentioned on the death certificate. The mean age at registration was 59. 3 years and at death 66 years. Mean survival was 6. 6 years with a five year survival rate of 51 %. Survival was shorter in men who presented with palpable lymph nodes and greater in those treated with surgery alone. Occupations were known for all but 28 of the cases and of these, 61. 9 % had been exposed to mineral oil and a further 7. 8 % to pitch and tar. Among the occupations with exposure to mineral oil, <b>tool</b> <b>setters</b> and <b>tool</b> fitters accounted for the greatest proportion, 89 men having followed those trades. In 74 cases second primary tumours were registered after the scrotal primary, mostly in the skin and bronchus. There was no relation between the development of second primary tumours and exposure to mineral oil or to pitch and tar...|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} part of the 4CV's success was due to the new methodologies used in its manufacture, pioneered by Pierre Bézier. Bézier had begun his 42-year tenure at Renault as a <b>tool</b> <b>setter,</b> moving up to tool designer and then becoming head of the Tool Design Office. As Director of Production Engineering in 1949, he designed the transfer lines (or transfer machines) producing most of the mechanical parts for the 4CV. The transfer machines were high-performance work tools designed to machine engine blocks. While imprisoned during World War II, Bézier developed and improved on the automatic machine principle, introduced before the war by General Motors (GM). The new transfer station with multiple workstations and electromagnetic heads (antecedents to robots), enabled different operations on a single part to be consecutively performed by transferring the part from one station to another.|$|E
40|$|This thesis mainly {{focuses on}} the study and {{application}} of the integration of Computer numerical control (CNC) machining and on-machine cutting tool measurement. According to the industry survey, in current aerospace industry, the usage of off-line tool setters {{is one of the}} most prevailing ways for cutting tools measurement. The following up manual tool data input is required so that the CNC machine will know the tool dimension and finish the assigned machining tasks. Off-line tool setters are often of high accuracy and the measurement results are reliable. However, due to its off-line characteristic, after the tool is used, its current dimension status cannot be known or updated. Thus the quality of the upcoming machined parts cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, the involvement of operators’ manual data input in the traditional method inevitably introduces human error to machining from time to time. To improve the process of part machining and eventually achieve produced parts that are within tolerance, a new approach is proposed in this thesis on the integration of machining and on-line tool measurement. The idea is to perform tool measurement without unloading the tool from the CNC machine, and update the tool dimension data in the machine control before the tool is used to machine the part. The key to this approach is the employment of a laser <b>tool</b> <b>setter,</b> an optoelectronic device that has the ability to communicate with the CNC control. Analysis on kinematics of this new type of device is conducted and its method of communication with CNC machine control is described. Special software on CNC machine control level must be utilized to achieve the objective of on-machine measurement. Custom macros features of FANUC controls is used to suit the needs of parametric programming. The discussions on custom macros feature are carried out in this thesis. With the measurement method established, measurement uncertainty of the system will be discussed in depth. Considering the special attributes of the laser <b>tool</b> <b>setter,</b> the tool geometry and the machine control, an optimized measurement strategy is studied and proposed. Finally, experiments are carried out to verify the accuracy and repeatability of the measurement system. Application on rejecting out-of-tolerance tool being used in machining is also discussed. The result of applications shows the measurement system is suitable for industry use. ...|$|E
