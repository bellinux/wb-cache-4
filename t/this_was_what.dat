5|$|Although the {{watertight}} bulkheads extended {{well above}} the water line, they were not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling {{across the top of}} an ice cube tray. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> happened to Titanic, which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No.6 boiler room, a total of five compartments. Titanic was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, but it could remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open to the ocean. With five compartments, the tops of the bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.|$|E
5|$|Back in Arendelle, Anna (who has {{woken up}} from the spell) tried to track down a device known as a wishing star, which will {{have the power to}} bring her and Kristoff to {{wherever}} Elsa is. It was apparently the necklace Elsa had given Anna long ago, Elsa using it to bring Anna and Kristoff to Storybrooke. However, the Spell of Shattered Sight had already begun, and the only ones immune to it were Elsa, Emma, and Anna (Anna because it was already used on her a while ago). Tracking down a note written by Elsa and Anna's mother right before her death, the three bring it to Ingrid. It reads that Gerda forgave Ingrid for all that had transpired and still loved her, Ingrid realizing <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> the prophecy meant by regaining her sister's love. Realizing {{there is no point in}} killing the town now, the Snow Queen kills herself using the mirror, which deactivates the curse, though a bit of it remained in Storybrooke, reinstating the town line, making it impossible to return to town if you are to leave it.|$|E
5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E

5|$|Hulagu died in 1265, and was {{succeeded by}} Abaqa (1234–1282), who further pursued Western cooperation. Though a Buddhist, upon his {{succession}} he married Maria Palaiologina, an Orthodox Christian and the illegitimate {{daughter of the}} Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos. Abaqa corresponded with Pope Clement IV through 1267 and 1268, sending envoys to both Clement and King James I of Aragon. In a 1268 message to Clement, Abaqa promised to send troops to aid the Christians. It is unclear if <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> led to James's unsuccessful expedition to Acre in 1269. James initiated a small crusade, but a storm descended on his fleet as they attempted their crossing, forcing most of the ships to turn back. The crusade was ultimately handled by James's two sons Fernando Sanchez and Pedro Fernandez, who arrived in Acre in December 1269. Abaqa, despite his earlier promises of assistance, {{was in the process}} of facing another threat, an invasion in Khorasan by Mongols from Turkestan, and so could only commit a small force for the Holy Land, which did little but brandish the threat of an invasion along the Syrian frontier in October 1269. He raided as far as Harim and Afamiyaa in October, but retreated as soon as Baibars' forces advanced.|$|E
5|$|Raven and NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zybysko were {{involved}} in a rivalry heading into Final Resolution. At Bound for Glory, Raven requested an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match but was denied by Zybysko. This led to Raven assaulting him before being ejected from the arena by security in the storyline. At Genesis, Zybysko offered Raven the chance to be released from his contract, as <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> Zybysko wanted in the storyline. Raven declined the offer and tried to attack Zybysko once again. Instead, Zybysko forced Raven to face P.J. Polaco in a match, which Raven won. This led to Turning Point where Raven once again declined an offer to be released. Zybysko then revealed Chris K as Raven's opponent for the night; Raven was victorious in the encounter. On the December17, 2005 episode of Impact!, Zybysko announced that at Final Resolution Raven would have another opponent and if he won the bout then he gained a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match.|$|E

Despite his contract stipulating that IAHA was to pay all his personal legal expenses, {{on top of his}} $100,000 annual salary, the Association refused initially to pay the legal bills. It was claimed that Brown created the legal defense fund on the advice of IAHA's own legal counsel.|$|E
25|$|Tea was {{introduced}} from China to Europe in the 17th century, but, as a luxury item, was not transported in significant quantities until the 19th century. China {{was the main}} centre of production {{until late in the}} 19th century. The British East India Company's monopoly of the tea trade from China to Britain ceased in 1834. This opening to competition meant that faster ships were needed, as merchants vied to be first in the market with each new crop of tea. Unlike the slower East Indiamen that had carried tea during that company's monopoly, the tea clippers were designed for speed. Those that had achieved particularly fast passages could usually command a higher freight (the price paid to transport the cargo) than others. Tea wholesalers would mention in advertisements which ship had carried the different batches being sold. It was often the case that tea that was loaded early in China was of somewhat poorer quality than that which became available a few weeks later in the season. Yet <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> was carried by the first ships home and sold to the public with the cachet of a fast passage.|$|E
