5|$|Despite its slow {{metabolism}} rate, the Sunda slow loris has a high-energy diet. Its slow lifestyle {{may be due}} to {{the energy}} costs of detoxifying certain secondary plant compounds in many genera of food plants their diets. The largest amount of <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>spent</b> eating phloem sap (34.9%), floral nectar and nectar-producing plant parts (31.7%), and fruits (22.5%). It also consumes gums and arthropods such as spiders and insects. Gum is taken by licking wounds on trees. They are also known to feed on molluscs, including the giant land snail Achatina fulica, and birds' eggs.|$|E
5|$|One major {{distinguishing}} feature between all loris species is locomotion: the Sunda slow loris moves slowly through trees {{on all four}} limbs, typically with three limbs attached to a support at a time. Its movement {{has been described as}} unique; similar to crawling, or as if it was climbing in every direction, the Sunda slow loris changes direction or moves between branches with little noise or change in speed. In captivity, about a quarter of its <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>spent</b> moving quadrupedally, a quarter suspended or hanging, a quarter climbing, and a quarter clasping multiple branches (bridging). It may hang below a branch by one or both feet for long periods of time.|$|E
5|$|The willie wagtail {{is almost}} always on the move and rarely still {{for more than a}} few moments during {{daylight}} hours. Even while perching it will flick its tail from side to side, twisting about looking for prey. Birds are mostly encountered singly or in pairs, although they may gather in small flocks. Unlike other fantails, much of its <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>spent</b> on the ground. It beats its wings deeply in flight, interspersed with a swift flying dip. It characteristically wags its tail upon landing after a short dipping flight.|$|E
50|$|Although {{considerable}} <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>spent</b> {{building and}} maintaining the fort, {{the majority of the}} <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>spent</b> defending and patrolling the frontier. Capt. Adna Chaffee fought the Comanche in a successful engagement in March 1868. Companies F, I, K, and L of the Sixth Cavalry were augmented when Lt. Col. S.B. Hayman's 17th Infantry arrived on 3 June 1868.|$|R

5|$|Four magical {{disciplines}} are acquired, {{including the}} Fire of Ares, the Ice of Poseidon, the Lightning of Zeus, and the Soul of Hades, which, {{depending on the}} magic equipped, imbues the Blades of Chaos with that elemental property. For example, the Soul of Hades imbues the Blades with purple flames and can unleash souls of the Underworld to briefly attack enemies. The Ice of Poseidon also enables Kratos to breathe underwater, a necessary ability as substantial <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>spent</b> there. The Rage ability called Rage of the Gods that was featured in previous games is included, but in this game, its meter is filled by landing attacks on enemies and the ability is automatically activated once the meter has reached maximum capacity. It remains activated until Kratos is attacked or stops attacking {{for an extended period}} of time, after which the meter must be refilled. The Rage ability is also affected by the magic equipped, allowing Kratos to use different Rage attacks, such as the lightning-based Rage of Zeus.|$|E
5|$|Mario is {{the main}} {{character}} of The Thousand-Year Door, although the game will frequently cut to Princess Peach in the X-Naut Fortress. Much <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>spent</b> on her interaction with the computer TEC, which has suffered from a glitch and has {{fallen in love with}} Peach, much to her surprise. The main antagonist of the Mario series, Bowser, tries to collect the Crystal Stars before Mario does instead of directly opposing Mario, though his attempts mostly become comedic relief. Luigi's role in the game consists of recounting his slapstick adventures in the Waffle Kingdom, and appears with party members of his own, many of whom do not like Luigi at all for unrelated reasons, juxtaposing the universal respect Mario's partners have for Mario.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the golden-crowned sifaka {{consists}} {{of a wide variety}} of plants—as many as 80species—whose availability varies based on the season. It is a seed predator, making seeds a year-round staple in its diet when available. The golden-crowned sifaka also eats unripe fruits, flowers, and leaves. One study showed a diet composition of 37%unripe fruit and seeds, 22%immature leaves, 17%mature leaves, 13%flowers, and 9%fruit pulp. Individuals have also been observed consuming tree bark during the dry season. In general, approximately 60% of its diet {{consists of}} unripe fruits and seed, mainly from leguminous pods, and less than 50% consists of leaves. At Daraina, it has been observed feeding on the sakoa tree (Poupartia caffra) and on mango trees. Immature leaves and flowers are eaten when available, in the early wet season. Daily traveling distance tends to increase when immature leaves are available. Studies have also shown that when food distribution is patchy, feeding times are shorter and more <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>spent</b> traveling. Dietary diversity has been shown to be consistent between populations, suggesting that it is important for the lemur to get a varied mix of nutrients and to protect itself from high levels of specific plant toxins.|$|E

25|$|Caterpillars re-emerge {{in early}} spring. When it is warm, they feed a little, {{but most of}} the <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>spent</b> basking in the sun. There are six instars in total.

25|$|Initially, {{graduate}} students usually rotate through the laboratories of several faculty researchers, {{after which the}} student commits to joining a particular laboratory {{for the remainder of}} his or her education. The remaining <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>spent</b> conducting original research {{under the direction of the}} principal investigator to complete and publish a dissertation. Unlike undergraduate and professional schools, there is no set time period for graduate education. Students graduate once a thesis project of significant scope to justify the writing of their dissertation has been completed, a point that is determined by the student's principal investigator as well as his or her faculty advisory committee. The average time to graduation can vary between institutions, but most programs average around 5–6 years.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{caterpillar}} {{is fully}} grown, {{it leaves the}} larval stage and enters the pupal stage of development. The fully grown caterpillar forms a chrysalis after securing itself to a surface which is generally a lupine stem or leaf. It sheds its outer skin, revealing the chrysalid. This stage lasts about 10 days while the adult butterfly develops within the chrysalid. The butterfly can be sighted as early as late March in the summit of San Bruno Mountain or the Twin Peaks. They persist well into June when they can be seen perched on a lupine plant or feeding on coastal buckwheat flowers. Day to day for the adult butterfly is mostly spent foraging for nectar, flying, mating, and for the females, laying eggs. Nearly equal <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>spent</b> between perching, feeding, and flying. The adult Mission blue lives about a week; during this time, the females lay the eggs on the host plants. The complete Mission blue butterfly life cycle lasts one year.|$|E
25|$|McDevitt {{describes}} human civilization at {{the time}} of the back-story as spread across many worlds, most of which were independent of the others. All maintained sentimental ties with Earth, but difficulties of interstellar travel and local parochialism ensured that there was no central government. Many human worlds maintained their own armed forces but again there was no central direction. Communication between worlds was limited to travel by interstellar ships, which used magnetic drives for short and medium distance travel within star systems and Armstrong interstellar drives by means of which ships could travel between star systems through “Armstrong space”. Both {{at the time}} of the back-story and in the protagonist's time, navigation using Armstrong drives is sufficiently imprecise that ships must for safety reasons emerge from Armstrong space well away from stars and planets and travel substantial distances (and times) using magnetic drives. In addition, and partly as a result, travel through Armstrong space is time-consuming – as described in the novel, a voyage of 3,000 light years takes about seven months, of which about five months <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>spent</b> in Armstrong space. It is important to the story that some individuals, like Alex Benedict and most Ashiyyur, react physically badly to the transitions into and out of Armstrong space.|$|E

25|$|The drug {{causes a}} delay in the onset, and {{decrease}} in the duration of REM sleep. Following discontinuation of the drug, REM sleep rebound {{has been reported in}} some studies. Nitrazepam is reported to significantly affect stages of sleep - a decrease in stage 1, 3, and 4 sleep and an increase in stage 2. In young volunteers, the pharmacological properties of nitrazepam were found to produce sedation and impaired psychomotor performance and standing steadiness. EEG tests showed decreased alpha activity and increased the beta activity, according to blood plasma levels of nitrazepam. Performance was significantly impaired 13 hours after dosing with nitrazepam, as were decision-making skills. EEG tests show more drowsiness and light sleep 18 hours after nitrazepam intake, more so than amylobarbitone. Fast activity was recorded via EEG 18 hours after nitrazepam dosing. An animal study demonstrated that nitrazepam induces a drowsy pattern of spontaneous EEG including high-voltage slow waves and spindle bursts increase in the cortex and amygdala, while the hippocampal theta rhythm is desynchronized. Also low-voltage fast waves occur particularly in the cortical EEG. The EEG arousal response to auditory stimulation and to electric stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation, posterior hypothalamus and centromedian thalamus is significantly suppressed. The photic driving response elicited by a flash light in the visual cortex is also suppressed by nitrazepam. Estazolam was found to be more potent however. Nitrazepam increases the slow wave light sleep (SWLS) in a dose-dependent manner whilst suppressing deep sleep stages. Less <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>spent</b> in stages 3 and 4 which are the deep sleep stages, when benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam are used. Benzodiazepines are therefore not good hypnotics in the treatment of insomnia. The suppression of deep sleep stages by benzodiazepines may be especially problematic to the elderly as they naturally spend less time in the deep sleep stage.|$|E
500|$|A {{shift in}} {{location}} in the sequel reflected {{some of the changes}} in the world since then: while the New York Stock Exchange and its trading floor had featured heavily in the first film, they are less prominent in the second. Instead, more <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>spent</b> at the Federal Reserve Building, reflecting its new position as a [...] "bulwark of the system" [...] according to Stone. The location provided a link to the contemporary crisis the film examines, since September 2008 it has been an important site for meeting on the crisis.|$|E
