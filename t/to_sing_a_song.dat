500|$|The soundtrack {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Singer Charulatha Mani wrote for The Hindu on [...] "Nalandhana" [...] that, [...] "...one {{can feel the}} proximity in musicality. The Thavil beats, Nadaswara refrains and the honeyed voice all blend into an inviting melody composed by K.V. Mahadevan." [...] For [...] "Maraindhirundhu" [...] she said, [...] "The nadaswaram and thavil back-ups for this song and the jathi-s give it its typical classical flavour. 'Thooyane mayavaa mayane velava ennai aalum Shanmuga vaa'– these lines represent the ideal confluence of raga, bhava and lyric, a perfect foil to each other." [...] Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen in their Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, referred to [...] "Nalandhana" [...] as [...] " [...] major song hit".

500|$|Following {{the events}} of [...] "The Bells of Saint John", in which he {{encountered}} a third version of Clara, the Doctor decides {{to learn more about}} his new companion and travels into her past to observe her. He finds that her parents met by a chance encounter caused by a gust of wind blowing a leaf into her father's face and discovers that her mother died while Clara was a teenager. The Doctor goes back to the present and collects Clara, then takes her to the Rings of Akhaten, where they observe a series of planetoids orbiting a planet, with a shining pyramid on one of them. The Doctor takes Clara to a giant alien marketplace and introduces her to several aliens, including a merchant named Dor'een who attempts to rent them a space bike. The market does not use hard currency but rather trades in items of sentimental value; this appalls Clara, who believes sentimental items should be cherished and not given away. She becomes separated from the Doctor and encounters a little girl (Emilia Jones) who appears to be running and hiding. Clara catches up to her and she explains that her name is Merry Galel, the Queen of Years. Merry tells Clara that she is hiding because she is supposed <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> at a ceremony and she is afraid to get it wrong. Clara reassures her by telling her what her mother once said, and Merry heads to the ceremony.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics {{and contributed to}} the film's success. Film historian and columnist Randor Guy approved of the music, considering [...] "Ninaipadhellam" [...] to have [...] "excellent background orchestration". Film critic Baradwaj Rangan, writing for The New Indian Express, opined that [...] "Engirundhaalum Vaazhga" [...] had set [...] "the precedent for several generations of jilted lovers". On [...] "Sonnathu Neethaana", singer Charulatha Mani wrote, [...] "The subtle pathos that P. Susheela imparts when she sings 'sol sol..en uyire' is notable." [...] P. K. Ajith Kumar of The Hindu stated, [...] "Just as [...] does not need to know the language <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> perfectly, we need not know Tamil to enjoy her songs like ... Sonnathu neethanaa... Nenjil Oru Aalayam [...] )". Rajadhyaksha and Willemen called [...] "Engirundhaalum Vaazhga" [...] "a classic number about unrequited love." [...] Following Viswanathan's death in July 2015, the news agency, Press Trust of India wrote that [...] "Ninaipadhellam" [...] was [...] "memorable for the deep sense of solace it offered to wounded hearts." [...] Anand Venkateswaran of The Wire noted, [...] "MSV’s style is less about making words sit in a meter than about a musical empathy with the meaning. Could anyone else have set to tune the first line of ‘Sonnadhu nee daana‘, of Nenjil Or Alayam (Muthuraman, 1962)?" [...] A critic from Dina Thanthi noted Kannadasan had an uncanny ability to deliver perfect situational songs and cited [...] "Sonnathu Neethaana" [...] as an example.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} South African [...] "Freedom Songs" [...] had musical origins in makwaya, or choir music, which {{combined}} elements of Christian hymns with traditional South African musical forms. The songs were often short and repetitive, using a [...] "call-and-response" [...] structure. The music was primarily in indigenous languages such as Xhosa or Zulu, {{as well as}} in English. Melodies used in these songs were often very straightforward. Songs in the movement portrayed basic symbols that were important in South Africa—re-purposing them to represent their message of resistance to apartheid. This trend had begun decades previously when South African jazz musicians had added African elements to jazz music adapted from the United States in the 1940s and 1950s. Voëlvry musicians used rock and roll music to represent traditional Afrikaans songs and symbols. Groups affiliated with the Black Consciousness movement also began incorporating traditional material into their music: the jazz-fusion group Malombo, for example, used traditional rhythms of the Venda people to communicate pride in African culture, often with music that was not explicitly political. While musicians such as Makeba, performing outside South Africa, felt an obligation to write political lyrics, musicians within the country often held that there was no divide between revolutionary music and, for instance, love songs, because the struggle of living a normal life was also a political one. Vusi Mahlasela would write in 1991: [...] "So who are they who say no more love poems now? I want <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> of love for that woman who jumped fences pregnant and still gave birth to a healthy child." ...|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack {{received}} {{positive response}} from critics; {{all the songs}} were successful, especially [...] "Engey Nimmadhi". Film historian Randor Guy stated, [...] "The movie has excellent music (Viswanathan-Ramamurthy; lyrics by Kannadasan) and many songs became hits— Paartha Gnaabakam Illayo...!, Unnai ondru ketpen (...) and Engey nimmathee (T. M. Soundararajan)." [...] Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu said, [...] "Who can forget the everlasting flavour of MSV’s expertise that emanated through each and every number, beginning with ‘Unnai Ondru Kaetpaen’!" [...] Film critic Baradwaj Rangan called it a [...] "stylish musical bonanza". According to singer Charulatha Mani, [...] "Unnai Ondru Ketpen" [...] {{was based on the}} Harikambhoji raaga and further wrote, [...] "In the phrase, ‘Ennai Pada Sonnal’, the notes SRGR,S S,N set the mood for the raga." [...] whilst also calling the song a [...] "super-hit piece". Music director and singer Ramesh Vinayakam said [...] "Engey Nimmadhi" [...] was an example of [...] "the unconscious yet natural and healthy fusion that was happening to cinema music at the hands of music directors." [...] The Hindu included [...] "Engey Nimmadhi" [...] in its list, [...] "Immortal songs of TMS". P. K. Ajith Kumar of The Hindu stated, [...] "Just as [...] does not need to know the language <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> perfectly, we need not know Tamil to enjoy her songs like ... Chittukkuruvi... Puthiya Paravai [...] )". The Times of India noted, [...] "Think any of Sivaji Ganesan's songs and you'll immediately think of the film. Be it the seductive club song Partha Nyabagam Illayo (Pudhiya Paravai)... the songs in his films were perfectly in sync with the sequence." ...|$|E
500|$|Austin in turn penned [...] "Creep" [...] {{and thought}} she would be its perfect lead. He wrote the song while {{cruising}} in a Chevrolet Blazer and {{wanted it to be}} written from a female perspective. This experience was said to create [...] "a new mold" [...] of songwriting for him, as he was [...] "talking about stuff guys didn't know girls did." [...] The [...] "female point-of-view" [...] on the track was something the trio appreciated because as a group they have always portrayed themselves as feminists, the song goes along with that mentality. But still, on the 2013 VH1 biopic , the track also appeared to have been also inspired by Austin's infidelity to then-girlfriend, member Rozonda [...] "Chilli" [...] Thomas. Latoya Peterson of Spin observed that feminism was being loudly maligned in music {{at the time of the}} song's release, as a result, more female artists like TLC, Salt-N-Pepa and Tori Amos began to [...] "overtly defend themselves." [...] When asked if they were getting inspired from Radiohead's 1992 track with the same name, the group denied this. Andy Greene from Rolling Stone had pointed out that the group took the term [...] "" [...] in a different direction compared to Radiohead's or Stone Temple Pilots' 1993 single's, in which the trio's song is about getting revenge on a cheating guy by having an affair. The idea, however, was considered to be quite [...] "controversial." [...] According to Thomas, the theme didn't come as much of a shock for them, she stated: [...] "I think when we first came out, it was very bold of us to have a song called 'Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg' with [...] 'Two inches or a yard, rock hard or if it's sagging'. People totally understood what type of group we were. <b>To</b> <b>sing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> like 'Creep' wouldn't be surprising from us." ...|$|E
