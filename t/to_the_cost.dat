5|$|A {{radioisotope}} building, a steam plant, {{and other}} structures were added in April 1946 {{to support the}} laboratory's peacetime educational and research missions.

5|$|Despite these {{economic}} indicators, the Budget presented in August 1974 saw large increases in spending, especially in education. Treasury officials had advised {{a series of}} tax and fee increases, ranging from excise taxes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of posting a letter; their advice was mostly rejected by Cabinet. The Budget was unsuccessful {{in dealing with the}} inflation and unemployment, and Whitlam introduced large tax cuts in November.

Many residents in the neighborhoods under the tram's route object to the tram's presence. The cost increases themselves, and the perceived machinations of public officials, have been controversial. Some consider the project an unworthy use of public funds at any price, either {{due to a lack}} of benefit for those not associated with OHSU, or due to opposition to such projects in general.|$|E

Marchington's time with the Flying Scotsman was documented in a documentary, the Channel 4 programme A Steamy Affair: The Story of Flying Scotsman.|$|E

5|$|NASA's {{original}} plan for safely de-orbiting Hubble was {{to retrieve it}} using a space shuttle. Hubble would then have most likely been displayed in the Smithsonian Institution. This {{is no longer possible}} since the space shuttle fleet has been retired, and would have been unlikely in any case due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the mission and risk to the crew. Instead, NASA considered adding an external propulsion module to allow controlled re-entry. Ultimately NASA installed the Soft Capture and Rendezvous System, to enable deorbit by either a crewed or robotic mission.|$|E
5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax used goods, the value would be {{determined}} by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The price differential/margins between used and new goods would stay consistent, as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> and value of the new goods. Because the U.S. tax system has a hidden effect on prices, it is expected that moving to the FairTax would decrease production costs from the removal of business taxes and compliance costs, which is predicted to offset a portion of the FairTax effect on prices.|$|E
5|$|The IOC {{awarded the}} 1960 Olympics to Squaw Valley, United States. Since the village had no facilities, {{there was a}} rush to {{construct}} infrastructure and sports facilities including an ice arena, speed-skating track, and a ski-jump hill. The opening and closing ceremonies were produced by Walt Disney. The Squaw Valley Olympics was the first winter Olympics to have a dedicated athletes' village, {{the first to use}} a computer (courtesy of IBM) to tabulate results, and the first to feature female speed skating events. The bobsleigh events were absent for the only time due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of building a bobsleigh run.|$|E

Following the left-winged Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet's victory in the 2005 parliamentary election, the new Minister of Transport, Liv Signe Navarsete from the Centre Party, announced {{that there would be}} no more public tenders in the railway sector. The government stated that experience from Sweden and the United Kingdom showed that employees rights and safety was reduced after privatization was introduced.|$|E

5|$|A plan {{to upgrade}} the {{waterways}} to allow the use of 300 to 500-tonne boats {{led to the formation}} of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company Limited in November 1888. The cost of the scheme was estimated to be around £1million, in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of acquiring the canals from the railway company. The new company obtained an Act of Parliament on 26 August 1889, creating the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company, which was authorised to raise £1.5million and to purchase the four canals either by negotiation, or by compulsory purchase if negotiations failed. The railway company was unwilling to sell, and it was not until 1895, after protracted negotiation and legal battles that the transfer was agreed. The Navigation Company had only succeeded in raising £625,000, which was less than the purchase price of the canals, and therefore the railway company nominated half of the ten directors, while the Aire and Calder Company declined to buy any shares because of railway influence. Many of the ambitious plans for the modernisation of the system were hindered by a lack of capital, although some further developments took place.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively {{known as}} the Carnary chapel and college, the complex was {{originally}} formed of separate buildings which were later joined together. The entrance porch to the chapel was added between 1446 and 1472 during the episcopate of Walter Lyhart, Bishop of Norwich. The crypt beneath the chapel {{was used as a}} charnel house administered by the sacristan of the cathedral which stored the bones of people buried in the churches of the city to await resurrection, and the ocular windows of the chapel would allow visitors to view the charnel remains. From 1421 to 1476 the crypt was also the location of the Wodehous chantry, established by Henry V at the request of John Wodehous, a veteran of the Battle of Agincourt. The college was dissolved in 1547 during the English Reformation by the Abolition of Chantries Act before being purchased by the city in 1550, and used by the school shortly after. Until the 19th century the chapel was used as the main classroom, though it was not until 1908 the chapel returned to the role of religious assembly and 1940 when it was consecrated for use as a church, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of refurbishment.|$|E
