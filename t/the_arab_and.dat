5|$|According to the French Byzantinist Henri Grégoire, the Byzantine success {{against the}} Arabs that culminated with the Battle of Lalakaon {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} one of the oldest surviving acritic (heroic) poems: the Song of Armouris. Grégoire claimed that the eponymous protagonist, the young Byzantine warrior Armouris, was actually inspired by Emperor Michael III. A battle from the Byzantine heroic cycle around Digenis Akritas also strongly recalls the events of Lalakaon, as the eponymous hero surrounds an Arab army near Malakopeia. Strong influences can be found in episodes in <b>the</b> <b>Arab,</b> <b>and</b> later Turkish, epic cycles around Battal Ghazi, as well as an episode in the One Thousand and One Nights.|$|E
5|$|Hamdan was {{defeated}} in 895 and imprisoned with his relatives, but his son Husayn ibn Hamdan managed to secure the family's future. He raised troops for the Caliph among the Taghlib in exchange for tax remissions, and established a commanding influence in the Jazira by acting as a mediator between the Abbasid authorities and <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Kurdish population. It was this strong local base which allowed the family to survive its often strained relationship with the central Abbasid government in Baghdad during the early 10th century. Husayn was a successful general, distinguishing himself against the Kharijites and the Tulunids, but was disgraced after supporting the failed usurpation of Ibn al-Mu'tazz in 908. His younger brother Ibrahim was governor of Diyar Rabi'a (the province around Nasibin) in 919 and {{after his death in}} the next year he was succeeded by another brother, Dawud. Sayf al-Dawla's father Abdallah served as emir (governor) of Mosul in 905/6–913/4, was repeatedly disgraced and rehabilitated, until re-assuming control of Mosul in 925/6. Enjoying firm relations with the powerful Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, he later played {{a leading role in the}} short-lived usurpation of al-Qahir against al-Muqtadir in 929, and was killed during its suppression.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} author to discuss Philip <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Christianity is Eusebius, {{who served as}} bishop of Caesarea in Roman Palestine from ca. 314 to his death in 339. Eusebius' major work is the Historia Ecclesiastica, written in several editions dating from ca. 300 to 325. The Historia is not an attempt at a full history of the Church in the classical style, but rather a collection of facts addressing six topics in Christian history from the Apostolic times to the late 3rd century: (1) lists of bishops of major sees; (2) Christian teachers and their writings; (3) heresies; (4) the tribulations of the Jews; (5) the persecutions of Christians by pagan authorities; and (6) the martyrs. His Vita Constantini, written between Constantine's death in 337 and Eusebius' own death in 339, {{is a combination of}} eulogistic encomium and continuation of the Historia (the two separate documents were combined and distributed by Eusebius' successor in the see of Caesarea, Acacius).|$|E

5|$|Under {{the more}} {{aggressive}} Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r.723–743), the Arab raids became more large-scale affairs and {{were led by}} some of the Caliphate's most capable generals, including princes of the Umayyad dynasty, such as Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik or Hisham's own sons Mu'awiyah, Maslama and Sulayman. Gradually, however, the Muslim successes became fewer, especially as their resources were drawn into the mounting conflict with the Khazars in the Caucasus. The raids continued, but <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Byzantine chroniclers mention fewer successful captures of forts or towns. Nevertheless, in 737 a major victory over the Khazars allowed the Arabs to shift their focus and intensify their campaigns against Byzantium. Thus in 738 and 739 Maslamah ibn Hisham led successful raids, including the capture of the town of Ancyra. For the year 740, Hisham assembled the largest expedition of his reign, placing it under his son Sulayman.|$|E
5|$|European {{influence}} in Mangalore {{can be traced}} back to 1498, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed at St Mary's Islands near Mangalore. In the 16th century, the Portuguese came to acquire substantial commercial interests in Canara. Krishnadevaraya (1509–1529), the then ruler of the Vijaynagara empire maintained friendly relations with the Portuguese. The Portuguese trade was gradually gathering momentum and they were striving to destroy <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> Moplah trade along the coast. In 1524, when Vasco da Gama heard that the Muslim merchants of Calicut had agents at Mangalore and Basrur, he ordered the rivers to be blockaded. In 1526, the Portuguese under the viceroyship of Lopo Vaz de Sampaio took possession of Mangalore. The coastal trade passed out of Muslim hands into Portuguese hands. In 1550, the Vijayanagara ruler, Sadashiva Raya, entrusted the work of administering the coastal region of Canara to Sadashiv Nayaka of Keladi. By 1554, he was able to establish political authority over South Canara. The disintegration of the Vijaynagara Empire in 1565 gave the rulers of Keladi greater power in dealing with the coastal Canara region. They continued the Vijayanagara administrative system. The two provinces of Mangalore and Barkur continued to exist. The governor of Mangalore also acted as the governor of the Keladi army in his province. In 1695, the town was torched by Arabs in retaliation to Portuguese restrictions on Arab trade.|$|E
