Dorothy has fled the island {{in the night and}} an {{envelope}} is <b>tacked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front door with Hermie's name on it. Inside is a note from Dorothy, saying she hopes he understands she must go back home as there is much to do. She assures Hermie she will never forget him, and he will find his way of remembering what happened that night. Her note closes with the hope that Hermie may be spared the senseless tragedies of life.|$|E

25|$|Sleeves were bell- or trumpet-shaped, {{and caught}} {{up at the}} elbow to show the frilled or lace-trimmed sleeves of the shift (chemise) beneath. Sleeves became {{narrower}} as the period progressed, with a frill at the elbow, and elaborate separate ruffles called engageantes were <b>tacked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shift sleeves, in a fashion that would persist into the 1770s.|$|E

50|$|In {{the colonial}} era, Coral Bay was {{the hub of}} {{economic}} activity on the island. Its natural port offered protection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sailing ships of the day. In addition, {{it was an easy}} sail by smaller boats, with minimal <b>tacking,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearby British Virgin Islands. Until the late 20th century, the residents of Coral Bay and East End had easier and more frequent access to Tortola than did those of either Cruz Bay or St. Thomas.|$|R

The landing gear was made from steel tubes with hickory wood inserts. Control cables were routed through copper tubing. It had a left foot controlled throttle and a right foot controlled magneto kill switch.|$|E
25|$|However, as crinolines {{started to}} develop in fashion, sleeves turned to be like large bells which gave the dress a heavier volume. Engageantes, which were usually made of lace, linen, or lawn, with cambric and broderie anglaise, were worn under the sleeves. They were easy to remove, launder and {{restitch}} into position, so to act as false sleeves, which was <b>tacked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> elbow-length sleeves during the time. They commonly appear under the bell-shaped sleeves of day dresses.|$|E

Ludo Bagman {{used to be the}} Head of Department here, but his gambling problem forced him to flee from Goblin creditors. The department is located on the seventh level of the Ministry of Magic, and includes the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official Gobstones Club, and the Ludicrous Patents Office– other sports and games-related aspects of the Harry Potter world.|$|E
50|$|Because the clewlines, and {{especially}} the buntlines, do not pass through the axis on which the yard pivots, their effective length will change as the yard is rotated round the mast from one <b>tack</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other. When the sail is set, the lines can be left with plenty of slack to allow for this; if the sail is currently in its gear (see yardarm) then it might be necessary <b>to</b> tend <b>the</b> lines as the yards are braced round.|$|R

500|$|The sod {{house was}} not without its disadvantages, however. [...] Initially, at least, most had dirt floors, {{which had to be}} {{sprinkled}} with water to abate dust. [...] To protect against invasion by rodents, insects, and snakes, the interior walls were often shaved smooth and plastered with lime, or with a mixture of local clay and sand or ashes; the lower portions of the exterior walls could also be reinforced, with planks or concrete if they were available, or with a second layer of sod to thicken them. [...] Leaky roofs were also a problem; to protect the inhabitants and the interior furnishings from falling water, dirt, and vermin, it was common to make a ceiling of a white muslin sheet <b>tacked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> walls. [...] Since windows were {{one of the most expensive}} elements of a sod house, pioneers on a budget were often forced to make do with windows that were small and few in number; a light muslin ceiling and plastered walls helped to illuminate the house by reflecting daylight through the interior.|$|E
2500|$|Close-fitting sleeves {{just past}} the elbow were trimmed with frills or ruffles, and {{separate}} under-ruffles called engageantes of lace or fine linen were <b>tacked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> smock or chemise sleeves. The neckline was trimmed with a fabric or lace ruffle, or a neckerchief called a fichu could be tucked into the low neckline.

40|$|The Momentum {{movement}} and the rise in Labour membership are, Jeremy Corbyn’s supporters argue, proof that the party is returning to its roots and embracing ordinary people’s concerns. But political scientists tend to be sceptical about intra-party democracy, because party members are usually more radical than the average voter. Fabio Wolkenstein says claims that Labour has reconnected with its “working-class core” are problematic, not least because the working class do not necessarily <b>tack</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left – and indeed many have been attracted to Ukip...|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the people}} who {{attempted}} the test explored other creative, but less efficient, methods <b>to</b> achieve <b>the</b> goal. For example, some tried <b>to</b> <b>tack</b> <b>the</b> candle <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall without using the thumbtack box, and others attempted to melt some of the candle’s wax and use it as an adhesive <b>to</b> stick <b>the</b> candle <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall. Neither method works. However, if the task is presented with <b>the</b> <b>tacks</b> piled next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> box (rather than inside it), virtually all of the participants were shown <b>to</b> achieve <b>the</b> optimal solution, which is self defined.|$|R
2500|$|In 1865, {{the first}} notice of Abraham Lincoln's death was posted on a {{buttonwood}} tree {{in front of}} the home of Jeremiah Shuttleworth, today the Dedham Historical Society.

2500|$|The span of {{the main}} wing, which was set at an angle for {{incidence}} of 8°, was 31ft., with a wingtip extension of [...] on each wing, providing a constant wingspan of 33ft. 6 in. (10.21 m). The wing was 6ft. (1.8 m) wide; the extensible wingtips were 4ft. 2 in. (1,27 m) wide, each providing a maximum of 10.5 sq. ft. (0.98 sq.m.) wing area. The wing extensions were of the same curvature as the main wing. “The main supporting plane at a 5-deg. dihedral angle consists of two main beams across which are placed spruce ribs. The surface is made of Baldwin vulcanized silk, of jet black color, <b>tacked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the ribs and laced to the frame.

2500|$|Hanák {{followed}} {{it with the}} still admired feature-length documentary Pictures of the Old World (Obrazy starého sveta, 1972), partly a meditation on what lies hidden beneath the concept of [...] "an authentic life", a theme already addressed in 322. Although Hanák was treated with suspicion by the more repressive communist authorities that took over after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, he found an early refuge in a topic sufficiently removed from big politics to survive {{on the margins of}} official production and yet, executed with a finesse that gave it a wide international appeal. In the most extraordinary section, an old man talks with great fascination and lucidity about space travel, recalling how two astronauts walked on the moon and collected rocks while a third circled in their spaceship. <b>Tacked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall of his crumbling shack is a small photograph of men walking on the moon. It is a beautiful, elegiac work whose images could apply to Appalachia or any other poor region.|$|E

2500|$|In 1964 he {{was offered}} a post at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, on the {{understanding}} that he would create a constructivist book. Roth wanted to make something three-dimensional instead, and was promptly fired.

He then held a party inviting the students to remove anything they liked; the college rescinded its offer to publish the book, which ended up as Snow, finally printed in 1970. He moved on to Rhode Island School of Design at the beginning of 1965, where his tenure involved teaching at the School of Graphic Design, employing his principle of [...] "non-teaching as teaching". This involved sitting by himself working, refusing to tell his students anything. He also used these students to typeset and print his first book of poetry Scheisse. Neue Gedichte von Dieter Rot (Shit. New Poems by Dieter Rot) 1966. Since the students were unable to speak German, Roth incorporated all their typographical errors into the book.|$|E

At 16:30, Beresford's squadron sighted Willaumez's fleet, <b>tacking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southeast. Willaumez ordered his second-in-command, Contre-amiral Antoine Louis de Gourdon to drive Beresford away and Gourdoun brought four ships around <b>to</b> chase <b>the</b> British squadron, with the remainder of the French fleet following more distantly.
