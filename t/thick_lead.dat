50|$|Originally {{designated}} C-135B-II, {{project name}} Lisa Ann, the RC-135E Rivet Amber was a one-of-a-kind aircraft {{equipped with a}} large 7 MW Hughes Aircraft phased-array radar system. Originally delivered as a C-135B, 62-4137 operated from Shemya Air Force Station, Alaska from 1966 to 1969. Its operations were performed {{in concert with the}} RC-135S Rivet Ball aircraft (see below). The radar system alone weighed over 35,000 pounds and cost over US$35 million (1960 dollars), making Rivet Amber both the heaviest C-135-derivative aircraft flying and the most expensive Air Force aircraft for its time. The radiation generated by the radar was sufficient to be a health hazard to the crew, and both ends of the radar compartment were shielded by <b>thick</b> <b>lead</b> bulkheads. This prevented the forward and aft crew areas from having direct contact after boarding the aircraft. The system could track an object the size of a soccer ball from a distance of 300 mi, and its mission was to monitor Soviet ballistic missile testing in the reentry phase. The power requirement for the phased array radar was enormous, necessitating an additional power supply. This took the form of a podded Lycoming T55-L5 turboshaft engine in a pod under the left inboard wing section, driving a 350kVA generator dedicated to powering mission equipment. On the opposite wing in the same location was a podded heat exchanger to permit cooling of the massive electronic components on board the aircraft. This configuration has led to the mistaken impression that the aircraft had six engines. On June 5, 1969, Rivet Amber was lost at sea on a ferry flight from Shemya to Eielson AFB for maintenance, and no trace of the aircraft or its crew was ever found.|$|E
5000|$|Recorded {{in several}} forms {{including}} Yaxley, and the dialectal derivations Yoakley, Yockley, and Yokley, Yaxley is an English surname. It is locational and derives {{either from the}} two villages called Yaxley in the English counties of Cambridgeshire (formerly Huntingdonshire) and Suffolk or from some now [...] "lost" [...] medieval village of a similar origin. Over three thousand British Isles surnames are known to originate from lost villages, so whilst unusual, such an event is {{not by any means}} unique. The Cambridgeshire village is recorded in the Saxon Codex Diplomaticus of 963AD as [...] "Geaceslea", and later as [...] "Iacheslei" [...] in the Domesday Book of 1086, whilst Yaxley in Suffolk appears as [...] "Jacheslea" [...] in the Domesday Book. Both places share the same meaning and derivation, which is [...] "Cuckoo wood". Locational surnames were generally [...] "from" [...] names; the easiest way to identify a stranger, being to call him or sometimes her, by the name of the place from whence they came, even though that may just be the next village. Spelling being at best erratic and local accents very <b>thick,</b> <b>lead</b> to the development of [...] "sounds like" [...] names. In this case the surname lists of the diocese of Greater London suggest that the derivatives from Yaxley occurred during the 17th century. Early examples of the recordings include the marriage of Symon Yaxley and Elizabeth Croply at Soham, Cambridgeshire, on May 10, 1594, Margaret Yoakley who married James Hird at St Katherines by the Tower (of London), on December 29, 1656, and Thomas Yockley, who married Sarah Pocock at St James church, Dukes Place, city of London, on May 9, 1689. The first recorded spelling of the family name is possibly that of Elizabeth Yaxley. This was dated 1543, when she married Thomas Sherman, at Yaxley, in Suffolk, during the reign of King Henry VIII of England, 1509 - 1547.|$|E

With this redefinition, the ampere can be realised by controlled transfer of individual electrons at a constant frequency. This provides a direct frequency-to-current conversion. One promising candidate for a new current standard is the SINIS turnstile, which consists of a small normal metal island that is connected to two superconducting leads via insulating barriers. A major problem for these types of devices is the existence of nonequilibrium quasiparticles, which are generated during operation of the device. These quasiparticles may tunnel through the insulating barriers causing excess current. In {{order to reduce the}} number of quasiparticles in the vicinity of the junctions, the geometry of the leads must be optimised. The quasiparticle density can be significantly reduced by designing the leads in such a way that the quasiparticles may effectively diffuse away from the tunnel junction. In this work, we have studied a simple diffusion model for quasiparticle transport and fabricated SINIS turnstiles with varying lead thicknesses. In this work, we have fabricated devices where the normal metal island is either Cu or AlMn. The Mn suppresses the superconducting properties of Al, resulting in a normal metal island that can be oxidised in order to fabricate tunnel junctions for devices with very <b>thick</b> superconducting <b>leads.</b> We were able to demonstrate that AlMn based devices can be indeed fabricated and that their charging energy can exceed the superconducting gap, which is essential in order to suppress several error mechanisms.
