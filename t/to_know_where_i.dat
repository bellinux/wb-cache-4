6000|$|... "Well, you needn't {{be worried}} anybody'll be lookin' for me, 'cause there's nobody wants <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am. So go ahead, if I've been doin' {{anything}} you perfessors don't like." ...|$|E
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "Then these passionate {{expressions}} are unprovoked, and my duty is clear. I must lose {{no time in}} destroying Mr. Welling. Do {{you happen}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> laid my revolver?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I have no receipt--ugh, ugh! Nothing <b>to</b> show--don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> stand--ought <b>to</b> have a guardeean--ugh, ugh! Don't know anything. Ugh, ugh!" ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{a minute}} {{she failed to}} speak, but at last she answered: [...] "It wasn't to talk about that.

6000|$|... "I'm sorry, {{but this}} is April 1st, and I'll wait no longer. I'm ready to send some of my boys up for early exams, and I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> stand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ''Tis a {{delightful}} middle mind to be in. I know it, for I was like it once; but I had scarcely {{been so long}} enough <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was before I was gone past.' ...|$|E
60|$|St. Auban muttered an oath, Vilmorin stifled a cry, whilst he who had {{so loudly}} called <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> hid myself--a frail little fellow, in the uniform of the gardes du corps--now stood silent and abashed.|$|E
5000|$|Eric Kripke says: [...] "I {{definitely}} like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> it's going. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what Season 1 is. I have {{a really}} solid idea about what Season 2 is, and I'm starting to think about notions for Season 3, knock on wood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am much {{obliged to}} you for your kind {{advocacy}} of my cause when it most needed an advocate,' said the young man, laughing, and drawing a card from his pocket. 'Perhaps you'll do me the favour <b>to</b> let me <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> can thank you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{they were}} a mighty hard-looking crowd. They {{came up to the}} claim and wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he was. <b>I</b> told them that he was gone to Europe and that <b>I</b> did not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> find him. They meant him no good--it was easy to see that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They know better," [...] {{answered}} Mrs Keswick, with a grim smile. [...] "I {{went away}} once before, and Uncle Isham hunted me up, {{and he got}} a lesson that he'll never forget. When I want them <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am, I'll tell them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I {{will send}} {{for my mother}} directly. But I will stay here, with Mrs. Pettifer, till {{something}} has been done. I want no one <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am, except you. You will come again, will you not? you will not leave me to myself?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{book-keeper}} {{drafted the}} statement, because I thought you ought <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> stand," [...] he said.

60|$|He {{must have}} seen some threat implied, though I meant none. He was my very humble servant at once, and {{declared}} he had called only <b>to</b> let me <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> stood. Then he bowed himself out, wishing me luck with the horse he had heard of, and I lighted my pipe with his accompt.|$|R

"What puzzles {{me about}} her," [...] Bathurst said, [...] "is that I seemed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> her face. <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> saw her, {{and under what}} circumstances, I have been puzzling myself half the evening to recall, but I have the strongest {{conviction}} that I have met her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} Miss Gresham should not marry Mr Moffat. I think so because {{her family is}} high and noble, and because he is low and ignoble. When one has an opinion on such matters, one cannot but apply it to things and people around one; and having applied my opinion to her, the next step {{naturally}} is to apply it to myself. Were I Miss Gresham, I would not marry Mr Moffat though he rolled in gold. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> rank Miss Gresham. What <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> is, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> ought <b>to</b> rank myself?" ...|$|R
60|$|JOHNNY. [coming {{forward into}} the place left vacant by Gunner's visit to the sideboard] Well, now that the gentleman has been {{attended}} to, I should {{like to know where}} we are. It may be a vulgar business habit; but I confess I like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm in luck's way here,' {{he said to}} himself; 'It's {{not every}} day of the week I see a full table like this. I should like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am, though.' As the wish passed his lips he saw before him a {{beautiful}} little being, who said in a sweet low voice-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't {{get into}} a rage," [...] he said. [...] "If I'm {{willing to put up}} with it, I suppose you needn't cry out. All I meant was that when you tell me a thing is going to cost so much, I like to--well, in fact, I--like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] said Burke, {{springing}} to his feet, [...] "that suits me. I {{would have}} spoken to her before, but I had my doubts about what you'd think of it. But now that I see you're willing to sign the papers, what <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> is, <b>where</b> will <b>I</b> be likely to find Miss Croup?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Eden {{reported}} that Crowhurst's sailing techniques were good, [...] "But I felt his navigation was a mite slapdash. I prefer, {{even in the}} Channel, <b>to</b> <b>know</b> exactly <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am. He didn't take too much bother with it, merely jotting down figures on a few sheets of paper from time to time." [...] After struggling against westerlies and having to tack out into the Channel twice they arrived at 2.30pm on 15 October, where an enthusiastic BBC film crew started filming Eden in the belief he was Crowhurst. There were 16 days to get ready before the race's deadline on 31 October.|$|R
60|$|Instead {{of wanting}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how he was, she desired <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he was! <b>I</b> {{pointed toward the}} back dining-room, which had been made into a bedroom for Philip. He had chosen it himself, {{when he first came}} to stay with us, because the window opened into the garden, and he could slip out and smoke at any hour of the day or night, when he pleased.|$|R
6000|$|Olive Chancellor made no {{rejoinder}} save a low, impatient sigh; she transferred {{her attention}} to the girl, who now held Mrs. Farrinder's hand in both her own, and was pleading with her just to prelude a little. [...] "I want a starting-point--I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am," [...] she said. [...] "Just two or three of your grand old thoughts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hard {{work in the}} museum," [...] said Mr. George; [...] "but I {{have got}} through. To-morrow I mean to rest, and I wish you would take me off to-morrow, somewhere on an excursion. I don't care where it is, {{provided}} I have nothing to think or to say about it. I don't want even <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am going." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And so he will, and it'll {{be a great}} {{temptation to}} me <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> can get it so easily. But {{he was telling me}} all about this woman before I thought of my own concerns--and I didn't like to be talking to him of what I wanted myself, when he'd been asking a favour of me. It would be too much like looking for payment." ...|$|E
60|$|The visitor was in {{the room}} while it was yet turning round with me and before I had the power to stir. If I had had it, I should have hurried away. I had not even the {{presence}} of mind, in my giddiness, to retire to Ada in the window, or to see the window, or <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> it was. <b>I</b> heard my name and found that my guardian was presenting me before I could move to a chair.|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{drove down}} the highway and just before Cann River Les woke up. He wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> we were. <b>I</b> told him we were in Victoria heading to Orbost. Les cracked the shits and was abusing me. He was saying {{he wanted to go}} to Sydney. He kept saying 'the bridge'. I took this to mean he wanted to throw the girls off the bridge because he had spoken about this before. There are some bridges on the way to Sydney on the Hume Highway which have great drops." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me, sir, {{that we are}} in an {{exceedingly}} tight place. Our first difficulty is <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> begin. <b>I</b> never thought this fighting an antediluvian monster would be such a complicated job. This one is a woman, with all a woman's wit, combined with the heartlessness of a cocotte. She has the strength and impregnability of a diplodocus. We may be sure that in the fight that is before us there will be no semblance of fair-play. Also that our unscrupulous opponent will not betray herself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, but I am {{not allowed}} to go off the grounds," [...] said Charlotte firmly, [...] "and I think I'd rather not have any flowers because the matron might want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> got them, {{and then she would}} have this gap closed up. I live in mortal dread for fear it will be closed anyhow. It's very uncomfortable--living in mortal dread." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This lady {{immediately}} began to ask me questions. She had perceived that I was a stranger, and she wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> came from, what was my business, {{and as much as}} I could tell her of myself. 'I knew you were a scholar,' she said, 'because of your book, and I believe in scholars.' Then briefly she told me her story and what she wanted of me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] Hunterleys {{observed}} coolly. [...] "And {{your present}} anxiety is <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> spent the intervening time, and why I am here in Monte Carlo? Frankly, Mr. Draconmeyer, I look upon this close interest in my movements as an impertinence. My travels {{have been of}} no importance, but they concern myself only. I have no confidence to offer respecting them. If I had, {{it would not be}} to you that I should unburden myself." ...|$|E
500|$|According to The New York Times, {{the film}} became a [...] "star vehicle" [...] for Song. The film was about an average, popular Chinese-American {{teenager}} whose life is {{turned upside down}} by a visit from a young Chinese monk (Shin Koyamada). The monk claims she is the reincarnation of a powerful female warrior and {{the only person who}} can prevent an ancient evil spirit from destroying the world. In a second story line, Wendy and most of her family struggle with keeping their culture and heritage. Song felt she could relate to the message since she knew little about her own people before making the film. She said, [...] "I really identified with Wendy because I don't want <b>to</b> not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> came from". <b>To</b> promote the film, she posed for the cover of Seventeen, Teen People, Teen, Seventeen Malaysia, and several other magazines, and traveled to Malaysia, Singapore, and Costa Rica. A Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior sequel, starring Song and Koyamada, was announced in the end of 2007.|$|R
5000|$|On May 23, 2013, it was {{reported}} that Michele had landed a book deal with Random House and Harmony Books to write an autobiography, chronicling her rise from Broadway actress to the star of the Fox comedy-drama series Glee. In the announcement, Michele said, [...] "There wasn't a guidebook when I was growing up, that detailed everything I would need <b>to</b> do, and <b>know,</b> <b>to</b> get <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am today. But I believe I can write one of sorts: not a how-to-make-it-in-show-business book, but a guide to harnessing tenacity, passion, enthusiasm and hard work to make your dreams come true." ...|$|R
40|$|This view of Sandusky, Ohio, {{carriage}} maker George Bing's biplane {{was probably}} {{taken in a}} field near Castalia, Ohio. A "Sandusky Daily Register" reporter quoted Bing as saying, "I don't want anyone <b>to</b> <b>know</b> when or <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am going to give my aeroplane a tryout {{for the simple reason}} that I want to be alone [...] . and will be alone or there'll be no flight [...] Am I sure that my airship will sail in the air?
