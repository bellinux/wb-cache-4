40|$|The {{definition}} of the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> is the travel time of a wave {{to move from the}} hydraulically most distant point in the watershed to the outlet in this research. The theory of the kinematic wave is used to bring out the fact that when the rainfall intensity is varied in time domain, we get the formula of the depth of the water wave and the traveling distance. Under different types of rainfall events simulation, the kinematic wave interprets the hydrologic phenomena with best effect.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is presented for the cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of the anticancer drug doxorubicin. The model assumes sigmoidal, Hill-type dependence of cell survival on drug-induced damage. Experimental evidence indicates distinct intracellular and extracellular mechanisms of doxorubicin cytotoxicity. Drug-induced damage is therefore expressed as {{the sum of}} two terms, representing the peak values over <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> intracellular and extracellular drugs. Dependence of cell kill on peak values <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> rather than on an integral over time is consistent with observations that dose-response curves for doxorubicin converge to a single curve as exposure time is increased. Drug uptake by cells is assumed to include both saturable and unsaturable components, consistent with experimental data. Overall, the model provides better fits to in vitro cytotoxicity data than previous models. It shows how saturation of cellular uptake or binding with concentration can result in plateaus in the dose-response curve at high concentrations and short exposure, as observed experimentally in some cases. The model provides a unified framework for analyzing doxorubicin cellular pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, and can be applied in {{mathematical model}}s for tumor response and treatment optimization...|$|R

40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> {{parameter}} {{is defined}} very loosely {{in literature and}} it is calculated rather subjectively in practice (Akan 1986). The situation becomes adverse as the terrain slope approaches zero; because the slope generally appears in the denominator of any formula for <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration,</b> this time goes to infinity as the slope goes to zero. The variables affecting this time parameter on flat terrains have been studied through plot scale field experiments. It {{has been found that}} the antecedent moisture and rainfall rate control this parameter. Some of the existing <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> methods have been compared, and it is found that all the empirical models compared under predict this time parameter. This under prediction can be attributed first to the differing concepts of <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> previous researchers have modeled, secondly to the absence of any accounting for the initial moisture content in their respective equations and thirdly to the watersheds where these models have been calibrated. At lower time of concentrations, Izzard-based model predictions show some results close to the observed values. A methodology to determine the plot scale surface undulations has been developed to estimate the depression storage.
