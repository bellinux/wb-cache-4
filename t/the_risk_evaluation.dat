Recently, regulatory agencies have used contaminant levels in fish as a benchmark for remedial action on contaminated sites, using human health <b>risk</b> assessment as <b>the</b> justification.

However, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> assessments that provide a basis for remediation consider many different pathways of exposure (not just ingestion), and deal with long-term exposure. <b>The</b> <b>risk</b> <b>evaluations,</b> and recommendations promulgated by those agencies, differ because they have different goals, use different assumptions, and often fail to communicate among agencies. It is suggested that it is valuable to have these different levels of <b>risk</b> <b>evaluations</b> to adequately address health issues.
