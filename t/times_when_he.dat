5|$|According to legend, Varanasi {{was founded}} by the god Shiva. There {{happened}} a fight between the two supreme gods, Brahma and Shiva, and the succeeding combat resulted {{in one of the}} five heads of Brahma being torn off by Shiva. It was a custom of the time that the victor carried the slain adversary’s head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all <b>times.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. The land of Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy religious site.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{threw himself}} into Parliamentary work, begrudging the <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was unable to attend debates and {{spending}} much time on committee work. When Austen Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer in the continued coalition government led by the Liberal Prime Minister, Lloyd George, tried to recruit him to serve on an additional committee, Neville Chamberlain informed his half-brother that he could only serve if it met between midnight and 7:30am. Chamberlain took time to assure {{the future of the}} Birmingham Savings Bank, and Parliament passed an act which removed onerous restrictions from the bank. In March 1920, he was offered a junior post at the Ministry of Health by Bonar Law on behalf of the Prime Minister, but was unwilling to serve under Lloyd George despite Bonar Law's warnings that Chamberlain, now past fifty, might never be offered another chance to serve in government, as Lloyd George was likely to remain premier for a very long time. Chamberlain was offered no further posts during Lloyd George's premiership, and when Bonar Law resigned as party leader, Austen Chamberlain took his place as head of the Unionists in Parliament.|$|E

He became a hypochondriac, developing a fear of hospitals and doctors. Often bedridden as a child, he became an outcast at school and bonded with his mother. At <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was confined to bed, he drew, listened to the radio and collected pictures of movie stars around his bed. Warhol later described this period as very important in the development of his personality, skill-set and preferences. When Warhol was 13, his father died in an accident.|$|E
25|$|Farmer Weaver was a catcher-outfielder for Louisville. I {{tipped his}} bat several <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had two strikes on him one year, {{and each time}} the umpire called him out. He got even, though. One time there were two strikes on him and he swung as the pitch was coming in. But he didn't swing at the ball. He swung right at my wrists. Sometimes I think I can still feel the pain. I'll tell you I didn't tip his bat again. No, sir, not until the last {{game of the season}} and Weaver was at bat for the last time. When he had two strikes, I tipped his bat again and got away with it.|$|E

25|$|Principal {{photography}} {{ended in}} September 2013 after 42 days of shoot. Afolayan {{in an interview}} with Weekend Magazine expressed that it was very stressful shooting October 1 and his previous films were incomparable to it.

He also said there were <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> and the crew had just three hours of sleep in four days, but however pointed out that he had best hands on deck for the project and he is grateful for that. The film production team on set was made up of about a hundred people; Co-ordinator, Oge Ogu noted that one of the major challenges during filming was co-ordinating and managing the extras to fit into the director's vision, as the crowd often span into hundreds of people.|$|E
25|$|At 8:00p.m., Mohamed became {{involved}} in an altercation with another man at 200 South Rio Grande Street in downtown Salt Lake City when officers were called to the scene. According to Salt Lake County prosecutors, Mohamed {{was involved in a}} fight after a failed drug deal and dispute over $1.10 near a homeless shelter. A man had come into the homeless shelter to obtain food, and asked Mohamed for marijuana, but he only had methamphetamine. Mohamed then demanded the man's money. Mohamed was holding a metal broomstick at the time, and had used it to hit the other man at least once. Responding officers asked Mohamed to drop the broomstick at least ten <b>times.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> did not drop the broomstick and appeared to try to hit the man again, he was shot four times by officers Kory Checketts and Jordan Winegar. Mohamed's family disputed the claim, and his cousin, Muslima Weledi, said that witnesses told her Mohamed was armed with a wooden broomstick. The man battered with the broomstick received welts and bruises. Abdullahi was left in critical condition.|$|E

25|$|Harry is Edna’s {{husband and}} Tobias’s best friend. At {{one point in}} the past, Harry and Tobias, coincidentally, had an extramarital affair with the same young woman. Besides both having been {{businessmen}} and meeting at the same club, it is unclear what else Harry and Tobias have in common except that they have known one another {{for a long time and}} neither sleeps with his wife. Harry is something of a reflection of Tobias, but he is even more reserved. Of all the characters in this play, Harry speaks the least. And when he does speak, he is a man of few words with lots of pauses around each one. He prefers to talk around things rather than going at them straight on. He also avoids questions, as when Agnes tries to find out why he and his wife have come to their home. Instead of giving Agnes an answer, he compliments the furnishings in Agnes’s home. He also has the tendency to repeat himself; at one point he repeats the same line four <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> tries to explain how fear has driven his wife and him out of their home. It is Harry, in the end, who tells Tobias that he and Edna have decided to leave. Although Harry prompted the discussion with Edna about resolving the issue of staying at their friends’ house, it is implied that Edna made the decision and that Harry just delivered the message.|$|E
