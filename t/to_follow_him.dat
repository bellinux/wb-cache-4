5|$|The {{group who}} {{had watched the}} {{departure}} of the trains {{from the top of the}} chimney near the Liverpool tunnel, meanwhile, had been forgotten in the confusion, and were unable to get down from their vantage point. Eventually at around 8.00pm John Harrison, a teacher of gymnastics and swordsmanship, lowered himself down the rope hand-over-hand, and coaxed the others <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> down in the same manner. The angry group then set out in search of the worker who had been supposed to bring them down.|$|E

Troude {{found that the}} tide was too low to sail at once, and so sent a squadron of three frigates ahead, {{under the command of}} Commodore Pierre Roch Jurien. These frigates were the 40-gun Italienne, Calypso and Cybèle, which sailed together on the evening of 23 February southwards in the direction of Belle Île.

5|$|Henry rode to Winchester, {{where an}} {{argument}} ensued {{as to who}} now had the best claim to the throne. William of Breteuil championed the rights of Robert, who was still abroad, returning from the Crusade, and to whom Henry and the barons had given homage in previous years. Henry argued that, unlike Robert, {{he had been born}} to a reigning king and queen, thereby giving him a claim under the right of porphyrogeniture. Tempers flared, but Henry, supported by Henry de Beaumont and Robert of Meulan, held sway and persuaded the barons <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>him.</b> He occupied Winchester Castle and seized the royal treasury.|$|E

5|$|Merrick was {{becoming}} a greater financial burden on his family and eventually, his father secured him a hawker's licence which enabled him to earn money selling items from the haberdashery shop, door to door.

Housewives refused to open doors for him and now people not only stared at him but began <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> out of curiosity. Merrick failed to make enough money as a hawker to support himself. On returning home one day in 1877, he was severely beaten by his father and he left home for good.|$|E

Dwight (Rainn Wilson), Andy (Ed Helms), Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) and Stanley (Leslie David Baker) are upset because most of those clients were ones Michael previously stole from them. They are also upset that Michael treats Pam and Ryan with more respect {{because they were the}} only people <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> to his new company, with Michael believing his company operates within the branch despite the buyout. Dwight calls a secret meeting in the warehouse with the salespeople, minus Pam and Ryan, to think of a way to get their clients back.|$|E
5|$|Prior to filming, Clarkson's {{contract}} was not renewed by the BBC {{after he was}} involved in an altercation with a Top Gear producer in March 2015, leaving Hammond, May, and Wilman <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> in departing the show following the end of the series.

5|$|The {{situation}} was now precarious and violence appeared likely as the rebels prepared to unleash a volley of arrows. Richard rode forwards towards {{the crowd and}} persuaded them <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> away from Smithfields, to Clerkenwell Fields, defusing the situation. Walworth meanwhile began {{to regain control of}} the situation, backed by reinforcements from the city.

Richard promptly knighted Walworth and his leading supporters for their services.|$|E
