5|$|That summer, Victoria and Albert spent a rainy {{holiday in}} the west of Scotland at Loch Laggan, but heard from <b>their</b> <b>doctor,</b> Sir James Clark, that his son had enjoyed dry, sunny days farther east at Balmoral Castle. The tenant of Balmoral, Sir Robert Gordon, died {{suddenly}} in early October, and Albert began negotiations {{to take over the}} lease from the owner, the Earl Fife. In May the following year, Albert leased Balmoral, which he had never visited, and in September 1848 he, his wife and the older children went there for the first time. They came to relish the privacy it afforded.|$|E

25|$|Blavatsky {{was born}} as Helena Petrovna von Hahn in the Ukrainian town of Yekaterinoslav, then {{part of the}} Russian Empire. Her birth date was 12 August 1831, {{although}} according to the Julian calendar used in 19th-century Russia it was 31 July. Immediately after her birth, she was baptized into the Russian Orthodox Church. At the time, Yekaterinoslav was undergoing a cholera epidemic, and her mother contracted the disease shortly after childbirth; despite the expectations of <b>their</b> <b>doctor,</b> both mother and child survived the epidemic.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} a fairly limited side effect profile for honokiol and {{it appears to be}} fairly well tolerated. However, its {{antithrombotic}} effects could cause hemorrhage especially in patients with conditions that would put them at a higher risk like hemophilia or Von Willebrand disease. Additionally, patients already taking anticoagulants should talk to <b>their</b> <b>doctor</b> before taking honokiol supplements. Honokiol is also neurotoxic at high concentrations. In a 2002 study, researchers induced cell death in fetal rat cortical neurons by directly applying 100μM in vitro.|$|E

25|$|On Sam's 21st birthday, {{his parents}} behave very strangely, and Sam himself sees hellish visions and {{experiences}} odd events. His father eventually claims that many years ago, {{he was very}} sick, and in return for restoring his health, {{he and his wife}} promised their firstborn child to the Devil (Ray Wise). Although the couple intended to cheat the Devil by not having children, this plan went awry when Satan persuaded <b>their</b> <b>doctor</b> to lie and tell the couple that they could not conceive in exchange for wiping his gambling debts clean. Sam was born shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Long-term use and {{benzodiazepine}} dependence is {{a serious}} problem in the elderly. Failure to treat benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can cause serious medical complications. The elderly have less cognitive reserve and are more sensitive to the short (e.g., in between dose withdrawal) and protracted withdrawal effects of benzodiazepines, as well as the side-effects both from short-term and long-term use. This can lead to excessive contact with <b>their</b> <b>doctor.</b> Research has found that withdrawing elderly people from benzodiazepines leads to a significant reduction in doctor visits per year, it is presumed, due to an elimination of drug side-effects and withdrawal effects.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, BBCi, the {{interactive}} media {{arm of the}} corporation, who had scored successes with <b>their</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who webcasts (beginning with the aforementioned Death Comes to Time, which was followed by Real Time in 2002 and a re-make of the uncompleted Shada in 2003), decided on a more ambitious project to celebrate the programme's upcoming 40th anniversary. In July 2003, BBCi announced the production of Scream of the Shalka, a fully animated adventure adapted for webcasting with Richard E. Grant as the Doctor and Sir Derek Jacobi as the Master. As there were no concrete plans for producing a new series, BBCi announced Shalka as the official continuation of the programme, and that Grant was the official Ninth Doctor. However, events were soon to overtake that.|$|E

Using data from the 1998, 2002, and 2006 General Social Surveys—nationally representative samples—and ordinary least squares regression, this study reexamines this issue. It was expected that blacks {{are less likely to}} trust <b>their</b> <b>doctors</b> than whites either before or after controlling for other predictors of trust {{and that there was no}} significant change in this relationship over the time period under study. The results indicate that blacks were less likely to trust <b>their</b> <b>doctors</b> than whites only in 2002, but not in 1998 and 2006. This finding suggests that, even with the same source of data, empirical support for the claim about the less trust of blacks in doctors than whites is less robust than conventional belief, and it calls for additional, careful reexamination...|$|R
25|$|TNF is {{a protein}} that is {{released}} by activated white blood cells, triggering more inflammation, an immune system response and {{more damage to}} the mucosa of the colon because of the immune activation. Certain drugs inhibit TNF, hence reducing inflammation and immune system involvement. Infliximab {{was approved by the}} FDA for treating ulcerative colitis in March 2005. It is usually given as an intravenous infusions at weeks 0,2 and 6 and then every eight weeks thereafter. It is very useful for inducing and maintaining a remission of ulcerative colitis. Infliximab works better when used in combination with immunmodulators such as 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine, but a corresponding increase in adverse events means that the decision to use one drug or two must be based on an individualized discussion between the patient and <b>their</b> <b>doctor.</b>|$|E
25|$|Scallon {{was born}} in Frederica Street, Islington, North London, to Robert and Sheila Brown (née Sheerin). Her father worked as a porter at nearby King's Cross station.

She was five when her parents were advised by <b>their</b> <b>doctor</b> to return to Derry because of the London smog, and the harmful effect it had on some of their children. (London had not yet benefited from the Clean Air Act 1956.)

25|$|Darwin {{returned}} from Malvern {{at the end}} of June 1850 to a reawakening of his fears that his illness might be hereditary. His bright nine-year-old daughter Anne who had become a particular favourite and comfort to him fell sick. She was miserable for weeks on end, then became feverish. <b>Their</b> <b>doctor</b> could do nothing and thought it might be inherited. She had recovered to some extent by March 1851, but then she and her father were both laid low by influenza. Darwin recovered but Annie was still ill, and on 24 March he took her to Malvern, leaving her there for the best treatment he knew of, and returning to Downe where Emma had stayed as she was pregnant. With his first paper on barnacles printed and Hooker safely returned to Britain laden with specimens, things were looking up, but then on 15 April Annie suffered a serious relapse and Darwin had to rush to her side.|$|E

500|$|Druitt was a favoured {{suspect in}} the Jack the Ripper crimes {{throughout}} the 1960s, until the advent of theories in the 1970s that the murders were not {{the work of a}} single serial killer but the result of a conspiracy involving the British royal family and Freemasonry. These theories, widely condemned as ridiculous, implicate Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, his tutor James Stephen, and <b>their</b> <b>doctor</b> Sir William Gull to varying degrees. One version of the conspiracy promoted by Stephen Knight in his 1976 book [...] supposed that Druitt was a scapegoat, chosen by officialdom to take the blame for the murders. Martin Howells and Keith Skinner followed the same line in their 1987 book The Ripper Legacy, which was panned by one critic as being based on [...] "no evidence whatever".|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of broadcast, there were some {{complaints}} {{about the level of}} violence portrayed.

Scenes objected to included the depictions of war and Nyder hitting the Doctor. However, David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker, in <b>their</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who: The Television Companion (1998), recorded a positive reaction from fans in regards to creativity and Davros, though one writer noted the ending did not satisfyingly close the story. The BBC's Audience Research Report concluded, [...] "A little more complex than some Doctor Who adventures, perhaps, and with underlying questions of conscience, the serial had been 'different' it was occasionally felt and, although dismissed in some quarters as far-fetched, long drawn-out, confused and/or predictable, had provided acceptable escapist entertainment for the majority." [...] Howe and Walker themselves described the serial as [...] "well-written and full of new ideas, while still remaining true to the Daleks' roots by effectively equating them with the Nazis", and particularly praised the production values, pacing, and moral dilemma. However, they noted a few minor flaws, namely Harry being attacked by a giant clam, dull cliffhangers, and [...] "many of the scientist characters serve no other purpose than to act as Dalek-fodder".|$|E
