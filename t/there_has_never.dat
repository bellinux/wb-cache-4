5|$|As ancient as {{this music}} is, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been {{substantial}} data recorded regarding the kulintang’s origins.

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been {{a railway}} to Mersea Island. During the railway mania of the mid-19th century, goods were transported by boat and barge. In 1911, local {{businessmen}} proposed a railway between Colchester and the island, {{which would have}} ended at a pier next to the Esplanade in the south, with an additional station in West Mersea on what is now East Road. The plans were abandoned due to the First World War.|$|E
5|$|After 100 years, an {{estimated}} 500,000 students have taken {{courses at the}} Extension School. Fees were kept {{as low as possible}} to allow as many as possible to enroll, only 0.18% have ever earned a degree. Including certificate earners, 2.5% have graduated. Today more degrees are awarded each year than were awarded in the first 50 years combined. While <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been a formal entrance exam such as the SAT, non-native English speakers must provide designated proof of English proficiency or receive a minimum score on the TOEFL, IELTS, or PTEA. Additionally, the preadmission Expository Writing E-25 course requires students to complete E-15 with a grade of B or higher in EXPO 15 or successfully complete the Test of Critical Reading and Writing Skills.|$|E

Legal scholar Viet D. Dinh, of Vietnamese descent, was named as a potential George W. Bush nominee.

5|$|The other {{significant}} theory {{about the origin}} of the legend, proposed by Robert Chambers in 1864, is that a genuine child was born in the early 17th century with facial deformities resembling a pig's face and a speech impediment causing her to grunt. The science of teratology (the study of birth defects and physiological abnormalities) was then in its infancy, and the theory of maternal impression (that the thoughts of a pregnant woman could influence the future appearance of her children) was widely accepted. It is possible that the birth of a genuinely deformed child led to the story of the beggar as a possible explanation for her appearance, with other elements of the story being later additions or distortions by publishers. Chambers speculates that the original child may have had a similar appearance to Julia Pastrana, a woman with hypertrichosis and distorted (although not pig-like) facial features, who was widely exhibited in Europe and North America until her death in 1860, and then, embalmed, until the 1970s. However, while a 1952 stillbirth with a face resembling a pig is documented, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been a reliably documented case of a human with deformities of this kind surviving outside the womb, while all versions of the pig-faced woman legend describe her as a healthy adult.|$|E
