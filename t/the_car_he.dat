Having secured one top-ten finish in the season's first four Chase for the Nextel Cup races, Earnhardt stated he need to secure a top-five finishing position, and was determined to get his team more involved in the championship battle.

Gee angrily confronts Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) and Colonel Granger (Gerald F.

Barnfather and Granger insist the removal work is safe, but give in when Gee threatens {{to go to the}} media. Meanwhile, Lewis (Clark Johnson) brags repeatedly to Crosetti (Jon Polito) about his new Ford FE V8 engine and <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>he</b> plans to build.

40|$|Introduction Centering is a {{model of}} the conversants' center of {{attention}} in discourse that is concerned with the relationship of attentional state, inferential complexity and the form of referring expressions. Centering models discourse processing factors that explain the difference in the perceived coherence of discourses such as (1) and (2) from (Hudson-D'Zmura, 1988) : (1) a. Jeff helped Dick wash <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> b. <b>He</b> washed <b>the</b> windows as Dick waxed <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> c. <b>He</b> soaped a pane. (2) a.
