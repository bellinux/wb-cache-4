It shows how interconnect scaling requirements for deep sub-micron (DSM) technologies cause increasing <b>thermal</b> <b>effects.</b> The paper then examines the impact of <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> on both interconnect design and electromigration (EM) reliability. Specifically, it discusses the impact of <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> on the allowable current density limits. Furthermore, it also discusses how thermal and reliability constrained current density limits may conflict with those obtained through purely performance based criterion. Additionally, high-current interconnect design rules for ESD and I/O circuits are also examined. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Thermal {{analysis}} {{has long been}} essential for designing reli-able, high-performance, cost-effective integrated circuits (ICs). Increasing power densities are making this problem more important. Characterizing the thermal profile of an IC quickly enough to allow feedback on the <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> of tentative design changes is a daunting problem, and its complexity is increasing. The move to nanoscale fabrication processes is increasing the importance of quantum thermal phenomena such as ballistic phonon transport. Accurate thermal analysis of nanoscale ICs containing {{hundreds of millions of}} devices requires characterization of <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> on length scales that vary by several orders of magnitude, from nanoscale quantum <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> to centimeter-scale cooling package impact. Existing chip–package thermal analysis methods based on classical Fourier heat transfer cannot capture nanoscale quantum <b>thermal</b> <b>effects.</b> However, accurate device-level modeling techniques, such as molecular dynamics methods, are far too slow for use in full-chip I...|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} program implements a numerical model of <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> of cavitation in cryogenic fluids. The model and program were developed {{for use in}} designing and predicting the performances of turbopumps for cryogenic fluids. Prior numerical models {{used for this purpose}} do not account for either the variability of properties of cryogenic fluids or the <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> (especially, evaporative cooling) involved in cavitation. It is important to account for both because in a cryogenic fluid, the <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> of cavitation are substantial, and the cavitation characteristics are altered by coupling between the variable fluid properties and the phase changes involved in cavitation. The present model accounts for both <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> and variability of properties by incorporating a generalized representation of the properties of cryogenic fluids into a generalized compressible-fluid formulation for a cavitating pump. The model has been extensively validated for liquid nitrogen and liquid hydrogen. Using the available data on the properties of these fluids, the model has been shown to predict accurate temperature-depression values...|$|R

40|$|Transcranial {{magnetic}} stimulation (TMS) {{has proven}} to be an invaluable tool both in clinical practice and basic brain research. However, many concomitant effects of TMS are still incompletely understood, including <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> induced by TMS. The present study investigated how <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> induced by magnetic stimulation influence the properties of the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) of hippocampal CA 1 pyramidal neurons. We have demonstrated that a 50 -Hz low-frequency electromagnetic field with intensities of 7, 14, and 23 mT can induce thermal heating in artificial cerebrospinal fluid(aCSF) from 25 to 40 °C over a period of 15 min. We also report that the <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> induced by TMS directly influence the properties of sEPSC in hippocampal CA 1 pyramidal neurons. Double measures were taken to control the temperature across experiments in order to ensure the accuracy of the temperature measurement of the aCSF.

40|$|All {{the stages}} of phase transformations in materials, nucleation, growth, and coarsening, are subject to <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> that stem from the {{redistribution}} {{of energy in the}} system, like release of latent heat, and heat conduction. The <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> change the rate and outcome of the transformation and may result in the appearance of unusual states or phases, in particular in nanosystems. This review will cover the attempts of researchers to build a comprehensive theory of <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> in different phase transformations. Although the dynamical Ginzburg–Landau (continuum) approach will be used for the analysis of the effects, they are robust and conceivably independent of the theoretical method employed. On general physical grounds a possibility of an oscillatory regime in nucleation is considered and evolution equations for the interfacial motion are derived. The equations show that there are two distinctly different sets of <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> of interface motion: one set originates from the existence of the Gibbs–Duhem thermodynamic force on the interface, which has opposite directions compared to the velocity of the interface in the cases of continuous and discontinuous transitions, resulting in a heat trapping effect for the latter and a drag effect for the former. The other set of <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> stems from the existence of the surface internal energy and the necessity to carry it over together with the moving interface. As a result, temperature double layers accompany moving domain boundaries after a continuous transition or the surface creation and dissipation effect appear after a discontinuous one. An unusual, novel phase that may appear in isolated nanosystems (adiabatic nanophase) is described.
