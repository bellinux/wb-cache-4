5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} hammer striking mechanism and a <b>trigger</b> <b>mechanism</b> with a three-position rotary dial fire control selector, {{located at the}} foot of the trigger. The dial has three settings: S– safe, 1– semi-automatic fire, and A– fully automatic fire. When set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the trigger back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and pulling the trigger fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} {{advances}} and new designs in gunpowder weapons during {{the beginning of}} the dynasty, but by the mid to late Ming the Chinese began to frequently employ European-style artillery and firearms. The Huolongjing, compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen sometime before the latter's death on 16 May 1375 (with a preface added by Jiao in 1412), featured many types of cutting-edge gunpowder weaponry for the time. This includes hollow, gunpowder-filled exploding cannonballs, land mines that used a complex <b>trigger</b> <b>mechanism</b> of falling weights, pins, and a steel wheellock to ignite the train of fuses, naval mines, fin-mounted winged rockets for aerodynamic control, multistage rockets propelled by booster rockets before igniting a swarm of smaller rockets issuing forth {{from the end of the}} missile (shaped like a dragon's head), and hand cannons that had up to ten barrels.|$|E
5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the <b>trigger</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would then have to bend over and pull {{the body of the}} weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of the}} weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E
50|$|For infantry, the {{preferred}} projectile weapon was the crossbow, because shooting one required less training than shooting a bow.

However, crossbow <b>trigger</b> <b>mechanisms</b> reverted to simpler designs during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644 CE), presumably because {{the skill of}} constructing bronze <b>trigger</b> <b>mechanisms</b> was lost during the Mongolian Yuan dynasty (1271-1368 CE). Nonetheless, infantry archery using the bow and arrow still served important functions in training as well as naval battles.|$|R

25|$|More {{advanced}} improvised guns {{can make}} use of parts from other gun-like products. One example is the cap gun.

If the cap gun has a strong enough hammer spring, the existing <b>trigger</b> <b>mechanism</b> can be used as-is; otherwise, rubber bands may be added to increase the power of the hammer.|$|E
25|$|Each <b>trigger</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{has its own}} merits. Historically, {{the first}} type of trigger was the single-action. This is the {{simplest}} mechanism and generally the shortest, lightest, and smoothest pull available. The pull is also consistent from shot to shot so no adjustments in technique are needed for proper accuracy. On a single-action revolver, for which the hammer must be manually cocked prior to firing, an added level of safety is present. On a semi-automatic, the hammer will be cocked and made ready to fire {{by the process of}} chambering a round, and as a result an external safety is sometimes employed.|$|E

40|$|Asymmetric loading/unloading {{profiles}} {{during the}} start-up and shut-down operations of {{high pressure high temperature}} pipelines may cause an accumulated axial displacement over several operational cycles known as Pipeline Walking phenomenon. This pipeline walking can {{be triggered by}} several factors e. g. the seabed slope, riser tension and thermal transients. Several studies have been carried out in the literature regarding the influence from individual factors; nevertheless, very little has been made in the evaluation of coupled <b>triggering</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> common for a pipeline segment. This paper investigates the pipeline walking phenomenon using finite element modelling and analysis software SAGE Profile 3 D versus standard analytical formulae. The keys aims are (i) to study the interaction and coupling between the walking <b>triggering</b> <b>mechanisms</b> by comparing coupled and uncoupled analyses, and (ii) to compare the obtained numerical results with analytical predictions, commonly used in the subsea industry. Depending on the pipeline and soil properties, the effect of <b>triggering</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is parametrically investigated with varying pipeline tension and seabed slope for a specific thermal gradient profile. It is found that the common approach to sum up the individual walking rate by the uncoupled analysis for a combination of any two <b>triggering</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> underestimates the walking phenomenon when compared with the coupled analysis. This highlights how attention must be paid to the interaction mechanism. In addition, this study emphasizes that the analytical models severely overestimate the pipeline walking phenomenon, especially when more than one <b>triggering</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are present...|$|R

25|$|In the U.S. the {{traditional}} single-action revolver still reigned supreme {{until the late}} 19th century. In Europe, however, arms makers were quick to adopt the double-action trigger. While the US was producing weapons like the Model 1873, the Europeans were building double-action models like the French MAS Modèle 1873 and the somewhat later British Enfield Mk I and II revolvers (Britain relied on cartridge conversions of the earlier Beaumont–Adams double-action prior to this). Colt's first attempt at a double action revolver {{to compete with the}} European manufacturers was the Colt Model 1877, which earned lasting notoriety for its overly complex, expensive and fragile <b>trigger</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which in addition to failing frequently, also had a terrible trigger pull unless given the attentions of a competent gunsmith.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Contender is {{now known}} as the generation one (G1) Contender and was replaced by the G2 Contender in 1998. The new design is dimensionally the same as the original Contender, but uses an Encore-style trigger group. Due to the changes in the <b>trigger</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and to differences in the angle of the grip relative to the boreline of the gun, the buttstocks and pistol grips are different between the G1 and G2 Contenders and will not interchange. The G2 uses essentially the same barrels and fore-ends as the original Contender and barrels will interchange, with the only two exceptions being the G2 muzzleloading barrels, which will only fit the G2 frame, and the Herrett barrels/fore-ends, which are specific for use only on a G1 frame.|$|E

25|$|Despite the Omni's lack of success, it {{was used}} as the point of {{departure}} for the military M-82 design. While the appearance of the pistol remained the same, the mechanism was completely changed and numerous features copied from the Beretta M-92 including the locking mechanism, the <b>trigger</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the number of rounds (15) in the magazine. However, the open-topped slide of the Beretta was rejected in favour of a traditional closed slide with ejection port. An extractor-mounted loaded chamber indicator, reversible magazine release and ambidextrous safety levers were also included. Military models had a magazine safety, but this could be removed on request for commercial customers. The M-82 began production in 1986 and was adopted by the Spanish forces in 1987 as Modelo M-82 Doble Accion. Commercial models experience difficulties feeding some brands of hollowpoint ammunition, and unsurprisingly, best reliability is achieved with NATO specification ball ammunition.|$|E

Notwithstanding their similar consequences, such phenomena can be characterised by different first and post-failure mechanisms, in relation with regional, seasonal and local features, <b>triggering</b> factors and <b>mechanisms,</b> soil properties, boundary conditions and so on. The present paper analyses the first-failure stage of landslides triggered by rainfall, focusing the attention on Southern Italy, where a large area is covered by pyroclastic soils originated by different volcanic apparata. On {{the basis of the}} avail-able data set, the landslides intensity, frequency and consequences proved to be strictly related to the geological setting, where the <b>triggering</b> <b>mechanisms</b> result quite different during the hydrological year.

500|$|The column {{typical of}} the genus Stylidium is {{sensitive}} and responds to touch. The change in pressure when a pollinating insect lands on a Stylidium flower causes a physiological change in the column turgor pressure by way of an action potential, sending the column quickly flying toward the insect.

Because the column comprises the fused male and female reproductive organs of the flower, the stamen and stigma take turns in dominating {{the function of the}} columnthe anthers develop first and then are pushed aside by the developing stigma. This delayed development of the stigma prevents self-pollination and ensures that cross pollination will occur between individuals of a population.

500|$|As {{described}} in the Book of the Later Han, {{the frame of the}} seismometer was a domed bronze vessel {{in the shape of a}} wine jar, although it was [...] in diameter and decorated with scenes of mountains and animals. The <b>trigger</b> <b>mechanism</b> was an inverted pendulum (which the Book of the Later Han calls the [...] "central column") that, if disturbed by the ground tremors of earthquakes located near or far away, would swing and strike one of eight mobile arms (representing the eight directions), each with a crank and catch mechanism. The crank and a right angle lever would raise one of eight metal dragon heads located on the exterior, dislodging a metal ball from its mouth that dropped into the mouth of one of eight metal toads below arranged like the points on a compass rose, thus indicating the direction of the earthquake. The Book of the Later Han states that when the ball fell into any one of eight toad mouths, it produced a loud noise which gained the attention of those observing the device. While Wang Zhenduo (王振铎) accepted the idea that Zhang's seismometer had cranks and levers which were disturbed by the inverted pendulum, his contemporary Akitsune Imamura (1870–1948) argued that the inverted pendulum could have had a pin at the top which, upon moving by force of the ground vibrations, would enter one of eight slots and expel the ball by pushing a slider. Since the Book of the Later Han states that the other seven dragon heads would not subsequently release the balls lodged up into their jaws after the first one had dropped, Imamura asserted that the pin of the pendulum would have been locked into the slot it had entered and thus immobilized the instrument until it was reset.|$|E
