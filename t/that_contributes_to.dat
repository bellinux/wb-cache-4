5|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{relation}} {{does not explain}} why the winds are organized into tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere. One factor <b>that</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> {{the creation of a}} concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front. This causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude. At high altitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole. This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic'. The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes, as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.|$|E

25|$|Superoxide is a {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} <b>that</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> cellular oxidative stress and is linked to neuromuscular diseases and aging. NADH dehdyrogenase produces superoxide by transferring one electron from FMNH2 to oxygen (O2). The radical flavin leftover is unstable, and transfers the remaining electron to the iron-sulfur centers. Interestingly, it is the ratio of NADH to NAD+ that determines the rate of superoxide formation.|$|E

25|$|There are six armor slots: helmet, gauntlets, chest, legs, class item, and {{artifact}} (artifacts {{were added}} with The Taken King). Each class has armor specific {{to them with}} exotic armor that complement a character's sub-class. Each piece of armor increases overall defense. Before The Taken King, class items were only cosmetic (such as the Hunter's cloak) {{and did not have}} any stat or defense boosts. With The Taken King update, class items were given defense <b>that</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> players' Light level. Players' Ghost companion was also given defense with The Taken King update <b>that</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> their Light level. In addition to earning gear from loot drops by playing missions and other activities, players can purchase gear from faction vendors. Players can pledge their allegiance to one of three factions — Dead Orbit, Future War Cult, or New Monarchy — and earning enough reputation with a faction allows players to earn and purchase that faction's legendary items. Players also earn reputation with other vendors, such as the Vanguard and Crucible, by doing playlists or bounties for that vendor, which also have their own set of legendary items.|$|E
