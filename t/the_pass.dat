5|$|Other outdoor {{recreation}} opportunities exist at and near <b>the</b> <b>pass.</b> Between <b>the</b> <b>pass</b> and Difficult Campground, 3 miles (4.8km) east of Aspen, {{there are many}} popular rock climbing areas, some with grades up to 5.12 under the Yosemite Decimal System. The Grotto Wall across from Lincoln Gulch campground is a frequent destination. Closer to <b>the</b> <b>pass</b> are Instant Karma Cliff and Putterman's Dome.

They then overran a section of 82mm mortars at the east end of <b>the</b> <b>pass.</b> South of <b>the</b> <b>pass,</b> at dawn, First Lieutenant Houston M. McMurray found that only 15 out of 69 men assigned to his platoon remained with him, a mix of US and ROK troops. The North Koreans attacked this position at dawn. They came through an abandoned opening in the barbed wire perimeter. Throwing grenades and spraying the area with burp gun fire, the North Koreans quickly overran the position. Numerous officers and non-commissioned officers attempted to get the men back into line, but they would not follow these orders. In one instance South Korean troops killed their own company commander when he tried to stop them from escaping.|$|E
5000|$|Native {{inhabitants}} of the Alps were naturally {{the first to use}} <b>the</b> <b>passes.</b> <b>The</b> <b>passes</b> first became known to the outside world when the Romans crossed them to raid or conquer the region beyond. Romans, once having found an [...] "easy" [...] way across the chain, did not trouble to seek for harder and more devious routes. Hence, passes that can be shown as certainly known to them are relatively few in number: they are, in topographical order from west to east, the Col de l'Argentiere, the Col de Montgenèvre, the col du Mont Cenis, the two St Bernard passes (Little St Bernard Pass and Great St. Bernard <b>Pass),</b> <b>the</b> Splügen <b>Pass,</b> <b>the</b> Septimer <b>Pass,</b> <b>the</b> Reschen <b>Pass,</b> <b>the</b> Brenner <b>Pass,</b> <b>the</b> Plöcken <b>Pass,</b> <b>the</b> Pontebba <b>Pass</b> (or Saifnitz <b>Pass),</b> <b>the</b> Radstädter Tauern <b>Pass</b> and <b>the</b> Solkscharte <b>Pass</b> or Sölk Pass.|$|R

50|$|The {{effect of}} <b>the</b> card <b>pass</b> {{is that an}} {{identified}} card is inserted somewhere into a deck.

A <b>pass</b> is achieved by swapping the portion of the deck from the identified card downwards, with the portion of the deck above <b>the</b> identified card. <b>Pass</b> techniques include: <b>the</b> invisible turn-over <b>pass,</b> <b>the</b> Zingone Perfect Table <b>pass,</b> <b>the</b> flesh grip <b>pass,</b> <b>the</b> jog <b>pass,</b> <b>the</b> Braue <b>pass,</b> <b>the</b> Charlier <b>pass,</b> <b>the</b> finger palm <b>pass</b> and <b>the</b> Hermann <b>pass.</b> Simply, a card pass is a secret cut of the deck (not to be confused with a coin pass which is a false transfer of a coin from one hand to the other).|$|R

5|$|Driving through <b>the</b> <b>pass</b> is challenging. Both {{approaches}} require 6% grades due to {{the height}} of <b>the</b> <b>pass,</b> and require navigating hairpin turns with advisory speeds of 10mph (15km/h). Rockfalls, particularly on the approach from Aspen, have narrowed some sections to a single lane 12 feet (4 m) wide with temporary traffic lights. On the Twin Lakes approach, they have resulted in temporary closures. Other vehicles frequently enter the road unexpectedly at the many parking areas for campgrounds and other recreational attractions, and bicyclists make frequent use of Highway 82 as well. Lastly, the weather at <b>the</b> <b>pass</b> can be unpredictable and vary considerably from conditions in either Aspen or Twin Lakes. There may be thunderstorms on otherwise clear days, and snow can occur {{at any time of}} the year. CDOT advises anyone coming to <b>the</b> <b>pass</b> for outdoor recreation to take precautions against the effects of the high altitude and the changeable weather.|$|E
5|$|Famously, {{the much}} smaller Greek army held <b>the</b> <b>pass</b> of Thermopylae against the Persians {{for three days}} before being outflanked by a {{mountain}} path. Much of the Greek army retreated, before the Spartans and Thespians who had continued to block <b>the</b> <b>pass</b> were surrounded and killed. The simultaneous Battle of Artemisium was {{up to that point}} a stalemate; however, when news of Thermopylae reached them, the Allied fleet also retreated, since holding the straits of Artemisium was now a moot point.|$|E
5|$|II Napoleon {{ordered the}} {{assemblage}} of over 5,000 artillery for transport through <b>the</b> <b>pass,</b> {{despite the fact}} that <b>the</b> <b>pass</b> was widely considered to be much too narrow, and the route too volatile and unstable, to allow any form of artillery, light or heavy, to come through.

5|$|It {{is often}} claimed {{that at the}} time, <b>the</b> <b>pass</b> of Thermopylae {{consisted}} of a track along {{the shore of the}} Malian Gulf so narrow that only one chariot could pass through at a time. In fact, as noted below, <b>the</b> <b>pass</b> was 100 metres wide, probably wider than the Greeks could have held against the Persian hordes. Herodotus reports that the Phocians had improved the defenses of <b>the</b> <b>pass</b> by channelling the stream from the hot springs to create a marsh, and it was a causeway across this marsh which was only wide enough for a single chariot to traverse. In a later passage, describing a Gaulish attempt to force <b>the</b> <b>pass,</b> Herodotus describes how the Gauls who fell into the marsh disappeared and were drowned.|$|E

5|$|On July 4, 1879, a {{group from}} Leadville struck gold in the {{uppermost}} Roaring Fork valley below <b>the</b> <b>pass.</b> Four miles (6.4km) to the west, they established a settlement in the upper Roaring Fork Valley that eventually took the name Independence from the holiday on which it was established. <b>The</b> <b>pass,</b> the lake from which the Roaring Fork rises and another nearby mountain all took that name as well. The Twin Lakes and Roaring Fork Toll Company, established to build a road through to the camps in the lower Roaring Fork Valley, improved the original path over <b>the</b> <b>pass</b> sufficiently enough by 1880 that horses {{could be used for}} the trip.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, 1879, the {{settlement}} of Independence was established just west of <b>the</b> <b>pass,</b> taking {{its name from the}} Independence Day holiday, and soon lending it to <b>the</b> <b>pass</b> among other natural features in the area. Independence's gold deposits were quickly opened by miners.

5|$|Once {{satisfied}} with his reorganisation of Thessaly, Philip marched south to <b>the</b> <b>pass</b> of Thermopylae, the gateway to central Greece. He probably intended to follow up his victory over the Phocians by invading Phocis itself, a prospect which greatly alarmed the Athenians, since once he had passed Thermopylae, he could also march on Athens. The Athenians therefore dispatched a force to Thermopylae and occupied the pass; there is some debate as to whether other contingents may have joined the Athenians at Thermopylae. The Athenians were certainly there, since the Athenian orator Demosthenes celebrated the defence of <b>the</b> <b>pass</b> {{in one of his}} speeches. Cawkwell suggests that the Athenian force was the one that Diodorus says was dispatched under Nausicles consisting of 5000 infantry and 400 cavalry, and that they were joined by the remnants of the Phocians and the Pheraean mercenaries. However, Buckler argues that Diodorus never mentions Thermopylae, and the force under Nausicles was sent to help the Phocians the following year; instead, he believes that another Athenian force held <b>the</b> <b>pass</b> unassisted. Although it might have proved possible to force <b>the</b> <b>pass,</b> Philip did not attempt to do so, preferring not to risk a defeat after his great successes in Thessaly.|$|E
