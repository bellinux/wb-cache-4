5|$|On 6 April 1967, Vulcan B.2 XL385 burnt out on {{the runway}} at RAF Scampton at the {{beginning}} of its take-off run. The aircraft was carrying a Blue Steel missile training round. All the crew, including an Air Training Corps cadet, escaped unhurt. The aircraft was engulfed in flames and totally destroyed. The accident was caused by failure of an Olympus 301 HP <b>turbine</b> <b>disc</b> as the engine reached full power.|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 1968, Vulcan B.2 XM604 crashed {{following}} {{a loss of}} control during an overshoot at RAF Cottesmore. The rear crew members were killed though both pilots ejected. The captain ejected at a very late stage and only survived because his deploying parachute was snagged by some power cables. The accident was caused by failure of an Olympus 301 LP <b>turbine</b> <b>disc</b> after the aircraft {{had returned to the}} airfield following indications of a bomb-bay overheat.|$|E
5|$|On March 14, 1980, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 007, an Ilyushin Il-62, {{attempted}} a go-around when the crew experienced troubles with a gear indicator. When thrust was applied, the low pressure <b>turbine</b> <b>disc</b> in engine number 2 disintegrated because of material fatigue; {{parts of the}} disc damaged engines number 1 and 3 and severed control pushers for both horizontal and vertical stabilizers. After 26 seconds of uncontrolled descent, the aircraft crashed, killing all 87 people on board.|$|E

50|$|TurbineFor the {{two-stage}} reaction turbine, a low {{cooling effect}} for the <b>turbine</b> <b>discs</b> was achieved using a skillful airflow, which was diverted from beneath the combustion chamber and directed inwards toward the shaft.

40|$|Gas <b>turbine</b> <b>discs</b> {{are heavily}} loaded due to {{centrifugal}} and thermal loads {{and are therefore}} designed for a service lifetime specified in hours and cycles. New probabilistic design criteria have been worked out at Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery AB and this report is intended to evaluate if existing <b>turbine</b> <b>discs</b> meet the new design criteria. The evaluation is composed of two tasks, estimation of failure risk and investigation of which parameters that have large effect on the results. The outcome from the evaluations show that the failure risks are smaller than the maximum failure risks allowed in the design criteria. Further, creep strain rate, temperature and creep rupture strain are identified to have large effect on the results in the first case. In the second case blade load and other mechanical loads as well as yield stress show large effect on the results...|$|R
5|$|On May 9, 1987, {{improperly}} assembled bearings in Il-62M engine number 2 on LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055 overheated {{and exploded}} during cruise over {{the village of}} Lipinki, causing the shaft to break in two; this caused the low-pressure <b>turbine</b> <b>disc</b> to spin to enormous speeds and disintegrate, damaging engine number 1 and cutting the control pushers. The crew managed to return to Warsaw, using nothing but trim tabs to control the crippled aircraft, but on the final approach, the trim controlling links burned and the crew completely lost control over the aircraft. Soon after, it crashed {{on the outskirts of}} Warsaw; all 183 on board perished. Had the plane stayed airborne for 40 seconds more, it {{would have been able to}} reach the runway.|$|E
25|$|On 22 August 1985 – British Airtours Flight 28M – {{an engine}} failed during {{take-off}} from runway 24, the fire spreading into the cabin, resulting in 55 fatalities (mostly from smoke inhalation) aboard the Boeing 737–236 Advanced G-BGJL. The uncontained engine failure was later traced to an incorrectly repaired combustor causing the <b>turbine</b> <b>disc</b> to shatter and puncture the wing fuel tanks. As a result, fire resistance and evacuation procedures were improved.|$|E

25|$|Qantas Flight 32 was a Qantas {{scheduled}} passenger {{flight that}} suffered an uncontained engine failure on 4 November 2010 {{and made an}} emergency landing at Singapore Changi Airport. The failure {{was the first of}} its kind for the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger aircraft. It marked the first aviation occurrence involving an Airbus A380. On inspection it was found that a <b>turbine</b> <b>disc</b> in the aircraft's No.2 Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine (on the port side nearest the fuselage) had disintegrated. In addition to destruction of the engine, this caused damage to the nacelle, wing, fuel system, landing gear, flight controls, the controls for engine No.1 and a fire in the left inner wing fuel tank that self-extinguished. The failure was determined to have been caused by the breaking of a stub oil pipe which had been manufactured improperly.|$|E

2500|$|Mk.320:The {{performance}} specification for the BAC TSR-2 was issued in 1962. It {{was to be}} powered by two BSEL Olympus Mk 320 (BOl.22R) engines each rated at [...] dry and [...] with reheat at take-off. The engine, which was re-stressed for supersonic flight at sea level, and over Mach 2.0 at altitude, and featured much use of high-temperature alloys such as titanium and Nimonic, was a cutting edge derivative of the Olympus Mk 301 with a Solar-type afterburner. The engine first ran in March 1961, soon achieving , and was test flown in February 1962 in an underslung nacelle {{in the belly of}} Vulcan B1 XA894 and was demonstrated at the Farnborough Air Show in September. In December 1962 during a full power ground run at Filton, the LP shaft failed. The liberated <b>turbine</b> <b>disc</b> ruptured fuel tanks and the subsequent fire completely destroyed the Vulcan.|$|E
30|$|The strain {{accumulation}} criterion {{was successful}} in predicting both the path {{and the rate of}} crack growth under dwell fatigue.

40|$|Many {{engineering}} {{components are}} subjected to conditions which have a detrimental effect on the materials from which they are made. Such components are used, for example, within high temperature regions of aeroengines (e. g. <b>turbine</b> <b>discs)</b> and power plant (e. g. steam pipes) and such conditions can include periods of isothermal and/or thermo-mechanical cyclic loading which may cause fatigue, excessive plasticity and creep. The combination of conditions to which the materials are subjected can have a strong influence on the failure mechanisms induced within the material. This study {{is concerned with the}} identification of the failure mechanisms which occur in RR 1000 (a Nickel-based superalloy used in aeroengine <b>turbine</b> <b>discs)</b> tested under both isothermal and anisothermal cyclic conditions. The various types of test conditions applied to the specimens (e. g. waveforms which contain high temperature tensile conditions or alternatively low temperature tensile conditions) and the related failure mechanisms (e. g. intergranular, transgranular or mixed cracking), have been identified. Comparisons of the predictions of failure lives with experimental data from tested specimens, subjected to various test conditions, are also presented...|$|R
50|$|Of axial-flow {{design with}} 15-stage {{compressor}} and 7-stage turbine, it incorporated many modern features. These included a rigid compressor-turbine rotor assembly carried on {{front and rear}} bearings. There was a single annular combustion chamber, of reverse-flow configuration to shorten the engine, air cooling of the <b>turbine</b> <b>discs</b> and <b>turbine</b> blades with extended roots to reduce heat transfer to the disc. The annular air intake surrounded a reduction gear for propeller drive takeoff, and the exhaust duct was also annular.|$|R
2500|$|In January 1940, the Ministry {{placed a}} {{contract}} with the Gloster Aircraft Company for a simple aircraft specifically to flight-test the W.1, the Gloster E.28/39. They also placed a second engine contract, this time for a larger design that developed into the otherwise similar W.2. In February work started on a third design, the W.1A, which was the size of the W.1 but used the W.2's mechanical layout. The W.1A allowed them to flight test the W.2's basic mechanical design in the E.28/39. Power Jets also spent some time in May 1940 drawing up the W.2Y, a similar design with a [...] "straight-through" [...] airflow that resulted in a longer engine and, more critically, a longer driveshaft but having a somewhat simpler layout. To reduce the weight of the driveshaft as much as possible, the W.2Y used a large diameter, thin-walled, shaft almost as large as the <b>turbine</b> <b>disc,</b> [...] "necked down" [...] at either end where it connected to the turbine and compressor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Inconel 718 is an age {{hardenable}} nickel base supper alloy {{with high}} strength at elevated temperatures, and excellent creep properties. It is used extensively in <b>turbine</b> <b>discs,</b> blades where components experience elevated temperatures for prolonged duration, leading to coarsening of the microstructure. To evaluate {{the life of}} such components after prolonged exposure to service conditions, LCF properties at such large grain sizes are essential. For this purpose, low cycle fatigue (LCF) behavior of forged Inconel 718 <b>turbine</b> rotor <b>disc</b> having large grain size was studied at room temperature. Total strain controlled fatigue tests were conducted in air at ambient temperature on this alloy in solution treated and aged condition.

40|$|Inconel 718 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used superalloys for high temperature applications in gasturbines and aeroengines and is for example used for components such as <b>turbine</b> <b>discs.</b> <b>Turbine</b> <b>discs</b> can be subjected to temperatures up to ~ 700 °C towards the outer radius of the disc. During service, the discs might start to develop cracks due to fatigue and long dwell times. Additionally, temperature variations during use can lead to large thermal transients during start-up and shutdown which can lead to overload peaks in the normal dwell time cycle. In this study, tests at 550 °C with an overload prior to the start of each dwell time, have been performed. The aim of the investigation was to get a better understanding of the effects of overloads on the microstructure and crack mechanisms. The microstructure was studied using electron channelling contrast imaging (ECCI). The image analysis toolbox in Matlab was used on cross sections of the cracks to quantify: crack length, branch length, and the number of branches in each crack. It was found that the amount of crack branching increases with an increasing overload and that the branch length decreases with an increasing overload. When the higher overloads were applied, the dwell time effect was almost cancelled out. There is a strong tendency for an increased roughness of the crack path with an increasing crack growth rate...|$|R
