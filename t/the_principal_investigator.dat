5|$|The philosopher A. J. Ayer was a pupil at Ascham St Vincent's School in Carlisle Road. The artist Eric Ravilious grew up, {{was educated}} and taught in Eastbourne. In {{addition}} to Orwell, Connolly, Beaton, Maxwell and Longhurst {{listed on the}} St Cyprian's School blue plaque, the writers Alaric Jacob, E. H. W. Meyerstein and Alan Hyman also attended that school. The biographer and historian Philip Ziegler was a pupil as was the music historian Dyneley Hussey and politician, historian and diarist Alan Clark. Other politicians were Richard Wood who had lost both legs in the war, and David Ormsby-Gore later ambassador to the USA. Artists Cedric Morris and David Kindersley also attended the school as did military figures such as General Sir Lashmer Whistler and Major General Henry Foot VC. Pupils with sporting connections include the amateur jockey Anthony Mildmay and Seymour de Lotbiniere Director of Outside Broadcasts at the BBC. Jagaddipendra Narayan was a reigning Maharaja of Cooch Behar while at the school. Other former pupils include the war-blinded life peer Lord Fraser and the submarine commander Rupert Lonsdale.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the innovative control of an accelerometer {{to support the}} needs of the scientists operating science experiments that are on-board Space Station Freedom (SSF). Accelerometers in support of science experiments on the shuttle have typically been passive, record-only devices that present data only after the mission or that present limited data to the crew or ground operators during the mission. With the advent of science experiment operations on SSF, <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> <b>investigators</b> will need microgravity acceleration data during, as well as after, experiment operations. Because their data requirements may change during the experiment operations, <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> <b>investigators</b> will be allocated some control of accelerometer parameters. This paper summarizes the general-purpose Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS) operation that supports experiments on the shuttle and {{describes the}} control of the SAMS for Space Station Freedom. Emphasis is placed on the proposed ground-based control of the accelerometer by <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> <b>investigators...</b>|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} to predict {{the likelihood of a}} DNA sequence forming a Z-DNA structure.

25|$|ASU is also {{involved}} with NASA {{in the field}} of space exploration. To meet the needs of NASA programs, ASU built the LEED Gold Certified, 298,000-square-foot Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building IV (ISTB 4) at a cost of $110million in 2012. The building includes space for the School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE) and includes labs and other facilities for the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering. One of the main projects at ISTB 4 includes the OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer (OTES). Although ASU built the spectrometers aboard the Martian rovers Spirit and Opportunity, OTES will be the first major scientific instrument completely designed and built at ASU for a NASA space mission. Phil Christensen, <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> <b>investigator</b> for the Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES), is a Regents' Professor at ASU.

25|$|A {{research}} {{team from the}} National Autonomous University of Mexico headed by Rafael Navarro-González, concluded that the GCMS equipment (TV-GC-MS) used by the Viking program to search for organic molecules, may not be sensitive enough to detect low levels of organics.

Because of the simplicity of sample handling, TV–GC–MS is still considered the standard method for organic detection on future Mars missions, so Navarro-González suggests that the design of future organic instruments for Mars should include other methods of detection.|$|E

25|$|Initially, {{graduate}} students usually rotate through the laboratories of several faculty researchers, {{after which the}} student commits to joining a particular laboratory {{for the remainder of}} his or her education.

Students graduate once a thesis project of significant scope to justify the writing of their dissertation has been completed, a point that is determined by the student's principal investigator as well as his or her faculty advisory committee. The average time to graduation can vary between institutions, but most programs average around 5–6 years.|$|E
