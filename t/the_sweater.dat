5|$|Of {{particular}} emphasis was the children's fascination with Maurice Richard. Montreal's star player from 1942 until 1960, Richard was a prolific goal scorer. In the 1944–45 season– {{one year before}} the events of The Hockey Sweater– Richard became the first player in National Hockey League history to score 50 goals in a 50-game season. Richard attended the 1980 premiere of <b>The</b> <b>Sweater</b> in Montreal, and according to Carrier, was moved to tears by the film. Richard also requested copies {{so that he could}} show it to his own children.|$|E

5000|$|The Clancy Brothers mother read news of {{the terrible}} ice and snow storms in New York City and sent Aran sweaters for her sons and Tommy Makem to keep them warm. They wore <b>the</b> <b>sweaters</b> for <b>the</b> first time at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan, simply {{as part of their}} regular winter clothes. When the groups manager Marty Erlichman, who had been searching for a special [...] "look" [...] for the group, saw <b>the</b> <b>sweaters,</b> he exclaimed, [...] "Thats it! Thats it! Thats what youre going to wear." [...] Ehrlichman {{requested}} that the group wear <b>the</b> <b>sweaters</b> on their upcoming television appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. After they did, the sales of Aran sweaters rose by 700% according to Liam Clancy, and they soon became the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makems trademark costume.|$|R

She is almost burnt on the stake, but at the last second, her brothers come to the rescue. She throws <b>the</b> <b>sweaters</b> over them, <b>the</b> curse is broken, and she is able to tell her story and return the prince's love.|$|R
25|$|Misdirected attention. The knitter loves their sweater {{a little}} too much, and pesters the {{significant}} other about <b>the</b> <b>sweater.</b> Alternatively, the knitter loves to knit too much, and spends too much time with their knitting instead of with the significant other.|$|E
25|$|Insufficient gratitude. The knitter sees <b>the</b> <b>sweater</b> as a {{significant}} thing, having chosen the pattern and color carefully, and having invested hours of labor; the recipient sees it as just another sweater, and the resulting lack of gratitude leads to tension in the relationship.|$|E

25|$|Many {{workplaces}} {{through history}} have been crowded, low-paying and without job security; {{but the concept}} of a sweatshop originated between 1830 and 1850 as a specific type of workshop in which a certain type of middleman, <b>the</b> <b>sweater,</b> directed others in garment making (the process of producing clothing) under arduous conditions. The terms sweater for the middleman and sweat system for the process of subcontracting piecework were used in early critiques like Charles Kingsley's Cheap Clothes and Nasty, written in 1850, which described conditions in London, England. The workplaces created for the sweating system, a system of subcontracting in the tailoring trade were called sweatshops and might contain only a few workers or as many as 100 and more.|$|E
25|$|His {{retirement}} {{at the end}} of {{that year}} did not mark the close of Geary's involvement with cricket. For over twenty years after that he was cricket coach at Charterhouse and in that time was seen as one of the best coaches any school has ever had. Most notably, the brilliant batsman Peter May admitted that Geary's coaching played a vital role in his development. After he left Charterhouse in 1959, Geary went to Rugby School, who were desperate for assistance to develop young players and improved their fortunes. Geary, as always, served them whole-heartedly, and he bowled, without <b>the</b> <b>sweater</b> to keep him cool, in the nets until he was about seventy-seven, a testimony to his amazing endurance despite many injuries and other setbacks. He died after gradually failing health in 1981 at the age of eighty-seven.|$|E
25|$|Machine-knitted jumpers {{tend to use}} finer wool, cotton, or {{synthetic}} yarn and have less complex patterns, {{since many of the}} traditional stitches cannot be reproduced this way. They are generally flatter, lighter and less substantial, without the pronounced texture of a hand knitted or hand loomed jumper. Machine knitted jumpers will loosen with wear, and so it is advisable to buy one size smaller than the size of <b>the</b> <b>sweater</b> usually worn. They are the least expensive option. Hand-looming allows more complicated stitches to be used, will have fewer stitches to the inch and be thicker. The best quality hand-loomed jumpers are almost indistinguishable from hand knit. Hand-knit jumpers tend to be more tightly knit, to have more complex stitch patterns and to be longer-lasting and they attract a significant price premium. By holding them up to light, the difference between the machine knit and hand knit is evident.|$|E
50|$|The {{choice of}} {{closures}} {{is an important}} practical consideration and can also help define <b>the</b> <b>sweater's</b> style. Buttons and zippers {{are the most common}} choices for sweaters, but frogs, ties and belts are also seen.|$|R

50|$|Toronto Maple Leafs: Toronto's uniforms were {{royal blue}} and white and {{featured}} the distinct striping configuration inspired by the 1930s Maple Leafs. The front crest of the jersey featured a distinct wordmark from the inaugural Maple Leafs' logo, revealed in 1927. The neckline design is taken from <b>the</b> <b>sweaters</b> worn by <b>the</b> Leafs throughout the 1960s and the running stitch detail on the numbers {{is a tribute to}} <b>the</b> Leafs' <b>sweater</b> from <b>the</b> mid-1950s.|$|R
25|$|When {{the team}} changed their name from Kangwon Land to High1 the jerseys {{did not go}} through a {{redesign}} other than to update the logos. Both the home and away jerseys feature a red bottom on {{the main body of}} <b>the</b> <b>sweater</b> and red cuffs on the sleeves. The Home jersey has a black main body with white numbers surrounded by a red outline. The away jersey features black numbers with a red outline. Both jerseys feature a cursive High1 on both shoulders in their respective opposite colors. Sponsorship logos are featured on the right and left upper chest. The red cuff on the right sleeve features a small version of the mascot and the left sleeve features a small blue alien mascot. In 2009 the team added the High1 resort logo to the red section {{on the front of the}} jersey as well as the name in hangeul in the red section on the back of the jersey.|$|E
25|$|For Test matches, {{the team}} wears Cricket Whites, with an {{optional}} sweater or sweater-vest {{with a green}} and gold V-neck for use in cold weather. The sponsor's (currently Commonwealth Bank for Home Test matches and Qantas for Away Test matches) logo is displayed {{on the right side}} of the chest while the Cricket Australia coat-of-arms is displayed on the left. If <b>the</b> <b>sweater</b> is being worn the coat-of-arms is displayed under the V-neck and the sponsor's logo is again displayed {{on the right side of}} the chest. The baggy green, the Australian cricket cap, is considered an essential part of the cricketing uniform and as a symbol of the national team, with new players being presented with one upon their selection in the team. The helmet also prominently displays the Australian cricketing coat-of-arms. At the end of 2011, ASICS was named the manufacture the whites and limited over uniforms from Adidas, with the ASICS logo being displayed on the shirt and pants. Players may choose any manufacturer for their other gear (bat, pads, shoes, gloves, etc.).|$|E

2500|$|In the National Hockey League, {{each team}} {{has its own}} {{distinctive}} sweater design (hockey tradition usually refers to jerseys as [...] "sweaters," [...] because hockey players actually wore <b>sweaters</b> on <b>the</b> ice until the 1960s). Prior to 1995 (save a few isolated instances), each team only had two sweaters – one for home use, and one for <b>the</b> road. One <b>sweater</b> was dominantly white (or in a few instances, a light color), and the other dominantly a dark color. The home team has first choice of uniforms from the 1917–18 to the 1969–70 seasons (the white or yellow <b>sweater</b> was predominantly <b>the</b> road <b>sweater</b> with <b>the</b> dark <b>sweater</b> predominantly being <b>the</b> home <b>sweater),</b> but from <b>the</b> 1970–1971 to the 2002–03 seasons, white (or yellow) sweaters were worn at home and dark sweaters were worn on the road. Since <b>the</b> Third <b>Sweater</b> Program {{was introduced in the}} 1995–96 season, some teams wore <b>the</b> third <b>sweater</b> at home, which would have required an opponent to carry two sets of equipment and uniforms with them while on the road. This was alleviated starting in the 2003–04 season, when new rules mandated dark sweaters at home and white <b>sweaters</b> on <b>the</b> road.|$|R
