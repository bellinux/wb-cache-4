5|$|As the 15th Lok Sabha {{was due to}} {{complete}} its constitutional term on 31 May 2014, a general election was called by the Election Commission for {{the constitution of the}} 16th Lok Sabha. The election was held in nine phases from 7 April to 12 May 2014. The Congress party had won the previous two elections in 2004 and 2009, and so was campaigning to win the election for the third consecutive time. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> election were declared on 16 May, before the 15th Lok Sabha completed its constitutional mandate on 31 May 2014.|$|E
5|$|In May 1934, {{following}} {{reports of}} a Japanese spy operating out of Dutch Harbor, the United States Navy dispatched Edwin T. Layton to the Aleutians to investigate the allegations. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> investigation was the arrest of the only Japanese man in the region, {{as well as the}} town's only prostitute, a woman accused of conspiring with the Japanese man. During the 1930s, a number of United States governmental committees, boards and reports concluded that air bases in the Aleutians would be for the most part impractical due to the region's inclement weather.|$|E
5|$|In a 2003 {{review of}} the literature, Rowan et al. {{proposed}} one model for how LTP might be affected in AD. AD appears to result, at least in part, from misprocessing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> abnormal processing is the accumulation of fragments of this protein, called amyloid β (Aβ). Aβ exists in both soluble and fibrillar forms. Misprocessing of APP results in the accumulation of soluble Aβ that, according to Rowan's hypothesis, impairs hippocampal LTP and {{may lead to the}} cognitive decline seen early in AD.|$|E

5|$|Sigismund III {{subsequently}} {{rejected the}} compromise solution and demanded the tsar's throne for himself, {{which would mean}} complete subjugation of Russia, and as such {{was rejected by the}} bulk of the Russian society. Sigismund's refusal and demands only intensified the chaos, as the Swedes proposed their own candidate and took over Veliki Novgorod. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> situation and of the ruthless Commonwealth occupation in Moscow and elsewhere in Russia was the 1611 popular Russian anti-Polish uprising, heavy fighting in Moscow and a siege of the Polish garrison occupying the Kremlin.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of these two opposite torques creates a resulting yaw torque on the front wheel, and its direction {{is a function of}} the side-slip angle of the tire, the angle between the actual path of the tire and the direction it is pointing, and the camber angle of the tire (the angle that the tire leans from the vertical). <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> torque is often the suppression of the inversion speed predicted by rigid wheel models described above in the section on steady-state turning.|$|E

5|$|The modern Regent Street is <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> redevelopment. No {{original}} structures survive except {{south of}} Oxford Circus for some Nash-designed sewers. The current design {{is an example}} of the Beaux Arts approach to urban design: an assembly of separate buildings on a grand scale, designed to harmonise and produce an impressive overall effect. Strict rules governed the reconstruction. Each block had to be designed with a continuous unifying street façade and finished in Portland stone. The first redevelopment was Regent House, just south of Oxford Circus. The stylistic tone for the rebuilding was set by Sir Reginald Blomfield's Quadrant.|$|E
5|$|The {{pulsations}} {{result from}} a process called the κ-mechanism. A part of the star's outer atmosphere becomes optically thick due to partial ionization of certain elements. When these atoms lose an electron, the likelihood that they will absorb energy increases. This results {{in an increase in}} temperature that causes the atmosphere to expand. The inflated atmosphere becomes less ionized and loses energy, causing it to cool and shrink back down again. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> cycle is a periodic pulsation of the atmosphere and a matching variation of the luminosity.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{certainty}} {{was that}} the investigation was poorly conducted. The crime scene was not secured and searched thoroughly, and evidence was not recorded or preserved. Within a couple of days, the police had burned the bloodstained bedding and carpets, apparently to spare Bamber's feelings. The scenes-of-crime officer moved the murder weapon without wearing gloves, {{and it was not}} examined for fingerprints until weeks later. Three days after the killings, Bamber and the extended family were given back the keys to the house.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{power is}} {{a high level of}} {{organizational}} and policy standardization among the different local jurisdictions allowing them to preserve the uniqueness of their prefecture, city, or town.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{process has}} been {{described}} as being, in effect, an assertion of paramountcy by the Government of India over the states in a more pervasive form. While this contradicted the British statement that paramountcy would lapse on the transfer of power, the Congress position had always been that independent India would inherit the position of being the paramount power.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two major}} valleys in the park, Death Valley and Panamint Valley. Both of these valleys were formed within the last few million years and both are bounded by north–south-trending {{mountain}} ranges. These and adjacent valleys follow the general trend of Basin and Range topography with one modification: there are parallel strike-slip faults that perpendicularly bound the central extent of Death Valley. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> shearing action is additional extension in {{the central part of}} Death Valley which causes a slight widening and more subsidence there.|$|E

5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of the partial aether-dragging hypothesis, another major problem arose with the Michelson–Morley experiment (1887). In Fresnel's theory, the aether is almost stationary, so the experiment should have given a positive result. However, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> experiment was negative. Thus from the viewpoint of the aether models at that time, the experimental situation was contradictory: On one hand, the aberration of light, the Fizeau experiment and the repetition by Michelson and Morley in 1886 appeared to support partial aether-dragging. On the other hand, the Michelson–Morley experiment of 1887 appeared to prove that the aether is at rest with respect to Earth, apparently supporting the idea of complete aether-dragging (see aether drag hypothesis). So the very success of Fresnel's hypothesis in explaining Fizeau's results helped lead to a theoretical crisis, which was not resolved until the development of the theory of special relativity.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{increase}} in the domestic manufacturing industry {{there was still a}} significant shortfall in many items. In part this was due to the priority that military consumption and production necessarily had over civilian, however, there was also a considerable scarcity of raw materials and other components required for manufacturing. This was due both to the lack of shipping available from the United Kingdom, as well as the limitations placed upon the flow of such goods from Britain due to their own increased requirements. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> was inflationary. Domestic prices went up, while the cost of exports was deliberately kept lower than market value in an effort to prevent further inflationary pressures worldwide. As a result, the cost of living for many average Australians was increased considerably.|$|E
5|$|During June and July 1864, Confederate forces {{under the}} command of General Jubal A. Early patrolled the Shenandoah Valley. Early's successes were a {{political}} liability for President Abraham Lincoln, and caused Union leaders to divert resources away from Richmond and West Virginia. Union soldiers from the Army of West Virginia began arriving via the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in Martinsburg, West Virginia, on July 19, and had an initial success in the Battle of Rutherford's Farm. A few days later, Early tricked Union General George Crook into believing that Early had sent a large part of his Confederate force to Richmond. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> deception was a July 24 Confederate victory near Winchester, Virginia, at the Second Battle of Kernstown. Union troops, in some cases panic stricken, retreated to {{the north side of the}} Potomac River.|$|E
