50|$|The E36/5 {{made use}} of the older {{semi-trailing}} arm rear axle, {{as opposed to the}} E36's Z-Axle Multi-link suspension. As the trailing arm design was smaller, it allowed for a lower <b>trunk</b> <b>floor</b> height, fold-down rear seats, and an exterior undermounted compact spare tire.|$|E
50|$|Also {{shared with}} the {{corporate}} X platform {{was part of the}} roof stamping and <b>trunk</b> <b>floor</b> pan (for 1973 and newer X platform vehicles). Cadillac stylists added a crisp, angular body that set the tone for GM styling for the next decade, along with a wide-track stance giving car a substantial, premium appearance. A wide chrome grille flanked by quadruple rectangular headlamps with narrow parking and signal lamps just below filled the header panel, while small wrap-around rectangular tail lamps placed at the outermost corners of the rear gave the appearance of a lower, leaner, and wider car. The wrap-around taillights might have come from a design sketch of a rejected Coupe DeVille concept.|$|E

50|$|For the 2010 model year, {{three new}} model designations became available: Heat, Detonator, and Shock trim levels in either 4x2 or 4x4 versions. The Heat trim was {{equipped}} with a 210-hp 3.7 L V6 engine mated to a four-speed automatic transmission. The Detonator and Shock trims included a 260-hp V6 engine mated to automatic transmission. The Heat trim level had power mirrors, windows and door locks with remote keyless entry, satellite radio, and air conditioning. The Detonator added a rear-park assist, remote start system, power driver's seat, cruise control, an overhead console with a trip computer, compass, and exterior temperature display. The Shock trim added heated front seats, leather trim interior, and a power sunroof. Among standard safety features were: front airbags, side curtain airbags, active head restraints, traction and stability control with roll-over mitigation, brake assist, and a tire-pressure monitor. The Load 'N Go sliding <b>trunk</b> <b>floor</b> feature was discontinued.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, for the 2004 model year, in {{addition}} to the 3.3-liter engine, V6-powered models were equipped with a new five-speed automatic transmission, replacing the four-speed automatic transmission, while the inline-four models continued to use the old four-speed. This year also saw the introduction of the optional third row seat allowing for two additional passengers. The unibody was slightly modified behind the second row seats to include a depression in the <b>trunk</b> <b>floor</b> able to accommodate the optional third row seating. On models without third row seating, this depression was turned into a storage compartment (prior to 2004 the spare tire was accessible from inside the vehicle where the third row seating would subsequently be located; beginning in 2004 the spare tire is accessible from underneath the vehicle). Subtle changes to the front grille, front and rear bumpers, and headlights round-out the major changes for the 2003 mid-cycle refresh.|$|E
50|$|The 240SX was {{released}} {{in the spring of}} 1994 as a 1995 model. The hatchback and convertible body styles were eliminated, leaving only the coupe. The wheelbasecar grew 2 in and the track width was also increased, while the overall length of the vehicle was slightly shorter than the previous generation. The curb weight of the vehicle increased by about 80 lbs kg relative to the 1994 model. Dual air bags were added and the automatic seatbelts were replaced with common manual type. The pop-up headlights were removed in favor of fixed lamps. Though the general layout remained the same, almost all parts were redesigned to the extent that very few parts are interchangeable. The chassis was changed slightly to increase stiffness (Nissan claimed 50% torsional, 100% bending rigidity increase) and utilized higher rear strut mounts. The fuel tank, previously located at the rear end under the <b>trunk</b> <b>floor,</b> now sat in front of the rear suspension and behind the rear seats.|$|E

50|$|Nip-ups depend {{in large}} part on {{developing}} momentum in the legs and then using that momentum to lift the body into the air. A nip-up begins with the performer rolling back onto the shoulders while drawing both legs toward the chest. The legs may be either straight or bent, and hands may optionally be placed on the floor near the ears. The legs are then rapidly thrust away from body <b>trunk</b> and <b>floor</b> while simultaneously pushing away from the floor with hands, if used.|$|R
50|$|The 4102 was {{the first}} Russian {{executive}} car that did not utilized body-on-frame construction, instead it utilized unitized construction. It was also half a meter longer than the Gaz Volga and weighed half a ton less than the ZIL-41041. The roof panels and <b>floor,</b> <b>trunk</b> lid, hood and bumpers were made of fiberglass.|$|R
5000|$|On {{its sixth}} and last restyling, Ford {{tried to bring}} its design in line, as it is sold along its more modern [...] "siblings", the Ford Taunus, Sierra, and later the Escort. Changes include new bumpers with rubber strips and rubber end caps, new large {{rectangular}} taillights with amber turn signals, bronze-tinted glass replaced green, and a larger trunk by reconfiguring the <b>trunk</b> <b>floor</b> and repositioning the spare tyre, and other minor cosmetic changes. The Rural continued to use the original taillights. The Taxi and Sprint versions were dropped, and the Futura was changed into the Ghia. A 2.3-litre four-cylinder petrol engine was available, as was, as of 1988, a rare 2.4-litre diesel. The diesel, a [...] Italian-made VM HR492, was installed by Borward Puntana, but as {{they were unable to}} provide engines at the pace needed by Ford, the project soon came to a halt. Most of the diesels built were Ranchero pickups. The pickup truck, capable of a 715 kg max load, continued to be available with the 3.3- and 3.6-litre sixes, as well as the new four.|$|E
50|$|The CSL {{also had}} various {{aesthetic}} modifications over the standard M3. It received an aerodynamic lightweight body kit which included carbon fibre front splitters that improved down force {{at high speeds}} by 50%, {{as well as a}} carbon fibre rear diffuser. The front bumper had a distinct hole that is used to draw cool air into the newly designed air intake. The <b>trunk</b> <b>floor</b> cover was made of lightweight fibre-board (not cardboard as infamously described by BBC Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson). The trunk lid was redesigned to incorporate a raised lip, unlike the standard M3 where one is simply added onto a flat trunk. The CSL was sold with distinct 19-inch lightweight cast BBS alloy rims that came with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup semi-slick racing tyres. The interior of the CSL is redesigned with a sporty weight-saving theme. The CSL obtains fibreglass front racing bucket seats, and fibreglass backed rear seats. The center console, door panels and trim, and head-liner are all formed from carbon fibre, and the steering wheel is redesigned with cruise control, stereo, and phone controls removed to include just a single button that activates the M track mode.|$|E
50|$|The new, larger Beetle {{was sold}} as the 1302/1302 S, {{offering}} nearly 43% more luggage capacity, up from 140 liters in front to 260 (remaining at 140 in back) A new MacPherson {{strut front suspension}} was incorporated, similar to what {{was used in the}} Type 4, and the front track was widened. The new suspension layout allowed the spare tire to be positioned flat under the <b>trunk</b> <b>floor,</b> although the car had to be lengthened slightly to accomplish this. It allowed a reduction in turning radius. To gain additional trunk volume, the under-dash panel was lowered, allowing the fuel tank to be shifted rearward. From the windscreen back the big Beetle was identical to its smaller progenitor, except for having the semi-trailing arm rear suspension as standard equipment. Overall, the bigger Beetle was 50 mm longer, 35 mm wider, and rode on a 20 mm-longer wheelbase. Both Beetles were available with or without the L Package. The convertible was now based on the 1302 body. In North America, the 1302 was marketed as the Super Beetle and came only with the L Package and 1600 cc engine. While it lacked the front disc brakes that normally accompanied the larger motor, it was fitted with brake drums that were slightly larger than the standard Beetle. With the Super Beetle being sold as the premium model in North America, the standard Beetle, while retaining the same 1600 cc engine, was stripped of many of its earlier features {{in order to reduce the}} selling price. Bright window and running board moldings disappeared, along with the day/night mirror, horn ring, map pocket, locking glove box and miscellaneous other items.|$|E

It is therefore significant that the practical consequences of the Carroll decision would be largely nullified if the permissible scope of a warrantless search of an automobile did not include containers and packages found inside the vehicle. Contraband goods rarely are strewn across the <b>trunk</b> or <b>floor</b> of a car; since by their very nature such goods must be withheld from public view, they rarely can be placed in an automobile unless they are enclosed within some form of container.

50|$|Initially 8 {{blocks of}} office {{buildings}} were {{built by the}} developer. These are purpose built for multimedia companies by being provided extra height ceiling and under <b>floor</b> <b>trunking</b> (some with raised floor), fibre optic wiring, dual redundant power supply, uninterruptible power supply and back up generators for whole electricity load, which common practice in Malaysia is only to 30% load.|$|R
50|$|Twenty-two {{pairs of}} {{internal}} frames, also made of oak, were arranged {{head to tail}} to give almost vertical sides. All the pairs consisted of two timbers, each made of a single naturally bent timber which was cut from a tree junction (main <b>trunk</b> as <b>floor</b> support, and branch junction as side support). In every case, frames were always installed in pairs covering the whole length of the bottom, but alternatively supporting only {{one side of the}} hull. The only exception is a sixth pair, which was a single piece of oak with a mortise cut in the center to function as a mast-step. The framing was fastened to the planks with some 300 iron nails driven from inside. They passed first through the frame, and then the strakes. Any projecting end was clenched at the right angle (double-clenched according to some sources).|$|R
40|$|AbstractMutational {{analyses}} {{have shown}} that the genesno tail(ntl, Brachyuryhomolog),floating head(flh,aNothomeobox gene), andcyclops(cyc) play direct and essential roles in the development of midline structures in the zebrafish. In bothntlandflhmutants a notochord does not develop, and incycmutants the floor plate is nearly entirely missing. We made double mutants to learn how these genes might interact. Midline development is disrupted to a greater extent incyc;flhdouble mutants than in eithercycorflhsingle mutants; their effects appear additive. Both the notochord and floor plate are completely lacking, and other phenotypic disturbances suggest that midline signaling functions are severely reduced. On the other hand, trunk midline defects inflh;ntldouble mutants are not additive, but are most often similar to those inntlsingle mutants. This finding reveals that loss ofntlfunction can suppress phenotypic defects due to mutation atflh,and we interpret it to mean that the wild-type allele ofntl(ntl+) functions upstream toflhin a regulatory hierarchy. Loss of function ofntlalso strongly suppresses the floor plate deficiency incycmutants, for we found <b>trunk</b> <b>floor</b> plate to be present incyc;ntldouble mutants. From these findings we propose thatntl+plays an early role in cell fate choice at the dorsal midline, mediated by the Ntl protein acting to antagonize floor plate development as well as to promote notochord development...|$|E

30|$|A MFFD {{test was}} applied {{according}} to the procedures developed by Magnusson et al. [24]. Participants were asked to stand on a footstool (34  cm length, 19  cm weight, 23  cm height), grab a wooden stick with both hands while keeping both thumbs closed and both knees completely extended, and, from there on, flex the <b>trunk</b> towards the <b>floor,</b> with head and arms relaxed (see Fig.  1 a). The participants were instructed to bend one leg after each other. Final flexion position was indicated by a sensation of muscular tension that caused initial hamstring discomfort. Finger-floor distance (in centimeter) was quantified using a measuring tape, yielding the MFFD value.|$|R
40|$|In most {{models of}} glacial erosion, glacier sliding {{velocity}} is hypothesized to control rates of bedrock erosion. If {{this hypothesis is}} correct, then the elevation difference between hanging and <b>trunk</b> valley <b>floors,</b> the hang height, should be dictated by the relative sliding velocities of the glaciers that occupied these valleys. By considering sliding velocity to be proportional to balance velocity and using mass continuity, hang height is {{expressed in terms of}} glacier catchment areas, slopes, and widths, which can be estimated for past glaciers from the morphology of glacial valleys. These parameters were estimated for 46 hanging valleys and their trunk valleys in three adjacent regions of Jasper National Park. The variability in valley morphology can account for 55 – 85 % of the hang height variability if erosion rate scales with balance velocity raised to a power of 1 / 3. This correspondence is in spite of spatial variations in glaciation duration, snow accumulation rates, and other variables that likely affected hang heights but cannot be readily estimated and so are not included in our formulation. Thus it appears that balance velocity, and by extension, sliding velocity if the two are proportional, may be a reasonable control variable for assessing erosion rate...|$|R
60|$|No one slept {{very heavily}} that night. Both arms {{were needed to}} grip the berth, while the trunks below wound the carpet-slips into knots and {{battered}} the framing of the cabins.

50|$|The high {{complexity}} of the Bornean tropical rain forest has created many niches that accommodate a rich diversity of fauna. Some fauna are specialised and some coexisted by having niche separation to avoid inter- and intra-specific competition within the same habitat. Ecological separation {{can be in the}} form of different feeding guilds, niche separation by stratification and different utilisation strategies by being diurnal or nocturnal. For example, vertebrate fauna (birds and mammals) can be defined into six communities based on vertical stratification of the rainforest. First, the small mammals and birds use the forest ground floor and underground. Second, the large herbivores and carnivorous animals range the ground floor of the forest searching for food, shelter and breed. Third, omnivorous and carnivorous mammals range up and down tree <b>trunk</b> from forest <b>floor</b> to the canopy level. Fourth, are mainly volant mammals such as bats and birds using the middle canopy. Fifth, are top canopy birds and mammals that feed on leaves, fruits, nectar and insects. Sixth, are the fast flying birds and bats using the above canopy area.|$|R
6000|$|The {{home of the}} Birkenholt {{family was}} not one of the least delightful. It stood {{at the foot of a}} rising ground, on which grew a grove of {{magnificent}} beeches, their large silvery boles rising majestically like columns into a lofty vaulting of branches, covered above with tender green foliage. Here and there the shade beneath was broken by the gilding of a ray of sunshine on a lower twig, or on a white <b>trunk,</b> but the <b>floor</b> of the vast arcades was almost entirely of the russet brown of the fallen leaves, save where a fern or holly bush made a spot of green. At the foot of the slope lay a stretch of pasture ground, some parts covered by [...] "lady-smocks, all silver white," [...] with the course of the little stream through the midst indicated by a perfect golden river of shining kingcups interspersed with ferns. Beyond lay tracts of brown heath and brilliant gorse and broom, which stretched for miles and miles along the flats, while the dry ground was covered with holly brake, and here and there woods of oak and beech made a sea of verdure, purpling in the distance.|$|R
40|$|Bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum Pursh) {{is a large}} {{deciduous}} {{tree that}} is abundant in western North America. This study addressed whether the predicted increase in abundance of bigleaf maple because of climate change could influence forest hydrology and site fertility due to species-specific effects on incident rainfall distribution and nutrient cycling. The study examined the spatial and temporal variation of forest floor, throughfall, and stemflow properties associated with bigleaf maple in a forest dominated by conifers. In bigleaf maple plots, the throughfall enrichment ratio of major chemicals was highest for NO 3 during the leafed period and for P, K, Ca, and Mg during the leaf senescence period. The fluxes of DOC, total-N, DON, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, and SO 4 in throughfall {{were higher in the}} leafless period than the leafed period. Compared to conifer trees, throughfall was larger for bigleaf maple and had a higher pH, and concentrations and fluxes of P and K. Similarly, stemflow of bigleaf maple had higher pH, and K concentration. The under-canopy and near <b>trunk</b> forest <b>floor</b> associated with bigleaf maple trees showed higher pH, total exchangeable bases, cation exchange capacity and concentrations of exchangeable Ca and Mg compared to Douglas-fir. The application of the PCNM method enabled us to segregate the broad and fine spatial patterns and to extract the main factors impacting forest floor pH and possibly other soil properties at multiple scales. It revealed that topography mainly acts broadly and canopy cover, canopy density and moisture content act at a finer scale. A random design has a higher accuracy in mapping the spatial distribution of forest floor pH and NH 4 compared to stratified random and systematic cluster designs, and a sample size of 50 seems to be adequate for mapping the spatial structure of both variables. This study contributes to the understanding of species-specific impacts on soil properties in a mixed forest and suggests that bigleaf maple has a positive effect on site quality. This would enable it to have legacy effects on soil fertility, enhance overall ecosystem resilience, and promote conifer productivity later in succession following mortality of bigleaf maple...|$|R
50|$|The raised {{roof was}} still kept as a {{distinction}} to previous models, {{but the new}} body is smoother, rounder, and about 3 inches longer, with a slightly longer wheelbase. Called a “boxer” for the way its pistons would flail outward as opposed to moving up and down, the engine of this car remained an original four cylinder. The new engine was known to provide more low-end torque and better fuel economy as well, which adds to its overall smooth ride. There were not any new changes to the front suspension, {{but there was a}} complete makeover to the rear suspension, which included a new design that occupied less of the backspace. This adds more room in the <b>trunk</b> and cargo <b>floor</b> for the convenience of the owner. In terms of safety, improvements that were made consist of the three-point seat belts for the driver and additional four passengers. There is also a child-safety-seat anchor for all of the seat positions in the back. For the front, the seat belts are positioned to better hold the driver and front passenger along with front and rear air bags installed to protect the people in such cases that there is a collision. The Subaru Outback received a good rating from The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in 2000 for its performance in a safety demonstration of a crash test at 40 miles per hour. The Outback has been since developing to make it as safe, smooth, and convenient of a ride that it can be.|$|R
40|$|EMG AND STRENGTH IN TRUNK AND HIP MUSCLES - PARTICULARLY THE ILIOPSOAS Eva A. Andersson Dissertation {{from the}} Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute, and the Department of Human Biology, University College of Physical Education and Sports, Box 5626, S-l 14 86, Stockholm, Sweden.. The overall {{aim of this}} thesis was to study the myoelectric {{activity}} of all major muscles involved in the movements and stabilization of the trunk, pelvis and hips during training exercises, postures, motor tasks, maximal strength performance and locomotion. By the use of ultra-sound, EMG electrodes could be guided safely and accurately into muscles situated even close to the spinal column, such as psoas, quadratus lumborum and deep parts of erector spinae. A task specific variation in activation levels were seen between muscle synergies, {{as well as between}} individual muscles within a synergy. Selective engagement of the abdominal muscles could be achieved in trunk flexion sit-ups, that is lifting only the upper <b>trunk</b> from the <b>floor.</b> An even higher activation of abdominal muscles was needed for static stabilization of the trunk and pelvis during hip flexion sit-ups, whereas single leg lifts were performed without involvement of the abdominal muscles. A selective activation of either the iliacus or psoas muscles was observed, for example in certain types of training exercises and in walking and running. Applying bending moments to the spine, resulted in a grading of the muscle activation response according to mechanical advantage, that is highest in the quadratus lumborum in lateral loading and in the superficial erector spinae in ventral loading. An exception was the most forward flexed position in standing where the superficial erector spinae "relaxed" but quadratus lumborum remained active. In general, the level of EMG in maximal efforts was maintained at the same high level irrespective of position in the range of motion, despite a marked variation in strength output. This position-dependency, as well as the strength values as such, varied in a specific way in groups of athletes, related to previous training background. These data contribute to the understanding of muscle function and motor control of the trunk, pelvis and hips. They are also of relevance when evaluating and designing tests and training programs in rehabilitation and sports contexts as well as for improving biomechanical models of spinal loading.

50|$|Triple H {{entered the}} ring behind the DX Band, {{performing}} Break It Down live, finishing with Chris Warren on Triple H's shoulders {{and the band}} throwing the drums apart. The WWF Intercontinental Championship Ladder match began with Triple H clotheslining The Rock {{to the floor and}} striking him on the ground before a facebuster onto his knee and crotch chopping Rock. An early Rock Bottom was blocked with a strike, while Rock reversed the Pedigree by standing up and forcing Triple H over the top rop onto the mat. Rock's attempt to bring the ladder into the match saw him attacked from behind by Triple H and thrown from crowd barrier into crowd barrier. Inside the ring, Rock was allowed some time and used it to recover and take the fight to Triple H, throwing him through the ladder back outside the ring. As Rock secured the ladder inside the ring and began to climb it, Triple H slowly made his way back to ringside, climbing from the apron to the turnbuckle and jumping into Rock's back, forcing his head into the ladder and causing him to fall off however as the momentum shook Triple H to the side, the ladder fell on top of him. After Triple H drove the ladder into Rock's chest he began to climb it but four steps up, Rock pulled away at his leg, causing him to land on his previously injured knee. After continuing to work on Triple H's knee, Rock pushed the ladder onto his leg and then used it as a vice, trapping his knee in it and kicking the ladder on it, then using a chair similar to a hammer, reinforcing the ladder onto the knee. Rock then set up the ladder horizontally between the steps and the crowd barrier, picking his opponent up for a modified atomic drop, but with the knee taking the brunt of the drop onto the ladder. However, as The Rock took his time to take the ladder into the ring and set it up before climbing it, Triple H was able to desperately push his opponent off it and throw him out of the ring. The advantage did not remain though, as his own plans were used against him when Rock threw Triple H by his legs into the closed ladder, then falling face first onto the Spanish announce table. As Triple H crawled around, the fight moved to the walkway where both opponents threw each other into the barriers before Triple H tried to perform a Pedigree onto the ladder, but was tossed over his back onto it instead. Back inside the ring, Mark Henry threw a second ladder to Rock which he began to climb while Henry tried to subdue Triple H on the outside but was met with a forearm by Chyna. Triple H arrived just in time to push Rock off the ladder, crashing onto the mat and outside the ring. Triple H received similar treatment after recovering, then climbing the ladder only to have the ladder fall away from beneath him. After a DDT that left both men floored, both men eventually stood back up and then climbed either side of the same ladder, punching each other at the top with Triple H being thrown into the ladder in the turnbuckle and rebound to knock Rock off the ladder onto the ropes. Chyna had Triple H a chair which he hit Rock with, albeit with a ladder in the middle and continued a barage of chair shots onto Rock through the ladder. This would not keep Rock down though, as he soon scooped Triple H onto the ladder and performed the People's Elbow with Triple H lying on the ladder. Despite receiving a Rock Bottom, Triple H managed to stagger to his feet just in time to pull Rock off the top rung of the ladder by his <b>trunks</b> and <b>flooring</b> him with a Pedigree. Struggling back to his feet anyway, Henry threw flour into Triple H's eyes but he slowly managed to climb by feel alone; although Rock was able to climb up to the top and meet him, Chyna used her forearm to low blow Rock, buying Triple H enough time to take the belt from where it was hanging.|$|R
