5|$|In the Indian Ocean, loggerheads feed {{along the}} coastlines of Africa, <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> {{and in the}} Arabian Sea. Along the African coastline, loggerheads nest from Mozambique's Bazaruto Archipelago to South Africa's St Lucia estuary. The largest Indian Ocean nesting site is Oman, on <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> which hosts around 15,000 nests, giving it the second largest nesting {{population}} of loggerheads in the world. Western Australia is another notable nesting area, with 1,000–2,000 nests per year.|$|E
5|$|The proto-Arabian horse {{may have}} been domesticated {{by the people of}} <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>peninsula</b> known today as the Bedouin, some time after they learned to use the camel, {{approximately}} 4,000–5,000years ago. One theory is that this development occurred in the Nejd plateau in central Arabia. Other scholars, noting that horses were common in the Fertile Crescent but rare in <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>peninsula</b> prior to the rise of Islam, theorize that the breed as it is known today only developed in large numbers when the conversion of the Persians to Islam in the 7th century brought knowledge of horse breeding and horsemanship to the Bedouin. The oldest depictions in <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> of horses that are clearly domesticated date no earlier than 1800-2000 BCE.|$|E
5|$|Within the Indian Ocean {{north of}} the equator, {{tropical}} cyclones are tracked by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is the officially designated Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the region. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also tracks storms in the basin on an unofficial basis. The Arabian Sea, which borders <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> typically spawns tropical cyclones in the southeastern portion {{of the body of}} water, offshore of western India. About 48.5% of cyclones dissipate without making landfall, or moving ashore, and around one in three storms move toward <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> However, storms do not form in the western Arabian Sea because of cool sea surface temperatures (the result of strong winds from the monsoon), as well as dry air from <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b>|$|E

5|$|Heraclius soon {{experienced}} a new event, the Muslim conquests. Emerging from <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> the Muslims quickly conquered the Sasanian Empire.

5|$|Mogadishu {{traditionally}} {{served as}} a commercial and financial centre.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> is a {{peninsula}} {{between the}} Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, and the Persian Gulf. There are 57known tropical cyclones that affected the peninsula, primarily Yemen and Oman. For convenience, storms are included that affected the Yemeni island of Socotra. Most {{of the tropical}} cyclones originated in the Arabian Sea, {{the portion of the}} Indian Ocean north of the equator and west of India. The remainder formed in the Bay of Bengal off India's east coast. Collectively, the 57storms have caused at least US$5.7billion in damage and 1,662deaths. The strongest and most damaging cyclone was Cyclone Gonu, which caused US$4billion in damage and 50fatalities when it struck Oman in 2007. Tropical cyclone damage in <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> is chiefly due to flooding.|$|E

5|$|Palmyrene trade {{reached its}} apex {{during the second}} century, aided by two factors; {{the first was a}} trade route built by Palmyrenes, and {{protected}} by garrisons at major locations, including a garrison in Dura-Europos manned in 117 AD. The second was the Roman conquest of the Nabataean capital Petra in 106, shifting control over southern trade routes of <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> from the Nabataeans to Palmyra.|$|E

5|$|A {{danger to}} {{agriculture}} is wheat rust, a pathogenic fungus causing reddish patches, coloured by its spores. A virulent {{form of the}} wheat disease, stem rust, strain Ug99, spread from Africa across to <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> by 2007. In field trials in Kenya, more than 85% of wheat samples, including major cultivars, were susceptible, implying that higher crop diversity was required. The Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug argued for action to ensure global food security.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed in the Bay of Bengal passed over the southern Indian subcontinent and developed into a depression in the Arabian Sea off the southern Maharashtra coast on October 11. The depression did not develop as it drifted west, and it degenerated into an area of {{low pressure}} as it was approaching <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> The depression brought widespread rains to southern Maharashtra and Karnataka states, with 40mm (1.5in) of rain recorded in Karwar. Scattered heavy rain was also reported in the Laccadives.|$|E
5|$|Arabian horses also {{spread to}} the rest of the world via the Ottoman Empire, which rose in 1299. Though it never fully {{dominated}} the heart of <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> this Turkish empire obtained many Arabian horses through trade, diplomacy and war. The Ottomans encouraged formation of private stud farms in order to ensure a supply of cavalry horses, and Ottoman nobles, such as Muhammad Ali of Egypt also collected pure, desert-bred Arabian horses.|$|E

5|$|Many centuries later, both {{world wars}} saw {{fighting}} in the desert.

50|$|The {{city had}} an {{important}} location, as it was located on a trade route, which had {{a great impact on}} the lives of the inhabitants due to their contacts with people from other nations.
