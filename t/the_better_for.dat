He also {{decided that he would}} go from Europe and try his luck as a free settler of Australia, which had been founded less than fifty years before. After being granted a letter of recommendation as a free settler, Spark voyaged on the Princess Charlotte to arrive in Sydney in April 1823. After arriving, Alexander set up a shop in George Street, where he sold sugar, wines and alcohol and various drapery. Spark also supplied salted meat to the commissariat at Sydney and Parramatta at the time.|$|E

25|$|Somerset Sabres {{completed}} their run by springing the final upset to beat Lancashire Lightning in the Twenty20 Cup final. It should perhaps have been renamed Sixteen16, because rain {{earlier in the}} day delayed the schedule and meant that the final had been shortened to 16 overs a side, while the semi-finals had both been 20 overs. However, Somerset didn't mind - their strongest batsmen were their numbers one and two, Graeme Smith and Marcus Trescothick, and the more relative impact these two would have, <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> the Sabres. Their task was made easier, though, as Somerset fast bowler Andrew Caddick dug out a couple of early Lancashire wickets, which was followed a run-out and two wickets in two balls from Richard Johnson, as Lancashire crawled to 41 for 5.|$|E
25|$|A dyad is a two-person group; a triad is a three-person group. In a dyad {{a person}} is able to retain their individuality. There is no other person to shift {{the balance of the}} group thereby {{allowing}} those within the dyad to maintain their individuality. In the triad group there is a possibility of a dyad forming within the triad thereby threatening the remaining individual's independence and causing them to become the subordinate of the group. This seems to be an essential part of society which becomes a structure. Unfortunately as the group (structure) becomes increasingly greater the individual becomes separated and grows more alone, isolated and segmented. Simmel's view was somewhat ambiguous with respect to group size. On one hand he believed that the bigger the group <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> the individual. In a larger group it would be harder to exert control on individual, {{but on the other hand}} with a large group there is a possibility of the individual becoming distant and impersonal. Therefore, in an effort for the individual to cope with the larger group they must become a part of a smaller group such as the family.|$|E

500|$|OK Computer {{triggered}} a minor revival of progressive rock and ambitious concept albums, {{with a new}} wave of prog-influenced bands crediting OK Computer for enabling their scene to thrive. Brandon Curtis of Secret Machines said, [...] "Songs like Paranoid Android made it OK to write music differently, to be more experimental... OK Computer was important because it reintroduced unconventional writing and song structures." [...] Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree added, [...] "I don't think ambition is a dirty word any more. Radiohead were the Trojan Horse in that respect. Here's a band that came from the indie rock tradition that snuck in under the radar when the journalists weren't looking and started making these absurdly ambitious and pretentious—and all <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> it—records." [...] In 2005, Q named OK Computer the tenth best progressive rock album ever.|$|E
500|$|In 1837, Holmes was {{appointed}} to the Boston Dispensary, where he was shocked by the poor hygienic conditions. That year he competed for and won both of the Boylston essay prizes. Wishing to concentrate on research and teaching, he, along with three of his peers, established the Tremont Medical School—which would later merge with Harvard Medical School—above an apothecary shop at 35 Tremont Row in Boston. There, he lectured on pathology, taught the use of microscopes, and supervised dissections of cadavers. He often criticized traditional medical practices and once quipped that if all contemporary medicine was tossed into the sea [...] "it would be all <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> mankind—and all the worse for the fishes". For the next ten years, he maintained a small and irregular private medical practice, but spent much of his time teaching. He served on the faculty of Dartmouth Medical School from 1838 to 1840, where he {{was appointed}} professor of anatomy and physiology. For fourteen weeks each fall, during these years, he traveled to Hanover, New Hampshire, to lecture. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1838.|$|E

So it's fitting that she wraps up the deluxe edition with the title track [...] Deep down, she does have a rebel heart— and you can't fault her for reminding us that pop music is all <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> it". Of the leaked demo, Daniel Welsh from The Huffington Post, wrote that [...] "it’s taken the best parts of Avicii’s sound and blended them with Madonna, rather than giving us an ear-assaulting [...] "Avicii feat. Madonna" [...] number about 'putting your drinks up' and 'getting down on the floor'". Spin said it was the singer's [...] "sweetest melody since 'What It Feels Like for a Girl', with her register dropped an octave or two until it resembles the Liz Phair of 2005's (underrated) Somebody's Miracle". Q magazine called it a [...] "movingly autobiographical title track, where Madonna reflects at length on her career and her motivation. It makes you wonder what she thinks she has to prove in 2015 with a song like 'Bitch I'm Madonna' when she proved it all and we’ve been paying attention for years".|$|E

[...] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times called the film an [...] "... earnest, obvious melodrama with no soul, filled with the longing silences that come after a sigh." [...] Mitchell did however laud its cinematography, production design, and musical score, as did the Film Journal Internationals Erica Abeel. Despite praising its visuals, Abeel criticized Girl with a Pearl Earring for being [...] "... a chick flick dressed up in Old Master clothes ..." [...] and for failing [...] "... to render Griet's growing artistic sensibility dramatically credible." [...] She cited its melodramatic villains as another failing, but concluded that it was [...] "... to Johansson's credit that she alone pulls something plausible out of her character." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{was also}} {{pleased with the}} episode, noting that Hermes' and Bender's team-up worked well and that the ending was cathartic. [...] He found the episode to be his {{favorite}} of the new season, giving it a 9/10 and stating, [...] "after an okay start, [...] {{turned out to be}} my favorite episode of this comeback season so far. The more I think about it, the more pleasure I find in it. It was an episode full of laughs, action and the kind of emotional tug the series has been missing of late." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste gave the episode a rating of 8.7/10 and wrote: [...] "Judging from this episode and the last it seems like Futurama is intentionally straying away from its old groupings and trying new things. The sixth season is moving off from the repetition of its first two episodes and is all <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> it." [...] Though he felt the episode was weaker with its jokes, he noted that this [...] "is frequently the case in with episodes that deal more with the characters and less about making jokes in a wacky world. But this isn't something I think will bother real fans, as that's part of what's given Futurama its cult audience in the first place: that the show gives a damn about its characters." ...|$|E

500|$|Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani, Joe Levy of Billboard, and Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone each {{awarded the}} album 3.5 out of 5 stars. Cinquemani {{wrote that the}} album was [...] "all over the map", yet felt it was [...] "a {{surprisingly}} coherent one". Levy wrote that the album was [...] "subtle" [...] compared to [...] "current standards", adding that: [...] "These songs unfold slowly, building through foreplay-like intros before hooks are displayed over a shifting series of textures". Ganz felt that Rebel Heart [...] "is at its strongest when Madonna shoves everyone {{to the side and}} just tells it to us straight", and added: [...] "Deep down, Madonna does have a rebel heart– and you can't fault her for reminding us that pop music is all <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> it". Jamieson Cox of Time commended the album for its consistent production and sound, and for Madonna's vocals and songwriting. Giving it a rating of [...] "B", Kyle Anderson and Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly called the album [...] "Madonna's best outing since 2000's Music". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian and Time Out writer Nick Levine gave the album 3 out of 5 stars. Petridis felt that the two contrasting sides of the album did not [...] "quite gel", reasoning that: [...] "the former might represent the music Madonna wants to make, while the latter is the music she feels obliged to make". Levine wrote: [...] "'Rebel Heart' may lack cohesion, but she's definitely not down for the count: this contains some of the best music Madonna's made in a decade".|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{preferred}} Paltrow's {{return in}} the [...] "Sexy" [...] installment to her initial appearance. The Washington Post Emily Yahr {{felt that she was}} better integrated into this episode, and Raymund Flandez of the Wall Street Journal called her return [...] "infinitely better" [...] than her first appearance: [...] "Back then, she was a puzzle, a loony bin. Here, she's sly and quick-witted, appropriately adult and seductively saucy in an episode that showcased more of her comedic timing, than her stiff dance skills. All <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> us." [...] Fallon wrote that Paltrow was [...] "if possible, even sassier and sultrier" [...] than before, and felt that she served to anchor a busy episode. In contrast, Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly had mixed feelings about Holly and believed that she dominated screen time. VanDerWerff liked Paltrow's acting, but disliked Holly's interaction with Will, saying they lacked [...] "chemistry". Soraya Roberts of the Daily News disliked her return for prolonging Will and Emma's separation, branding Holly a home-wrecker. She commented that while Paltrow's appearance in [...] "The Substitute" [...] was [...] "relatively fresh", in [...] "Sexy" [...] she was [...] "acting almost like a cardboard cutout version of her former self, overly enunciating her lines [...] treading carefully around her choreography". Poniewozik found all of Paltrow's scenes [...] "labored and ridiculous", and wrote that the actress failed to bring an element of realism to her character. Canning said that [...] "the moment she came on screen the whole episode lit up", and the episode was a [...] "fun and funny showcase for everybody's favorite recurring character", and Futterman echoed him when she called Paltrow [...] "our new favorite cast member".|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1880s, Stanford collaborated with the author Gilbert à Beckett on two operas, Savonarola, and The Canterbury Pilgrims. The former was well {{received}} at its premiere in Hamburg in April 1884, but received a critical savaging when staged at Covent Garden in July of the same year. Parry commented privately, [...] "It seems very badly constructed for the stage, poorly conceived and the music, though clean and well-managed, is not striking or dramatic." [...] The most severe public criticism was in The Theatre, whose reviewer wrote, [...] "The book of Savonarola is dull, stilted, and, from a dramatic point of view, weak. It is not, however, so crushingly tiresome as the music fitted to it. Savonarola has gone far to convince me that opera is quite out of [...] line and that the sooner he abandons the stage for the cathedral, <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> his musical reputation." [...] The Canterbury Pilgrims had been premiered in London in April 1884, three months before Savonarola was presented at Covent Garden. It had a better reception than the latter, though reviews pointed out Stanford's debt to Die Meistersinger, and complained of a lack of emotion in the love music. George Grove agreed with the critics, writing to Parry, [...] "Charlie's music contains everything but sentiment. Love not at all – that I heard not a grain of. ... And I do think that there might be more tune. Melody is not a thing to be avoided surely." [...] In 1896 a critic wrote that the opera had [...] "just such a 'book' as would have suited the late Alfred Cellier. He would probably have made of it a charming light English opera. But Dr. Stanford has chosen to use it for the exemplification of those advanced theories which we know him to hold, and he has given us music which would incline us to think that Die Meistersinger had been his model. The effect of the combination is not happy." ...|$|E
