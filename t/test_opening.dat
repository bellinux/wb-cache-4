5|$|During the drawn Third <b>Test,</b> <b>opening</b> batsman Sid Barnes was injured. This {{opened up}} a vacancy for the Fourth Test. Hamence made 30 as Australia {{defeated}} Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match before the Fourth Test at Headingley. Hamence was overlooked for the vacancy as Harvey was called in. Australia scored 3/404 to set a world record for the highest successful Test run chase; Harvey scored a century.|$|E
5|$|Hammond toured South Africa in {{the winter}} of 1930–31, in a weak M.C.C. side without some of the best English players. The {{tourists}} were short of opening batsmen, frequently forcing Hammond into the role. Although successful, he brought a more wary approach than usual to his unaccustomed position. In all first-class cricket, he scored 1,045 runs (average 61.47). In the five-Test series, which South Africa won 1–0, he scored 517 runs (average 64.62), passing fifty five times in nine innings. A very cautious approach batting at number three saw Hammond score 49 and 63 in the first <b>Test.</b> <b>Opening</b> the batting in the second Test, he scored two fifties to save the game; he also kept wicket for a time following an injury to the regular wicketkeeper. Hammond continued to open in the third Test, playing more aggressively for 136 not out, before returning to number three and making 75 in the fourth Test. In the final Test, he opened both the batting and the bowling.|$|E

Keijzer made her One Day International (ODI) debut at the 1988 World Cup in Australia.

The second tour match against Mumbai A saw Compton open the batting with his rival for the <b>Test</b> <b>opening</b> spot Joe Root. Compton scored just one run in the first innings, but {{completed}} his first half century for England in the second innings, as he finished 64 not out. In {{the third and final}} tour match against Haryana, Compton completed half centuries in both innings of the match making 74 and 79 respectively, which included a 166-run opening partnership with Alastair Cook in the first innings.|$|E

25|$|On the tour, {{his modest}} returns {{in the state}} matches {{and the success of}} the <b>Test</b> <b>opening</b> bowlers Peter Pollock and Joe Partridge with medium-pace support from Trevor Goddard and Eddie Barlow kept him out of the Test side until the Third Test. He took two wickets in that drawn match, then three wickets in the Fourth Test in Adelaide, when he took the match-winning wicket in his best Test figures of 3 for 50 in the second innings. He took one wicket in the Fifth Test, but the {{selectors}} returned to the four-man pace attack in the three subsequent Tests in New Zealand.

25|$|An Old Xaverian, Plant was {{initially}} an Australian rules footballer {{and played a}} senior match for Victorian Football League club Richmond in the 1925 VFL season. Richmond lost the fixture, which {{took place at the}} Melbourne Cricket Ground, to Melbourne by 39 points. He couldn't break into Richmond's team again and instead continued his football career at Coburg, where he played as a centre half back in their 1928 premiership side. Plant completed his football career in the 1929 season and in 1930 moved to the Fitzroy Baseball Club to begin a distinguished career as a baseballer. One of the leading Fitzroy baseballers at this time was the <b>Test</b> <b>opening</b> batsman, W. H. Ponsford. In his first season playing baseball Plant was mentioned as a valuable player and in 1938 and 1939 he captained the Victorian baseball team for the Claxton shield, the interstate baseball competition.|$|E
25|$|This was {{followed}} by a match against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's, which fielded a virtual England Test team. Seven of the MCC's representatives went on to play in the First Test, while three others had already had Test experience, including former national captain Freddie Brown, so it was an opportunity to gain a psychological advantage in what amounted to a rehearsal for the Ashes. The first day's play was entire washed out by rain, leaving a bowler-friendly surface when the match started on the following morning. Miller bowled seven wicketless overs, conceding only ten runs, before Doug Ring took over and claimed five wickets as the MCC were dismissed for 80. Miller was then bowled by Trevor Bailey for a duck as the tourists slumped to 4/26 before recovering to take a 99-run first innings lead. In the second innings, Miller took the wickets of English <b>Test</b> <b>opening</b> batsmen, Reg Simpson and David Sheppard, trapping his victims leg before wicket and bowled respectively, to leave the hosts at 2/15 just before stumps on the second day. He later removed Fred Brown and Godfrey Evans in the middle-order, to end with 4/47, as the MCC made 196. The last two wickets came from deliberately unconventional balls, a full toss and a round arm delivery that were designed to surprise his opponents. This left Australia with a target of 98 for victory, but they had only reached 2/13 when time ran out. Miller was not required to bat.|$|E

500|$|Years later, Barnes {{wrote about}} the effect this had on his batting style. There was one angle about this change of batting {{position}} that didn't appeal to me. I am, by nature, a forcing batsman. I like to take the shine out of a bowler [...] and I love to hear the ball rattling the pickets, or soaring over the fence... My footwork was quick and I often caused delight by stepping back feet outside the leg stump and square-cutting... If I were to become an Australian <b>Test</b> <b>opening</b> batsman I would have to conform to standard. I would {{have to put up}} the shutters...

500|$|On {{the basis}} of his form, Larwood was an obvious choice for the MCC touring side that Chapman took to Australia in the English winter of 1928–29. In an early game against Victoria he took 7 for 51 in the state's first innings and scored 79 when MCC batted. One of his victims in the match was Bill Ponsford, the Australian <b>Test</b> <b>opening</b> batsman, who let slip his opinion that Larwood was [...] "not really fast". According to the {{journalist}} and future Australian Test player Jack Fingleton, Ponsford was then targeted by Larwood. A month later at Brisbane, in the first Test of the series, Larwood dismissed him cheaply, twice; in the second Test, at Sydney, Ponsford scored 5 before a rapid delivery from Larwood broke a bone in his hand; Ponsford did not play again that summer.|$|E

He was widely regarded as an instrumental component in Australia's rise to Test cricket dominance, and his captaincy was regarded as adventurous and highly effective.

Ponting scored 55 in an Australian innings victory, before many sections of the media attacked the West Indies lack-lustre performance. Ponting produced scores of 35 and 20 in the following Test in Adelaide, as the touring side responded to their critics by securing a draw. For {{the first time since}} 2002, Ponting slid out of the top ten Test batting rankings—dropping to 12th—as Australia faced the prospect of falling to third in the team rankings if they were not able to achieve victory in the final Test of the series.
