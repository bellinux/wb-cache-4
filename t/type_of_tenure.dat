40|$|Although often overlooked, {{land tenure}} is an {{important}} variable impacting on vulnerability to disaster. Vulnerability can occur either where land tenure {{is perceived to be}} insecure, or where insecure tenure results in the loss of land, especially when alternative livelihood and housing options are limited. Disasters often provide the catalyst for such loss. This paper avoids making generalisations about the security <b>of</b> particular <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenure,</b> but instead explores factors that mediate tenure security, particularly {{in the wake of a}} disaster. The paper identifies five mediating factors: (1) the local legal system; (2) government administrative authority; (3) the economy; (4) evidence <b>of</b> <b>tenure,</b> and; (5) custom and dominant social attitudes. It is shown that some mediating factors are more salient for particular <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> than others. The paper will highlight the importance <b>of</b> land <b>tenure</b> in any assessment of vulnerability, and conclude with suggestions for further research...|$|R

5000|$|Permanent rector is an {{obsolete}} {{term used}} in the United States prior to the codification of the 1917 Code of Canon Law. Canon Law grants a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> to pastors (...) of parishes, giving them certain rights against arbitrary removal by the bishop of their diocese. In order to preserve their flexibility and authority in assigning priests to parishes, bishops in the United States until that time did not actually appoint priests as pastors, but as [...] "permanent rectors" [...] of their parishes: the [...] "permanent" [...] gave the priest a degree {{of confidence in the}} security in his assignment, but the [...] "rector" [...] rather than [...] "pastor" [...] preserved the bishop's absolute authority to reassign clergy. Hence, many older parishes list among their early leaders priests with the postnominal letters [...] "P.R." [...] (as in, a plaque listing all of the pastors of a parish, with [...] "Rev. John Smith, P.R."). This practice was discontinued and today priests are normally assigned as pastors of parishes, and bishops in practice reassign them at will (though there are still questions about the canonical legality of this).|$|E
40|$|Ghana {{has three}} {{dominant}} modes of housing tenure: owner occupancy, renting and rent free. Rent free {{has been a}} substantial tenure mode in Ghana over the years. It was the major <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> in the country before 1998 when it became the next major <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> after owning (GSS, 2005). This study aims at estimating the determinants of the housing tenure decisions in Ghana. it employed the multinomial logit model to achieve this objective. It was found that a household’s decision to rent is positively influenced by location in the forest and coastal ecological zones, urban location, a household head with basic education and the income of the household head. Location in the forest ecological zone, urban location, household heads with bachelor’s degrees and employed household heads are the main positive determinants {{of the decision to}} stay rent free. Rent free, as a tenure choice is substantial and serves young graduates; the state should therefore make deliberate efforts to sustain and maintain the extended family system, since it is the major provider of rent free housing units in Ghana 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} years, {{the energy crisis}} has {{become more and more}} serious and needs to be paid more {{attention}} to accordingly. Residential sector building energy consumption uses {{a large portion of the}} Total National Energy Consumption (TNEC) all over the world. Energy consumption in residential buildings is dependent on building characteristics and occupants’ behaviour. To investigate the interaction between human behavior and the related electricity consumption, a quantitative research was conducted on a sample of 117 residents of three condominiums in The Klang Valley. The socio-demographic factors towards electricity consumption and the effect of awareness on electricity consumption were then investigated by statistical analysis. The analysis revealed that out of seven introduced independent variables (age, race, gender, monthly income, Education, Number of people staying at home and <b>Type</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tenure),</b> only income and number of people living in the house could significantly and positively contribute to electricity consumption. A model was suggested according to the regression analysis of the results. It was also shown that unlike the previous studies, there was no significance relationship between the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> and electricity consumption. Finally the positive effect of electricity awareness on electricity consumption is shown by fee results. The comparison between the multistorey local residents’ patterns and styles of living and their relative electricity consumption with the overseas’ people might enlighten many views towards sustainable behavioural living...|$|E

40|$|During {{the late}} 1980 s/early 1990 s, {{voluntary}} forest certification {{emerged as a}} new market-based incentive mechanism and had an important influence {{on the way the}} world's forests are managed. To understand the mechanism of its diffusion, we employed a survey instrument and probit regression analysis to investigate certification of forest practices by Canadian companies. Specifically, we investigated the characteristics of firms that have considered certification and of firms that have formally manifested their intention to certify. Three major forest certification schemes are considered: (1) ISO 14001, (2) the Canadian Standards Association, and (3) the Forest Stewardship Council. We find that a firm's <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> holdings, reliance on export markets, size, and the local community are important factors in explaining why forest companies consider certification...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the housing demand in Spain according to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> (rental or purchase) and building (single family or multifamily), based on microeconometric data from 1999. Our approach uses a generalization of the two-stage Heckman estimation to correct the bias of the sample selection, with a mixed logit multinomial model in the first stage. The results obtained show differences in the housing demand between owners and renters according to the building type, with larger values of income elasticity and demand price in rented dwellings. Furthermore, the differences between our results and those of earlier well-known papers that deal with the U. S. and U. K. housing markets appear to be due to differences between the housing markets, and do not stem from differences in econometric specification. ...|$|E
