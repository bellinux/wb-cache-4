500|$|Each state applies varying {{standards}} {{in regards to}} determining whether a game is one of skill, or of chance; in most states, this determination is based on whether the skill-based elements of the game are predominant over those of chance, and whether these chance-based elements have more than an incidental effect {{on the outcome of}} the game (dominant factor <b>test,</b> <b>material</b> degree). Some states use stricter criteria, under which games whose outcomes are influenced by any element of chance, or appeal to a [...] "gambling instinct", are considered games of chance, regardless of the presence of skill-based elements. In the state of Illinois, any game played for cash where the players are not the [...] "actual contestants" [...] in a [...] "bona fide contest for the determination of skill, speed, strength, or endurance", constitutes gambling.|$|E

50|$|Active {{thermography}} is {{an advanced}} nondestructive testing procedure, {{which uses a}} thermography measurement of a <b>tested</b> <b>material</b> thermal response after its external excitation. This principle can be used also for non-contact infrared non-destructive <b>testing</b> (IRNDT) of <b>materials.</b> The IRNDT method {{is based on an}} excitation of a <b>tested</b> <b>material</b> by an external source, which brings some energy to the material. Halogen lamps, flash-lamps, ultrasound generator or other sources can be used as the excitation source for the IRNDT. The excitation causes a <b>tested</b> <b>material</b> thermal response, which is measured by an infrared camera. It is possible to obtain information about the <b>tested</b> <b>material</b> surface and sub-surface defects or material inhomogeneities by using a suitable combination of excitation source, excitation procedure, infrared camera and evaluation method.|$|R
500|$|As {{in earlier}} periods, {{the focus of}} the {{examination}} was classical Confucian texts, while the bulk of <b>test</b> <b>material</b> centered on the Four Books outlined by Zhu Xi in the 12th century. Ming era examinations were perhaps more difficult to pass since the 1487 requirement of completing the [...] "eight-legged essay", a departure from basing essays off progressing literary trends. The exams increased in difficulty as the student progressed from the local level, and appropriate titles were accordingly awarded successful applicants. Officials were classified in nine hierarchic grades, each grade divided into two degrees, with ranging salaries (nominally paid in piculs of rice) according to their rank. While provincial graduates who were appointed to office were immediately assigned to low-ranking posts like the county graduates, those who passed the palace examination were awarded a jinshi ('presented scholar') degree and assured a high-level position. In 276 years of Ming rule and ninety palace examinations, the number of doctoral degrees granted by passing the palace examinations was 24,874. Ebrey states that [...] "there were only two to four thousand of these jinshi at any given time, on the order of one out of 10,000 adult males." [...] This was in comparison to the 100,000 shengyuan ('government students'), the lowest tier of graduates, by the 16th century.|$|E

[...] The same statement quotes their president as saying, [...] "The CPA's concern is not with the publication of the cards and responses to the Rorschach test per se, for which there is some controversy in the psychological literature and disagreement among experts, but with the larger issue of the publication and dissemination of psychological test content".|$|E
2500|$|Visual {{effects for}} the film were {{completed}} by Sony Pictures Imageworks, Method Studios, Luma Pictures, Digital Domain, Cantina Creative, Iloura, Trixter, and Industrial Light & Magic. Executive producer Victoria Alonso initially did not want Imageworks, who worked on all previous Spider-Man films, to work on Homecoming {{in order to have}} a different look. She eventually changed her mind after seeing [...] "phenomenal" [...] <b>test</b> <b>material</b> from the vendor. Digital Domain worked on the Staten Island Ferry battle, creating the CGI versions of Spider-Man and the first Vulture suit, Iron Man, and Spider-Man's emblem drone, Dronie. Digital Domain was able to LIDAR an actual Staten Island Ferry, as well as the version created on set, to help with creating their digital version. They also created Iron Man for when he confronts Parker after the battle. Lou Pecora, visual effects supervisor at Digital Domain, called that sequence [...] "brutal" [...] because [...] "the way they were shot, it was lit to be a certain time of day, and afterwards it was decided to change that time of day." [...] Sony Pictures Imageworks created much of the third act of the film, when Parker confronts Toomes on the plane and beach in his homemade suit and Toomes is in his upgraded Vulture suit. Some elements from Vulture's first suit were shared with Imageworks, but the remainder was created by them based off a maquete. For the plane's cloaking ability, Imageworks based what they created off the real world Adaptiv IR Camouflage tank cloaking system from BAE Systems, which uses a series of titles to cloak against infrared. For their web design, which was based on the one created for Civil War, Digital Domain referenced polar bear hair because of its translucent nature. Imageworks, who also looked to the Civil War webs, referenced the webs they had created for previous Spider-Man films, in which the webs had tiny barbs that aided in hooking on to things, by dialing back the barbs and referencing the other web designs created {{for the film}}. Method Studios worked on the Washington Monument sequence.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two basic}} {{components}} in an EMAT transducer. One is a magnet {{and the other is}} an electric coil. The magnet can be a permanent magnet or an electromagnet, which produces a static or a quasi-static magnetic field. In EMAT terminology, this field is called bias magnetic field. The electric coil is driven with an alternating current (AC) electric signal at ultrasonic frequency, typically in the range from 20 kHz to 10 MHz. Based on the application needs, the signal can be a continuous wave, a spike pulse, or a tone-burst signal. The electric coil with AC current also generates an AC magnetic field. When the <b>test</b> <b>material</b> is close to the EMAT, ultrasonic waves are generated in the <b>test</b> <b>material</b> through the interaction of the two magnetic fields.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This article {{deals with}} {{studying}} {{the relationships among}} the chemical composition, microstructure and properties (hardness, micro-hardness, wear resistance) of powder additives based on NiCrBSi after their deposition. <b>Tested</b> <b>materials</b> reached a relatively wide range of hardness after deposition, which corresponds to their chemical composition and microstructure. The abrasive wear resistance of <b>materials</b> was <b>tested</b> on an emery cloth. The results indicate that both the hardness and abrasive wear resistance of <b>tested</b> <b>materials</b> depend especially {{on the content of}} carbon and chromium. Microstructural analysis indicates that the structure of <b>tested</b> <b>materials</b> is formed by the Î³-Ni solid solution and intermediate phases based on boron, silicon and carbon. Those mostly form eutectics (three types), or are excluded by precipitation. There was also found a significant effect of chromium, but especially carbon content on the ratio between the solid solution and eutectics in the microstructure of <b>tested</b> <b>materials.</b> These different ratios of solid solution and eutectics were markedly reflected in micro-hardness behaviours in deposited layers. Micro-hardness values confirmed also the presence of carbidic particles in the layers with carbon content higher than 0. 7 wt%...|$|R
