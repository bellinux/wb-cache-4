5|$|A Momentary Lapse of Reason is {{the thirteenth}} studio album by English {{progressive}} rock band Pink Floyd, {{released in the}} UK and US on 7 September 1987, on the labels EMI and Columbia. It followed guitarist David Gilmour's decision to include material recorded for his third solo album on a new Pink Floyd album with drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright. Although for legal reasons Wright could not be re-admitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>band,</b> Wright and Mason helped Gilmour craft what became the first Pink Floyd album since the December 1985 departure of bass guitarist, singer, and primary songwriter Roger Waters.|$|E
5|$|Akshaya: The name {{originates}} from Hindi (specifically Sanskrit) {{and signifies}} “the indomitable”. Akshaya is a female character {{with a firm}} personality, and belongs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> although she often acts as an antepole in regard to Costello. In a certain sense she represents the matriarchal form of governance by daring to disagree with the alpha and making her own decisions.|$|E
5|$|Bloc Party {{commissioned}} Silent Alarm Remixed to {{show that}} remixes and dance music were relevant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> and to the rock landscape at large. The band members gave each of the original tracks {{to a number of}} musicians from different genres; Ladytron, Four Tet, and Nick Zinner were amongst those who reworked the songs. Critics often considered the record as showcasing the potential high quality of remix albums, although some reviewers treated it as disjunct and a poor marketing decision.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>band</b> members pursued {{different}} musical {{directions and}} contributed new influences <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>band's</b> sound. Yoni Rechter turned to progressive rock {{and was a}} member of the progressive rock duo 14 Octaves (along with Avner Kener) at the time. Efrahim Shamir and Alon Olearthick turned <b>to</b> jazz. <b>The</b> result was <b>the</b> <b>band's</b> most diversified album, but this cost <b>the</b> <b>band</b> many fans and finally led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>band's</b> break-up in 1976.|$|R
5000|$|Comparing <b>the</b> record <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>band's</b> {{previous}} album, Yui Mizuno explained <b>the</b> <b>band's</b> challenge {{toward more}} music genres than before, {{as well as}} the inclusion of more positive lyrics. With <b>the</b> desire <b>to</b> send messages <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fans, <b>the</b> <b>band</b> also recorded a song in English, specifically [...] "The One". As a result, more people would get <b>to</b> listen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>band's</b> music. In a Loudwire interview, Moa Kikuchi described her experiences and feelings toward their sophomore release.|$|R

5|$|Curtis Silver, in a {{retrospective}} for Wired, collected anecdotes from They Might Be Giants fans, {{many of whom}} were first exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> through Flood. Silver concluded that new fans are drawn just as much to the band's old material as they are their more recent work, due to its sustaining accessibility. In fact, many fans cite the band's earliest albums as their favorites—though often not Flood, despite (or perhaps due to) its longstanding mainstream success.|$|E
5|$|During his {{backstage}} theatre job, Sellers began practising {{on a set}} {{of drums}} that belonged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> Joe Daniels and his Hot Shots. Daniels noticed his efforts and gave him practical instructions. The instrument greatly suited Sellers's temperament and artistic skills. Spike Milligan later noted that Sellers was very proficient on the drums and might have remained a jazz drummer, had he lacked his skills in mimicry and improvisation.|$|E
5|$|Fall Out Boy {{have been}} {{instrumental}} in the careers of other artists, such as Panic! at the Disco, whom Pete Wentz signed to his record label, Decaydance Records, in late 2004. Several artists, such as You Me at Six and Taylor Swift, have created or performed covers of Fall Out Boy songs as a homage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>band.</b>|$|E

5|$|For {{several days}} Frusciante and Kiedis {{worked on the}} song, and it {{became one of the}} few tracks written and {{completed}} prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> moving into The Mansion where they recorded the album. After the song was recorded, Rubin felt the grand and epic outro would benefit from a large group of singers. Frusciante invited his mother, Gail, and her friends, all of whom sang in a choir, to perform.|$|E
5|$|Guitarist Kerry King {{wrote the}} {{majority}} of the lyrics, taking a different approach from earlier recordings by exploring topics such as religion, murder, revenge and self-control. He limited the lyrics to realistic subject matter most could relate <b>to.</b> <b>The</b> <b>band</b> experimented, recording most of the album in C# tuning, with three songs in drop B and two others with seven-string guitars in B♭. The album's release was delayed due to the explicit cover artwork which led to alternative slip covers in some retail outlets, difficulties during audio mixing and a change of distributor for the band's record label, American.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Kappa Kappa Psi Grand President Hugh McMillen {{began the}} Commissioning Program to add new music <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> repertoire, {{beginning}} with a $500 commission of Don Gillis, who provided Ballet for Band for the NIB. The Commissioning Program is now the longest-running commissioning program for wind band music in American history, and has produced works that have secured {{a place in the}} emerging band canon and have garnered critical acclaim, such as Robert Russell Bennett's Symphonic Songs for Band and Karel Husa's Concerto for Trumpet and Wind Orchestra.|$|E

5000|$|One {{review of}} <b>the</b> album alludes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>band's</b> silliness by making several {{marijuana}} related puns, while {{a writer for}} Tucson Weekly mentions how <b>the</b> <b>band</b> created [...] "this wild musical world teeming with seedy characters," [...] and compared Hang Glider <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>band's</b> first album calling it [...] "darker, more subversive and {{a heck of a}} lot longer, although the sense of humor is still intact." ...|$|R
5|$|In 2009, Homme {{appeared}} alongside Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones in {{the band}} Them Crooked Vultures. The band has so far put out one record, the self-titled Them Crooked Vultures.

5|$|In late 2016, Zac Baird {{left the}} live band after 10 years, amidst {{conflicts}} between {{his wife and}} Munky's wife over Instagram. Jules Venturini completed the tour before Davey Oberlin was brought in <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>band.</b> It was later announced that Fieldy would be missing Korn's tour of South America and Robert Trujillo's (The Bassist of Metallica) son, Tye (who was 12 at the time) {{was brought in to}} perform with the band {{for the duration of the}} tour.|$|E
5|$|Initial rumors {{suggested}} that Cornell {{took issue with}} having two managers {{actively involved in the}} project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine). According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>band,</b> however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing to alternate who released the band's albums.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>band's</b> {{dissatisfaction with}} <b>the</b> way CBS was {{marketing}} them, along with differences between <b>the</b> <b>band</b> members, led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>band's</b> demise in late 1984.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, Gurango left <b>the</b> <b>band</b> <b>to</b> lead <b>the</b> cover <b>band</b> Little Green Men, before forming Mojofly.

Later albums included artwork by collaborating artists: Ænima and Salival featured works by Cam de Leon; Lateralus and 10,000 Days were created with the help of Alex Grey. The releases garnered positive critical reception, with a music journalist of the Associated Press attributing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> a reputation for innovative album packaging.|$|E
