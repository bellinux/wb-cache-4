500|$|When it came {{to writing}} [...] "Happy Working Song", Menken and Schwartz were {{directly}} influenced by the song [...] "Whistle While You Work" [...] from Disney's first full-length animated feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), with Schwartz describing [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] as a [...] "spoof" [...] and [...] "one of the funniest sequences of the film". According to Schwartz, [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] was written rather quickly, having come [...] " [...] really fast". Schwartz elaborated, [...] "'Happy Working Song' is... pretty much out of Snow White and 'Whistle While You Work' and that little thing where they do the dishes and Dopey with the soap bubbles and everything." [...] In addition to this, [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] features references to both the musical number [...] "The Work Song" [...] and [...] "the busy little mice" [...] from Disney's Cinderella (1950), but to a significantly lesser extent. Lyrically, Schwartz decided to approach the song comically as demonstrated by its phrase [...] "Even <b>though</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> vermin." ...|$|E
500|$|The ancient epic of the Indian subcontinent, the Mahabharata of Vyasa, {{contains}} two pivotal moments of conscience. The first {{occurs when the}} warrior Arjuna being overcome with compassion against killing his opposing relatives in war, receives counsel (see Bhagavad-Gita) from Krishna about his spiritual duty ("work as <b>though</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> performing a sacrifice for the general good"). The second, {{at the end of}} the saga, is when king Yudhishthira having alone survived the moral tests of life, is offered eternal bliss, only to refuse it because a faithful dog is prevented from coming with him by purported divine rules and laws. The French author Montaigne (1533–1592) in one of the most celebrated of his essays ("On experience") expressed the benefits of living with a clear conscience: [...] "Our duty is to compose our character, not to compose books, to win not battles and provinces, but order and tranquillity in our conduct. Our great and glorious masterpiece is to live properly". In his famous Japanese travel journal Oku no Hosomichi (Narrow Road to the Deep North) composed of mixed haiku poetry and prose, Matsuo Basho (1644–94) in attempting to describe the eternal in this perishable world is often moved in conscience; for example by a thicket of summer grass being all that remains of the dreams and ambitions of ancient warriors. Chaucer's [...] "Franklin's Tale" [...] in The Canterbury Tales recounts how a young suitor releases a wife from a rash promise because of the respect in his conscience for the freedom to be truthful, gentle and generous.|$|E
2500|$|If {{you were}} going to issue an order, [...] "I am going to collect head money upon all of you people, both adults and children," [...] they would {{certainly}} remonstrate loudly and angrily against you. However, if you take firm control over the policy on salt, the people cannot manage to dodge it even <b>though</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going to take a profit of one hundred times over.” ...|$|E

6000|$|Sir Eric, meanwhile, thundered {{forth in}} his Norman patois, [...] "I {{would have you}} to know, young Sir, Prince <b>though</b> <b>you</b> <b>be,</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> our prisoner, and shall taste of a dungeon, and bread and water, unless you behave yourself." ...|$|R
2500|$|Asked {{whether he}} invests in stocks, he replied, [...] "Not as much these days. I {{used to have}} a lot in equities—about 75%—but over the past three years, I’ve had about 95% in cash and 5% in equities. You’re not getting much from savings these days but earning 0% is better than losing 50%[...] [...] [...] I don’t believe in picking {{individual}} stocks or assets[...] [...] [...] Never invest your money as <b>though</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> gambling at the casino. Buying and selling individual stocks is a waste of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|I was {{operated}} on that afternoon. As soon as I woke the surgeon, John Bartlett, {{was sitting on}} the end of my bed to tell me the bi-op was malignant... John found it hard to tell me and I found it hard to accept... I had to ring Mum and Dad in Deniliquin to tell them there was some bad news. Somehow you float through it even <b>though</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> scared s---less... The hardest part is the initial part, once you know what's in front of you it gets better. I don't want to trivialise cancer in any way. You have to let the emotion out then sit down and become realistic ... I never asked if my life was in the balance. My parents taught me, my school taught me, sport taught me but in particular cancer taught me that trust is the most powerful emotion we have. I trusted my doctors and nurses implicitly. It was amazing what I learnt about the power of the mind and how important trust is... There were the [...] "how in the hell did I get it?" [...] moments. No one knows, it could have been getting hit in a footy game or a cricket ball 10 years earlier.|$|E
