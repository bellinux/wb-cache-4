He steals clothes and evades the police. The Terminator begins {{systematically}} killing women named Sarah Connor, whose addresses he finds in the <b>telephone</b> <b>directory.</b> He tracks the last Sarah Connor to a nightclub, but Kyle rescues her. The pair steal a car and escape with the Terminator pursuing them in a police car.|$|E
25|$|A <b>{{telephone}}</b> <b>directory</b> is {{a listing}} of telephone subscribers in a geographical area or subscribers to services provided by the organization that publishes the directory. R.

25|$|The first Anglo settler, John J. Thompson, {{moved to}} Oak Creek Canyon in 1876, an area {{well known for}} its peach and apple orchards. The early {{settlers}} were farmers and ranchers. In 1902, when the Sedona post office was established, there were 55 residents. In the mid-1950s, the first <b>telephone</b> <b>directory</b> listed 155 names. Some parts of the Sedona area were not electrified until the 1960s.|$|E

The most straightforward type of frame {{is a list of}} elements of the population (preferably the entire population) with appropriate contact information. For example, in an opinion poll, possible sampling frames include an electoral register and a <b>telephone</b> <b>directory.</b>|$|E

25|$|Because {{numbers were}} {{different}} for every exchange, callers either had to dial the operator or {{look up the}} telephone number. An example of this was Auckland, New Zealand before the introduction of 111 in the 1960s – the city had 40 exchanges, all with different emergency numbers, and finding the telephone number for the local exchange would require having to search through the city's 500-page <b>telephone</b> <b>directory.</b>|$|E
25|$|Irala's {{rule set}} {{the pattern for}} Paraguay's {{internal}} affairs until Independence. In addition to the Spaniards, Asunción's population included immigrants, mostly men, from present-day France, Italy, Germany, England, and Portugal. This community of about 350 chose wives and concubines from Guaraní women. Irala had 70 concubines (his surname fills several pages in the Asunción <b>telephone</b> <b>directory).</b> He encouraged his men to marry Indian women and give up thoughts of returning to Spain. Paraguay soon became a colony of mestizos. Continued arrivals of Europeans resulted in development of a criollo elite.|$|E
25|$|Although {{aware that}} he was a {{potential}} IRA assassination target, Gow declined to take anything more than routine security precautions. Unlike most British MPs of that era, he left his telephone number and home address in the local <b>telephone</b> <b>directory.</b> In the early hours of 30 July 1990, a bomb was planted under Gow's Austin Montego car, which was parked in the driveway of his house in Hankham, near Pevensey in East Sussex. The 4½-lb Semtex bomb detonated at 08:39 as Gow reversed out of his driveway, leaving him with severe wounds to his lower body. He died ten minutes later.|$|E

25|$|Systematic {{sampling}} (also {{known as}} interval sampling) relies on arranging {{the study population}} according to some ordering scheme and then selecting elements at regular intervals through that ordered list. Systematic sampling involves a random start and then proceeds with the selection of every kth element from then onwards. In this case, k=(population size/sample size). It {{is important that the}} starting point is not automatically the first in the list, but is instead randomly chosen from within the first to the kth element in the list. A simple example would be to select every 10th name from the <b>telephone</b> <b>directory</b> (an 'every 10th' sample, also referred to as 'sampling with a skip of 10').|$|E
500|$|The role of Quatermass was {{featured}} in three influential BBC science fiction serials of the 1950s, and again in a final serial for Thames Television in 1979. A remake of the first serial appeared on BBC Four in 2005. [...] The character also appeared in films, {{on the radio and}} in print over a fifty-year period.

Clarke had tried to lead a normal life away from filming, she even left her home phone number in the <b>telephone</b> <b>directory.</b> She was forced to change her number after fans repeatedly rang her asking how Frank was and what would happen next in their storyline.|$|E
500|$|Rudolph Cartier, {{one of the}} BBC's best-regarded directors, {{directed}} the serial. He and Kneale had collaborated on the play Arrow to the Heart, and worked closely on the initial storyline to make it suit the television production methods of the time. Kneale claimed to have picked his leading character's unusual last name at random from a London <b>telephone</b> <b>directory.</b> He chose the character's first name, Bernard, in honour of astronomer Bernard Lovell. The working titles for the production were The Unbegotten and Bring Something Back...!, the latter a line of dialogue in the second episode. Kneale had not finished scripting the final two episodes of the serial before the first episode was transmitted. The production had an overall budget of just under £4000. The theme music used was [...] "Mars, Bringer of War" [...] from Gustav Holst's The Planets.|$|E
500|$|The science-fiction {{production}} to which Jacobs referred was The Quatermass Experiment, broadcast in six half-hour episodes in July and August 1953. The serial {{told the story}} of Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Experimental Rocket Group, and the consequences of his sending the first manned mission into space when a terrible fate befalls the crew and only one returns. The Quatermass Experiment was the first adult television science-fiction production, held a large television audience gripped across its six weeks, and has been described by the Museum of Broadcast Communications as dramatising [...] "a new range of gendered fears about Britain's postwar and post-colonial security." [...] Kneale was inspired in choosing the character's unusual surname by the fact that many Manx surnames began with [...] "Qu"; the actual name itself was picked from a London <b>telephone</b> <b>directory.</b> The Professor's first name was chosen in honour of the astronomer Bernard Lovell.|$|E

500|$|He {{was elected}} {{a member of}} the International Astronomical Union in 1966; having twice edited the Union's General Assembly newsletters. He {{attempted}} to establish an International Union of Amateur Astronomers, which failed due to lack of interest. During the 1970s and 80s, he reported on the Voyager and Pioneer programs, often from NASA headquarters. At this time he became increasingly annoyed by conspiracy theorists and reporters who asked him questions such as [...] "Why waste money on space research when {{there is so much to}} be done here?". He said that when asked these type of questions [...] "I know that I'm dealing with an idiot." [...] Another question that annoyed him was [...] "what is the difference between astronomy and astrology?" [...] Despite this he made a point of responding to all letters delivered to his house, and sent a variety of standard replies to letters asking basic questions, as well as those from conspiracy theorists, proponents of hunting and 'cranks'. Despite his fame, his telephone number was always listed in the <b>telephone</b> <b>directory</b> and he was happy to show members of the public his observatory.|$|E
500|$|Core Design, a {{subsidiary}} of Eidos, created Lara Croft as the lead protagonist of its video game Tomb Raider, which began development in 1993. Lead graphic artist Toby Gard went through about five designs before arriving at the character's final appearance. He initially envisioned a male lead character with a whip and a hat. Core Design co-founder Jeremy Smith characterised the design as derivative of Indiana Jones, and asked for more originality. Gard decided that a female character would work better from a design standpoint. He also {{expressed a desire to}} counter stereotypical female characters, which he has characterised as [...] "bimbos" [...] or [...] "dominatrix" [...] types. Smith was sceptical of a female lead at first because few contemporary games featured them. He came to regard a female lead as a great hook and put faith in Gard's idea. Inspired by pop artist Neneh Cherry and comic book character Tank Girl, Gard experimented with different designs, including a muscular woman and a Nazi-like militant. He settled on a tough South American woman with a braid named Laura Cruz. Eidos management preferred a more [...] "UK friendly" [...] name, and selected Lara Croft from similar-sounding British names found in an English <b>telephone</b> <b>directory.</b> Along with the name change, the character's backstory was altered to incorporate a British origin.|$|E
