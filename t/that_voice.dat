5|$|In 2013, Beyoncé {{made the}} Time 100 list, with Baz Luhrmann writing: No one has <b>that</b> <b>voice,</b> no one moves {{the way she}} moves, no one can hold an {{audience}} the way she does... When Beyoncé does an album, when Beyoncé sings a song, when Beyoncé does anything, it's an event, and it's broadly influential. Right now, she is the heir-apparent diva of the USA – the reigning national voice. In 2014, Beyoncé was listed again on the Time 100 and also featured {{on the cover of}} the issue.|$|E
5|$|Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch, a {{linguist}} and cartographer at the Smithsonian who {{was recruited}} to decipher The Shepherd's Journal while directing {{an expedition to}} Atlantis. Kirk Wise, one of the directors, said that they chose Fox for the role because they felt he gave his character his own personality and made them more believable on screen. Fox said <b>that</b> <b>voice</b> acting was much easier than his past experience with live action {{because he did not}} have to worry about what he looked like in front of a camera while delivering his lines. The directors mentioned that Fox was also offered a role for Titan A.E.; he allowed his son to choose which film he would work on, and he chose Atlantis. Viewers have noted similarities between Milo and the film's language consultant, Marc Okrand, who developed the Atlantean language used in the film. Okrand stated that Milo's supervising animator, John Pomeroy, sketched him, claiming not to know how a linguist looked or acted.|$|E

25|$|Curtin {{formed a}} close working {{relationship}} with the Allied Supreme Commander in the South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur. Curtin realised that Australia would be ignored unless it had a strong voice in Washington, D.C., and he wanted <b>that</b> <b>voice</b> to be MacArthur's. He gave over control of Australian forces to MacArthur, directing Australian commanders to treat MacArthur's orders as if {{they came from the}} Australian Government.|$|E
25|$|In 1962 {{he became}} the PA voice for the Houston Astros. He was also the public address {{announcer}} for Rice University sporting events. He announced many games {{over the years and}} he became well known for his way of announcing “Jose Cruuuuuuz.” “ is the one to come out with the way they announced my name.” Jose Cruz commented. Once Duckett said: “Strangers are always telling me, 'I've heard <b>that</b> <b>voice.</b> I just don't know where.” In 1992 he left the Astros.|$|E
25|$|During this election, {{political}} parties used technology in {{innovative ways to}} reach out to the voters. Although SMS had been used during prior elections, {{political parties}} had realised that the rural and illiterate voters which form a majority couldn't read. Young and technology savvy politicians quickly realised <b>that</b> <b>voice</b> was the way {{to reach out to}} the rural community as they could speak their language. This turned out to be very interesting as two voice companies from India, TringMe and VoiceHawk played the pivotal role in reaching out to the billion people of India.|$|E

25|$|The {{administration}} initially {{denied the}} union recognition. While the university discouraged {{the formation of}} labor unions, arguing that “it can do more ‘for’ the employee than a union,” Local 77 denounced this idea as “deepening the basic problem,” suggesting that “Employees {{need to have a}} voice in their own future; and <b>that</b> <b>voice</b> can only come through collective bargaining...Only then may employees negotiate and sign a contract as mutual, equal participants rather than dependents of a paternal employer with unilateral decision-making power. Only then will the psychology of dependence be overcome.” The black work force had little power in the grievance procedures.|$|E
25|$|Safety {{levels of}} the technology, the thought of abandoning control to a machine, and {{psychological}} comfort of passengers in such situations were the major discussion topics initially. The commuters also stated {{that they did not}} want to see everything the car was doing. This was primarily a referral to the auto-steering wheel with no one sitting in the driving seat. Intel also learnt <b>that</b> <b>voice</b> control regulator is vital, and the interface between the humans and machine eases the discomfort condition, and brings some sense of control back. It is important to mention that Intel included only 10 people in this study, which makes the study less credible. In a video posted on YouTube, Intel accepted this fact and called for further testing.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Sweeney {{initiated}} several programs intended {{to reverse the}} decline in union membership and recruit more new members, especially younger people. The AFL-CIO's organizing and field mobilization programs were separated. The Field Mobilization department was given control over the AFL-CIO's regional offices, which were reduced from 12 to four. Sweeney {{set a goal of}} spending one-third of the federation's budget on organizing by 1998. An ad hoc executive council committee was established {{to come up with an}} organizing strategy for the South and Southwest, while the Union Summer program was established to recruit and deploy college-age activists. A new department, the Working Women's Department, was created and charged with developing ways to give working women a voice and to inject <b>that</b> <b>voice</b> into the labor movement's deliberations.|$|E
30|$|Voicing {{contrasts}} {{might also}} be disadvantageous for sibilants from the acoustic and auditory perspectives. Balise and Diehl (1994) measured the RMS amplitude of frication noise in English sibilants and nonsibilants and found <b>that</b> <b>voicing</b> effectively reduces the frication noise of sibilants so that they become less distinguishable from their nonsibilant counterparts. Perceptual experiments also verified this by showing <b>that</b> <b>voiced</b> fricatives {{are more difficult to}} identify than voiceless ones, and the impact is more severe on the perception of sibilants than nonsibilants (Balise and Diehl 1994; Miller and Nicely 1955; Singh and Black 1966; Wang and Bilger 1973).|$|R

60|$|Ruth, as {{has been}} stated, sat during her hours of work behind a {{ground-glass}} screen, unseen and unseeing. To her the patrons of the establishment were mere disembodied voices--wheedling voices, pathetic <b>voices,</b> <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> protested, <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> hectored, <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> whined, moaned, broke, appealed to the saints, and in various other ways endeavoured to instil into M. Gandinot more spacious and princely views on the subject advancing money on property pledged. She was sitting behind her screen this morning, scribbling idly on the blotting-pad, for {{there had been a}} lull in the business, when the door opened, and the polite, 'Bonjour, monsieur,' of M. Gandinot announced the arrival of another unfortunate.|$|R
25|$|Within hours, Canada's Indian {{community}} was {{a focus of}} attention as victims and among hints that officials were investigating connections to the Sikh separatists who had threatened and committed acts of violence in retaliation against Hindus. In the subsequent worldwide investigations over six years, many threads of the plot were uncovered. Based on recovery of wreckage and bodies from the surface, {{it was decided to}} retrieve wreckage and recorders {{from the bottom of the}} sea. <b>That</b> <b>voice</b> and flight recorders were cut out at the same time, and damage to parts recovered from the forward cargo bay consistent with a blast, established that it was probably a bomb near the forward cargo hold that brought the plane down suddenly. The flight was also soon linked to the earlier bombing in Japan which had also originated from Vancouver; tickets for both flights had been purchased by the same person, and in both cases the planes were carrying bags without the passenger who checked them in.|$|E
25|$|We {{are entirely}} in accord in admitting the {{existence}} of God. How can I doubt His when I am convinced of mine. Who so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, {{it would be to}} doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now then, my faith in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: Plus Supra!...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in <b>that</b> <b>voice,</b> mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} Gipsy Danger's {{artificial}} intelligence system. Del Toro secured permission from Valve Corporation to cast McLain in homage to GLaDOS, her homicidal AI {{character in the}} Portal video games. The director stated: [...] "It {{was clear to me}} that we needed something beautiful in <b>that</b> <b>voice.</b> My daughter is my wingman, we had done co-op on Portal 2 {{for a long time and}} I did Portal 1 when it came out. It becomes ingrained in you, <b>that</b> <b>voice.</b> I didn't want to use her as a negative force of evil. I called Valve and asked 'Can you give us the filter?' so we went full GLaDOS for the first commercial, but I thought it was too much. If you're a gamer, it's too distracting so we created our own GLaDOS 2.0 filter that's a little less full-on." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{using this}} knowledge, Smart {{was able to}} give a [...] "voice" [...] to nature; he {{believed}} that nature, like his cat Jeoffry, is always praising God but needs a poet in order to bring out <b>that</b> <b>voice.</b> As such, the themes of animals and language are merged in Jubilate Agno, and Jeoffry is transformed into a manifestation of the Ars Poetica tradition.|$|E
