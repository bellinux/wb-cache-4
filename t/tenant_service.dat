50|$|The name ConTel Corporation {{was adopted}} in 1986. That same year, ConTel's new tenant {{services}} division {{set the stage}} for future growth by acquiring <b>tenant</b> <b>service</b> operations in Atlanta and Seattle. In September 1986 ConTel announced it had agreed to merge with Communications Satellite Corporation (Comsat), but by mid-1987 ConTel had called off the deal, citing Comsat's unstable financial picture. ConTel acquired Comsat's international private-line business and its very-small-aperture terminal (VSAT) satellite business in 1987, as well as Equatorial Communications Company, a provider of private satellite data networks. That same year, ConTel agreed to sell Executone, its troubled telephone interconnect business, and Texocom, ConTtel's equipment supply business.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to construct an integrated policy development model of quality and environment management system. The whole process runs through several stages: analyzing status of sustainable <b>tenant</b> <b>service,</b> identifying leverage factors, analyzing key factors, and constructing an integrated policy development model of quality and environment management system. Results of this research show that <b>tenant</b> <b>service</b> reviewed from ecological, sociable, technological, institutional dimensions has less-sustainable status. However, when seen from its economical dimension, this <b>tenant</b> <b>service</b> matter is quite sustainable. Multi-dimensional scaling analysis provides results on twenty-three leverage factors which are sensitive to sustainability status. From these leverage factors, prospective analysis is conducted to determine key factors. It is discovered that there are four key factors: area regulations, product development innovations, raw water quantity, and shop houses development. These key factors are essential input for policy development. Researcher applies process hierarchy analysis to construct policy development model. From this model, it is discovered that the most influential actor in the development of quality management and environment system integration policy is area management. Actors pay high attention to economical dimension, but only pay low attention to ecological dimension. Development of quality management and environment system integration policy is directed at the fulfillment of area regulations, as these regulations have the heaviest weight and the highest priority...|$|E

40|$|Datacenter-based Cloud Computing {{services}} {{provide a}} flexible, scalable and yet economical infrastructure to host online {{services such as}} multimedia streaming, email and bulk storage. Many such services perform geo-replication to provide necessary quality of service and reliability to users resulting in frequent large inter- datacenter transfers. In order to meet <b>tenant</b> <b>service</b> level agreements (SLAs), these transfers have to be completed prior to a deadline. In addition, WAN resources are quite scarce and costly, meaning they should be fully utilized. Several recently proposed schemes, such as B 4, TEMPUS, and SWAN have focused on improving the utilization of inter-datacenter transfers through centralized scheduling, however, they fail to provide a mechanism to guarantee that admitted requests meet their deadlines. Also, in a recent study, authors propose Amoeba, a system that allows tenants to define deadlines and guarantees that the specified deadlines are met, however, to admit new traffic, the proposed system has to modify the allocation of already admitted transfers. In this paper, we propose Rapid Close to Deadline Scheduling (RCD), a close to deadline traffic allocation technique that is fast and efficient. Through simulations, we show that RCD is up to 15 times faster than Amoeba, provides high link utilization along with deadline guarantees, {{and is able to}} make quick decisions on whether a new request can be fully satisfied before its deadline.

40|$|Staff {{employed}} in the Victorian Office of Housing are invariably required to exercise discretion in their day-to-day work managing housing assets and providing services to public housing tenants. Policies specify processes but they never cover all situations and do not provide guidance on competing objectives. For example, preparing a property for reletting is a process with protocols and budget constraints. However, staff can make procedural variations that compy with policy. These variations, generally learnt from peers on the job, often result in budget over runs, but do result in improved properties for new tenants. Discretion is being exercised in balancing housing asset, budget control and <b>tenant</b> <b>service</b> objectives. A housing officer sums up the enduring tension in balancing objectives in the question and statement:’ Am I {{an agent of the}} state or a customer service officer? Because I can’t be both’. Organisationally these tensions are spoken about as ‘management issues’, ‘policy reengineering’ and ‘unrealistic understandings’. Using data from an ethnographic study in the Victorian Office of Housing, the paper addresses the question: ‘What do we know about the way in which front line housing officers manage competing objectives in their daily work and how might this knowledge be usefully used in the development of operational policy?’ The paper will explore the way in which complex administrative rules are used as a device to align staff to the Office of Housing objectives and limit the exercise of discretion by frontline staff. Against the background of this analysis the paper will consider the limitations of rule making {{and the extent to which}} other organisational strategies might be important for improvements in service provision in a context of constrained resources and limited resources. <br /...|$|E

Two years later ConTel purchased Telos Corporation, with expertise in government-preferred computer software.

40|$|Although cloud {{computing}} service providers offer opportunities {{for improving the}} administration, reliability, and maintenance of hosted services, they also concentrate network resources and data in {{a small number of}} cloud service providers. The concentration of data and resources introduces various associated risks, including sharing the underlying infrastructure with unknown (and untrusted) tenants and relying on the availability and security of the underlying infrastructure itself. These security risks represent some of the most significant barriers to the adoption of cloud-based services. To begin tackling these risks, a cloud hosting infrastructure should provide strong guarantees for resource and data isolation.
