She is a longtime supporter of Save the Children, an organization that helps provide children {{around the world with}} education, health care and emergency aid. She also serves {{on the board of the}} Children's Defense Fund, a child advocacy and research group. In 2006, she was among a group of actresses who went to New Orleans, Louisiana in a CDF project to publicize the needs of Hurricane Katrina victims. During this trip, she helped open the city's first Freedom School, as she met and <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> children. Witherspoon later called this an experience that she would never forget.|$|E
5|$|Fonseca chose both. First, the Brazilian Congress began {{negotiating}} with the mutineers, although this was not Fonseca's preferred solution—he and the Minister of the Navy Marques Leão began plotting a military solution. At the behest of Congress, José Carlos de Carvalho was appointed as a liaison to the rebels. Carvalho, a federal deputy and former naval captain, <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> crew on all four ships and reported to Congress that the rebels were well led and organized—and their main armament was fully functional. His report showed that the sailor's complaints, especially about the lash, were well-justified and that a military option {{would be unlikely to}} succeed. By the afternoon on 23 November, the Brazilian Congress had begun work on a bill that would grant amnesty to all involved and end the use of corporal punishment in the navy.|$|E
5|$|The Indians hired Bill McKechnie as a {{pitching}} coach after the 1946 season. One {{of his first}} jobs was to work with Gromek during the offseason and improve his pitching due to his struggles the prior year, in particular against left-handed batters. The Indians <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Yankees during the offseason about making a trade for second baseman Joe Gordon. The teams settled on Gromek as the main piece originally, but Joe DiMaggio suggested the team trade for Reynolds instead. Gromek remained on the Indians for the 1947 season as a result, but {{was moved to the}} bullpen instead of remaining in the starting rotation. The highlight of his season came on July 1 in relief of Feller, who left the game due to injury. In the game against the Browns, he threw 7.2 innings and allowed two runs in a 9–3 victory in what was his longest appearance of the season at that time. For the year, Gromek pitched in 29 games, starting 7, and had a 2–5 record and a 3.74 ERA in 84.1 innings pitched, his first full season in which he pitched under 150 innings.|$|E

He stayed in the house with some of the negroes saying he wanted to pick cotton. The white man did not have a doctor for this negro as he had not worked for him. He was buried in a homemade coffin furnished by the county. The plantation owner said it was his opinion that the man died of syphilis.|$|E

25|$|Advertising for {{the show}} was not {{distributed}} until the {{three days before the}} show, contributing to its low attendance, and Cantrell had to personally call wrestlers who had been prematurely told the event was going to be cancelled. On the night of the show, at the Hot Wheels Skate Center, the building's manager informed the arriving wrestlers that she would not allow the show to take place because the promotion already owed her $500 for a bounced check received for a previous show in January, another $100 she loaned Cantrell to pay talent, in addition to $500 for that night's show. Cantrell was not at the building that night, instead at his home recovering from his hospital stay, and so Gower <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> manager instead. She agreed to allow the show to continue provided Hot Wheels would receive the gate receipts, presumably the first $1100, to recoup the money Cantrell owed her. As GWP typically paid its talent with the gate receipts it was expected that the wrestlers would be paid with what was left. Less than 20 people were in attendance at bell time (7:30 pm), far less than expected, and none of the wrestlers were to receive payment for their appearance. Masked Superstar, Tommy Rich, Cru Jones, Terry Lawler and Gower all left before their matches and Murder One was forced to rebook the show at the last minute with the remaining wrestlers.|$|E
500|$|The auto trail {{associations}} {{rejected the}} elimination of the highway names. [...] Six regional meetings were held to hammer out the details—May 15 for the West, May 27 for the Mississippi Valley, June 3 for the Great Lakes, June 8 for the South, June 15 for the North Atlantic, and June 15 for New England. [...] Representatives of the auto trail associations were not able to formally address the meetings. [...] However, as a compromise, they <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Joint Board members. The associations finally settled on a general agreement with the numbering plans, as named trails would still be included. [...] The tentative system added up to 81,000 miles (130,000km), 2.8% of the public road mileage at the time.|$|E

In addition to their own headline dates, they also filled Ozzfest [...] "off dates" [...] with shows supporting Disturbed, Avenged Sevenfold and Hatebreed. The band members were on a day off from the festival passing through Medford, Oregon, when they pulled into a Taco Bell parking lot to eat. This resulted in a fan recognizing them and then calling over a bunch of his friends. The band <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fans, signed autographs, posed for pictures and also asked the kids if there were any shows happening that night they could participate in. They ended up doing a small club concert with local bands, with roughly 150 people in attendance. The show was a benefit with all proceeds going toward cancer research.|$|E

500|$|Yashiro's voice actor Yoshimasa Hosoya found {{singing for}} the role {{difficult}} as he lacked a natural sense of rhythm. Tiki's voice actress Sumire Morohoshi found the role difficult due to Tiki's role as an explanatory figure, together with the dramatic elements of her amnesia and wish to experience the real world. Tiki's first song [...] "Beastie Game" [...] drew from multiple musical genres to reflect her status as a vocaloid. When recording [...] "Beastie Game", Morohoshi was surprised upon hearing her voice processed {{to sound like a}} vocaloid. For her second song, [...] "Not A Phantom World", Morohoshi had to record multiple chorus elements which were then layered as backing for the main song, encountering difficulties making all her harmonies work together properly. Yuichi Nakamura portrayed Barry as the group's mood maker, while Maiko's actress Ami Koshimizu worked to make her character both aloof and charming. During voice and song recording, Aburai actively <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cast about their vocal nuances and interpretations of each song.|$|E

500|$|On Good Friday in March 2005, Veitch, Albee and {{six other}} women went to a strip club in Riverside and paid for lap dances. Instead of {{accepting}} the dances, they <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> strippers, telling {{them that they were}} loved and accepted by God, that churches were composed entirely of sinners, and that they would be welcome there. One of the lap dancers cried and told Albee she had often wanted to go to a church but had never done so because she had thought that she would be rejected. The woman accepted a prayer from Albee and hugged her. Albee would later say that talking with women at the strip club that first day changed her life. Because the volunteers received more positive responses than they had expected, they decided to continue to evangelize at strip clubs. To organize these activities, Veitch and Albee founded JC's Girls, with [...] "JC" [...] standing for Jesus Christ. They made Matthew's House the parent organization, but decided to operate primarily under the name [...] "JC's Girls" [...] because Veitch believed that strippers would not understand the meaning of the name [...] "Matthew's House".|$|E
500|$|Lang's {{relationship}} with his curates was generally formal. They were aware of his ambition and felt that he sometimes {{spent too much time}} on his outside interests such as his All Souls Fellowship, but were nevertheless impressed by his efficiency and his powers of oratory. The Church historian Adrian Hastings singles out Portsea under Lang as an example of [...] "extremely disciplined pastoral professionalism". Lang may have realised that he was destined for high office; he is reported to have practised the signature [...] "Cosmo Cantuar" [...] during a relaxed discussion with his curates ("Cantuar" [...] is part of the Archbishop of Canterbury's formal signature). In January 1898 he was invited by Queen Victoria to preach at Osborne House, her Isle of Wight home. Afterwards he <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Queen who, Lang records, suggested that he should marry. Lang replied that he could not afford to as his curates cost too much. He added: [...] "If a curate proves unsatisfactory I can get rid of him. A wife is a fixture." [...] He was summoned on several more occasions and in the following January was appointed an Honorary Chaplain to the Queen. These visits to Osborne were the start of a close association with the Royal Family which lasted for the rest of Lang's life. As one of the Queen's chaplains, he assisted in the funeral arrangements after her death in January 1901.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} mainly {{divided into four}} acts with {{different}} themes: The Circus, House of Fun (Anything Goes), FreakshowPeepshow, Electro Circ and ended with the encore. It began with [...] "Welcome to the Circus", a video introduction featuring Perez Hilton as Queen Elizabeth I. In {{the middle of the}} video, the cylinder screen started to rise, while Spears appeared on the video and shot Hilton with a crossbow, causing him to fall backwards onto the floor. As the video ended, Spears descended from the ceiling on a suspended platform, wearing the headdress, a ringmaster jacket, black shorts, high-heeled boots and carrying a whip. She started with a performance of [...] "Circus", which featured acrobats taking the stage and spun on giant rings in the air. The song ended with Spears taking off her ringleader jacket to reveal the Swaroski-crystal corset and running {{into the center of the}} main stage, as she was surrounded by jets of smoke. She entered a golden cage, where she performed [...] "Piece of Me", dancing and attempting to escape from her dancers. A brief interlude followed, featuring a performance by acrobats twirling from suspended fabric, simulating a thunderstorm. before Spears went into [...] "Radar" [...] which featured her pole dancing on each of the stage's rings. [...] The first intermezzo showcased her dancers doing a martial arts inspired dance to the LAZRtag remix of [...] "Gimme More". In the next section, Ed Alonzo took the stage and Spears [...] played her assistant in [...] "Ooh Ooh Baby" [...] entering a box and being sawed in half. After she came out, she entered another box in the middle of the stage and the performance ended with Alonzo dropping the curtains and showing that Spears had escaped from it, while the top of the box exploded in a shower of sparks. At the same time, Spears reappeared with four female dancers in one of the satellite stages, dancing to [...] "Hot as Ice". The next song was the Co-Ed Remix of [...] "Boys", which Spears performed wearing a military costume, while surrounded by her dancers, some of them riding bicycles. At the end of the song she performed a military drill with her male dancers before moving into [...] "If U Seek Amy", which featured her pushing them with a giant pink mallet, in a similar way to Whac-A-Mole. After a brief interlude, she [...] returned to continue the act with a Bollywood-inspired remix of [...] "Me Against the Music". She briefly <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> audience before she sat on a giant umbrella and was lifted into the air to perform [...] "Everytime".|$|E
