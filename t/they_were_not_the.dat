5|$|On October10, another {{tropical}} depression formed {{further to the}} north of the previous storm. It possibly developed from the same tropical wave that spawned the previous depression, although <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> same system. The depression maintained a general northward movement throughout its duration, dissipating on October12.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{held that}} the plaintiffs lacked locus standi to bring the action as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> temple's legal owners. In any case, as there was {{evidence}} that the authorities had rational reasons for treating the temple property differently from {{the property of the}} Mission and the Church, the High Court found that there had been no breach of Article 12(1). Furthermore, the Court determined that the plaintiffs were guilty of inordinate delay in bringing the action.|$|E
5|$|At daybreak on {{the third}} day, the Phocians {{guarding}} the path above Thermopylae {{became aware of the}} outflanking Persian column by the rustling of oak leaves. Herodotus says they jumped up and were greatly amazed. Hydarnes was perhaps just as amazed to see them hastily arming themselves as they were to see him and his forces. He feared they were Spartans but was informed by Ephialtes that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not.</b> <b>The</b> Phocians retreated to a nearby hill to make their stand (assuming the Persians had come to attack them). However, not wishing to be delayed, the Persians merely shot a volley of arrows at them, before bypassing them to continue with their encirclement of the main Greek force.|$|E

5|$|Doro {{started her}} career in garage bands in native Düsseldorf {{underground}} scene and achieved media visibility and some commercial success with Warlock in the 1980s. Warlock were starting to have {{an opening in the}} US market, when they went through many line-up changes and Pesch was left the only original member of the band. She started a solo career under the name Doro, in order to avoid legal battles between her record label PolyGram and her former manager. She released two albums in the US with producers Joey Balin and Gene Simmons, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> breakthrough that she hoped.|$|E
5|$|<b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first Australians {{to serve}} on the Western Front. An Australian Voluntary Hospital had been formed in England in August 1914 from Australian expatriates. All medical {{practitioners}} in the unit were Australians and although women were not allowed to serve as doctors, Australian nurses were accepted. The unit left for France in August 1914 and from October was based at Wimereux, where the 2nd General Hospital joined it in June 1916. In July 1916, the Australian Voluntary Hospital was absorbed into the British Army. Another group of Australians had also arrived in France before I Anzac Corps. In June 1915, the 1st Siege Artillery Brigade was formed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Walter Adams Coxen, the Australian Army's Director of Artillery, for service on the Western Front. About half the men in the unit were permanent gunners of the Garrison Artillery. The brigade departed Melbourne for England on 17 July 1915 and landed in France on 27 February 1916. Its 54th Siege Battery was equipped with 8 inch howitzers and its 55th Siege Battery with 9.2 inch howitzers.|$|E
5|$|When dinosaurs appeared, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> {{dominant}} terrestrial animals. The {{terrestrial habitats}} were occupied by {{various types of}} archosauromorphs and therapsids, like cynodonts and rhynchosaurs. Their main competitors were the pseudosuchia, such as aetosaurs, ornithosuchids and rauisuchians, which were more successful than the dinosaurs. Most of these other animals became extinct in the Triassic, {{in one of two}} events. First, at about 215million years ago, a variety of basal archosauromorphs, including the protorosaurs, became extinct. This was followed by the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event (about 200million years ago), that saw the end of most of the other groups of early archosaurs, like aetosaurs, ornithosuchids, phytosaurs, and rauisuchians. Rhynchosaurs and dicynodonts survived (at least in some areas) at least as late as early-mid Norian and early Rhaetian, respectively, and the exact date of their extinction is uncertain. These losses left behind a land fauna of crocodylomorphs, dinosaurs, mammals, pterosaurians, and turtles. The first few lines of early dinosaurs diversified through the Carnian and Norian stages of the Triassic, possibly by occupying the niches of the groups that became extinct.|$|E

5|$|If {{the player}} saved Curly Brace earlier, the player may find an item to restore her memories. She remembers that the player character's name is Quote, and that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> killer robots who {{slaughtered}} Mimigas in the past. Instead, {{they were sent}} to destroy the Demon Crown to prevent its power from falling into the wrong hands. Quote finds Sue's mother, Momorin, who is building a rocket that will allow access {{to the top of}} the island where the Doctor resides. After helping her complete the rocket, Quote confronts Misery and the Doctor. The Doctor has purified the essence of the red flowers into a crystal, which allows him to survive even after Quote destroys his body. The Doctor's spirit possesses the Core of the island, but Quote succeeds in destroying that as well, causing the island to begin falling to Earth. Should the player have saved Curly and restored her memories, they may proceed into a bonus stage called the Bloodstained Sanctuary where Curly can be found and rescued; it is also here that Ballos - creator of the Demon Crown and Jenka's younger brother - is imprisoned. A powerful wizard who went insane and destroyed his homeland after being tortured by a jealous king, Ballos was sealed deep within the island by his sister. At some point, his niece Misery forced him to create the demon crown, but she and Balrog became cursed to serve whoever possessed it. Additionally, it is stated via narration that the Demon Crown will repair itself if it is destroyed, and will only truly lose its power if Ballos is killed, necessitating that Quote and Curly take his life.|$|E
25|$|Nebraska {{also has}} had five undefeated seasons in which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> {{national}} champions: 1902, 1903, 1913, 1914, and 1915. Between 1912 and 1916, a 34-game unbeaten streak was recorded by head coach Ewald O. Stiehm.|$|E

25|$|The Ferraris of Alain Prost and Jean Alesi were {{expected}} to be the strongest team, but their V-12s and 7-speed semi-automatic gearboxes were not well suited to the tight turns and short straights of the street circuit.

25|$|Coupled {{with all}} this, {{materials}} such as celluloid have been recognised as highly flammable since early days of its usage, and acts such as the Celluloid and Cinematograph Films Act 1922 and the Cinematograph Act 1952 gave the fire brigade powers to take samples of film and test them for flammability even though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> enforcing authority.|$|E

25|$|The {{argument}} that Arab immigration somehow {{made up a}} large part of the Palestinian Arab population is thus statistically untenable.

25|$|In Ancient Hawaii, a luakini temple, or luakini heiau, was a Native Hawaiian sacred {{place where}} {{human and animal}} blood sacrifices were offered.

25|$|A {{second group}} at British Oxygen also unknowingly {{discovered}} ferrocene.

They published this result in 1952 although the actual work was done three years earlier. The stability of the new organoiron compound was accorded to the aromatic character of the negatively charged cyclopentadienyls, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> ones to recognize the η5 (pentahapto) sandwich structure.|$|E
