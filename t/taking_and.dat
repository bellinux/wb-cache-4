5|$|Montejo was {{appointed}} alcalde mayor (a local colonial governor) of Tabasco in 1529, and pacified that province {{with the aid}} of his son, also named Francisco de Montejo. D'Avila was sent from eastern Yucatán to conquer Acalan, which extended southeast of the Laguna de Terminos. Montejo the Younger founded Salamanca de Xicalango as a base of operations. In 1530 D'Avila established Salamanca de Acalán as a base from which to launch new attempts to conquer Yucatán. Salamanca de Acalán proved a disappointment, with no gold for the <b>taking</b> <b>and</b> with lower levels of population than had been hoped. D'Avila soon abandoned the new settlement and set off across the lands of the Kejache to Champotón, arriving there towards the end of 1530. During a colonial power struggle in Tabasco, the elder Montejo was imprisoned for a time. Upon his release, he met up with his son in Xicalango, Tabasco, and they then both rejoined d'Avila at Champotón.|$|E

5|$|The Platte Canyon High School {{hostage crisis}} was a hostage <b>taking</b> <b>and</b> {{shooting}} at Platte Canyon High School in Bailey, Colorado, on September 27, 2006. The gunman, 53-year-old Duane Roger Morrison, took six female students hostage and sexually assaulted them, later releasing four. When police broke open the classroom's door with explosives, Morrison opened {{fire with a}} semi-automatic pistol before shooting hostage Emily Keyes in the head. The other remaining hostages escaped unharmed, and paramedics confirmed that Morrison had committed suicide shortly before police were able to enter the classroom. Keyes was pronounced dead at 4:32 p.m. MDT (23:32 UTC) at Saint Anthony's Hospital in Denver, Colorado after undergoing emergency surgery.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{breakage}} {{is related}} to a carnivore's behavior. The mandibles of canids are buttressed behind the carnassial teeth {{to enable them to}} crack bones with their post-carnassial teeth (molars M2 and M3). A study found that the modern gray wolf possesses greater buttressing when compared to all other extant canids and the extinct dire wolf. This indicates that the gray wolf is better adapted for cracking bone than other canids. In comparison to extant North American gray wolves, Beringian wolves included many more individuals with moderately to heavily worn teeth and with a significantly greater number of broken teeth. The frequencies of fracture in wolves ranged from a minimum of 2% found in the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf (Canis lupus irremotus) up to a maximum of 11% found in Beringian wolves. The distribution of fractures across the tooth row also differs, with Beringian wolves having much higher frequencies of fracture for incisors, carnassials, and molars. A similar pattern was observed in spotted hyenas, suggesting that increased incisor and carnassial fracture reflects habitual bone consumption because bones are gnawed with the incisors and then cracked with the carnassials and molars. The risk of tooth fracture is also higher when <b>taking</b> <b>and</b> consuming large prey.|$|E

40|$|The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 2005 {{decision}} in Kelo v. City of New London brought {{the issues of}} <b>takings</b> <b>and</b> public use into the national spotlight. A groundswell of opposition to government-initiated 2 ̆ 7 economic development takings 2 ̆ 7 the Court deemed a public use under the Fifth Amendment led to eminent domain reform legislation in over 30 states.
