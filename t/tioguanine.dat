50|$|Thiouric acid, more {{accurately}} called 6-thiouric acid, is a main inactive metabolite of the immunosuppressive drugs azathioprine, mercaptopurine and <b>tioguanine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Tioguanine,</b> {{also known}} as {{thioguanine}} or 6-thioguanine (6-TG) is a medication used to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Long term use is not recommended. It is given by mouth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tioguanine</b> {{was between}} 1949 and 1951. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale price in the developing world is about 7.07 USD per 40 mg pill as of 2014. In the United Kingdom this amount costs the NHS about 4.14 pounds.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include bone marrow suppression, liver {{problems}} and {{inflammation of the}} mouth. It is recommended that liver enzymes be checked weekly when on the medication. People with a genetic deficiency in thiopurine S-methyltransferase are at higher risk of side effects. Avoiding pregnancy when on the medication is recommended {{for both males and}} females. <b>Tioguanine</b> is in the antimetabolite family of medications. It is a purine analogue of guanine and works by disrupting DNA and RNA.|$|E
50|$|Unable {{to obtain}} a {{graduate}} research position, {{she worked as a}} food quality supervisor at A&P supermarkets, and for a food lab in New York, testing the acidity of pickles and the color of egg yolk going into mayonnaise. Later, she left to work as an assistant to George H. Hitchings at the Burroughs-Wellcome pharmaceutical company in Tuckahoe, New York (now GlaxoSmithKline). Hitchings was using a new way of developing drugs, by imitating natural compounds instead of through trial and error. He believed that if he could trick cancer cells into accepting artificial compounds for growth, they could be destroyed without also destroying normal cells. She began to work with purines, and in 1950, she developed the anti-cancer drugs <b>tioguanine</b> and 6-MP.|$|E
40|$|Although a {{great variety}} of new drugs have been {{introduced}} for the therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases so far, a definite cure of the disease is still out of scope. An anti-inflammatory approach to induce remission followed by maintenance therapy with immunosupressants is still the mainstay of therapy. Thiopurines comprising azathioprine and its active metabolite mercaptopurine as well as <b>tioguanine,</b> are widely used in the therapy of chronic active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Their steroid sparing potential and efficacy in remission maintenance are out of doubt. Unfortunately, untoward adverse events are frequently observed and may preclude further administration or be life threatening. This review will focus on new aspects of thiopurine therapy in IBD, its efficacy and safety...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Conventional thiopurine [azathioprine and mercaptopurine] {{treatment}} {{during pregnancy}} {{in patients with}} inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] {{is considered to be}} safe; however data on the safety and teratogenicity of the non-conventional thiopurine <b>tioguanine</b> [TG] in pregnant IBD patients are lacking. We aim to describe the safety and teratogenicity of TG treatment during pregnancy in IBD patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective, multicentre descriptive case series of female IBD patients using TG during pregnancy. Data on disease and medication history, pregnancy complications, pregnancy outcome, mode of delivery, preterm birth, birthweight, congenital abnormalities, laboratory signs of myelosuppression or hepatotoxicity, and 6 -thioguaninenucleotide [6 -TGN] concentrations in mother and neonate were collected. RESULTS: In all, 13 patients [77 % Crohn's disease, 23 % ulcerative colitis] used TG [median dose 18 g/day] during pregnancy; 19 pregnancies, including 1 twin pregnancy, were included. Spontaneous abortion occurred in three pregnancies. In 7 of the 16 ongoing pregnancies a caesarean section was performed. One neonate had a mild congenital abnormality [distal shaft hypospadias]. In the singleton pregnancies, the median birthweight was 3410 g at a median of gestational age of 39 weeks. No preterm birth [< 37 weeks] or low birthweight [< 2500 g] was observed in the singleton newborns. In the twin pregnancy an induction of labour was performed at 35 + 1 weeks of gestation because of pre-eclampsia. Both neonates had a low birthweight. CONCLUSIONS: This relatively small case series supports safe use of TG in pregnant IBD patients. Still, consideration should be given to the indication and continuation of TG during pregnancy...|$|E
