However, {{the effect of the}} rebellions and desertions within the 4th Army was significant within the flanking 2nd and 7th Armies, and contributed to further withdrawals. This was particularly marked {{in the area of the}} 7th Army, which was forced to withdraw from the Drava on the night of 8/9 April due to <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 4th Army on its right flank, leading to the loss of Maribor.|$|E

Despite the losses, some ships did reach their destination intact and further supply ships were prepared, including the frigate Topaze, ordered to transport 1,100 barrels of flour to Cayenne. The cargo was loaded during late November and early December, the frigate also carrying military supplies and 100 soldiers to augment the Cayenne garrison.

5|$|In Scandinavian folklore, {{a diverse}} array of human-like supernatural beings are attested which might {{be thought of as}} elves and which might partly {{originate}} in medieval Scandinavian beliefs. However, the characteristics and names of these beings has varied widely across time and space, and they cannot be neatly categorised. These beings are sometimes known by words descended directly from Old Norse álfr. However, in the modern languages, these traditional terms have tended to be replaced with other terms. Things are further {{complicated by the fact that}} when referring to the elves of Old Norse mythology, scholars have adopted new forms based directly on the Old Norse word álfr.

The Electoral Commission of Kenya officially declared that the incumbent President Mwai Kibaki was re-elected; supporters of the opposition candidate Raila Odinga accused the government of electoral fraud and rejected the results. A series of protests and demonstrations followed, and fighting—mainly along tribal lines—led to many deaths, injuries and displacements.|$|E

The remainder of 1991 saw further deterioration of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region, resulting in war crimes against Serbs and Croats in the Gospić and Široka Kula massacres.

5|$|A {{short period}} of home leave followed, before the battalion's {{personnel}} concentrated at Royal Park for a march through Melbourne. A draft of reinforcements arrived around this time also, incorporating men from New South Wales and several others states. In mid-September, the battalion moved to Greta, New South Wales, travelling by rail through Shepparton, Tocumwal and Newcastle. A brief period of training was undertaken there, during which the battalion's khaki uniforms were dyed green. During this time, the battalion was re-organised and converted to the jungle establishment; {{as part of this}} process its authorised strength was reduced to around 800 personnel of all ranks. <b>The</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific had deteriorated dramatically, and the Australian forces holding out against the Japanese in New Guinea were hard-pressed and desperately in need of reinforcement. Thus in early October 1942, not more than two months after returning to Australia, the 2/5th moved to Brisbane, Queensland, where it deployed to Milne Bay, which had only recently been held {{in the face of a}} Japanese landing, aboard the Dutch transport Maetsuyker.|$|E
5|$|Amalric {{had come}} to power in 1164 and had made it his goal to conquer Egypt. Egypt had been invaded by King Baldwin I fifty years earlier, and the weak Fatimid Caliphate was forced to pay yearly tribute to Jerusalem. Amalric turned towards Egypt because Muslim {{territory}} {{to the east of}} Jerusalem had fallen {{under the control of the}} powerful Zengid sultan Nur ad-Din. Nur ad-Din had taken control of Damascus in 1154, six years after the disastrous siege of Damascus by the Second Crusade in 1148. Jerusalem could now expand only to the southwest, towards Egypt, and in 1153 Ascalon, the last Fatimid outpost in Palestine, fell to the crusaders. Nur ad-Din, however, also wished to acquire Egypt, and sent his army to hinder Amalric's plans. This was <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east when William returned from Europe. In 1167 Amalric married Maria Comnena, grand-niece of Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus, and in 1168 the king sent William to finalize a treaty for a joint Byzantine-crusader campaign against Egypt. The expedition, Amalric's fourth, was the first with support from the Byzantine navy. Amalric, however, did not wait for the fleet to arrive. He managed to capture Damietta, but within a few years he was expelled from Egypt by one of Nur ad-Din's generals, Saladin, who would later become Jerusalem's greatest threat.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1749, Benning Wentworth, New Hampshire's governor, was selling land grants {{in the area}} west of the Connecticut River, to which New Hampshire had always laid {{somewhat}} dubious claim. Many of these grants were sold at relatively low prices to land speculators, with some land kicked back to Wentworth. In 1764, King George issued an order resolving the competing claims of New York and New Hampshire in favor of New York. New York, which had also issued land grants that overlapped some of those sold by Wentworth, insisted that holders of the Wentworth grants pay a fee to New York to have their grants validated. As this fee approached the original purchase price, {{and many of the}} holders were land-rich and cash-poor, {{there was a great deal}} of resistance to this demand. By 1769 <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grants had deteriorated to the point where surveyors and other figures of New York authority were being physically threatened and driven from the area.|$|E
