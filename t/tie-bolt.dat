40|$|Tie-rod and <b>Tie-bolt</b> rotors have {{different}} applications in industries. Vibration {{analysis of this}} type of rotors would be useful for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis purposes. Tie-rod rotors consist of several disks that are tightened by a rod crossed among them. <b>Tie-bolt</b> rotors also consist of several disks that are tightened by several bolts crossed among them. Modeling of these kinds of rotors is different from simple continuous rotors because of their multi-sectional configuration. In this paper, a novel finite element model has been developed for a typical tie-rod/tie-bolt rotor. In this model, the flanges of disks are assumed as an extra rotor which surrounds the main rod (or man bolts). In addition, the stiffness effects of webs are neglected and they are considered as inertial elements. The Timoshenko shaft element is used for modeling the tie-rod/tie-bolt rotor. Damping matrix including gyroscopic terms and internal damping of the shaft has been neglected. Consideringthe assembly mechanism of rotor (rod/bolts tensioned and disks pressed), the stiffness matrix is modified in order {{to take into account the}} axial force effect. As a result, the finite element model is applied for an industrial shaft. Using Campbell diagram, run up critical speeds and the corresponding mode shapes are extracted fordifferent values of axial force. The results exhibit that the compressive axial force in rotor has decreasing effect on critical speeds. The results are compared with the experimental data available in the literature and good agreement has been achieved...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{attention}} is being directed towards polymer electrolyte fuel cells as battery replacements {{because of their}} potentially superior energy densities {{and the possibility of}} `mechanical` refueling. On {{the low end of the}} power requirement scale (ca. 10 W), fuel cells can compete with primary and secondary batteries only if the fuel cell systems are simple, inexpensive, and reliable. Considerations of cost and simplicity (and minimal parasitic power) discourage the use of conventional performance enhancing subsystems (e. g., humidification, cooling, or forced-reactant flow). We are developing a stack design that is inherently self-regulating to allow effective operation without the benefit of such auxiliary components. The air cathode does not use forced flow to replenish the depleted oxygen. Instead, the oxygen in the air must diffuse into the stack from the periphery of the unit cells. For this reason the stack is described as `air-breathing. ` This configuration limits the ability of water to escape which prevents the polymer electrolyte membranes from drying out, even at relatively high continuous operation temperatures (+ 60 degrees C). This results in stacks with reliable and stable performance. This air-breathing configuration assumes a unique stack geometry that utilizes circular flow-field plates with an annular hydrogen feed manifold and the single <b>tie-bolt</b> extending up through the central axis of the stack. With this geometry, the hydrogen supply to the unit cells is radially outward, and the air supply is from the periphery inward. This configuration has several advantages. The entire periphery is free to air access and allows greater heat conduction to enhance cooling. Furthermore, all of the components in the stack (e. g., the flow-fields, seals and membrane/electrode assemblies), are radially symmetrical, so part fabrication is simple and the entire system is potentially low-cost. Lastly, this configuration is compact and lightweight...|$|E
50|$|The Union Village Covered Bridge {{stands in}} {{southern}} Thetford, in rural Union Village, spanning the south-flowing Ompompanoosuc River on Academy Road. It is a single-span multiple kingpost truss structure, 113 ft long with portals that flare outward. It rests on original abutments of dry-laid stone {{that have been}} faced or capped in concrete. It is 19 ft wide, with a roadway width of 15 ft (one lane). The floor supports consist of stringers that have been <b>tie-bolted</b> together, reinforced in the 20th-century {{by the addition of}} laminated beams to the underside. The exterior is finished in vertical board siding, with square window openings cut into the sides. The roof is made of standing seam metal.|$|R
