[...] At first he placed light subjects against a background, as in Still Life with Four Stone Bottles, Flask and White Cup (1884) [...] <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> the effectiveness of using [...] "pure colors, such as in Still Life with Lemons on a plate (1887) {{and even more so}} in Still Life: Drawing Board, Pipe, Onions and Sealing-Wax (1889)." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1923, Miller {{entered the}} University of Colorado in Boulder, where he joined Sigma Nu Fraternity, but {{spent most of}} his time away from school, {{attending}} auditions and playing any gigs he could get, including with Boyd Senter's band in Denver. He dropped out of school after failing three out of five classes one semester, and decided to concentrate on making a career as a professional musician. He later studied the Schillinger technique with Joseph Schillinger, under whose tutelage he composed what became his signature theme, [...] "Moonlight Serenade". In 1926, Miller toured with several groups, eventually landing a good spot in Ben Pollack's group in Los Angeles. He also played for Victor Young, allowing him to be mentored by other professional musicians. In the beginning, he was the main trombone soloist of the band. But when Jack Teagarden joined Pollack's band in 1928, Miller found that his solos were cut drastically. From <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> that, rather than being a trombonist, his future lay in arranging or writing music. He also had a songbook published in Chicago in 1928 entitled Glenn Miller's 125 Jazz Breaks for Trombone by the Melrose Brothers copyrighted in 1927. During his stint with Pollack, Miller wrote several musical arrangements of his own. He also co-wrote his first composition, [...] "Room 1411", written with Benny Goodman and released as a Brunswick 78, 4013, credited to Bennie Goodman's Boys. In 1928, when the band arrived in New York City, he sent for and married his college sweetheart, Helen Burger. He was a member of Red Nichols's orchestra in 1930, and because of Nichols, Miller played in the pit bands of two Broadway shows, Strike Up the Band and Girl Crazy (where his bandmates included future big band leaders Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa).|$|E
2500|$|An ardent Francophile in his youth, Chamberlain had {{a marked}} {{preference}} for speaking French over English. It was {{only at the}} age of twenty three in November 1878, when he first heard the music of Richard Wagner—which struck him with all the force of a religious revelation—that Chamberlain became not only a Wagnerite, but an ardent Germanophile and Francophobe. As he put later, it was <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> the full [...] "degeneracy" [...] of the French culture that he had so admired compared to the greatness of the German culture that had produced Wagner, who Chamberlain viewed {{as one of the great}} geniuses of all time. In the music of Wagner, Chamberlain finally found the mystical, life-affirming spiritual force that he had been unsuccessfully seeking to find in British and French cultures. Further increasing his love of Germany [...] was that he had fallen in love with a German woman named Anna Horst, and she with him. As Chamberlain's wealthy, snobbish family back in Britain objected to him marrying the lower middle-class Horst on the grounds that she was socially unsuitable for him, this further estranged him from Britain, a place whose people Chamberlain regarded as cold, unfeeling, callous and concerned only with money. By contrast, Chamberlain regarded Germany as the romantic [...] "land of love", a place whose people had human feelings like love, and whose culture was infused with a special spirituality that brought out the best in humanity. In 1883–1884, Chamberlain lived in Paris and worked as a stockbroker. Chamberlain's attempts to play the Paris bourse ended in failure as he proved to be inept at business, and much of his hatred of capitalism stemmed from his time in Paris. More happily for him, Chamberlain founded the first Wagner society in Paris and often contributed articles to the Revue Wagnérienne, the first journal in France devoted to Wagner studies. Together with his friend, the French writer Édouard Dujardin, Chamberlain did much to introduce Wagner to the French, who until then had largely ignored Wagner's music.|$|E
