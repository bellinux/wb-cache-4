25|$|There {{are other}} {{essential}} aspects of emergency psychiatry: observation and collateral information. The {{observation of the}} patient's behavior is {{an important aspect of}} emergency psychiatry inasmuch as it allows the clinicians working with the patient to estimate prognosis and improvements/declines in condition. Many jurisdictions base involuntary commitment on dangerousness or the inability to care for one's basic needs. Observation {{for a period of time}} may help determine this. For example, if a patient who is committed for violent behavior in the community, continues to behave in an erratic manner without clear purpose, this will help the staff decide <b>that</b> <b>hospital</b> admission may be needed.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the age of}} {{the motor}} vehicle many Hospital Boards ran their own services. From 1957 to 1990 the Hospital Act stipulated <b>that</b> <b>Hospital</b> Boards had to provide an {{ambulance}} service. Many contracted that out to St John or had ad hoc arrangements with them, often for after hours staffing. When the Hospital Act was replaced by Health Boards, many of these Boards saw this as a chance to avoid being responsible and subsequently St John took over from many Boards (e.g. Thames, Bay of Plenty, Wanganui, Palmerston North, Waipawa, Dannevirke, Nelson, West Coast, Ashburton, Southland). Marlborough stayed a Hospital-based service until 2007 and Taranaki until 2011. Wairarapa was the last region with a hospital-based service, ceasing in March 2012 and being taken over by Wellington Free Ambulance.|$|E

25|$|One man, Wang Xiaohua, {{was imprisoned}} in a labor camp in Yunnan in 2001 {{when he and}} twenty other Falun Gong detainees were taken to a hospital.

She says <b>that</b> <b>hospital</b> staff drew large volumes of blood, conducted chest x-rays and probed the prisoners’ organs.

25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps.

I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of <b>that</b> <b>hospital</b> would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

500|$|Theme Hospital {{took over}} two years to develop. The idea came from Peter Molyneux and {{journalist}} James Leach, who explored the possibility of other Theme games while discussing Theme Park. Leach suggested a hospital, and Molyneux was enthusiastic about the idea. Development began when the designer Mark Webley selected Theme Hospital {{from a list of}} possible games put together by Molyneux, and Webley, along with the artist Gary Carr, visited the Royal Surrey County Hospital and Frimley Park Hospital to get inspiration. Carr was initially displeased at the prospect of working on Theme Hospital: he had previously left Bullfrog to work for The Bitmap Brothers because he did not have faith in Theme Park. He chose to return based on his belief that he would work on Dungeon Keeper, which he was eager to do. Initially, Theme Hospital was to feature real diseases, but these were replaced with fictional, comedic afflictions as it was decided that the game's maladies should not be too realistic: the team were faced with the dilemma of having to make the hospital fun and interesting, as Webley stated that theme parks are [...] "colourful" [...] compared to hospitals, and Carr believed <b>that</b> <b>hospital</b> rooms looked very similar and that {{it was hard to tell}} what each machines does. It was during a hospital visit that they came up with the idea of using made-up illnesses and cures: Carr considered death [...] "quite sad" [...] and believed that illness was not a popular subject. He stated that using made-up illnesses gave them [...] "creative freedom", which he believed was essential. Webley said that Carr was concerned that using real diseases might be considered distasteful. According to Carr, the team were aiming for humour rather than gore. During the initial stages of programming, Bullfrog hired James Leach, who wrote the game's text and came up with the diseases. Molyneux was not directly involved in the game's production as he was then working on Dungeon Keeper.|$|E
