50|$|In the UK, road {{vehicles}} that provide postal services {{are known as}} Mobile <b>Post</b> <b>Offices,</b> to differentiate them from the (now obsolete) rail <b>Travelling</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> (TPOs). Mobile <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> were first introduced in 1936 to provide telegraph, telephone and postal services at special events such as race meetings and shows. The need for large Mobile <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> declined over the years, but since the mid-1990s small van versions have appeared in rural towns without a permanent <b>Post</b> <b>Office.</b>|$|R
25|$|The world's first {{official}} {{carriage of mail}} by rail was by the United Kingdom's General Post Office in November 1830, using adapted railway carriages on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Sorting of mail en route first occurred in the United Kingdom {{with the introduction of}} the <b>Travelling</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> in 1838 on the Grand Junction Railway following the introduction of the Railways (Conveyance of Mails) Act 1838.|$|E
25|$|G Deck, the Lower Deck, was {{the lowest}} {{complete}} deck to accommodate passengers, and had the lowest portholes, protruding above the waterline. The squash court was located here along with the <b>travelling</b> <b>post</b> <b>office</b> where mail clerks sorted letters and parcels {{so that they would}} be ready for delivery when the ship docked. Food was also stored here. The deck was interrupted at several points by orlop (partial) decks over the boiler, engine and turbine rooms.|$|E
25|$|The LMS {{had its own}} {{collection}} of small objects at Euston. It also began {{to build up a}} {{collection of}} historic locomotives, which included Caledonian 123, Columbine, Cornwall, Hardwicke, Highland 103, Midland 118 and Pet. Three others, set aside for preservation at Crewe Works, were scrapped in a change of policy in 1932. The LMS set aside one further locomotive (Midland 158A) before it was overtaken by nationalisation. It also succeeded in preserving a collection of historic royal saloons at Wolverton and built a replica Rocket, with six replica carriages, for the Liverpool & Manchester Railway centenary in 1930, and a replica Grand Junction Railway <b>Travelling</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Most {{countries}} have many sorting offices; the USPS has about 275. [...] Some small territories such as Tahiti have only one. Sorting vans were used at various times; the UK had sorting vans, or carriages, in their <b>Travelling</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> but those services were terminated in 2004. {{while in the}} USA the Railway Mail Service used a Railway <b>post</b> <b>office</b> for sorting the mail. As of 2017, Germany has about 95-98 sorting offices across the country.|$|R
50|$|By August 1900 the war {{moved from}} a fluid one to garrisoning the {{territory}} that had been gained. Consequently, the Field <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> were converted into Stationary Army <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> and were issued with {{a new series of}} date stamps, which included the name of the town where the office was based.To service these Stationary <b>Offices,</b> five <b>Travelling</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> (TPO - <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> operating from a railway carriage) were set up and were operated by the APOC. The TPO vans were improvised from large box trucks fitted out with sorting frames, tables etc. by the Royal Engineers.|$|R
50|$|The first {{offices were}} in Beijing, Kalgan, Tientsin, and Urga (in Mongolia), all in areas near to Russian-controlled territory. In November 1886 {{additional}} offices opened in Shanghai, Chefoo, Hankow {{with offices in}} Port Arthur, and Dairen following soon afterwards. In addition, many Russian Field <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> operated throughout Manchuria and civilian mail was frequently accepted there as well. Finally, the Chinese Eastern Railway had Russian <b>post</b> <b>offices</b> operating at {{most of the major}} stations, and important cities along the railway such as Harbin had several Russian <b>post</b> <b>offices</b> in the town itself. In addition, <b>Travelling</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> operated in trains along the Chinese Eastern Railway.|$|R

50|$|<b>Travelling</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> (TPO) {{operated}} {{on the line}} between October 1900 and 1930. They were housed in a separate van where mail was collected, sorted and delivered as the train was in motion. At places where the train did not usually stop, mail arms were erected, from which an occupant of the mail van could retrieve a mail bag whilst the train was travelling; deliveries were effected by dropping a bag of mail onto the platform.|$|R
25|$|During the British Mandate over Palestine about 160 <b>post</b> <b>offices,</b> rural {{agencies}}, <b>travelling</b> <b>post</b> <b>offices,</b> {{and town}} agencies operated, some {{only for a}} few months, others for {{the entire length of the}} period. Upon the advance of allied forces in 1917 and 1918, initially Field <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> and Army <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> served the local civilian population. Some of the latter offices were converted to Stationary Army <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> and became civilian <b>post</b> <b>offices</b> upon establishment of the civilian administration. In 1919 fifteen offices existed, rising to about 100 by 1939, and about 150 by the end of the Mandate in May 1948. With most of the Jerusalem General <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> archives destroyed, research depends heavily on philatelists recording distinct postmarks and dates of their use.|$|R
5000|$|A {{passenger}} train may consist {{of one or}} several locomotives and coaches. Alternatively, a train may consist entirely of passenger carrying coaches, {{some or all of}} which are powered as a [...] "multiple unit". In many parts of the world, particularly the Far East and Europe, high-speed rail is used extensively for passenger travel. Freight trains are composed of wagons or trucks rather than carriages, though some parcel and mail trains (especially <b>Travelling</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Offices)</b> are outwardly more like {{passenger train}}s.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>travelling</b> <b>post</b> <b>office</b> service resumed on 28 March 1927. Its last run was on 14 May 1966. An {{official}} note c.1954 {{stated that}} [...] "passenger trains between Kingston and Montego Bay (TPO 1) and Kingston and Port Antonio (TPO 2) are each {{equipped with a}} post office with a postman in charge. There is a letter-box at each station which the train postman clears en route." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{a railway}} post office, {{commonly}} abbreviated as RPO, was a railroad {{car that was}} normally operated in passenger service {{as a means to}} sort mail en route, in order to speed delivery. [...] The RPO was staffed by highly trained Railway Mail Service postal clerks, and was off-limits to the passengers on the train. [...] In the UK and Ireland, the equivalent term was <b>Travelling</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> (TPO).|$|E
2500|$|The New Plymouth Express was a {{passenger}} express train {{operated by the}} New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) between Wellington and New Plymouth. [...] It ran from 1886 until 1955 and was sometimes known as the New Plymouth Mail due to the Railway <b>Travelling</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> carriages included in its consist. [...] The Express was notable amongst NZR's provincial expresses as being both the first and, until the commencement of the Gisborne Express in 1942, the longest in distance travelled.|$|E
50|$|Like baggage cars, railway <b>post</b> <b>office</b> (RPO; US term) cars or <b>travelling</b> <b>post</b> <b>offices</b> (TPOs; British term) {{were not}} {{accessible}} to paying passengers. These cars' interiors were designed with sorting facilities that were often seen {{and used in}} conventional <b>post</b> <b>offices</b> around the world. The RPO is where mail was sorted while the train was en route. Because these cars carried mail, which often included valuables or quantities of cash and checks, the RPO staff (who were employed by the postal service and not the railroad) were the only train crews allowed to carry guns. The RPO cars were normally placed in a passenger train between the train's motive power and baggage cars, further inhibiting their access by passengers.|$|R
25|$|Initially all {{the postal}} {{facilities}} had {{the status of}} relay stations, and letters received their postmarks only at the Beirut <b>post</b> <b>office,</b> with one exception: markings Djebel Lubnan {{are believed to have}} been applied at the relay station Staura (Lebanon). In the 1860s, most relay stations were promoted to the status of branch <b>post</b> <b>offices</b> and received postmarks, initially only negative seals, of their own. The postmarks of an office's postal section usually contained the words posta shubesi, as opposed to telegraf hanei for the telegraph section. In 1860, ten postal facilities operated in Palestine, rising to 20 in 1900 and 32 in 1917. <b>Travelling</b> <b>post</b> <b>offices</b> existed on three routes: Jaffa–Jerusalem, Damascus–Haifa, and Messudshi—Nablus. No TPO postmarks are known for other railway lines.|$|R

2500|$|Britain's Royal Mail {{commissioned}} {{and built}} the first <b>Travelling</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> cars in the late 1840s as well. [...] These cars resembled coaches in their short wheelbase and exterior design, but were equipped with nets {{on the sides of}} the cars to catch mail bags while the train was in motion. [...] American RPOs, first appearing in the 1860s, also featured equipment to catch mail bags at speed, but the American design more closely resembled a large hook that would catch the mailbag in its crook. [...] When not in use, the hook would swivel down against the side of the car to prevent it from catching obstacles.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 December 1908 the WMR was {{acquired}} by NZR, although the already established practice of through running meant this acquisition {{had little effect on}} the Express, except for some changes to the Railway <b>Travelling</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> and the north- and southbound trains crossing at Marton rather than Longburn. [...] A more dramatic change for the Express was the 1908 opening of the North Island Main Trunk Railway, providing a more direct and quicker route between Wellington and Auckland than the combination of the Express and Onehunga steamship. [...] Another change was forced on the train in 1917 by restrictions due to World War I: refreshment stops were re-introduced when the dining cars were withdrawn, never to return.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Travelling</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> (TPO) was {{a type of}} {{mail train}} in Great Britain where the post was sorted en route. The last <b>Travelling</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> {{services}} were ended on 9 January 2004, with the carriages used now sold for scrap or to preservation societies.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> Investigation Branch (IB) {{recommended}} the fitting of alarms to all <b>Travelling</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> with HVP carriages. This recommendation was implemented in 1961, but HVP carriages without alarms were retained in reserve. By August 1963, three HVP carriages were equipped with alarms, bars over {{the windows and}} bolts and catches on the doors, {{but at the time}} of the robbery, these carriages were out of service, so a reserve carriage (M30204M) without those features had to be used. The fitting of radios was also considered, but they were deemed to be too expensive, and the measure was not implemented. This carriage was kept for evidence for seven years following the event and then burned at a scrapyard in Norfolk in the presence of police and <b>post</b> <b>office</b> officials to deter any souvenir hunters.|$|R

50|$|As {{described}} by Hollingshead, mail vans in the United Kingdom were originally horse-drawn, operating {{in conjunction with}} the railway network, including <b>Travelling</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Offices,</b> carrying mail between railway stations and places distant from them, and between sub-post offices and sorting offices. Some of these vans were of the Brougham type. In the 1880s the General <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> began hiring larger enclosed box vans from McNamara & Company. These vans had elliptical spring front suspension, semi-elliptical spring rear suspension, a double driving seat, and mail coach style headlamps. These were frequently called mail coaches, although unlike actual mail coaches they carried no passengers. At least six regular long-distance, i.e., not just to and from local railway stations, mail van services out of London existed in the late 19th century. A London-to-Chatham mail van service ran until the summer of 1908, and one mail van service ran from London to Oxford until 1909.|$|R
