25|$|In the 16th century, Duarte Barbosa {{noted that}} many ships from the Kingdom of Cambaya in modern-day India sailed to Mogadishu with cloth and spices, {{for which they}} in return {{received}} gold, wax and ivory. Barbosa also highlighted the abundance of meat, wheat, barley, horses, and fruit on the coastal markets, which generated enormous wealth for the merchants. Mogadishu, {{the center of a}} thriving textile industry known as toob benadir (specialized for the markets in Egypt, among other places), together with Merca and Barawa, also served as a <b>transit</b> <b>stop</b> for Swahili merchants from Mombasa and Malindi and for the gold trade from Kilwa. Jewish merchants from the Hormuz brought their Indian textile and fruit to the Somali coast in exchange for grain and wood.|$|E

25|$|In October 2000, in {{violation}} of an order not to leave Moscow, Litvinenko and his family travelled to Turkey, possibly via Ukraine. While in Turkey, Litvinenko applied for asylum at the United States Embassy in Ankara, but his application was denied. With the help of Alexander Goldfarb, Litvinenko bought air tickets for the Istanbul-London-Moscow flight, and asked for political asylum at Heathrow Airport during the <b>transit</b> <b>stop</b> on 1 November 2000. Political asylum was granted on 14 May 2001, not because of his knowledge on intelligence matters, according to Litvinenko, but rather on humanitarian grounds. While in London he became a journalist for Chechenpress and an author. He also joined Berezovsky in campaigning against Putin's government. In October 2006 he became a naturalised British citizen with residence in Whitehaven.|$|E
25|$|Emirates has {{steadily}} captured traffic from South Asia to North America, allowing passengers {{to bypass the}} hubs of British Airways, Lufthansa, and Air France, with a <b>transit</b> <b>stop</b> at Dubai International Airport instead. South Asia has remained an important region for the Emirates network. Pakistan was the first country to receive flights and since then, Emirates operates to five destinations in the country. India was the second country to receive flights from Emirates, and Emirates is expanding its network there. Emirates is the largest airline operating internationally in India and operates over 185 flights a week across 10 cities. Similarly, Emirates competes with British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, Philippine Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways International, Middle Eastern rivals Etihad Airways, Saudia and Qatar Airways, and other airlines on the lucrative London to Sydney Kangaroo Route.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{accessibility}} with public transportation in the case of the Umeå Region in northern Sweden. This is done by GIS network analysis where both access to <b>transit</b> <b>stops,</b> as well as access by public transport from stops to destinations is examined. An accessibility index is created from transit frequency and travel times to destinations. The results is compared with population register data to calculate what shares of the population has which levels of accessibility with public transportation. In the Umeå Region there are different levels of accessibility by public transport for different parts of the region, where <b>transit</b> <b>stops</b> in the most densely populated areas has the highest levels of accessibility, as well as stations along the railroads. The share of the population with access to public transportation is considerably smaller than with car. To make buses and trains more competitive their accessibility will have to increase. Access to public services is also examined in relation to <b>transit</b> <b>stops.</b> Information about accessibility with public transportation, access to <b>transit</b> <b>stops</b> and the amount of public services provided is used to find suitable locations for commuter parking. The study provides information needed for local transport planning and urban planning to increase the accessibility with public transportation as well as it proposes a methodology to analyze public transportation accessibility by GIS. ...|$|R

30|$|Similar {{conclusions}} are made also by Beimborn et al. [6] about {{the requirements for}} successful transit. Land use design could be sensitive to transit needs to develop “transit corridors” divided by 0.4 – 0.8  km from the automobile networks, in order to separate the automobile oriented land-use from the transit oriented land-use. Such areas would have a mix of land uses and higher densities to reach a concentration of trip ends along the transit service, with a high quality access system to <b>transit</b> <b>stops.</b> The importance of a high quality access system to <b>transit</b> <b>stops</b> is underlined also by Schlossberg and Brown [19].|$|R
