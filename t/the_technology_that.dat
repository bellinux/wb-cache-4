5|$|A {{localized}} {{earthquake in}} New York City damages only one building, killing nearly all inside. The Fringe team discovers {{that a second}} building appeared at the same location as the first, fusing the structure and people inside together. Walter (John Noble) realizes that the second building has been pulled from the parallel universe by Thomas Jerome Newton, using <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> Walter and William Bell had discovered years ago. Walter warns that because of conservation of mass, a building of similar mass will be taken from the prime universe to the parallel one {{sometime in the next}} few days.|$|E
5|$|Fabry-Pérot etalons {{are widely}} used in telecommunications, lasers and {{spectroscopy}} to control and measure the wavelengths of light. Dichroic filters are multiple layer thin-film etalons. In telecommunications, wavelength-division multiplexing, <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> {{enables the use of}} multiple wavelengths of light through a single optical fiber, depends on filtering devices that are thin-film etalons. Single-mode lasers employ etalons to suppress all optical cavity modes except the single one of interest.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium's unique {{radioactive}} characteristics {{allowed it}} to be traced as it moved through various compounds in chemical reactions, at first {{this was the only}} method available to prove that its chemistry was different from other elements. As the first isotope of neptunium to be discovered has such a short half-life, McMillan and Abelson were unable to prepare a sample that was large enough to perform chemical analysis of the new element using <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> was then available. However, after the discovery of the long-lived 237Np isotope in 1942 by Glenn Seaborg and Arthur Wahl, forming weighable amounts of neptunium became a realistic endeavor. Its half-life was initially determined to be about 3millionyears (later revised to 2.144millionyears), confirming the predictions of Nishina and Kimura of a very long half-life.|$|E

The movie is jammed a second time by an Artemian who tells the player that Terran progression was responsible for 68% of all alien mortalities during the past three centuries and that the reason for this high percentage is due to megacorporations such as TetraCorp.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2003 {{the team}} was {{contacted}} by LucasArts president Simon Jeffrey, who requested that Obsidian make an action role-playing game set in the Star Wars universe. The team suggested a game concept which featured first-person lightsaber melee combat and that included established characters like R2-D2. Their idea was rejected, and Jeffrey instead asked Obsidian to create a follow-up to the BioWare-developed , as the team at Obsidian was familiar with <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> the original game used. The partnership between the two companies finalized in late 2003, {{and development of the}} game, which became , began in October 2003. Obsidian was given 15 months to develop The Sith Lords. Originally set for a holiday 2004 release, LucasArts gave the studio an extension into 2005, before shifting the release date back to holiday 2004 following the Electronic Entertainment Expo. While LucasArts did dispatch members of its own staff to help get the game out on time, a number of features wound up being cut due to time constraints. Due to the moved deadline, Obsidian also did not have enough time to polish the game, and The Sith Lords suffered from crashes and other technical issues. Despite its issues, The Sith Lords was released to positive critical reception. The cut features were eventually restored by modders, who began their effort in 2009 and finished in 2012.|$|E

25|$|None {{of these}} systems are perfect. For example, they are {{unreliable}} at extremes of age (e.g. neonates, infants or the very elderly). Secondly, certain agents, such as nitrous oxide, may produce anesthesia without reducing {{the value of the}} depth monitor. This is because the molecular action of these agents (NMDA receptor antagonists) differs from that of more conventional agents, and they suppress cortical EEG activity less. Thirdly, they are prone to interference from other biological potentials (such as EMG), or external electrical signals (such as electrosurgery). This means that <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> will reliably monitor depth of anesthesia for every patient and every anesthetic does not yet exist.|$|E

25|$|Stevens, in {{his initial}} draft, {{expressed}} great {{concern with the}} possibility that an individual might be liable for copyright infringement for copying a single program in his own home, and for his own use. At the same time, Justice Brennan was wavering on affirming based {{on the presence of}} non-infringing uses of the technology—but Brennan was not prepared to say that making home copies for repeated personal use did not constitute an infringement. Justice White, noting Brennan's position, suggested that Stevens shift the basis of his opinion away from arguments about whether home-use was, in fact, an infringement. White pointed out that the issue need not be resolved, because the suit was not against home-users, but against the producers of <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> enabled them.|$|E
