40|$|International audienceHerein, {{we report}} on a three-component supra {{molecular}} hybrid system built from specific recognition processes involving a Dawson-type polyoxometalate (POM),P 2 W 18 O 62](6 -), a cationic electron-rich cluster [Ta 6 Br 12 (H 2 O) (6) ](2 +), and gamma-cyclodextrin (gamma-CD). Such materials have been investigated using a bottom-up approach by studying the specific interactions between gamma-CD and both types of inorganic units. Their ability to interact has been investigated in the solid state by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in solution using multinuclear NMR methods (including DOSY, EXSY, and COSY), electrospray ionization mass and UV-vis spectroscopies, electrochemistry, and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments. Single-crystal XRD analysis reveals that POM:gamma-CD constitutes a highly versatile system which gives aggregates with 1 : 1, 1 : 2, and 1 : 3 stoichiometry. Surprisingly, these arrangements exhibit a common feature wherein the gamma-CD moiety interacts with the Dawson-type POMs through its primary face. We present also the first structural model involving an octahedral-type metallic cluster with gamma-CD. XRD study reveals that the cationic [Ta 6 Br 12 (H 2 O) (6) ](2 +) ion is closely embedded within two gamma-CD units to give a supramolecular ditopic cation, suitable {{to be used as}} a linker within extended structure. Solution study demonstrates clearly that pre-associations exist in solution, for which binding constants and thermodynamic parameters have been determined, giving preliminary arguments about the chaotropic nature of the inorganic ions. Finally, both building blocks, i. e., the ditopic supramolecular cation {[Ta 6 Br 12 (H 2 O) (6) ]@ 2 CD}(2 +) and the Dawson-type anion, react together to give a three-component, well-ordered hybrid material derived either as a supramolecular hydrogel or single crystals. The solid-state structure shows an unprecedented helicoidal <b>tubular</b> <b>chain</b> resulting from the periodic alternation of POM and supramolecular cation, featuring short hydrogen-bonding contacts between the electron-poor POM and electron-rich cluster. The 1 D tubular ionic polymer observed in the single crystals should make it possible to understand the long-range ordering observed within the hydrogel hybrid material. The supramolecular chemical complementarities between the gamma-CD-based ditopic cation and POM open a wide scope for the design of hybrid materials that accumulate synergistic functionalities...|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} and the assembly of tris-(2, 2 '-dioxy-binaphthyl) cyclotriphosphazene {(+) -[N 3 P 3 (O 2 C 20 H 12) (3) ], DBNP, in the solid amorphous state was studied using molecular dynamics (MD) including ad hoc quantum mechanically derived force field (FF) parameters, {{in combination with the}} energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDXD) technique. The atom-atom radial distribution function (RDF) curve obtained through the EDXD experiment revealed low intensity peaks not attributable to the intramolecular distances of the single molecule, but clearly featuring a low energy state of long-distance three-dimensional assembly. The radial distribution functions (RDF) were calculated for various models of DBNP submitted to theoretical MD simulations. Based on the comparison of theoretically calculated RDFs and those obtained from the EDXD experiment, the predominant structural motif of the material in the bulk was found to have DBNP molecules laid one upon the other to form tubular nanostructures. These contain eight DBNP units each (length ca. 46 Angstrom) with two and three of these units aligned in parallel and held together. The material can be represented as a bulk of <b>tubular</b> snake-like <b>chains</b> undergoing distortions with a step of eight DBNP units. The bending angles, that vary randomly, attain limited values sufficient to induce disorder and thus nonperiodic structure.

40|$|Denisovite {{is a rare}} mineral {{occurring}} as aggregates of fibres typically 200 – 500  nm diameter. It {{was confirmed}} as a new mineral in 1984, but important facts about its chemical formula, lattice parameters, symmetry and structure have remained incompletely known since then. Recently obtained results from studies using microprobe analysis, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), electron crystallography, modelling and Rietveld refinement will be reported. The electron crystallography methods include transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected-area electron diffraction (SAED), high-angle annular dark-field imaging (HAADF), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), precession electron diffraction (PED) and electron diffraction tomography (EDT). A structural model of denisovite was developed from HAADF images and later completed {{on the basis of}} quasi-kinematic EDT data by ab initio structure solution using direct methods and least-squares refinement. The model was confirmed by Rietveld refinement. The lattice parameters are a = 31. 024  (1), b = 19. 554  (1) and c = 7. 1441  (5)  Å, β = 95. 99  (3) °, V = 4310. 1  (5)  Å 3 and space group P 12 /a 1. The structure consists of three topologically distinct dreier silicate chains, viz. two xonotlite-like dreier double chains, [Si 6 O 17] 10 −, and a tubular loop-branched dreier triple chain, [Si 12 O 30] 12 −. The silicate chains occur between three walls of edge-sharing (Ca,Na) octahedra. The chains of silicate tetrahedra and the octahedra walls extend parallel to the z axis and form a layer parallel to (100). Water molecules and K+ cations are located at the centre of the <b>tubular</b> silicate <b>chain.</b> The latter also occupy positions close to the centres of eight-membered rings in the silicate chains. The silicate chains are geometrically constrained by neighbouring octahedra walls and present an ambiguity with respect to their z position along these walls, with displacements between neighbouring layers being either Δz = c/ 4 or −c/ 4. Such behaviour is typical for polytypic sequences and leads to disorder along [100]. In fact, the diffraction pattern does not show any sharp reflections with l odd, but continuous diffuse streaks parallel to a* instead. Only reflections with l even are sharp. The diffuse scattering is caused by (100) nanolamellae separated by stacking faults and twin boundaries. The structure can be described according to the order–disorder (OD) theory as a stacking of layers parallel to (100) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Being able {{to segment}} the {{esophagus}} without user interaction from 3 -D CT data is of high value to radiologists during oncological examinations of the mediastinum. The segmentation {{can serve as}} a guideline and prevent confusion with pathological tissue. However, limited contrast to surrounding structures and versatile shape and appearance make segmentation a challenging problem. This paper presents a multi-step method: First, a detector that is trained to learn a discriminative model of the appearance is combined with an explicit model of the distribution of respiratory and esophageal air. In the next step, prior shape knowledge is incorporated using a Markov chain model. We follow a “detect and connect ” approach to obtain the maximum a posteriori estimate of the approximate esophagus shape from hypothesis about the esophagus contour in axial image slices. Finally, the surface of this approximation is non-rigidly deformed to better fit the boundary of the organ. The method is compared to an alternative approach that uses a particle filter instead of a Markov chain to infer the approximate esophagus shape, to the performance of a human observer and also to state of the art methods, which are all semiautomatic. Cross-validation on 144 CT scans showed that the Markov chain based approach clearly outperforms the particle filter. It segments the esophagus with a mean error of 1. 80 mm in less than 16 s on a standard PC. This is only 1 mm above the inter observer variability and can compete with the results of previously published semiautomatic methods.
