5|$|From {{the late}} 1970s through the mid-1990s the {{laboratory}} was rededicated to medical and urban entomology, with Professor John Edman running projects on mosquitos as vectors and Professor Ron Prokopy focusing on orchard pest control. In 1982, the wintering cellar {{in the basement}} of the lab was converted into laboratories, and the workshop was relocated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> adjacent to the building that was constructed that same year.|$|E
5000|$|Busch {{dominated}} the Bristol race in August. He led 57% {{of the whole}} race leading for 252 of the first 419 laps. However, Busch began having handling problems during the final quarter of the race and {{it was enough to}} send him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>garages.</b> On his way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>garages,</b> however, Busch got t-boned by a crashing Justin Allgaier, driving a one-off race for HScott Motorsports, taking him out of the race. Busch expressed discontent with Allgaier and Allgaier's spotter in his post-race interview, calling them [...] "The biggest morons out there." ...|$|R
50|$|Ecclesmachan {{had some}} {{improvements}} made in 2009; {{there was a}} refurbishment made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>garages</b> after they were found to contain asbestos; West Lothian council paid <b>to</b> get <b>the</b> <b>garages</b> redone, and after 2-3 months <b>the</b> <b>garages</b> were finished. Other improvements included getting a Basketball net put in the local park and getting a Rugby field put up; the field it is in is closer to Oatridge College than <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village itself, but was made for <b>the</b> villagers <b>to</b> use.|$|R

5|$|In 1990, a {{bas-relief}} {{of influential}} San Franciscans was sculpted over {{the facade of}} 235 Pine Street, a 26-story skyscraper. Timothy L. Pflueger was the only architect among those memorialized. In 2008, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to {{change the name of}} Chelsea Place, a small alley leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> of the 450 Sutter Street building, to Timothy Pflueger Place.|$|E
5|$|In August 2016, the MBTA began a $6.1 million {{improvement}} {{project at}} the station. The work includes drainage improvements, sidewalk and cobblestone replacement, stair and elevator repairs, painting of the garage structure to prevent rust, structural repairs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage,</b> expansion joint replacement, and platform repairs. It {{is expected to be}} completed by November 2016.|$|E
5|$|On lap 22, {{the green}} flag waved, as Tony Stewart led Kurt Busch, Jimmie Johnson, Juan Pablo Montoya, and Kasey Kahne on the restart. Stewart dropped to third after being passed by Kurt Busch and Montoya. Two laps later, Joe Nemechek went to garage with {{electrical}} problems. On lap 26, Jimmie Johnson {{moved into the}} third position after passing Montoya. By lap 27, Kurt Busch had a two-second lead over Tony Stewart. Johnson, Stewart and Kahne were battling three-wide for the second position on lap 30. One lap later, Nemechek returned to the track after having electrical problems. On lap 33, the top-five positions were single file with Kurt Busch in first, Kahne in second, Johnson in third, Denny Hamlin in fourth and Stewart in fifth. A lap later, Bobby Labonte went to garage because of overheating problems. On lap 37, Landon Cassill went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> with rear gear problems. Afterward, on lap 41, J.J.

5|$|As dusk {{began to}} fall on the drying track, the No. 8 Peugeot {{suffered}} from rear wheel hub failures which required two lengthy visits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage.</b> This allowed the No. 1 Audi to take over second place. Jacques Villeneuve's No. 7 Peugeot also lost time, which dropped it to two laps behind the No. 2 Audi. The No. 1 Audi had its own brief moment when the No. 63 Corvette clipped the Audi's rear end. The Corvette was forced to take evasive action through the Dunlop Chicane's gravel trap, and the Audi required replacement rear bodywork on its next pit stop.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the MBTA spent {{slightly}} less than $100,000 to rehabilitate the deteriorated garage and to convert the drop-off lane into a full busway with shelters, benches, and signage. The busway opened on September 9, 2003 and 21 MBTA Bus routes were rerouted from Central Square. In late 2005, the MBTA spent $168,000 for repairs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> roof, which frequently leaked during rain. The 1992 station was built with new concrete ties supporting the tracks connecting to the station, which proved less durable than expected. In September 2008, the MBTA board authorized a $1 million tie replacement and slope stabilization project at the station.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, {{the station}} owners {{sent a letter}} of concern to the state, seeking that the Environmental Impact Report for the museum and {{footbridge}} consider a breadth of possible impacts, particularly from the footbridge. The museum itself received a Finding Of No Significant Impact in March 2014. The Environmental Impact Evaluation for the footbridge, released in July 2014, analyzed seven alternatives for the footbridge location. Alternative 5a, located east of the baggage building and including a section <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage,</b> was the preferred alternative. The state committed $20 million towards {{the cost of the}} potential footbridge.|$|E

5|$|Jackson {{continued}} to lead Air Defence Headquarters in Madang following {{the end of}} hostilities, before his commission was terminated in Brisbane on 8February 1946. Returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> business in rural Queensland, he ran Active Service Motors at Roma and Western Queensland Motors in St George. He married Cynthia Molle at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Southport, on 25January 1947; the couple had three sons. Predeceased by his wife in 1974, Jackson died of a cerebral hemorrhage at Southport on 17February 1980. He was survived by his children, and cremated in an Anglican ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The No. 9 Audi {{began to}} fall off the race pace after {{multiple}} visits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> for repairs to its hybrid system, but the No. 7 Audi kept fighting as Lotterer reset the fastest lap of the race with a three minutes and 17.476 seconds time. KCMG had an anxious moment when Lapierre missed the Indianapolis corner, but recovered with marshal assistance without losing the LMP2 class lead. The No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari slowed on course and came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> with gearbox issues, handing the LMGTE Pro lead back to Corvette and allowing the No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari to climb to second place after recovering from its earlier issues. Vanthoor drove his car into his pitbox with gearbox problems but his team were unable to repair it before the race's conclusion and retired. Jann Mardenborough's Nissan {{came to a halt}} at the Porsche Curves after smoke bellowed out of {{the front of the car}} as the gearbox failed, leaving Nissan with a single car left circulating. Light rain {{began to fall}} on portions of the circuit in the final hour, but it was not heavy enough to affect the race. Dalla Lana, having led the previous 125 laps in LMGTE Am and within forty five minutes of the race finish, went straight on at the Ford Chicane and crashed heavily into an outside tyre barrier, ending the car's run and promoting the SMP Ferrari to the class lead which it held to the finish. Dalla Lana was unhurt.|$|E
5|$|The rain {{eventually}} became heavier, making the conditions treacherous and bringing the safety car back out. This put a temporary stop {{to the battle}} between Aston Martin and Corvette for first and {{second place in the}} GT1 class. The second place Corvette had been quicker in the wet conditions, but it was not allowed to further close on the Aston Martin during the safety period. After problems for both of the Barazi-Epsilon LMP2s, Binnie Motorsports brought its class leading LMP2 car <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> to ensure that the car was prepared for the weather and could hold on to the lead until the finish.|$|E
25|$|These garages {{often have}} low ceiling clearances, which {{restrict}} access by full-size vans {{and other large}} vehicles. On 15 December 2013, a man was killed during a robbery in <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> at <b>The</b> Mall at Short Hills in Millburn, New Jersey. <b>The</b> ambulance responding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shooting was delayed {{because it was too}} large <b>to</b> enter <b>the</b> <b>garage.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{fire had}} swept through <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> area on <b>the</b> {{morning of the}} 1941 race, {{destroying}} the car of George Barringer, and burning down {{about a third of}} the southern bank of garages. About a month later, plans were drafted <b>to</b> rebuild <b>the</b> <b>garages,</b> and <b>the</b> work was done at some point during the summer and fall of 1941.|$|R
5|$|Hamilton {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} {{practice}} on Friday afternoon, while Rosberg was unable to partake due to a water leak on his car. Hamilton's time of 1:31.660 was over three-tenths of a second faster than that of second places Daniel Ricciardo. Fellow Red Bull driver Max Verstappen was third, ahead of Vettel, all within one second of the fastest time. Ferrari split their practice strategy, with Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen running the hard-compound tyre early in the session, while Vettel used the softer medium compound, before both switched to the soft tyres. At their home race, McLaren had a mixed session. While Fernando Alonso placed a good sixth, teammate Jenson Button had to take <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> for repairs twice, before coming out on track again late in the session, eventually setting the ninth fastest time. Daniil Kvyat was 13th fastest, but damaged his front wing when he went over a kerb at Club corner.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{plans for}} an {{underground}} garage at Union Square were given to Pflueger for political reasons. George Applegarth's 1935 design was actively opposed from several directions and Pflueger's social contacts and his friendship with mayor Angelo Joseph Rossi were {{needed to get the}} project started. Union Square garage opened in 1943 with Pflueger's touch making it a full-service valet garage complete with a waiting room and rest rooms for shoppers and the option of having shopping packages sent directly from a nearby store <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> or for the car to be delivered to the store. The concept of an underground garage below a city park was influential: New York builder Robert Moses requested copies of Pflueger's plans (little changed from Applegarth's) and Pershing Square in Los Angeles was excavated and rebuilt in 1952 along the same lines.|$|E
5|$|On the forty-eighth lap, {{debris in}} turn two {{brought out the}} second caution. Robby Gordon and David Gilliland stayed out while the other teams made pit stops. Gordon and Gilliand made pit stops the next lap and gave the lead to Kurt Busch. Kurt Busch brought the field to the green flag with Hamlin in second, Montoya in third, Johnson in fourth, and Kahne in fifth on lap 51. After Hamlin made a good restart he passed Kurt Busch on lap 52. Afterward, on lap 54, Landon Cassill {{returned}} to the track while J.J. Yeley returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage.</b> Kahne passed Montoya for the third position. After 67 laps, Hamlin had a 2.4second lead over Kurt Busch in the second position. On lap 87, green flag pit stops began. One lap later, most drivers in the first ten positions made pit stops. Denny Hamlin, {{who was in the}} first position, came to pit road on lap 92, but had problems leaving which gave Kurt Busch the lead.|$|E

Mason told TV Week that he thinks it is a shame Chris and Blake cannot continue their friendship because of Warren and his views. It soon becomes clear someone is spying on Chris, but whether it is Warren or someone else is not clear. Mason added something big would happen and it may not end well for Chris.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} {{approached}} its halfway point, Lotterer gained on the No. 9 Audi {{and moved into}} second place, becoming Audi's lead challenger to Porsche. After leaving the pit lane, Pierre Ragues's No. 43 Morand car billowed smoke because of an oil pressure sensor failure and his vehicle caught fire, causing him to retire at Arnage corner. Several LMGTE cars {{took the opportunity to}} change brake discs {{at this point in the}} morning, including Fernando Rees in the No. 99 Aston Martin. Returning to the track Rees' car failed to stop in time for the first Mulsanne Straight chicane and hit the rear of the TDS Racing Oreca-Nissan. The Oreca, which had held second place in the LMP2 category, was abandoned in the gravel at the chicane while Rees limped the damaged Aston Martin back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> for repairs to its front-left corner. The No. 26 G-Drive Ligier took over second place in LMP2, although still a lap behind the leading KCMG Oreca while the lead in LMGTE Pro was now left to Jordan Taylor's No. 64 Corvette and the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari of Bruni on the same lap. In the early morning the No. 7 Audi's hold on second place was relinquished when the right-rear bodywork of the car came apart on the circuit and littered debris at the Porsche Curves, requiring a seven-minute stop for repairs and dropping the car down the race order.|$|E
