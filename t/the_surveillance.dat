40|$|Background: For {{the purpose}} of {{minimizing}} the HIV/AIDS epidemic effects, one of the programs is the promotion of scientific methods and setting of <b>the</b> suitable <b>surveillance</b> systems. <b>The</b> present research was conducted to design <b>the</b> HIV/AIDS <b>surveillance</b> system in Iran applying WHO recommendations {{and the experience of}} some countries. Methods: In 2009, based on the country's requirements, <b>the</b> HIV/AIDS <b>surveillance</b> system was proposed and designed for Iran. The Delphi technique was utilized to find the views of experts. Data analysis was conducted based on a comparison of the attributes of <b>the</b> HIV/AIDS <b>surveillance</b> systems in <b>the</b> countries under considera-tion using a descriptive and theoretical analysis.
