He's big, but he has a really good swing. It's not like a big guy. It's short, compact. It's not just the home runs. The guy has a pretty good idea how to hit.|$|E
25|$|A spinners weasel {{is similar}} to a swift, however it does not adjust to various sized hanks. While today <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> disadvantage, as {{different}} manufacturers don't always make hanks the same size, it was not an issue when all yarn was hand spun. At this time hanks from one spinner would all be the same size, as they would have been made on the same niddy noddy, thus only one diameter was needed.|$|E
25|$|From the {{application}} protocol point of view, TLS {{belongs to a}} lower layer, although the TCP/IP model is too coarse to show it. This means that the TLS handshake is usually (except in the STARTTLS case) performed before {{the application}} protocol can start. In the name-based virtual server feature being provided by the application layer, all co-hosted virtual servers share the same certificate because the server has to select and send a certificate immediately after the ClientHello message. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> problem in hosting environments because it means either sharing the same certificate among all customers or using a different IP address for each of them.|$|E

Daniel Radcliffe, star of the Harry Potter film series, guest starred as Edmund in the third segment which parodies the Twilight novel and film series. Radcliffe said that he is a fan of the show and guest starring is [...] "a huge honour. The Halloween episode has become a big tradition in The Simpsons so I'm very excited to be part of it. There was a time when I was 12 or 13 when 50 percent of everything I knew about the world came from The Simpsons, so <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> deal."

500|$|Liverpool manager Benítez was {{confident}} that victory in the match would provide his side with a boost ahead of their opening match of the 2006–07 Premier League with Sheffield United: [...] "This {{will give us a}} lot of confidence I am sure, to play one of the best sides in the world and to beat them, this should give us more confidence going into what will be an interesting season." [...] He also defended his decision to players such as Gerrard and Alonso on the bench: [...] "It was my idea to start with the players that had the most fitness and have played the most minutes. Then I wanted to bring the other players on towards the end. It worked and it showed that we have a great squad – better than last season." [...] Crouch, scorer of the winning goal, was also confident the result would boost the Liverpool squad: [...] "There is a bit of rivalry between the sides and it is great to get an early one over them. Make no bones about it, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> game to win and it certainly could give us a psychological edge this season." ...|$|E

500|$|Following the race, Démare {{expressed}} delight at his victory, saying: [...] "There {{are days}} {{like this one}} in which everything works despite the occasional hiccup, like crashing {{at the bottom of the}} Cipressa.

I'm extremely happy." [...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E
500|$|After the season, {{head coach}} Lloyd Carr was {{replaced}} by Rich Rodriguez. [...] Rodriguez' no huddle spread option offense, which used zone blocking, was a major adjustment for Boren. By the tenth day of spring practice Boren had left the team. Boren made {{a statement to the}} press regarding his decision, which included the following excerpt: [...] "Michigan football was a family, built on mutual respect and support for each other from (former) Coach (Lloyd) Carr on down. We knew it took the entire family, a team effort, and we all worked together[...] I have great trouble accepting that those family values have eroded in just a few months[...] [...]That I am unable to perform under these circumstances at the level I expect of myself, and my teammates and Michigan fans deserve, is why I have made the decision to leave." [...] A month later, Ohio State coach Jim Tressel announced Boren would redshirt for the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season and become the first player to transfer from Michigan to play for archrival Ohio State since at least World War II. [...] According to Section 14.5.2.B of the Rules of Eligibility in the Big Ten handbook, Boren is ineligible to be a scholarship athlete after transferring. [...] A little more than a week after Justin announced his transfer, his younger brother Zach committed to Ohio State. [...] Later that summer, Detroit Free Press writer Michael Rosenberg, backed up Boren's statement about family values: [...] "Rodriguez's staff uses some of the foulest, most degrading language imaginable. I know coaches curse, and I'm no prude, but this goes way beyond a few dirty words. He belittles his players. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> part of why offensive lineman Justin Boren [...] left the team. He felt his dignity was at stake." ...|$|E

2500|$|To fix {{carbon dioxide}} into sugar {{molecules}} {{in the process}} of photosynthesis, chloroplasts use an enzyme called RuBisCO. RuBisCO has a problem—it has trouble distinguishing between carbon dioxide and oxygen, so at high oxygen concentrations, RuBisCO starts accidentally adding oxygen to sugar precursors. This has the end result of ATP energy being wasted and [...] being released, all with no sugar being produced. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> problem, since O is produced by the initial light reactions of photosynthesis, causing issues down the line in the Calvin cycle which uses RuBisCO.|$|E

Giammarinaro was interviewed by UK's Observer in 2013 {{on the occasion of the}} release of her Recommendations, stating that [...] "any people including children are trafficked exactly for this purpose, for example pickpocketing or drug cultivation and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> problem because once they commit crimes they are actually treated as criminals".|$|E

Ford was optimistic about that possibility, remarking: [...] "We have made so much headway. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> step forward to prevent a nuclear holocaust."
