In this research, the {{verification}} on {{the torque}} limiter is completed {{by using the}} mechanism of a torque limiter integrated with the infrared optointerrupter feedback detection. Through a shuttle and an infrared optointerrupter, {{it is meant to}} determine whether the rotation mechanism is affected by the mechanism of a torque limiter. With this, it is available to determine if any jamming happens. Through the testing verification of physical mechanisms, the feasibility for the torque limiter proposed by this research is conducted. It can avoid current shorting when dead jamming happens. Also, the detection circuits relevant to the detection of motor current feedback can be saved to reduce systematical circuit maintenance and manufacture <b>torque</b> <b>limiters</b> with long life expectancy, higher stability and low cost...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse the effectiveness of the surgical <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> during operative use. The study also investigates the potential differences in torque between hand and drill-based screw insertion into locking plates using a standardised <b>torque</b> <b>limiter.</b> Methods: <b>Torque</b> for both hand and power screw insertion was measured through a load cell, registering 6. 66 points per second. This was performed in a controlled environment using synthetic bone, a locking plate and locking screws to simulate plate fixation. Screws were inserted by hand and by drill with torque values measured. Results: The surgical <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> (1. 5 Nm) was effective as the highest recorded reading in the study was 1. 409 Nm. Comparatively, there is a statistically significant difference between screw insertion methods. Torque produced for manually driven screw insertion into locking plates was 1. 289 Nm (95 % CI 1. 269 – 1. 308) with drill-powered screw insertion at 0. 740 Nm (95 % CI 0. 723 – 0. 757). Conclusions: The surgical <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> proved to be effective as per product specifications. Screws inserted under power produce significantly less torque when compared to manual insertion by hand. This is likely related to the mechanism of the <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> when being used at higher speeds for which it was designed. We conclude that screws may be inserted using power to the plate with the addition of a <b>torque</b> <b>limiter.</b> It is recommended that all screws inserted by drill be hand tightened to achieve adequate torque values.

40|$|Contactless {{mechanical}} components are mechanical sets for conversion of torque/speed, whose gears and moving parts {{do not touch}} each other, but rather they provide movement with magnets and magnetic materials that exert force from a certain distance. Magneto-mechanical transmission devices have several advantages over conventional mechanisms: no friction between rotatory elements (no power losses or heat generation by friction so increase of efficiency), no lubrication is needed (oil-free mechanisms and no lubrication auxiliary systems), reduced maintenance (no lubricant so no need of oil replacements), wider operational temperature ranges (no lubricant evaporation or freezing), overload protection (if overload occurs magnet simply slides but no teeth brake), through-wall connection (decoupling of thermal and electrical paths and environmental isolation), larger operative speeds (more efficient operative conditions), ultralow noise and vibrations (no contact no noise generation). All these advantages permit us to foresee {{in the long term}} several common industrial applications in which including contactless technology would mean a significant breakthrough for their performance. In this work, we present three configurations of contactless mechanical passive components: magnetic gears, magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>limiters</b> and superconducting magnetic bearings. We summarize the main characteristic and range of applications for each type; we show experimental results of the most recent developments showing their performance...|$|E
40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Multisetting Torque Limiter {{will be used}} by astronauts {{during the}} First Servicing Mission STS- 61. It was {{designed}} to replace several individual <b>torque</b> <b>limiters.</b> This replacement reduces the number of tools required as well as reduce the time required for servicing. The Multisetting Torque Limiter design specified five separate torque settings: 2, 5. 3, 9, 35 and 45 ft-lbs. This original units were tested at the 2, 5. 3, and 9 ft-lbs settings and {{did not meet the}} design specifications. The 35 ft-lb and 45 ft-lb torque settings were not incorporated into the original flight design. The objective of the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) redesign effort is to incorporate all five torque settings into a flight design which means the requirements for the first HST Servicing Mission. The first target of the redesign effort focused on the spring chamber and ball detent design. The original design used belleville springs in parallel; the new design changed this configuration to belleville springs stacked in series. The current engineering unit was successfully tested in ambient environment at all five settings. A flight design will soon undergo thermal vacuum testing to evaluate its performance at the temperature extremes...|$|E
40|$|Today’s several {{algorithms}} {{are currently}} {{managed by the}} control units in passenger cars to deliver higher comfort level to vehicle driver and passengers. One route to smoother longitudinal dynamics as well as deliver higher safety {{is provided by the}} engine <b>torque</b> <b>limiters</b> and traction control. The drawback of such filters is that they bring in time delays which may give to the driver the feeling that the vehicle engine does not respond in a prompt way to her/his demand [1]. On the other hand, recent highly-supercharged engines suffer for inadequate engine torque rise when setting the vehicle in motion from stationary with fast accelerator request: this behaviour is related to fueling response, fuel-air ratio control, soot emissions regulation, etc. The goal {{of this paper is to}} design a feedback controller based on multiple Model Predictive Controller (mMPC) to manage the clutch opening/closing operations in a dry-clutch Automated Manual Transmission architecture. The controller aims at ensuring a comfortable vehicle launch by assuring a reduced engagement time and by maintaining the wheel slip at a desired value to have the maximum traction force. The simulations have been carried out by considering the engine dynamics as well as the delay ensuing engine torque build-up together to an imposed wheel slip in fast launch manoeuvre to prove the effectiveness of the proposed clutch control strategy and encourage the development of real-time routines for the testing in real-time environment...|$|E

40|$|Today's {{vehicles}} are quite complex {{as regards the}} automatic control of their operation. Indeed, several algorithms are currently managed by the control units in passenger cars to deliver higher comfort level to vehicle users. One route to smoother longitudinal dynamics {{is provided by the}} engine <b>torque</b> <b>limiters</b> which set the maximum available torque for given operating points of the vehicle. The drawback of such filters is that they bring in time delays which may give to the driver the impression that the vehicle engine does not respond in a prompt way to her/his demand (Rakopoulos & Giakoumis, 2009). On the other hand, recent highly-supercharged engines suffer for inadequate engine torque rise when setting the vehicle in motion from stationary with fast accelerator request: this behaviour is related to fueling response, fuel-air ratio control, soot emissions regulation, etc. In this paper a high order dynamic model of the powertrain system which includes the electro-hydraulic actuator behaviour has been analysed to design a feedback controller based on multiple Model Predictive Controller (mMPC) to manage the clutch opening/closing and gearbox shifting operations in an automated manual transmission based on dry clutch architecture.

50|$|A {{synchronous}} magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> uses {{permanent magnets}} mounted to each shaft, {{with an air}} gap between. They are very fast acting, but may have more backlash than mechanical types.

Mechanical soft starters include clutches and several types of couplings using a fluid, magnetic forces, or steel shot to transmit torque, similar to other forms of <b>torque</b> <b>limiter.</b> Electrical soft starters can be any control system that reduces the torque by temporarily reducing the voltage or current input, or a device that temporarily alters how the motor is connected in the electric circuit.|$|R
30|$|Another {{reflection}} {{from the}} first and final parts is that the simulated vehicle accelerates more quickly than the real one. This is mostly because of the vehicle model: the real vehicle has an active <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> when running unladen to protect the engine and transmission from damage, and the gearshifts are not instantaneous but come with a power disruption. Neither of these effects have been modelled in the vehicle. Recall that the OC-format does not stipulate acceleration in any way.|$|R
50|$|Many {{cordless}} drills incorporate {{this type}} of <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> in a planetary gearset. It may {{be a part of}} an assembly of multiple gearsets used to primarily reduce speed and multiply torque as well as perform ratio changes. The <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> is typically the last gearset in the transmission. It uses the planet carrier as the input with the sun gear as the output, and the annulus normally locked. A series of ball detents act on the annulus to lock it, allowing power to be transmitted from the planet carrier to the sun gear. When the torque transmitted through the gearset reaches a determinate amount, the torque acting on the annulus causes it to unlock from its ball detents and freely rotate, causing power to be diverted from the load on the sun gear to the annulus and thereby stalling the output until torque is reduced to an amount where the ball detents can lock the annulus again. This system equally limits torque in both directions of rotation and also works with the sun gear as the input. The compression of the ball detents (and therefore the amount of torque at which the limiter is utilized) is typically adjusted by means of a rotating collar accessible to the user which is indexed and held in place with its own separate ball detents.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{discusses}} {{the implementation of}} Nonlinear digital PID controller for position controlled electric drive systems. The drawback with PD controller is that it produces a non aperiodic response, when it encounters a maximum torque limit. To overcome this drawback, the nonlinear PD controller is redesigned so to produce aperiodic response. The applicability of PD controller is limited only for the cases of reference input changes, while along with reference input, if disturbance inputs are also considered, the output results in a steady state error (S. S. E), which {{is proportional to the}} disturbance value. To minimize the S. S. E while producing a strong aperiodic response, it is proposed to implement a nonlinear digital PID controller.

500|$|Following the crew's wake up, {{they set}} to work {{preparing}} for the mission's first spacewalk. Grunsfeld and Feustel suited up {{with the assistance of}} their EVA counterparts, Massimino and Good, and the spacewalk officially began when the two switched their suits to battery power at 12:52 UTC. At the start of the spacewalk, Feustel provided managers on the ground with a visual inspection report on the particulate matter seen earlier around the WFC3 box, reporting to the ground team that [...] "I don't really see any of those particles...It's almost imperceivable. I can see some few particles {{on the front of the}} W-SIPE, little, whitish, grey looking, real small. It's low density, too." [...] After getting their tools and equipment for the EVA set up, Grunsfeld and Feustel removed the old Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2, which was installed in 1993 during the telescope's first servicing mission, and replaced it with the new Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3). Feustel initially had trouble removing the bolts from the old camera, which after over fifteen years in space required more torque to remove than expected. After multiple attempts, managers on the ground decided to have Grunsfeld get a contingency <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> from the airlock, which would allow Feustel to apply more force without exceeding a specific point, but the bolt would still not release. The concern was that the bolt would shear, and the camera would be unable to be removed should that happened. Finally, managers approved Feustel to remove the limiter, and apply as much force as he safely thought it would take to release the bolt, which was successful.|$|R
40|$|TheraDrive is an {{effective}} system for post-stroke upper extremity rehabilitation. This system uses off-the-shelf computer gaming wheels with force feedback to help reduce motor impairment and improve function {{in the arms of}} stroke survivors. Preliminary results show that the TheraDrive system lacks a robust mechanical linkage that can withstand the large forces exerted by patients, and it lacks a patient-specific adaptive controller to deliver personalized therapy. It is also not capable of delivering effective therapy to severely low-functioning patients. A new low-cost, high-force haptic robot with a single degree of freedom has been developed to address these concerns. The resulting TheraDrive consists of an actuated hand crank with a compliant transmission. Actuation is provided by a brushed DC motor, geared to output up to 23 kgf at the end effector. To enable a human to interact with this system safely, a special compliant element was developed to double as a failsafe <b>torque</b> <b>limiter.</b> A set of strain gauges in the handle of the crank are used to determine the interaction forces between human and robot for use by the robot’s impedance controller.

As exercises are performed, an adaptive controller monitors patient performance and adjusts the force field accordingly. This allows the robot to compensate for gravity, variable mechanical advantage, limited range of motion, and other factors. More importantly, the adaptive controller ensures that exercises are difficult but doable, which is important for maintaining patient motivation.

30|$|The maximum {{recorded}} wire displacement with 884 and 1274  N of pretension was 2.76 and 2.99  mm, respectively. A {{previous study}} [20] measured {{the displacement of}} a single wire loaded perpendicular to its longitudinal axis at its mid-point, recording motion far higher than observed in this research. This is expected as the previous testing involved only one wire which was not fixed within a bone substitute. There is, to our knowledge, no previous study concerning measurement of wire deflection in a composite model. The maximum observed deflection was similar in the models tested with different levels of pretension though, interestingly, slightly higher in the 1274  N test by 0.28  mm. On examining the data further, this appeared {{to be due to}} an outlying measurement of 2.99  mm obtained in the 1274  N testing. We did not use a <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> to standardise bolt tightening, and as such this might have been inconsistent. We felt that this better mimicked the situation in clinical practice, but it may have led to this unexpected result if the bolts in this model were tightened less than in others. Another possibility is that at this tension plastic deformation of the wire begins to occur, increasing displacement. To investigate this, a further experiment was carried out by sequentially increasing the applied load to the wire of 1274  N pretension in 25  N increments to 800  N. No obvious change in the linear relationship between load and deformation was observed at higher loads, with the coefficient of determination reducing only slightly from 0.9995 to 0.9982. This change is so slight we cannot determine that the point of plastic deformation was reached. This agrees with results obtained in previous experimental testing. The confidence intervals obtained on repeated testing were very narrow, indicating the high precision of the measurement method used. At 884  N of pretension, the greatest margin of error was 0.19 at a deflection of 2.41  mm. At 1274  N, the greatest margin of error was 0.29 at the maximum deflection of 2.69  mm. All other measurements had margin of errors of less than 0.29  mm.|$|R
