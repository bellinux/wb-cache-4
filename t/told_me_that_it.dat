25|$|My friend, space lawyer Andrew G. Haley, {{who likes}} to explore {{historical}} questions as a hobby, later <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is likely that the}} Russians – and not the Germans as is popularly supposed – founded the first rocket society in the world. At least Moscow had an interplanetary travel group as early as 1924, and three years later, at the time the Germans founded their first rocket society, the Russians were hosts to the first International Exhibition of Space Navigation. In 1928 and during the following four years Professor Nikolai Rynin published a formidable nine-volume encyclopedia entitled Interplanetary Communications. It was the first authoritative summary of man’s knowledge of space travel.|$|E
500|$|... "Badlaa" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{inspired}} by stories of Indian fakirs. In fact, the episode's title means [...] "to retort" [...] or [...] "to revenge" [...] in Urdu. Further inspiration came [...] "from {{a little bit of}} desperation" [...] according to Shiban. He later recalled that he was walking through the Vancouver airport and suddenly had the thought, [...] "What if someone who {{came up to me and}} asked me for money was actually a bad guy." [...] Shiban later noted that his early drafts of the episode featured the antagonist with a different power. He explained, [...] "My original idea was a beggar with no legs who can actually shrink himself and climb inside your ear, and Chris Carter–and this is why he's Chris Carter–said 'No, no, no! I know what's even better.'" [...] Shiban later said that [...] "... one thing about this episode that I'm sort of proud is that people often have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is the most disgusting thought that they ever had, that this little man would actually enter your body and travel around inside you." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{her story}} {{progresses}} following her constant manipulative behavior, Chloe reveals her true identity: Kate Valentine, {{the daughter of}} the Chancellor maid Esther Valentine (Kate Linder). The storyline was dubbed [...] "Chloe is Kate". Hendrickson was pleased that the writers decided to give Chloe a backstory, saying, [...] "I was so excited when I found out Chloe was going to have some family ties. I knew it would give me, as an actor, a chance to finally explain to viewers why Chloe is the way she is." [...] The actress felt that her family reveal proved that she's not [...] "this bitch who likes to destroy people's lives", attesting her behavior to not being raised by parents; [...] "She never had anyone tell her wrong from right," [...] Hendrickson stated. Her backstory revealed that Chloe hadn't seen her mother or her employer Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) since she [...] "was young and overweight with braces". Kate Linder was also pleased with the writing direction, describing it as an [...] "honor" [...] to work with Hendrickson. She said, [...] "When they decided to bring [...] back, I was stunned and pleasantly surprised. Maria Bell called me and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was top secret. It was a great reveal." [...] Chloe initially gives Esther the cold shoulder. Of her reasoning behind this, Hendrickson said, [...] "Chloe is very young and immature — as well, hurt and ashamed about her upbringing. She’s not going to let her mother forget it easily." [...] She described their initial relationship as [...] "realistic" [...] and similar to [...] "a lot of mother-and-daughter relationships".|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think that}} you have made a good impression. He <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> before, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a matter for Sir Herbert Kitchener, and that he was expecting him in a quarter of an hour. Come and tell me the result, when you leave." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{signaled}} Clarkson for a low ball on {{one side}} and when it came it was high up on the other. It struck my hand as I tried to get it, and I would say it was a passed ball. You can give it to me if you want to. Clarkson <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> slipped from his hands." ...|$|E
2500|$|They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was going}} to be a trilogy. [...] What {{happened}} was that all of the people that made Streets of Fire left Universal Studios and went to 20th Century Fox. It was made at Universal, so they owned the rights to the story. [...] So it was left behind. I was told by Joel Silver that the sequel {{was going to}} be set in the snow, and the following film would be set in the desert.|$|E
2500|$|Ariel sighted the Bishop Light at 1:30 am on 5 September 1866. With all {{possible}} sail set, she sped toward {{the mouth of}} the English Channel. At daybreak, another ship was seen on the starboard quarter, also carrying every stitch of canvas that she could. Captain Keay of Ariel later said [...] "Instinct <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was the Taeping" [...] - and he was right. A strong west-southwesterly wind carried these two ships up the channel at 14 knots. The Lizard was abeam at 8:00 am and Start Point at noon. The two ships were off Portland towards 6:00 pm and St. Catherine's Point was due north at 7:25 pm. Beachy Head was abeam just after midnight. The relative positions of the two ships barely shifted all this while - Ariel kept her lead.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, your reverence; they're on the Ullathorne property. But a {{word from}} your reverence would do it. Mr. Henry thinks more of the foxes than anything. The last word he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> was <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would break his heart if he saw the coppices drawn blank." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} banned for release in Cambodia as the Cambodian Government {{does not allow}} films {{pertaining}} to the Khmer Rouge. This has become an issue among the film's fans: [...] " [...] I really want to watch the Red Sense. I have heard of {{it for a long}} time, and I have watched the trailer. It seems interesting. Some people <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it’s</b> not the same as other Khmer Rouge movies, filmed in the past."said a Khmer monk now living abroad, while a foreigner working in the Khmer film industry said, [...] "It’s a shame that Tim can’t get the film screened over here, but then this is the country where the Khmer Rouge period has been erased from school text books." ...|$|R
2500|$|After Jang's death, it was belatedly {{revealed}} {{that she had}} been secretly married. She had wed her husband, Kim Young-kyun, while in the U.S. for cancer treatment, and registered the marriage to make it official in Korea just days before her death. Kim later published a book commemorating the 608 days of their relationship, called My Last Gift To Her. The book features previously unreleased photos (including that of their Las Vegas wedding), {{as well as some of}} the letters and text messages they'd exchanged. When asked in an interview why he wrote the book, Kim answered: [...] "Right now, my memories of Jin-young are distinct, but I'm human and someday my memories will grow dimmer. I don't want to lose my memories of being with her. Writing this was my way to deal with that. Someone who writes for a living <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> helps and is a good method for organizing their emotions, and those words motivated me to write the book. Also, as I've already said in the prologue, Jin-young was an actress who had a great future ahead of her, and I thought it would help in having her remembered beautifully. Even when her time was limited, she didn't give up hope and lived diligently, and I wanted to let people know of Jin-young's passionate life." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the World Cup {{finals in}} June 2010, Argentina started by winning 1–0 against Nigeria, {{followed}} by a 4–1 victory over South Korea {{on the strength of}} a Gonzalo Higuaín hat-trick. In the final match of the group stage, Argentina won 2–0 against Greece to win the group and advance to a second round, meeting Mexico. After defeating Mexico 3–1, however, Argentina was routed by Germany 4–0 in the quarter-finals to go out of the competition. Argentina was ranked fifth in the tournament. After the defeat to Germany, Maradona admitted that he was considering his future as Argentina coach, stating, [...] "I may leave tomorrow." [...] On 15 July 2010, the AFA said that he would be offered a new four-year deal that would keep him in charge through to the summer of 2014 when Brazil stages the World Cup. On 27 July, however, the AFA announced that its board had unanimously decided not to renew his contract. Afterwards, on 29 July, Maradona claimed that AFA president Julio Grondona and director of national teams (as well as his former Argentine national team and Sevilla coach) Carlos Bilardo had [...] "lied to", [...] "betrayed" [...] and effectively sacked him from the role. He said, [...] "They wanted me to continue, but seven of my staff should not go on, if he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> meant he did not want me to keep working." ...|$|E

5000|$|M. A. Thomas, {{founder of}} the Ecumenical Christian Centre (Bangalore), {{recalled}} organizing an inter-religious conference for students in 1936. Father Palocaren [...] "encouraged {{students to participate in}} the conference even though he had some misapprehension about the prospects of an Inter-religious conference. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> though <b>it</b> was not pure milk, some milk with water {{would be good for the}} students." ...|$|R
5000|$|Carr is a twin to her sister, Megan. After {{her father}} remarried, he and Carr's step-mother {{had a little}} girl, Maddie. Carr's father {{supported}} her through her career until his sudden death in 2015. She {{said he was the}} person she would talk to about all her big events and that his death was hard on her. In an interview with The University of Wisconsin - Madison she said [...] "The best piece of advice he ever gave me was about listening. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> not my job to talk first — it's about taking in information. He said a really great way to start off dialogue with someone is to thank them for taking time out of their job for me to do mine — being humble, being appreciative and coming from a place of goodness".|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Christian, {{touching}} the open Bible, [...] "God's book has <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> It has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> more than <b>that.</b> <b>It</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> there is forgiveness for {{the chief of}} sinners." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is called}} Tozie, ma'am, not cozie," [...] {{continued}} the traveller; [...] "the Shroffs at Surat <b>told</b> <b>me</b> in 1801, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is made out}} of the inner coat of a goat." ...|$|R

5000|$|Matin stated: [...] "When I {{finished}} the actual song, I found the word stromata first of all. I'd been researching intelligent science, {{space and time}} travel, the eleven dimensions of God and all this crazy stuff. I'm a very spiritual person and upon my readings I came across the word stromata and I really loved what it represented and what it stood for. It means it's {{the framework of a}} cell. There's many definitions. Someone <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> a spiritual or religious term. I was looking at it as a scientific term but I used basically a metaphoric explanation as to why everything connects and disconnects and why basically in the last year my life has fallen apart and got put back together. And the words in the song seemed to encapsulate and sum up everything that I was feeling and what I thought was happening in the world. There were just more than terrible things happening that I don't understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it's very {{inconsistent}} of you {{to oppose}} the matter now, when you've shown so much indifference up to this time. You've <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> all along, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was of no use to oppose it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it's hard, sir, but it's better so. I've {{reckoned}} mebbe she was {{a little}} crazy, and since you've <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Spanish yarn, <b>it</b> mout be <b>that</b> she was sort o' playin' she was that priest, and trained that mustang ez she did." ...|$|R
