5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} sound for communication, a wide range of insects have evolved chemical means for communication. These chemicals, termed semiochemicals, are often derived from plant metabolites include those meant to attract, repel and provide other kinds of information. Pheromones, a type of semiochemical, are used for attracting mates of the opposite sex, for aggregating conspecific individuals of both sexes, for deterring other individuals from approaching, to mark a trail, and to trigger aggression in nearby individuals. Allomonea benefit their producer by the effect they have upon <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> Kairomones benefit their receiver instead of their producer. Synomones benefit the producer and <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> While some chemicals are targeted at individuals of the same species, others are used for communication across species. The use of scents is especially well known to have developed in social insects.|$|E
5|$|The RAE's {{comments}} about the self-exciting transmitter were not random: they were referring to work that was just coming to fruition at EMI {{as a direct result}} of Lewis' earlier contract. EMI engineers Alan Blumlein and Eric White had developed a system that dispensed with a self-exciting transmitter circuit and instead used a separate modulator that fed the signal into the transmitter for amplification. The oscillator signal was also sent to <b>the</b> <b>receiver,</b> using it to damp its sensitivity. The combined effect was to sharpen the transmitted pulse, while reducing 'ringing' in <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> In a test in May 1940, Hanbury Brown was able to clearly see the return at a range of , and could still make it out when they approached to 400.|$|E

40|$|The {{capacity}} of the semideterministic discrete memoryless broadcast channel (SD-BC) with partial message side-information (P-MSI) at <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> is established. In the setting without a common message, it is shown that P-MSI to <b>the</b> stochastic <b>receiver</b> alone can increase capacity, whereas P-MSI to <b>the</b> deterministic <b>receiver</b> can only increase capacity if also <b>the</b> stochastic <b>receiver</b> has P-MSI. <b>The</b> latter holds only for the setting without a common message: if the encoder also conveys a common message, then P-MSI to <b>the</b> deterministic <b>receiver</b> alone can increase capacity. These capacity results are used to show that feedback from <b>the</b> stochastic <b>receiver</b> can increase <b>the</b> {{capacity of}} the SD-BC without P-MSI and the sum-rate {{capacity of the}} SD-BC with P-MSI at <b>the</b> deterministic <b>receiver.</b> <b>The</b> link between P-MSI and feedback is a feedback code, which [...] -roughly speaking [...] -turns feedback into P-MSI at <b>the</b> stochastic <b>receiver</b> and hence helps <b>the</b> stochastic <b>receiver</b> mitigate experienced interference.

A receiver who has one (score of 30–40 or advantage), two (score of 15–40) or three (score of love-40) consecutive chances to win the game has break point, double break point or triple break point, respectively. If <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> does, in fact, win their break point, the game is awarded to <b>the</b> <b>receiver,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> is said to have converted their break point. If <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> fails to win their break point it is called a failure to convert. Winning break points, and thus the game, is also referred to as breaking serve, as <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> has disrupted, or broken the natural advantage of the server. If in the following game the previous server also wins a break point it is referred to as breaking back. Except where tie-breaks apply, at least one break of serve is required to win a set.|$|E
