40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to improve our {{understanding}} of the properties of the free energy barriers in protein folding. We used the small all-[beta]-sheet protein <b>tendamistat</b> as a model protein. <b>Tendamistat</b> contains two disulfide bridges and folds and unfolds in apparent two-state reactions. However, previous studies on disulfide variants demonstrated that <b>tendamistat</b> folds in at least two sequential steps with a high-energy intermediate. Elucidation of the properties of the free energy barriers by studying different <b>tendamistat</b> variants and various fragments provide a good insight into the underlying complexity of apparent two state folders. To obtain this information several approaches have been used in this work: we studied the combined influence of denaturant, temperature, structural variation and sodium sulfate on folding and stability; furthermore, we analysed the properties and stability of different fragments of <b>tendamistat.</b> Multiple perturbation analysis was used to gain information on the shape of the free energy barriers in <b>tendamistat</b> folding. Analysis of denaturant and temperature as perturbations revealed transition state movement according to the Hammond postulate. Hammond behaviour is more pronounced in the early transition state compared to the late transition state where only small transition state movement was observed. The results suggest that the early transition state is rather broad compared to the late transition state. These results emphasized the importance of multiple perturbation analysis to test the shape of the free energy barriers in protein folding. Determination of the activation parameters revealed less difference between both transition states. However, the denaturant dependence of the activation parameters of the transition states differs significantly. The results confirm our previous suggestion that the early transition state is broad and structurally less well defined, whereas the late transition state shows a rather narrow and structurally well-defined maximum.

40|$|International audienceThe {{increasing}} interest in click chemistry {{and its use}} to stabilize turn structures led us to compare the propensity for β-turn stabilization of different analogs designed as mimics of the β-turn structure found in <b>tendamistat.</b> The β-turn conformation of linear β-amino acid-containing peptides and triazole-cyclized analogs were compared to 'conventional' lactam- and disulfide-bridged hexapeptide analogs. Their 3 D structures and their propensity to fold in β-turns in solution, and for those not structured in solution {{in the presence of}} α-amylase, were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy and by restrained molecular dynamics with energy minimization. The linear tetrapeptide Ac-Ser-Trp-Arg-Tyr-NH(2) and both the amide bond-cyclized, c[Pro-Ser-Trp-Arg-Tyr-D-Ala] and the disulfide-bridged, Ac-c[Cys-Ser-Trp-Arg-Tyr-Cys]-NH(2) hexapeptides adopt dominantly in solution a β-turn conformation closely related to the one observed in <b>tendamistat.</b> On the contrary, the β-amino acid-containing peptides such as Ac-(R) -β(3) -hSer-(S) -Trp-(S) -β(3) -hArg-(S) -β(3) -hTyr-NH(2), and the triazole cyclic peptide, c[Lys-Ser-Trp-Arg-Tyr-βtA]-NH(2), both specifically designed to mimic this β-turn, do not adopt stable structures in solution and do not show any characteristics of β-turn conformation. However, these unstructured peptides specifically interact in the active site of α-amylase, as shown by TrNOESY and saturation transfer difference NMR experiments performed {{in the presence of the}} enzyme, and are displaced by acarbose, a specific α-amylase inhibitor. Thus, in contrast to amide-cyclized or disulfide-bridged hexapeptides, β-amino acid-containing peptides and click-cyclized peptides may not be regarded as β-turn stabilizers, but can be considered as potential β-turn inducers.

GdmCl-induced equilibrium unfolding transitions reveal that {{the volume of the}} native state is increased by 41. 4 ± 2. 0 cm 3 /mol relative to the unfolded state. This value is virtually independent of denaturant concentration. The use of a high-pressure stopped-flow instrument enabled us to measure the activation volumes for the refolding (ΔVf 0 ‡) and unfolding reaction (ΔVu 0 ‡) over a broad range of GdmCl concentrations. The volume of the transition state is 60 % native-like (ΔVf 0 ‡ = 25. 0 ± 1. 2 cm 3 /mol) in the absence of denaturant, indicating partial solvent accessibility of the core residues. The volume of the transition state increases linearly with denaturant concentration and exceeds the volume of the native state above 6 M GdmCl.

40|$|AbstractThe β-hairpin fold {{mechanism}} of a nine-residue peptide, which is modified from the β-hairpin of α-amylase inhibitor <b>tendamistat</b> (residues 15 – 23), is studied through direct folding simulations in explicit water at native folding conditions. Three 300 -nanosecond self-guided molecular dynamics (SGMD) simulations have revealed {{a series of}} β-hairpin folding events. During these simulations, the peptide folds repeatedly into a major cluster of β-hairpin structures, which agree well with nuclear magnetic resonance experimental observations. This major cluster is found to have the minimum conformational free energy among all sampled conformations. This peptide also folds into many other β-hairpin structures, which represent some local free energy minimum states. In the unfolded state, the N-terminal residues of the peptide, Tyr- 1, Gln- 2, and Asn- 3, have a confined conformational distribution. This confinement makes β-hairpin the only energetically favored structure to fold. The unfolded state of this peptide is populated with conformations with non-native intrapeptide interactions. This peptide goes through fully hydrated conformations to eliminate non-native interactions before folding into a β-hairpin. The folding of a β-hairpin starts with side-chain interactions, which bring two strands together to form interstrand hydrogen bonds. The unfolding of the β-hairpin is not simply the reverse of the folding process. Comparing unfolding simulations using MD and SGMD methods demonstrate that SGMD simulations can qualitatively reproduce the kinetics of the peptide system...|$|E

For Streptomyces lividans, four different type I SPases (denoted SipW, SipX, SipY, and SipZ) were previously described. In this communication, we report the experimental determination of the membrane topology of these SPases. A protease protection assay of SPase <b>tendamistat</b> fusions confirmed the presence of the N- as well as the C-terminal transmembrane anchor for SipY. SipX and SipZ have a predicted topology similar to that of SipY. These three S. lividans SPases are currently the only known prokaryotic-type type I SPases of gram-positive bacteria with a C-terminal transmembrane anchor, thereby establishing a new subclass of type I SPases. In contrast, S. lividans SipW contains only the N-terminal transmembrane segment, similar to most type I SPases of gram-positive bacteria. Functional analysis showed that the C-terminal transmembrane anchor of SipY is important to enhance the processing activity, both in vitro as well as in vivo. Moreover, for the S. lividans SPases, a relation seems to exist between {{the presence or absence of}} the C-terminal anchor and the relative contributions to the total SPase processing activity in the cell.

A dimensionless measure, Ωc, is introduced to quantitatively assess the degree of cooperativity in lattice models and in real proteins. We show that larger values of Ωc resembling the values seen in proteins are obtained in lattice models with sidechains. The enhanced cooperativity of such models results from possible denser packing of sidechains in the interior of the model polypeptide chain. We also establish that Ωc correlates extremely well with σT = (Tθ –  Tf) /Tθ, where Tθ and Tf are collapse and folding transition temperatures, respectively.

The α-amylase inhibitor (α-AI) from the bean Phaseolus vulgaris belongs to a family of plant defence proteins and is a potent inhibitor of mammalian α-amylases. The structure of pig pancreatic α-amylase (PPA) in complex with both a carbohydrate inhibitor (acarbose) and a proteinaceous inhibitor (<b>Tendamistat)</b> is known, but the catalytic mechanism is poorly understood. Results The crystal structure of pig pancreatic α-amylase complexed with α-AI was refined to 1. 85 å resolution. It reveals that in complex with PPA, the inhibitor has the typical dimer structure common to legume lectins. Two hairpin loops extending out from the jellyroll fold of a monomer interact directly with the active site region of the enzyme molecule, with the inhibitor molecule filling the whole substrate-docking region of the PPA. The inhibitor makes substrate-mimetic interactions with binding subsites of the enzyme and targets catalytic residues in the active site. Binding of inhibitor induces structural changes at the active site of the enzyme. Conclusions The present analysis reveals that there are extensive interactions between the inhibitor and residues that are highly conserved in the active site of α-amylases; α-AI 1 inactivates PPA through elaborate blockage of substrate-binding sites.

40|$|Biomimetic {{peptides}} are autonomously folding secondary structural units {{designed to}} serve as models for examining processes that occur in proteins. Although de novo biomimetic peptides are not simply abbreviated versions of proteins already found in nature, designing biomimetic peptides does require {{an understanding of how}} native proteins are formed and stabilized. The discovery of autonomously folding fragments of ribonuclease A and <b>tendamistat</b> pioneered the use of biomimetic peptides for determining how the polypeptide sequence stabilizes formation of alpha helices and beta hairpins in aqueous and organic solutions. A set of rules for constructing stable alpha helices have now been established. There is no exact set of rules for designing beta hairpins; however, some factors that must be considered are the identity of the residues in the turn and non-covalent interactions between amino acid side chains. For example, glycine, proline, aspargine, and aspartic acid are favored in turns. Non-covalent interactions that stabilize hairpin formation include salt bridges, pi-stacked aromatic interactions, cation-pi interactions, and hydrophobic interactions. The optimal strand length for beta hairpins depends on the numbers of stabilizing non-covalent interactions and high hairpin propensity amino acids in the specific peptide being designed. Until now, de novo hairpins have not previously been used to examine biological processes aside from protein folding. This thesis uses de novo designed biomimetic peptides as tractable models to examine how non-covalent interactions control the redox properties of tyrosine in enzymes. The data in this study demonstrate that proton transfer to histidine, a hydrogen bond to arginine, and a pi-cation interaction create a peptide environment that lowers the midpoint potential of tyrosine in beta hairpins. Moreover, these interactions contribute equally to control the midpoint potential. The data also show that hydrogen bonding is not the sole determinant of the midpoint potential of tyrosine. Finally, the data suggest that the Tyr 160 D 2 -Arg 272 CP 47 pi-cation interaction contributes to the differences in redox properties between Tyr 160 and Tyr 161 of photosystem II. Ph. D.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Nowadays {{structural}} biology represents an advanced frontier {{for a detailed}} understanding of life processes. Several projects of structural genomics are presented world-wide, since predictable or experimentally derived structures, mostly of proteins, represent a solid basis for engineering new therapeutic or diagnostic tools. However, some missing details still exist as the biological functions result to be not simply correlated to protein shapes and flexibility. The presence of “hot spots” on the molecular surface, always including the protein active sites (1, 2), and the anomalous activity of some non-competitive enzyme inhibitors (3) suggest that around the protein surface a non-uniform motion of solvent and other molecules occurs. NMR seems {{to be perfectly suited}} to investigate on this new dimension of {{structural biology}}, since two techniques, i. e. water-protein Overhauser (4) effects and paramagnetic perturbation profiles (5), independently or in a combined way can be used to probe the accessibility of the protein surface towards molecules with different polarity. The results obtained from both NMR methods for a series of small proteins such as BPTI, <b>tendamistat</b> and single chain monellin (5, 6) suggest that {{only a limited number of}} water molecules reside at the protein surface for a time long enough to yield sizeable intermolecular NOEs. The active sites of these proteins never have such tightly bound water molecules nearby. Accordingly, TEMPOL, a stable uncharged nitroxide, efficiently approaches the latter protein moieties due to the reduced hindrance from solvent molecules. Furthermore, there are protein regions where bound water molecules, organised in strong hydration sites, prevent the access of the nitroxide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 13 C- 1 H HSQC, 1 D and 2 D ePHOGSY spectra of 5 mM HEW lysozyme were acquired at 308 K and pH 3. 8, using a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer equipped with a Silicon Graphics Indy workstation.

The enzyme inhibitor (NAG) 3 was 7. 5 mM to ensure full complexation of lysozyme. RESULTS: Paramagnetic attenuation profiles and water-protein nuclear Overhaser effects observed for HEW lysozyme, obtained in the presence and in the absence of the competitive inhibitor (NAG) 3, were analysed in terms of accessibility of water and TEMPOL molecules towards the protein surface. The combined use of ePHOGSY spectroscopy and TEMPOL induced perturbations resulted to be very powerful also to find, as in the previously reported case for BPTI (5), the internal water molecules...|$|E
