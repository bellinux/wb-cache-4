40|$|Abstract Background The {{detection}} of T-wave end points on electrocardiogram (ECG) {{is a basic}} procedure for ECG processing and analysis. Several methods have been proposed and tested, featuring high accuracy and percentages of correct detection. Nevertheless, their performance in noisy conditions remains an open problem. Methods A new approach and algorithm for T-wave end location based on the computation of <b>Trapezium's</b> areas is proposed and validated (in terms of accuracy and repeatability), using signals from the Physionet QT Database. The performance of the proposed algorithm in noisy conditions has been tested and compared {{with one of the}} most used approaches for estimating the T-wave end point: the method based on the threshold on the first derivative. Results The results indicated that the proposed approach based on <b>Trapezium's</b> areas outperformed the baseline method with respect to accuracy and repeatability. Also, the proposed method is more robust to wideband noise. Conclusions The trapezium-based approach has a good performance in noisy conditions and does not rely on any empirical threshold. It is very adequate for use in scenarios where the levels of broadband noise are significant. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{three main}} {{requirements}} of a vehicle-trailer connection system are: en route stability, over- or under-steering restraint, minimum off-tracking along curved path. Linking the two units by four-bar <b>trapeziums,</b> wider stability margins may be attained {{in comparison with the}} conventional pintle-hitch for both instability types, divergent or oscillating. The stability maps are traced applying the Hurwitz method or the direct analysis of the characteristic equation at the instability threshold. Several types of four-bar linkages may be quickly tested, with the drawbars converging towards the trailer or the towing unit. The latter configuration appears preferable in terms of self-stability and may yield high critical speeds by optimising the geometrical and physical properties. Nevertheless, the system stability may be improved in general by additional vibration dampers in parallel with the connection linkage. Moreover, the four-bar connection may produce significant corrections of the under-steering or over-steering behaviour of the vehicle-train after a steering command from the driver. The offtracking along the curved paths may be also optimized or kept inside prefixed margins of acceptableness. Activating electronic stability systems if necessary, fair results are obtainable for both the steering conduct and the off-tracking...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{comparative study of}} modelling and segmentation of P and T waves in electrocardiograms, using three different mathematical models: Gaussian function, a composition of two Gaussian functions and Rayleigh probability density function (Rayleigh pdf). In order to evaluate the adaptability and the matching degree between each model and each characteristic wave, we compute the normalized root mean square (RMS) error, {{as well as the}} evolution of the fitting parameters related to each kernel throughout ECG records from the well-known QT database. Concerning the delineation of P and T-waves, we apply Wavelet Transform for estimating T-wave and P-wave peak locations and combine each developed model with an approach based on the computation of <b>Trapezium's</b> area to locate the end point of each T-wave and the beginning and end point of each P-wave. The composition of two Gaussian functions has produced the most accurate results concerning wave modelling, providing average values of normalized RMS errors equal to 9, 15 % and 18, 70 %, respectively for T-wave and P-wave. Rayleigh pdf provided the most stable fitting parameters. For T-wave end location, the most accurate results were computed when using the kernel composition of two Gaussian functions, for which the average time error was 4, 49 ± 14, 32 ms. For P-wave begin and P-wave end locations, the most accurate results were computed when using kernel Rayleigh pdf, for which the average time errors were, respectively, - 4, 23 ± 14, 84 ms and 2, 26 ± 13, 14 ms.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative approach for T-wave peak detection and subsequent T-wave end location in 12 -lead paced ECG signals {{based on a}} mathematical model of a skewed Gaussian function. Following the stage of QRS segmentation, we establish search windows using {{a number of the}} earliest intervals between each QRS offset and subsequent QRS onset. Then, we compute a template based on a Gaussian-function, modified by a mathematical procedure to insert asymmetry, which models the T-wave. Cross-correlation and an approach based on the computation of <b>Trapezium's</b> area are used to locate, respectively, the peak and end point of each T-wave throughout the whole raw ECG signal. For evaluating purposes, we used a database of high resolution 12 -lead paced ECG signals, recorded from patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) in the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, UK, and the well-known QT database. The average T-wave detection rates, sensitivity and positive predictivity, were both equal to 99. 12 %, for the first database, and, respectively, equal to 99. 32 % and 99. 47 %, for QT database. The average time errors computed for T-wave peak and T-wave end locations were, respectively, − 0. 38 ± 7. 12 ms and − 3. 70 ± 15. 46 ms, for the first database, and 1. 40 ± 8. 99 ms and 2. 83 ± 15. 27 ms, for QT database.

40|$|The present {{analysis}} is addressed to some promising connection arrangements between the towing vehicles and the towed trailers, {{where the two}} units are linked by four-bar isosceles <b>trapeziums</b> {{in place of the}} conventional pintle hitch. Two types of instability, of the divergent type or the oscillating type, may be analysed by the Routh–Hurwitz criterion or by the direct analysis of the characteristic equation. The constant term of this equation vanishes at the divergent instability threshold (zero of a real root), whereas the equation splits into two lower degree algebraic ‘sub-equations’ when the oscillating instability arises (pair of pure imaginary roots). A large field of geometrical configurations of the four-bar linkage may be quickly tested by numerical search procedures, including those where the sidebars of the linkage converge towards the inside of the drawing car and shift the relative centre of rotation forward, and those converging backward towards the trailer. Maps of the critical velocity {{as a function of the}} geometrical or physical parameters may be easily traced. They clearly show the favourable influence of the forward four-bar connection in general and the benefits achievable comparing with the conventional coupling. Actually, it is conceivable to increase the critical speed by optimising the four-bar design depending on the weight distribution on the axles and on the other geometrical and physical properties. Moreover, this type of connection may produce significant corrections to the under-steering or over-steering conduct of the articulated vehicle. The off-tracking and the manoeuvrability along curved paths are also studied, showing the benefits or the drawbacks of the four-bar linkage for the various configurations...|$|R
25|$|The {{share is}} {{the cutting edge}} of the {{moldboard}} plow. The share makes the horizontal cut that separates the furrow slice from the soil below and when it is worn it is important to fit a new one. Conventional shares have points that are shaped. This shape, which was developed through years of field experience, penetrates ordinary soil efficiently and stands rough use. The share is shaped so that it pulls itself into the ground. As the share wears away, it becomes blunt and the plough will require more power to pull it through the soil. A plough body with a worn share will not have enough 'suck' to ensure that it penetrates the ground to its full working depth. The tip of the share is pointed downward, causing the plow to run into the ground. This is called “suction or down suck”; it literally sucks the plow into the ground, to a regulated depth. The clearance, also usually referred to as “suction or down suck”, varies with different makes and types of plows (the related clearance at the side is called “land suck”). Its configuration is related to soil type, particularly in the down suction, or concavity, of its lower surface. Generally, three degrees of clearance or down suction are recognized: regular for light soil, deep for ordinary dry soil, and double-deep for clay and gravelly soils. In addition, the share has horizontal suction, which is related to the amount its point is bent out of line with the landside. Down suction causes the plow to penetrate to proper depth when pulled forward, while horizontal suction causes the plow to create the desired width of furrow. The share is a plane part with trapezoidal shape. It cuts the soil horizontally and lifts it. Common types are regular, winged-plane, bar-point, and share with mounted or welded point. The regular share conserves a good cut but is recommended on stone-free soils. The winged-plane share is used on heavy soil with a moderate amount of stones. The bar-point share can be used in extreme conditions (hard and stony soils). The use of the share with mounted point is somewhere between the last two types. Manufacturers have designed shares of various shapes (<b>trapezium,</b> diamond, etc.) with bolted point and wings, often separately renewable. Sometimes the share cutting edge is placed well in advance of the moldboard to reduce the pulverizing action of the soil.|$|E

40|$|Intelligent and {{automated}} production {{have become}} an inevitable trend for manufacturing companies in developed countries. Robotic welding is a key component in order to ac- complish a competitive and effective production. Successful implementation of robotic welding is especially seen throughout the automobile industry. However, other industries {{are still on the}} verge of utilizing robotic welding. One of them is the offshore sector. Offshore structures are large constructions welded together by minor components. An ex- ample of this is ships, assembled by thick plates welded together end-to-end. To ensure sufficient strength in the welded joints, full penetration welds are needed and a multiple-pass weld sequence is required. Multiple-pass welding is generally done manually as the process is complex and difficult to automate. This thesis presents an automated solution for multiple-pass welding of thick V-groove butt joints with variable geometry. This welding configuration is common in shipbuilding and in fabrication of high pressure vessels. Previous research on automated multiple-pass planning have been reviewed and used as a basis for the solution presented in this thesis. A procedure that determines a welding sequence containing the number of layers and passes based on geometrical properties of a butt joint, is created using different programming and simulation software. Weld beads are approximated as sets of parallelograms and <b>trapeziums.</b> Algorithms in this procedure calculates the position and pose of the welding torch, amplitude of weaving and the number of passes for each layer based on a set of parameters and criteria. These are welding speed, filler wire feed speed, maximum amplitude of weaving and maximum allowed bead height. A robot program is then created for execution of the welding sequence. The procedure have been implemented in the robotics laboratory at the Institute of Production and Quality Engineering, NTNU. This implementation showed the effective- ness of the automated procedure by successfully welding different V-groove butt joints. A set of preliminary tests were conducted to determine viable combinations of welding parameters. Continuous testing was then carried out to adjust the deposition efficiency coefficient and the weaving factor. In the end, conformity between the procedure and the experimental results was obtained. The results from all welding experiments are presented in the thesis...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Mathematics) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2012 There {{are several}} factors in our {{environment}} such as cultural artefacts, murals, our tradition, buildings and language {{that can be}} used to teach mathematics in context or used as examples to the learners but which we are unaware of or which we do not consider as appropriate. People interact with the world and attempt to comprehend, interpret, and explain it using numbers, logic and spatial configuration which are culturally shaped. These are the ways in which we produce mathematical knowledge. This has helped to stimulate other mathematicians on the African continent to Africanise mathematics teaching. Mathematics is viewed as a human activity as all people of the world practice some form of mathematics. In teaching mathematics meaningfully and relevantly, the teacher, the learner, their experiences, and their cultural backgrounds become extremely important factors to create conducive learning environments. This study was set out to explore the mathematical concepts of the traditional buildings of the Limpopo Province, South Africa and the teaching of high school mathematics. The rationale for the study was to explore the extent to which mathematical shapes or concepts of the traditional buildings of the Limpopo Province could be used to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics in context. The research questions that guided the exploration were: 1. Which ma 1 thematical concepts embedded in the traditional buildings of the Limpopo Province can be used to teach high school mathematics? 2. What challenges do high school mathematics educators face in contextualising their teaching? 3. Which suggestions can be made to assist mathema 1 tics educators to contextualise their teaching? The population for the study was made up of the builders of the circular houses from the Vhembe (Tshivenda), Mopani (Xitsonga) and Sekhukhune (Sepedi) people of the Limpopo Province and Grade 12 mathematics teachers of the Limpopo Province. The total population was 255, (68 circular houses builders and 187 Gradle 12 mathematics teachers.) The three districts were chosen because they are classified as iargely rural as compared to other districts in the Limpopo Province. They also have many indigenous buildings which were used to collect data for this study. The data were gathered through observations, interviews with the builders and questionnaire 1 for the educators. For analysis, descriptive statistical analysis, narrative, and inductive analysis were used to analyse the da 1 ta. Although the builders who participated in this study could not explain using the mathematical language how they constructed the buildings, various mathematical concepts and symbols such as triangles, squares, parallelog 1 rams, kites, circles, rhombi, rectangles, <b>trapeziums,</b> translations, reflections, rotations, similarities, congruency, tessellations were discovered. These mathematical concepts can be used by both Educators and learners to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics. Further evidence emerged that teaching mathematics with meaning and relating it to the real world makes mathematics more relevant and meaningful. It was suggested that teacher training courses and programmes should include also courses on culture, society, the relationship between mathematics and culture, and the history of evolution of mathematical concepts. Contextualised learning activities shoulcd be designed to encourage learning mathematics concepts for understanding. In-service courses at Colleges of Education and Universities should include the application of ethnomathematics and indigenous knowledge systems in their teacher training programmes. Doctora...|$|R
