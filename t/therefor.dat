Speeches, debates, and votes cast in the Diet also enjoy parliamentary privileges. Each house is responsible for disciplining its own members, and all deliberations are public unless two-thirds or more of those members present passes a resolution agreeing it otherwise. The Diet also requires the presence of at least one-third of the membership of either house in order to constitute a quorum. All decisions are decided by a majority of those present, unless otherwise stated by the Constitution, {{and in the case of}} a tie, the presiding officer has the right to decide the issue. A member cannot be expelled, however, unless a majority of two-thirds or more of those members present passes a resolution <b>therefor.</b>|$|E

25|$|Local {{leaders were}} {{willing to accept the}} new waste-storage, but in the mean time they were reluctant, because the anger of some of their {{citizens}} {{and the fact that the}} presence of it, could hamper all efforts to decontaminate the area and would make repopulation impossible. <b>Therefor</b> they requested an insurance from the government, that the storage would be closed after 30 years.|$|E

25|$|Locally {{decreasing}} fuel tax can decrease fuel prices, but globally {{prices are}} set by supply and demand, and therefore fuel tax decreases {{may have no}} effect on fuel prices, and fuel tax increases might actually decrease fuel prices by reducing demand. But this depends on the price elasticity of demand for fuel which is -0.09 to -0.31, meaning that fuel is a relatively inelastic commodity, i.e. increasing or decreasing prices have overall only a small effect on demand and <b>therefor</b> price change.|$|E

25|$|After {{the death}} of the {{eleventh}} Imam in 873, and the mysterious fate of the son of Hasan al-Askari shia was divided into a number of factions, some asserted that his son had died at his early age; others, that he had lived but died in old age; still others denied his existence completely. Another group took up the ideas of the Wāqefīya. Another argued that, as a childless Imam cannot die and leave the world without imam, Imam Hasan al-Askari, <b>therefor,</b> had not died but had gone into occultation.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} sources emphasized on the Sasanians' {{hatred of}} everything {{adapted from the}} Parthians. The existence of such a mentality in Ardashir is understandable; but even {{he was forced to}} establish his newborn government on Parthian foundations by the help of other remarkable Iranian houses, who were either affiliated with the Parthians or nursed by them. However, no change is seen in that hatred of the Parthians in the next generations of Sasanian emperors either. <b>Therefor,</b> it can be deduced that the Parthians enforced a more hard and tyrannical domination than presumed on their submitted shahs and {{that might have been the}} reason that facilitated Ardashir's conquest.|$|E
25|$|Briefly, {{through his}} two theories, the Simple Control Theory and Initial Control Theory, Wilson {{is able to}} contrast, and <b>therefor</b> better define, the usage of the possessive particles, a and o. The Simple Control Theory speculates that the {{determining}} factor directly correlated to the possessor’s control over the object; emphasizing a dominant vs. less-dominant relationship. Old Rapa adheres closer to the latter of Wilson’s two theories, the Initial Control Theory. This theory speculates that “the possessor’s control over the initiation of the possessive relationship is the determining factor.” Here, his Initial Control Theory can also be generally expanded to the whole Polynesian language family in terms of better describing the “alienability” of possession.|$|E
25|$|Based on a {{research}} by Callieri, {{most of the}} symbols of the Frataraka's coins like the flag, the memorial building and the appearing posture of the person standing opposite to it are derived from the Achaemenids. Daryaee believes that though the Fratarakas probably {{did not know the}} proper application of a building like Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, it still had an ideological importance to them. <b>Therefor,</b> it can be deduced from the similarity of Ardashir's coins with the late coins of local Persian governors there was a movement based on Persian traditions and the local Persian governors' adornment of it. However that {{does not necessarily mean that}} Ardashir was related to the local Persian shahs in all affairs.|$|E
25|$|On 12 November 1970, the {{municipal}} council voted {{to establish a}} limited company to finance the bridge. Askøybrua AS was founded with a share capital of NOK775,000 and owned by {{the municipal}}ities of Askøy, Laksevåg, Åsane, Fjell, Sund and Øygarden, Hordaland County Municipality and Rutelaget Askøy–Bergen—the latter who operated all the islands bus routes and the ferry. During the council meeting, representatives for the municipal administration commented that 85 {{percent of the people}} from Askøy who worked outside the municipality worked in the city center of Bergen; they were transported quickly with ferries which were not hampered by congestion. Should a bridge be built, it would only be able to be financed if people traveled using the bridge, and <b>therefor</b> terminating the ferry, even though it provided a superior service, was proposed.|$|E
25|$|Hamar Station {{received}} an upgrade {{ahead of the}} 1994 Winter Olympics, for which Hamar was a host city. The original station building was little suited for modern use and the outdoor areas served transfer to bus, car and taxis poorly. NSB <b>therefor</b> decided to demolish the cargo and electric buildings {{to make room for}} a new bus terminal. The remaining part of the station, including the restaurant building, were renovated to as close to the original plans and interior as feasible, largely undoing the work of the 1970s. The work involved building an underpass and an overpass to tracks 2 and 3. The project was funded as a joint project between NSB, Hamar Municipality, Hedmark County Municipality and the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. Manned ticket sales by NSB were terminated on 19 January 2002 and taken over by Narvesen.|$|E
25|$|About {{the year}} of Shapur's {{participation}} in reign with Ardashir, it has been written in Cologne Mani-Codex in Greek about Mani's life:When I became twenty-four years old; in the year that Persian king, Dari-Ardashir opened the city Hatra, and in the year Shapur Shah, his son, put the largest crown in the month Famuthi, on the month day (8th day of Farmuthi), my god, who is the most blessed, made me proud by his generosity, summoned me by his favor...It can be deduced by calculating the Egyptian month and year that Shapur's coronation as his father's royal partner occurred on April 12, 240 (the {{first day of the}} Babylonian month Nisan in the year 551). Ardashir and Shapur's simultaneous reign lasted apparently until early 242. <b>Therefor,</b> {{it can be said that}} Shapur was probably crowned twice; once as a royal partner in 240 and later in 243 as lonely reign; however it is more probable that he was crowned only once in 240.|$|E

This followed by the Army Act No. 17 of 1949 which was passed by Parliament on April 11, 1949 and formalised in Gazette Extraordinary No. 10028 of October 10, 1949 marked {{the creation of the}} Ceylon Army, consisting of a regular and a volunteer force, the later being the successor of the disbanded CDF. <b>Therefor</b> October 10, 1949 is considered the Ceylon Army was raised, and October 10 is celebrated annually as Army day. The Defence Agreement of 1947 provided the assurance that British would {{come to the aid of}} Ceylon in the event it was attacked by a foreign power and provided British military advisers to build up the country's military. Brigadier James Sinclair, Earl of Caithness was appointed as general officer commanding Ceylon Army, as such becoming the first commander of the Ceylon Army.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the 1980s, the {{earliest}} known inscription attesting king Odaenathus was dated to 257, leading traditional scholarship to believe that Hairan Ras of Palmyra {{is the father of}} the king and that Odaenathus I was his grandfather.
