Stein's five-man {{defensive}} set-up meant that his midfielders were outnumbered by the Welsh, and consequently Strachan had failed to make an impact on the game up to then. Despite this, Strachan was prepared to argue with Stein that he should remain on, until Alex Ferguson cautioned him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the manager was clearly not well, and should not cause too much stress with a confrontation.|$|E

25|$|While trolls {{believe that}} they do not face {{consequences}} and can troll others on the Internet without repercussions, in the 2000s, due to high-profile cases where cyberbullies have allegedly been factors in suicides attributed to bullying, more laws have been put in place by governments.

Racist trolling has seen individuals been sent to prison for Tweets they have sent that to them may have seemed harmless and not racist. One case of this in recent years is Liam Stacey who was jailed for fifty-six days for tweeting offensive messages such as 'Muamba is dead, hahahaha', referring to when footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed during a professional football game for Bolton Wanders (Williams, 2012).

500|$|As {{the serial}} progressed, Pauline contends with {{a plethora of}} family upsets, which include many deaths—her mother Lou in 1988, brother Pete in 1993 and husband Arthur in 1996—as well as her elder son Mark's fatal battle with HIV. After a year long build-up, Mark is shown to reveal his HIV status to his stunned and devastated parents in an episode that aired on Boxing Day 1991, {{attracting}} 19million viewers. Wendy Richard has given her interpretation of Pauline's reaction to Mark's news: [...] "To say she was shell-shocked was an understatement and, not knowing enough about HIV, she and Arthur were worrying that their eldest son might die from AIDS at any moment." [...] The HIV plot had many ramifications for the character of Pauline, as she struggles {{to come to terms}} with her son's condition. It was also instrumental in raising public awareness about the illness, which was still the subject of much ignorance when EastEnders tackled it in 1991. When the storyline initially aired, more people went for a HIV test in Britain than at any other time. Wendy Richard commented: [...] "The storyline with Mark Fowler, when he announced he was HIV positive, was really well done. People have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> HIV and AIDS are not exactly the same thing.
