5|$|October: Marshall and Warren {{successfully}} <b>treat</b> <b>their</b> first PUD {{patient with}} antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Belief in pig-faced women declined, and {{the last}} {{significant}} work to <b>treat</b> <b>their</b> existence as genuine was published in 1924. Today, the legend is almost forgotten.|$|E
5|$|Good husbandry, proper feeding, and hygiene are {{the main}} {{contributors}} to animal health on the farm, bringing economic benefits through maximised production. When, despite these precautions, animals still become sick, they are treated with veterinary medicines, by the farmer and the veterinarian. In the European Union, when farmers <b>treat</b> <b>their</b> own animals, {{they are required to}} follow the guidelines for treatment and to record the treatments given.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Weizsäcker {{became the}} first head of state of the German Federal Republic to visit Poland. During his four-day visit, he {{reassured}} Poles that the newly unified German state would <b>treat</b> <b>their</b> western and northern borders, which included prewar German lands, as inviolable.|$|E
5|$|A large workhouse such as Whitechapel, {{accommodating}} {{several thousand}} paupers, employed {{a staff of}} almost 200; the smallest may only have had a porter and perhaps an assistant nurse {{in addition to the}} master and matron. A typical workhouse accommodating 225 inmates had a staff of five, which included a part-time chaplain and a part-time medical officer. The low pay meant that many medical officers were young and inexperienced. To add to their difficulties, in most unions they were obliged to pay out of their own pockets for any drugs, dressings or other medical supplies needed to <b>treat</b> <b>their</b> patients.|$|E
5|$|Although As I Lay Dying {{has stated}} on {{numerous}} occasions {{that all of the}} members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. This is largely because the band's lyrics do not directly focus on pro-Christian themes the way many praise music bands do nor do they <b>treat</b> <b>their</b> music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality.|$|E

5000|$|.....no one in {{the band}} <b>treated</b> <b>their</b> {{instrument}} gently this past Saturday night {{on one of the}} last stops of a tour that started in August. All four members of the Shondes <b>treated</b> <b>their</b> Yiddish and classical-influenced post-punk like a heavy object to be lifted and carried. This was especially true of bassist and lead vocalist Louisa Rachel Solomon, who charged at the mic as if to push the song forward with her body.—Venus Zine ...|$|R
50|$|The service {{started to}} use {{thrombolysis}} for suspected heart attacks in October 2003; by 2005 they had <b>treated</b> <b>their</b> 50th patient with this.|$|R
5|$|Hazlitt then {{comments}} {{on some of}} the other characters seen not in isolation but as they interact with and affect one another, comparing and contrasting them to highlight subtle differences. For example, the characters of Goneril and Regan, the comparison of which he begins with a note of personal distaste ("they are so thoroughly hateful that we do not even like to repeat their names"), are shown, he points out, partly in their reaction to their sister Cordelia's desire that they <b>treat</b> <b>their</b> father well—Prescribe not to us our duties—and partly by the contrast of their hypocrisy with the candor of the otherwise evil Edmund.|$|E
5|$|Not only do {{they affect}} injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may <b>treat</b> <b>their</b> patients as asexual, particularly if the injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance {{of the rest of the}} body and of the individual.|$|E
5|$|The two men later reach {{a nature}} reserve {{as the third}} killer shows up. The trio meet their wives, their kids and Kwai's {{syndicate}} during a barbecue. After a tense standoff, they explain that they killed Costello's grandchildren because the children had seen their faces. Not wanting to start a shootout {{in front of the}} three attackers' wives and children, everyone waits until they have left. A moonlit gun battle ensues, with both sides suffering injuries. The three attackers flee, while Costello and Kwai's syndicate take refuge at a run-down apartment in Hong Kong to <b>treat</b> <b>their</b> wounds. Costello reveals that he is a former assassin and has had a bullet in his head for twenty years, which is affecting his memory.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{proponents of}} ancient {{astronaut}} theories (<b>treating</b> <b>their</b> name as nir-vata-kavacha निर्वतकवच, {{which can be}} translated with various meanings including [...] "no-air-garment") theorized that this referred to aliens in spacesuits.|$|R

25|$|The Council {{was equally}} {{responsive}} in establishing social policy. Welfare programs for native populations was established. This included negotiating the first treaties {{to bring in}} the reserve system. Legislation regulating how masters <b>treat</b> <b>their</b> servants was also implemented.|$|E
25|$|After {{the opening}} of the Stratford Festival of Canada in 1958, they created a baseball-themed skit {{involving}} characters from Hamlet and Macbeth. The duo treated these sketches the way singers <b>treat</b> <b>their</b> most popular songs by performing new renditions many times over the years.|$|E

25|$|Although parents <b>treat</b> <b>their</b> {{children}} differently, such {{differential treatment}} explains {{only a small}} amount of nonshared environmental influence. One suggestion is that children react differently to the same environment because of different genes. More likely influences may be the impact of peers and other experiences outside the family.|$|E
25|$|Some advocates {{argue that}} {{punishment}} for crack-using pregnant {{women as a}} means to <b>treat</b> <b>their</b> addiction is a violation of their right to privacy. According to studies, fear of prosecution and having children taken away is associated with a refusal to seek prenatal care or medical treatment.|$|E
