5|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{external}} field, the director of a liquid crystal is free <b>to</b> <b>point</b> in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director <b>to</b> <b>point</b> in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.|$|E

5|$|The {{school was}} re-established in 1946 as No.1 FTS at RAAF Station Uranquinty, New South Wales, and {{transferred}} <b>to</b> <b>Point</b> Cook the following year. Under a restructure of flying training {{to cope with}} the demands of the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, No.1 FTS was re-formed in 1952 as No.1 Applied Flying Training School (No.1 AFTS); it moved to RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, in 1958. For much of this period the school was also responsible for training the RAAF's air traffic controllers. Its pilot trainees included Army, Navy, and foreign students as well as Air Force personnel. The RAAF's reorganisation of aircrew training in the early 1950s had led to the formation at Uranquinty of No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS), which transferred <b>to</b> <b>Point</b> Cook in 1958. In 1969, No.1 AFTS was re-formed as No.2 Flying Training School and No.1 BFTS was re-formed as No.1 FTS. Rationalisation of RAAF flying training resulted in the disbandment of No.1 FTS in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} {{access method}} {{will depend on}} the skills and abilities of the user. With direct selection a body part, pointer, adapted mouse, joystick, or eye tracking could be used, whereas switch access scanning is often used for indirect selection. Unlike direct selection (e.g., typing on a keyboard, touching a screen), users of Target Scanning can only make selections when the scanning indicator (or cursor) of the electronic device is on the desired choice. Those who are unable <b>to</b> <b>point</b> typically calibrate their eyes to use eye gaze as a way <b>to</b> <b>point</b> and blocking as a way to select desired words and phrases. The speed and pattern of scanning, as well as the way items are selected, are individualized to the physical, visual and cognitive capabilities of the user.|$|E

40|$|Posterior-stabilized and {{posterior}} cruciate retaining total knee arthroplasty prostheses {{have had}} high success rates, {{but it is}} unclear whether one design has superior outcomes. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to directly compare the outcomes of these two designs. Forty-five patients who received a posterior-stabilized prosthesis were compared to 46 consecutive patients who received a cruciate-retaining implant. At a mean follow-up time of 60 months (range, 49 to 69 months), the mean Knee Society knee scores improved from 42 <b>points</b> (range, 20 <b>to</b> 73 <b>points)</b> <b>to</b> 93 <b>points</b> (range, 39 <b>to</b> 100 <b>points)</b> for the cruciate-retaining group and from 38 <b>points</b> (range, 20 <b>to</b> 70 <b>points)</b> <b>to</b> 94 <b>points</b> (range, 60 <b>to</b> 100 <b>points)</b> for the posterior-stabilized group. The mean Knee Society functional scores improved from 36 <b>points</b> (range, 10 <b>to</b> 60 <b>points)</b> <b>to</b> 71 <b>points</b> (range, 15 <b>to</b> 100 <b>points)</b> for the cruciate-retaining group and from 32 <b>points</b> (range, 10 <b>to</b> 70 <b>points)</b> <b>to</b> 73 <b>points</b> (range, 32 <b>to</b> 100 <b>points)</b> for the posterior-stabilized group. The ranges of motion were 125 ° (range, 100 to 140 °) and 118 ° (range, 87 to 135 °) in the cruciate-retaining and posterior-stabilized groups, respectively, at final follow-up. Radiographic analysis revealed no radiolucencies that were progressive or were greater than 1 millimeter in length. There were no re-operations in either group. This study did not conclusively demonstrate the superiority of one knee design over the other, suggesting that the choice of implant should be based on surgeon preference and existing pathology of the posterior cruciate ligament...|$|R

The school's commander, Frederick Scherger, advised Cresswell to grow a moustache to overcome his youthful appearance. He was promoted to flight lieutenant in January 1941. Following the bombing of Darwin by Japanese forces on 19February 1942, Cresswell was posted to Williamtown as a liaison officer with the 9th Squadron of the US 49th Pursuit Group (later the 49th Fighter Group), which operated P-40 Kittyhawks and would shortly transfer to Darwin to provide air defence for the North-Western Area.|$|E

5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers <b>to</b> <b>point</b> the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E
5|$|Around AD 30, Jesus and his {{followers}} traveled from Galilee to Jerusalem to observe Passover. Jesus caused a disturbance in the Second Temple, which {{was the center of}} Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished. Jesus had a last meal with his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. Jesus' words are recorded in the Synoptics and in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians. The differences in the accounts cannot be completely reconciled, and {{it is impossible to know}} what Jesus intended, but in general the meal seems <b>to</b> <b>point</b> forward to the coming Kingdom. Jesus probably expected to be killed, and he may have hoped that God would intervene.|$|E
