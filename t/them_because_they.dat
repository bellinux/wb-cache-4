5|$|Bernsten said audiences {{contemporaneous}} {{with the}} first season of Saturday Night Live were not ready for such characters. He said The Land of Gorch characters behaved so uncannily that audiences did not relate to <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> did not foresee hideous puppets behaving in such a mature manner. Bernsten said this was the reason the characters' pithy one-liner jokes succeeded.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive by people who have to take <b>them,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E
5|$|I believe {{also two}} things. As I just said, {{there must be}} no imposition. Secondly, for an {{indefinite}} period – I {{do not know how}} long – I should have, I would have English as an associate, additional language which can be used not because of facilities and all that... but because I do not wish the people of Non-Hindi areas to feel that certain doors of advance are closed to <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are forced to correspond – the Government, I mean – in the Hindi language. They can correspond in English. So I could have it as an alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that – I would leave not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing people.|$|E

5|$|The December 1964 South Vietnamese coup {{took place}} before dawn on December 19, 1964, when the ruling {{military}} junta of South Vietnam led by General Nguyễn Khánh dissolved the High National Council (HNC) and arrested {{some of its}} members. The HNC was an unelected legislative-style civilian advisory body they had created {{at the request of}} the United States—South Vietnam's main sponsor—to give a veneer of civilian rule. The dissolution dismayed the Americans, particularly the ambassador, Maxwell D. Taylor, who engaged in an angry war of words with various generals including Khánh and threatened aid cuts. They were unable to do anything about the fait accompli that had been handed to <b>them,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> strongly desired to win the Vietnam War and needed to support the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. Instead, Taylor's searing verbal attacks were counterproductive as they galvanized the Vietnamese officers around the embattled Khánh. At the time, Khánh's leadership was under threat from his fellow generals, as well as Taylor, who had fallen out with him and was seeking his removal.|$|E

25|$|Europeans brought many {{diseases}} with <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> {{had many}} more domesticated animals than the Native Americans.

25|$|Several other designs {{have been}} tried since then, but they {{required}} the user either to hover awkwardly or to bring her genitals into close contact with the fixture. Most have not caught on. Current clothes fashions, such as panty hose and slacks, inhibit women from using <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> do not want their garments to touch the urinal or the floor. Often, women have little experience with urinals and {{do not know whether}} to approach them forward or backward.|$|E
50|$|Some resisters {{refuse to}} willingly pay only certain taxes, either because those taxes are {{especially}} noxious to <b>them,</b> or <b>because</b> <b>they</b> present a useful symbolic target, or <b>because</b> <b>they</b> {{are more easily}} resisted.|$|R

He had robbed those he killed because he was unemployed at the time, and he needed funds to travel to and from London when hunting for victims.|$|E
25|$|Taqī al-Dīn {{tried to}} {{disprove}} the widely held belief that light is emitted by {{the eye and}} not the object that is being observed. He explained that, if light came from our eyes at a constant velocity it would take much too long to illuminate the stars {{for us to see}} them while we are still looking at <b>them,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are so far away. Therefore, the illumination must be coming from the stars so we can see them as soon as we open our eyes.|$|E

If they have a bad season it could ruin their chances to get into college and therefore into the NBA. It can also be stressful picking a college to play at, which can be unneeded stress if a player decides to leave after only one year.|$|E

25|$|According to two {{different}} Christian traditions, Simon bar Kokhba, {{the leader of}} the second Jewish revolt against Rome (132-136 AD) who was proclaimed Messiah, persecuted the Christians: Justin Martyr claims that Christians were punished if they did not deny and blaspheme Jesus Christ, while Eusebius asserts that Bar Kokhba harassed <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> refused to join his revolt against the Romans. The latter is likely true, and Christians' refusal {{to take part in the}} revolt against the Roman Empire was a key event in the schism of Early Christianity and Judaism.|$|E
25|$|In March 2013, Cuccinelli's {{role in a}} tax dispute case {{came into}} {{question}} when media reported on a lawsuit between the state of Virginia and Star Scientific, a nutritional supplements company. The Washington Post reported that Cuccinelli had failed to disclose investments in Star Scientific for a year; after realizing the oversight, he corrected it and disclosed the holdings. Cuccinelli has disclosed $18,000 in gifts from Star Scientific's chief executive, Jonnie R. Williams. He {{said he could not}} return <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were dinners, vacations, and flights; things that could not be returned. He has sold his stock in the company.|$|E
25|$|In Western Europe and North America, {{the market}} for {{cassettes}} declined sharply after its peak in the late 1980s. This was particularly noticeable with pre-recorded cassettes, the sales of which were overtaken by those of CDs during the early 1990s. By 1993, annual shipments of CD players had reached 5 million, up 21% from the year before; while cassette player shipments had dropped 7% to approximately 3.4 million. The decline continued, and in 2001 cassettes accounted for only 4% of all music sold. Since then, further decline occurred, with very few retailers stocking <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are no longer issued by the major music labels.|$|E
50|$|The {{documents}} the DoD released were incomplete.

25|$|As street {{children}} must provide for themselves, {{work is a}} very important aspect of their lives. Unfortunately, working conditions for {{street children}} are often very poor because they are confined to working in the informal sector, which is unregulated by the government. In Bombay, 50,000 children are illegally employed by 11,750 hotels, restaurants, canteens, tea shops, and eating places. Because of street children's lack of protection from a family and the law, employers often exploit them, making them virtual prisoners, sometimes withholding pay, and abusing them. Employers that would not mistreat the children often will not hire <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are seen as too great of a risk.|$|E
25|$|Human {{rights groups}} have also {{reported}} widespread {{sexual abuse of}} indigenous women in the conflict-ridden eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Despite these risks, Pygmy populations generally have poor access to health services and information about HIV. The British medical journal, The Lancet, published a review showing that Pygmy populations often had worse {{access to health care}} than neighboring communities. According to the report, even where health care facilities exist, many people do not use <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> cannot pay for consultations and medicines, {{they do not have the}} documents and identity cards needed to travel or obtain hospital treatment, and they are subjected to humiliating and discriminatory treatment.|$|E
25|$|On March 10, 1785, King Charles III of Spain {{confirmed}} {{the establishment of}} the Royal Philippine Company with a 25-year charter. The Basque-based company was granted a monopoly on the importation of Chinese and Indian goods into the Philippines, as well as the shipping of the goods directly to Spain via the Cape of Good Hope. The Dutch and British bitterly opposed <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> saw the company as a direct attack on their Asian trade. It also faced the hostility of the traders of the Galleon trade (see above) who saw it as competition. This gradually resulted in the death of both institutions: The Royal Philippine Company in 1814 and the Galleon trade in 1815.|$|E
