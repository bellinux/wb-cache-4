5|$|Patching was one {{of several}} backstrokers who had slipped on the {{starting}} area earlier in the meet, so Kerry decided to rub a sticky red substance onto <b>the</b> <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> feet. The Soviet organisers had provided a carpet following the incidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium. Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best. He finished his leg in 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place. Kuznetsov gave the Soviets the lead after posting a time of 56.81s, with Hungary and Great Britain in second and third place. France was the last to reach the 100m mark, recording a time of 58.84s. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, the fastest split among the breaststrokers by 0.63s. His leg moved Australia into second place at the halfway mark, just 0.45s behind the hosts and roughly half a second ahead of the British and the Hungarians. The four leading teams had broken away, leaving a two-second gap back to the fifth-placed East Germans.|$|E
5|$|As Patching {{had slipped}} {{earlier in the}} meet, Kerry decided to rub a sticky red {{substance}} onto <b>the</b> <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> feet. The Soviet hosts had installed a carpet following the incidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium. Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, {{but it was still}} two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place {{at the end of the}} first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, drawing Australia almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Tonelli swam his leg in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster than he had done over the distance. Tonelli did so with an uneven arm technique due to the uneven strength in his arms. He began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre by the end of his leg. Brooks then executed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. He had drawn level by the halfway mark and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler pulled level at the 25m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his teammates. The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. The team then made a celebratory dive into the pool and were interviewed poolside. In 2000, Kerry and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the Australian Sports Medal for their victory in Moscow.|$|E
25|$|They took {{extended}} traveling tours. In January 1925 {{they traveled}} to North Africa where they first smoked opium, a habit {{to which they}} would return again and again. Crosby had tattoos on <b>the</b> <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> feet—a cross on one and a pagan sun symbol on the other.|$|E
60|$|They {{were very}} ashamed, but Tootles gave <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoe, {{and it made}} an {{excellent}} knocker.|$|R

25|$|Carla Jean {{returns from}} her mother's funeral to find Chigurh waiting in her bedroom. She refuses his {{offer of a}} coin toss for her life, stating that the choice is his own. Chigurh leaves the house and {{carefully}} checks <b>the</b> <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boots. As he drives through town, he is injured in a car accident, bribes two young witnesses for their silence, and flees.|$|E
25|$|A diner is a {{restaurant}} {{characterized by a}} wide range of foods, a casual and often nostalgic atmosphere, a counter, and late operating hours. The precursor to the fast food eatery began in 1872 when Walter Scott, a myopic pressman for the Providence Journal, became serious about selling food and refreshments in the streets. Scott had a plan. Instead of wearing out <b>the</b> <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoes and roaming the streets of Providence, Rhode Island, he decided to buy a horse-drawn delivery van. Rolling on four wagon wheels, he would take his food to the people.|$|E
500|$|As {{the weather}} cleared on 11 January, Mawson {{continued}} west, estimating the distance back to Cape Denison at [...] He travelled 2miles before {{pain in his}} feet forced him to stop; he found that <b>the</b> <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> feet had separated as a complete layer. Applying lanolin {{to his feet and}} wrapping them in several pairs of socks under his boots, he continued. [...] "My whole body is apparently rotting from lack of nourishment" [...] he recorded, [...] "frost-bitten fingertips festering, mucous membrane of nose gone, saliva glands of mouth refusing duty, skin coming off whole body". Averaging around 5miles a day, he began to cross the Mertz Glacier. On 17 January he broke through the lid of a crevasse, but the rope around his waist held him to the sledge and halted his fall.|$|E
5000|$|One of Philip K. Dick's {{characters}} in A Scanner Darkly tells a drug-induced story wherein a worker {{at the local}} microdot factory had tracked the company's entire inventory out {{into the parking lot}} on <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoe.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} brace up and try, mamma; for as Mr. Fulkerson says, it's {{as sure as}} guns. From the crown <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head to <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> foot, he's loathsome to me; and he keeps getting loathsomer. Ugh! Goodnight!" ...|$|R
60|$|In {{his mind}} Findlayson had already {{escaped from the}} boat, and was {{circling}} high in air to find a rest for <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> foot. His body--he was really sorry for its gross helplessness--lay in the stern, the water rushing about its knees.|$|R
500|$|Philitas {{was thin}} and frail, and may have {{suffered}} and died from a wasting disease. He seems to have died in Cos sometime in the 280sBC. His pupil Hermesianax wrote that a statue of him was erected under a plane tree {{by the people of}} Cos, depicting him as [...] "frail with all the glosses". His contemporary Posidippus wrote that Philadelphus commissioned a bronze of Philitas in old age from the sculptor Hecataeus, which [...] "included nothing from the physique of heroes. No,... he cast the old man full of cares." [...] The 3rd centuryAD Roman author Aelian skeptically passed along a story that Philitas was so thin that he put lead weights in <b>the</b> <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoes to avoid being blown away by a stiff wind.|$|E
2500|$|Douglas {{was one of}} {{the first}} shoe {{manufacturers}} to widely advertise his products. [...] He stamped <b>the</b> <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoes with his own image (a use he took up after he saw P. T. Barnum's advertising), making it one of the most recognized likenesses of the time. [...] One period writer believed Douglas was likely the most widely recognized figure in the state.|$|E
2500|$|NPR critic Bob Mondello {{adds that}} [...] "despite {{working with a}} plot about implacable malice, the Coen Brothers don't ever overdo. You could even say they know the value of understatement: At one point they garner chills simply by having a {{character}} check <b>the</b> <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boots as he steps from a doorway into the sunlight. By that time, blood has pooled often enough in No Country for Old Men that they don't have {{to show you what}} he's checking for." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, al-Qaeda member Richard Reid, the [...] "Shoe Bomber", used PETN in <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoe in his {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt to}} blow up American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami. He had intended to use the solid triacetone triperoxide (TATP) as a detonator.|$|R

6000|$|... "Jump into a tree!" [...] cried Dave, {{and showed}} the way. The others followed, {{clutching}} at some low-hanging branches and pulling themselves up as rapidly as possible. Dave and Sam were soon safe, but the mastiff, making a bound, caught Phil by <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoe.|$|R
2500|$|At Cuauhtémoc's request, Cortés {{also allowed}} the {{defeated}} Mexica to depart the city unmolested. Subsequently, however, when the booty found did not {{measure up to}} the Spaniards' expectations, Cuauhtémoc was subjected to [...] "torture by fire", whereby <b>the</b> <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bare feet were slowly broiled over red-hot coals, in an unsuccessful attempt to discover its whereabouts. On the statue to Cuauhtemoc, on the Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City, there is a bas relief showing the Spaniards' torture of the emperor. Eventually, some gold was recovered but far less than Cortés and his men expected.|$|E
2500|$|During interrogations US {{soldiers}} would {{ask a question}} such as [...] "where is Osama?" [...] and punch {{him in the face}} when he said he didn't know. [...] "Hour upon hour, they repeated the same questions accompanied by punches and kicks," [...] Kurnaz recalled in his memoirs. The interrogators refused to believe his protestations of innocence. He saw seven soldiers using rifle butts to beat another prisoner to death. The abuse of Kurnaz escalated to include [...] electric shock prods applied to <b>the</b> <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> feet, until the unendurable pain caused him to pass out. His head was repeatedly pushed into a bucket of water until he blacked out from lack of oxygen.|$|E
2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the book, Moss's widow {{returns home}} to find Chigurh inside, waiting for her. After hearing her pleas for mercy, he {{partially}} relents by relying on his coin toss. In the book, she calls heads; it comes up tails, and he shoots and kills her. In the film adaptation, she refuses to call the toss, saying [...] "The coin don't have no say. [...] It's just you." [...] The movie then cuts to a shot of Chigurh leaving the house, checking <b>the</b> <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boots, implying that he has killed her. [...] While driving away from her house some three blocks away, Chigurh is badly injured in a car accident, sustaining a compound fracture of his left ulna and walking away with a limp. At the collision scene, before the authorities arrive, he offers $100 to a teenager on a bicycle to give him his shirt, seeking to use it to bind up his wounds himself. Chigurh then flees the scene before the ambulance arrives.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{put that}} mouse in my desk?" [...] said Anne. Her voice was quite low {{but it made}} a shiver {{go up and down}} Paul Irving's spine.

50|$|Boy with Thorn, {{also called}} Fedele (Fedelino) or Spinario, is a Greco-Roman Hellenistic bronze {{sculpture}} of a boy withdrawing a thorn from <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> foot, now in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, Rome.

60|$|Sam thrilled {{from the}} top of his head to <b>the</b> <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> feet. It was the voice which had been ringing in his ears through all his waking hours.|$|E
60|$|It was the drummer-boy who {{had been}} hanging round him all the forenoon--a fat and {{freckled}} person of about fourteen, and Kim loathed him from <b>the</b> <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boots to his cap-ribbons.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And is it far yet?' {{said the}} old people, who were {{beginning}} to be worn out by the long journey. The man held up his foot {{so that they could}} see <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoe; it was worn as thin as paper, and there was a hole in the middle of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't mean that," [...] said Sir James, who, {{after putting}} down {{his hat and}} {{throwing}} himself into a chair, had begun to nurse his leg and examine <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boot with much bitterness. [...] "I mean this marriage. I mean his letting that blooming young girl marry Casaubon." ...|$|R

60|$|For {{one moment}} the gush {{of the old}} fierce spirit almost overcame the poor youth, but sudden {{reflection}} and certain tender sensations about <b>the</b> <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> feet came to his aid, in time to prevent a catastrophe.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! That he {{was afraid}} <b>the</b> <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boots were not fit for walking, as they were a good deal worn when he came in; {{and that he would}} thank me very much to have them mended, ready.' ...|$|E

60|$|The poet, {{it must be}} said, {{is as old as}} civilization.

This can now be done by electricity, but the Romans did not know it.|$|R
