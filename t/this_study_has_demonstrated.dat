50|$|<b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>has</b> <b>demonstrated</b> that Ar. ramidus evolved its {{idiosyncratic}} skull morphology via paedomorphosis. In {{terms of}} cranial base angulation, {{length of the}} face and vocal tract ratios, Ar. ramidus shows greater affinity with infant and juvenile, than with adult chimpanzees...These findings provide further support for Gould’s (1977) contention that neoteny, or the retention of juvenile characters into the period of sexual maturity, was an important adaptive strategy in the hominin lineage. Gould proposed that the incipient process of hominization {{at the base of}} the hominin clade involved the dissociation of somatic growth from sexual maturation, resulting in the retention of sub-adult traits into the period of sexual maturity -which is what we see in Ar. ramidus.|$|E
50|$|The {{results of}} a Phase III trial were {{published}} in October 2011 in Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. Vol 68, pages 945-950 (Open access at http://www.springerlink.com/content/c2624362664404t5/). This study used Lipoplatin in combination with paclitaxel as first line treatment against ns-NSCLC and compared response rates and toxicities to a similar group of patients treated with cisplatin plus paclitaxel. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>has</b> <b>demonstrated</b> an increase in tumor response rate in the Lipoplatin arm (59.22% of patients) versus the cisplatin arm (42.42%, of patients) which was statistically significant (p value = 0.036). Most major toxicities of cisplatin, especially nephrotoxicity were also reduced {{in the group of}} patients treated with Lipoplatin. Median survival times were 10 months for the Lipoplatin arm and 8 months for the cisplatin arm, with a p-value of 0.155. The median duration of response was 7 months for the Lipoplatin arm and 6 months for the cisplatin arm. Although not statistically significant, these results suggest the potential for superior overall survival (OS) for Lipoplatin compared to cisplatin, a hypothesis that is being tested in a larger trial. Furthermore, among the responders to Lipoplatin a subgroup of patients demonstrated a substantially higher overall survival than a comparable subgroup of cisplatin responders. After 10 months, 30% of patients in the Lipoplatin arm, as compared with just 16% of patients in the cisplatin arm, were without disease progression. By the end of the trial, there were 32 patients alive, 21 from the Lipoplatin arm (20.39%) and 11 from the cisplatin arm (11.11%). Thus, after 18 months, the number of surviving patients was approximately double for Lipoplatin versus cisplatin. The clinical development of Lipoplatin in adenocarcinomas establishes this drug as the most active platinum drug with significantly lower side effects.|$|E

30|$|The glandular trichome {{morphology}} {{is largely}} influenced by mycorrhizal and the hydric state of plant; the observations made in <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>have</b> <b>demonstrated</b> {{the existence of}} two types of peltate glands according to their shape: inflated glands and deflated glands. Mycorrhization provides for plants an optimal nutrition as well as hydric or mineral, allowing the leaves to receive the water and nutrients in roughly sufficient quantities. This water inlet provides a turgor state of epidermal cells and secretory cells of the gland, causing swelling of cavities and magnification.|$|R

30|$|Although LiDAR {{constitutes}} an additional cost, {{the results of}} <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>have</b> <b>demonstrated</b> that plot sampling intensity can be reduced yet still achieve the targeted level of precision for stand volume estimates. Typical softwood plantation inventory costs in Australia average around AU$ 100 per management plot. This equates to approximately AU$ 25 per hectare, depending on topography, weed occurrence and abundance, and time of measurement (Chen and Zhu 2012; D. Watt, Planning Manager, FCNSW, pers. comm.). Also, LiDAR survey costs can vary considerably depending {{on the cost of}} aircraft mobilisation and flight distance and the specifications of the data being acquired. The net benefits, therefore, need to be confirmed through a cost efficiency analysis taking into account local requirements, conditions and circumstances.|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of three environmentally sound processes for small energetic component disposal was examined experimentally in <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> The three destruction methods, batch reactor supercritical water oxidation, sodium hydroxide base hydrolysis and calcium carbonate cookoff were {{selected based on}} their potential for producing a clean solid residue and a minimum release of toxic gases after component detonation. The explosive hazard was destroyed by all three processes. Batch supercritical water oxidation destroyed both the energetics and organics.
