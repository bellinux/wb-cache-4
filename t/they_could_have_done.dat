5|$|Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) is outed at {{his school}} and {{subsequently}} bullied by his teammates {{in the locker}} room. He is also mercilessly attacked online. Karofsky, devastated, attempts suicide by hanging, but is saved in time by his father. The news causes shock at his old school, McKinley High: Members of the staff believe <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> more to help him {{when he had been}} a student there, while Kurt blames himself for ignoring Karofsky's repeated phone calls that week. It also shocks Sebastian, who had cruelly rebuffed Karofsky at a gay bar, and he destroys the photos of Finn, thus abandoning his attempt at blackmail. New Directions coach Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has all of the members reveal something they are looking forward to in the future, to remind them that no matter how low they think their lives have sunk, they should not forget what is ahead of them. Rachel and Finn apologize to each other, and decide to get married the day after Regionals.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, {{while working}} in New York City, Fanti started the {{psychotherapy}} of a diplomat who was representing his country {{in a series of}} international conferences. His treatment was a man of success with a brilliant career but anguished to the extreme of considering his life senseless. Fanti and his patient completed nine sessions of 45 minutes. Suddenly the diplomat was transferred to another country due to professional requirements and he therefore interrupted his treatment. A few months later, Fanti received a thankful letter from his client for all the work done with him but announcing he had committed suicide. This tragic event disturbed Fanti profoundly. He reflected about the clinical aspects of his client's case, trying to understand what he should have done differently so as to avoid his client committing suicide. He had a sense that if during those 15 days the psychoanalysis had lasted <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> more frequent and longer sessions, his client {{would have been able to}} discharge enough anxiety as to permit him to pull through temporally. At a later stage he could have continued a psychoanalysis to seek a definitive equilibrium.|$|E
500|$|Historian Seth Jacobs {{asserted}} that Đức had [...] "reduced America's Diệm experiment to ashes as well" [...] and that [...] "no amount of pleading could retrieve Diệm's reputation" [...] once Browne's images had become ingrained into {{the psyche of}} the world public. Ellen Hammer described the event as having [...] "evoked dark images of persecution and horror corresponding to a profoundly Asian reality that passed the understanding of Westerners." [...] John Mecklin, an official from the U.S. embassy, noted that the photograph [...] "had a shock effect of incalculable value to the Buddhist cause, becoming {{a symbol of the}} state of things in Vietnam." [...] William Colby, then chief of the Central Intelligence Agency's Far East Division, opined that Diệm [...] "handled the Buddhist crisis fairly badly and allowed it to grow. But I really don't think there was much <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> about it once that bonze burned himself." ...|$|E

'I {{knew nothing of}} it,' she exclaimed; 'I know we hurried away from our hotel, {{and they told me}} {{afterwards}} that Warbles had recognised some one he knew on board a steamer that had just come in.

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning praised 30 Rock {{for putting}} {{it all together}} [...] "so seamlessly" [...] and [...] "so brilliantly balanced" [...] in [...] "Señor Macho Solo". Canning enjoyed Tracy's story, observing {{that it was a}} [...] "fantastic Tracy Jordan moment." [...] He complimented Sherri Shepherd's guest spot, writing that it was a great way to bring her back [...] "into the mix". He also liked that this episode [...] "delivered some great work" [...] from Alec Baldwin. In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 9.3 out of 10 rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger appreciated Jenna's subplot as it was [...] "the first really work-centric one in a while." [...] He complimented Peter Dinklage's appearance, but was less enthusiastic about Salma Hayek being a love interest for Baldwin's Jack, citing that he did not buy her in the Elisa role. Kona Gallagher of AOL's TV Squad said that Dinklage, Hayek, and Shepherd [...] "fit into the episode, instead of feeling like the episode was written around them." [...] Gallagher noted that Dinklage was [...] "pretty awesome" [...] as Tina Fey's love interest, [...] "and I would have loved to see more of them together. I really think <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> more with this storyline." [...] According to Gallagher, the only part of [...] "Señor Macho Solo" [...] that she was not [...] "crazy about" [...] was Jenna playing Janis Joplin.|$|E
500|$|For each mission, {{a player}} {{is given a}} {{briefing}} in regards to it, which details relevant information on what the mission is about, what to expect, and what objectives {{are expected to be}} completed, although not all actual situations and objectives are detailed. In between some missions, players are also given a command briefing, stating the current situation of the campaign, as well as information on any new ships and weapons being released for use. Before flying out on a mission, players can modify the ship and weapons load-outs for their own starfighter and those of their own wingmen and other wings for the mission; for some missions, the load-out is either fixed for the mission, or is whatever the player set up in the previous one, while what ships and weapons are available depend on the progress on the mission, with stronger weapons and ships becoming available only in later missions. The level of control over load-outs prior to committing to a mission adds an element of strategy to the campaign. The results of a mission can often affect how later missions play out; for example, an enemy capital ship allowed to flee in a particular mission may return in a later mission. Completing a mission and leaving when given authorisation, leads to a debriefing screen which outlays what was achieved by the player and any aspects that could have been done better; players can get a hint, defined as [...] "recommendations", to see what <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> better, and can restart a mission to play the mission out differently. Player's can earn medals after some missions, either for completing a specific mission, or achieving certain hidden criteria/bonus objectives, receive promotions depending on the kills and types of alongside the difficulty being played at, and badges for overall total of kills made by them. Furthermore, players can replay any single player mission they complete through the in-game mission simulator.|$|E

60|$|The three {{travellers}} drank their tea and smacked their lips, {{and grinned}} {{at each other}} with great satisfaction. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> more if it had been the best of brandy and they the jolliest of topers!

2500|$|Despite {{finding no}} {{evidence}} of legal wrongdoing, McClellan continued to smear Barasch's management of his unions in the media. Yet, McClellan could not produce any reports of union members [...] "losing medical or dental care," [...] which he alleged would happen {{as a result of}} the reorganization of funds. The Herald Tribune reported that [...] "none of the members of either of his two unions seem to have lodged a protest." [...] One witness, W. Rutherford James, testified that welfare payments were consistently being made to his wholesale drug company Towns and James as expected. Ironically, McClellan's finding that the funds of the foundations [...] "could have been disposed of or distributed at the whim of the principals of these corporations" [...] and [...] "had they decided to divide [...] among themselves, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so freely and with apparent legal impunity," [...] in the absence of Barasch or his associates ever doing so, provided support for Barasch's good intentions, consistent with his early union activities.|$|E

50|$|Lucas, Gustavo, Leandro and Pedro met in {{high school}} and were part of the student council. After a meeting in late 1999 they had the idea to start a band so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> fun <b>doing</b> punk {{versions}} of pop hits of the time. Lucas and Gustavo played the guitar, Pedro had a drum kit and Leandro would be the singer.|$|R

60|$|The Saulteaux, of course, {{might have}} also taken {{advantage}} of this circumstance, but <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so only on foot, and they knew that without canoes they could not arrest {{the progress of the}} fugitives.|$|E
60|$|The {{suspense}} was dreadful. Had it been day, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> {{something to}} further the search, but the night held them impotent and they knew they must wear out the dreary hours as best they might.|$|E
60|$|Then {{those two}} rabbits lost their heads completely. They did the most foolish thing that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> They rushed into their short new tunnel, and hid {{themselves}} at the top end of it, under Mr. Tod's kitchen floor.|$|E

5000|$|After 20 {{years of}} researching General Motors, Bradford Snell stated, [...] "General Motors {{was far more}} {{important}} to the Nazi war machine than Switzerland ...

50|$|In another {{interrogation}} technique, suspects {{explain how}} a crime {{might have been}} committed or how <b>they</b> themselves <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it. This practice has been suggested as another cause of self-generated false confessions, by forcing an innocent suspect to create a believable narrative of their own guilt. This is supported by research in which people explained how a false childhood event <b>could</b> <b>have</b> occurred, and became more confident that it had really happened.|$|R

60|$|These {{tables were}} made of stone, of hewn stones, on which this work was done (Eze 40:40-43).
