5|$|In 1999, the {{granular}} pavement {{section of}} Highway 2 south of Watrous was tested {{with a cold}} in-place recycling or “CIR” method to rehabilitate highways. This CIR process is a cost-effective method which recycles the <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> of a road. This pulverized material is mixed with asphalt emulsion and spread and compacted back onto the highway surface. This surface is then recovered with a new seal dependent on traffic volume.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} any liquid is an {{interface}} between that liquid {{and some other}} medium. The <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> of a pond, for example, is an interface between the pond water and the air. Surface tension, then, is not a property of the liquid alone, but a property of the liquid's interface with another medium. If a liquid is in a container, then besides the liquid/air interface at its <b>top</b> <b>surface,</b> {{there is also an}} interface between the liquid and the walls of the container. The surface tension between the liquid and air is usually different (greater than) its surface tension with the walls of a container. And where the two surfaces meet, their geometry must be such that all forces balance.|$|E
5|$|As a {{three-way}} loudspeaker system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange are {{mounted on the}} <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the midrange is mounted in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3kHz between the tweeter and midrange. The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E

5|$|The car {{appeared}} in the early 20th century to be pulled by horse again in the dirty thirties. In 1906, cars could be registered, and plates were issued as early as 1912. In the late 1920s the roads were gravelled near the larger centers such as Yorkton, Saskatoon, the Battlefords, and Lloydminster. All-weather roads were developed in the 1930s, which began to depart from the surveyed township roads connecting centres directly. Roads also were constructed to allow for rain run-off, with a rounded <b>top</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
5|$|An old style mercury {{barometer}} {{consists of a}} vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level {{at the center of}} the tube is higher than at the edges, making the upper surface of the mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> of the mercury were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} column consisted of ten cervical (neck), twelve dorsal, six fused sacral and {{an unknown number}} of caudal (tail) vertebrae. The neck was nearly straight, rather than having the S-curve seen in other theropods, and also unusually wide, especially towards its base. The top of the neck's spinal column featured a double row of enlarged, upwardly directed bony processes called epipophyses, creating a smooth trough {{on the top of the}} neck vertebrae. These processes were the highest points of the spine, towering above the unusually low spinous processes. The epipophyses probably provided attachment areas for a markedly strong neck musculature. A similar double row was also present in the tail, formed there by highly modified caudal ribs, in front view protruding upwards in a V-shape, their inner sides creating a smooth, flat, <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> of the front tail vertebrae. The end of each caudal rib was furnished with a forward projecting hook-shaped expansion that connected to the caudal rib of the preceding vertebra.|$|E

5|$|This subtype {{makes up}} about 10% {{of all cases}} of aphthous stomatitis. It is termed major aphthous {{ulceration}} (MaAU) or major recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MaRAS). Major aphthous ulcers (major aphthae) are similar to minor aphthous ulcers, but are more than 10mm in diameter and the ulceration is deeper. Because the lesions are larger, healing takes longer (about twenty to thirty days), and may leave scars. Each episode of ulceration usually produces {{a greater number of}} ulcers, and the time between attacks is less than seen in minor aphthous stomatitis. Major aphthous ulceration usually affects non keratinized mucosal surfaces, but less commonly keratinized mucosa may also be involved, such as the dorsum (<b>top</b> <b>surface)</b> of the tongue or the gingiva (gums). The soft palate or the fauces (back of the throat) may also be involved, the latter being part of the oropharynx rather than the oral cavity. Compared to minor aphthous ulceration, major aphthae tend to have an irregular outline.|$|E
5|$|Gordon's {{arguments}} are valid {{for the second}} phase (1879–84) when every stone laid required a skilled stonemason. However, Holland's views are valid for the first phase (1848–54) because much of its construction only required unskilled manual labor, assisted only by a steam engine to lift the stones because many weighed several tons each. Only {{a small number of}} stones used in the first phase required a skilled stonemason, the marble blocks on the outer surface of the monument (their inner surfaces were left very rough) and those gneiss stones that form the rough inner walls of the monument (all other surfaces of those inner stones within the walls were left jagged). The vast majority of all gneiss stones laid during the first phase, those between the outer and inner surfaces of the walls, from very large to very small jagged stones, form a pile of rubble held together by a large amount of mortar. The <b>top</b> <b>surface</b> of this rubble can be seen below at Walls in an 1880 drawing made just before the polished/rough marble and granite stones used in the second phase were laid atop it. The original foundation below the walls was made of layered gneiss rubble, but without the massive stones used within the walls. Most of the gneiss stones used during the first phase were obtained from quarries in the Potomac Valley. Only the marble stones of the first and second phases came from Maryland quarries north of Baltimore.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the problem {{regarding}} the rapid NC machining programming for <b>top</b> planar <b>surface</b> of ribs in aircraft structural parts, an approach based on skeleton extraction technique is presented here to generate tool path for <b>top</b> planar <b>surface.</b> Firstly, the constrained Delaunay triangulation is built to split the rib <b>top</b> planar <b>surface</b> into several sub areas and approximate skeleton branch of each sub area is extracted. Then based on these skeleton branches and process scheme, the set of machining cells of the rib <b>top</b> planar <b>surface</b> is constructed. Secondly, the problem on determining the sequence of machining cells is resolved by optimizing the machining path. Finally, the sequence of machining cells can be converted into the machining cells chain from which tool path can be calculated by CAM systems. Based on the experimental results of the comparison between the generalized pocket method and our approach, our approach is found to be more efficient in generating tool path for <b>top</b> planar <b>surface</b> of ribs...|$|R

40|$|The microstructures of spray-formed billets of {{commercial}} Al alloy 2618 {{have been investigated}} {{as a function of}} spray-forming conditions and alloy composition. The porosity, grain size and aluminide particle size vary through the thickness of the billet in an initial region. The billet microstructures then develop approximately steady-state conditions. The porosity, grain size and aluminide particle sizes are correlated with thermal conditions on the <b>top</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the billets during spray forming, which in turn are correlated with spray-forming process parameters. The results are explained in terms of the relative fractions of liquid and solid on the billet <b>top</b> <b>surfaces</b> during spray forming.
