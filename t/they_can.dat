5|$|In music, birdsong has {{influenced}} composers and musicians in several ways: <b>they</b> <b>can</b> {{be inspired by}} birdsong; <b>they</b> <b>can</b> intentionally imitate bird song in a composition, as Vivaldi and Beethoven did, along with many later composers; <b>they</b> <b>can</b> incorporate recordings of birds into their works, first seen {{in the work of}} Ottorino Respighi; or as Beatrice Harrison did in 1924 with a nightingale, and David Rothenberg did in 2000 with a laughingthrush, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> duet with birds.|$|E

5|$|Active and cheerful, the Russian Toy was {{originally}} bred {{both as an}} anti-rat dog and a watch dog. The second quality is still active in the breed, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be very vocal. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> become quite attached to their family, regardless of {{the ages of the}} family members. Russian Toys are usually very reserved with strangers, but very loyal to their owners, always ready to protect them from any perceived danger.|$|E

5|$|Although Cuban iguanas {{typically}} remain {{still for}} long periods of time and have a slow lumbering gait due to their body mass, they are capable of quick bursts of speed for short distances. Younger animals are more arboreal and will seek refuge in trees, which <b>they</b> <b>can</b> climb with great agility. The animal is a capable swimmer and will take to nearby water if threatened. When cornered <b>they</b> <b>can</b> bite and lash their tails in defense.|$|E
5|$|Although {{happy in}} the company of others, they are fine if left alone. Sealyham Terriers are suited for both the town and country. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> be stubborn, vocal, and boisterous but also full of personality. While they make for loyal family companions, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be trained to be working dogs, making them {{excellent}} mousers or ratters. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> also be taught as a puppy to get along with other animals, including cats and birds.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea that}} {{non-human}} animals might not feel pain {{goes back to}} the 17th-century French philosopher, René Descartes, who argued that animals do not experience pain and suffering because they lack consciousness. [...] In 1789, the British philosopher and social reformist, Jeremy Bentham, addressed in his book An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation the issue of our treatment of animals with the following often quoted words: [...] "The question is not, <b>Can</b> <b>they</b> reason? nor, <b>can</b> <b>they</b> talk? but, <b>Can</b> <b>they</b> suffer?" ...|$|R
5|$|Because Clumber Spaniels {{are large}} boned and fast growing, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> suffer from {{temporary}} lameness from between six and twelve months of age, with this lameness subsiding when bone growth is complete. Another common condition that the breed suffers from are impacted anal sacs {{and the dog}} may require them to be emptied by a veterinarian. The final common condition that the breed has is heat sensitivity: if Clumber Spaniels are left without shade, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> become uncomfortably hot and dehydrated.|$|E
5|$|Chicken {{hearts are}} {{considered}} to be giblets, and are often grilled on skewers: Japanese hāto yakitori, Brazilian churrasco de coração, Indonesian chicken heart satay. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> also be pan-fried, as in Jerusalem mixed grill. In Egyptian cuisine, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be used, finely chopped, as part of stuffing for chicken.

5|$|Cumulus humilis clouds usually {{indicate}} fair weather. Cumulus mediocris {{clouds are}} similar, {{except that they}} have some vertical development, which implies that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> grow into cumulus congestus or even cumulonimbus clouds, which can produce heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even tornadoes. Cumulus congestus clouds, which appear as towers, will often grow into cumulonimbus storm clouds. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> produce precipitation. Glider pilots often {{pay close attention to}} cumulus clouds, as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be indicators of rising air drafts or thermals underneath that can suck the plane high into the skya phenomenon known as cloud suck.|$|E

Getting {{the right people}} to the right places at the right time, with proper support, {{is critical to the}} success of far-flung businesses. Human resource professionals and corporate counsel are confronted with a maze of legal issues that must be considered before moving employees across borders. When <b>can</b> <b>they</b> go? How long <b>can</b> <b>they</b> stay? What <b>can</b> <b>they</b> do while there? <b>Can</b> <b>they</b> work? How <b>can</b> <b>they</b> be paid? What happens to their employment benefits during the trip? Who will be the employer during the trip? What are the tax consequences of the trip to the employer and the foreign employee? What about their family? These issues confront employers dealing with short-term business travelers, as well as long-term, employment assignments.

5|$|English verbs are inflected for {{tense and}} aspect, and marked for {{agreement}} with third person singular subject. Only the copula verb {{to be is}} still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects. Auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form complex tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be followed by the negation, and in that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.|$|E

5|$|In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can {{separate}} their calls and returning echoes by time. They have to time their short calls to finish before echoes return.

The time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> clearly hear the returning echo.
