5|$|After the 1963 season, {{the team}} fell apart. A roster filled with mostly older {{veterans}} plus some bad personnel moves (e.g. the dispatching of Rosey Grier, Sam Huff, and Don Chandler) lead <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> {{exit from the}} top of the standings. The Giants finished 2–10–2 in 1964, beginning an 18-season playoff drought.|$|E
5|$|Super Bowl XXV {{took place}} amidst a {{background}} of war and patriotism. The Persian Gulf War had begun {{less than two weeks}} previous, and the nation rallied around the Super Bowl as a symbol of America. The Giants got off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> 3–0 lead; however, the Bills scored the next 12 points. The Giants responded by running a nearly eight-minute drive, which culminated in a 14-yard touchdown pass from Hostetler to Stephen Baker.|$|E
5|$|The Giants' record rebounded to 9–7 in 1984, and Taylor had {{his fourth}} All-Pro season. He got off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> start, {{recording}} four sacks in a September game. In the playoffs the Giants defeated the Los Angeles Rams 16–13, but lost 21–10 to the eventual champion 49ers.|$|E

5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match was}} Razor Ramon versus Ted DiBiase. DiBiase got off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> start by attacking Ramon before the match began. Ramon quickly turned the match around with several clotheslines. DiBiase regained control before untying a turnbuckle cover. Ramon won the match after ramming DiBiase's {{head into the}} exposed turnbuckle and using the Razor's Edge to get the pin.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{jumped out}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> 28–7 {{lead in the}} first two {{quarters}} of play, but the Hokies closed the lead to a 28–14 margin by halftime with a 3-yard run from Vick. In the second half, Tech made its biggest run of the game as Kicker Shayne Graham kicked a field goal and tailback Andre Kendrick added two rushing touchdowns to give the Hokies their first and only lead—29–28—with just over three minutes left in the third quarter. But in the end, the Hokies could not contain Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke, who threw twotouchdowns in the fourth quarter and 329yards in the game. The Seminoles defeated Virginia Tech 46–29.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Mets won the National League Championship Series {{for their}} fifth pennant while the Phillies entered a rebuild phase. The Mets beat the Phillies 14 times and lost 5 for a {{lopsided}} season series. The season still provided contentious moments such as, Mets pitcher Matt Harvey drilling Phillies 2nd baseman Chase Utley {{in retaliation for}} Mets players getting hit by Phillies pitchers, a benches clearing argument between Phillies coach Larry Bowa in regards <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> pitch by Hansel Robles and a bat flip by Daniel Murphy.

5|$|McGovern–Hatfield {{was put up}} for a vote {{again in}} 1971, with {{somewhat}} weaker provisions designed to gain more support. In polls, a large majority of the public now favored its intent, and McGovern took his name off a final form of it, as some senators were just objecting to him. Nevertheless, in June 1971, it failed to pass again, gaining only a few more votes than the year before. McGovern was now certain that the only way the war would come <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> end was if there was a new president.|$|E
5|$|On 28 September 1990, the Division Support Command {{deployed}} to the Middle East {{in support of}} Operation Desert Shield. In January 1991, Division Support Command provided support to the 1st Cavalry Division throughout Operation Desert Storm, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> liberation of Kuwait. On 16 December 1991, the 215th Forward Support Battalion was activated at Fort Hood bringing the number of active duty forward support battalions to three. On 8 July 1996, the 615th Support Battalion (Aviation) was provisionally organized. The battalion was formally activated on 17 September 1996.|$|E
5|$|The Bulldogs {{opened the}} 1920 season against the Pitcairn Quakers. The team got out <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> lead {{and was never}} in danger, scoring 34 {{points in the first}} quarter as back Joe Guyon rushed for three {{touchdown}}s, tackle Pete Henry caught a 15-yard touchdown pass from back Tex Grigg, and back Johnny Hendren returned an interception for a touchdown. The Bulldogs were only forced to punt once in the game, and did not attempt to score {{in the second and third}} quarters because of the large lead. In the fourth quarter, however, end Bunny Corcoran caught a 35-yard touchdown pass from Guyon, and back Ike Martin ran for a one-yard touchdown. The final score was 48–0, and Guyon was the offensive star.|$|E

In this way, discontinuities are avoided, even if the shape requires difficult-to-fill thin sections. This creates the problem of air entrapment, because when the mold is filled quickly there is little time for the air to escape. This problem is minimized by including vents along the parting lines, however, even in a highly refined process there will still be some porosity {{in the center of the}} casting.|$|E
5|$|In 118 BC, King Micipsa of Numidia (current-day Algeria and Tunisia) died. He was {{succeeded by}} two {{legitimate}} sons, Adherbal and Hiempsal, and an illegitimate son, Jugurtha. Micipsa divided his kingdom between these three sons. Jugurtha, however, {{turned on his}} brothers, killing Hiempsal and driving Adherbal out of Numidia. Adherbal fled to Rome for assistance, and initially Rome mediated {{a division of the}} country between the two brothers. Eventually, Jugurtha renewed his offensive, leading to a long and inconclusive war with Rome. He also bribed several Roman commanders, and at least two tribunes, before and during the war. His nemesis, Gaius Marius, a legate from a virtually unknown provincial family, returned from the war in Numidia and was elected consul in 107 BC over the objections of the aristocratic senators. Marius invaded Numidia and brought the war <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> end, capturing Jugurtha in the process. The apparent incompetence of the Senate, and the brilliance of Marius, had been put on full display. The populares party took full advantage of this opportunity by allying itself with Marius.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 the keeper's {{quarters}} {{went through}} major repairs, replacing the original slate tiles with terracotta ones. This was followed with {{the replacement of}} the steps handrail in 1903. A 1903 report criticised the light, saying that the red flashes were only visible for half the distance of the white ones, confusing navigators. This led to a recommendation to remove the red shades, resulting in a new characteristic of one white flash every minute, and later to upgrade the light <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> group flashing dioptric light. Another report in 1912 stated that the station was in good condition, but criticised the low power of the light, and recommended withdrawing two of the keepers. However, all of these recommendations were not acted upon until 1 July 1922, when the apparatus was upgraded to a revolving Dalén light with an intensity of 20,000cd, and the manning reduced to two keepers. In 1932 the original gallery handrails, also supplied by H Wilkins & Co., were replaced with steel gas pipe and mild steel rods.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, Joseph M. Wilson, {{a lawyer}} by trade with degrees from Amherst College (B.A.), the University of Pennsylvania (M.A.), the University of Southern California (J.D.), and Harvard University (M.A.), was {{appointed}} principal {{and with the}} support of alumni and parents, was able to secure more funding and additional autonomy from the Baltimore City Public Schools. Wilson introduced the IB Diploma Program in 1998. The turnaround Wilson orchestrated led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> resurgence and restoration of the school's academic reputation. Enrollment, student performance, {{and the quality of the}} colleges and universities to which graduates matriculated improved, which attracted critical acclaim from education professionals and international media attention. In 2000, City College was recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School, the highest academic honor bestowed by the U.S. Department of Education. In 2001, the Toronto National Post reported on its search for the perfect high school in Great Britain, the United States, and Canada. One subject of the prominent feature article was Baltimore City College and its turnaround.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, 2011, a broad upper trough dropped southward {{over the}} {{northwest}} Atlantic, supporting a cold front that extended westward across Bermuda to inland over Georgia. The front produced {{a large area}} of light showers to its north, with its westernmost component remaining quasi-stationary over northeastern Florida. On July 16, a surface low developed along the decaying boundary, just off the coast, generating an area of sporadic convection north of the Bahamas. Although a wind circulation was initially absent and surface pressures were relatively high, the low later became better organized under abating shear conditions. At 2100UTC on July17, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) declared it a tropical depression, after reconnaissance confirmed {{the presence of a}} closed circulation center about 100mi (160km) northwest of Great Abaco Island. It strengthened into Tropical Storm Bret just three hours later, owing <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> increase in winds and deep central convection.|$|E
5|$|Metalloproteinase {{activity}} causes hemorrhage and necrosis {{following a}} snake bite, {{a process which}} aids digestion. The activity of proteases, on the other hand, disrupts platelet and muscle function and damages cell membranes, and thus contributes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> death for the prey animal. The {{study found that the}} venoms of Crotalus fell into two categories; those that favored metalloproteinases (Type I) and those that favored proteases (Type II). The study stated that these functions were essentially mutually exclusive; venoms had been selected for based on either their toxicity or their tenderizing potential. The researchers also hypothesized that the reason for this dichotomy was that a venom high in neurotoxicity, such as a type II venom, kills an animal quickly, preventing the relatively slower acting metalloproteinase from digesting tissue.|$|E

5|$|Super Bowl XXV {{took place}} amidst a {{background}} of war and patriotism in front of 73,813 fans at Tampa Stadium, in Tampa, Florida. The Gulf War had begun {{less than two weeks}} previous and the nation rallied around the Super Bowl as a symbol of America. Adding to the patriotic feeling was Whitney Houston's stirring rendition of the national anthem, perhaps the greatest in Super Bowl history. The game itself was among the most competitive Super Bowls ever played. The Giants got off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> 3–0 lead. However, the Bills scored the next 12 points, on a field goal, a touchdown by backup running back Don Smith and a safety after Jeff Hostetler was sacked in the end zone by Bruce Smith. Down 12-3, the Giants ran a drive that took nearly eight minutes and culminated in a 14-yard touchdown pass from Hostetler to Stephen Baker, making the score 12–10 at halftime.|$|E

5|$|The game, {{like many}} {{previous}} meetings {{between the two}} teams, was dominated by defense. The Pacers got off <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> start, opening up a 20-point lead with seven minutes to go before halftime. The Pistons managed to cut into the lead, trailing by 16 points by halftime. The Pistons opened the third quarter with a 9–2 run, but the Pacers ended it with a buzzer-beating three-pointer and a layup from Jamaal Tinsley heading into the fourth quarter. Richard Hamilton and Lindsey Hunter started the last quarter with consecutive three-point field goals, as the Pistons cut into the lead again. But Stephen Jackson's back-to-back field goals pushed the lead back to 93–79 with 3:52 remaining, essentially putting the Pistons away. Despite the lopsided score {{near the end of}} the game, most key players on both teams remained in the game.|$|E
