50|$|The <b>thermopause</b> is the {{atmospheric}} boundary of Earth's energy system, {{located at the}} top of the thermosphere. The temperature of the <b>thermopause</b> could range up to absolute zero to 987.548 C.|$|E
50|$|The {{thermosphere}} is {{the second-highest}} layer of Earth's atmosphere. It {{extends from the}} mesopause (which separates it from the mesosphere) {{at an altitude of}} about 80 km up to the <b>thermopause</b> at an altitude range of 500 - 1000 km. The height of the <b>thermopause</b> varies considerably due to changes in solar activity. Because the <b>thermopause</b> lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere, it is also referred to as the exobase. The lower part of the thermosphere, from 80 to 550 km above Earth's surface, contains the ionosphere.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{agreed-upon}} end to {{the upper}} atmosphere, but rather incrementally thinner air from the stratosphere (~50 km), mesosphere (~85 km), and thermosphere (~690 km) up to the exosphere (~10,000) (see also <b>thermopause).</b> For example, a meteoroid can become a meteor {{at an altitude of}} 85-120 km above the Earth.|$|E
50|$|Below this, the {{atmosphere}} is defined to be active on the insolation received, due to the increased presence of heavier gases such as monatomic oxygen. The solar constant is thus expressed at the <b>thermopause.</b> Beyond (above) this, the exosphere describes the thinnest remainder of atmospheric particles with large mean free path, mostly hydrogen and helium. As a limit for the exosphere this boundary is also called exobase.|$|E
40|$|Diurnal density {{variations}} of the upper atmosphere are described. Temperature distribution above the <b>thermopause</b> were mapped and extremes of temperature variation over the 11 -year solar cycle were determined. Day and nigth density profiles in the upper atmosphere at sunspot minimum {{and at a time}} of exceptionally high solar activity are presented...|$|E
40|$|We outline for {{the first}} time the effect of such nonthermal line {{broadening}} processes as turbulence, random waves, convection, etc., on the shape and intensity of the H Ly-alpha line resonance scattered from the atmosphere of Jupiter. We show how a nonthermal velocity field confined to the bulge region, in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, may account for most of the H Ly-alpha bulge features. Both the shape and the brightness of the Ly-alpha line from the bulge region as reported by the IUE instrument and the Voyager UV Spectrometer can be recovered assuming resonant scattering with a total atomic hydrogen of about 4 x 10 exp 17 /sq cm, and a nonthermal component H of about 2 x 10 exp 15 /sq cm above the <b>thermopause...</b>|$|E
