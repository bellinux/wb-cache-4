40|$|Abstract. Wireless Sensor Networks are {{extremely}} vulnerable against {{any kind of}} internal or external attacks, due to several factors such as resource-constrained nodes and lack of <b>tamper-resistant</b> <b>packages.</b> As a result, security must {{be an important factor}} to have in mind when designing the infrastructure and protocols of sensor networks. In this paper we survey the “state-of-the-art ” security issues in sensor networks and highlight the open areas of research. ...|$|R
40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks(WSN) usually {{consists}} {{of a large number}} of tiny sensors with limited computation ca-pacity, memory space and power resource. WSN's are extremely vulnerable against any kind of internal or external attacks, due to several factors such as resource constrained nodes and lack of <b>tamper-resistant</b> <b>packages.</b> To achieve security in wireless sensor networks, it is important to encrypt messages sent among sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a scheme called Modified Bloom's Scheme(MBS); it makes use of asymmetric matrices in place of symmetric matrices in order to establish secret keys between node pairs. In this proposed scheme, the network resilience against node capture is substantially improved. Â© 2009 IEEE...|$|R
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1982, a murderer added 65 milligrams of cyanide to some Tylenol {{capsules}} on store shelves, killing seven people, including three in one family. Johnson & Johnson recalled and destroyed 31 million capsules {{at a cost of}} $100 million. The affable CEO, James Burke, appeared in television ads and at news conferences informing consumers of the company's actions. <b>Tamper-resistant</b> <b>packaging</b> was rapidly introduced, and Tylenol sales swiftly bounced back to near pre-crisis levels.|$|E
50|$|As several HBS {{case studies}} point out, Tylenol was the country's best-selling {{over-the-counter}} pain reliever {{at the time}} of the poisonings, with 35 percent of the market-more than the next three brands combined. Yet within a year of the crisis, thanks to decisions by Burke and his team to recall millions of bottles and replace them in a matter of weeks with pioneering <b>tamper-resistant</b> <b>packaging</b> while keeping the media and public well informed, the product had regained 85 percent of its market share. By the mid-1980s, Tylenol had rebounded completely. The customer confidence and goodwill Johnson & Johnson had built up also enabled it to overcome another poisoning incident in 1986-an event that resulted in the replacement of capsules with caplets.|$|E
40|$|A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a {{collection}} of thousands of tiny sensor nodes having the capability of wireless communication, limited computation and sensing. These networks are vulnerable to internal and external attacks {{due to the lack of}} <b>tamper-resistant</b> <b>packaging</b> and the insecure nature of wireless communication channels. Since most of the existing routing protocols are application specific and hence do not satisfy the security constraints of wireless sensor networks. Whenever any device comes within the frequency range can get the access to the transmitting data and may affect the transmission. In this paper, we simulated the concept of frequency hopping and proved it a better approach to provide security in WSN. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Counterfeit {{products}} {{have been a}} major concern in global market. There are many procedures for preventing the counterfeiting of goods, such as holograms, <b>tamper-resistant</b> <b>packaging</b> etc. However, there is still a rising trend in counterfeit goods. With the emergence of RFID systems, supply chain man-agement is able to detect counterfeit products relatively easily. Existing techniques generally involve a centralized database and can only be implemented in an online scenario. This deprives the individual customers of using any authentication mechanism while making purchases due to the infeasibility of accessing a central database. In this paper, we analyze a recently published semi-offline scheme proposed by Alex et al. We identify limita-tions and weaknesses in this scheme and suggest solutions. We modify the framework to remove the main weakness and extend it to the consumer level so that a consumer can determine the legitimacy of a product. This involves Near Field Communication technology (NFC) which is now widely available in cell phones – the consumer’s cell phone acts as an RFID reader and detects counterfeit products. Our solution is completely offline as it does not require a central database for product authentication. It is based on Public Key Cryptography (PKC) and a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). It offers dual layer authentication mechanisms to customers, visual and cryptographic, without accessing the supplier’s database. The main beneficiary of the proposed framework is the consumer who uses the Internet for online shopping and can authenticate a product reliably after delivery. Our scheme is stand-alone and does not require the transfer of any secret values from a centralized authority...|$|E
