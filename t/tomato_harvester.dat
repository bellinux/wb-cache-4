5000|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, California’s tomato {{industry}} was threatened {{due to a}} lack of laborers to harvest the crops. In response, the UC Davis Agricultural Engineering department developed a mechanical <b>tomato</b> <b>harvester.</b> Unfortunately, the machine crushed the tomatoes. The University of California-Davis's Vegetable Crops department, led by Hanna, came to the rescue by breeding a firmer-skinned tomato.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{paper was}} {{conducted}} to solve the low machining accuracy of eccentric parts and thin-walled parts on <b>tomato</b> <b>harvester,</b> reduce the machining steps of thin-walled parts and eccentric parts, and promote the machining accuracy and labor productivity, a special fixture was designed. High concentricity machining was applied based on adjusting the fixture, and manufacturing workpiece didn’t need to dismount, thus the concentricity and machining accuracy of manufacturing workpiece can be achieved. It’s beneficial to improve productivity and production quality...|$|E
40|$|Mechanization in such {{countries}} as the United States and Canada has dramatically reshaped the agricultural landscape {{since the time}} of early settlement. The introduction of new technologies—such as the mechanical <b>tomato</b> <b>harvester,</b> grain combines, and large four-wheel-drive tractors—has resulted in an increase in both farm size and agricultural output, a decrease in the demand for farm labor, and the demise of rural communities. The adoption of new technologies results in losers and gainers; a debate centers around whether losers should be compensated. Agricultural labor includes workers that are employed in packing and processing plants in which wages are generally low (somewhere near the minimum wage) and working conditions are less than desirable...|$|E
50|$|In 2005, {{after the}} CIW boycotted Taco Bell {{for almost four}} years, the company agreed to sign a Fair Food Agreement, {{committing}} the company to pay a “penny more per pound” on its tomatoes, to be passed on as wage bonus to <b>tomato</b> <b>harvesters,</b> {{and to work with}} CIW to improve conditions in the fields. College campuses were a major impetus for this agreement; twenty-two colleges banned Taco Bell from operating. The CIW then targeted McDonald’s for two years; in 2007, McDonald's signed a Fair Food Agreement with CIW. Other fast-food chains and food retailers followed suit.|$|R
40|$|The {{harvesting}} {{of processing}} tomatoes is fully mechanised {{and it is}} well known that during harvest, fruits are subjected to mechanical stress causing physical injuries, including skin punctures, pulp and cell rupture. Some wireless sensors have been used for research during recent years with the main purpose of reducing the quality loss of tomato fruits by diminishing the number and intensity of impacts. In this study the IRD (impact recorder device) sensor was used to evaluate several <b>tomato</b> <b>harvesters.</b> The specific objectives were to evaluate the impacts during mechanical harvest using a wireless sensor, to determine the critical points at which damage occurs, and to assess the damage levels. Samples were taken to determine the influence of mechanical harvest on texture, or on other quality characteristics including percentage of damages. From the obtained data it has been possible to identify the critical points where the damages were produced for each one of the five harvester models examined. The highest risk of damage was in zone 1 of the combine—from the cutting system to the colour selector—because the impacts were of higher intensity and hit less absorbing surfaces than in zone 2 —from colour selector to discharge. The shaker and exit from the shaker are two of the harvester elements that registered the highest intensity impacts. By adjusting, in a specific way each harvester model, using the results from this research, it has been possible to reduce the tomato damage percentage from 20 to 29 % to less than 10 %. The funding of this work has been covered by: Navarre Government Concerted Project: "Damage Determination in Processing <b>Tomato</b> <b>Harvesters</b> in Navarre", and CICYT Project AGL 2000 - 081...|$|R
5000|$|Between 1995 and 2000, the CIW {{organized}} {{several major}} actions to protest declining real wages for <b>tomato</b> <b>harvesters,</b> {{as well as}} frequent violence from supervisors towards field workers. This period included community-wide work stoppages in 1995, 1997 and 1999; a 30-day hunger strike undertaken by six members in 1998; and a 230-mile march from Ft. Myers to Orlando in 2000. By 1998, these protests [...] "won industry-wide raises of 13-25% (translating into several million dollars annually for the community in increased wages).... Those raises brought the tomato picking piece rate back to pre-1980 levels (the piece rate had fallen below those levels {{over the course of}} the intervening two decades), but wages remained below poverty level and continuing improvement was slow in coming." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} provide a {{theoretical}} basis for the research on processing <b>tomato</b> <b>harvester,</b> three kinds of processing tomatoes which were largely cultivated and suitable for mechanization harvest in Xinjiang location of China were sampled, and after measuring the red-ripe fruit weight, fruit transverse and longitudinal diameter, the regression equations about the fruit weight and the fruit transverse diameter, fruit longitudinal diameter, fruit shape were established, and the fruit-stem separation force test on the samples was carried out, so the regression equations about the processing tomato fruit-stem separation force and the fruit weight were established. Finally, the mathematical models about fruit-stem separation force and fruit shape of processing tomatoes were built...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a load:yield monitor for mounting on a processing <b>tomato</b> <b>harvester.</b> A continuous mass flow-ype yield-ensing device equipped with load cells and a vibration-resistant angle transducer along with a differential global position-ing system (DGPS) was developed to collect spatially variable yield data in real-time. Both analog and digital signal processing were employed to maximise the accuracy of data acquisition. The yield monitoring system was calibrated, validated, and tested during the 1997 harvesting season. The coefficient of determination, r 2, between the actual fruit weight and the yield monitor prediction was 0. 997. The system was then used to measure yield variability and produce yield maps. There were significant spatial variations in processing tomato yield. The lowest 20 % yielding area within a field produced less than half the tomatoes compared to the highest 20 % yielding area within the same field. © 1999 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Abstract. Fruit-vine {{separation}} {{devices of}} processing tomato {{are being used}} for self-propelled <b>tomato</b> <b>harvesters,</b> while the traditional eccentric block-type processing tomato fruit-vine separation devices are structurally complex and requiring the assembly of high precision. In order to improve the fruit-vine vibration separation system, {{the parameters of the}} operating conditions of 4 FZ- 30 self-propelled processing tomato harvest machine eccentric separation devices as well as other models with hydraulic system {{both at home and abroad}} have been analyzed, meanwhile the full hydraulic vibration system for the tomato processing separation of the fruit-vine have been studied and designed. The result show that this hydraulic system can match the control system and work normally and reliably, which has laid the theoretical foundation for the improvement of devices of the tomato processing fruit-vine separation...|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} of different methods developed and tested for material feed rate measurement during {{the work of}} harvesting machines is done. Many systems are known and just commercially used for grain flow measurement during the grain harvest by combine harvesters. The errors and their sources during the work of these systems described by many authors are discussed. The yield measurement methods are under developing for other harvesting machines, e. g. forage harvesters, mowing machines, potato, sugar beet, cotton and <b>tomato</b> <b>harvesters</b> etc. The function principles of systems based on weighing trailers or round balers are described as well. Two methods of the mowing machine material feed rate measurement were developed and tested. The measurements carried out proved that a very good linear relationship existed between the conditioner's power input, output frequency of the apparatus measuring impact force {{by means of the}} impact plate, and material feed rate through the mowing machine. The calculated R-Squared values were about 0, 95. The impact of materials and conditions changes on mowing machine material feed rate measurement accuracy was measured under laboratory conditions as well. It was evident from statistical evaluation that changing crop variety, crop maturity and intensity of conditioning can have statistically significant influence on the measurement based on torque-meter. For impact plate measurement it was find out that {{it is not possible to}} determine statistically the influence of testing factors from our measurements.
