5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves {{control all}} intrinsic {{muscles of the}} larynx except for the cricothyroid muscle. These muscles act to open, close, and adjust the tension of <b>the</b> <b>vocal</b> cords, and include the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, the only muscle to open <b>the</b> <b>vocal</b> cords. The nerves supply muscles {{on the same side}} of the body, with the exception of the interarytenoid muscle, which is innervated from both sides.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the piece <b>the</b> pitch of <b>vocals</b> and instruments moves up and down in harmony with <b>the</b> <b>vocals</b> handling <b>the</b> melody and the instruments accompanying, this is soon followed with the instruments changing to a lower pitch with <b>the</b> <b>vocals,</b> creating a darker timbre.|$|R
5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves supply sensation to {{the larynx}} below <b>the</b> <b>vocal</b> cords, gives cardiac branches {{to the deep}} cardiac plexus, and branches to the trachea, esophagus and the inferior constrictor muscles. The posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, the only muscles that can open <b>the</b> <b>vocal</b> cords, are innervated by this nerve.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{change to}} <b>the</b> <b>vocal</b> cast is the {{inclusion}} of actor Tony Todd {{as the voice of}} the Vortigaunts. He replaces Louis Gossett, Jr. in the role.

5|$|From the Greek {{word for}} pan pipes, σύριγξ, it is <b>the</b> <b>vocal</b> organ of birds. Located {{at the base}} of a bird's trachea, it {{produces}} sounds without <b>the</b> <b>vocal</b> folds of mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of some or all of the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the syrinx) and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This sets up a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the tension of the membranes and the bronchial openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx of mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time.|$|E
50|$|Like many garage rock bands, {{lead singer}} Sky Saxon's vocal style was {{influenced}} by <b>the</b> <b>vocals</b> of Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger, but have also received comparisons to <b>the</b> <b>vocals</b> of rockabilly acts such as Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> {{background}} <b>vocals</b> in <b>the</b> song were compressed using {{a compressor}} program called Waves Renaissance Compressor, {{which was used}} {{in order to create}} an enhanced polished effect. In an interview with Sound on Sound, mixing engineer Phil Tan, who carried out the audio mixing on [...] "SOS", explained that he compressed <b>the</b> background <b>vocals</b> because [...] "SOS" [...] is a [...] "high energy track", and he wanted <b>the</b> <b>vocals</b> to complement it. Tan also noted that <b>the</b> background <b>vocals</b> were pitch shifted to increase tonal quality and create an enhanced effect during the chorus. The pitch shifting consisted of making <b>the</b> left <b>vocals</b> flat and <b>the</b> right <b>vocals</b> sharp, with varying degrees of delay, and later mixing them together. When asked about the production of <b>the</b> lead <b>vocals,</b> Tan described <b>the</b> song as [...] "a pounding type of song, and the lyrics are a cry for help, so <b>the</b> <b>vocals</b> need to be 'in your face', almost aggressive," [...] and said that he wanted <b>the</b> <b>vocals</b> to remain constant. As with <b>the</b> background <b>vocals,</b> <b>the</b> lead <b>vocals</b> were compressed using the Waves Renaissance Compressor. Tan continued to note that the lack of reverb included on [...] "SOS" [...] was largely {{due to the fact that}} being an uptempo song, there was not a lot of room left to add anything else. Tan explained the production process of sampling [...] "Tainted Love", as well as the changes which were made: ...|$|R
5000|$|During Necrophagist's {{extended}} downtime Sami {{spent his}} time recording and producing a solo album called [...] "The Burning Sun" [...] under the project name Radiance.

5|$|Lopez and Anderson-Lopez's piano-vocal {{scores for}} the songs along with <b>the</b> <b>vocal</b> tracks were sent to Salem, Oregon-based Dave Metzger for {{arrangement}} and orchestration; Metzger also orchestrated {{a significant portion of}} Beck's score.|$|E
5|$|The IRIS {{original}} soundtrack {{was released}} as a 16-track album on November 13, 2009, with music composed by Yi Dong-jun and Choe Seong-gwon.

50|$|The {{challenge}} of the second live-challenge show was the emphasis on <b>the</b> <b>vocals,</b> meaning each performance featured a break to put focus on <b>the</b> contestants' <b>vocal</b> performance.|$|R
50|$|The music also {{gradually}} builds, at {{the beginning}} the guitar is just picking the strings and <b>the</b> <b>vocals</b> are overpowering it a little. As the song progresses <b>the</b> <b>vocals</b> stay <b>the</b> same and the instruments build, first the low timbre of the Bass then drums come in subito (suddenly).|$|R

5|$|The lungs {{also play}} {{a pivotal role in}} speech by {{providing}} air and airflow for the creation of vocal sounds. Lungs also provide the airflow that enables the expression of many emotions such as sighing, yawning, sobbing, laughing in humans and <b>the</b> <b>vocal</b> sounds in other animals.|$|E
5|$|The nerves {{also carry}} sensory {{information}} from the mucous membranes of the larynx below the lower surface of <b>the</b> <b>vocal</b> fold, as well as sensory, secretory and motor fibres to the cervical segments of the esophagus and the trachea.|$|E
50|$|First {{pressings}} of {{this album}} on vinyl had turquoise labels in mono only. Second pressings had the Capitol dome logo {{on the left}} side in both mono (Capitol T-914) and stereo (Capitol ST-914). Original Capitol stereo issues had <b>the</b> <b>vocals</b> out-of-phase, so playing them in mono caused <b>the</b> <b>vocals</b> to disappear.|$|R
5000|$|Richard Carpenter {{described}} <b>the</b> <b>vocals</b> on [...] "Calling Occupants" [...] as [...] "charming".

5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves may {{be injured}} {{as a result}} of trauma, during surgery, {{as a result of}} tumour spread, or due to other means. Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerves can result in a weakened voice (hoarseness) or loss of voice (aphonia) and cause problems in the respiratory tract. Injury to the nerve may paralyze the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle on the same side. This is the sole muscle responsible for opening <b>the</b> <b>vocal</b> cords, and paralysis may cause difficulty breathing (dyspnea) during physical activity. Injury to both the right and left nerve may result in more serious damage, such as the inability to speak. Additional problems may emerge during healing, as nerve fibres that re-anastamose may result in vocal cord motion impairment, uncoordinated movements of <b>the</b> <b>vocal</b> cord.|$|E
5|$|The song is {{composed}} {{in the key}} of E major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 173 beats per minute. <b>The</b> <b>vocal</b> range spans from E3 to B4.|$|E
