5|$|Anatomically, {{the human}} {{cerebellum}} has {{the appearance of}} a separate structure attached {{to the bottom of the}} brain, tucked underneath <b>the</b> <b>cerebral</b> hemispheres. Its cortical surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of <b>the</b> <b>cerebral</b> cortex. These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellar cortex is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly folded in the style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|Connecting the {{cerebellum}} {{to different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to <b>the</b> <b>cerebral</b> cortex, carrying efferent fibers via thalamic nuclei to upper motor neurons in <b>the</b> <b>cerebral</b> cortex. The fibers arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its input from the pons mainly from the pontine nuclei. The input to the pons is from <b>the</b> <b>cerebral</b> cortex and is relayed from the pontine nuclei via transverse pontine fibers to the cerebellum. The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent fibers are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs to {{different parts of}} the cerebellum. The inferior cerebellar peduncle receives input from afferent fibers from the vestibular nuclei, spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output from the inferior peduncle is via efferent fibers to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation. The whole of the cerebellum receives modulatory input from the inferior olivary nucleus via the inferior cerebellar peduncle.|$|E

40|$|Background Studies {{on blood}} flow {{velocity}} in <b>the</b> fetal middle <b>cerebral</b> artery have revealed signs of brain sparing in chronic hypoxia. These signs of brain sparing can {{disappear in the}} terminal case, but whether this applies to the whole brain or only parts of it is unknown. Methods Velocity waveforms of <b>the</b> middle <b>cerebral,</b> anterior cerebral and posterior cerebral arteries were recorded in 221 pregnancies complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertension. The presence of brain sparing (pulsatility index < 2 standard deviations) was noted and correlated to outcome of pregnancy, including emergency operative intervention and/or neonatal distress. Results Signs of brain sparing in <b>the</b> anterior <b>cerebral</b> artery were found in 90 fetuses, and in <b>the</b> middle <b>cerebral</b> and posterior cerebral arteries in 52 and 65, respectively. Signs of brain sparing in <b>the</b> anterior <b>cerebral</b> artery showed <b>the</b> strongest relationship to adverse perinatal outcome. <b>The</b> anterior <b>cerebral</b> artery was <b>the</b> only vessel in which signs of brain sparing were predictive of perinatal mortality. Conclusions Velocimetry of <b>the</b> anterior <b>cerebral</b> artery appears to be superior to that of <b>the</b> middle <b>cerebral</b> and posterior cerebral arteries {{as a means to}} predict adverse perinatal outcome. Anterior cerebral artery brain sparing may therefore be less transitory than sparing in <b>the</b> middle <b>cerebral</b> and posterior cerebral arteries, possibly suggesting that the frontal lobes are spared longer than the lateral and occipital regions of the fetal brain...|$|R
50|$|Two {{years after}} Juno {{defeated}} the Defiance, the Lifewave Galaxy and the Cy-Breed Empire had sworn their fealty to the Human Empire. Juno was then planning on performing a church mass and had Iconah {{seek out the}} Cy-breed leader, Nell Exer, and the others, Il and Infinity. Once all the guests were present, the Lapis attack the sector. Nell and Il flee while the human fend for themselves. Retreating to Infinity's base, they succeed in stopping the Lapis from attacking them. Iconah deduces that the ship Il gave them as a gift is filled with bloodair. Juno assigns Iconah to execute both Loodweeg and Il for this. After obtaining the severed heads of the fallen leaders, Iconah is then directed to <b>the</b> <b>Cerebrals.</b> <b>The</b> player has the choice of doing some tasks for <b>the</b> <b>Cerebrals</b> or get <b>the</b> information by force.

5|$|Fezf2 is a {{gene that}} is {{regulated}} by TBR1. Fezf2 expression is observed in layer V of <b>the</b> <b>cerebral</b> cortex. <b>The</b> <b>cerebral</b> cortex is constructed in six layers. Fezf2 expression is restricted to layer V for proper development and migration of neurons of the corticospinal tract, which is derived from layer V neurons and is involved in voluntary muscular control. Recent studies show that TBR1, expressed in layer VI, binds directly to the Fezf2 gene, preventing Fezf2 expression in layer VI. In this manner, TBR1 acts as a transcription repressor of Fezf2. Mutation of TBR1 results in Fezf2 expression in layer VI and malformation of the corticospinal tract. Abnormal activation of TBR1 in layer V eliminates corticospinal tract formation.|$|E
5|$|In most patients, {{the direct}} cause for <b>the</b> <b>cerebral</b> sinus {{thrombosis}} is not readily apparent. Identifying {{a source of}} infection is crucial; it is common practice to screen for various forms of thrombophilia (a propensity to form blood clots).|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1990s the {{function}} of the cerebellum was almost universally believed to be purely motor-related, but newer findings have brought that view into question. Functional imaging studies have shown cerebellar activation in relation to language, attention, and mental imagery; correlation studies have shown interactions between the cerebellum and non-motor areas of <b>the</b> <b>cerebral</b> cortex; and a variety of non-motor symptoms have been recognized in people with damage that appears to be confined to the cerebellum. In particular, the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome or Schmahmann's syndrome has been described in adults and children. Estimates based on functional mapping of the cerebellum using functional MRI suggest {{that more than half of}} the cerebellar cortex is interconnected with association zones of <b>the</b> <b>cerebral</b> cortex.|$|E

50|$|Amorphosynthesis, {{also called}} a hemi-sensory deficit, is a neuropsychological {{condition}} in which a patient experiences unilateral inattention to sensory input. This phenomenon is frequently associated with damage to <b>the</b> right <b>cerebral</b> hemisphere resulting in severe sensory deficits that are observed on the contralesional (left) side of the body. A right-sided deficit is less commonly observed and the effects are reported to be temporary and minor. Evidence suggests that <b>the</b> right <b>cerebral</b> hemisphere has a dominant role in attention and awareness to somatic sensations through ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation. In contrast, <b>the</b> left <b>cerebral</b> hemisphere is activated only by contralateral stimuli. Thus, {{the left and right}} cerebral hemispheres exhibit redundant processing to the right-side of the body and a lesion to <b>the</b> left <b>cerebral</b> hemisphere can be compensated by the ipsiversive processes of <b>the</b> right <b>cerebral</b> hemisphere. For this reason, right-sided amorphosynthesis is less often observed and is generally associated with bilateral lesions.|$|R
5|$|The cephalic {{molluscs}} {{have two}} pairs of main nerve cords organized around a number of paired ganglia, the visceral cords serving the internal organs and the pedal ones serving the foot.

However, relatively much larger expansions are known in the diplodocoid sauropods Dicraeosaurus and Diplodocus. In MCCM-HUE-8741, the small opening in the skull roof middle is responsible for a swelling on the endocast that is suggestive of a pineal system. It is in the exact position where the pineal gland is expected to have been, between the forebrain and the midbrain.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanism}} that {{is thought to}} have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain lipid peroxidation (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes endothelial cell and platelet release of nitric oxide, and the formation of oxygen free radicals including peroxynitrite. In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, capillary leakage, leukocyte sequestration, and apoptosis. The result of these effects is lipid peroxidation, which causes delayed reversible demyelinization of white matter in the central nervous system known as Grinker myelinopathy, which can lead to edema and necrosis within the brain. This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period. This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders. These disorders are typically related to damage to <b>the</b> <b>cerebral</b> white matter and basal ganglia. Hallmark pathological changes following poisoning are bilateral necrosis of the white matter, globus pallidus, cerebellum, hippocampus and <b>the</b> <b>cerebral</b> cortex.|$|E
5|$|The pallium is a {{layer of}} gray matter that lies {{on the surface of}} the {{forebrain}} and is the most complex and most recent evolutionary development of the brain as an organ. In reptiles and mammals, it is called <b>the</b> <b>cerebral</b> cortex. Multiple functions involve the pallium, including smell and spatial memory. In mammals, where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain, it takes over functions from many other brain areas. In many mammals, <b>the</b> <b>cerebral</b> cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci. The folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the amount of information that can be stored and processed.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} why spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) develop larger brain infarcts distal to an arterial occlusion than normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, we determined {{the surface and}} volume densities of <b>cerebral</b> capillaries, and <b>the</b> regional <b>cerebral</b> blood flow distal to an arterial occlusion in SHR and WKY rats. DESIGN: Occlusion of <b>the</b> middle <b>cerebral</b> artery was chosen because <b>the</b> middle <b>cerebral</b> artery territory is most commonly affected by cerebral infarcts in man. METHODS: Surface and volume densities of capillaries in the neocortex of <b>the</b> middle <b>cerebral</b> artery territory were measured by stereological techniques on histological sections. Fifteen minutes after ligation of <b>the</b> right middle <b>cerebral</b> artery, regional cerebral blood flow was measured autoradiographically by the [14 C]-iodoantipyrine method. RESULTS: The capillary density of the neocortex did not differ between the SHR and WKY rats. The blood flow was significantly lower within <b>the</b> middle <b>cerebral</b> artery territory in the SHR than in the WKY rats. CONCLUSIONS: The reduced blood flow distal to the occlusion in SHR is probably a consequence of structural adaptation of arterial resistance vessels, rather than being caused by reduced capillary density...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{discuss the}} {{expression}} {{and significance of}} angiostatin, vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase- 9 in the brain tissue of diabetic rats with ischemia reperfusion. MethodsA total of 60 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into the normal group, sham group, diabetic cerebral infarction group and single cerebral infarction group according to the random number table, with 15 rats in each group. The high sucrose diet and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin were performed for the modeling of diabetic rats, while the thread-occlusion method was employed to build <b>the</b> model of <b>cerebral</b> ischemia reperfusion. <b>The</b> immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect the expression of angiostatin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) in the brain tissue. ResultsThe expression of angiostatin after the reperfusion in the brain tissue of rats in <b>the</b> single <b>cerebral</b> infarction group and diabetic cerebral infarction group was increased 6  h after the reperfusion, reached to the peak on 1  d and then decreased gradually. The expression of angiostatin in <b>the</b> diabetic <b>cerebral</b> infarction group 6  h, 1  d, 3  d and 7  d after the reperfusion {{was significantly higher than}} that in <b>the</b> single <b>cerebral</b> infarction group (P <  0. 05). VEGF began to be increased 1  h after the reperfusion in <b>the</b> single <b>cerebral</b> infarction group and diabetic cerebral infarction group, reached to the peak at 6  h and then decreased gradually. The expression of VEGF in <b>the</b> diabetic <b>cerebral</b> infarction group at each time point after the reperfusion was significantly lower than that in <b>the</b> single <b>cerebral</b> infarction group (P <  0. 05). MMP- 9 began to be increased 1  h after the reperfusion in <b>the</b> single <b>cerebral</b> infarction group and diabetic cerebral infarction group, reached to the peak on 1  d and then decreased gradually. The expression of MMP- 9 in <b>the</b> diabetic <b>cerebral</b> infarction group at each time point after the reperfusion was significantly higher than that in <b>the</b> single <b>cerebral</b> infarction group (P <  0. 05). ConclusionsThe high glucose environment in which <b>the</b> diabetic <b>cerebral</b> infarction is occurred is to induce the formation of MMP- 9 at first and then activate and increase the expression of angiostatin. Afterwards, the expression of VEGF is inhibited, resulting in the poor angiogenesis after cerebral infarction, which thus makes the injury of brain tissue after cerebral infarction even worse than the non-diabetes mellitus...|$|R
