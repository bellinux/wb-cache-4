40|$|Managing {{ecosystems}} {{for multiple}} ecosystem services and balancing {{the well-being of}} diverse stakeholders involves different kinds of <b>trade-offs.</b> Often <b>trade-offs</b> involve noneconomic and difficult-to-evaluate values, such as cultural identity, employment, the well-being of poor people, or particular species or ecosystem structures. Although <b>trade-offs</b> {{need to be considered}} for successful environmental management, they are often overlooked in favor of win-wins. Management and policy decisions demand approaches that can explicitly acknowledge and evaluate diverse <b>trade-offs.</b> We identified a diversity of apparent <b>trade-offs</b> in a small-scale tropical fishery when ecological simulations were integrated with participatory assessments of social–ecological system structure and stakeholders’ well-being. Despite an apparent win-win between conservation and profitability at the aggregate scale, food production, employment, and well-being of marginalized stakeholders were differentially influenced by management decisions leading to <b>trade-offs.</b> Some of these <b>trade-offs</b> were suggested to be “taboo” <b>trade-offs</b> between morally incommensurable values, such as between profits and the well-being of marginalized women. These were not previously recognized as management issues. Stakeholders explored and deliberated over <b>trade-offs</b> supported by an interactive “toy model” representing key system <b>trade-offs,</b> alongside qualitative narrative scenarios of the future. The concept of taboo <b>trade-offs</b> suggests that psychological bias and social sensitivity may exclude key issues from decision making, which can result in policies that are difficult to implement. Our participatory modeling and scenarios approach has the potential to increase awareness of such <b>trade-offs,</b> promote discussion of what is acceptable, and potentially identify and reduce obstacles to management compliance...|$|R

5|$|However, {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} has been demonstrated in many cases. These are usually due to a shift in coral and zooxanthellae genotypes. These shifts in allele frequency have progressed toward more tolerant types of zooxanthellae. Scientists found that a certain scleractinian zooxanthella is becoming more common where sea temperature is high. Symbionts able to tolerate warmer water seem to photosynthesise more slowly, implying an evolutionary <b>trade-off.</b>|$|E
5|$|Males {{must first}} wait to sense a female’s pheromones {{before they can}} locate her. Before males engage in flight to find a female, they warm-up by {{shivering}} the major flight muscles to reach thoracic temperature optimal to sustain flight, around 26 degrees Celsius. The thermoregulatory shivering activities of males were measured as they were exposed to different sex-related olfactory cues. Males are found to heat up more quickly {{in the presence of}} a female pheromone and take-off at a lower thoracic temperature than males who are exposed to other chemical scents. Since heating up to the right temperature leads to better flight performance than flying immediately, there is a <b>trade-off</b> between sub-optimal flight performance and rapid onset of directed flight. Helicoverpa zea males exposed to an attractive pheromone blend thus spend less time shivering and increase their heating rate. Thermoregulatory behavior of unrestrained moths is associated with competition for access to females, showing the ecological <b>trade-off.</b>|$|E

40|$|Central to {{evolutionary}} theory {{is the idea}} that living organisms face phenotypic and/or genetic <b>trade-offs</b> when allocating resources to competing life-history demands, such as growth, survival, and reproduction. These <b>trade-offs</b> are increasingly considered to be crucial to further our understanding of cancer. First, evidences suggest that neoplastic cells, as any living entities subject to natural selection, are governed by <b>trade-offs</b> such as between survival and proliferation. Second, selection might also have shaped <b>trade-offs</b> at the organismal level, especially regarding protective mechanisms against cancer. Cancer can also emerge as a consequence of additional <b>trade-offs</b> in organisms (e. g., eco-immunological <b>trade-offs).</b> Here, we review the wide range of <b>trade-offs</b> that occur at different scales and their relevance for understanding cancer dynamics. We also discuss how acknowledging these phenomena, in light of human evolutionary history, may suggest new guidelines for preventive and therapeutic strategies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} nature and {{management}} of manufacturing <b>trade-offs.</b> It examines the properties and features of <b>trade-offs</b> {{in the context of}} manufacturing systems and the ways that operations management may deal with them. The need for such an investigation stems from (a) the increasing interest in <b>trade-offs,</b> (b) the implicit use of <b>trade-offs</b> in many recent popular operations literature, (c) the interest in the dynamic competencies literature and (d) the apparent lack of <b>trade-offs</b> methods or an overall framework. This study reflects the need to extend the <b>trade-offs</b> research from its present descriptive focus to an explanatory and hopefully more elucidating focus. This research is based on a number of case studies of manufacturing companies in Great Britain and Brazil. Data concerning their <b>trade-offs</b> were collected mainly through the examination of documents, observations of shop-floor activities and interviews with the systems' key operations managers. Following analysis identified the major data within and across the cases about the properties, features and management of <b>trade-offs.</b> This investigation suggests mainly that <b>trade-offs</b> between MSDs do exist; that their structure can be visualised as base, pivot and function; that they are contingent and dynamic; that their performance is different from their importance; that these depend on a range of external and internal factors; that one can improve <b>trade-offs</b> through alternative strategies and that flexibility may have a pivotal role in this process. The major original contributions of this explanatory, in-depth investigation are (a) the development of a <b>trade-offs</b> model that may be more accurate and useful than previous models in the literature; (b) the distinction between the performance and importance of trade-offs; (c) the taxonomy of <b>trade-offs</b> management strategies and (d) the identification of the role of flexibility in <b>trade-offs</b> management, with emphasis on the distinction between the ideas of flexibility and variety in that context...|$|R

5|$|Effects {{are not all}} negative; for example, {{wind farms}} produce {{renewable}} energy, helping to mitigate the single greatest threat to birds, climate change. But, especially if wind farms are poorly sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct or indirect habitat loss, and collisions. Well sited wind farms benefit birds; poorly sited ones can kill many birds in collisions. For example, at the Altamont Pass in California, the golden eagle has been reduced by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area. Thus, there is a <b>trade-off</b> in the siting of any wind farm.|$|E

However, variation in <b>trade-offs</b> is often determined at the molecular level, {{outside the scope of}} conventional ecological inquiry. In this study, we propose that understanding the intracellular basis for <b>trade-offs</b> in microbial systems can aid in predicting and interpreting patterns of diversity. First, we show how laboratory experiments and mathematical models have unveiled the hidden intracellular mechanisms underlying <b>trade-offs</b> key to microbial diversity: (i) metabolic and regulatory <b>trade-offs</b> in bacteria and yeast; (ii) life-history <b>trade-offs</b> in bacterial viruses. Next, we examine recent studies of marine microbes that have taken steps toward reconciling the molecular and the ecological views of <b>trade-offs,</b> despite the challenges in doing so in natural settings. Finally, we suggest avenues for research where mathematical modelling, experiments and studies of natural microbial communities provide a unique opportunity to integrate studies of diversity across multiple scales...|$|R

5|$|Some prey {{animals such as}} zebra {{are marked}} with high-contrast {{patterns}} which possibly help to confuse their predators, such as lions, during a chase. The bold stripes of a herd of running Zebra have been claimed {{make it difficult for}} predators to estimate the prey's speed and direction accurately, or to identify individual animals, giving the prey an improved chance of escape. Since dazzle patterns (such as the Zebra's stripes) make animals harder to catch when moving, but easier to detect when stationary, there is an evolutionary <b>trade-off</b> between dazzle and camouflage. Another theory is that the zebra's stripes could provide some protection from flies and biting insects.|$|E

Addressing <b>trade-offs</b> involves challenges of perception due to the dynamics of interdependence. We outline the challenges associated with addressing <b>trade-offs</b> and analyze knowledge coproduction as a practice that may contribute to tackling <b>trade-offs</b> in social-ecological systems. We discuss this through {{a case study in}} coastal Kenya in which an iterative knowledge coproduction process was facilitated to reveal social-ecological <b>trade-offs</b> in the face of ecological and socioeconomic change. Representatives of communities, government, and NGOs attended two integrative workshops in which methods derived from systems thinking, dialogue, participatory modeling, and scenarios were applied to encourage participants to engage and evaluate <b>trade-offs.</b> Based on process observation and interviews with participants and scientists, our analysis suggests that this process lead to increased appreciation of interdependences {{and the way in which}} <b>trade-offs</b> emerge from complex dynamics of interdependent factors. The process seemed to provoke a reflection of knowledge assumptions and narratives, and management goals for the social-ecological system. We also discuss how stakeholders link these insights to their practices...|$|R
40|$|During the {{development}} of Critical Embedded Systems (CES), quality attributes that are critical for them (e. g., correctness, security, etc.) must be guaranteed. However, this often leads to complex quality <b>trade-offs,</b> since non-critical qualities (e. g., reusability, understandability, etc.) may be compromised. In this study, we aim at empirically investigating the existence of quality <b>trade-offs,</b> on the implemented architecture, among versions of open source CESs, and compare them with those of systems from other application domains. The {{results of the study}} suggest that in CES, non-critical quality attributes are usually compromised in favor of critical quality attributes. On the contrary, we have not observed compromises of critical qualities in favor of non-critical ones in either CES or other application domains. Furthermore, quality <b>trade-offs</b> are more frequent among critical quality attributes, compared to <b>trade-offs</b> among non-critical quality attributes.

40|$|Tetlock’s sacred value {{protection}} model (SVPM) {{proposed that}} taboo <b>trade-offs</b> evoke a strong moral reaction {{in people who}} resist secular encroachments on their sacred values.

40|$|The {{mainstream}} {{of the literature}} on corporate sustainability follows the win-win paradigm, according to which economic, environmental and social sustainability aspects can be achieved simultaneously; indeed, corporate sustainability has often been defined by the intersection of these three areas. However, given the multi-faceted and complex nature of sustainable development, we argue that <b>trade-offs</b> and conflicts in corporate sustainability are the rule rather than the exception. Turning a blind eye to <b>trade-offs</b> thus results in a limited perspective on corporate contributions to sustainable development. In order to overcome this situation, we propose an initial framework for the analysis of <b>trade-offs</b> in corporate sustainability. By doing so, we pursue two aims.

40|$|Employment <b>trade-offs</b> {{are defined}} as the sacrifices that {{employees}} make in their job because of their family/dependent care responsibilities (Mennino & Brayfield, 2002). They represent an employee's decision to restrict their work responsibilities and devote their time and attention to their family when time and attention cannot be given to both their work and family responsibilities. Research on employment <b>trade-offs</b> has been primarily theoretical and qualitative, with the few empirical studies primarily examining demographic and attitudinal correlates to an employee's decision to participate in employment <b>trade-offs</b> without considering the mediating mechanisms between these variables and employment <b>trade-offs.</b> This dissertation extended the literature on employment <b>trade-offs</b> by examining family-work conflict as a mediator {{of the relationship between}} family and work domain variables and an employee's decision to engage in employment <b>trade-offs</b> among Federal government employees. This study also investigated the relationship of participating in employment <b>trade-offs</b> to workplace withdrawal behaviors, family-friendly benefit utilization, and turnover intentions. The family domain variables include dependent care responsibilities and childcare characteristics, while the work domain variables include organizational supports. The 2006 Federal Employee Dependent Care Survey (U. S. Office of Personnel Management, 2006) was analyzed and hypotheses were tested using both multiple regression and logistic regression analyses. The results showed that family-work conflict partially mediated the relationship between the variables of type of care responsibilities, perceived job schedule flexibility, childcare arrangement satisfaction, childcare quality, and childcare costs and employment <b>trade-offs.</b> Multigenerational caregiving responsibilities, number of dependents, and supervisor support were not related to family-work conflict and no mediation effect for family-work conflict was established between these variables and employment <b>trade-offs.</b> Analyses also found that family-work conflict was positively related to employment <b>trade-offs,</b> workplace withdrawal behaviors, and family-friendly benefit utilization. In addition, employment <b>trade-offs</b> were positively related to workplace withdrawal behaviors and family-friendly benefit utilization, suggesting that individuals do implement a variety of family adaptive strategies to manage competing work and family demands. Finally, employment <b>trade-offs</b> were found to be positively related to turnover intentions.

25|$|One {{option is}} to trade off an intact sexual {{function}} {{for the possibility of}} a prolonged life expectancy by not having curative treatment. The choice involves a <b>trade-off</b> so it is of central importance for the person and the physician to have access to information on established treatment benefits and side effects.

While six out of ten were willing to consider a <b>trade-off</b> between life expectancy and intact sexual function, given the present knowledge of treatment benefits for clinically localized prostate cancer, four out of ten stated that they would under all circumstances choose treatment irrespective of the risk for waning sexual function. Access to valid empirical information is crucial for such decision making. Key factors here are an individual’s feeling towards the illness, their emotional values and religious beliefs. A substantial proportion of people and physicians, experience stress in judging the <b>trade-off</b> between different treatment options and treatment side-effects which adds to the stress of cancer diagnosed, a situation made worse in that eight out of ten people with prostate cancer have no one to confide in except their spouse and one out of five live in total emotional isolation.|$|E
