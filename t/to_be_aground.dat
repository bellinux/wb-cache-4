2500|$|Following {{the night}} attack, Admiral Tōgō sent his subordinate, Vice Admiral Dewa Shigetō, with four cruisers on a {{reconnaissance}} mission at 08:00 {{to look into}} the Port Arthur anchorage and to assess the damage. By 09:00 Admiral Dewa was close enough to make out the Russian fleet through the morning mist. He observed 12 battleships and cruisers, three or four of which seemed to be badly listing or <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>aground.</b> The smaller vessels outside the harbor entrance were in apparent disarray. Dewa approached to about [...] of the harbor, but as no notice was taken of the Japanese ships, he was convinced that the night attack had successfully paralyzed the Russian fleet, and sped off to report to Admiral Tōgō.|$|E
60|$|From which point, or from which, {{she drove}} ashore, stern foremost; on which side, or on which, {{she passed the}} little Island in the bay, for ages {{henceforth}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>aground</b> certain yards outside her; these are rendered bootless questions by the darkness of that night and the darkness of death. Here she went down.|$|E
60|$|There did, indeed, seem {{no way of}} escape; for {{the driving}} masses of ice were {{grinding}} each other to powder in nearly every direction, and the brig only escaped instant destruction by being wedged between two pieces that held together from some unknown cause. Presently they were carried down toward a large berg that seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>aground,</b> for the loose ice was passing it swiftly. This was not the case, however. An undercurrent, far down {{in the depths of}} the sea, was acting on this berg, and preventing it from travelling with the ice that floated with the stream at the surface. In its passing, the mass of ice that held them struck one of the projecting tongues beneath the surface, and was split in two. The brig was at once set free. As they passed they might almost have leaped upon the berg. Captain Harvey saw and seized his opportunity.|$|E

60|$|After {{we were in}} a {{position}} to see all that might be going on immediately opposite, and for a mile or more down the river, we could make out the spars of several ships which appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at a stand-still, and at once the question <b>was</b> raised as <b>to</b> whether they <b>were</b> <b>aground</b> or at anchor.|$|R

50|$|For {{several months}} after {{his return to the}} Pelican, his wound meant that Ussher was on crutches, but despite this in January 1799 he volunteered to take Pelicans cutter and 12 men in an attack on another {{privateer}}, La Trompeuse, of 5 guns and about 70 men, lying in the Artibonite River, in the west of Santo Domingo. The privateer was boarded, and found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fast <b>aground,</b> so <b>was</b> destroyed. This was only one of more than 20 boat engagements in which Ussher was present while aboard the Pelican.|$|R
500|$|In 1909, {{following}} a {{collapse in the}} bank of the river, the canal company's chief engineer Mr A. J. Cullis called for old vessels <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run <b>aground</b> along {{the bank of the}} Severn, near Purton, to create a makeshift tidal erosion barrier to reinforce the narrow strip of land between the river and canal. Barges, trows and schooners were [...] "hulked" [...] at high tide, by towing them from the dock at Sharpness and releasing them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carried up the bank on the tide. Holes were then made in their hulls so that they filled with water, and over time silt has been laid down inside them.|$|R
50|$|By this time, Roebuck was in {{such bad}} {{condition}} that Dampier <b>was</b> forced <b>to</b> abandon his plan to examine {{the east coast of}} New Holland while less than a hundred miles from it. In danger of sinking, he attempted to make the return voyage to England, but the ship foundered at Ascension Island on 21 February 1701. While anchored offshore the ship began to take on more water and the carpenter could do nothing with the worm-eaten planking. As a result, the vessel had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run <b>aground.</b> Dampier's crew <b>was</b> marooned there for five weeks before being picked up on 3 April by an East Indiaman and returned home in August 1701.|$|R
500|$|The Charodeika {{class was}} a pair of {{monitors}} built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the late 1860s. They were designed by the British shipbuilder Charles Mitchell and built in Saint Petersburg. Both ships <b>were</b> assigned <b>to</b> the Baltic Fleet and had fairly uneventful careers mostly assigned to training units. [...] struck a rock in 1869 and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run <b>aground</b> lest she sink. They were reclassified as coast-defense ironclads in 1892 and Rusalka sank during a storm in the Gulf of Finland the next year with the loss of all hands. Her sister ship [...] continued in service until 1907 and was eventually scrapped in 1911–12. Rusalkas wreck was discovered in 2003 by an expedition sponsored by the Estonian Maritime Museum.|$|R
5|$|Rusalka, {{named after}} the mythological creature, was ordered on 25 January 1865 and {{construction}} began on 10 June at the Admiralty Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, although the formal keel-laying was not until 6 June 1866. She was launched on 12 September 1867 and completed in 1869 {{at the cost of}} 762,000 rubles. Construction was considerably delayed by late deliveries of drawings, material, and the death of her original builder. The ship struck an uncharted rock off the Finnish coast in June 1869 and damaged her bottom plating badly enough that she had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run <b>aground</b> <b>to</b> prevent her from sinking. Rusalka served her entire career with the Baltic Fleet and <b>was</b> assigned <b>to</b> the Artillery Training Detachment in March 1870. The ship had her boilers replaced in 1878 and 1891 and she was reclassified as a coast-defense ironclad on 13 February 1892.|$|R
50|$|By 5:00 that {{afternoon}} when the British withdrew for the night, {{two of the}} larger American vessels were severely damaged and a third had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run <b>aground,</b> burned, and abandoned. That night, Boston joined {{the remainder of the}} Americans in stealing away toward Crown Point to the south. The British discovered their flight {{on the morning of the}} 12th and struck out in pursuit. They did not finally catch the Americans until the morning of the 13th at a point just below Split Rock nearly halfway to their goal. A two-hour running fight ensued. Severely pressed, General Arnold took Congress and four of the gondolas into Buttonmold Bay on the eastern coast of the lake. There he unloaded small arms and destroyed the vessels by fire to prevent their capture. Boston was destroyed there on 13 October 1776.|$|R

500|$|On 10 May 1940, the Germans {{launched}} their invasion of France and the Low Countries. That day Keith {{and her sister}} [...] escorted the light cruisers [...] and [...] as they carried bullion from the Dutch port of IJmuiden to the United Kingdom for safe-keeping. On 12 May, {{she returned to the}} Hook of Holland in the Netherlands to evacuate Allied troops. After the destroyer [...] had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run <b>aground</b> on 19 May after she was damaged by German aircraft, she was scuttled by Keith. On 21 May, Keith was one of three destroyers that evacuated 468 civilians from France. Two days later the ship was in Boulogne-sur-Mer, loading British troops <b>to</b> <b>be</b> evacuated, when she was attacked by German troops. She was hit by a mortar bomb and machine gun fire that killed her captain and wounded many others. Keith sailed for the UK immediately afterwards.|$|R
500|$|During a gale on 18 December 1902 in Toulon, {{the small}} cargo liner [...] was blown onto the ram of Latouche-Tréville and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run <b>aground</b> lest she sink, {{although}} the cruiser was barely damaged in the incident.

In November 2015 it was reported that although it <b>was</b> still hoped <b>to</b> take her back to Sweden as a hotel ship she had in fact been sold for scrap and was being towed by the tug 'Kamarina' to the ship breaking yard of Alang. She arrived at Alang in tow of 'Kamarina' on November and has been anchored off the beach since awaiting permission <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run <b>aground</b> and for a high tide.

60|$|It {{became evident}} {{by and by}} that Harry had run in closer than was advisable, for there was a crash and the sloop {{suddenly}} stopped. Almost immediately afterward she lay over with her boom and most of her deck on one side in the water, while the tide, twisting her bows around, threatened to pour into her over the depressed coaming. As she had come up nearly head to wind, her mainsail thrashed furiously, jerking the boom {{up out of the}} sea every now and then and letting it splash in again, while the flapping jib seemed likely to snap off the head of her rattling mast. Loose ropes appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> flying everywhere and Frank clung stupidly to the coaming, uncertain what <b>to</b> do. They <b>were</b> <b>aground</b> unfortunately close <b>to</b> the schooner, and, he feared, within sight of the men on board her. Harry's voice, however, roused him to make an effort.|$|R
5|$|HMS Hardy was the {{flotilla}} {{leader for}} the H-class destroyers, built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France {{on both sides of}} the conflict. Hardy <b>was</b> transferred <b>to</b> Freetown, Sierra Leone, in October 1939 to hunt for German commerce raiders in the South Atlantic with Force K. After returning to the United Kingdom in early 1940, the ship became flagship of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla assigned to the Home Fleet. During the Norwegian campaign of 1940, Hardy participated in the First Battle of Narvik where she sank one German destroyer. As the British ships were withdrawing, they were discovered by two other German destroyers that so badly damaged Hardy that she had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run <b>aground</b> <b>to</b> stop her from sinking. The ship was lifted by a rising tide and eventually capsized.|$|R

50|$|Action {{continued}} in the Pacific, where the last notable torpedo bomber attack took place on 7 April 1945. Avengers from Yorktown were searching between Okinawa and Honshu for the Japanese battleship Yamato, which was escorted by cruisers and destroyers. Her mission <b>was</b> <b>to</b> run <b>aground</b> on Okinawa to provide floating heavy artillery for the defending troops in the expected Allied seaborne invasion. Her 18.1 inch guns could have created havoc among frail landing craft. Yamato and her sister the Musashi were the largest, most powerful battleships in the world.

60|$|Here, at last, Columbus {{had to give}} up {{his long}} and arduous {{struggle}} against the unremitting persecution of the elements. His ships, reduced to mere wrecks, could no longer keep the sea, and <b>were</b> ready <b>to</b> sink even in port. He ordered them, therefore, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run <b>aground,</b> within a bow-shot of the shore, and fastened together, side by side. They soon filled with water to the decks. Thatched cabins were then erected at the prow and stern for the accommodation of the crews, and the wreck was placed in the best possible state of defence. Thus castled in the sea, he trusted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> repel any sudden attack of the natives, {{and at the same time}} to keep his men from roving about the neighborhood and indulging in their usual excesses. No one <b>was</b> allowed <b>to</b> go on shore without especial license, and the utmost precaution <b>was</b> taken <b>to</b> prevent any offence being given to the Indians. Any exasperation of them might <b>be</b> fatal <b>to</b> the Spaniards in their present forlorn situation. A firebrand thrown into their wooden fortress might wrap it in flames, and leave them defenceless amidst hostile thousands.|$|R
50|$|On July 20 a {{tropical}} storm formed 150 miles southeast of Barbados.

The hurricane continued westward into the Caribbean Sea, becoming a strong Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mi/h km/h on July 22.Although the hurricane passed far {{to the south of}} Cuba, it caused several vessels to sink at Batabanó and brought heavy rain and flooding to the islands interior. Continuing westward, the hurricane passed over the eastern tip of the Yucatán Peninsula before first turning northward and then northeasterly. It made landfall on the Florida panhandle on the morning of July 27 as a Category 1 hurricane, with a wind speed of 85 mph (140 km/h). The storm continued northward, as {{a tropical}} storm, before dissipating late on July 28 near Augusta, Georgia. The storm and its remnants brought heavy rain to the Southeast, up to 8 inches in Cedar Keys and a maximum of 16.5 in at Union Point, Georgia. The cyclone caused extensive damage to the cotton crop throughout Georgia and Alabama.|$|R
