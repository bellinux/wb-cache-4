Racing on the Thames in London Oxford's boat was sent off first with the Cambridge boat following thirty seconds later. The 1936 race, held on The Isis, was the first to take place side by side. Later, the location alternated between the River Cam in Cambridge and The Isis, over a distance of about 1,000 yards. Unlike the men’s race, the women's continued in most years through the Second World War.|$|E

25|$|The Thames Discovery Programme is a {{community}} archaeology project, focusing on the archaeology of the River Thames on the <b>Tideway.</b> The Thames Discovery Programme (TDP) was launched in October 2008 and until September 2011, the project {{was supported by the}} National Lottery and a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The project is designed to communicate an understanding and informed enjoyment of the historic Thames to the widest possible audience, and to train and support members of the public (the Foreshore Recording and Observation Group or FROG) to monitor and record the archaeology of the foreshore during the lifetime of the project, and into the future.|$|E
25|$|Northwich Rowing Club {{was formed}} in 1875 in Northwich and {{continues}} to row on the River Weaver, producing Olympic and international rowers such as Matt Langridge. The club has its own boat and clubhouse located by The Crescent and holds three events every year, the Autumn Head in November, the Spring Head in April and the Regatta in May. In 2015 the club was the first rowing club from the north of England to win the Junior Coxed Quad Sculls at the Head of the River Fours on the <b>tideway</b> in London. Club crews have also competed in the Henley Royal Regatta, with a crew seeded in 2015 {{for the first time}} in the club's history. The club also has a large junior section taking rowers on from age 12.|$|E
25|$|Londinium grew {{up around}} the point on the River Thames narrow enough for the {{construction}} of a Roman bridge but still deep enough to handle the era's seagoing ships. Its placement on the <b>Tideway</b> permitted easier access for ships sailing upstream against the current. The remains of a massive pier base for such a bridge were found in 1981 close by the modern London Bridge. Some Claudian-era camp ditches have been discovered, but archaeological excavations undertaken since the 1970s by the Department of Urban Archaeology at the Museum of London (now MOLAS) have suggested the early settlement was largely the product of private enterprise. A timber drain by the side of the main Roman road excavated at No 1 Poultry has been dated by dendrochronology to 47, which is likely to be the foundation date.|$|E
25|$|Chitty rowed in the Oxford University crew in {{both the}} Boat Races that were run in 1849, the March race and the December race, each {{university}} winning once. He rowed in the Oxford University eight that won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta in 1850 {{when there was no}} Boat Race on the <b>Tideway.</b> He also rowed in the Oxford coxed four that won the Stewards' Challenge Cup at Henley and in the same year he won the Silver Goblets, the first year the coxless pair event was run under that name. His partner was James John Hornby and they beat Thomas Howard Fellows and C L Vaughan in the final. He repeated his success in the Grand Challenge Cup, and in the Silver Goblets in 1851 partnering James Aitken in the latter to beat John Erskine Clarke and C L Vaughan in the final. In 1852, he stroked the winning Oxford crew in the 1852 Boat Race. In 1853 he was in the Oxford four that won Stewards again and was playing cricket for I Zingari. For many years Chitty umpired the Boat Race.|$|E
500|$|CUWBC's trial, Twickenham racing against <b>Tideway,</b> {{took place}} in rough water and windy conditions. The race was also umpired by Rob Clegg with both boats getting away together.

500|$|On 16 March 2015, CUBC raced in {{two pieces}} along the <b>Tideway</b> against a Leander Club crew steered by Oxford's 2012 race cox Zoe De Toledo. [...] Cambridge {{won the first}} race, from the Boat Race start {{to the top of}} Chiswick Eyot, by two and a half lengths, and the second, between the Eyot and Mortlake by four lengths. [...] OUBC faced a crew from Molesey Boat Club in three races along the <b>Tideway</b> five days later. [...] Despite Imperial being given a head start in two of the three races, Oxford won all three pieces {{relatively}} easily. [...] The same day, Cambridge faced a Netherlands Eight in two races on the Thames. [...] The Light Blues easily won the first race, but finished the second level against [...] "experienced and accomplished opposition." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{total cost}} of the canal, from Worsley to Manchester and from Longford Bridge to the Mersey at Runcorn, was £220,000.

[...] Two locks up from the <b>tideway</b> was a small dry dock.|$|E
500|$|During {{preparation}} for the race, both crews were defeated on the Thames by the Lubrication Laboratory boat from Imperial College London. [...] Jim Railton, writing in The Times was not impressed: [...] "It has already been well established {{that there are no}} top class crews in this... Boat Race. [...] Each day on the <b>Tideway</b> {{in the final days of}} training have simply produced more negatives". [...] Cambridge also lost twice in short races against their reserve crew Goldie, whom Oxford had defeated at the Reading University Head of the River Race by eight seconds. [...] In appalling conditions, Cambridge won an interrupted race against a Barclays Bank crew. [...] Meanwhile, Oxford defeated a [...] "motley eight" [...] from <b>Tideway</b> Scullers School by four lengths along the full course. [...] Oxford's finishing coach was Daniel Topolski while Cambridge were guided by British Olympic rower David Jennens, and the race was umpired by Ran Laurie, who had rowed for Cambridge in the 1934, 1935 and 1936 races.|$|E
500|$|On 25 January 2015, a CUWBC crew raced {{against a}} crew from Newcastle University Boat Club along three {{sections}} of the Championship Course. [...] Cambridge won all three races with relative ease, and their boat club president Reid, rowing at number four, reflected {{that it had been}} [...] "a useful experience". [...] Cambridge raced against an [...] Imperial College Boat Club crew on 8 March over two {{sections of the}} <b>Tideway</b> course, first between the start and Hammersmith Bridge, before racing between the Mile Post and Chiswick Steps. [...] The first leg was declared to be too close to call by the umpire Simon Harris, while the second ended in a two-thirds length victory to the Light Blues. [...] OUWBC raced against Molesey Boat Club on 21 February 2015, in three stages on the <b>Tideway,</b> and comfortably won each race. [...] This was followed by a race against Imperial College Boat Club on 22 March over three sections of the Thames. [...] Imperial were waterlogged in the first piece, but Oxford easily won the second and third races.|$|E
500|$|During the {{build-up}} to the race, the two universities sent trial {{boats to}} race on 19 December 2013.

500|$|Writing in the Financial Times, Joseph Mallalieu {{noted that}} the Boat Race was subsidised by The Varsity Match every year. [...] Despite Oxford being [...] "firm favourites" [...] upon their arrival at the <b>Tideway,</b> Cambridge put in better {{performances}} in training, {{and by the time}} of the race were considered the favourites themselves. [...] The main race was umpired for the eighth and final time by the former Olympian Kenneth Payne who had rowed for Cambridge in the 1932 and 1934 races.|$|E
500|$|The 2016 Boat Races (also {{known as}} The Cancer Research UK Boat Races for the {{purposes}} of sponsorship) took place on 27 March 2016.

500|$|It was {{the first}} time in the history of The Boat Race that the three main races, the men's, women's and men's reserves', were held on the same day and on the same course along the <b>Tideway.</b> Prior to this year, the women's race which first took place in 1927, was usually held at the Henley Boat Races along the [...] course. [...] However, on at least two {{occasions}} in the interwar period, the women competed on the Thames between Chiswick and Kew. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the 2014 race by four lengths, with Cambridge leading 41–28 overall. For the third year, the men's race was sponsored by BNY Mellon while the women's race saw BNY Mellon's subsidiary Newton Investment Management as sponsors. It was part of the sponsorship deal with Newton Investment Management that mandated the women's race to be rowed on the same course and with the same funding as the men's race. According to their chief executive, Helena Morrissey, the company [...] "didn't just want a name on a shirt; [...] wanted to do something meaningful". The women's race was scheduled to take place at 4:50p.m., the men's reserves' race half an hour later and the men's race a further half-hour after that at 5:50p.m. The women's reserve race between Cambridge's Blondie and Oxford's Osiris took place on the <b>Tideway</b> for the first time, one day before the main races, at 4:05p.m.|$|E
500|$|Oxford's women won {{the first}} running of the Women's Boat Race on the <b>Tideway,</b> and the 70th overall, by {{six and a half}} lengths, to take the overall record in the event to 41–29 in Cambridge's favour. [...] Oxford also won the men's reserve race, with Isis winning by three lengths. In the main men's race, umpired by the six-time Blue Boris Rankov, Oxford won by six and a half lengths in a time of 17 minutes 34 seconds, taking the overall record in the event to 81–79 in Cambridge's favour.

500|$|CUWBC competed against Oxford Brookes University Boat Club {{along the}} <b>Tideway</b> on 31 January in a two-segment race.

[...] By Craven Cottage, Oxford Brookes were one third of a length ahead, but CUWBC drew level by Harrods, and led under Hammersmith Bridge by a length to take victory. [...] Oxford Brookes took Surrey for the second piece, {{starting}} at Chiswick Eyot. [...] A close start saw the umpire John Garrett warning the crews for encroaching into each other's water, ultimately culminating in a clash under Barnes Bridge as Cambridge were pulling away.

500|$|The Light Blues faced Oxford Brookes on the <b>Tideway</b> on 30 January, in a two-piece race. [...] Cambridge {{selected}} Surrey {{and were}} a length {{down by the}} Town Buoy. [...] At the first bend in the river by Craven Cottage, Oxford Brookes held a lead of nearly two lengths, but CUBC began to reduce the deficit. [...] By Hammersmith Bridge, the crews were nearly level and despite warnings from the umpire, Cambridge held their aggressive line to pass the finish line at Chiswick Eyot two lengths ahead. [...] In the second race, the crews rowed back from Chiswick Eyot to the Finish Post. [...] Although Oxford Brookes took a narrow lead, the Light Blues were ahead by Chiswick Pier and took clear water advantage to win by more than three lengths. Goldie had lost both races against an alternate Oxford Brookes crew earlier.|$|E
500|$|The Chiswick {{reach of}} the Thames is heavily used for {{competitive}} and recreational rowing. Championship Course from Mortlake to Putney runs past Chiswick Eyot and Duke's Meadows. The Boat Race is contested on the Championship Course on a flood tide (in other words from Putney to Mortlake) with Duke's Meadows a popular view-point for the closing stages of the race. The finishing post is just downstream of Chiswick Bridge. [...] Other important races such as the Head of the River Race race the reverse course, on an ebb tide. Chiswick is home to several clubs. The University of London Boat Club is based in its boathouse off Hartington Road, which also houses the clubs of many London colleges and teaching hospitals; recent members include Tim Foster, Gold medallist at the Sydney Olympics and Frances Houghton, World Champion in 2005, 2006 and 2007.

[...] A length ahead at the Mile Post, the Dark Blues were {{comfortable}} winners. [...] The second race, from Hammersmith to Barnes Bridge followed a similar pattern with OBUBC taking an early lead, and OUWBC pushing through for the win. [...] On 19 March, the Dark Blues took on a crew from Molesey in two races on the <b>Tideway.</b> [...] A tight start during which Winckless, the umpire, warned both crews, Molesey took a marginal lead. [...] OUWBC were back on level terms by the Mile Post and in calmer conditions, pushed away from Molesey to be a length up by Harrods.

[...] Oxford's attempts {{to reduce the deficit}} came to no avail and Molesey won by just short of one length.|$|E
500|$|Of Human Feelings {{received}} considerable acclaim {{from contemporary}} critics. In a review for Esquire, Gary Giddins hailed it as another landmark album from Coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics, {{partly because of}} compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless. In his opinion, the discordant keys radically transmuted conventional polyphony and {{would be the most}} challenging part for listeners, who he said should concentrate on Coleman's playing and [...] "let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center". Giddins also highlighted the melody of [...] "Sleep Talk", deeming it among the best of the saxophonist's career. Kofi Natambu from the Detroit Metro Times wrote that Coleman's synergetic approach displayed expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record [...] "a multi-tonal mosaic of great power, humor, color, wit, sensuality, compassion and tenderness". He found the songs inspirational, danceable, and encompassing developments in African-American music over the previous century. Robert Christgau found the music heartfelt and sophisticated in its exchange of rhythms and simple pieces of melody, writing in The Village Voice, [...] "the way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the <b>tideway</b> is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian." ...|$|E
2500|$|The crew {{went through}} Newbury in 4hrs 47mins {{and off the}} canal in 7hrs 29mins which had them back on {{schedule}} despite the halt. [...] By this stage the duo had picked up a multitude of supporters who were absolutely amazing and just kept encouraging and willing the crew on to beat that record. [...] Joining the River was great and with a good flow they picked up time {{all the way down}} completing the 54 miles in 6hrs (averaging 9mph) arriving at Teddington at 1920hrs for the <b>Tideway,</b> well up on schedule. The crew were able to pick up the pace spurred on by familiar sights and the welcome relief of the lights on the London Eye wheel.

2500|$|Cruising {{dinghies}} {{are designed}} for leisure and family sailing and are usually more stable than high performance dinghies. This is provided by a 'chined' (less rounded) hull, greater displacement, and proportionally smaller sail area.
