5|$|Depending on the {{authorized}} {{and actual}} sentence, upon demand, a criminal defendant {{has a right}} to trial by jury. <b>The</b> <b>defendant</b> does not have a right, conversely, to a bench trial without the consent of the prosecution. If <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> is charged with crimes for which the authorized sentence exceeds six months, whether in state or federal court, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> {{has a right to}} a jury. Further, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> has a right to a trial by jury if the actual sentence exceeds six months and the charged crime has no maximum authorized sentence (e.g. contempt of court).|$|E
5|$|A {{state may}} place {{the burden on}} <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> has to prove {{incompetence}} by the preponderance of the evidence, but the state cannot require <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> to prove incompetence by a higher standard, such as clear and convincing evidence. The right to competence cannot be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be knowing and voluntary. The state may involuntarily medicate <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> {{in order to make}} her competent for trial, but only after factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment (as opposed to civil confinement), that the medication is likely to result in competence, and that the medication is necessary to restore competence.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> and the State Attorney may {{appeal the}} decision; the appeal would {{be heard by}} a panel of the Prague High Court, {{consisting}} of three professional judges. A decision of second instance court is final and enforceable. Nevertheless, an extraordinary appeal may be lodged by <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> or the Supreme State Attorney, which would be heard by the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic in Brno; an extraordinary appeal may, however, rest only on issues of law and does not provide for full review of the case. After exhausting all of these remedies, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> may also lodge a petition to the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic. The petition may be based on allegation of violation of rights under the Czech Constitution and Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms.|$|E
2500|$|Gunns {{claims that}} <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> have sullied its {{reputation}} and {{caused it to}} lose jobs and profits. <b>The</b> <b>defendants</b> claim that they are protecting <b>the</b> environment. <b>The</b> <b>defendants</b> have become collectively known as the [...] "Gunns 20".|$|R
50|$|On 3 August 1974 <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> took {{an aerial}} {{photograph}} of the plaintiff's house. The plaintiff alleged that in taking the aerial photo, <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> had trespassed in the plaintiff's airspace. <b>The</b> <b>defendants</b> admitted taking <b>the</b> photo but claimed that they had taken it whilst flying over an adjoining property. <b>The</b> <b>defendants</b> also argued {{that if they had}} flown over the plaintiff's land, then they had the plaintiff's implied permission.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Defendants</b> did not {{promise to}} sell the stock {{to the highest bidder}} for cash. The Claimants sent a tender to <b>the</b> <b>Defendants</b> which, {{following}} <b>the</b> submission of all tenders, was the highest tender. <b>The</b> <b>Defendants</b> refused {{to sell the}} stock to the Claimants.|$|R
5|$|Defences to tracing are possible, {{particularly}} if returning the property would harm an innocent defendant, where the claimant has made false representations that <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> relied {{on to his}} detriment, or where the property has been transferred to an innocent third party without anything given to <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> in return that the claimant could recover in lieu.|$|E
5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test {{is whether or not the}} nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> is expected to avoid it.|$|E
5|$|Frank and the CCAF's {{position}} against coupon settlements {{was expressed}} in his written {{objection to the}} case in which he stated that they often do not provide meaningful compensation to class members, they often fail to disgorge ill-gotten gains from <b>the</b> <b>defendant,</b> and they often require class members to do future business with <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> {{in order to receive}} compensation.|$|E
50|$|His {{books include}} The Censorship of Books (1957), <b>The</b> <b>Defendant’s</b> Rights (1958), <b>The</b> Limits of Freedom (1959), The Supreme Court and Education (1960), The Constitutional Rights of Association (1963), Religion in American Public Law (1965), <b>The</b> <b>Defendant's</b> Rights Under English Law (1966), and <b>The</b> <b>Defendant's</b> Rights Today (1976).|$|R
50|$|The Court {{held that}} the {{plaintiff}} has a cause to maintain an action under Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 even though the copyright in the mural stands vested in <b>the</b> <b>defendants.</b> It was further held that <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> have not only violated the plaintiff's moral right of integrity in the mural but have also violated {{the integrity of the}} work in relation to the cultural heritage of the nation. The Court ordered <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> to return to the plaintiff the remnants of the mural permanently with no rights vesting with <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> henceforth and ordered <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> to pay damages with costs.|$|R
25|$|Second, {{since the}} {{subpoena}} {{was for the}} defendants' ISPs and not <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> themselves, <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> had no standing to quash the subpoena.|$|R
5|$|In some circumstances, {{the conduct}} of <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> can {{be a factor in}} {{determining}} the unreasonableness of their interference. In this situation the motives of <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> and the reasonableness of their conduct are the factors used to determine the unreasonableness of their actions. This {{is one of the few}} exceptions to the rule that malice is not relevant in tort law. In Christie v Davey, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> was deliberately creating a noise to frustrate the claimants; based on this, it was held that their actions were malicious, unreasonable, and amounted to a nuisance.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>defendant</b> {{may move}} to dismiss a {{criminal}} charge {{on the ground}} that he or she has been singled out for prosecution because of race, gender, religion, national origin, illegitimacy, or similar. In order to get discovery on a racial selective prosecution claim, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> must make the threshold showing that the government declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races. <b>The</b> <b>defendant</b> is not entitled to a presumption of selective prosecution based on data regarding the overall population of convicts.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{specific}} rules {{that apply to}} acts or omissions in homicide: an omission is criminal if <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> fails to prevent the avoidable death of the victim {{where he or she}} has the duty to do so and that <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> had the capacity to do so. As noted below, unlawful omissions have been excluded from unlawful act manslaughter. Like in other areas, a duty of care may now be owed, following R. v Evans, even where the dangerous situation which results in the victim's death was not caused by <b>the</b> <b>defendant.</b> Medical professionals may be relieved of their responsibility to sustain a patient's life, where terminating life support is dubiously legally classified as an omission.|$|E
50|$|The plaintiff, Step-Saver, sought {{contribution}} {{and compensation}} from <b>the</b> <b>defendants,</b> seeking declaratory judgment. In turn, <b>the</b> <b>defendants,</b> Wyse and TSL, moved for summary judgment.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>defendant's</b> {{course of}} conduct {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} 2 or more persons where the deaths are a probable consequence of <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> conduct.|$|R
5000|$|RICO also {{permits a}} private {{individual}} [...] "damaged {{in his business}} or property" [...] by a [...] "racketeer" [...] to file a civil suit. The plaintiff must prove {{the existence of an}} [...] "enterprise". <b>The</b> <b>defendant(s)</b> are not <b>the</b> enterprise; in other words, <b>the</b> <b>defendant(s)</b> and <b>the</b> enterprise are not one and the same. There must be one of four specified relationships between <b>the</b> <b>defendant(s)</b> and <b>the</b> enterprise: either <b>the</b> <b>defendant(s)</b> invested <b>the</b> proceeds of the pattern of racketeering activity into the enterprise (18 U.S.C. § 1962(a)); or <b>the</b> <b>defendant(s)</b> acquired or maintained an interest in, or control of, the enterprise through the pattern of racketeering activity (subsection (b)); or <b>the</b> <b>defendant(s)</b> conducted or participated in the affairs of the enterprise [...] "through" [...] the pattern of racketeering activity (subsection (c)); or <b>the</b> <b>defendant(s)</b> conspired to do one of the above (subsection (d)). In essence, the enterprise is either the 'prize,' 'instrument,' 'victim,' or 'perpetrator' of the racketeers. A civil RICO action can be filed in state or federal court.|$|R
5|$|Whether counsel are {{appointed}} or retained, the Clause protects {{the role of}} counsel and certain attributes of the attorney-client relationship. For example, the Clause requires that <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> be given time to consult with counsel and that counsel be given time to investigate the case pre-trial. And, the Clause also prohibits a state from barring a defendant from being cross-examined by counsel, or restricting {{the order in which}} <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> may be called as a witness. Further, the court may not prevent a defendant from consulting with her counsel during an overnight recess, even if the recess bisects direct- and cross-examination of <b>the</b> <b>defendant.</b> Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> has a right to have her counsel make a closing argument, even if a bench trial.|$|E
5|$|While the Self-Incrimination Clause {{primarily}} implicates the law {{of criminal}} investigations, the Clause also protects against self-incrimination that may occur at trial. Plainly, the Clause prevents the government from compelling <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> to testify against himself or herself at trial. Further, if <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> chooses to testify, the Clause prevents the state from requiring her to testify first. But, if <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> testifies, she cannot claim the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to cross-examination {{within the scope of}} the direct examination.|$|E
5|$|Also in Gooding, the Court {{approved}} of a hearsay exception for {{the statement of}} an agent of <b>the</b> <b>defendant,</b> holding that the doctrine {{should be the same}} in civil and criminal cases.|$|E
50|$|First, {{the stop}} of <b>the</b> <b>Defendants</b> was {{justified}} because the officer observed {{the occupants of}} the vehicle breaking the traffic laws. The seizure of <b>the</b> <b>Defendants</b> became proper when, upon approach and after hearing {{the description of the}} vehicle and <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> on <b>the</b> flash call, the officer had probable cause to make the arrest.|$|R
5000|$|In his dissent, Holmes {{wrote that}} {{although}} <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> pamphlet {{called for a}} cessation of weapons production, it had not violated the Act of May 16, 1918. He wrote that <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> {{did not have the}} requisite intent [...] "to cripple or hinder the United States in the prosecution of the war" [...] against Germany. <b>The</b> <b>defendants</b> were objecting only to the United States intervention in the Russian civil war. <b>The</b> <b>defendants</b> therefore lacked <b>the</b> specific intent to commit the crime of obstructing the war effort.|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{categories}} of affirmative defenses: justification and excuse. Justifications differ from excuses in that a successful justification will show <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> conduct was not wrong, whereas a successful excuse does not show <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> conduct was wrong. A successful excuse shows that, while <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> conduct was regrettable, this particular defendant will {{not be subject to}} punishment.|$|R
5|$|As simple {{ultra vires}} {{concerns}} the exact powers conferred upon government ministers and statutory bodies, statutory interpretation {{is arguably the}} most important exercise the courts need to engage in to determine the scope of powers laid out in the statute. Hence, the cases decided are fact-specific and depend upon each court's interpretation of the relevant statute, making success of the judicial review somewhat unpredictable. The UK case of Attorney General v. Fulham Corporation (1921), illustrates this concept. <b>The</b> <b>defendant</b> was a statutory body establishing washhouses and baths for residents who could not afford their own washing facilities. When it subsequently established a laundry service, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> was declared to have acted ultra vires since its statutory purpose was not to carry on a business. Even though the business was carried out at a substantial loss, the statute in question did not give <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> such a power to do so. Accordingly, the plaintiff was entitled to succeed.|$|E
5|$|Ashford v Thornton (1818) 106 ER 149 is an English law {{case in the}} Court of King's Bench that {{upheld the}} right of <b>the</b> <b>defendant,</b> on a private appeal from an {{acquittal}} for murder, to trial by battle.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{adopting}} a broad principle, the Court did not list any specific rules for how trial judges were to balance evidentiary {{standards and the}} right of <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> to secure witnesses in his or her favor.|$|E

50|$|United States v. Wilson, 610 F.3d 168 (2d Cir. 2010). Vacated <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> death {{sentences}} and remanded {{the case to}} the district court for resentencing. Jacobs held that statements made by the prosecution during the sentencing phase of the trial concerning <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> failure to plead guilty or to take the stand at trial violated <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, and in combination with the district court’s refusal to give a Carter no-adverse-inference jury instruction, violated <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> Fifth Amendment right not to testify at trial.|$|R
5|$|Due process {{prohibits the}} {{prosecution}} from knowingly using falsehood to convict <b>the</b> <b>defendant,</b> and requires reversal {{if there is}} a reasonable likelihood that the verdict was affectedwhether the falsehood is inculpatory or goes the credibility of a witness.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Stokes {{was accused}} of {{shooting}} and wounding Blackwell, his alleged abuser. Keeler testified for <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> in his trial that year. Stokes was acquitted of the felony.|$|E
5|$|In a 2013 federal bribery {{trial of}} a Board of Review analyst, in secret {{recordings}} by an undercover FBI informant from 2008, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> named Berrios as a recipient of bribes. Berrios was not accused of any wrongdoing.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>defendants</b> {{appealed to}} <b>the</b> Federal Circuit Court of Appeals and the Circuit Court waived {{one of the}} four issues {{presented}} by <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> and rejected <b>the</b> other three.|$|R
50|$|The lack of {{evidence}} {{and the fact that}} the civil action suit rulings were already passed did not deter the government from demanding that <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> surrender their rights. After 40 of <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> refused to obey the demand, several lawsuits were brought against them. The prosecution accused them of fraud and attempted to punish <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> by holding criminal trials.|$|R
