5|$|While {{still living}} in Mayagüez, Betances built a house {{for himself and his}} wife, which they only lived in for less than two years; the house, named the Casa de los Cinco Arcos (House of the Five Arches), still stands on the street that bears his name near <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>with</b> Luis Muñoz Rivera street, south of the city's center. Apparently a single, elderly man lives in the house to this day.|$|E
5|$|The sixth {{match was}} between Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Jeff Hardy. MVP quickly beat down Hardy and {{dominated}} {{early in the}} match. Hardy tried {{to come back with}} a mule kick from the corner, but MVP moved out of the way, leading Hardy to crash the mat face first. MVP controlled most of the match, until Hardy finally had some offense with a rope-aided corner dropkick in <b>the</b> <b>corner.</b> <b>With</b> the upper hand, Hardy performed a Swanton bomb on MVP, but MVP moved out of the way. MVP tried to perform a running big boot, but Hardy countered into a drop toe hold. The match ended with Hardy winning the match, after performing the Whisper in the Wind, a move performed by executing a backflip from the top turnbuckle, then spinning 180°, landing on a fallen opponent back-first.|$|E

5|$|When {{the rest}} of the office is told of Phyllis' injury, they take this as {{confirmation}} that the Cafe Disco is a bad idea and reprimand Michael for what happened to Phyllis. Disappointed and angry, Michael instructs Erin (Ellie Kemper) to close up the Cafe Disco. Kelly (Mindy Kaling) comes down with her and the two start dancing after Erin turns on the stereo. This catches the eye of two male employees from Vance Refrigeration, and soon Cafe Disco is full of both Dunder Mifflin employees and non-employees, much to Michael's delight. Oscar (Oscar Nunez) is mildly baffled that Erin actually invited one of her friends to come, as opposed to being ashamed of the office. Kelly and Andy (Ed Helms) get into a competitive dance-off with each other, and Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) makes out in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>with</b> his girlfriend Lynne (Lisa K. Wyatt).|$|E
5|$|Willet Street is a {{northbound}} {{one-way street}} comprising three blocks, {{stretching from the}} southeastern corner of the park at the intersection with Madison Avenue to the northeastern corner with State Street. All of Willett Street is in the historic district, including approximately 33 buildings. The street is entirely residential except for the First Presbyterian Church, built in 1883 on <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>with</b> State Street. Willett Street has many different styles including Queen Anne, Spanish Revival, Classical revival, Georgian, Romanesque, Italianate, and brownstones. Two larger apartment buildings, built in 1909 and 1927, break up the otherwise continuous row of older townhouses. One of those apartment buildings is the Willett, formerly the Wareham, a five-story building built in 1909 that spans 84–92 Willett Street. This building sits on a former site of the New York State Normal College, predecessor to the University at Albany, which burned in 1906. The oldest building on Willett to maintain its original facade, 22 Willett, was built in 1872. Nearby 28 Willett Street was the home of Martin Glynn, an owner {{and publisher of the}} Albany Times Union, a state comptroller, and the governor of New York from 1913 to 1914. Glynn was the first Catholic New York governor and the only longtime Albany resident to reach that position.|$|E

25|$|The {{house of}} Francisco I. Madero was at Liverpool 25 on <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>with</b> Berlin. The house was burned by Victoriano Huerta {{after he took}} power during the Decena Trágica in 1913. It is a narrow {{building}} with a pitched roof. There is a plaque on the buildings to commemorate the event.|$|E
50|$|On {{the north}} face of the podium, {{the first of the}} three levels, an opening covered by a slab leads to the funerary chamber. The mausoleum's other faces are {{decorated}} <b>with</b> false openings, <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>with</b> Aeolic pilasters.|$|R
50|$|The {{cabin was}} {{constructed}} with large hand-hewn heart of pine timbers. Using a broad axe, the timbers were hewn flat {{on both the}} exterior and the interior sides. The rectangular hewn timbers were typically in excess of seventeen-inches high and six-inches deep. They were stacked horizontally from just above the ground to a height of approximately 12 feet at {{the eve of the}} gabled roof, which ran north to south. On the east side, the eve was just below the top of the chimney. The timbers, some eighteen feet long, were joined at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>with</b> square notching. <b>The</b> sill timbers were supported at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>with</b> piers composed of stacked local rocks.|$|R

25|$|In August 2008 archaeologists {{from the}} Museum of London {{excavating}} in New Inn Broadway, Shoreditch, announced {{they had found}} {{the foundation of a}} polygonal structure they believed to be the remains of the north-eastern corner of The Theatre. The site is to be used to build a new theatre for the Tower Theatre Company. The Theatre and Shakespeare's involvement with it are commemorated by two plaques on 86–90 Curtain Road, the building at <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>with</b> New Inn Yard currently occupied by a Foxtons office. A surviving fragment of the original wall will be retained in the new theatre.|$|E
25|$|At its {{northern}} end is the village municipal building along Croton Avenue (New York State Route 133). It includes the bank building at <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>with</b> South Highland and then crosses {{the street to}} follow the rear line of all the properties on Main Street, the area traditionally known as the Crescent due to the curve resulting from the area's topography. This takes it to the southwest, crossing the aqueduct trailway. At Brandreth Street it veers westward to take in two properties on Central Avenue, then returns {{to take in the}} properties as far west as 119 Main Street.|$|E
25|$|The last {{significant}} {{buildings in}} the future district came to South Highland {{at the end of}} the decade. On the corner just south of the First Baptist Church, the Cynthard Building was erected in 1930 when the Romanesque Revival doctor's office that had replaced the Union Hotel in 1890, and a house to the south, were themselves demolished. The Cynthard was a single-story commercial block faced in terra cotta topped by a polychrome parapet. Also that year, the third and last bank building downtown was built at 13 Croton Avenue, <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>with</b> North Highland. The First National Bank, which had occupied the spot since 1880, moved into the district's only Art Deco building. It has an unusual neoclassical door surround.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} itself {{is composed of}} two sections, both four storeys in height with a flat roof, topped by a small flat-roofed structure that houses {{the upper end of}} the elevator shafts, with gardens taking up most of the space on the roofs. They are joined at the northwest corner of the lot, the southeast corner of the 51st Street intersection. It uses reinforced concrete flat slabs as its structural system. Paralleling 51st is a basically rectangular section five bays wide by 17 long. It is rounded at <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>with</b> Franklin, allowing 10 bays on that end. The main entrance portico curves between the two sections at ground level. Joined to that block on the west is an irregularly shaped 14-bay section whose west side begins to curve south halfway towards that end of the property.|$|E
25|$|The institutionally {{independent}} {{foundation of}} Paul Gerhardt Stift, located in Müllerstraße 58 at <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>with</b> Barfusstraße within the parochial boundaries, {{was run by}} deaconesses. The staff was divided in its allegiances to the German Christians and the Confessing Christians. While the institution's two chaplains, Pastor Urner and Pastor Hermann Wagner stuck with the Confessing Church, the matron deaconess sided with the German Christians. In the morning prayers led by her she included Adolf Hitler in her rogations, while the two pastors on their turn never did so. The deaconess leading the medical station of the Paul Gerhardt Stift, an active Confessing Christian in the neighbouring Nazareth Congregation, and other colleagues of her, continued to treat Jewish patients even after this was strictly forbidden in 1938 and therefore could not be invoiced to the health insurance anymore.|$|E
25|$|However the 1901 Census records W.M. Scott aged {{seven years}} {{with his parents}} and no {{siblings}} close to the tannery again at 20 Stonefield Terrace, in the All Souls parish of north Leeds, Yorkshire, and only four streets away from the Scotts' previous home in Clayfield Street. It was a four-room corner house in a back-to-back row on <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>with</b> Cambridge Road. This was a street of back-to-back houses, but is now a row of trees on a playing field. In the 1911 Census he was aged 17 years, he had no siblings {{and he was a}} lithographic artist apprentice, living with his parents in a back-to-back house at 49 Ganton Mount at Woodhouse, Leeds; the street is now rebuilt as modern houses. In 1911 his father was a journeyman joiner, and his mother a housewife. The 1911 census enumerator recorded that the house had eight rooms instead of the regular back-to-back four rooms, so no. 49 must have been a larger corner house.|$|E
50|$|Montbrun is a {{fine example}} of a 15th-century castle. In plan rectangular, it is flanked in <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>with</b> round towers and {{protected}} by water. Its narrow romanesque keep, 40 m square, close up against one of the towers, gives it a strange appearance.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} a {{traditional}} Charleston double house (i.e., four rooms per a floor at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>with</b> a central hall and staircase) but, unlike most, has matching two-story bay windows on the front façade, perhaps an early 19th-century alteration to an originally flat-faced building.|$|R
5000|$|Palazzo Bartolini Salimbeni is {{the first}} palace in Florence built {{according}} to the [...] "Roman" [...] Renaissance style: details new to the city included the portal with columns at the sides, the use of pilasters, the square windows with a triangular pediment and <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>with</b> rustication.|$|R
