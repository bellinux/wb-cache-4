30|$|To sum up, Internet finance {{influenced}} {{commercial banks}} through the following main channels, ranging from “upgrading technology level, improving work efficiency, reducing management cost” to “distributing current deposit, intensifying price competition and raising capital cost.” In this case, {{how do these}} two channels influence risk taking of commercial banks? Based on “principal-agent theory,” with management cost reduced and profit-making risen, commercial banks are less-motivated <b>to</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>risks</b> to depositors, thus reducing risk taking (Hellmann et al. 2000; Repullo 2004). And the “theory of competition fragility” indicated that the intense competition {{would lead to the}} decreased franchise value of bank, which would further encourage them to take more risks (Allen and Gale 2000). Hence, the preliminary conclusion were drawn—the effect of “reducing management cost” of Internet finance would lower the level of commercial bank’s risk taking, but the effect of “raising capital cost” would increase the level of commercial bank’s risk taking.|$|E

40|$|Risk {{management}} {{is essential in}} forest management planning. However, decision making with risk analysis is rarely done in forestry. This study presents {{an example of the}} application of conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) as a decision tool and optimizes the management planning problem from a risk perspective. Stochastic programming is used to solve the problem. The model contains four different types of risk using an assumed probability distribution and quantifies these risks, namely, inventory errors, growth model errors, price uncertainty and policy uncertainty. The results suggest that forest owners’ risk tolerance, i. e., their willingness and ability to assume risk determines to the greatest extent the return potential. When the expected first period income is maximized, the subsequent period always experiences a loss that is the greatest of the entire management horizon. The proportion of carbon subsidy in the first period is also the highest. With this model it is possible to hedge some risks or to use it as means to assess the amount of insurance to purchase in order <b>to</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>risks.</b> The use of CVaR in forest management planning {{can be seen as a}} useful tool to manage risk and to assist in the decision making process to assess forest owners’ willingness and ability to tolerate risks...|$|E
40|$|Application. Multi-locus {{analyses}} of allozymes indicate significant geographic variation in widespread forest trees. Under these conditions, allozymes {{in tandem with}} other traits, are useful {{in the development of}} breeding zones. Abstract. Early studies of allozyme variation in plant populations suggested that allelic frequencies in some loci vary by geography. Since then, the expectation that allozymes might be useful in describing geographic patterns has generally not been borne out by single locus analyses, except on the broadest scale. Multi-locus analyses reveal the converse: canonical correlation analysis of individual, uniformly-spaced genotypes describe statisti-tally-significant, complex patterns with geography. Multi-locus scores in four major species. Abies concolor, Pinus lambertiana, P. ponderosa, and Pseudotsuga menziesii, of the mixed conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada correlate 0. 40 or greater with the first canonical vector of a geographical trend surface equation. The different species follow similar patterns by latitude and elevation. In contrast with patterns in the Sierra Nevada, large-scale differentia-tion is weak (R * < 0. 20) among populations of Pseudotsuga menziesii in the Coast Ranges and Siskyou Mountains of northern California and southern Oregon, where differentiation may be local. For the purpose of forming zones, we subdivided scores of the first two to four canonical vectors into groups and plotted them as multidimensional contour intervals.

40|$|The global {{deregulation}} of financial markets has created new investment opportunities, {{which in turn}} require {{the development of new}} instruments to deal with the increased risks. Institutional investors who are actively engaged in industrial and emerging markets need to hedge their risks from these cross-border transactions. Agents in liberalized market economies who are exposed to volatile commodity price and interest rate changes require appropriate hedging products to deal with them. And the economic expansion in emerging economies demands that corporations find better ways to manage financial and commodity risks. The instruments that allow market participants to manage risk are known as derivatives because they represent contracts whose payoff at expiration is determined by the price of the underlying asset [...] a currency, an interest rate, a commodity, or a stock. Derivatives are traded in organized exchanges or over the counter by derivatives dealers. Since the mid- 1980 s the number of derivatives exchanges operating in both industrial and emerging-market economies has increased substantially. What benefits do these ex- changes provide to investors and to the home country? Are they a good idea? Emerging markets can capture important benefits, including the ability <b>to</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>risks,</b> enhance public information, and lower transaction costs, but the success of a derivatives exchange depends on the soundness of the foundations on which it is built, the structure that is adopted, and the products that are traded. ...|$|E

40|$|Self-defensive war uses {{violence}} <b>to</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>risks</b> from one’s {{own people}} to others. We argue that central questions in just war theory may fruitfully be analyzed as issues about {{the morality of}} risk transfer. That includes the jus ex bello question of when states are required to accept a ceasefire in an otherwise-just war. In particular, a “war on terror” that ups the risks to outsiders cannot continue until the risk of terrorism {{has been reduced to}} zero or near zero. Some degree of security risk is inevitable when coexisting with others in the international community, just as citizens within a state must accept some ineradicable degree of crime as a fact of community life. We define a conception of morally legitimate bearable risk by contrasting it with two alternatives, and argue that states must stop fighting when they have achieved that level. We call this requirement the Principle of Just Management of Military Risk. We also argue that states should avoid exaggerated emphasis on security risks over equivalent risks from other sources—the Principle of Minimum Consistency Toward Risks. This latter principle is not a moral requirement. Rather, it is a heuristic intended to correct against well-known fallacies of risk perception that may lead states to overemphasize security risks and wrongly export the costs of their security onto others. In conclusion, we suggest that states must invest in non-violent defensive means as a precondition for legitimately using force externally...|$|E

The survival function, also called the life-table, changes with calendar year, gender, smoking status and other demographic variables. An outstanding problem in risk estimation is the method of risk transfer between exposed populations and a second population where risks are to be estimated. Approaches used <b>to</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>risks</b> are based on: 1) Multiplicative risk transfer models -proportional to background disease rates. 2) Additive risk transfer model -risks independent of background rates. In addition, a Mixture model is often considered where the multiplicative and additive transfer assumptions are given weighted contributions. We studied {{the influence of the}} survival probability on the risk of exposure induced cancer and circulatory disease morbidity and mortality in the Multiplicative transfer model and the Mixture model. Risks for never-smokers (NS) compared to the average U. S. population are estimated to be reduced between 30 % and 60 % dependent on model assumptions. Lung cancer is the major contributor to the reduction for NS, with additional contributions from circulatory diseases and cancers of the stomach, liver, bladder, oral cavity, esophagus, colon, a portion of the solid cancer remainder, and leukemia. Greater improvements in risk estimates for NS s are possible, and would be dependent on improved understanding of risk transfer models, and elucidating the role of space radiation on the various stages of disease formation (e. g. initiation, promotion, and progression) ...|$|E
