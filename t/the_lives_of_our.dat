25|$|The {{fear of the}} end of {{life and}} its {{existence}} is in other words the fear of death. The fear of death ritualized <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> ancestors. These rituals were designed to reduce that fear; they helped collect the cultural ideas that we now have in the present. These rituals also helped preserve the cultural ideas. The results and methods of human existence had been changing {{at the same time that}} social formation was changing. One can say that the formation of communities happened because people lived in fear. The result of this fear forced people to unite to fight dangers together rather than fight alone.|$|E
25|$|Since 2003, the {{politics}} of war have been characterized by partisanship as the Republican and Democratic parties struggled for power in Washington. National efforts to date have been corrupted by partisan politics that have prevented us from devising effective, executable, supportable solutions. At times, these partisan struggles have led to political decisions that endangered <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> sons and daughters on the battlefield. The unmistakable message was that political power had a greater priority than our national security objectives. Overcoming this strategic failure {{is the first step}} toward achieving victory in Iraq without bipartisan cooperation we are doomed to fail. There is nothing going on in Washington that would give us hope.|$|E

500|$|The American War of Independence was the {{culmination}} of the civil and political American Revolution resulting from the American Enlightenment. Brought to a head over the lack of American representation in Parliament, which was seen as a denial of their rights as Englishmen and often popularly focused on direct taxes levied by Parliament on the colonies without their consent, the colonists resisted the imposition of direct rule after the Boston Tea Party. Creating self-governing provinces, they circumvented the British ruling apparatus in each colony by 1774. Armed conflict between British regulars and colonial militiamen broke out at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. After petitions to the Crown for intervention with Parliament were ignored, the rebel leaders were declared traitors by the Crown and a year of fighting ensued. The colonies declared their independence in July 1776, listing grievances against the British king and legislature while asking the support of the populace. Among George's other offences, the Declaration charged, [...] "He has abdicated Government here... He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> people." [...] The gilded equestrian statue of George III in New York was pulled down. The British captured the city in 1776, but lost Boston, and the grand strategic plan of invading from Canada and cutting off New England failed with the surrender of the British Lieutenant-General John Burgoyne at the Battle of Saratoga.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 November 2014, the Gwangju District Court found Captain Lee Jun-seok {{guilty of}} {{negligence}} {{and he was}} sentenced to 36 years' imprisonment. The judges said that he was clearly not the only person responsible for the tragedy and they accepted that his negligence did not amount to an intent to kill. The chief engineer of the ferry, identified by his surname Park, was found guilty of murder and jailed for 30 years. Thirteen other crew members were given jail sentences of up to 20 years on charges including abandonment and violating maritime law. Relatives of victims were distraught at the verdict, with some weeping. The AFP news agency reported that one woman screamed in the courtroom: [...] "It's not fair.

2500|$|Rabbi Wasserman {{was taken}} and murdered by Lithuanian {{collaborators}} on the 12th of Tammuz, 1941, in the Seventh Fort of Kaunas Fortress.

Therefore, we must repent now, immediately. There is not much time. We must {{keep in mind that}} we will be better offerings if we repent. In this way we will save <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> brethren overseas. Let no thought enter our minds, God forbid, which is abominable and which renders an offering unfit. We are now fulfilling the greatest mitzvah. With fire she (Jerusalem) was destroyed and with fire she will be rebuilt. The very fire which consumes our bodies will one day rebuild the Jewish people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eventually Clifford moved very close, with Johnson's tacit support, to {{the views}} McNamara held on Vietnam {{just before he}} left office—no further {{increases}} in U.S. troop levels, support for the bombing halt, and gradual disengagement from the conflict. By this time Clifford clearly disagreed with Secretary of State Dean Rusk, who believed, according to The Washington Post, [...] "that the war was being won by the allies" [...] and that it [...] "would be won if America had the will to win it." [...] He later recalled how he turned against the war: [...] "I found out that we couldn’t win the war with the limitations that we had, which I thought were correct limitations, and I thought all {{we were going to}} do was just waste <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> men and our treasure out in the jungles of North and South Vietnam." ...|$|E
