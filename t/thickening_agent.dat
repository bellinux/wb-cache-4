5|$|Onions are {{commonly}} chopped {{and used as}} an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes, and may {{also be used as}} a main ingredient in their own right, for example in French onion soup or onion chutney. They are versatile and can be baked, boiled, braised, grilled, fried, roasted, sautéed, or eaten raw in salads. Their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked, facilitating stuffing them, as in sogan-dolma. Onions are a staple in Indian cuisine, used as a <b>thickening</b> <b>agent</b> for curries and gravies. Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack. These are traditionally a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. Pickled onions form part of a British pub ploughman's lunch, usually served with cheese and ale. In North America, sliced onions are battered, deep-fried, and served as onion rings.|$|E

40|$|We {{carried out}} a {{questionnaire}} to hospital and senior citizen institution staff regarding commercial <b>thickening</b> <b>agents.</b> As a result we found that commercial <b>thickening</b> <b>agents</b> were used in almost all hospital and senior citizen institutions. The various medical staff (care workers, cooks, nurses, etc.) used commercial <b>thickening</b> <b>agents</b> added to liquid. We asked questions {{about the use of}} commercial thickening agents: which brand, method of measurement, a standard governing usage, most commonly used degree of viscosity, etc. The results differed among each hospital and senior citizen institution. In other words, they use commercial <b>thickening</b> <b>agents,</b> but there is no standards manual for staff to use.

25|$|A hand {{sanitizer}} or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent. In the late 1990s and {{early part of}} the 21st century, alcohol rub non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or {{hand sanitizer}}s) began to gain popularity. Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with a <b>thickening</b> <b>agent</b> such as Carbomer into a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin into a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to decrease the drying effect of the alcohol.|$|E

25|$|Tangerang Laksa (Indonesian: Laksa Tangerang) is a Chinese-Indonesian Peranakan laksa variant from Tangerang town, {{west from}} Jakarta, Indonesia.

50|$|<b>Thickening</b> <b>agents</b> {{are added}} to {{maintain}} the sparkling particles in suspension while in the bottle. A typical thickener is stearalkonium hectorite. <b>Thickening</b> <b>agents</b> exhibit thixotropy, their solutions are viscous when still but free flowing when agitated. This duality is convenient for easily applying the freshly shaken mixture to give a film that quickly rigidifies.|$|R

50|$|<b>Thickening</b> <b>agents,</b> or thickeners, are {{substances}} which, when {{added to}} an aqueous mixture, increase its viscosity without substantially modifying its other properties, such as taste. They provide body, increase stability, and improve suspension of added ingredients. <b>Thickening</b> <b>agents</b> {{are often used}} as food additives and in cosmetics and personal hygiene products. Some <b>thickening</b> <b>agents</b> are gelling agents, forming a gel. The agents are materials used to thicken and stabilize liquid solutions, emulsions, and suspensions. They dissolve in the liquid phase as a colloid mixture that forms a weakly cohesive internal structure. Food thickeners frequently are based on either polysaccharides (starches, vegetable gums, and pectin), or proteins.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} adding <b>thickening</b> <b>agents</b> on the {{penetration}} of a sunscreen benzophenone- 3 through epidermal and a high-density polyethylene membrane was studied using both very thick (infinite dose) and thin (in use) applications. Contradictory results were obtained. <b>Thickening</b> <b>agents</b> retard skin penetration, {{in a manner}} consistent with a diffusional resistance in the formulation, when applied as an infinite dose. In contrast, when applied as in thin (in use) doses, <b>thickening</b> <b>agents</b> promote penetration, most likely through greater stratum corneum diffusivity arising from an enhanced hydration by the thicker formulations. The two key implications from this work are (i) a recognition of the danger in the potential extrapolation of infinite dosing to in use situations, and (ii) to recognize that thicker formulations may sometimes enhance the penetration of other topical agents when applied “in use”...|$|R
