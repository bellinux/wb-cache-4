5|$|The Arp2/3 {{complex is}} {{composed}} of seven subunits: Arp2, Arp3, p41/ARPC1, p34/ARPC2, p21/ARPC3, p20/ARPC4, p16/ARPC5. The subunits Arp2 & Arp3 closely resemble monomeric actin allowing for a thermodynamically stable actin-like dimer. p41 has been proposed to interact with nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) because it is only known to have minor contacts with the mother filament and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> loss of nucleation efficiency {{in the absence of}} p41. p34 and p20 dimerize to form a structural backbone that mediates the interaction with the mother filament. p21 forms a bridge between Arp3 and the mother filament, increasing nucleation efficiency. p16 tethers Arp2 {{to the rest of the}} complex.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> bus {{terminus}} on the Kowloon side, {{which is}} conveniently situated {{close to the}} Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier. Thousands of residents passed through this principal gateway to Hong Kong Island from the Kowloon Peninsula daily from 1957 until 2006. However, the inauguration of the Cross Harbour Tunnel in 1972 popularised vehicular travel across the harbour and reduced the flow of passengers. From 1972 to 2006, the ferry was still used {{by many as the}} shortest route from Tsim Sha Tsui (TST) to Central District, and a daily average of 74,000 passenger trips were made across the harbour in 2004.|$|E

5|$|Should a new tunnel be built, {{it would}} not {{necessarily}} run next to the Oslo Tunnel. One proposal from the National Rail Administration calls for a separate commuter train station to be built underground, {{at the location of}} Oslo Bus Terminal, within walking distance of OsloS. This proposal involves the line connecting to the existing route before reaching Nationaltheatret. The lobby organisation Norsk Bane have called for a line to run further north, and serve Majorstuen, where <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> metro and tramway hub. Norsk Bane also call for the tunnel to be built for higher speeds, and state {{that it is necessary to}} build high-speed rail to Bergen and Stavanger. Combined with a new line from Drammen to the tunnel, it would allow travel time from Drammen and Oslo to be reduced to 18 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition in which <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E
5|$|Groesbeck Highway runs {{northeast}} from Hoover Street crossing out of Wayne County into Macomb County at 8 Mile Road. The trunkline here is {{parallel to}} railroad tracks through Warren. M-97 crosses Interstate 696 (I-696) at an interchange located on the Warren–Roseville line. This interchange is also located at the 11 Mile Road location in the Mile Road System. M-97 crosses through {{the southeast corner of}} Fraser between 13 Mile and 14 Mile roads after which it enters Clinton Township. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> intersection with Metropolitan Parkway, which is a limited access county primary road that occupies the 16 Mile location Detroit Mile Road System. Between this intersection and Harrington Street, Groesbeck Highway curves around to the north, crossing the Clinton River and the railroad then entering Mt. Clemens. M-97 continues to curve around the west side of downtown Mt. Clemens before re-entering Clinton Township. Groesbeck Highway and M-97 ends at M-59/Hall Road, another limited access county primary road in Macomb County located in place of 20 Mile Road. The northern terminus is on the Clinton Township–Macomb Township line northwest of Selfridge Field, an Air National Guard facility on Lake St. Clair. The road continues north as a county road known as North Avenue.|$|E

25|$|Kondrashov {{argues that}} the {{slightly}} deleterious nature of mutations means that the population will tend to be composed of individuals with {{a small number of}} mutations. Sex will act to recombine these genotypes, creating some individuals with fewer deleterious mutations, and some with more. Because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> selective disadvantage to individuals with more mutations, these individuals die out.

As a result India secedes from the Alliance—and is conquered and enslaved by the Draka within weeks (except Burma, which counter-seceded back to the Alliance). After the 'Indian Incident' the Alliance for Democracy is formally converted into a single superstate.|$|E

25|$|Low-{{frequency}} {{radio waves}} travel easily through brick and stone and VLF even penetrates sea-water. As the frequency rises, absorption effects become more important. At microwave or higher frequencies, absorption by molecular resonances {{in the atmosphere}} (mostly from water, H2O and oxygen, O2) {{is a major factor}} in radio propagation. For example, in the 58–60GHz band, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> absorption peak which makes this band useless for long-distance use. This phenomenon was first discovered during radar research in World War II. Above about 400GHz, the Earth's atmosphere blocks most of the spectrum while still passing some - up to UV light, which is blocked by ozone - but visible light and some of the near-infrared is transmitted.|$|E
25|$|About 1800 BCE, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> {{cultural}} {{change in the}} Swat Valley {{with the emergence of}} the Gandhara grave culture. With its introduction of new ceramics, new burial rites, and the horse, the Gandhara grave culture is a major candidate for early Indo-Aryan presence. The two new burial rites—flexed inhumation in a pit and cremation burial in an urn—were, according to early Vedic literature, both practiced in early Indo-Aryan society. Horse-trappings indicate the importance of the horse to the economy of the Gandharan grave culture. Two horse burials indicate the importance of the horse in other respects. Horse burial is a custom that Gandharan grave culture has in common with Andronovo, though not within the distinctive timber-frame graves of the steppe.|$|E
25|$|The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) {{started the}} {{research}} and development of automated visual surveillance and monitoring (VSAM) program, between 1997 and 1999, and airborne video surveillance (AVS) programs, from 1998 to 2002. Currently, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> effort underway in the vision community to develop a fully automated tracking surveillance system. Automated video surveillance monitors people and vehicles in real time within a busy environment. Existing automated surveillance systems are based on the environment they are primarily designed to observe, i.e., indoor, outdoor or airborne, the amount of sensors that the automated system can handle and the mobility of sensor, i.e., stationary camera vs. mobile camera. The purpose of a surveillance system is to record properties and trajectories of objects in a given area, generate warnings or notify designated authority in case of occurrence of particular events.|$|E
