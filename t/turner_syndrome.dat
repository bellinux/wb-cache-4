5|$|Women {{are more}} likely to develop {{hypothyroidism}} than men. In population-based studies, women were seven times {{more likely than men to}} have TSH levels above 10 mU/l. 2â€“4% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. Subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, subclinical hypothyroidism is more common in the elderly, and in Caucasians. There is a much higher rate of thyroid disorders, the most common of which is hypothyroidism, in individuals with Down syndrome and <b>Turner</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E

25|$|About half of {{individuals}} with <b>Turner</b> <b>syndrome</b> have monosomy X (45,X), which means each cell in a woman's body has only one copy of the X chromosome {{instead of the usual}} two copies. <b>Turner</b> <b>syndrome</b> can also occur if one of the sex chromosomes is partially missing or rearranged rather than completely missing. Some women with <b>Turner</b> <b>syndrome</b> have a chromosomal change in only some of their cells. These cases are called <b>Turner</b> <b>syndrome</b> mosaics (45,X/46,XX).|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To study {{prevalence}} of <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> in Denmark {{and to assess}} validity of prenatal diagnosis. DESIGN [...] Study of data on prenatal and postnatal <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> in Danish Cytogenetic Central Register. SUBJECTS [...] All registered <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> karyotypes (100 prenatal cases and 215 postnatal cases) during 1970 - 93. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Prevalence of <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> karyotypes among prenatally tested fetuses and <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> among liveborn infants. RESULTS [...] Among infant girls, {{prevalence of}} <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> was 32 / 100, 000. Among female fetuses tested by amniocentesis, prevalence of <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> karyotypes was 176 / 100, 000 (relative risk of syndrome, 6. 74 compared with prevalence among untested pregnancies). Among female fetuses tested by chorion villus sampling, prevalence of syndrome karyotypes was 392 / 100, 000 (relative risk, 16. 8). We excluded prenatal tests referred because of results of ultrasound scanning: among fetuses tested by amniocentesis revised relative risk was 5. 68, while revised relative risk among fetuses tested by chorion villus sampling was 13. 3. For 29 fetuses with prenatal diagnosis of possible <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> pregnancy was allowed to continue and 24 children were live born. Thirteen of these children were karyotyped postnatally, and diagnosis of <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> had to be revised for eight, seven being normal girls and one boy. This gives tentative predictive value of amniocentesis in diagnosing <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> of between 21 % and 67 %. There was no significant relation between mother's age and risk of <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] Discrepancy between prenatal and postnatal prevalence of <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> challenges specificity of prenatal examination in diagnosing <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|R

25|$|Women with <b>Turner</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{are almost}} universally infertile. While some women with <b>Turner</b> <b>syndrome</b> have {{successfully}} become pregnant and carried their pregnancies to term, {{this is very}} rare and is generally limited to those women whose karyotypes are not 45,X. Even when such pregnancies do occur, there is a higher than average risk of miscarriage or birth defects, including <b>Turner</b> <b>Syndrome</b> or Down Syndrome. Some women with <b>Turner</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{who are unable to}} conceive without medical intervention may be able to use IVF or other fertility treatments.|$|E

40|$|Osteoporosis is {{a common}} finding in <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> To test the {{hypothesis}} that calcitonin deficiency may contribute to bone mineral loss in <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> we studied basal and calcium-stimulated (2 mg/kg body weight in 5 min) levels of total calcitonin, extractable calcitonin and katacalcin in 15 girls with <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and osteoporosis. Fifteen age-matched healthy girls were studied as controls. Both basal calcitonin (total and extractable) and katacalcin values {{were not significantly different}} in patients with <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> in comparison with those of the controls. The calcium stimulation test showed a similar "C" cell secretory reserve in both groups. The calculation of DELTA-CT/DELTA-iCa of total and extractable calcitonin and DELTA-KC/DELTA-iCa, which accounts for individual variations in serum ionized calcium increases, did not show any significant difference between girls with <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and controls. We conclude that calcitonin deficiency is not a causative factor of osteoporosis in girls with <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and that in this syndrome long-life estrogen deficiency does not impair "C" cell secretory activity...|$|R

40|$|Nocturnal {{growth hormone}} {{secretion}} over a 12 hour period was assessed at 20 minute intervals in 25 prepubertal subjects with <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and 11 normal prepubertal girls of short stature {{to try and}} elucidate the relationship between body weight and endogenous secretion of growth hormone in <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> There were no differences in mean growth hormone concentration, age, height, or growth velocity between the two groups. There was an age related decline in mean growth hormone concentration in patient's with <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{in contrast to the}} age related increase in controls. Mean percentage of ideal body weight was significantly higher in the <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> group than among controls and it increased with age. There was a strong inverse relationship between mean growth hormone concentration and percentage of ideal body weight in those with <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Covariate analysis of the multiple linear regression of mean growth hormone concentration on age and percentage of ideal body weight in <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> indicated that percentage of ideal body weight had a significant effect on endogenous secretion of growth hormone when age was held constant, but not the other way round. We conclude that the age related decline in endogenous secretion of growth hormone in <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is partly the result of increasing body weight with age. The significant influences of biological variables such as age and body weight in the interpretation of measurements of endogenous secretion of growth hormone in <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> should be emphasised...|$|R

40|$|<b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a {{disorder}} defined by an absent or structurally abnormal second X chromosome and affects around 1 in 2000 newborn females. The standardised mortality ratio in <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is around three-times {{higher than in}} the general female population, mainly as a result of cardiovascular disorders. Most striking is the early age at which <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients develop the life-threatening complications of cardiovascular disorders compared to the general population.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} gastric emptying {{in girls}} with <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> to detect if gastrointestinal motor dysfunction was present. SUBJECTS: Thirteen girls (mean age 8. 1 years) with <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> seven girls with familial short stature (6. 1 years), and eight control girls (7. 6 years). METHODS: Gastric emptying studies were performed by using 500 microCi of technetium 99 m-sulphur colloid bound to a scrambled egg, and scintigraphic measurements {{were made for}} 60 to 90 minutes. RESULTS: Mean (SD) percentage retention of gastric isotope was significantly greater in girls with <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> than in children with short stature and in controls. Furthermore, in contrast with control subjects, in whom there was an inverse linear relationship between gastric emptying rate and body mass index, in children with <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> the delay in gastric emptying was independent of the body mass. CONCLUSIONS: The {{results of the study}} suggest that delayed gastric emptying is detectable in girls with <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> independent of age, body mass index, karyotype, and growth promoting treatment...|$|R
40|$|<b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{the most}} common {{chromosomal}} abnormality in females, affecting 1 : 2, 500 live female births. It is a result of absence of an X chromosome or the presence of a structurally abnormal X chromosome. Its most consistent clinical features are short stature and ovarian failure. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that adults with <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> are also susceptible to a range of disorders, including osteoporosis, hypothyroidism, and renal and gastrointestinal disease. Women with <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> have a reduced life expectancy, and recent evidence suggests that this is due to an increased risk of aortic dissection and ischemic heart disease. Up until recently, women with <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> did not have access to focused health care, and thus quality of life was reduced in a significant number of women. All adults with <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> should therefore be followed up by a multidisciplinary team to improve life expectancy and reduce morbidity...|$|R

25|$|As {{more women}} with <b>Turner</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{complete}} pregnancy thanks to modern techniques to treat infertility, {{it has to}} be noted that pregnancy may be a risk of cardiovascular complications for the mother. Indeed, several studies had suggested an increased risk for aortic dissection in pregnancy. The influence of estrogen has been examined but remains unclear. It seems that the high risk of aortic dissection during pregnancy in women with <b>Turner</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{may be due to the}} increased hemodynamic load rather than the high estrogen rate. Of course, these findings are important and need to be remembered while following a pregnant patient with <b>Turner</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{literature}} about oocyte donation {{for patients with}} <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and reports the experience of our center. Before contemplating pregnancy, {{it is essential to}} perform a careful evaluation of the cardiovascular system, the renal system, the thyroid status and the glucose tolerance. Different studies have reported a suboptimal response of the endometrium of women with <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> to oestrogen therapy, and suggested that higher doses of estrogens may be necessary to achieve appropriate endometrial preparation. Pregnancy rate per transfer following oocyte donation is around 30 % for patients with <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> comparable to the one observed for patients with other conditions requiring oocyte donation. Miscarriage rate is however higher (40 - 50 %) after oocyte donation in <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and could be related to the presence of a hypoplastic uterus along with hypovascularization. During pregnancy, cardiovascular complications are potentially the most severe, such as the exacerbation of a preexisting hypertension and the dissection of aortic aneurysms. There is a high rate of Caesarean section among <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients, the main reason being fetopelvic disproportion. Regarding the increased obstetrical risks in <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients, the selective transfer of one embryo should ideally be performed in order to avoid additional risks associated with multiple pregnancies. In our center, 9 patients with a <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> had 15 cycles of oocyte donation. Five pregnancies were obtained among which three were evolutive. The outcome of oocyte donation cycles were comparable for patients with a <b>Turner's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and for patients with other indications of oocyte donation.
