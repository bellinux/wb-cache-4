5|$|The Storm Prediction Center {{employs a}} total of 43 personnel, {{including}} five lead forecasters, ten mesoscale/outlook forecasters, and seven assistant mesoscale forecasters. Many SPC forecasters and support staff are heavily involved in scientific research into severe and hazardous weather. This involves conducting applied research and writing technical papers, developing <b>training</b> <b>materials,</b> giving seminars and other presentations locally and nationwide, attending scientific conferences, and participating in weather experiments.|$|E
5|$|In more {{advanced}} developing countries, establishing ambulance transport systems is more feasible, but still requires considerable expertise and planning. Prior to 2004, Pakistan {{did not have}} an organized emergency medical system. In that year, Rescue 1122 was launched as a professional pre-hospital emergency service, and it has managed to achieve an average response time of 7 minutes, comparable to that of developed nations. Some of the critical factors in its success included local manufacture of vehicles, training instructors to certify emergency medical technicians, adopting <b>training</b> <b>materials</b> to the local context, and branching out to include fire and rescue service response under a united command structure.|$|E

40|$|Companies {{constantly}} {{struggle to}} find solutions that satisfy {{the needs of the}} customers in the market. When they do so, the diffusion of the new product or service may ascend naturally among the population. However, for a product or service to be successful, customers must perceive the value of that product or service and its advantages. Thus, it is important to create a product or service that creates value for customers, but also to be able to communicate it effectively, hence increasing its diffusion among the population. The objective {{of this study is to}} discuss investment in appropriate <b>training</b> <b>material</b> to enhance the technology diffusion among the population. When selling a new product, customers are not aware of its functionalities and thus, <b>training</b> <b>material</b> as a tool to help the customers is needed. Developing the <b>training</b> <b>material</b> previously to the sales of the product brings advantages to the company. In other words, the company is using the <b>training</b> <b>material</b> not only to clarify the functionalities of the product to the customers, but also as a way to attract customers. The key outcome of this study is the creation of a framework based on literature review that represents the increase in technology diffusion when investing in appropriate <b>training</b> <b>material.</b> Further, the ideas of product life cycle and customer value are introduced as a way to understand the intensification in technology diffusion when investment in <b>training</b> <b>material</b> is already done in the introduction phase of product life cycle. In addition, in the beginning of the life of a product, the <b>training</b> <b>material</b> should be more customized according to customer characteristics. On the other hand, the more on the right in the product life cycle curve, the more productized the <b>training</b> <b>material</b> should be...|$|R

5|$|There was {{no system}} at Port Chicago for making sure {{officers}} {{and men were}} familiar with safety regulations. Two formal lectures and several informal lectures {{were given to the}} enlisted men by commanding officers, but follow-up confirmation of retained knowledge did not take place. Safety regulations were posted at a single location at the pier but not within each of the barracksKinne did not think the enlisted men would be able to comprehend such a list. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) responded to word of unsafe practices by offering to bring in experienced men to train the battalion but Navy leadership declined the offer, fearing higher costs, slower pace, and possible sabotage from civilian longshoremen. No enlisted man stationed at Port Chicago had ever received formal training in the handling and loading of explosives into ships. Even the officers did not receive training: Lieutenant Commander Alexander Holman, loading officer at Port Chicago whose duties included officer training, had initiated a search for <b>training</b> <b>materials</b> and samples but failed to organize a training class before disaster struck.|$|E

25|$|Farncomb was {{launched}} on 15 December 1995: {{as she was}} the first submarine to be completely constructed in Australia (two sections of Collins had been assembled in Sweden), the submarine wore a large Made In Australia logo on the fin. The submarine commenced sea trials in September 1996. Lessons learned from the trials of lead boat Collins benefitted Farncomb, with <b>training</b> <b>materials</b> improved and the trials crew instructed to familiarise themselves with the submarine while she was being completed (the crew of Collins had the option to, but most personnel did not). The trial program was impacted on by problems with Collins.|$|E
25|$|Several causes were identified: {{the late}} {{completion}} of the design made preparing <b>training</b> <b>materials</b> difficult, subcontractors did not always {{provide detailed information on}} the operation of their equipment, the combat system training was based on the completed version of the software and not the partial system installed in Collins, and the training assumed that none of the systems would break down. The last problem was part of an overall attitude that the first boat would be perfect off the production line and that no breakdowns would occur, and as a result, early equipment manuals tended to be light on content, and Collins would be sent to sea with few spare parts.|$|E

25|$|While Heath/Zenith's {{computer}} {{business was}} successful, {{the growing popularity}} of home computers as a hobby hurt the company because many customers began writing computer programs instead of assembling Heathkits. While their assembly was still an interesting and educational hobby, kits were no longer less expensive than preassembled products; BYTE reported in 1984 that the kit version of the Z-150 IBM PC compatible cost $100 more than the preassembled computer from some dealers, but needed about 20 hours and soldering skills to assemble. The continuation of the integration trend (printed circuit boards, integrated circuits, etc.), and mass production of electronics (especially computer manufacturing overseas and plug-in modules) eroded the basic Heathkit business model. Assembling a kit might still be fun, but it could no longer save much money. The switch to surface mount components and LSI ICs finally made it impossible for the home assembler to construct an electronic device for significantly less money than assembly line factory products. As sales of its kits dwindled during the decade, Heath relied on its <b>training</b> <b>materials</b> and a new venture in home automation and lighting products to stay afloat. When Zenith eventually sold ZDS to Groupe Bull in 1989, Heathkit was included in the deal.|$|E

These <b>training</b> <b>materials</b> emphasized regional command and control of air defenses. Fighter group commanders were to direct the efforts of anti-aircraft artillery officersâ€”one of Saville's suggestions that had been a sticking point, resisted by artillerists.
