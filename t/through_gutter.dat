50|$|For Regen, these {{aesthetic}} {{properties are}} reflected in the construction and the creativity of the film. It has a loosely narrative structure: it first presents the viewer with a situation: Amsterdam, its rooftops, its canals, and fleetingly, its residents going about their business. Next, the viewer is presented with an incident: slowly, raindrops begin to send minuscule ripples through a canal, a breeze picks up, birds take flight. Rain falls harder and we begin to take closer, longer looks at individuals adapting to their changed environment. The shots are mostly anonymous—faces passing quickly and blending into crowds as umbrellas are raised. As the streets clear (the film was shot over months but we are made to feel this is all happening over the course of an afternoon), focus shifts to rain’s interaction with nature and architecture—filling the dams, flowing <b>through</b> <b>gutter</b> pipes, obscuring the view of Amsterdam’s rooftops. And finally, we return to the status quo: though evidence of the storm remains—the streets are still silvered and all the guardrails hold drops of water—the canals have returned to a glassy calm and everywhere people are emerging from indoors. Amsterdam is vibrant and lively once again.|$|E
40|$|Book chapter {{partially}} available at: [URL] is {{a strong}} demand for accurate and up-to-date road network information. Road network knowledge is crucial for the creation and the update of maps, geographic information system (GIS) database, transportation or land planning. For local authorities, cartography of the road network is needed for urban planning, dirty water collection <b>through</b> <b>gutter</b> network (most often located under roads), traffic flow analysis or pollution mapping. Closely related applications are geo-marketing, electricity and telecommunication networks, databases for car navigation [...] . Currently, road network cartography is essentially done by human interpretations of high resolution aerial images and additional in situ information. This is a long and tedious work that requires to be done again for each update of the road network. High spatial resolution imagery is recently available for civilian applications and reveals the very fine details of the imaged area. Examples of high resolution satellites are SPOT 5, Ikonos, Quickbird, OrbView or EROS. The term ‘high resolution' is relative and refers to satellites with spatial resolutions better than 5 meters in the panchromatic channel (one can even talk about very high resolution when the image resolution is better than 1 meter). The current availability of high spatial resolution images represents an undeniable asset to Earth observation. The urban environment, {{that is the most}} difficult context because of its high complexity and information density, could benefit the most from high resolution imagery (Puissant and Weber, 2002). In addition to the increased precision for the road detection and location, high resolution satellite imagery can be used for numerous cases where the access to the studied area is difficult: administrative constraints, authorization to overfly the area, conflicts, wars or natural catastrophes [...] . Moreover, satellite means is significantly cheaper than aerial or in situ data acquisition campaigns. As promising as it is, the use of high resolution images for road extraction induces a change in the road representation, and a significant increase of noise. Moreover, quantitative assessment of the results has to be redesigned when dealing with such images. In this chapter, a new method suitable for high resolution images is proposed. Originally designed for urban area, this method can naturally be applied on easier cases such as rural or semi-rural areas. The chapter is structured as follow: the change in the road representation induces by high resolution imagery is first presented. A short survey on road extraction with the evolution from linear to surface models for road is proposed (section 2). A new method for extracting road networks from high spatial resolution images is then described. It models roads as a surface and is built on cooperation between linear and surface representation of roads. In order to overcome local artifacts, the method makes use of advanced image processing tools, such as active contours and the wavelet transform (section 3). An example of application of the method on a high resolution image from the Quickbird satellite is proposed. The result is quantitatively assessed compared to human interpretation (section 4). This chapter concludes with a discussion on the principal benefits of the method and on future prospects (section 5) ...|$|E

French specificity resides in high proportions of dairy buildings including straw- based deep litter. Because little is known about emissions from these systems, the aim of our experiment was to compare gas emissions from two contrasted manure managements in controlled conditions: a tie-stall (TS) producing slurry and a straw-based deep litter (DL) producing farmyard manure. Two groups of three dairy cattle were offered both treatments in a Latin-square design during two periods of six weeks. Mean daily emissions were 78 %, 33 %, 25 % and 85 % higher for DL compared to TS, respectively, for C-CO 2, C-CH 4, N-NH 3 and N-N 2 O. These emissions were high compared to the literature, which could be partly due to overestimation of ventilation rates and/or polluted air entering the rooms <b>through</b> <b>gutters.</b> CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from DL increased throughout accumulation time because of anaerobic conditions. At the end of the experiment, without animals and new fresh manure input, emissions from the litter alone rapidly decreased.

40|$|The {{application}} of seals as surfacing on South African roads has increased {{due to its}} dual advantage in performance potential and sustainability.

Run-off tests were conducted in the laboratory by constructing surfacing seals with varying texture depths.

50|$|Very {{soon after}} 25 BC the {{urbanization}} and {{transformation of the}} Pessinuntian temple state into a Greek polis began. Constructions such as a Corinthian temple and a colonnaded street (cardo maximus) were erected with the marble from the quarries located at İstiklalbağı, ca. 6 km north of the city. The boundaries of Pessinus must have been fixed, as were those of the newly founded colony of Germakoloneia (near Babadat), which received part of the area inhabited by the Tolistobogioi. It {{has been argued that}} Pessinous and the other Galatian cities received a constitution based on that of the cities in Pontus-Bithynia, imposed by the lex Pompeia. From the inscriptions it appears that Pessinus possessed several public buildings, including a gymnasium, a theatre, an archive, and baths. A system of water supply has been discovered <b>through</b> <b>gutters</b> and terracotta pipes. The most impressive public construction of the early Imperial period was the canalisation system, the earliest part of which dates from the Augustan age. It was meant to retain and carry away the waters of the Gallos, the seasonal river which traverses Pessinus and which was the main north-south artery (cardo maximus) of the city. From the 1st to the 3rd century AD the canal was continuously expanded until it finally reached a lengt of ca. 500 m and a width of 11 to 13 m. It is not known when exactly the large theatre, of which is preserved only the emplacement of the cavea where the spectators were seated, was constructed, but it was repaired or embellished by Hadrian.Other monumental buildings, erected under the reign of Tiberius, included the marble peripteros temple of the provincial Imperial cult, a Sebasteion, on a hill at the north-western end of the canal, a stairway combined with a theatre in front (with an orchestra where religious and other performances such as gladiator fights took place). The colonnaded square lower down the valley was reconstructed by Verlinde. In the past, this structure was wrongly situated in the Tiberian era, but it was shown that it was a monument of the Hellenistic age (late 2nd-early 1st century BC), and contemporary with the citadel that preceded the temple complex.Christianity reached the area in the 3rd century, {{and at the end of}} the 4th century, the temple of Augustus was decommissioned. Perhaps as a sign of the rise of Christianity in Pessinus, Emperor Julian the Apostate made a pilgrimage to Pessinus and wrote an angry letter concerning the disrespect shown to the sanctuary of Cybele. In ca. 398, Pessinus was established as the capital of the newly established province of Galatia Salutaris (in the civil Diocese of Pontus), and became the seat of a Metropolitan Archbishop. The region later became part of the Byzantine Anatolic Theme.|$|R
