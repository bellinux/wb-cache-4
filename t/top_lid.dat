40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} with rotating annuli are reported that reveal a prograde jet, which is adjacent either to a (longitudinally) librating inner straight cylinder or to a librating inner truncated cone (frustum), whereas the outer cylindrical wall and bottom and <b>top</b> <b>lids</b> rotate with constant angular velocity. In the frustum case, the jet {{is located on}} a straight cylindrical surface which is circumscribed about the frustum and joins the bottom lid. These findings are supported by direct numerical simulations which show good agreement between experimental data and numerical results and, when the centrifugal instability of the Stokes boundary layer near the oscillating sidewall does not set in, highlight {{the important role of}} local dynamical processes in the corners, between the inner cylinder and the lids, in producing the prograde jet...|$|R
50|$|A Spanische Windtorte {{consists}} of rings of meringue {{that have been}} baked into a cylindrical form with a bottom and a <b>top</b> <b>lid.</b> The piping of the meringue and the subsequent baking process require patience and careful attention to detail or the cake will not be symmetrical. When the shell of the torte is done it is then filled with whipped cream, fresh berries (usually strawberries), chocolate shavings and/or currants. Because whipped cream and meringue dissolve quickly the torte must be served immediately. Freezing can retain the dessert's consistency but the flavor may be compromised.|$|E
50|$|The gold twenty-five-year service cross was {{the first}} class award. It was of the same design as the second class award but the four-pointed cross (Ordenskreuz) was of gold rather than silver. The 18 and 25 year medals both had a similar {{presentation}} case: a hinged box with an exterior of green simulated leather, but with different interiors. The top of the case had either the number 18 or 25 embossed on it. The inside <b>top</b> <b>lid</b> of the case was white satin and the lower portion was velvet.|$|E
50|$|The stick was {{assembled}} {{by placing the}} PCB within the lower case and routing the cable out of the box. The stick was then placed {{on top of the}} post, and a flexible rubbery cover was placed over the stick. A red plastic button was placed over the fifth switch, providing the fire button, and the <b>top</b> <b>lid</b> then placed on top of the entire assembly. Four machine screws inserted {{from the bottom of the}} case through the PCB support protrusions held the lid on, and held everything in place through compression.|$|E

These varied in design and effectiveness; examples include Razer's side wings, Hypno-Disc's srimech bar and Panic Attack's <b>top</b> <b>lid.</b> These did not detract from the weapon, but could easily break if damaged repeatedly, and also took {{up some of the}} robot's precious weight allowance - Razer, after the addition of its wings, had to have over 450 holes drilled into it to keep it within the 79.4 kg (175 lb) weight limit.|$|E
50|$|The {{outer housing}} of the FOEP is a pressure-tight {{canister}} 181⁄16 inches (458.8 mm) {{in diameter and}} 18½ inches (470 mm) long. The bottom closure and removable <b>top</b> <b>lid</b> are both slightly domed to prevent implosion should pressure reversals be encountered. The inner assembly structure is fastened to a support ring approximately 6 inches {{from the bottom of}} the canister and consists of upper and lower bulkheads joined by a cylinder. Cutouts in the cylinder permit access to the centrifuge, which houses the frogs. Near the top of the canister are two electrical feed-through receptacles for the power supply and data line.|$|E
50|$|Use {{of the box}} {{initially}} involves {{digging a}} hole in the ground by a human or a machine. One to three plants are planted in the hole, and a cardboard panel is placed around the plants. In dry areas, the soil around the plants is inoculated with mycorrhizae to release nutrients in the soil that would otherwise be chemically inaccessible to the growing plants. A wick is inserted in the bottom of the Groasis which is then lowered over the plants and filled with water. Two lids are put on, funnels inserted and a cap plugs the <b>top</b> <b>lid.</b>|$|E

50|$|The chests were {{originally}} made of oak, {{although they were}} ultimately also offered in cherry, walnut, and maple. While a single batch of chests (numbering as many as fifty) is being built, the drawers are selected and grouped together based on the style of their grain. Each drawer is then designated for a particular slot in a chest. The chests are assembled, sanded, and finished {{all in the same}} building, and most models also receive felt drawer lining. The tall, narrow center drawer on the popular Model 52 is sized to hold a copy of Machinery's Handbook, and the mirror inside the <b>top</b> <b>lid</b> was reportedly included to aid machinists in removing metal filings from their eyes.|$|E
5000|$|The Hellenistic period funerary urns were {{generally}} made in two pieces. The <b>top</b> <b>lid</b> usually depicted a banqueting {{man or woman}} (but not always) and the container part was either decorated in relief in the front only or, on more elaborate stone pieces, carved on its sides. During this period, the terracotta urns were being mass-produced using clay in Northern Etruria (specifically in and around Chiusi). Often the scenes decorated in relief {{on the front of}} the urn were depicting generic Greek influenced scenes. The production of these urns did not require skilled artists and so what we are left with is often mediocre, unprofessional art, made en masse. However the color choices on the urns offer evidence as to dating, as colors used changed over time.|$|E
5000|$|A {{consequence}} of the windproofing {{is that it is}} hard to extinguish a Zippo by blowing out the flame. However, if the flame is blown from the top down, it will be easily extinguished. The proper way to extinguish the lighter is to close the top half, which starves the flame of oxygen, but unlike other lighters, this does not cut the fuel. One of the recognizable features of Zippo is the fact that it burns with a wick. Opening the <b>top</b> <b>lid</b> produces an easily recognizable [...] "clink" [...] sound for which Zippo lighters are known, and a different but similarly recognizable [...] "clunk" [...] when the lighter is closed. This noise is produced by the spring-loaded toggling cam, a little lever that keeps the lid closed or opened securely.|$|E

40|$|The {{first step}} in the DNA {{profiling}} process is the recovery of DNA from the crime scene or item. Such surfaces can be varying with absorbent and non-absorbent surfaces. Ridged surfaces, such as those encountered on bottle-tops or firearms, are also common. Although low trace DNA or “touch DNA” is problematic in forensic casework, ridged surfaces should be a more effective surface for the recovery of such DNA due their abrasive nature. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate six recovery techniques; single wet swab, dry-wet double swab, wet-dry double swab, flocked swab, PCR square, and tape lifts. 36 falcon tubes with screw <b>top</b> <b>lids</b> were sterilised before DNA was deposited on the screw-top lids. Each of the recovery techniques were then utilised on 6 screw-top lids. All recovery media then underwent standard DNA extraction prior to DNA quantification by UV/Vis spectroscopy and quantitative PCR. The data indicated that the tape lifts recovered significantly more DNA from the ridged surface than the other techniques. There was no significant difference between the remaining 5 techniques, although on average, flocked swabs recovered the least amount. This suggested that the success in recovery of DNA is not down to the particular technique used, but down to the competence of the individual examiner and the amount of DNA deposited onto the surface...|$|R
