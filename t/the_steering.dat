5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism is in front of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
5|$|Several effects {{influence}} <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> angle, {{the angle}} {{at which the}} front assembly is rotated about <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> axis, necessary to maintain a steady-state turn.

5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> axis ground contact point. <b>The</b> <b>steering</b> axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Automotive steer-by-wire {{system uses}} {{electronic}} signaling {{to transfer the}} command and causes <b>the</b> motor-driven <b>steering.</b> It can improve the maneuverability and stability of <b>the</b> driver <b>steering.</b> This article first discussed <b>the</b> car-by-wire <b>steering</b> system structure and working principle. Then, it builds the in-the-loop simulation based on the test bed of automotive steer-by-wire system. Moreover, this paper researches the test bad design of the automotive steer-by-wire system. The operation module controller is designed based on the of the automotive steer-by-wire system. At last, {{we can find out}} the qualitative simulation results...|$|R
5|$|Third, {{because the}} front and rear tires can have {{different}} slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. When understeering, <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> angle must be greater, and when oversteering, <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> angle must be less than it would be if the slip angles were equal to maintain a given turn radius. Some authors even use the term counter-steering to refer to the need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage.|$|E
5|$|Wobble or shimmy {{begins when}} some {{otherwise}} minor irregularity, such as fork asymmetry, accelerates {{the wheel to}} one side. The restoring force is applied in phase with {{the progress of the}} irregularity, and the wheel turns to the other side where the process is repeated. If there is insufficient damping in <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> the oscillation will increase until system failure occurs. The oscillation frequency can be changed by changing the forward speed, making the bike stiffer or lighter, or increasing the stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>steering,</b> of which the rider is a main component.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{in the section}} on balance, one effect of turning the front wheel is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the front wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> axis and the vertical.|$|E

40|$|We study <b>the</b> {{dynamics}} of <b>steering</b> between two correlated Unruh-Dewitt detectors {{when one of}} them locally interacts with external scalar field via different quantifiers. We find that <b>the</b> quantum <b>steering,</b> either measured by <b>the</b> entropic <b>steering</b> inequality or <b>the</b> Cavalcanti-Jones-Wiseman-Reid inequality, is fragile under the influence of Unruh thermal noise. <b>The</b> quantum <b>steering</b> is found always asymmetric and the asymmetry is extremely sensitive to the initial state parameter. In addition, the steering-type quantum correlations experience "sudden death" for some accelerations, which are quite different from the behaviors of other quantum correlations in the same system. It is worth noting that the domination value of <b>the</b> tight quantum <b>steering</b> exists a transformation point with increasing acceleration. We also find that the robustness of quantum steerability under the Unruh thermal noise can be realized by choosing the smallest energy gap in the detectors. Comment: 18 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

5|$|Bicycles {{have been}} constructed, for {{investigation}} and demonstration purposes, with <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> reversed so that turning the handlebars {{to the left}} causes the front wheel {{to turn to the}} right, and vica versa.

5|$|Bike {{maneuverability}} {{and handling}} {{is difficult to}} quantify for several reasons. The geometry of a bike, especially <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> axis angle makes kinematic analysis complicated. Under many conditions, bikes are inherently unstable and must always be under rider control. Finally, the rider's skill has a large influence on the bike's performance in any maneuver. Bike designs tend to consist of a trade-off between maneuverability and stability.|$|E
5|$|Bikes may {{experience}} {{a variety of}} longitudinal forces and motions.
