50|$|Although signing {{his first}} {{professional}} contract with Hajduk {{in the summer}} of 1970, Katalinić had to wait more than a year for the debut. The long-awaited day occurred on 29 September 1971 when he came on as a substitute for injured Radomir Vukcevic in Champions Cup first round return leg in Split against Valencia. In a stiff competition Katalinić was not a first choice goalkeeper until 1975. He kept his number one jersey in next two seasons before losing it to obligatory military service. Upon his return from army in May 1979, Katalinić played only one game adding three more at the beginning the following season. <b>Transfer</b> <b>abroad</b> was on horizon.

50|$|In 1978, 24-year-old Žungul {{received}} lucrative {{offers from}} NASL {{clubs in the}} United States. The sporting regulations of SFR Yugoslavia stated that players can't <b>transfer</b> <b>abroad</b> until serving out their mandatory army stint and turning 28 years of age. In certain cases exceptions were made so that a player's transfer would be allowed in the calendar year during which he'll be turning 28 or even a year early, but {{the completion of the}} army stint was absolutely mandatory. Being 24 years of age, Žungul was thus years away from even considering a move abroad, however, also being on bad terms with club management led by club president Tito Kirigin over unpaid wages, Žungul became concerned Hajduk would send him off to serve the mandatory military stint just to further delay the payments they owed him.|$|E

The next year Hass transferred to Berlin's Humboldt University and embarked on a degree course in History.

5000|$|Hudson, in {{his first}} work, [...] "A {{financial}} payments-flow analysis of U.S. international transactions, 1960—1968" [...] Hudson showed that US export statistics erroneously include a class of goods whose <b>transfer</b> <b>abroad</b> does not involve payment at any time from residents of one nation to those of another and which are for this reason not really international transactions at all.Primary among this class of goods are the transfers of aircraft parts and components by U'S. international airlines to their overseas air terminals and installation on their aircraft. These transfers were brought into the host country under bond and therefore were excluded from their import statistics. At the same time, their value {{was included in the}} US export statistics as a credit. Therefore, the government sector has been in sizable deficit on a payments-flow basis during 1960-1968, resulting mainly from its military operations, but existing account system. that mixed government and private flows did't show the existing problem and the source of deficit as well. In his monograph Hudson made an attempt to divide the U.S. balance of payments into government and private sectors.|$|E
5000|$|Four {{months after}} leaving Belgrade, in mid-April 2004, the row over terms of Matthäus' {{contract}} with Partizan was opened with both parties publicly {{going back and}} forth at each other. It began with Matthäus, by now Hungarian national team head coach, giving a detailed interview to Serbian press in which he accused Partizan club leadership of breaching the additional terms of his contract. It became known on that occasion that his initial contract with Partizan that was finalized on 1 January 2003 included a base guaranteed part as well additional premium clauses giving him between 5-10% from players' transfers and shirt sponsorships (as well as Champions League bonus incentives). Matthäus said that after none of that was honoured he gave up on asking for his percentages of the Danko Lazović and Zvonimir Vukić transfers as well as Superfund shirt sponsorship deal due to [...] "not wanting to upset the team atmosphere during Champions League qualifying", but instead pushed for the additional terms to be renegotiated. After successful Champions League qualification, the additional terms were in fact renegotiated with Partizan's general secretary Žarko Zečević so that both parties agreed to put the previous additional terms out of effect and instead now give Matthäus 15% of Igor Duljaj's (the club's best young asset at the time) future <b>transfer</b> <b>abroad</b> as well as to allow Matthäus to leave the club any time he wanted without penalties. Duljaj was sold to Shakhtar Donetsk in January 2004 for US$4 million, and Matthäus claimed Partizan failed to pay him the agreed percentage ($600,000 or €469,500). The club responded two days later in a lengthy press release saying that they don't owe him any money. One day after that, Matthäus decided to sue Partizan for the amount of US$600,000 before Sports Arbitration Court in Lausanne, Switzerland.|$|E
