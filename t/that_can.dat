Cold waves are usually accompanied with severe snowstorms or extremely cold conditions <b>that</b> <b>can</b> have a devastating impact on the country's economy. These snowstorms and/or extremely cold conditions can partially or completely paralyze activities in large areas of Patagonia and the center of the country. In addition, cold conditions can lead to energy shortages during the winter months due to increased demand. The low temperatures brought by these cold waves can cause frosts <b>that</b> <b>can</b> damage plants, severely affecting agricultural production and devastating the local economy.|$|E

Players assume control of Marius Titus, a Roman general who is on a quest to avenge his murdered family.

For instance, players are {{equipped}} with a sword <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be used to strike and kill enemies, and a shield <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be used to deflect enemies' attack and break their defense. The strength of each attack can be decided by players. In addition to melee-based combat, the game features spears and javelins, which serve as ranged weapons.|$|E
