5|$|Also in {{the early}} 1980s, several studies {{suggested}} a link between children's consumption of aspirin and Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal disease. By 1986, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required warning labels on all aspirin, further suppressing sales. The makers of Tylenol also {{filed a lawsuit against}} Anacin aspirin maker American Home Products, claiming that the failure to add warning labels before 1986 had unfairly held back Tylenol sales, though <b>this</b> <b>suit</b> was eventually dismissed.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Croatia sued Yugoslavia {{before the}} International Court of Justice (ICJ), {{claiming}} genocide {{had been committed}} in Vukovar. Following Serbia and Montenegro's dissolution in 2006, <b>this</b> <b>suit</b> was passed on to Serbia. In February 2015, the ICJ ruled that the battle and ensuing massacre did not constitute genocide, but affirmed that serious crimes had been committed by the JNA and Serb paramilitaries.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Colt {{received}} an extension on his patent {{since he did}} not collect {{on it in the}} early years. In 1852, gun makers James Warner and Massachusetts Arms infringed on the patent. Colt sued the companies and the court ordered that Warner and Massachusetts Arms cease revolver production. Colt then threatened to sue Allen & Thurber over the cylinder design of their double-action pepperbox revolver. However, Colt's lawyers doubted that <b>this</b> <b>suit</b> would have been successful and the case was resolved with a settlement of $15,000. Production of Allen pepperboxes continued until the expiration of Colt's patent in 1857. In 1854 Colt fought for his patent extension with the U.S. Congress, who launched a special committee to investigate charges that Colt had bribed government officials in securing this extension. By August he was exonerated and the story became national news when Scientific American reported that the fault was not with Colt, but with Washington politicians. With a virtual monopoly, Colt sold his pistols in Europe, where demand was high due to tense international relations. By telling each nation that the others were buying Colt's pistols, Colt was able to get large orders from many countries who feared falling behind in the arms race.|$|E

5|$|From a {{historical}} perspective, however, Robertson's most important contribution was made {{not on a}} basketball court, but rather {{in a court of}} law. It was the year of the landmark Robertson v. National Basketball Ass'n, an antitrust suit filed by the NBA's Players Association against the league. As Robertson was the president of the Players Association, the case bore his name. In <b>this</b> <b>suit,</b> the proposed merger between the NBA and American Basketball Association was delayed until 1976, and the college draft as well as the free agency clauses were reformed. Robertson himself stated that the main reason was that clubs basically owned their players: players were forbidden to talk to other clubs once their contract was up, because free agency did not exist back then. Six years after the suit was filed, the NBA finally reached a settlement, the ABA–NBA merger took place, and the Oscar Robertson suit encouraged signing of more free agents and eventually led to higher salaries for all players.|$|E

25|$|The first {{diving suit}} designs {{appeared}} in the early 18th century. Two English inventors developed the first pressure-proof diving suits in the 1710s. John Lethbridge built a completely enclosed suit to aid in salvage work. It consisted of a pressure-proof air-filled barrel with a glass viewing hole and two watertight enclosed sleeves. <b>This</b> <b>suit</b> gave the diver more maneouverability to accomplish useful underwater salvage work.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 2008, Zuffa filed {{a lawsuit}} in Clark County District Court in Nevada, citing breach of {{contract}} and irreparable damage, seeking over $10,000 in damages. <b>This</b> <b>suit</b> only concerned Couture's employment contract and not his promotional contract.

This style of suit links South Asia with the women's firaq partug (frock and shalwar) of northwestern Pakistan and Afghanistan and to the traditional women's clothing of parts of Central Asia. It also links to the Punjab region, where the Anarkali suit is similar to the anga and the Peshwaz worn in Jammu.|$|E

25|$|When {{an alien}} comes to Earth on a rampage, Booster coins the name Doomsday for it. While battling the entity, Booster's costume is destroyed.

During a later battle with Devastator, a servant of the Overmaster, Booster is nearly killed and loses an arm. Again, Blue Beetle comes to his aid, designing a suit {{that acts as a}} life support system in addition to replicating the powers of Booster's previous costumes. <b>This</b> <b>suit</b> also includes a cybernetic replacement arm.|$|E
25|$|A second lawsuit, also filed as a class-action, was {{initiated}} against Valve, Martin, Cassel, and CSGO Lotto by a Florida mother in July 2016 {{shortly after the}} CSGO Lotto discovery. <b>This</b> <b>suit</b> states that Valve enables gambling by minors and users such as Martin and Cassel promote this, all considered illegal activities under federal racketeering laws and Florida consumer protection laws. ESPN outlined the story of Elijah Ballard, one of the 44 plaintiffs in the case, who had become addicted to skins gambling when he was twelve years old, using his parents' credit cards and bank accounts to purchase skins.|$|E
25|$|On 3 September 2007, an Osaka woman {{filed suit}} against Nova over a refund related issue. Unlike {{previous}} complaints about how Nova adjusted the value of unused lesson points on which the Supreme Court ruled in June 2007, <b>this</b> <b>suit</b> contested Nova's decision not to refund lesson points that were extended after the woman purchased additional points. The woman claims that while Nova explained that her unused points (worth approximately 400,000 yen) from the first contract would carry over after signing a new contract, she was not told {{that they could not}} be refunded if she chose to cancel.|$|E
