According to Hindu legend, the walk removes sins, fulfils desires and helps achieve freedom from the cycle of birth and rebirth. Offerings are made in a string of tanks, shrines, pillared meditation halls, springs and caves around the hill. The circumambulation continues {{during the rest of the}} month. On the day of yearly Chitra Pournami, the full moon of the Tamil calendar, hundreds {{of thousands}} of pilgrims come from across the world to worship Annamalaiyar. Five temple cars, called <b>ther,</b> with wooden carvings, are used for the procession.|$|E

5|$|Signs of pre-Harappan {{settlements}} {{have been}} found at Siswal, Lohari Ragho and Mingni khera in Hisar district. One of the four pre-Harappan phases has been named Sothi-Siswal period (3200–2600 BC) on this site. Harappa settlements can be found as well in Rakhigarhi. The site covers 2180 hectares, making it the largest Harappan site known in India and the second-biggest overall after Mohenjodaro. All the sites are maintained by Archaeological Survey of India. Agroha is another place of historical importance. It is situated about 24km {{from the city and}} was once the capital of king Agrasena, who is believed to have lived during the last stages of Dwapar Yuga in the Mahabharat era. Remains of his capital have been excavated, known as Agroha Mound or locally as <b>Ther,</b> and belong to around 3000 BC. The city was also a major centre during the Mauryan period as Buddhist and Jain temples have also been revealed in the excavations.|$|E

25|$|The delayed brigade {{counter-attack}} {{was ordered}} for dawn on 21 January, spearheaded by the 2LR but the 6RNR and 3/16PR were incapable of attacking so soon and the 2LR {{had only just}} arrived; the attack was postponed again but with orders to begin as soon as possible. At 20:00, Arthur Percival (General Officer Commanding Malaya Command) decided that the Japanese capture of the Pelandok defile seriously endangered the Westforce line of communications and ordered Bennett to continue to withdraw south of Labis to a line from Paloh to the Sungei Gerchang bridge {{on the road to}} Labis and to detach a brigade as soon as possible to dig in at the Yong Peng road junction. As the 27th Australian Brigade covered Yong Peng, Percival put all troops on the Muar–Yong Peng road back under the command of Westforce at 12:30. The counter-attack by the 53rd Brigade never occurred; at 10:30 on 21 January, Key visited the brigade and found that half of his orders had not been transmitted, that the brigade had not planned an attack and the 2LR had been sent to dig in at the east end of the causeway. An attack could be arranged for 14:00 but more confusion occurred and the start time was moved to 15:30. The Japanese positions gave a view of the ground east of the ridge, making surprise impossible to achieve and more time was needed to arrange artillery support and concentrate the 2LR. The attack was postponed again to 18:00 and then to the morning of 22 January. The artillery took so long to register that <b>ther</b> was another postponement to 09:00 but the 2LR who had assembled under cover of night were spotted by Japanese reconnaissance aircraft and bombed and strafed. With no prospect of surprise and doubtful that the attack could succeed, Duke cancelled the operation and redeployed the three battalions to guard the causeway and the ground from there to the defile.|$|E
