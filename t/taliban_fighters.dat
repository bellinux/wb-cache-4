5|$|Despite their injuries, the SEALs made a {{defensive}} retreat through the steep woods. Dietz begins to lose consciousness and shouts questions to Luttrell, unwittingly revealing the team's position to the Taliban. Murphy and Axelson jump off another ridge to flee from the <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighters.</b> Luttrell tries to carry Dietz down the mountain, but Dietz is {{shot in the}} shoulder; the impact forces Luttrell to lose his grip and fall forward off the cliff. A dying Dietz remains {{at the top of}} the cliff and is killed by the Taliban insurgents. Murphy decides to try climbing back up the cliff to get a phone signal in order to call in support forces via satellite phone. Axelson and Luttrell shoot at the <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighters</b> to provide Murphy with cover. When he finally reaches higher ground, Murphy is able to alert the SEAL base of his team's location and request emergency assistance right before he is shot dead by <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighters.</b>|$|E

5|$|Petry {{placed a}} {{tourniquet}} {{on his right}} arm. Roberts began to fire at the <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighters,</b> suppressing them in the courtyard. An additional fighter on {{the east end of}} the courtyard fired, fatally wounding Gathercole. Higgins and Robinson returned fire, killing that fighter. They were joined by Sergeant First Class Jerod Staidle, the platoon sergeant, and Specialist Gary Depriest, a medic. Directing the medic to treat Gathercole, Petry was assisted by Staide and Higgins to the casualty collection point.|$|E
5|$|The Taliban {{surrounded}} the remote base and its observation post, attacking it from Quam and surrounding farmland. They destroyed {{much of the}} U.S. heavy munitions, broke through American lines, and entered the main base before being repelled by artillery and aircraft. The United States claimed to have killed at least 21 <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighters</b> {{for the loss of}} nine U.S. soldiers killed and 27 wounded, and four Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers wounded.|$|E
5|$|On October 3, 2009, {{according}} to a report published by U.S. Army historian Richard S. Lowry, <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighters</b> launched a coordinated attack on the outpost from three sides at about 06:00, capturing its ammunition depot. Some 300 fighters participated in the attack armed with a recoilless rifle, rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, machine guns, and small arms, badly outnumbering the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) presence of about 85 U.S. Army, Afghan National Army and Latvian Army soldiers, and the 35 Afghan soldiers who abandoned their positions. It would later be known as the Battle of Kamdesh.|$|E
500|$|A <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighter</b> threw {{a grenade}} at their {{position}} which landed 10 meters from them; it detonated, and the blast knocked the three soldiers to the ground, wounding Higgins, and further wounding Robinson. Shortly thereafter {{the three were}} joined by Staff Sergeant James Roberts and Specialist Christopher Gathercole. A <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighter</b> threw another grenade, which landed {{a few feet from}} Higgins and Robinson.

50|$|Once {{inside the}} compound, Checque {{was shot by}} a <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighter</b> from within the single room where the hostages were held. Undeterred, Byers burst into the room, {{shooting}} dead an armed <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighter.</b> Byers tackled and straddled another insurgent who was scrambling {{to the corner of}} the room to get a rifle. Byers adjusted his night vision goggles to see whether he was the American hostage. When Joseph called out to Byers, Byers killed the insurgent he was straddling and then hurled himself on top of Joseph to protect him from harm. At the same time, Byers pinned another Taliban militant to the wall with a hand to the throat until another SEAL shot the militant.|$|R
50|$|The Supreme Court, under McLachlin, {{ruled against}} the former Conservative {{government}} of Stephen Harper on several important issues, including prostitution, assisted suicide, mandatory minimum gun crime sentences, Senate reform, whether <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighter</b> Omar Khadr deserved an adult sentence, and whether Federal Court judge Marc Nadon could be elevated to the Supreme Court.|$|R
5|$|Three <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighters</b> {{were in the}} courtyard, {{which had}} a chicken coop within it. The Taliban fired on Petry and Robinson; Petry was wounded by one round that went through both his legs, and Robinson was wounded, being hit on the armor plate {{protecting}} his side. Petry led Robinson to {{the cover of the}} chicken coop, and reported the contact and their wounded condition. Petry threw a thermobaric grenade from cover. At the chicken coop, the two men were joined by Sergeant Daniel Higgins, who assessed the wounds of the two soldiers.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Murphy's distress call, a quick reaction force team assembles, boards two CH-47 Chinook helicopters, and {{heads toward the}} location without gunship escort seeking to extract the remaining members of the reconnaissance and surveillance team. During an attempt to insert the arriving forces, the Taliban insurgents shoot {{down one of the}} helicopters, killing eight Navy SEALs and eight Special Operations aviators who were on board. The second helicopter is forced to turn back. After witnessing the attack, Luttrell and a badly injured Axelson are left behind. Axelson attempts to find cover, but is killed when he leaves his hiding spot to attack several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by the Taliban, one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, and its impact causes him to land {{at the bottom of a}} rock crevice where he is able to hide from the <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Luttrell stumbles upon a {{small body}} of water and submerges himself, only to find upon {{surfacing}} that a local Pashtun villager, Mohammad Gulab, has discovered his location. Gulab takes Luttrell into his care, returning to his village, where he attempts to hide Luttrell in his home. Gulab then sends a mountain man to the nearest American air base to alert military forces to Luttrell's location. The <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighters</b> arrive at the village to capture and kill Luttrell, but Gulab and the villagers intervene, threatening to kill the fighters if they harm Luttrell. The fighters leave, but later return to punish the villagers for protecting Luttrell. Gulab and his fellow militia are able to fend off several fighters during the ensuing attack. American forces, arriving via helicopters, shatter the advancing Taliban and, in the process, kill {{the bulk of the}} insurgents with concentrated weaponry fire. The American forces evacuate Luttrell back to base.|$|E
50|$|In Eastern Afghanistan, three NATO {{operatives}} (one of whom, Lieutenant Pruitt, is injured) trek {{through the}} desert in search of aid, the only survivors of Black Hawk Idaho Six, which had crashed while {{on a mission to}} extract the British unit Bravo One-Five. During their journey, the trio encounter a bloodied and hysterical <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighter</b> who Cooper shoots, discovering afterward that the man's firearm was damaged and empty.|$|R
2500|$|In March 2002, during Operation Anaconda, {{members of}} the 3PPCLI were in the Afghan {{province}} of Paktiya, clearing the mountains looking for Taliban and members of Al-Qaeda. The Canadian element of the operation, led by the United States, was composed of sixteen soldiers including six snipers. This sniper team, led by Master-Corporal Graham Ragsdale, registered more than 20 kills while Master-Corporal Arron Perry set the new world record for farthest combat kill with a rifle [...]50 cal McMillan Tac-50 sniper rifle that killed a <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighter</b> {{at a distance of}} [...] Later on in the mission, Corporal Rob Furlong set yet a new record by firing a shot from a [...]50 cal McMillan Tac-50 sniper rifle that killed a <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighter</b> at a distance of [...] Both shots surpassed the long-standing previous world record of [...] set by U.S. Marine Gunnery Sergeant Carlos Hathcock during the Vietnam War.

50|$|The British Army mounted bayonet charges {{during the}} Falklands War (see Battle of Mount Tumbledown), the Second Gulf War, {{and the war}} in Afghanistan. In 2004 in Iraq at the Battle of Danny Boy, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders bayonet-charged mortar {{positions}} filled with over 100 Mahdi Army members. The ensuing hand-to-hand fighting resulted in an estimate of over 40 insurgents killed and 35 bodies collected (many floated down the river) and nine prisoners. Sergeant Brian Wood, of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, was awarded the Military Cross for his part in the battle. In 2009, Lieutenant James Adamson, aged 24, of the Royal Regiment of Scotland was awarded the Military Cross for a bayonet charge whilst on a tour of duty in Afghanistan: after shooting one <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighter</b> dead Adamson had run out of ammunition when another enemy appeared. He immediately charged the second <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighter</b> and bayoneted him. In September 2012, Lance Corporal Sean Jones of The Princess of Wales's Regiment was awarded the Military Cross for his role in a bayonet charge which took place in October 2011.|$|R
5|$|The film shows Luttrell (Wahlberg) {{being able}} to walk after the Taliban's ambush on the four-man SEAL team. In reality, Luttrell {{explained}} that his legs were numb immediately after the ambush, and when feeling did return to them, the pain from the shrapnel in his legs made it too painful to walk; he had to crawl seven miles looking for water and sanctuary. Luttrell {{also said that he}} did not witness the MH-47 Chinook helicopter being shot down, as seen in the film. At the end of the film, the Pashtun villagers fight off a Taliban attack in a firefight that never actually happened. In reality, the <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighters</b> were outnumbered by the villagers and had no intentions of attacking the village. They did, however, try to sneak in and capture Luttrell in secret. Luttrell also did not go into cardiac arrest after he was rescued, nor was he near death, as seen in the film.|$|E
5|$|A 300-strong Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) was {{subsequently}} deployed {{to support the}} Reconstruction Taskforce in April 2007, including a commando company group, elements of the SASR, and an integral combat service support team. In {{the latter part of}} 2008 the commando company conducted a disruption operation in Helmand province as part of Operation Eagle's Summit, which was a major coalition operation conducted in support of the transport and installation of an additional turbine for the Kajaki Dam hydroelectric facility. In March and April 2009, SOTG killed 80 <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighters</b> in a major four-week operation in Helmand Province, without suffering any casualties. Further operations undertaken include the Battle of Gizab in April 2010, and the Shah Wali Kot Offensive in June 2010, which resulted in heavy insurgent casualties. The bulk of SOTG was withdrawn from Afghanistan in late 2013 as part of a drawdown of Australian forces, although some special forces remained after this date as part of the small Australian force maintained in the country. The Regiment lost 12 personnel killed while deployed to Afghanistan, along with one killed during a pre-deployment exercise.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three hours of the fight, the U.S. troops {{remained}} under intense mortar and small arms fire, before the <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighters</b> breached the compound and set fire to it. Romesha moved under heavy fire to reconnoiter the area and seek reinforcements from a nearby barracks, helping the ISAF force to regroup and fight despite being targeted by a Taliban sniper. Romesha led the firefight to reclaim the depot, organizing a five-man team to counterattack while still under fire. He then neutralized one of the Taliban fighters' machine gun teams. While engaging a second, he took cover behind a generator which {{was struck by a}} rocket propelled grenade, and Romesha was wounded in the neck, shoulder and arms by shrapnel. Despite being wounded, Romesha directed air support that killed an estimated 30 Taliban and then took out several more Taliban positions himself. He provided suppressive fire to allow three other wounded American soldiers to reach an aid station and then recovered several American casualties while still under fire. Romesha's efforts allowed the troop to regroup and fight off a force superior in numbers. The fight lasted 12 hours, and eight American soldiers were killed, making the engagement one of the costliest for ISAF forces during the war. Nine soldiers were decorated with Silver Star Medals for the fight. Several days later, the ISAF forces withdrew from the post.|$|E

A <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighter</b> threw another grenade, which landed {{a few feet from}} Higgins and Robinson. Knowing the risk, Petry picked up and attempted to throw the grenade {{in the direction of the}} Taliban. Petry later recalled his immediate reaction was [...] "get it out of here, get it away from the guys and myself. And I reached over, leaned over to the right, grabbed it with my hand, and I threw it as hard as I could, what I thought was at the time. And as soon as I opened my hand to let it go, it just exploded instantly. And I came back, and the hand was completely severed off."The detonation amputated his right hand, and sprayed his body with shrapnel. Petry likely saved the two other soldiers from serious injury or death.|$|R
50|$|Back at base {{the patrol}} members congratulate {{each other on}} the morning's work and there is a {{debriefing}} with accounts of at least one <b>Taliban</b> <b>fighter</b> supposedly found alive but severely wounded in the ditch. There are further insinuations that any movement within the ditch would have represented a possible threat and that it was thus deemed necessary to spray the enemy fighters with another volley of bullets just to be sure.|$|R
40|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on 6 August 2011, a Chinook {{helicopter}} carrying NATO and Afghan security forces {{was preparing to}} land near the Tangi Valley in Afghanistan.
