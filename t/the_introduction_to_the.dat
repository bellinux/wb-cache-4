5|$|Pielke {{praised the}} final scene of the sketch as evocative of the {{original}} series and an indictment of capitalism. He wrote that Belushi finished off the sketch with a moving rendition of <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original Star Trek series, while modifying it slightly to emphasize that NBC's greed had ended the Enterprise mission.|$|E
5|$|Although Robert {{condemned}} Gilbert Porrée {{in conjunction}} with Peter Lombard, he {{did not agree with}} Lombard's Christology, or views on the nature of Jesus Christ. Likewise, although he disagreed with some of Abelard's teachings, he defended Abelard against charges of heresy. Robert did, however, agree with some of Abelard's teachings and methods. <b>The</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sententiae proclaims Robert's desire to harmonise the writings of two unnamed scholars, who have been identified by modern writers as Hugh of St Victor and Abelard.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} {{stories of the}} birth of The Satanic Bible. In <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2005–present edition, High Priest Peter H. Gilmore describes LaVey as having compiled The Satanic Bible on his own from monographs he had written about the Church of Satan and its rituals. Gilmore lists {{a number of people who}} influenced LaVey's writings: Ayn Rand, Friedrich Nietzsche, H. L. Mencken, the members of the carnival with whom LaVey had supposedly worked in his youth, P. T. Barnum, Mark Twain, John Milton, and Lord Byron.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, {{he wrote}} and {{published}} privately a pamphlet This is the World that Man Made, or The New Creation that {{was influenced by the}} rationalist writing of Ray Lankester. In it Pick was pessimistic that mankind was not achieving its creative potential. He returned to the subject in lectures he gave in the 1930s when he outlined his concern that at some not too distant point progress in civilisation would come to a natural end and a stable condition would arise where, he believed, {{it would be hard to}} maintain creativity and an entropic decline would follow. Later, in the last year of his life and with the Second World War under way, he published two booklets on post war reconstruction, Britain Must Rebuild and Paths to Peace. Pick wrote <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English translation of Walter Gropius's The New Architecture and the Bauhaus published in 1935.|$|E
5|$|With {{the rise}} of the {{movement}} to give women a political voice, Wollstonecraft's work was exhumed. The first full-length biography, by Elizabeth Robins Pennell, appeared in 1884 as part of a series by the Roberts Brothers on famous women. This followed an attempt at rehabilitation in 1879, with the publication of Wollstonecraft's Letters to Imlay, with prefatory memoir by Charles Kegan Paul. Millicent Garrett Fawcett, a suffragist and later president of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, wrote <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> centenary edition (i.e. 1892) of the Rights of Woman, cleansing the memory of Wollstonecraft and claiming her as the foremother of the struggle for the vote. As early as 1898, Wollstonecraft {{was the subject of a}} doctoral thesis and its resulting book.|$|E

25|$|In {{the novel}} 1985 (1978), Anthony Burgess {{suggests}} that Orwell, disillusioned by {{the onset of}} the Cold War (1945–91), intended to call the book 1948. <b>The</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Penguin Books Modern Classics edition of Nineteen Eighty-Four reports that Orwell originally set the novel in 1980 but that he later shifted the date to 1982 and then to 1984. <b>The</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Houghton Mifflin Harcourt edition of Animal Farm and 1984 (2003) reports that the title 1984 was chosen simply as an inversion of the year 1948, the year in which it was being completed, and that the date was meant to give an immediacy and urgency to the menace of totalitarian rule.|$|E
