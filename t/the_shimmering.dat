Both novels are written by Gail Herman, and contain original stories about Ariel's life as a human and Eric's wife, but still maintaining close relationships with her father and sisters under the sea. The franchise also includes illustrated short stories about Ariel's life as a human, such as Ariel and the Aquamarine Jewel, Ariel's Dolphin Adventure, and Ariel's Royal Wedding.

The protein fiber of silk is {{composed}} mainly of fibroin and is produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons. The best-known silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity (sericulture). <b>The</b> <b>shimmering</b> appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors.|$|E

500|$|The game {{received}} very {{mixed reviews}} from gaming publications. The Japanese magazine Weekly Famitsu gave the title {{a score of}} 28 out of 40, praising its graphics, usage of real cars and innovative driver's view perspective. The American magazine Game Informer and website GameZone also lauded the game's realistic car interiors and highly detailed environments, putting them on par with those of Ridge Racer V and Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec. Still, Allgame noted {{the presence of a}} subtle shimmering effect in the graphics, an effect typically seen on early PlayStation 2 titles, while the American website Game Revolution found the graphics [...] "severely jagged". <b>The</b> <b>shimmering</b> and jaggedness were also noted by GameSpot and the American website IGN, which did not feel they were that irritating.|$|E

[...] The IGN review observed that the visuals and audio surpass many side quests of the main game. Critics also highlighted very positively the story.

500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the Entertainment Weekly {{review of the}} album, critic David Browne wrote: [...] "Songs like 'In My Place' and 'Warning Sign' marry lyrics imbued with deep regret and mistakes (...You were an island / And I passed you by in the touching latter song) with lyrical melodies and guitar hooks that twinkle and sparkle." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: [...] "When <b>the</b> <b>shimmering,</b> pretty lead-off single 'In My Place' represents the album's weakest moment, you know you've got something extraordinary. Currently storming the charts a la 'Yellow', 'In My Place' is another surprisingly simple song, carried by Jonny Buckland's chiming guitar and Chris Martin’s heartfelt vocals. It really shouldn't amount to much, but Coldplay make it work very well. When Martin sings, [...] "Please, please, please/Come back and sing to me," [...] he totally sells it, and you buy it. And why not? The song's lovely.|$|E
500|$|The {{cinematic}} experience {{itself is}} {{the main focus of}} the film, {{but there is also a}} central theme of emptiness. Noé describes the film's subject as [...] "the sentimentality of mammals and <b>the</b> <b>shimmering</b> vacuity of the human experience." [...] The dramaturgy after Oscar has been shot is loosely based on The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and ends with the spirit's search for a way to reincarnate. The director, who opposes all religious beliefs, says that [...] "the whole movie is a dream of someone who read The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and heard about it before being [...] It's not the story of someone who dies, flies and is reincarnated, it's the story of someone who is stoned when he gets shot and who has an intonation of his own dream." [...] Noé describes the ending of the film as Oscar's recollection of [...] "the most traumatic moment of his life – his own birth". The director also leaves open the possibility that Oscar's life starts over again in an endless loop, due to the human brain's perception of time.|$|E

2500|$|The ballet was premiered by the Ballets Russes in Paris on 25 June 1910, {{conducted}} by Gabriel Pierné. Even {{before the first}} performance, the company sensed a huge success in the making, and every performance of the ballet in that first production, as Karsavina recalled, met a [...] "crescendo" [...] of success. The critics were ecstatic, praising the ballet for {{what they saw as}} an ideal symbiosis between decor, choreography and music: [...] "The old-gold vermiculation of the fantastic back-cloth seems to have been invented to a formula identical with that of <b>the</b> <b>shimmering</b> web of the orchestra" [...] enthused Henri Ghéon in Nouvelle revue française (1910).

By the end of the trial year he had sung at the Hoftheater at 30 evenings or masterclasses: an unparalleled success. Soon afterwards, at von Putlitz's urging, Erb took singing lessons from Felix Decken, a tenorbuffo, who tried to break and rebuild his technique. Erb, deeply undermined, sacked him and nearly broke with von Putlitz, but instead they agreed that he pass the winter season 1908 as leading lyric tenor for the brand new Theatre at Lübeck.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to 1914, {{travel from}} [...] Tampa, Florida, to St. Petersburg, {{located on a}} then-isolated peninsula, {{required}} a slow steamboat trip across Tampa Bay or a circuitous, five-hour journey by railroad. A bumpy automobile or horse and buggy ride took many hours over primitive, unpaved roads. The airplane {{at the time was}} a rare novelty, lacking any practical application. Impressed by the record-setting overwater flight made by Jannus in 1912, Florida businessman Percival Fansler approached some St. Petersburg businessmen the next year with a proposal to use Benoist flying boats for [...] "a real commercial line" [...] over open water between the two cities. Convinced by Fansler's plan, several St. Petersburg community leaders, led by L. A. Whitney of the local chamber of commerce and Noel Mitchell, agreed to provide financial support for the creation of an airline service to connect the two cities. A 90-day contract with Benoist was signed on December 17, 1913 (the 10th anniversary of Wilbur and Orville Wright's historic first airplane flight), to provide airplanes and crew for two daily round trips across Tampa Bay, dubbed the St. Petersburg–Tampa Airboat Line [...] the world's first scheduled airline. [...] Fansler told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "The St. Petersburg waterfront is an ideal place for starting and landing as the trip to and from Tampa {{will be one of the}} most beautiful in the country. Skimming a few feet above the surface of the water... with the purr of a 75h.p. engine and the whirring of a propeller turning several hundred times a minute, the rush of the cool salt air and <b>the</b> <b>shimmering</b> sunlight on Tampa Bay [...] no trip could be more enjoyable.".|$|E
2500|$|As {{a patron}} entered the front doors, {{he would have}} {{found himself in a}} lobby with two {{stairwells}} leading up to the balcony, a manager's office, and a smoking room. [...] Upon stepping through the terracotta leather covered and gold trimmed wooden doors into the auditorium, a patron would have been softly bathed in <b>the</b> <b>shimmering</b> glow of 94 gas lights. [...] These lights, were crafted of polished brass and fitted with etched glass globes. [...] The stage itself was equipped with 174 gas lights. [...] All the lights in the entire theatre were controlled from the stage by means of a pipe system, allowing the stage manager to ignite or extinguish any or all of these brilliant lights in an instant. [...] Beneath a dome resplendent with painted cherubs, a large chandelier, known as an [...] "Opal glass reflector", scattered sparkles of reflected light over all. [...] Elegant red Brussels' carpet softened patrons' steps, and grand opera chairs, upholstered in dark Cardinal plush awaited to seat them. [...] These chairs were engraved with the monogram, B.S.T., Barton Tibbits' initials, and many of these chairs offered foot rests and hat and umbrella racks. [...] Amazingly the auditorium originally held 1,000 seats for patrons. [...] The seating area was divided into the parquet and the parquet circle – two separate areas {{on the floor in front}} of the orchestra pit. [...] The walls of the auditorium, colored in cameo tints and dashes of cardinal, green, and gold color in [...] "conventional figures" [...] produced [...] "a warm, sunny effect and [...] the auditorium a bright and airy appearance which is very pleasing."
