5|$|Because {{they are}} members of the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the {{question}} of whether clubs like Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused long-running discussions in UEFA. Swansea <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> England's three available places in the Europa League in 2013–14 by winning the League Cup in 2012–13. The right of Welsh clubs to take up such English places was in doubt until UEFA clarified the matter in March 2012, allowing them to participate.|$|E

5|$|Diego Velázquez, the {{governor}} of Cuba, was enthused by Hernández de Córdoba's report of gold in Yucatán. He organised a new expedition consisting of four ships and 260 men. He placed his nephew Juan de Grijalva in command.

Bernal Díaz del Castillo served on the crew; he was able to secure a place on the expedition as a favour from {{the governor}}, who was his kinsman. Antón de Alaminos once again served as pilot. Governor Velázquez provided all four ships, in an attempt to protect his claim over the peninsula. The small fleet was stocked with crossbows, muskets, barter goods, salted pork and cassava bread. Grijalva also <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the captured Indians from the Hernández expedition.|$|E

Greeley <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the first stagecoaches to Denver, seeing the town then in course of formation as a mining camp of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Sending dispatches back to be published in the Tribune, Greeley took the Overland Trail, reaching Salt Lake City, where he conducted a two-hour interview with the Mormon leader, Brigham Young, the first newspaper interview Young had given. Greeley encountered Native Americans, and was sympathetic, but like many of his time, deemed Indian culture inferior. In California, he explored widely and gave many addresses.|$|E

25|$|In AREDS2, {{participants}} <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> four AREDS formulations: {{the original}} AREDS formulation, AREDS formulation with no beta-carotene, AREDS with low zinc, AREDS with no beta-carotene and low zinc. In addition, they <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> four additional supplement or combinations including lutein and zeaxanthin (10mg and 2mg), {{omega-3 fatty acids}} (1,000mg), lutein/zeaxanthin and omega-3 fatty acids, or placebo. The study reported {{that there was no}} overall additional benefit from adding omega-3 fatty acids or lutein and zeaxanthin to the formulation. However, the study did find benefits in two subgroups of participants: those not given beta-carotene, and those who had little lutein and zeaxanthin in their diets. Removing beta-carotene did not curb the formulation's protective effect against developing advanced AMD, which was important given that high doses of beta-carotene had been linked to higher risk of lung cancers in smokers. It was recommended to replace beta-carotene with lutein and zeaxanthin in future formulations for these reasons.|$|E
