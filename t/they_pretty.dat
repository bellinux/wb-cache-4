500|$|The {{theme of}} the episode—love songs—inspired VanDerWerff to note that such songs [...] "are great for musicals because <b>they</b> <b>pretty</b> much {{do all of the}} work {{necessary}} in terms of expressing inner emotions and moving the plot forward". He said that [...] "every song in this episode had a clear emotional and plot purpose" [...] except for the [...] "Love Shack" [...] finale. Futterman wrote that the glee club succeeded in finding and performing [...] "the world's greatest love songs", and the reactions from other reviewers were generally favorable as well.|$|E
500|$|First season regular {{cast member}} Malcolm David Kelley {{returned}} in an uncredited cameo {{for a single}} scene as Michael's ten-year-old son Walt without dialogue and from a distance. Fifteen-year-old Kelley claimed that make-up was applied to him in an effort for him to look younger; however, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse clarified that visual effects supervisor Mitch Suskin had actually composited into the shot some footage of Kelley from production on the first season. Because Kelley was so obscured and his name did {{not appear in the}} cast list, television critics were convinced that Walt had been recast. Steve Heisler of Time Out stated that [...] "You gotta hand it to the Lost writers: For weeks, people have speculated about how they were going to treat Walt's inevitable pubescence. See, the show's set in 2004, and only a few months have passed since the plane crash. Yet … it's been years, and … Kelley has become a man. So what did they do? … They just didn't show him. Clever." [...] TMZ's Daniel thought that [...] "Not showing Walt is a clever way to cover up the fact that he [...] a foot taller than he should be … I understand that <b>they</b> <b>pretty</b> much can't show Walt ever again". Wizards Nikki Stafford {{went so far as to}} remark that [...] "That kid standing in the window was definitely not Malcolm David Kelley … I don't think Kelley will be back to reprise the role." ...|$|E
2500|$|Public {{schools are}} {{generally}} limited to students living {{within the school}} district boundaries. Private schools can enroll students regardless of where they live. A common misconception about Bolles is that they recruit and their teams are composed of blue-chip college prospects. They usually aren’t, so Rogers must maximize the potential of players with no chance of ever playing college ball. Rogers stated, [...] "As coaches, we don't {{do a lot to}} make Division I football players; <b>they</b> <b>pretty</b> much make themselves. Where we come in is to have more influence on the guy who struggles just to be competitive." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Yankees {{organization}} {{did work}} closely with the Creatures to ensure that they sat together again, and designated a total of 136 season-ticket packages for them in section 203. The move was monitored by long-time Creature Teena Lewis, known as the [...] "Queen of the Bleachers", and Marc Chalpin, who organized a list of about 50+ Creatures to ensure they would all be sitting together again in the new stadium. Despite the Creatures' concerns over how the Yankees management would handle the move, Lewis said that, [...] "The Yankees helped us because I calmed everybody down over the years. We behaved ourselves, took away some of the chants, and <b>they</b> <b>pretty</b> much paid us back." ...|$|E
2500|$|The idea of {{the cover}} was Siouxsie's. Photographer Paul Wakefield met her and the band to discuss the project: [...] "The idea was to shoot disquieting and unnerving images {{underwater}} {{in a swimming pool}} – you can’t scream underwater. I {{wanted to be able to}} completely control the lighting, and so an indoor pool was the only option. I scouted quite a few pools, but when I saw this pool in the YMCA in Central London, which was dark blue tiled with light blue lane stripes instead of the normal reverse colors, I knew it was the ideal location. I wanted to give it an eerie underwater night-time feel, and this setting was perfect. We used a number of 1000K and 2000K lights around the pool edge. I used school kids as models and <b>they</b> <b>pretty</b> well ran riot." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I just couldn't {{believe there}} was no flag", Clark said after the game, in {{reference}} to Davis' contact with him. [...] "I mean, I just assumed it would be thrown. When I heard the crowd cheering, I gave the ref an earful. I'm not saying that cost us the game. I don't think any of the calls would have changed anything because the 49ers have a better team. But there were some calls out there we should have had." [...] "I'm not going {{to walk out of}} here crying", Redskins coach Joe Gibbs added. [...] "We got beat fair and square. I did think there were some things called wrong. Rice outweighs Darrell Green by 20 pounds and gets 15 yards (for Green's flinging tackle). That's hard to understand." [...] Rypien added [...] "I don't think the score was any indication of how the game was played. We have nothing to be ashamed about other than the score. You look at 28-10 and it looks like <b>they</b> <b>pretty</b> much handled us, but all of you that watched the game know that it's a different story. We had our chances. We had our shots. We just didn't make the plays we had to." ...|$|E

6000|$|We had further {{trouble with}} this individual, who {{continually}} lamented {{he had ever}} come to a country wherein there was no beer, and derided his Ontario comrade for doing too much. The longer a job lasted the better for those employed on it {{and the rest of}} the profession, he said: to which, as we heard later, the Ontario man replied: [...] "If the job lasts too long in this country <b>they</b> <b>pretty</b> well fire you out of it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Dogging me!" [...] {{said the}} seaman. [...] "Dogging’s no word for it. Wherever I’ve been they’ve been my shadders. They {{want to hurt}} me, but they’re careful about being hurt themselves. That’s where I have the pull of them. They want the stone back first, and revenge afterwards, so I thought I’d put you on your guard, for <b>they</b> <b>pretty</b> well guess who’s got the thing now. You’ll know Wheeler by his nose, which is broken." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{would appear}} that the Leaphighers, while they obey only the king's eldest first cousin of the {{masculine}} gender, perform all their official acts {{in the name of the}} sovereign himself, for whose person and character <b>they</b> <b>pretty</b> uniformly express the profoundest veneration; just as we men express admiration for a virtue that we never practise. My declaration, therefore, produced a strong sensation, and I was soon required to explain myself. This I did, by simply stating the truth.|$|E

6000|$|Meantime, he {{must show}} the {{beautiful}} American ducks which {{he hoped to}} naturalize on the pond near the keeper's lodge: but, whistle and call as he would, nothing showed itself but screaming Canada geese. He ran round, pulled out a boat half full of water, and, with a foot on each side, paddled across to a bushy island in the centre,--but in vain. The keeper's wife, who had the charge over them, came out: 'Oh, my Lord, I am so sorry! <b>They</b> <b>pretty</b> ducks!' ...|$|E
