5|$|An amphibious {{landing at}} Mersing was {{originally}} planned by the Japanese to sever {{the lines of}} communication between the British forces and Singapore, but the Southern Expeditionary Army Group decided to land the rest of the 18th Division at Singora instead, believing that the Allied defences at Mersing were too formidable. Although ground forces captured Endau on 21 January, <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> the strength to break through the Australian defences at Sungei-Mersing.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defence, it doubled the number of police personnel to about 20,000. The most effective part of the police force was the 3,000-strong special police, which was deployed in twelve military-style battalions. In addition, Croatia had 9,000–10,000 regionally organised reserve police officers organised in 16 battalions and 10 companies, but <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> weapons.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Permian, {{increasing}} aridity and the {{diversification of}} reptiles contributed into {{a decline in}} terrestrial temnospondyls, but semiaquatic and fully aquatic temnospondyls continued to flourish, including the large Melosaurus of Eastern Europe. Other temnospondyls, such as archegosaurids, developed long snouts and a close similarity to crocodiles, although <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> the armor characteristic of the latter group. These temnospondyls included the largest known batrachomorph, the 9-m-long Prionosuchus of Brazil.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{industrial}} unrest, trade unions for black workers were instituted in 1946, though <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> power and influence. Workers at the UMHK continued to demand higher wages, and strikes were {{common in the}} colony for the next decade. Nevertheless, both wages and living conditions improved significantly {{in the years after}} the war. The war began a second wave of industrialisation that lasted right up to Congolese independence in 1960.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarian {{high command}} {{did not attempt}} to perform a spoiling attack as <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> the {{necessary}} vehicles and pack animals. The barrage did not cause a significant number of casualties but severely affected the Bulgarian esprit de corps. On the night between 14 and 15 September, Franco-Serbian patrols reported that the artillery barrage had dealt sufficient damage to the barbed wire entanglements separating the trenches.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavated}} grave-goods of the Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Gipeswic, {{including those}} found in burials under small barrows, were not particularly wealthy or elaborate. <b>They</b> <b>lacked</b> the strong characterization of a neighbouring late 6th century cemetery at a higher crossing of the river. One exception was a furnished grave {{that it has been}} suggested could have been that of a visitor from the Rhineland.|$|E
5000|$|The {{strawberry}} anemone grows {{no larger}} than 2.5 centimeters. The anemone is always bright red with transparent to white tentacles that are bulbous at the tips. The strawberry anemone resembles sea anemones in that <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> a calcareous skeleton, but are closer related to stony corals in that <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> basilar muscles.|$|R

5|$|Between January 2010 and 2015, {{a quarter}} of {{emergency}} room doctors said they had seen a major surge in patients, while nearly half had seen a smaller increase. Seven in ten ER doctors claimed that <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> the resources to deal with large increases {{in the number of}} patients. The biggest factor in the increased number of ER patients was insufficient primary care providers to handle the larger number of insured patients.|$|E
5|$|By 1474, cannons {{had been}} {{introduced}} in Mdina. Other extensive preparations for an attack {{were made in the}} 1480s, when the fortifications were once again improved under the direction of Sicilian military engineers. At this point, some buildings in Rabat were demolished to clear the fortifications' line of fire. By 1522, the fortifications were being modernized with the construction of embrasures. However, the walls were still regarded as obsolete, since <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> bastions and could not resist bombardment from modern artillery.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defence, Croatia doubled {{the size of its}} police force to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was the 3,000-strong special police that were deployed in 12 battalions adopting military organisation. In addition there were 9,000–10,000 regionally organised reserve police. The reserve police were set up in 16 battalions and 10 companies, but <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> weapons.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the earlier}} scout cruisers, the Boadicea class was {{designed}} to provide destroyer flotillas with a command ship, theoretically offering the ability to scout ahead {{of the group and}} locate targets for the smaller ships to attack. They were enlarged and more powerfully armed versions of the earlier ships, fitted with steam turbines. Curiously, they were no faster than the older ships and equally unsuccessful in their intended role as <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> the speed of the destroyers they were supposed to escort.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 1862, the Confederate Navy {{initiated}} the first combat between ironclads when the Virginia successfully attacked the blockade. The next day, the Monitor engaged the Virginia in the Battle of Hampton Roads. Their battle {{ended in a}} draw, and the Confederacy later lost the Virginia when the ship was scuttled to prevent capture. The Monitor was the prototype for the monitor warship and many more were built by the Union Navy. While the Confederacy built more ironclad ships during the war, <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> the ability to build or purchase ships that could effectively counter the monitors.|$|E

5|$|President Richard Nixon {{reestablished}} the AMSA {{program after}} taking office, keeping with his administration's flexible response strategy {{that required a}} broad range of options short of general nuclear war. Nixon's Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird, reviewed the programs and decided to lower the numbers of FB-111s, since <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> the desired range, and recommended that the AMSA design studies be accelerated. In April 1969, the program officially became the B-1A. This was the first entry in the new bomber designation series, first created in 1962. The Air Force issued a request for proposals in November 1969.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarians, who by 922 were {{in control}} {{of most of the}} Balkans, {{continued}} to ravage the Byzantine countryside virtually unopposed. However, <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> the maritime power to conduct a successful siege of Constantinople. The subsequent attempts to negotiate a Bulgarian–Arab alliance for a joint assault of Constantinople were discovered by the Byzantines and successfully countered. The strategic situation in the Balkans remained unchanged until both sides signed a peace treaty in 927, which recognized the imperial title of the Bulgarian monarchs and the complete independence of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as an autocephalous Patriarchate.|$|E
5|$|The Una-class {{submarine}} (also {{known as}} Type 911) was {{a class of}} six midget submarines built for the Yugoslav Navy at the Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata (English: Special objects shipyard) during the 1980s. They were designed {{with the purpose of}} laying small minefields and transporting naval special forces, with or without their submersibles, in shallow waters that were inaccessible for larger submarines. Due to their mission profile that called for a small design as well as the need to stay undetected, <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> torpedo armament and a generator for battery recharging.|$|E
50|$|The Petropedetidae {{differ from}} Odontobatrachus in several ways, {{including}} that <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> tusks on the mandibles and that <b>they</b> either <b>lack</b> vocal sacs, or, {{if they have}} one it is median; Odontobatrachus has lateral vocal sacs.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "bryophyte" [...] thus {{refers to}} a grade of {{lineages}} defined primarily by what <b>they</b> <b>lack.</b> Compared to other living land plants, <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> vascular tissue containing lignin and branched sporophytes bearing multiple sporangia. The prominence of the gametophyte in the life cycle is also a shared feature of the three bryophyte lineages (extant vascular plants are all sporophyte dominant).|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{organisms that}} can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. Although <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed {{them to be more}} agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.|$|E
5|$|The {{pursuit of}} full {{dominion}} status was then regarded {{as something of}} a non-issue by most Southern Rhodesian politicians. They viewed themselves as virtually independent already; <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> only the foreign affairs portfolio and taking this on would mean having to shoulder the expense for high commissions and embassies overseas. Huggins and the United Party instead pursued an initially semi-independent Federation with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, two protectorates directly administered from London, with the hope of ultimately creating a single, united dominion in south-central Africa.|$|E
5|$|The series {{moved to}} the Polo Grounds for game two. Sheldon Jones took the mound for the Giants despite a 6–10 record going into the game, {{allowing}} the Giants to save Sal Maglie for the series' game three or {{the first game of}} the World Series. The Dodgers used Clem Labine, a rookie who had started just six games for the Dodgers in his career, because <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> pitchers who were ready for the game. The Yankees were among those in attendance as spectators.|$|E
