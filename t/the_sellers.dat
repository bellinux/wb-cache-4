5|$|In {{accordance}} with changes {{made for the}} 1924 final onwards, all tickets were sold in advance to prevent {{a repeat of the}} overcrowding at the 1923 final. Approximately 91,000 tickets were available. 53,000 were standing tickets, 15,000 were uncovered seats and 23,000 were covered seats. Standing tickets cost two shillings, seat prices ranged from five shillings to one guinea. The majority of tickets were sold before the finalists were known. As a result, few supporters of the participating teams attended; most were unable to afford the remaining tickets available to the general public, which were typically in the more expensive areas of the stadium. 1,750 tickets were allocated directly to each club. Bolton fielded 6,000 enquiries and lodged a formal protest about the inadequacy of their allocation. The London, Midland and Scottish Railway laid on a total of seven special trains from Manchester to London on the eve and morning of the match. A number of supporters travelled to London without tickets in the hope of securing one outside the stadium. 5s tickets changed hands for up to 15s, provoking the ire of ticketless supporters who accused <b>the</b> <b>sellers</b> of profiteering. In one such instance, a man selling twenty 2s tic|kets at 10s each required the assistance of five police officers to escape the wrath of the crowd. The total gate receipts for the match were £23,157, a new record.|$|E

40|$|A {{real estate}} {{developer}} sells a recently constructed office building to a public real estate "blind pool " syndication. Because the property is not yet fully occupied, the general partner of the syndication negotiates a master leaseback agreement with <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> at <b>the</b> date of the sale. Under {{the terms of the}} agreement, the syndication pays a fee to <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> and <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> leases <b>the</b> vacant space at a market rate, at the sale date, for a two-year period. This payment is described as a fee in exchange for signing a master lease or as an escrowed portion of the purchase price. The syndication will relieve <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> of its future lease payment obligations on space <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> subsequently subleases to others if the sublease meets certain criteria. If <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> is unable to lease the vacant space during the two-year period, the rental payments to the syndication would substantially exceed the fee paid by the syndication.

EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that payments to and receipts from <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> should be treated by the syndication as adjustments to the basis of the property and will affect future depreciation.

25|$|Finally, the {{question}} may be raised: Are corporations themselves mere grants of monopoly privilege? Some {{advocates of the}} free market were persuaded to accept this view by Walter Lippmann's The Good Society. It should be clear from previous discussion, however, that corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such individuals would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation, and that beyond this their personal funds are not liable for debts, as they would be under a partnership arrangement. It then rests with <b>the</b> <b>sellers</b> and lenders to this corporation {{to decide whether or not}} they will transact business with it. If they do, then they proceed at their own risk. Thus, the government does not grant corporations a privilege of limited liability; anything announced and freely contracted for in advance is a right of a free individual, not a special privilege. It is not necessary that governments grant charters to corporations.|$|E
25|$|Folklore {{is one of}} {{the central}} subject in the poetry of Naidu. In The Bazaars of Hyderabad is {{associated}} with one such subject, the charm and enthusiasm of a traditional Indian bazaar in the city of Hyderabad is presented in this poem. Naidu had enthusiastically described the Bazaar with merchants and vendors selling diverse range of wares. The poet stops over at the galleries arranged by the merchants, traders, hawkers, goldsmiths, fruit sellers, peddlers,magicians,musicians and flower girls. The poet describes the experience of conversation between the seller and the buyer, here the poet questions <b>the</b> <b>sellers</b> about what they are selling and who in turn politely answer while explaining their products. Emotional moods are stirred by the poet, when Naidu makes the readers feel that the bazaar life also witnesses both sorrows and joys. Wedding and festival occasions brings joy in the Bazaar’s life when people buy jewellery, garlands, fruits and children crowding near the magicians. The sorrow and sadness is witnessed when common public kitchens are arranged when the nobles or soldiers die and when flower girls are seen weaving masses of white flowers to be used for the dead people’s grave.|$|E

500|$|From the 1930s, Sungei Road and its {{surrounding}} roads became a flea market {{better known as the}} Thieves' Market, because all sorts of second-hand merchandise as well as contraband goods were sold here. The peddlers may change from day to day and there were no receipts, so refunds are impossible. Until the British Army withdrawal in the late 1960s, it was also a place to buy army merchandise like uniforms, army gear and other army surplus, possibly looted earlier from British military stores. The open-air market soon acquired a bad reputation as the major dissemination venue for stolen goods that would last to the present day.

In the kidnap sequence, Tremble's death is also very abruptly inserted; it consists of pre-existing footage of Tremble being rescued by Vesper, followed by a later-filmed shot of her abruptly deciding to shoot him, followed by a freeze-frame over some of the previous footage of her surrounded by bodies (noticeably a zoom-in on the previous shot).|$|E

Although Bill Sellers was Protestant and Peg was Jewish, Sellers {{attended}} the North London Roman Catholic school St. Aloysius College, run by the Brothers of Our Lady of Mercy. The family was not rich, but Peg insisted on an expensive private schooling for her son. According to biographer Peter Evans, Sellers was fascinated, puzzled, and worried by religion from a young age, particularly Catholicism, while Roger Lewis believed that soon after entering Catholic school, Sellers [...] "discovered he was a Jew—he was someone {{on the outside of}} the mysteries of faith". Later in his life, Sellers observed that while his father's faith was according to the Church of England, his mother was Jewish, [...] "and Jews take the faith of their mother." [...] According to Milligan, Sellers held a guilt complex about being Jewish and recalls that Sellers was once reduced to tears when he presented him with a candlestick from a synagogue for Christmas, believing the gesture to be an anti-Jewish slur.|$|E
500|$|Vermont Representative Frederick G. Fleetwood {{addressed}} the committee.

Vestal and others supported a ban on the committee passing further commemorative coin bills, but wanted the Vermont bill to pass. [...] For one thing, as Massachusetts' Robert M. Leach noted, President Calvin Coolidge was a Vermonter by birth. The Treasury officials were willing to support striking a medal rather than a coin, but as Illinois' Morton D. Hull pointed out, <b>the</b> <b>sellers</b> preferred a coin that could be spent if there was an unsold surplus, over a medal that could not. Leach's attitude toward approving more commemorative coins was typical: [...] "I believe we have been going too fast, and I believe at some time we ought to quit it, but I dislike quitting on these gentlemen representing the State of Vermont this morning." [...] Vestal issued a report the same day, stating that the committee was against more commemorative coin issues, but that the Bennington issue should pass because of the national importance of the events of 1777, and because the issue of 40,000 was relatively small.|$|E
