5|$|Both {{species may}} be {{affected}} by poor weather. Breeding colonies of Brazza's martins in river sandbars are liable to flooding, {{but this does not}} appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> serious impact, and this species appears to be under no immediate threat. Its ability to use degraded habitats also aids its survival. Tropical cyclones present a threat to the Mascarene martin, particularly on the small islands inhabited by the nominate subspecies. The populations on Mauritius and Réunion were badly affected by a six-day cyclone in February 1861, taking many years to recover, but by about 1900 it was reported to be common but local, and in 1973–74 there were 200–400 pairs on Réunion and 70–75 pairs in Mauritius. More recent cyclones, like one in 1980, seem to have had less damaging effects than the 1861 storm. Several species have been lost from the Mascarene islands since human colonisation in the seventeenth century, but the martin and the Mascarene swiftlet occur on all the main islands, and are less vulnerable to the effects of human activities, especially since they can utilise houses for nest sites.|$|E

Nevertheless, during high school, he always received a perfect grade in conduct.|$|E
25|$|Tamil United Liberation Front leader Appapillai Amirthalingam, {{who was in}} 1977 {{elected as}} the Opposition leader of Sri Lanka Parliament, clandestinely {{supported}} the LTTE. Amirthalingam believed {{that if he could}} exercise control over the Tamil insurgent groups, it would enhance his political position and pressure the government to agree to grant political autonomy to Tamils. Thus, he provided letters of reference to the LTTE and to other Tamil insurgent groups to raise funds. Both Uma Maheswaran (a former surveyor) and Urmila Kandiah, first female member of the LTTE, were prominent members of the TULF youth wing. Maheswaran was the secretary of TULF Tamil Youth Forum, Colombo branch. Amirthalingam introduced Prabhakaran to N. S. Krishnan, who later became the first international representative of LTTE. It was Krishnan who introduced Prabhakaran to Anton Balasingham, who later became the chief political strategist and chief negotiator of LTTE, which split {{for the first time in}} 1979. Uma Maheswaran was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> love affair with Urmila Kandiah, which was against the code of conduct of LTTE. Prabhakaran ordered him to leave the organisation. Uma Maheswaran left LTTE and formed People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) in 1980.|$|E

500|$|In August that year, Harrison {{set off for}} {{a driving}} holiday around Europe without Boyd, a trip that Huntley {{describes}} as [...] "the first publicly visible signs" [...] of problems in the Harrisons' marriage. While in Portugal, Harrison stayed with his musician friend Gary Wright, who, Huntley suggests, [...] "play the diplomat" [...] by telling the press: [...] "He's writing lots of new things and he seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> good time...

500|$|After {{the release}} of Carey's single [...] "Obsessed", a song about an obsessed man who claims <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> {{relationship}} with her, suspicions were raised by many, including Eminem himself, that it was directed at Eminem, despite claims to the contrary by Cannon. As a response, Eminem released [...] "The Warning", in which he claims he still has proof of the couple. [...] Cannon responded to the song with his [...] "I'm a Slick Rick", and even challenged Eminem to a boxing match for charity which never took place. Though not released as a single {{or as part of}} an album, [...] "The Warning" [...] appeared on three Billboard charts.|$|E
500|$|Series lead Noah Wyle {{received}} several phone calls {{after the first}} season finale aired. The number one question was [...] "What the hell were you doing getting on that spaceship?"

Aubuchon added that Tom Mason's capture helped the writer's change the character slightly. He stated: [...] "Tom comes away from that experience feeling used and manipulated. It wasn't the experience [...] He {{thought he was going}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> nice conversation with an extraterrestrial being. It turned out to be worse than that.

Tom Breihan, a writer from Pitchfork Media, commented that in [...] "its brief onslaught of sneery fun, Vicki Leekx only occasionally reaches the dizzy pop heights of Arular and Kala. But it does give us an M.I.A. who, once again, seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> blast doing what she's doing. And it's great to learn this M.I.A. still exists".

500|$|Francis Bacon met George Dyer in a Soho pub. According to Bacon [...] "George {{was down}} {{the far end}} of the bar and he came over and said 'You all seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> good time, can I buy you a drink?'" [...] (Francis Bacon quoted in: Michael Peppiat, Francis Bacon: Anatomy of an Enigma, London 2008, p. 259). From that point on, Dyer became devoted to Bacon. He admired his intellect and power and was in awe of his self-confidence. He felt as if he had found a purpose, as the {{prominent}} artist's companion. Dyer was then about thirty years old and had grown up in the East End of London in a family steeped in crime. He had spent his life drifting between theft, juvenile detention center and jail. Typical of Bacon's taste in men, Dyer was fit, masculine, and not an intellectual.|$|E
500|$|The show {{received}} positive {{reviews and}} critical acclaim. David Segal from The Washington Post {{noted that the}} [...] "difference between this show and the last, the Drowned World Tour of 2001, was striking. That show seems standoffish compared with this one, in part because Madonna has finally worked through whatever issues prevented her from performing her earliest hits. [...] Madonna {{has created a new}} performance hybrid." [...] Segal's view was shared by Elizabeth Smith from The New York Times who also commented that [...] "Unlike 2001's Drowned World Tour, which was dark, often hostile, Re-Invention returns Madonna to the light. She looks as if she is having a good time." [...] Edna Gunderson of USA Today gave the concert four out of four stars and said [...] "Madonna seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> jolly good time. Whereas her last outing had technical strengths but lacked warmth, Reinvention finds Madonna reinvested emotionally. The show doesn't have the degree of flesh, carnal content or shock value that past outings delivered, but this time Madonna is opting for more heart than cleavage and more personality than profanity." [...] Joshua Klein from Chicago Tribune commented that Madonna's show displayed more spectacle than substance.|$|E

500|$|Nathin Rabin of The A.V. Club {{said the}} episode {{made him feel}} [...] "borderline euphoric", and said of it, [...] "With a light touch the show made an {{insightful}} point—that we need our dance-offs and workday discos and spontaneous expressions of delight." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN said the episode had [...] "an infectious sense of fun" [...] and {{felt as if the}} show producers [...] "just turned the camera on the cast's wrap party and let it roll a while". However, Fickett also said very little actually happened in the episode, which he said felt [...] "mostly like filler" [...] between the recently finished Michael Scott Paper Company arc and the following week's season finale, [...] "Company Picnic". New York magazine writer Will Leitch also said the episode felt lighter than recent episodes, but he said, [...] "that’s okay: They’ve earned a week off, and they sure seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> lot of fun." [...] He particularly praised the competition between Andy and Kelly, and Michael's dancing: [...] "There are few funnier dancers than Steve Carell, particularly Steve Carell amped on coffee." [...] Andy Shaw of TV Fodder said the episode allowed the entire cast to shine and included great chemistry between Phyllis Smith and Rainn Wilson. He also said he was glad to see Ellie Kemper get more screen time, [...] "and not just because she's Office eye candy. She adds some freshness to the cast, as she's the only person at Dunder Mifflin right now who doesn't really know anything about all the drama and backstory, so she just takes Michael and everyone else for face value." [...] Kelly West of Cinema Blend described [...] "Cafe Disco" [...] as [...] "one of the most random episodes of The Office." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1926 speakeasy {{that was}} [...] "as flat as stale beer" [...] for Burr [...] "had everything" [...] {{for at least}} one member of the cast. Hall remarked that the people on stage seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> {{wonderful}} time, while the audience couldn't understand why. In her book Lauren Bacall By Myself, Bacall confirmed the experience on stage. She wrote, [...] "The show was full of music, laughter, melodrama — the smoke of a speakeasy — The Yacht Club Boys singing songs on stage and moving through the audience — love—shooting. It had everything!" [...] Bacall remembered eagerly reading of the reviews. Even knowing the party would soon be over barely dimmed her joy in actually being a professional actress. Disappointment was part of the profession.|$|E
2500|$|At around 2:30p.m., Grant {{spoke with}} Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Wood, a classmate of his from West Point. [...] "General Sherman seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> hard time," [...] Grant observed. [...] "It {{seems as if}} {{we ought to go}} help him." [...] He decided to send Wood's and Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan's {{divisions}} against the Confederate rifle pits {{at the base of the}} ridge, hoping to concern Bragg and relieve the pressure on Sherman. Grant suggested his idea to Thomas, but personal relations between the two generals were chilly during the campaign and Thomas rebuffed Grant's ideahe had no intention of attacking until he was assured that Hooker was successfully attacking the enemy's flank. Meanwhile, IV Corps commander Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger was nearby, completely absorbed in the activities of a battery of artillery.|$|E

2500|$|Poirot {{is still}} in Switzerland after solving the third labour. Sightseeing, he takes a {{funicular}} to the mountain-top hotel of Rochers Neiges. On the way up, his ticket is checked by a conductor who passes him a hurriedly scribbled note that is apparently from Lementeuil, the Swiss Commissaire of Police. It tells Poirot {{that he has been}} recognised because of his moustaches and asks for his help. Marrascaud, a Parisian gangster, has fled from his homeland after the killing of Salley, a bookmaker, and is believed from information received <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> rendezvous with members of his gang at Rochers Neiges. Poirot considers the note; Marrascaud has been the prime suspect in many killings {{but this is the first}} time that his guilt is beyond doubt. Although he is annoyed that his holiday is being delayed, the phrase used by Lementeuil to describe Marrascaud – [...] "a wild boar" [...] – catches his interest. He sees in this the fourth of his self-imposed labours.|$|E
2500|$|The video {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, observing the chemistry between Spears and Azalea {{as well as}} praising Spears's dancing and noting a nod to her earlier music videos. Mike Wass for Idolator wrote, [...] "Yes, it lifts product placement to previously unimagined heights and I can’t see an Academy Award in either diva’s future — but it’s {{a hell of a}} lot of fun. And just kooky enough to become a cult classic like the movie it’s loosely based on". Josh Duboff from Vanity Fair described the video as [...] "entertaining and kind of weird. There’s a lot of big hair; Spears does some endearing waving (and generally seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> good time)". He concluded, [...] "Our favorite part is actually probably the tag at the end, where Spears and Azalea are just goofing around in the car; you can imagine Spears turning to Azalea afterwards and squealing, [...] "That was really cool, I had so much fun," [...] and meaning it". Kirthana Ramisetti for New York Daily News similarly noted, [...] "The two music stars seemed to have a lot of fun filming their video".|$|E
2500|$|Weill {{also contributed}} {{greatly to the}} Verfremdungseffekt by his music. Often the music would {{intentionally}} be unsuited for the onstage action, preventing the audience from getting carried away by the onstage emotion. For example, in act 2, scene 13, the hurricane has spared Mahagonny, and the people feel free to do whatever makes them happy. For Jacob Schmidt, this means eating a lot. He sings of how he has not had his fill yet with such lines as [...] "Not enough by half! / I may eat myself for supper." [...] And yet, the music betrays the seeming unbridled ecstasy of Jacob; he is singing to a discordant melody, and the accordion accompaniment sounds stark and rather macabre. The intention is that the audience realizes that all this is very wrong; Jacob claims <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> great time, but the music suggests all may not be well, thus the audience needs to pay attention {{and think about what}} is really going on. To further this point, Jacob then dies and the chorus sings of how happy he was while dragging out his corpse. This last twist of welcoming death is unexpected and contributes to the alienation.|$|E
