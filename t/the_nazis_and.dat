5|$|Although {{the films}} from 20th Century Fox had large budgets, high {{production}} values and {{were set in}} the Victorian era, Universal Studios updated the films to have Holmes fighting <b>the</b> <b>Nazis,</b> <b>and</b> produced them as B pictures with lower budgets. Both Rathbone and Bruce continued their roles when the series changed studios, as did Mary Gordon, who played the recurring character Mrs. Hudson.|$|E
5|$|By 1930, the {{violence}} between <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> <b>and</b> communists led to local SA troop leader Horst Wessel being shot by {{two members of}} the Communist Party of Germany. He later died in hospital. Exploiting Wessel's death, Goebbels turned him into a martyr for the Nazi movement. He officially declared Wessel's march Die Fahne hoch (Raise the flag), renamed as the Horst-Wessel-Lied, to be the NSDAP anthem.|$|E
5|$|In {{the postwar}} era, Poland, Spain, and Germany {{developed}} or re-established many well-respected Arabian stud farms. The studs of Poland in particular were decimated by both <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> <b>and</b> the Soviets, but {{were able to}} reclaim some of their breeding stock and became particularly world-renowned for their quality Arabian horses, tested rigorously by racing and other performance standards. During the 1950s, the Russians also obtained additional horses from Egypt to augment their breeding programs.|$|E

50|$|From 1939, {{having lost}} the war, {{many of the}} combatants of the party were {{executed}} or died in exile. Also, some militants in exile in France were captured by the French government, handed to <b>the</b> German <b>nazis</b> <b>and</b> deported to <b>the</b> extermination camps of Mauthausen and Gusen.

5|$|Nevertheless, {{underground}} {{organizations and}} individuals – {{in particular the}} Polish Underground State – saved much of Poland's most valuable cultural treasures, and worked to salvage as many cultural institutions and artifacts as possible. The Catholic Church and wealthy individuals contributed {{to the survival of}} some artists and their works. Despite severe retribution by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> <b>and</b> Soviets, Polish underground cultural activities, including publications, concerts, live theater, education, and academic research, continued throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|The former Belgian army fort at Breendonk, near Mechelen, was requisitioned by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> <b>and</b> {{used for}} detainment and {{interrogation}} of Jews, political prisoners and captured {{members of the}} resistance. Of the 3,500 people incarcerated in Breendonk between 1940 and 1944, 1,733 died. Around 300 {{people were killed in}} the camp itself, with at least 98 of them dying from deprivation or torture.|$|E
5|$|The synagogue {{was built}} in 1890. Its {{architecture}} {{is typical of the}} region, with a square shape and discreet neo-romanesque ornaments. Its cupola was destroyed in 1940 by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> <b>and</b> never rebuilt. The Jewish cemetery, located outside the old town, was opened in 1622. It has several 18th century gravestones showing a Christian artistic influence.|$|E
40|$|Henry V and Richard II {{made their}} {{first and only}} {{appearance}} on the Greek stage in the turbulent 1940 s. The first was performed in March 1941, just {{before the arrival of}} <b>the</b> German <b>nazis,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second in November 1947, a year after the problematic referendum {{on the future of the}} Greek monarchy and in the midst of the Greek civil war. The producer in both times was the state-funded National Theatre of Greece. The article argues that the national stage appropriated these plays in order to influence public sentiment about current historical events (World War II and restoration of monarchy), but it failed to make an impact in either case. The reasons for the failure are traced in the interrelationship of historical context, staging style, and audience needs...|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} 29, {{after several}} jobs in the Russian {{ceramics}} industry—inspecting factories in the Ukraine as well as designing for the Lomonosov and Dulevo factories—Zeisel was named {{artistic director of the}} Soviet china and glass industry. On May 26, 1936, while living in Moscow, Zeisel was arrested. She had been falsely accused of participating in an assassination plot against Joseph Stalin. She was held in prison for 16 months, 12 of which were spent in solitary confinement. In September 1937, Zeisel was expelled and deported to Vienna, Austria. Some of her prison experiences form the basis for Darkness at Noon, the well known anti-Stalinist novel written by a childhood friend, Arthur Koestler. It was while in Vienna that Zeisel re-established contact with her future husband Hans Zeisel, later a noted legal scholar, statistician, and professor at The University of Chicago. A few months after her arrival in Vienna <b>the</b> <b>nazis</b> invaded, <b>and</b> Eva took the last train out. She and Hans met up in England where they married and sailed for the U.S. with $67 between them.|$|R

5|$|Born in 1912, Potthast {{began as}} Himmler's {{secretary}} in 1936 and by 1938 {{she was his}} lover. She resigned from her duties in 1941, and subsequently had two children with Himmler, {{a boy and a}} girl. After the war, Potthast married and lived out {{the rest of her life}} outside the public eye. In post-war interviews, she refrained from answering questions about Himmler's involvement in war crimes committed by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> <b>and</b> her own knowledge of them. She died in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, while {{commanding}} Army Group Centre, {{he refused}} to dispatch troops {{to put down the}} Warsaw uprising (a task that ultimately was carried out by the SS), viewing it as a rear-area matter. He stated that the revolt arose from the mistreatment of the Polish population by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis,</b> <b>and</b> the army should {{have nothing to do with}} it. On the other hand, he showed no hesitation in clearing the Warsaw suburbs of Praga and Saska Kępa, through which vital supply lines ran.|$|E
5|$|Next came {{a career}} as chief purser on cargo and {{passenger}} ships travelling to South America, Europe, and Asia. In the 1930s, German and British passengers expressed fears about <b>the</b> <b>Nazis,</b> <b>and</b> military officers told him that Germany was equipping for war. Buckles witnessed antisemitism and its effects firsthand while ashore in Germany, and he warned acquaintances in Germany that their country would be brought down by Adolf Hitler, whom he encountered at a German hotel. Employed at sea during the Great Depression, he forwarded an $800 Army bonus to his father who was struggling as a farmer in the Oklahoma Dust Bowl (Buckles provided these details many decades later).|$|E

5|$|The {{idea of an}} Anschluss (union between Austria and Germany to form a Greater Germany), {{was one of the}} {{principle}} ideas of the Austrian branch of the National Socialist (Nazi) Party. Nazism can be seen as descended from the radical branches of the pan-Germanist movement. In 1933, <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> <b>and</b> the Greater German People's Party formed a joint working-group, and eventually merged. During the period while the Nazi Party and its symbols were banned in Austria, from 1933 to 1938, Austrian Nazis resumed the earlier pan-Germanist tradition of wearing a blue cornflower in their buttonhole.|$|E
5|$|While at American {{universities}} in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. He {{and his wife}} Elsa returned to Belgium by ship in March, and during the trip they learned that their cottage was raided by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> <b>and</b> his personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in Antwerp on 28 March, he immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship. The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a Hitler Youth camp.|$|E
5|$|As in World War I, Scapa Flow in Orkney {{served as}} an {{important}} Royal Navy base. Attacks on Scapa Flow and Rosyth gave RAF fighters their first successes downing bombers in the Firth of Forth and East Lothian. The shipyards and heavy engineering factories in Glasgow and Clydeside played a key part in the war effort, and suffered attacks from the Luftwaffe, enduring great destruction and loss of life. As transatlantic voyages involved negotiating north-west Britain, Scotland played a key part {{in the battle of}} the North Atlantic. Shetland's relative proximity to occupied Norway resulted in the Shetland Bus by which fishing boats helped Norwegians fled <b>the</b> <b>Nazis,</b> <b>and</b> expeditions across the North Sea to assist resistance. Perhaps Scotland's most unusual wartime episode occurred in 1941 when Rudolf Hess flew to Renfrewshire, possibly intending to broker a peace deal through the Duke of Hamilton.|$|E

Meanwhile, Marcus is captured in Hatay, while waiting with Sallah for the Joneses. The Joneses escape from Castle Brunwald. Henry tells Indy that to reach the Grail, one must face three booby traps and his diary contains the clues to guide them through the challenges safely. They recover the diary from Elsa at a book burning rally in Berlin. They then board a Zeppelin to leave Germany, but the Nazis soon discover the Joneses are aboard and they escape in a parasite biplane. They crash while engaging in a dogfight with Luftwaffe fighters.|$|E
5|$|In March 1933, the Enabling Act, an {{amendment}} to the Weimar Constitution, passed in the Reichstag by a vote of 444 to 94. This amendment allowed Hitler and his cabinet to pass laws—even laws that violated the constitution—without the consent of the president or the Reichstag. As the bill required a two-thirds majority to pass, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to keep several Social Democratic deputies from attending, as the Communists had already been banned. On 10 May, the government seized the assets of the Social Democrats and they were banned in June. The remaining political parties were dissolved and on 14 July 1933 Germany became a de facto one-party state when the founding of new parties was made illegal. Further elections in November 1933, 1936 and 1938 were entirely Nazi-controlled and saw only <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> <b>and</b> a small number of independents elected. The regional state parliaments and the Reichsrat (federal upper house) were abolished in January 1934.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{that they}} need one big show to raise the {{necessary}} money, the brothers persuade their old agent to book the Palace Hotel Ballroom, north of Chicago. They mount a loudspeaker atop the Bluesmobile and drive the Chicago area promoting the concert—and alerting the police, <b>the</b> <b>Nazis,</b> <b>and</b> the Good Ol' Boys of their whereabouts. The ballroom is packed with blues fans, police officers, and the Good Ol' Boys. Jake and Elwood perform two songs, then sneak offstage, as the tax deadline is rapidly approaching. A record company executive offers them a $10,000 cash advance on a recording contract—more than enough {{to pay off the}} orphanage's taxes and Ray's IOU—and then shows the brothers how to slip out of the building unnoticed. As they make their escape via a service tunnel, they are confronted by the mystery woman: Jake's vengeful ex-fiancée. After her volley of M16 rifle bullets leaves them miraculously unharmed, Jake offers a series of ridiculous excuses that she accepts, allowing the brothers to escape to the Bluesmobile.|$|E

5|$|SS-Untersturmführer (second lieutenant) Amon Göth {{arrives in}} Kraków to oversee {{construction}} of Płaszów concentration camp. When {{the camp is}} completed, he orders the ghetto liquidated. Many people are shot and killed {{in the process of}} emptying the ghetto. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a tiny girl in a red coat – one of the few splashes of color in the black-and-white film – as she hides from <b>the</b> <b>Nazis,</b> <b>and</b> later sees her body (identifiable by the red coat) among those on a wagon load of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and, through bribery and lavish gifts, continues to enjoy SS support. Göth brutally mistreats his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa, and the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth International was {{hit hard}} during World War II. Trotsky was assassinated, {{many of the}} FI's European {{affiliates}} were destroyed by <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> <b>and</b> several of its Asian affiliates were destroyed by the Empire of Japan. The survivors, in Europe, Asia and elsewhere, were largely cut off {{from each other and}} from the International Secretariat. The new secretary, Jean Van Heijenoort (also known as Gerland), was able to do little more than publish articles in the SWP's theoretical journal Fourth International. Despite this dislocation, the various groups sought to maintain links and some connections were kept up throughout {{the early part of the}} war by sailors enlisted in the U.S. Navy who had cause to visit Marseilles. Contact was steady, if irregular, between the SWP and the British Trotskyists, with the result that the Americans exerted what influence they had to encourage the Workers' International League into the International through a fusion with the Revolutionary Socialist League, a union that had been requested by the Emergency Conference.|$|E
5|$|The agents authorize Jones {{to recover}} the Ark to prevent the Nazis from obtaining it.

Jones visits Marion at her tavern, where she reveals her bitter feelings toward him from a previous romantic affair. She physically rebuffs his offer to buy the headpiece, and Jones leaves. Shortly after, a group of thugs arrive with their Nazi commander, Arnold Toht. Toht threatens Marion to get the headpiece, but when Jones returns to the bar to fight <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> <b>and</b> save Marion, her bar is accidentally set on fire; during the fight, the headpiece ends up in the fire and Toht severely burns his hand trying to take the hot headpiece, and flees the tavern screaming.
