5|$|Smith lost Morrell and <b>Trundle</b> on free transfers, and {{replaced}} them with Chris Armstrong and Chris Llewellyn. The club's financial problems meant that players went unpaid at the start of 2003–04, although they remained in the play-off places in December 2003. However, a hairline fracture to Shaun Pejic left Smith short of defenders and the promotion challenge ebbed away to a mid-table finish. Wrexham retained the FAW Premier Cup though with a 4–1 victory over Rhyl. However, Smith made himself unpopular with supporters after refusing to endorse their campaign to oust controversial chairman Alex Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|He signed wing-back Paul Edwards {{and held}} on to most of his key players for the 2002–03 season. Wrexham had a good start to the season and Smith won the Manager of the Month award for September 2002 after a {{sequence}} of four wins and two draws. A slump followed but Wrexham recovered from a poor October 2002 after coming from behind to beat Bournemouth on 9 November, as strikers Andy Morrell and Lee <b>Trundle</b> formed a good partnership, with Jones an impact substitute. Wrexham {{dropped out of the}} play-off places following a sequence of draws in March 2003, but new signing Scott Green scored both goals in a 2–0 win over Hartlepool United on 18 March, the first of a sequence of eight victories that took Wrexham into the third automatic promotion place with four matches to go. They held on to the position to secure promotion from the Third Division at the first attempt. Wrexham also beat Newport County 6–1 in the final of the FAW Premier Cup to secure an important £100,000 in prize money. Smith was named as the Manager of the Month for April and 2003, before winning the League Managers Association's Third Division Manager of the Season award.|$|E
25|$|After awakening, the two crews set {{right to}} work {{preparing}} for the mission's third EVA, which began at 18:01 UTC. The entire spacewalk was devoted to completing the cleaning, lubrication, removal and replacement of the <b>trundle</b> bearings assemblies in the starboard SARJ. The final <b>trundle</b> bearing assembly installation was deferred to the fourth EVA, but all other tasks scheduled were accomplished without any issues. Stefanyshyn-Piper's fifth EVA moved her to the twenty-fifth spot in cumulative EVA time with thirty three hours, forty two minutes.|$|E

25|$|STS-126 was {{scheduled}} to be a sixteen-day mission with four spacewalks, largely dedicated to servicing and repair of the Solar Alpha Rotary Joints (SARJ). An additional docked day was added to the flight plan to give the crew more time to complete their tasks. The starboard SARJ had shown anomalous behavior since August 2007, and its use has been minimized pending diagnosis and repair. Both the starboard and port SARJs were serviced. In addition to lubricating both bearings, the remaining 11 <b>trundle</b> bearings in the starboard SARJ were replaced. <b>Trundle</b> bearing assembly five was removed during an Expedition 16 EVA for further examination in December 2007.|$|E
25|$|By August 1965, RLAF {{sortie rate}} had {{drastically}} increased as attack aircraft inventory {{had built up}} to 24 T-28s, augmented by 3 RT-28s and several C-47s. The latter were used as improvised gunships/bombers, being armed with 0.50 caliber machine guns and equipped with a roller system to <b>trundle</b> 250 pound bombs out the cargo door during flight. This successful field expedient was eventually cancelled however, as it interfered with opium smuggling activities {{by some of the}} Royal Lao high command.|$|E
25|$|Blackpool {{finished}} the 2009–10 regular season in sixth place in The Championship, their highest {{finish in the}} Football League since 1970–71, and claimed {{a spot in the}} play-offs. On 2 May 2010, the 57th anniversary of Blackpool's FA Cup Final victory, Blackpool hosted Bristol City for the final League game of the season. They needed to match or better Swansea City's result in their match at home to Doncaster Rovers. Both matches ended in draws, with Swansea's Lee <b>Trundle</b> having a late goal disallowed for handball, which meant Blackpool secured the remaining play-off place.|$|E

25|$|The Hoop <b>Trundle</b> is {{performed}} {{to mark the}} re-founding of the school by King Henry VIII, in 1541. After he dissolved the monastery, he bestowed a royal charter on the new school and introduced the first scholars. The bowling of wooden hoops within the precincts of the cathedral, along with other games, {{was one of the}} privileges that they were afforded. Female competition was added when Queen Elizabeth II introduced Queen's scholars to the school, who have taken part since. There are both male and female heats leading to a final for which a separate tankard is awarded to both sexes. The course is a 75yard dash to a post and back along the east lawn of Ely Cathedral, all whilst beating the hoop with a wooden stick.|$|E
25|$|The {{final game}} of the regular season {{occurred}} on 5 May, with Blackpool's visiting Swansea City. Izzy Iriekpen put the Welsh club ahead on 14 minutes. The lead lasted only eleven minutes, however — Andy Morrell scoring the equaliser. Keigan Parker completed the turnaround just after the half-hour mark, and Blackpool led 2–1 at half-time. Two minutes into the second period, Lee <b>Trundle</b> put the Swans back on level terms. Iriekpen put the home side back in the lead on 55 minutes. Andy Morrell evened matters up again two minutes later, and then put Blackpool ahead on 61 minutes, completing his hat-trick in the process. He scored his fourth and Blackpool's fifth on 78 minutes, and Keigan Parker completed the rout with his second in the final minute. Blackpool won 6–3, and cemented their place in the play-offs with a third-placed finish in the table. The result also ended Swansea's play-off hopes and meant Blackpool finished as the division's top scorers.|$|E
25|$|In 1928 Clark {{began his}} studies in archaeology, {{which was then}} taught {{alongside}} physical anthropology and social anthropology within the university's anthropology department. The department was run by the Disney Professor Ellis Minns—whose ideas influenced Clark—while the archaeology curriculum was largely organised by Miles Burkitt, an unpaid lecturer of private means. Providing himself with a broad-based grounding in archaeology, Clark sat in on lectures given by archaeologists like Gertrude Caton Thompson, Dorothy Garrod, Leonard Woolley, and Childe. Although the Cambridge syllabus did not provide opportunities for excavation, Clark assisted the non-professional archaeologist Eliot Curwen during his excavations of the Whitehawk Neolithic causewayed camp near Brighton and then The <b>Trundle,</b> an Iron Age hillfort and Neolithic causewayed enclosure near Chichester. It was at the latter that he befriended two fellow excavators, Stuart Piggott and Charles Philips, who became lifelong friends. He also visited a number of Mortimer Wheeler's excavations, although never worked on them. Clark graduated in 1930 with a first-class honours degree.|$|E

25|$|Unexpected {{problems}} and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced {{abandonment of the}} station for safety reasons, had these problems not been resolved. During STS-120 in 2007, following the relocation of the P6 truss and solar arrays, it was noted during the redeployment of the array that it had become torn and was not deploying properly. An EVA {{was carried out by}} Scott Parazynski, assisted by Douglas Wheelock. The men took extra precautions {{to reduce the risk of}} electric shock, as the repairs were carried out with the solar array exposed to sunlight. The issues with the array were followed in the same year by problems with the starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ), which rotates the arrays on the starboard side of the station. Excessive vibration and high-current spikes in the array drive motor were noted, resulting in a decision to substantially curtail motion of the starboard SARJ until the cause was understood. Inspections during EVAs on STS-120 and STS-123 showed extensive contamination from metallic shavings and debris in the large drive gear and confirmed damage to the large metallic race ring at the heart of the joint, and so the joint was locked to prevent further damage. Repairs to the joint were carried out during STS-126 with lubrication of both joints and the replacement of 11 out of 12 <b>trundle</b> bearings on the joint.|$|E
500|$|In 1935, {{the head}} of the Metropolitan Police Special Branch told the Metropolitan Police Commissioner that Wallis was also having an affair with Guy Marcus <b>Trundle,</b> who was [...] "said to be {{employed}} by the Ford Motor Company".

500|$|Cardiff City's most {{significant}} rivalry is with nearby neighbours Swansea City, {{known as the}} South Wales derby, with the two sides having played each other over 100 times in all competitions. Swansea's first ever competitive fixture following their founding in 1912 was against Cardiff in the Southern Football League. In April 2006, relations between Cardiff City supporters and Swansea City supporters were aggravated after Swansea won the Football League Trophy final against Carlisle United at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. During their celebrations, Swansea players Lee <b>Trundle</b> and Alan Tate brandished a Welsh flag with an anti-Cardiff obscenity written on it in. As well as carrying the flag, <b>Trundle</b> was also seen wearing a T-shirt with {{an image of a}} Swansea City player urinating on a Cardiff City shirt. The Football Association of Wales (FAW) said the images paraded at the match, which took place at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on 2 April 2006, were [...] "of an extremely offensive and insulting nature and such behaviour is totally unacceptable". The two players in question were arrested by the Police on suspicion of section four public order offences, fined £2,000, and handed one-match suspensions.|$|E
500|$|The {{countryside}} {{around the}} village {{has been described}} as [...] "an area where the whole landscape is a piece of historya valley where time has stood still and the pattern of woods and fields is much as it was 500years ago". A designated ancient woodland lies to the north-west of the village. Predominantly centred on Barrows Wood but also including High Wood and <b>Trundle</b> Wood, this is likely a remnant of the woodland described by Hasted: [...] "...at the northern boundary of the parish there is a considerable quantity of wood, consisting mostly of hazel and oak, with numbers of trees of the latter, interspersed among them, which are but small, never here growing to any size." [...] An ancient track that passes through the remnants of this woodland has been damaged by the use of off-road vehicles leading to attempts by local landowners to block Drake Lane, a byway that runs through Drake Lane Wood in the south-west of the parish and which may have been used by recruits of Sir Francis Drake's navy. Deep water-logged ruts in the track have resulted in the partial resurfacing of the route.|$|E

2500|$|... ″The ancient chapel {{belonging}} {{to the town of}} Penzance may be seen in a fish cellar, near the key; it is small and as I remember had the image of the Virgin Mary in it.″ The chapel was built of greenstone and about 30ft in length and 15ft in breadth of which only a fragment remained in situ. In around 1800 the chapel was converted to a fish cellar. A carving in [...] "Ludgvan granite" [...] thought to be of St Anthony was removed in about 1830 and was used in the wall of a pig sty, which was further vandalised in 1850 when [...] "a stranger ... taking fancy to the stony countenance and rough hands, they were broken off and carried away as relics ...". The remains of the vandalised relic were taken to St Mary's Churchyard by a mason who told Mr Millett that he [...] "popped St Raffidy into a wheelbarrow and <b>trundle</b> him off to the chapel yard." [...] The carving remains in St Mary’s Churchyard and has been dated by Prof Charles Thomas as early 12th century. There are no early documents mentioning the dedication to St Anthony; this seems to depend entirely on tradition and may be groundless. A licence for Divine Service in the Chapel of St Gabriel and St Raphael was granted in 1429, but nothing more is known of this chapel except, possibly, for the mason who mentioned ″St Raffidy″ in 1850. Adjoining the chapel is St Anthony's Gardens, named in 1933 and containing an archway said to have been taken from the chapel site.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. <b>Trundle</b> {{had to be}} {{informed}} of all the mighty preparations that were making in London; and, being in a delicate state of health, was informed thereof through Mr. <b>Trundle,</b> lest the news should {{be too much for}} her; but it was not too much for her, inasmuch as she at once wrote off to Muggleton, to order a new cap and a black satin gown, and moreover avowed her determination of being present at the ceremony. Hereupon, Mr. <b>Trundle</b> called in the doctor, and the doctor said Mrs. <b>Trundle</b> ought to know best how she felt herself, to which Mrs. <b>Trundle</b> replied that she felt herself quite equal to it, and that she had made up her mind to go; upon which the doctor, who was a wise and discreet doctor, and knew what was good for himself, as well as for other people, said that perhaps if Mrs. <b>Trundle</b> stopped at home, she might hurt herself more by fretting, than by going, so perhaps she had better go. And she did go; the doctor with great attention sending in half a dozen of medicine, to be drunk upon the road.|$|E
