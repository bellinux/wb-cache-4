A number of small-arms men rushed aboard Chesapeake, led by Broke, including the purser, Mr G. Aldham, and the clerk, Mr John Dunn. Aldham and Dunn were killed as they crossed the gangway, {{but the rest of}} the party made it onto Chesapeake. Captain Broke, at the head of not more than twenty men, stepped from the rail of the waist-hammock netting onto <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> <b>of</b> the after-carronade of Chesapeake, and from there he jumped down to her quarterdeck. As the British boarded there were no American officers left on the quarterdeck to organise resistance.|$|E

25|$|The second patrol of U-156 {{was under}} the command of Werner Hartenstein. In {{coordination}} with the attack on Willemstad U-156 moved into Aruba's San Nicolaas harbor shortly after midnight on 16 February 1942 to torpedo three tankers. U-156 withdrew from the harbor as the damaged tankers spilled burning fuel, but returned that evening to shell the refinery. A nervous gunner failed to remove the tampion from <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> <b>of</b> the 10.5 cm SK C/32 naval gun, and the first shell detonated within the barrel. One gunner was killed, another seriously injured, and <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> <b>of</b> the gun barrel was splayed open. The injured crewman was put ashore in Martinique where he recovered after one leg was amputated. The crew used hacksaws to shorten the damaged gun barrel by 40 centimeters, and used the sawed-off gun to sink two ships encountered after all torpedoes had been expended sinking two other ships. U-156 started home on 28 February 1942.|$|E
25|$|Inside, Ruetten found Rasmussen dead on {{the living}} room floor, shot three times. There were signs of a struggle, such as a {{porcelain}} vase that had apparently been broken over Rasmussen's head prior to the shooting, a bloody handprint next to the burglar alarm's panic button, and a toppled credenza. It appeared that someone had bound her wrists, or tried to, at some point. She had defensive wounds and bore a bruise on her face that appeared to have been inflicted by <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> <b>of</b> a gun. The gun had been fired through a quilt, apparently to muffle the sound. The investigating criminalist also observed a bite mark on Rasmussen's arm, and took a swab from it.|$|E

The crew thinks it is a trap, but Kodai urges them to go ahead. He leads an attack party to the planet's surface against heavy Gamilas opposition. Much of the assault force is killed, and the remaining pilots stay behind to cover for Kodai, Sanada, Saito and Mori as they head for the coordinates.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Second World War, the British Army possessed two primary anti-tank weapons for its infantry: the Boys anti-tank rifle and the No. 68 AT Rifle Grenade. However, neither of these was particularly effective as an anti-tank weapon. The No. 68 anti-tank grenade was designed to be fired from a discharger fitted onto <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> <b>of</b> an infantryman's rifle, but this meant that the grenade was too light to deal significant damage, resulting in it rarely being used in action. The Boys was also inadequate in the anti-tank role. It was heavy, which meant that it was difficult for infantry to handle effectively, and was outdated; by 1940 it was effective only at short ranges, and then only against armoured cars and light tanks. [...] In November 1941 during Operation Crusader, part of the North African Campaign, staff officers of the British Eighth Army were unable to find even a single instance of the Boys knocking out a German tank.|$|E
500|$|The pre-war Australian Army uniform {{formed the}} basis of that worn by the AN and the AIF, which both adopted the broad-brimmed slouch hat and rising sun badge. Infantrymen used 1908-pattern webbing, while light {{horsemen}} used leather bandoliers and load carriage equipment. A large pack was issued as part of marching order. In 1915, infantrymen were issued with the SMLE and long sword bayonet, while periscope rifles were also used. From 1916 they also used manufactured hand grenades and rodded rifle grenades, both of which had been in short supply at Gallipoli (necessitating the use of improvised [...] "jam-tin" [...] grenades).

500|$|The {{weaponry}} {{and equipment}} of the Australian Army had mostly been standardised on that {{used by the}} British Army prior to the outbreak of World War I. During the war the equipment used changed as tactics evolved, and generally followed British developments. The standard issued rifle was the [...]303-inch Short Magazine Lee–Enfield Mark III (SMLE). Infantrymen used 1908-pattern webbing, while light horsemen used leather bandoliers and load carriage equipment. A large pack was issued as part of marching order.

500|$|On August 21, 2015, Stone and his {{childhood}} friends Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler, were traveling together during a sightseeing vacation in Europe when they boarded Thalys train 9364 from Amsterdam bound to Paris via Brussel. Stone was serving at the United States Air Force 65th Air Base Group. A 25-year-old Moroccan man, {{believed to be}} Ayoub El-Khazzani, was in train car No. 12, armed with an AKM assault rifle and equipped with 270 rounds of ammunition. Several people {{tried to stop the}} gunman, but failed to do so. Sadler reported that they heard a gunshot and breaking glass behind them, seeing an employee sprint down the aisle followed by a man with an automatic rifle. Stone woke up from the breaking glass, with Skarlatos telling Stone to [...] "go". Stone tackled the armed suspect, and was stabbed in the neck and eyebrow and almost lost his thumb. [...] Skarlatos took action and seized the assailant's rifle, beating him in the head with <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> <b>of</b> it until he was unconscious. Skarlatos stated that [...] "I was thinking about survival," [...] and [...] "t was to survive and for everybody else on the train to make it." [...] Stone was transferred to the central hospital in Lille, France and went under treatment in Germany, returning home September 3, 2015.|$|E
500|$|The Type 94 pistol is {{operated}} by a different mechanism than previous Japanese sidearms. Unlike previously designed Nambu pistols, the Type 94 operates with a concealed hammer and with a firing pin rather than a hammer. According to authors, Harry L. Derby and James [...] D. Brown, the firing pin is inherently weak and is prone to breakage because of a recess cut provided for the crossbolt and is prone to breaking at this point. The sturdier hammer firing mechanism was developed and included in the Type 94 to replace the poor striker on the Type 14 Nambu. The locking system is a rising-block type which floats independently between the lugs underneath the chamber end of the barrel. The single coil mainspring is positioned around the barrel instead of {{to the rear of}} the barrel as found on other Nambu pistols. [...] The grip is smaller than other Japanese pistols and is finished with smooth wood but according to author Jeff Kinard, are more comfortable for use by men with smaller hands. The magazine holds a maximum of six rounds because of the smaller grip and it is considered difficult to reload the weapon, with pressure from the bolt holding it inside the pistol. The magazine catch protrudes far enough to occasionally disengage when the [...] pistol is placed on its left side on a hard surface. The magazine could also disengage if squeezed into or jarred in a holster. The manual safety lever is located on the left rear of the frame and has the kanji for fire and safe stamped onto the frame. The front blade sight on <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> <b>of</b> the Type 94 pistol and the rear fixed V were occasionally inaccurately positioned making them useless when the weapon is being aimed. The rear sight was reduced from a U-shape to a simple notch in 1944 with the front blade being left unchanged but less attention to detail being applied as World War II progressed.|$|E

2500|$|The dog is a {{spring-loaded}} arm pivoted on {{the outside}} of the lock plate. A sparking material, usually a small piece of iron pyrite, is clamped and held by vice-like jaws at the swinging end of the arm. The dog has two possible positions to which it can be pivoted by hand: a [...] "safe" [...] position, in which the dog is pushed towards <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> <b>of</b> the firearm, and an [...] "operating" [...] position, where the dog is pulled towards the operator so that the pyrite in its jaws can engage either the top of the pan cover (see below), or (in the absence of the pan cover) the edge of a steel wheel bearing longitudinal grooves around its circumference. Flint is not suitable as a sparking material in the wheellock because it is too hard and would quickly wear away the wheel grooves.|$|E
2500|$|As soon as {{the wheel}} is {{released}} by the sear, the longer arm of the mainspring pulls the chain engaged in it. The {{other end of the}} chain being fixed to the cam on the wheel shaft, the latter rotates at high speed, whilst the rotating cam pushes forward the arm to which the pan cover is attached, thus causing the pan cover to slide forward towards <b>the</b> <b>muzzle</b> <b>of</b> the piece, and the pyrites to fall (under tension of the dog spring) on to the now rotating wheel. That is the second purpose of a sliding pan cover: were the pyrites to engage a stationary wheel, it would almost certainly jam the mechanism: but the built-in delay allows the pyrites to slip off the sliding pan-cover on to an already rotating wheel. A more modern development has been the use of a ball bearing between the wheel and the sear. [...] This design allows a smoother and lighter trigger pull, requiring less force to operate.|$|E
