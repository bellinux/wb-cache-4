5|$|There was no {{distinct}} {{break in}} the line of the royal family between the 17th and 18th dynasties. The historian Manetho, writing much later during the Ptolemaic dynasty, considered the final expulsion of the Hyksos after nearly a century and the restoration of native Egyptian rule over the whole country a significant enough event to warrant <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> dynasty.|$|E
5|$|In 1186, Philip Augustus {{demanded that}} he be given custody of Geoffrey's {{children}} and Brittany, and insisted that Henry order Richard to withdraw from Toulouse, {{where he had been}} sent with an army to apply new pressure on Philip's uncle, Raymond. Philip threatened to invade Normandy if this did not happen. He also reopened the question of the Vexin which had formed part of Margaret's dowry several years before; Henry still occupied the region and now Philip insisted that the King either complete the long agreed Richard-Alice marriage, or return Margaret's dowry. Philip invaded the Berry and Henry mobilised a large army which confronted the French at Châteauroux, before papal intervention brought a truce. During the negotiations, however, Philip suggested to Richard that he should ally with the French king against Henry, marking <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> strategy to divide the father and son.|$|E

5|$|In {{many ways}} Mycale {{represents}} <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{phase of the}} conflict, the Greek counterattack. After the victory at Mycale, the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont {{to break down the}} pontoon bridges, but found that this was already done. The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians remained to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians in the region, and their allies made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region, which the Athenians then laid siege to; after a protracted siege, it fell to the Athenians. Herodotus ended his Historia after the Siege of Sestos. Over the next 30 years, the Greeks, primarily the Athenian-dominated Delian League, would expel the Persians from Macedon, Thrace, the Aegean islands and Ionia. Peace with Persia came in 449 BC with the Peace of Callias, finally ending the half-century of warfare.|$|E
5|$|The rural Fasci in {{particular}} were a curious phenomenon: both ancient and modern. They combined millenarian aspirations with urban intellectual leadership often {{in contact with}} workers’ organizations and ideas in the more industrialized Northern Italy. According to the Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, the Fasci were millenarian insofar as the socialism preached by the movement was seen by the Sicilian peasantry as a new religion, the true religion of Christ – betrayed by the priests, {{who were on the}} side of the rich – that foretold the dawn of a new world, without poverty, hunger and cold, in accordance with God’s will. The Fasci, which included many women, were encouraged by the messianic belief that <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> reign of justice was looming and the movement spread like an epidemic.|$|E
5|$|Spanning World War II, when American comics {{provided}} {{cheap and}} disposable escapist entertainment {{that could be}} read and then discarded by the troops, the Golden Age of comic books covered the late 1930s to the late 1940s. A number of major superheroes were created during this period, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, and Captain America. In subsequent years comics were blamed for a rise in juvenile crime statistics, although this rise was shown to be {{in direct proportion to}} population growth. When juvenile offenders admitted to reading comics, it was seized on as a common denominator; one notable critic was Fredric Wertham, author of the book Seduction of the Innocent (1954), who attempted to shift the blame for juvenile delinquency from the parents of the children to the comic books they read. The result was a decline in the comics industry. To address public concerns, in 1954 the Comics Code Authority was created to regulate and curb violence in comics, marking <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> era.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} Law marked <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> chapter for Smuts. The {{preceding}} years at Stellenbosch had been ones of tremendous intellectual development. From the narrow {{focus of his}} upbringing, his outlook had now expanded, awakening within him a consciousness of the breadth of knowledge now open before him. Smuts, though remaining an adherent of the Church, and respectful of the Bible and its teachings, had developed a more questioning and critical outlook {{during the course of}} his studies. Whereas at the outset of his university career he was content to follow his parents' wishes and be ordained into the Church, as his time at Victoria College came to an end he found himself more and more unwilling to commit to this path. Though he had now as yet wholly rejected the idea of ordination, he wished for a period of more diversified study before making that decision. So it was that Smuts came to select Law, rather than Divinity or Philosophy - the logical choices for a future Minister of Religion.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} a new owner in Lerner and of manager Martin O'Neill marked <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> period of {{optimism}} at Villa Park and sweeping changes occurred throughout the club including a new badge, a new kit sponsor and team changes {{in the summer of}} 2007. The first Cup final of the Lerner era came in 2010 when Villa were beaten 2–1 in the League Cup Final. Villa made a second trip to Wembley in that season losing 3–0 to Chelsea in the FA Cup semifinal. Just five days before the opening day of the 2010–11 season, O'Neill resigned as manager, and after one year with Gérard Houllier in charge, Birmingham City manager Alex McLeish, despite numerous protests from fans against his appointment; {{this was the first time}} that a manager had moved directly between the two rivals. McLeish's contract was terminated at the end of the 2011–12 season after Villa finished in 16th place, and he was replaced by Paul Lambert. In February 2012, the club announced a financial loss of £53.9million, and Lerner put the club up for sale three months later, with an estimated value of £200 million. With Lerner still on board, in the 2014–15 season Aston Villa scored just 12 goals in 25 league games, the lowest in Premier League history, and Lambert was sacked in February 2015. Tim Sherwood succeeded him, and steered the club away from relegation while also leading them to the 2015 FA Cup Final, but he was sacked in the 2015–16 season, as was his successor Rémi Garde, in a campaign ended with Villa relegated for the first time since 1987.|$|E
