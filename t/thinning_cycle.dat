Carr) plantations on predominantly surface-water gley soils. Sites {{were selected to}} represent a typical Sitka spruce chronosequence following land use transition from grasslands dominated by surface-water gley soils. Based on inventory, eddy covariance, physiological and modelling assessments of net ecosystem productivity (NEP), we show that afforested stands are a C sink at 10 years, and possibly earlier, followed by an increase {{to a maximum of}} 9 t C ha− 1 year− 1 before the first <b>thinning</b> <b>cycle.</b> NEP subsequently declined from 9 t C ha− 1 year− 1, at closed canopy, to 2 t C ha− 1 year− 1 in older and thinned stands. Reductions in the C sequestration rate of older stands were coupled with a decrease in gross primary productivity, increases in maintenance/growth respiration and decomposition losses following harvest. We suggest that the high sequestration potential of these forests may be associated with the high net primary productivity of these plantations in Ireland, a high allocation of assimilates and litter into the belowground C pool and accumulation of C in mineral gley soils following afforestation...|$|E
40|$|Spectral {{analysis}} {{is a key}} tool for identifying periodic patterns in sedimentary sequences, including astronomically related orbital signals. While most spectral analysis methods require equally spaced samples, this condition is rarely achieved either in the field or when sampling sediment core. Here, we propose a method {{to assess the impact}} of the uncertainty or error made in the measurement of the sample stratigraphic position on the resulting power spectra. We apply a Monte Carlo procedure to randomise the sample steps of depth series using a gamma distribution. Such a distribution preserves the stratigraphic order of samples and allows controlling the average and the variance of the distribution of sample distances after randomisation. We apply the Monte Carlo procedure on two geological datasets and find that gamma distribution of sample distances completely smooths the spectrum at high frequencies and decreases the power and significance levels of the spectral peaks in an important proportion of the spectrum. At 5  % of stratigraphic uncertainty, a small portion of the spectrum is completely smoothed. Taking at least three samples per <b>thinnest</b> <b>cycle</b> of interest should allow this cycle to be still observed in the spectrum, while taking at least four samples per <b>thinnest</b> <b>cycle</b> of interest should allow its significance levels to be preserved in the spectrum. At 10 and 15  % uncertainty, these thresholds increase, and taking at least four samples per <b>thinnest</b> <b>cycle</b> of interest should allow the targeted cycles to be still observed in the spectrum. In addition, taking at least 10 samples per <b>thinnest</b> <b>cycle</b> of interest should allow their significance levels to be preserved. For robust applications of the power spectrum in further studies, we suggest providing a strong control of the measurement of the sample position. A density of 10 samples per putative precession cycle is a safe sampling density for preserving spectral power and significance level in the Milankovitch band. For lower sampling density, the use of gamma-law simulations should help in assessing the impact of stratigraphic uncertainty in the power spectrum in the Milankovitch band. Gamma-law simulations can also model the distortions of the Milankovitch record in sedimentary series due to variations in the sedimentation rate...|$|R

40|$|The {{succession}} of lithofacies {{of a part}} of the Barakar Formation of the Singrauli coalfield has been studied by statistical techniques. The lithologies have been grouped under five facies states viz. coarse-, medium-, and fine-grained sandstones, shale and coal for statistical analyses. Markov chain analysis indicates the arrangement of Barakar lithofacies in the form of fining-upward cycles. A complete cycle consists of conglomerate or coarse-grained sandstone at the base sequentially succeeded by medium- and fine-grained sandstones, shales and coal seam at the top. The entropy analysis puts the Barakar cycles in A- 4 type of cyclicity, which consists of different proportions of lower-, side- and upper-truncated cycles of lithologic states. Regression analysis indicates a sympathetic relationship between total thickness of strata (net subsidence) and number of coal cycles and an antipathic relationship between average thickness and number of coal cycles. The cyclic sedimentation of the Barakar Formation was controlled by autocyclic process, which occurred due to the lateral migration of streams triggered by intrabasinal differential subsidence. In many instances, the clastic sediments issued from the laterally migrating rivers interrupted the sedimentation resulting in <b>thinner</b> <b>cycles</b> in areas where the numbers of cycles are more. Principal component and multivariate regression analyses suggest that the net subsidence of the basin is mostly controlled by number and thickness of sandstone beds and coal seams...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 The growth {{potential}} of Douglas-fir, grand fir and western hemlock advance regeneration {{in the forest}} understory of Douglas-fir-dominated forests was investigated to detennine the feasibility of selection cutting systems in northwest Oregon. This study compared the growth of Douglas-fir, grand fir and western hemlock advance regeneration along a light gradient with hemispherical photography, modeled {{the relative importance of}} light, competition, subject tree and stand characteristics on growth and reported observations on the growth response of advance regeneration to stand manipulation. Western hemlock, grand fir and Douglas-fir advance regeneration was found at 5, 6, and 7 % of diffuse skylight in selection thinned stands respectively, indicating that all three species are capable of survival and growth in low light and, therefore, are suitable for uneven-aged management. Growth of advance regeneration in terms of height, diameter and volume followed the order: Western hemlock > Douglas-fir> grand fir, although there was seldom a significant difference between Douglas-fir and grand fir. Overtopping shrub vegetation significantly reduced growth and light availability in comparison to trees that were not overtopped. Height, radial and volume growth of all three species increased with increasing light. Regression analysis revealed that along the measured light gradient (6 44 % of diffuse skylight) i; growth of western hemlock was superior (different intercepts) to Douglas-fir at one interior Coast Range site but {{there was no significant difference}} in the relationship of growth to increased light levels (equal slopes) ii; Douglas-fir advance regeneration growth was superior (different intercepts) to grand fir at three sites but there was no significant difference in the relationship of growth to increased light levels (equal slopes). Growth modeling explained 36 to 67 % of the variation in Douglas-fir, western hemlock and grand fir advance regeneration growth and revealed that tree characteristics were better predictors of advance regeneration growth than environmental variables. Independent of species, live crown ratio was the most important variable explaining variation in absolute height growth. The best-growing trees were in general taller than competing shrub vegetation and characterized by higher live crown ratios. Western hemlock was particularly sensitive to shrub cover and grew best when shnib cover was low (< 35 %). Therefore, where possible, select future crop trees with a live crown ratio of at least 50 % for Douglas-fir and grand fir and 60 % for western hemlock and remove competing vegetation. Studying the release of midstory and understory trees at the four sites in northwestern Oregon after thinning revealed in general that Douglas-fir, grand fir and western hemlock grew better following release. However, the vigor of response differed for the three species and increased in the order of western hemlock, grand fir and Douglas-fir. Douglas-fir generally released more rapidly and more vigorously than grand fir, but also decreased more rapidly. To keep a significant proportion of the advance regeneration in a very vigorous state, <b>thinning</b> <b>cycles</b> of 6 to 10 years appear necessary.

40|$|From field {{observations}} and petrographic studies, a complex association of peritidal carbonate and siliciclastic facies {{have been recognized}} in the Villa Mónica Formation (Neoproterozoic), Sierra La Juanita, outcropping at the quarries of Estancia La Siempre Verde, Estancia La Placeres and Estancia Don Camilo, where carbonate facies have not been described 'in situ since their discovery in 1967. Three different detailed stratigraphic sections are fully described. On the one hand, calcareous facies (well-preserved head stromatolites) have developed in a shallow subtidal to lower intertidal environment. Laminated microbial mats, with millimetric to centimetric scale siliciclastic intercalations, were deposited in low-energy intertidal conditions. Shortlived continental input of quartzose clastic sediments did not obliterate the microbial colonies, which grow following a pattern of <b>thin</b> <b>cycles.</b> On the other hand, heterolithic facies, developed in high-energy intertidal conditions towards {{the top of the}} succession illustrate progressive change in the paleoenvironmental conditions which evolved from a shallow prograding carbonate platform, with periodical sea level oscillations, to siliciclastic tidal influenced littoral conditions with minor development of microbial mat deposits. The recognition of MISS'(microbiall) < induced sedimentary structures) represented by microbial mats developed in siliciclastic facies was decisive for the evaluation of paleoenvironmental conditions and for the decision to assign heterolithic lithofacies described in this paper to the Villa Mónica Formation.

40|$|On the {{continental}} rise {{west of the}} Antarctic Peninsula there are nine large mounds interpreted as sediment drifts, separated by turbidity current channels. Drift 7 is 150 km long, 70 km wide and up to 700 m high and is asymmetric, with steep sides on the south-east (towards the continent) and south-west, and gentle slopes to north-west and north-east. Cores on the gentle sides of the drift show a cyclicity between brown, bioturbated, diatom-bearing mud with foraminifera and radiolarians, and grey, laminated, barren mud. Biostratigraphic evidence {{is consistent with a}} Late Quatermary age. Detailed lithostratigraphy and magnetic susceptibility data allow precise correlation over distances of tens of kilometres. On the basis of chemostratigraphy, the brown sediment is interpreted as interglacial (isotope stages 1 and 5) and the grey as glacial (stages 2 – 4 and 6). Sedimentation rates are 3. 0 – 5. 5 cm ka- 1. Cores on the steep sides of the drift recovered a condensed section with <b>thinner</b> <b>cycles</b> and hiatuses. Fine grain size, very poor sorting and the absence of a mode in the silt size range indicate deposition from suspension with only weak current activity. There is little evidence for cyclic changes in bottom current strength. Supply of sediment to the benthic nepheloid layer was by entrainment of mud from turbidity currents, and by setting of pelagic material (biogenic grains, IRD, sediment suspended in meltwater plumes). Cyclic changes in sediment supply include more biogenic supply in interglacials with less sea ice cover, more terrigenous supply from turbidites in glacials with ice sheets grounded to the shelf edge, and changes in IRD conten...|$|R
40|$|Spectral {{analysis}} {{has become a}} key tool for identifying the imprint of astronomical forcing on sedimentary records. In a next step, the identified cycles often contribute {{to the construction of}} a precise Geological Time Scale and to an in-depth understanding of past climate changes. Most of spectral analyses (Fast Fourier Transforms, the Multi-Taper Method...) require a constant sample step. Unfortunately, an equally spaced geological data series is, in practice, nearly impossible to obtain from field sedimentary series. Usually, there is a 10 % uncertainty on the field measurements of the stratigraphic thickness within sedimentary series. Hence, important uncertainties exist on the actual position of each sample. Another source of uncertainty are errors in a time-space model. In this study, we explore the impact that the stratigraphic uncertainty on the sample position has on the result of spectral analyses. To simulate this uncertainty, we developed a model based on the Monte Carlo randomisation of the distance between each successive point. In this way, the stratigraphic order of the data points is not affected after imp lementating this model. The application of this model to a theoretical sinusoid series and to several real sedimentary series shows that uncertainties in the actual position of samples can highly reduce the spectral powers of the frequencies ranging from the Nyquist Frequency up to 1 / 10 of the Nyquist Frequency. We the demonstrate that the precise reconstruction of the Milankovitch cycles in the sedimentary record requires a higher sampling density than previously suggested with, at least, 10 samples per <b>thinnest</b> <b>cycle</b> to be detected, i. e. 10 samples per precession cyclePeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a stochastic forest growth {{model in}} which the manager is able to first thin the forest to promote better growth before harvesting. Both Wicksell single <b>thinning</b> and harvesting <b>cycle</b> and Faustmann on-going rotation problems are considered. The Wicksell problem is analyzed by first restricting the class of decision times to (thinning, harvesting) pairs that bound the growth away from infinity and imbedding the problem in an infinite-dimensional linear program on a space of triplets of measures. These measures capture the thinning and harvesting decisions along with {{the behavior of the}} growth process prior to harvest. An auxiliary linear program then leads to a nonlinear optimization problem for which an optimal value and solution are determined. The values of all the problems are be related through a set of inequalities. The solution of the nonlinear problem determines (random) thinning and harvesting times for the single <b>thinning</b> and harvesting <b>cycle</b> which demonstrate the equality of the values of these various problems. Finally for the Wicksell problem, the unrestricted class of thinning and harvest times is shown to give the same value as the restricted class. The Faustmann on-going thinning and harvesting rotation problem is reduced to a Wicksell problem which then allows for the characterization of the value as the solution to a different nonlinear optimization problem. The effects of the opportunity to thin the forest are illustrated on a mean-reverting stochastic model.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Anhydrite cement causes {{significant}} heterogeneity {{within the}} San Andres reservoir of the Vacuum Field {{where it is}} associated with faults, fractures, karst zones and highly cemented dolomite intervals. The primary reservoir rocks within the Central Vacuum Unit of the Vacuum Field are dolomitized peloidal packstones, skeletal and ooid grainstones and fusulinid packstones. These rocks alternate with lower reservoir-quality dolomite intervals with variable amounts of anhydrite cement. Nodular and pore-filling fabric-selective anhydrite cements are common within the reservoir interval. Cross-plots of apparent matrix grain-density versus apparent matrix volumetric cross-section (maa–Umaa cross-plots), combined with Vp/Vs seismic attributes and core data, {{provide insight into the}} vertical and lateral distribution of anhydrite within the San Andres reservoir. Anhydrite is generally concentrated in <b>thin</b> depositional <b>cycles</b> or intervals that are separated by relatively anhydrite-free cycles that exhibit relatively higher porosity and permeability.

The major part is represented by high forest often issued from the conversion of coppice woods, which in the past was the silvicultural system most widely applied mainly to provide fire wood. The social changes occurred {{in the second half}} of the last century –fire wood market crisis and the increasing importance of environmental issues- enhanced the conversion into high forest of large areas previously managed as coppice by means of different silvicultural treatments and practices. Nevertheless, the environmental benefits of this choice were not adequately investigated. Results of annual measurements (1992 - 2009) made in a beech coppice stand aged 65 are here reported. The study area is located on the Alpe di Catenaia, a pre-Apennine outcrop close to Arezzo (Central Italy). Variables strictly related to stand productivity and dynamics such as annual litter and seed production, leaf area index (LAI) and transmittance (PAR) were measured in the research area of Buca Zamponi to estimate the effects of two theses, natural evolution (TEST) and conversion into high forest (DIR). Three thinnings were undertaken in the latter thesis in 1972, 1987 and 2002. Additional theses of natural evolution (CONTR) and advance seed cutting (TS) were added in 2002 in a nearby study area (Eremo della Casella). Results showed the high productivity of coppice stands, under conversion to high forest, with mean values of annual total litter, leaf litter and leaf area index of 5 Mg ha- 1, 3 Mg ha- 1 and 6 m 2 m- 2, respectively.

For the first time, the film capacities have been corrected for the oxygen evolution side reaction, and the data used as input into the point defect-containing structural model to track the changes that occur during short-term cycling. Variations in capacity and mass during formation and charge/discharge cycling are related to changes in the point defect parameters, thus providing a structural origin for the unique experimental variations observed here and often reported in the literature, but previously unexplained. Proton-, potassium-, and water-content vary in the active material during charge/discharge cycling. The observed capacity loss, or ''capacity fade'', is explained by incomplete incorporation of potassium ions in (or near) the nickel vacancy during charge, as additional protons are then allowed to occupy the vacant lattice site. The increase in water content during reduction parallels the expansion of the electrode that is well known during cycling.

The deltaic sedimentary rocks vary markedly along strike and record deposition in four different deltaic sUbenvironments, namely: (A) "Normal" central delta lobe areas characterized by distal mouth bar sandstone-shale rhythmites gradationally overlain by proximal distributary mouth bar sandstones.

The stratigraphic analysis was based on three different stages, the 1 D, 2 D and 3 D analysis; these ones were adapted to the sequence stratigraphy concepts {{in order to create}} a chronostratigraphic framework for the study area within the basin. The database used in the present study contains field and well information, wells that belong to Santana Project, carried out by the Ministério de Minas e Energia- DNPM- CPRM from 1977 to 1978. The analysis 1 D, which was done separately for each well and outcrop allowed the recognition of 13 sedimentary facies, mainly divided based on predominant litologies and sedimentary structures. Such facies are lithologically represented by pebble, sandstones, claystones, margas and evaporates; these facies are associated in order to characterize different depositional systems, that integrate from the continental environment (fluvial system and lacustre), paralic system (delta system and lagunar) to the marine environment (shelfenvironment). The first one, the fluvial system was divided into two subtypes: meandering fluvial system, characterized by fill channel and floodplain deposits; the facies of this system are associated vertically according to the textural <b>thinning</b> upward <b>cycles</b> (dirting-up trend pattern in well logs). Lacustrine environment is mainly related with the lithotypes of the Crato Formation, it shows a good distribution within the basin, been composed by green claystone deposits and calcareous laminated. Deltaic System represented by prodelta and delta front deposits which coarsening upward tendency. Lagunar system is characterised by the presence of anhydrite and gypsum deposits besides the black claystone deposits with vegetal fragments which do not contain a fauna typically marine. The marine platform system is composed by successions of black and gray claystone with fossiliferous fauna of Dinoflagellates (Spiniferites Mantell, Subtilisphaera Jain e Subtilisphaera Millipied genre) typical of this kind of depositional system. The sedimentary facies described are vertically arranged in cycles with progradational patterns which form textural coersening upward cycles and retrogradational, represented by textural <b>thinning</b> dowward <b>cycles.</b> Based in these cycles, in their stack pattern and the vertical change between these patterns, the systems tracks and the depositional sequences were recognized. The Low System Track (LST) and High System Track (HST) are composed by cycles with progradational stack pattern, whereas the Trangessive System Track (TST) is composed by retrogradational stack pattern cycles. The 2 D stratigraphic analysis was done through the carrying out of two stratigraphic sections. For the selection of the datum the deepest maximum flooding surface was chosen, inside the Sequence 1, the execution of these sections allowed to understand the behaviour of six depositional systems along the study area, which were interpreted as cycles of second order or supercycles (cycles between 3 and 10 Ma), according to the Vail, et al (1977) classification. The Sequence 1, the oldest of the six identified is composed by the low, transgressive and high systems tracks. The first two system tracks are formed exclusively by fluvial deposits of the Rio da Batateira Formation whereas the third one includes deltaic and lacustrine deposits of the Crato Formation. The sequences 2 and 3 are formed by the transgressive systems tracks (lake spreading phase) and the highstand system track (lake backward phase). The TST of these sequences are formed by lacustrine deposits whereas HST contains deltaic deposits, indicating high rates of sedimentary supply at the time of it s deposition. The sequence 4 is composed by LST, TST and HST, The TST 4 shows a significant fall of the lake base level, this track was developed in conditions of low relation between the creation rate of space of accommodation and the sedimentary influx. The TST 4 marks the third phase of expansion of the lacustrine system in the section after the basin´s rift, the lacustrine system established in the previous track starts a backward phase in conditions that the sedimentary supply rate exceeds the creation rate of space accommodation. The sequence 5 was developed in two different phases, the first one is related with the latest expansion stage of the lake, (TST 5), the basal track of this sequence. In this phase the base level of the lake rose considerably. The second phase (related to the TST 5) indicates the end of the lacustrine domain in the Araripe Basin and the change to lagunar system ant tidal flat, with great portions in the supratidal. These systems were formed by restricted lagoons, with shallow level of water and with intermittent connections with the sea. This, was the phase when the Araripe Basin recorded the most several arid conditions of the whole interval studied, Aptian Albian, conditions that allow the formation of evaporitic deposits. The sequence 6 began its deposition after a significant fall of the sea (LST 6). The sequence 6 is without any doubtlessly, the sequence that has deposits that prove the effective entrance of the sea into the Araripe Basin. The TST 6, end of this sequence, represents the moment which the sea reaches its maximum level during the Aptian Albian time. The stratigraphic analysis of the Aptian Albian interval made possible the understanding that the main control in the development of the depositional sequences recognized in the Araripe Basin were the variations of the local base level, which are controlled itself by the climate changesO presente trabalho tem como objetivo principal realizar uma análise estratigráfica detalhada do intervalo Aptiano ao Albiano na parte leste da Bacia do Araripe, NE do Brasil, o qual corresponde, litoestratigraficamente, às formações Rio da Batateira, Crato, Ipubí e Romualdo. A análise estratigráfica envolveu três etapas distintas, a análise 1 D, 2 D e 3 D, nas quais foram adaptados os conceitos da estratigrafia de seqüências visando elaborar um arcabouço de caráter cronoestratigráfico para a porção estudada da bacia. Tal estudo contou com uma base de dados integrada por informação de campo e de poços pertencentes ao projeto Santana, realizado pelo Ministério de Minas e Energia- DNPM- CPRM nos anos de 1977 e 1978. A análise 1 D, por meio da análise individual de cada afloramento e poço, permitiu o reconhecimento de 13 fácies sedimentares, individualizadas com base principalmente nas litologias predominantes e nas estruturas sedimentares. Tais fácies são representadas litologicamente por conglomerados, arenitos, pelitos, calcários, margas e evaporitos. As mesmas se associam de forma a caracterizar diferentes sistemas deposicionais, que integram desde o ambiente continental (sistemas fluvial e lacustre), ambiente parálico (sistemas deltaico e lagunar) até o ambiente marinho (sistema plataformal). O primeiro deles, o sistema fluvial, foi dividido em dois sub-tipos: o sistema fluvial meandrante, caracterizado por depósitos de preenchimento de canal e depósitos de planície de inundação, e o sistema fluvial entrelaçado formado principalmente por depósitos de preenchimento de canal; as fácies deste sistema se associam verticalmente segundo ciclos de afinamento textural para o topo (padrão em sino nos perfis geofísicos). O sistema lacustre, relacionado principalmente aos litótipos da Formação Crato, apresenta uma boa distribuição na bacia, sendo composto por depósitos de pelitos verdes e calcários laminados. O sistema deltaico, representado por depósitos de prodelta e de frente deltaica, os quais se dispõem verticalmente em ciclos com granocrescência para o topo (padrão em sino invertido nos perfis geofísicos). O sistema lagunar caracteriza-se pela presença de depósitos de anidrita e gipsita, além dos depósitos de pelitos negros com restos vegetais, os quais não contêm uma fauna tipicamente marinha. O sistema de plataforma marinha é composto por sucessões de pelitos pretos e cinza com faunas fossiliferas de Dinoflagelados (gêneros Spiniferites Mantell, Subtilisphaera Jain e Subtilisphaera Millipied), típicas de este tipo de sistema deposicional. As fácies sedimentares descritas se arranjam verticalmente de forma a compor ciclos com padrões de empilhamento progradacional, os quais formam ciclos com engrossamento textural para o topo, e retrogradacional, representados por ciclos com afinamento textural para o topo. Com base nestes ciclos, em seus padrões de empilhamento e na mudança verticais entre estes padrões, foram reconhecidos os tratos de sistemas e as seqüências deposicionais. Os tratos de sistemas de Nível Baixo e o de Nível Alto são compostos por ciclos com padrão de empilhamento progradacional; o Trato de Sistemas Transgressivo, por sua vez, é formado por ciclos com padrão de empilhamento retrogradacional. A análise estratigráfica 2 D foi elaborada por meio da realização de duas seções estratigráficas. Para a escolha do datum foi privilegiada a superfície de máxima inundação mais basal, interna à Seqüência 1. A elaboração destas seções possibilitou compreender o comportamento de seis seqüências deposicionais ao longo da área de estudo, as quais foram interpretadas como ciclos de segunda ordem ou superciclos (ciclos com durações entre 3 e 10 Ma), segundo a classificação de Vail, et al (1977). A Seqüência 1, mais antiga das seis seqüências identificadas, é composta pelos tratos de sistemas de Nível Baixo, Transgressivo e de Nível Alto. Os dois primeiros tratos são formados exclusivamente pelos depósitos fluviais da Formação Rio da Batateira, ao passo que o terceiro inclui depósitos deltaicos e lacustres da Formação Crato. As seqüências 2 e 3 são formadas pelos tratos de sistemas Transgressivo (TST; fase de expansão do lago) e de Nível Alto (TSNA; fase retração do lago). Os TST s destas seqüências são formados por depósitos lacustres, ao passo que os TSNA s contêm depósitos deltaicos, indicando assim condições de alta taxa de suprimento sedimentar na época da deposição deste. A seqüência 4 é formada pelos tratos de sistemas de Nível Baixo (TSNA), Transgressivo e de Nível Alto. O TSNB registra uma queda importante do nível base do lago; este trato se desenvolveu em condições de baixa razão entre a taxa de criação de espaço de acomodação e a taxa de influxo sedimentar. O TST marca a terceira fase de expansão do sistema lacustre na seção pós rifte da bacia; o sistema lacustre implantado no trato anterior inicia uma fase de retração em condições em que a taxa de aporte sedimentar passa a suplantar a de criação de espaço de acomodação. A seqüência 5 desenvolveu-se em duas fases distintas. A primeira relaciona-se com a última etapa de expansão do lago, (TST), trato basal desta seqüência. Nesta fase, o nível base do lago subiu consideravelmente. A segunda fase, relacionada ao TSNA), indica o final do domínio lacustre na Bacia do Araripe e a mudança para sistemas lagunares e de planície de maré, com grande desenvolvimento das porções de supramaré. Estes sistemas eram formados por lagunas restritas, com lâmina de água rasa, e com conexão intermitente com o mar. Esta foi a fase em que a Bacia do Araripe registrou as mais severas condições de aridez de todo intervalo estudado, Aptiano ao Albiano, condições estas que propiciaram a formação de depósitos evaporíticos. A seqüência 6 iniciou sua deposição após uma queda significativa do incipiente mar (TSNB). Esta seqüência é, indubitavelmente, a que contém os depósitos que comprovam a efetiva entrada do mar na Bacia do Araripe. O TST, trato final desta seqüência, representa o momento em que o nível do mar atingiu o seu máximo durante todo o intervalo Aptiano ao Albiano. A análise estratigráfica do intervalo Aptiano ao Albiano permitiu compreender que o controle principal no desenvolvimento das seqüências deposicionais reconhecidas na Bacia do Araripe foram às variações do nível de base local, as quais são controladas, por sua vez, pelas mudanças climática...|$|R
40|$|Dengue is an {{emerging}} disease mainly spread throughout tropical and subtropical {{regions of the}} world. An estimate of three hundred and eighty million infections occurs annually [2]. Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted to humans primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito and causes a variety of clinical illnesses classified as dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Secondary infection and viral strain are associated with DHF/DSS. ^ Like many RNA viruses, DENV exhibits substantial genetic diversity. Such genetic subtlety may have significant implications {{for the emergence of}} new genotype(s) and lead to viruses with altered antigenicity and pathogenesis, ultimately influencing disease transmission patterns. This thesis aims to study the genetic variation of the nonstructural proteins within DENV- 2 strains from different genotypes and their influence in RNA replication and infectivity. The protein sequences of highly pathogenic (DHF) versus less pathogenic (DF) patient isolated strains from diverse geographical locations were compared. Single amino acid substitutions of conserved surface exposed residues in the NS 3 and NS 5 proteins from within strains derived from DHF patients were identified and targeted for mutagenesis using DENV- 2 16681 as the parental virus. Rescued viruses displayed varied phenotypes and were characterized by RNA synthesis and infectivity. Substitutions in NS 3 protein I 160 T, S 171 N and K 213 N had no effect on RNA synthesis or infectivity. Substitution T 399 A affected RNA synthesis by 3 logs and produced second site reversions responsible for the wild-type growth kinetics. ^ Substitution of residue I 135 T, E 558 K and N 730 S in the NS 5 protein had a 1 log reduction in RNA synthesis whereas I 135 V, V 723 N and K 800 T produced a 3 log reduction. Furthermore, amino acid substitution Q 819 L in the NS 5 protein showed 1 log reduction in RNA synthesis when compared to the wild type, however it completely prevented the production of plaques. Localization of NS 5 protein to the nucleus was not affected in the NS 5 substitutions. The Q 819 L substitution is defective in its ability to lyse and spread in BHK cells (i. e CPE) by fifty percent. Q 819 L amino acid substitution produced 2 to 2. 5 logs less numbers of RNA molecules when compared to the wild type, suggesting that there is a defect in the number of RNA containing particles. Single particle tracking experiments showed that wild type as well as Q 819 L virus particles were able to enter BHK and C 636 cells and fuse with cellular membranes, suggesting that the defect might be in another step of the virus life <b>cycle.</b> <b>Thin</b> sections on DENV particles showed that the Q 819 L mutant produced wild type particles (50 nm in diameter) as well as particles of approximately 30 - 35 nm in diameter, which were localized in the cytoplasm as well as within cellular compartments, suggesting that a subset of particles produced by the mutant are non-infectious subviral particles, in part explaining the lack of plaque production by plaque assay. Thin section together with qRT-PCR studies lead to the suggestion that Q 819 L is involved in the assembly process by reducing the number of release virus particles (mature and/or immature) and by increasing the number of subviral particles produced by this mutant. Coupling between genome replication and virus assembly has been reported before in YFV and KUNV NS 3 and NS 2 A proteins. This study is the first to report the role of DENV- 2 NS 5 in virus assembly. Due to the role of NS 5 in replication, as well as virus assembly and production as suggested here, NS 5 is a good target for antiviral development. ...|$|R
40|$|The Codó Formation is an {{important}} geological unit in Brazil, representing the only record of Neoaptian rocks exposed along the Brazilian equatorial margin. This unit consists of bituminous black shales, limestones and evaporites, which are particularly well represented {{in the south and}} east margins of the São Luís-Grajaú Basin, around the towns of Codó and Grajaú, State of Maranhão. These areas were investigated in order to: 1. improve the depositional system, discussing the hypothesis that the Codó Formation was produced in a lacustrine setting; and 2. reconstruct the paleohydrological conditions with basis on the integration of facies, stratigraphy, petrography and isotope (C, O,Sr and S) data. Hence, the field data presented herein confirmed a lacustrine system for the Codó area, where prevailed stable, well-stratified, saline lakes characterized by periods of closure, anoxia and salt precipitation in the central saline lakes. On the other hand, ephemeral conditions with development of a sabkha/saline pan complex prevailed in the Grajaú area, where salts precipitated mostly in the marginal portions of the system (i. e., marginal saline pans and mudflats). Studies focusing facies and stratigraphy also revealed that in both areas the Codó Formation is arranged into several shallowing-upward cycles formed by progradation of marginal into central lake deposits. Three types of cycles were distinguished, referred to here as lower, intermediate and higher rank cycles. The lower rank cycles correspond to millimetric interbeddings of: a) bituminous black shale and evaporite; b) bituminous black shale and calcimudstone; c) bituminous black shale and peloidal wackestone-packstone; d) grey/green shale and calcimudstone; e) grey/green shale and peloidal wackestone-packstone; f) grey/green shale and ostracodal wackestone/grainstone; h) ostracodal wackestone/grainstone and/or calcimudstone with cryptomicrobial mats and ooidal/pisoidal packstone. These are attributed to seasonal deposition with basis on their regular nature forming very <b>thin</b> <b>cycles</b> resembling varves. The intermediate rank cycles average 1. 7 m thick and are formed by complete and incomplete cycles. Complete cycles show an upward transition from central to intermediate and then marginal facies associations, and include two types: C 1 cycles with central lake deposits consisting of evaporites and black shales; and C 2 cycles with central lake deposits formed by gray/green shale. Incomplete cycles are those formed by successions lacking {{at least one of the}} facies associations, consisting of either central and intermediate lake deposits (cycles I 1) or intermediate and marginal lake deposits (cycles I 2). The higher rank cycles average 5. 2 m thick and consist of four depositional units, which display shallowing-upward successions formed by both complete and incomplete, intermediate rank cycles that vary their distribution upward in the section, and are bounded by sharp surfaces. Unit 1, the lowermost one, averages 2. 7 m in thickness, being entirely composed by <b>thin</b> I 1 <b>cycles.</b> Unit 2 averages 5. 2 m thick, and displays all of the aforementioned intermediate cycles, especially complete ones. Unit 3, averaging 2. 6 m thick, consists of 80 % of cycles I 2. Finally, unit 4, which averages 2. 2 m in thickness, displays only incomplete cycles, though its uppermost part was not preserved due to erosion during the development of the Aptian sequence boundary. The detailed sedimentological characterization and the stratal stacking patterns of the intermediate and higher rank cycles support a genesis linked to syn-sedimentary tectonic activity, particularly suggested by high facies variability, limited lateral extension, as well as frequent and random thickness changes of the intermediate-rank cycles. Additionally, the matching between the four higher rank cycles with four stratigraphic zones having different styles of soft-sediment deformation structures previously described in the literature as resulting from seismic activities, is a further argument to corroborate this interpretation. Therefore, the several episodes of lake shallowing recorded in the intermediate and higher rank cycles of the Codó Formation are attributed to fluctuations in the lake water level, triggered by seismic pulses alternating with sediment deposition. The petrographic analysis of the evaporites from the Codó Formation allowed to better defining both the lake-sabkha-saline pan depositional system and the post-depostional histories. Seven evaporite morphologies were recognized: 1. chevron (selenite) gypsum; 2. nodular/lensoidal gypsum/anhydrite; 3. acicular gypsum; 4. mosaic gypsum; 5. brecciated gypsum/gypsarenite; 6. pseudo-nodular anhydrite/gypsum; and 7. rosettes of gypsum. Despite of this large variety of evaporite phases, the chevron gypsum, the nodular/lensoidal gypsum/anhydrite and the brecciated gypsum/gypsarenite record the preservation of primary features. The association of these morphologies with deposits displaying cyclic horizontal bedding, attributed to lake level fluctuations eventually culminated with subaerial exposure, reinforces this interpretation. Even acicular gypsum and mosaic gypsum, which replaced the chevron and brecciated gypsum/gypsarenite, respectively, formed under the influence of the depositional surface. Burial phases of gypsum are only recorded in the pseudo-nodular anhydrite/gypsum, attributed to salt mobilization induced by halokinesis. In addition, rosettes of gypsum, which crosscut the other evaporite morphologies, diagenetic in origin, have probably formed as the latest evaporite phase of the study area, under the influence groundwater and/or surface weathering. In the present research, isotope studies aiming paleoenvironmental purposes were motivated by both confirmation of strong depositional influence for at least great part of the evaporites from the Codó Formation (i. e., primary and eodiagenetic gypsum), and the low diagenetic modification recorded for the limestones. Results of these approaches show that expansion/contraction cycles in both studied areas were accompanied by significant changes in isotope values. The wide dispersion of Sr and S isotope data within individual depositional cycles reinforces the lack of significant diagenetic modification as suggested by the petrographic analysis, and confirms the utility of these isotopes as environmental tools. Additionally, a non-marine brine source is suggested by 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios ranging from 0. 707824 to 0. 709280, which are higher than those from late Aptian seawater (i. e., between 0. 70720 and 0. 70735). The δ 34 S varies from 16. 12 to 17. 89 %o(V-CDT) in the Codó area, which is also in disagreement with late Aptian marine values (ranging from 13 to 16 %o(V-CDT)). Both geochemical tracers were influenced by facies characteristics, and thus a model is provided where expansion of saline pan/lake systems led to decreasing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values due to the inhibition of the 87 Sr from clay minerals originated during the internal draining of mudflats. During expansion peaks, the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values were lower due to submergence of mud flats and introduction of external 87 Sr-depleted waters related to weathering of Permian to Neocomian marine limestones and evaporites, as well as Triassic to Neocomian basaltic rocks. Furthermore, the sulphur isotope values decrease in the southern margin of the basin from 14. 79 to 15. 60 %o(V-CDT) probably due to increased evaporation in shallower water settings. While the studies of Sr and S isotopes emphasized the evaporites of the Codó Formation, the analysis of C and O isotopes were carried out on the carbonates. The data revealed a wide distribution of dominantly low δ 13 C and δ 18 O values, ranging from – 5. 69 ‰ to – 13. 02 ‰ and from – 2. 71 ‰ to – 10. 80 ‰, respectively. It was also observed that these ratios vary according to seismically-induced shallowing-upward cycles, in general becoming lighter in their bases, where central lake deposits dominate, and progressively heavier upward, where marginal lake deposits are more widespread. In addition to confirm a depositional signature for the analysed samples, this behavior led to introduce a seismic-induced isotope model. Hence, lighter isotope ratios appear to be related with flooding events promoted by subsidence, which resulted in the development of a perennial lake system, while heavier isotope values are related to ephemeral lake phases favored through uplift and/or increased stability. Furthermore, the results show that a closed lake system dominated, as indicated by the overall good positive covariance (i. e., + 0. 42 to + 0. 43) between the carbon and oxygen isotopes, though open phases are also recorded by negative covariance values of – 0. 36. A Formação Codó, objeto deste estudo, corresponde a uma unidade geológica neoaptiana bem conhecida por ser o único registro exposto de rochas desta idade na margem equatorial brasileira. Esta formação, constituída de folhelhos betuminosos, calcários e evaporitos, é particularmente bem exposta nas bordas sul e leste da Bacia de São Luís-Grajaú, MA, áreas aqui investigadas com o intuito: 1. de aprimorar o entendimento do sistema deposicional, discutindo-se a hipótese de formação em ambientes lacustres; e 2. reconstituir as condições paleohidrológicas com base na integração de dados faciológicos, estratigráficos, petrográficos e isotópicos (C, O, Sr e S). Os dados de campo confirmaram sistema lacustre para a área de Codó, onde se desenvolveram lagos salinos, estáveis, bem estratificados, e com períodos de fechamento, quando prevaleceram condições anóxicas acompanhadas pela precipitação de sais em subambientes de lago central. Na região de Grajaú, por outro lado, prevaleceram condições mais efêmeras, com desenvolvimento de complexo de sabkha/saline pan, e precipitação de evaporitos principalmente nas margens do sistema, sob condições de salinas marginais|$|R
