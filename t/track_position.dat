5|$|At {{the first}} night race in Formula One, the , Webber {{qualified}} in 13th position. Red Bull pulled in both Webber and David Coulthard for their pit stops {{as soon as they}} could when the safety car came on track, due to Nelson Piquet, Jr. crashing, giving them both great <b>track</b> <b>position.</b> This led to Webber running in 2nd place before a gearbox issue put him out of the race on lap 29.|$|E
5|$|At the start, Hamilton {{assumed the}} lead while a three-car wide tussle at turn one, {{involving}} Kimi Räikkönen, Felipe Nasr and Pastor Maldonado, resulted in Maldonado crashing out at turn two and race officials deploying the safety car. The next lap, Romain Grosjean's car failed thus taking both Lotus cars {{out of the}} race. Normal racing resumed on lap four, with Carlos Sainz Jr. falling back from fifth to his starting position in seventh place after being passed by Nasr and Daniel Ricciardo. Nasr also lost <b>track</b> <b>position</b> after being ordered by his team to relinquish a position for overtaking while still under safety car conditions.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{the short}} track relay team won Australia's first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze. They {{qualified}} for the four-team final after edging out Japan and New Zealand, finishing second in their semi-final. The quartet adopted a plan of staying on their feet as the first priority, and remaining undisqualified and defeating {{at least one of}} the other three finalists. During the race, the Canadians fell and lost a significant amount of time, meaning that Australia would win a medal if they raced conservatively and avoided a crash. Late in the race, Nizielski was fighting with his American counterpart for <b>track</b> <b>position</b> to claim the silver medal, but took the safe option and yielded, mindful of the lost opportunity of the crash in Albertville. It was a successful campaign for the largest team that Australia had sent—apart from 1960. The 27 athletes recorded an unprecedented five top 10 finishes. Marshall placed first in the opening round of the aerials, but faded to sixth in the final, while Kerryn Rim placed eighth in the 15km biathlon and Steven Bradbury and Nizielski of the medal-winning relay team placed eighth and tenth in the 500m and 1,000m short track events respectively. In contrast to the previous games, the Australian short track speed skaters placed in the top half of the field in six of their eight individual starts. However, the Australians in the remaining disciplines generally finished in the bottom half of their competition.|$|E

The {{following}} week at Talladega, Earnhardt raced among the pack {{until the middle of}} the race, when he took the lead.

25|$|According {{to track}} {{historian}} Donald Davidson, no protests were filed {{at the end}} of the race and Mulford offered congratulations to Harroun in the Detroit Free Press newspaper on June 4. Davidson has also pointed out that Mulford was reported by contemporary publications to have changed 14 tires during the course of the race, including one from a blown tire in turn one. Changing tires at the time was a lengthy and painstaking process, as the wheels were typically not removable. Tires had to be pried off of the rims, remounted, and inflated - all using hand tools, and in the precarious confines of the primitive pit stalls. Mulford himself even understood and admitted that he lost at least 14 minutes of <b>track</b> <b>position</b> due to his numerous pit stops.|$|E

25|$|The long-standing {{rule was}} that the pit lane {{remained}} open during safety car incidents, and because the cars had to travel slowly behind the safety car, teams took advantage of this to pit immediately and re-enter the race with less loss of <b>track</b> <b>position.</b> However, the regulations in 2008 ruled that the pit lane was closed until all cars were {{picked up by the}} safety car, meaning that the advantage of the lead cars would be eliminated before they were able to pit, and afterwards they would re-enter the race {{at the back of the}} queue. Under the previous regulations, the leaders could quickly pit before they were hauled up and their lead eliminated, meaning that they could still resume a front-running position. Some drivers needed to stop while the pits were closed to avoid running out of fuel, so they were handed penalties for their infractions.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{only two}} non-Cup Series regulars won a race during the 35-race schedule: David Gilliland and Paul Menard. Menard and Johnny Sauter {{were the only}} Busch Series regulars to finish in the top-10 in points that season. In 2007, only three Busch drivers scored a victory: Aric Almirola, Stephen Leicht and Jason Leffler. Almirola's victory at the Milwaukee Mile on June 23 was {{controversial}} and unusual, as Almirola was pulled from his pole-winning car after leading 42 of the first 58 laps {{to make room for}} Cup regular Denny Hamlin, due to obligations with sponsor Rockwell Automation which is headquartered in Milwaukee. Hamlin was scheduled to compete in a Cup event at Infineon Raceway the same weekend, and had several delays in his trek from California to Wisconsin. Despite the loss in <b>track</b> <b>position</b> due to the driver change, Hamlin got back to the front to take the checkered flag after 250 laps. Almirola was officially credited with the win because he made the start, but did not participate in victory celebrations.|$|E
25|$|After {{blowing the}} tire on turn one, Mulford had to limp {{around the track}} for almost an entire lap, and {{subsequently}} bent the rim. That necessitated an even longer pit stop at that juncture to hammer out the damage. The accounts from the newspapers claim that Harroun changed only four tires all day during only three pit stops. Harroun's team changed the right rear tire three times, and one other unspecified tire. Harroun's shorter elapsed time in the pits is alone considered sufficient to more than overcome any <b>track</b> <b>position</b> advantage Mulford might have been thought to have. But the undermining evidence to support Harroun as the rightful winner was the team strategy to run a constant 75mph pace, regardless of position, {{in order to save}} tire wear. During the 1910 Wheeler-Schebler Trophy Race, as well as during test runs in May 1911, Harroun discovered that by merely running a constant 75 mph pace instead of an 80 mph (or faster) pace, he would substantially reduce his tire wear and increase tire life.|$|E

Some variations of the <b>tracking</b> <b>position</b> work well for some individuals and not so well for others.

25|$|On the {{following}} lap, a large crash necessitated {{the deployment of}} the safety car. Jefferies was defending his position from Sato on the straight linking turns three and four and Sato went into Jefferies's rear-end. Sato punted Jefferies into a heavy collision with the wall lining the circuit at high speed. Jefferies's vehicle then slid across the tarmac at turn one and stopped in the gravel trap without collecting any other cars. Jefferies was unhurt. At the lap six restart, Vandoorne remained the leader but Richelmi, Coletti, Haryanto and Nasr elected to make pit stops for the mandatory change to the hard compound tyre. Evans and Palmer made their pit stops on {{the following}} lap, though Vandoorne committed himself to making <b>track</b> <b>position</b> pay off and extended his advantage to five seconds in front of Pic who were also required to make their pit stops. Richelmi lost positions but his teammate Palmer moved back up the field and into third position. Nasr became disgruntled when Cecotto forced him {{to the side of}} the track while battling for position. Vandoorne ceded first place to Berthon at the end of lap nine when he made his pit stop and rejoined with a two-second advantage over Palmer.|$|E
