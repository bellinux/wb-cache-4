5|$|Before {{the event}} began, a thirty-minute pre-show aired with a match between The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens) and Mikey Batts and Jerrelle Clark. The Naturals won the match by pinfall, after Stevens and Douglas lifted Batts up, placed Batts {{head and neck}} onto one of <b>their</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> fell to a seated {{position}} to perform a move they dubbed the Natural Disaster.|$|E
5|$|The {{first six}} seasons {{featured}} sixteen fighters, in either {{one or two}} weight categories. The first two seasons, however, were very different from each following season. The original format for The Ultimate Fighter saw each team compete in challenges, such as hoisting their respective coach up on <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> sprinting down a beach, or a team tug-of-war. These challenges resulted in eliminations of fighters who hadn't fought, {{until late in the}} season when the challenge incentive was to select the next fight where fighters would be eliminated, having lost the fight. In the first two seasons, fighters would also leave the house for good upon losing and this often resulted in odd numbers for teams, which forced the moving of fighters to opposing teams.|$|E
5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam are bipedal Pokémon {{characterized}} by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox-like appearance. They {{look like they}} are wearing armor, as they have two pauldron-shaped pieces on <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> a fauld-like piece around their chest. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam have three fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot, with two toes in the front on either side {{and one in the}} back near the ankle. Abra and Kadabra also have thick tails the same gold color as the rest of its body, except for a brown band located near the top. Kadabra and Alakazam have relatively large mustaches, which are shorter in female species. Kadabra has a red star-shaped symbol on its forehead, and three red wavy lines on its fauld-like torso. After evolving into Alakazam, the creatures no longer have the Zener markings and tails, while their heads become much larger, resulting in extremely powerful mental powers. Alakazam undergoes slight changes upon Mega Evolving into Mega Alakazam, as its overall color scheme becomes slightly paler, it gains a white beard alongside its now white mustache, a considerably thinner torso, and a red gem-like organ on its forehead.|$|E

50|$|The attacking wrestler drapes an {{opponent}} over <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> in a fireman's carry position and then {{takes hold of}} the opponent and pulls them over <b>their</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> down to the mat while falling {{to a sitting position}} so that the opponent lands on their upper back and neck between the legs of the wrestler, facing towards them. A cross-legged and wrist-clutch version of this move also exists.|$|R
60|$|And the colliers' sweethearts would, like herself, hang {{their heads}} back limp over <b>their</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> look {{out from the}} dark archway, at the close patch of yellow lights on the unseen hill in the distance, or at the vague form of trees, and at the {{buildings}} of the colliery wood-yard, in the other direction.|$|R
25|$|Patients usually regain {{function}} in <b>their</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> experience less pain, following surgery. For some, however, the joint continues to hurt. Weakness and a {{limited range of}} motion also may persist. Those who report such symptoms frequently are diagnosed with failed rotator cuff syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The UAE has {{a modest}} dress code. The dress code {{is part of}} Dubai's {{criminal}} law. Most malls in the UAE have a dress code displayed at entrances. At Dubai's malls, females should cover <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> knees; therefore women {{are not permitted to}} wear sleeveless tops. People can also wear swimwear at the pools and beaches.|$|E
25|$|The hips {{should be}} relaxed and the rider should lean {{forwards}} slightly {{with the movement}} of the horse. In cross country, the rider tends {{to stay out of the}} saddle and be standing up with their knees bent and the upper body leaning over the horse's withers. The heel of the rider should be in line with <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> then the back of their riding hat in dressage to make the canter look neat.|$|E

50|$|Further to this; {{letters on}} {{shoulders}} will denote borough or newly formed basic command units {{and not the}} police station an officer is based from. An example {{of this would be}} a PC working from East Ham Police Station in the borough of Newham; the PC would have KF (Newham) on <b>their</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> not KE (East Ham station). Similarly in newly merged boroughs a PC working from Holloway Police Station would have CN (Central North BCU) on <b>their</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|R
25|$|Then the swimmer shrugs <b>their</b> <b>{{shoulders}}</b> <b>and</b> throws {{their arms}} and shoulders forward, lunging cat-like {{back into the water}} (though the emphasis is to go forward, not down). As the swimmer sinks, they arch their back, and kicks. Timing is very important in order for the kick to transfer all of its force via the arched back, but the optimum time is when the arms are 3/4 extended. Then the swimmer kicks and presses on their chest, undulating a little underwater, and squeezing the gluteus maximus to prevent the legs and feet from rising out of the water. The swimmer has now returned to the streamlined position, and the cycle starts again.|$|E
25|$|The {{heart the}} city, around the Île de la Cité, was {{a maze of}} narrow, winding streets and {{crumbling}} buildings from earlier centuries; it was picturesque, but dark, crowded, unhealthy and dangerous. Water was distributed by porters carrying buckets from a pole on <b>their</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> the sewers emptied directly into the Seine. A cholera outbreak in 1832 killed twenty thousand people. The Comte de Rambuteau, the Prefect of the Seine for fifteen years under Louis-Philippe, made tentative {{efforts to improve the}} center of the city: he paved the quays of the Seine with stone paths and planted trees along the river. He built a new street (now the Rue Rambuteau) to connect the Le Marais district with the markets and began construction of Les Halles, the famous central market of Paris, which was finished by Napoleon III.|$|E
500|$|After {{seeing the}} violence, Ali al-Ghanmi, a police officer, left his guard post {{and joined the}} crowd, announcing to them that {{he could no longer}} support [...] "a killer institution."

50|$|There are two {{subspecies}} of {{the southern}} crowned pigeon, differentiated by <b>their</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> belly colorations. Goura scheepmakeri sclateri of southwest New Guinea with maroon <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> blue-grey belly, and the nominate race Goura scheepmakeri scheepmakeri of southeast New Guinea with blue-grey <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> maroon below. It also looks very similar to its relatives, the Victoria crowned pigeon, and the western crowned pigeon.This species was first discovered new to science by Otto Finsch who found a live bird received from the dealer C. Scheepmaker in Amsterdam Zoo and named it after him.|$|R
50|$|The Cornhuskers {{opened the}} new season with a chip on <b>their</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> {{completely}} smashed Nebraska Wesleyan {{in a bit of}} revenge for being held to just 21 points in the previous year's shutout win over NWU. This was the fourth and final time Nebraska scored 100 or more points {{in the history of the}} program, the previous coming in 1911 in a 117-0 blanking of Kearney State. NWU remained winless against Nebraska, 0-7.|$|R
500|$|If {{the players}} do not input any {{commands}} for a time, the game attempts a self-referencing action to draw their attentions: the barbarians turn {{to face the}} players, shrug <b>their</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> say [...] "C'mon". [...] The game awards points for successful attacks; the more complex the move, the higher the score awarded. [...] A score board displays the highest points achieved for the game.|$|E
500|$|The Constitution {{described}} {{the scene as}} Dorsey emerged from the steps of city hall: [...] "The solicitor reached no farther than the sidewalk. While mounted men rode like Cossacks through the human swarm, three muscular men slung Mr. Dorsey on <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> passed him {{over the heads of}} the crowd across the street." [...] Albert Lindemann suggests [...] "the powerless experienced a moment of exhilaration in seeing the defeat and humiliation of a normally powerful and inaccessible oppressor." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accident}} sent {{thick black}} smoke billowing above the airport {{as more than}} 200 emergency workers ... had to contend not only with blustery snow but the powerful icy current in Flushing Bay ... the tense drama of the rescue continued into the early hours, with fire-fighters and police officers in water up to <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> helicopters shining spotlights on the wreckage and an ice-covered mound of earth {{at the end of}} the runway so slick the rescue workers needed metal ladders to walk across it.|$|E

500|$|High {{says that}} the gods were [...] "angered by this arrogance" [...] and that the gods had the two placed in the heavens. There, the {{children}} were made to drive the horses Árvakr and Alsviðr that drew the chariot of the sun. High {{says that the}} gods had created the chariot to illuminate the worlds from burning embers flying from the fiery world of Muspelheim. In order to cool the horses, the gods placed two bellows beneath <b>their</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> that [...] "according to the same lore" [...] these bellows are called Ísarnkol.|$|E
500|$|Bryan later {{described}} the silence as [...] "really painful" [...] and momentarily {{thought he had}} failed. As he moved towards his seat, the Coliseum burst into pandemonium. Delegates threw hats, coats, and handkerchiefs into the air. Others took up the standards with the state names on them with each delegation, and planted them by Nebraska's. Two alert police officers had joined Bryan {{as he left the}} podium, anticipating the crush. The policemen were swept away by the flood of delegates, who raised Bryan to <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> carried him around the floor. The Washington Post newspaper recorded, [...] "bedlam broke loose, delirium reigned supreme." ...|$|E
500|$|MIT {{students}} {{who attended the}} game to cheer against Harvard tore down the goalposts and hoisted him on <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> for decades afterward, it was known as [...] "football's upset of the century". Tulane coach Clark Shaughnessy later wrote that the win [...] "first awoke the nation to the possibilities of Southern football." [...] Students painted the [...] "impossible formula" [...] of C6H0 around Danville, and the campus post office has a last vestige of the graffiti on its side. On the return celebration in Danville on Monday, Governor Edwin P. Morrow remarked [...] "I'd rather be Bo McMillin this moment than the Governor of Kentucky." ...|$|E
5|$|Their feet {{have four}} long toes and an opposable big toe. Orangutans can grasp things with both {{their hands and}} their feet. Their fingers and toes are curved, {{allowing}} them {{to get a better}} grip on branches. Since their hip joints have the same flexibility as <b>their</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> arm joints, orangutans have less restriction in the movements of their legs than humans have. Unlike gorillas and chimpanzees, orangutans are not true knuckle-walkers, and are instead fist-walkers.|$|R
50|$|Both {{eventually}} {{move out}} of the condo. Gary begins taking {{a more active role in}} his tour guide business, while Brooke travels the world, eventually returning to Chicago. Some time later, they meet again by chance on the street as Gary is bringing home groceries and Brooke is on her way to a meeting. After some awkward but friendly catching up, they part ways but each glances back over <b>their</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> they share a smile.|$|R
50|$|The {{attacker}} {{stands behind}} and {{to one side}} of the opponent. The attacker wraps one arm around the waist of the opponent and grabs the back of the opponent's near leg with their other arm. The attacker then lifts the opponent on to <b>their</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> then falls backwards, driving the opponent into the mat at a high angle. This move was used by Shawn Michaels in his early career as a finisher and was named the Teardrop Suplex.|$|R
500|$|Malini Mannath of The New Indian Express noted Enthiran {{for having}} [...] "An {{engaging}} script, brilliant special effects, and a debonair hero who still carries his charisma effortlessly." [...] Karthik Subramanian of The Hindu observed that actors [...] "tend {{to get lost}} in special effects movies." [...] Subramanian believed it was not the case in Enthiran: [...] "Rajinikanth and [...] carry the movie on <b>their</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> considering the fact that much of the acting must have been in front of green screens, one has to say that nothing looks artificial right through." [...] In contrast, Gautaman Bhaskaran of Hindustan Times rated it two out of five stars, writing that [...] "Shankar's work slips into a loud, overdramatic and exaggerated mess".|$|E
500|$|Fillmore oversaw two highly {{competent}} Secretaries of State, Daniel Webster, {{and after}} the New Englander's 1852 death, Edward Everett, looking over <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> making all major decisions. The president was particularly active in Asia and the Pacific, {{especially with regard to}} Japan, which at this time still prohibited nearly all foreign contact. American merchants and shipowners wanted Japan [...] "opened up" [...] for trade. [...] This would allow not only commerce, but permit American ships to call there for food and water, and in emergencies without being punished. They were concerned that American sailors cast away on the Japanese coast were imprisoned as criminals. [...] Fillmore and Webster dispatched Commodore Matthew C. Perry to open Japan to relations with the outside world, by force if necessary. Though the commodore did not reach Japan until after the end of Fillmore's term, Fillmore ordered the Perry Expedition.|$|E
500|$|Urged on by a {{small but}} loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans {{improved}} after the break and, according to Byrom, [...] "ke the Austrian goal under siege" [...] throughout the second half. [...] With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a short corner that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans [...] "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. Gillian Cowley made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's free hit was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [...] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported [...] "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" [...] at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other". Finally they hoisted Grant onto <b>their</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> carried her off the field.|$|E
50|$|The wrestler applies a front facelock to the {{opponent}} and hooks {{the opponent}}'s near arm over <b>their</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> lifts {{them into a}} vertical suplex position. They then turn the opponent 180°, force the opponent into the reverse piledriver position, then drop to a sitting position, dropping the opponent on their head. This move was innovated by Scott Steiner, who called it Steiner Screwdriver. It s also used by Brian Cage who calls it the Drill Claw.|$|R

60|$|So {{the witch}} saw {{there was no}} help to be got from her old servants, and {{that the best thing}} she could do was to mount on her broom and set off in pursuit of the {{children}}.
