By using pairs of monoclonal antibodies to the T-cell subset markers CD 4 (Th) and CD 8 [T suppressor/cytotoxic cell (Ts) ] and the common leukocyte markers Lp 220 and Lp 95 - 150, five phenotypically distinct T-cell subsets {{have been identified in}} peripheral blood: two CD 4 + Th cell subsets and three CD 8 + Ts cell subsets. The frequencies and absolute numbers of these five populations were measured in patients with active and inactive MS and were compared with those in healthy age-matched controls and in patients with other neurologic diseases. A high frequency of patients with active MS (80 %) had a selective reduction of one Th subset (CD 4 + Lp 220 +) compared with normal controls (P less than 0. 001) or patients with inactive MS (P less than 0. 001). Three patients examined sequentially had a further loss of the Lp 220 + Th subset as disease activity progressed. The proportion of two Ts subsets was also abnormal in patients with active MS, but this defect was not restricted to that group. <b>Total</b> <b>Th</b> and <b>Ts</b> cell frequencies and Th/Ts ratios were not significantly different between patient and normal control groups.

This condition is identifiable by the oral mucosa patch test (omPT), a qualitative and subjective examination that requires clinical expertise. Our {{aim was to}} evaluate if a peripheral blood lymphocyte typing performed {{before and after the}} omPT for Ni may be able to objectify this examination for diagnostic purposes. Thirty patients with symptoms referable to the ingestion of Ni-rich foods were subjected to omPT for Ni. Before and after the omPT, each patient underwent blood sampling for the typing of total lymphocytes and their subsets (T, <b>T</b> helper or <b>Th,</b> <b>T</b> cytotoxic or Tc, B, natural killer or NK). Statistical analysis was performed by Student t test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. According to the omPT outcomes, 18 patients were defined as Ni-sensitive and the remaining 12 as controls.

A significant increase in median CD 70 þCD 4 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cell frequencies and memory CD 45 RA 2 CD 4 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cell frequencies was observed in SLE samples as compared to healthy controls.

40|$|One of the {{obstacles}} for cancer immunotherapy is the ineffi-ciency of CD 8 þ T-cell recruitment to tumors. STAT 3 {{has been shown to}} suppress CD 8 þ T-cell antitumor functions in various cancermodels, in part by restricting accumulationofCD 8 þT cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism by which STAT 3 in CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells inhibits their accumulation in tumors remains to be defined. Here, we show that STAT 3 signaling in CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells inhibits chemokine CXCL 10 production by tumor-associated myeloid cells by reducing IFNg expression by T cells. We further demonstrate that ablating STAT 3 in T cells allows expression of CXCR 3, the receptor of CXCL 10, on CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells, resulting in efficient accumulation of CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells at tumor sites. Blocking IFNg or CXCR 3 impairs the accumulation of STAT 3 -deficient CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells in tumor and their antitumor effects. Together, our study reveals a negative regulation by STAT 3 signaling in T cells on cross-talk between myeloid cells and T cells through IFNg/ CXCR 3 /CXCL 10, which is important for CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells homing to tumors.

40|$|An {{impaired}} antitumor immunity {{is found}} in patients with cancer and represents a major obstacle in the successful development of different forms of immunotherapy. Signaling through Notch receptors regulates the differentiation and function of many cell types, including immune cells. However, the effect of Notch in CD 8 þ T-cell responses in tumors remains unclear. Thus, we aimed to determine the role of Notch signaling in CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells in the induction of tumor-induced suppression. Our results using conditional knockout mice show that Notch- 1 and Notch- 2 were critical for the proliferation and IFNg production of activated CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells and were significantly decreased in tumor-infiltrating T cells. Conditional transgenic expression of Notch- 1 intracellular domain (N 1 IC) in antigen-specific CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells did not affect activation or proliferation of CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells, but induced a central memory phenotype and increased cytotoxicity effects and granzyme B levels. Consequently, a higher antitumor response and resistance to tumor-induced tolerancewere found after adoptive transfer of N 1 IC-transgenic CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells into tumor-bearing mice. Additional results showed that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) blocked the expression of Notch- 1 and Notch- 2 in T cells through nitric oxide–dependent mechanisms. Interestingly, N 1 IC overexpression rendered CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells resistant to the tolerogenic effect induced byMDSC in vivo. Together, the results suggest the key role of Notch in the suppression of CD 8 þT-cell responses in tumors and the therapeutic potential of N 1 IC in antigen-specific CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells to reverse T-cell suppression and increase the efficacy of T cell–based immunotherapies in cancer.

Slow-progressing children (SPC) provide an exceptional resource for the investigation and clarification of the immunological and virological mechanisms of natural control of HIV infection {{and can be used}} to investigate prognostic indicators of disease progression. Objectives: To investigate the immune activation status and T regulatory (Treg) cell levels in SPC. Study design: A cross-sectional study was carried out on 28 children 8 years old and older who were vertically infected with HIV. The children were stratified into 3 groups according to their clinical outcome: SPC (anti-retroviral-therapy-naı̈ve; 8 years-old; CD 4 20 %; viral load < 25, 000 copies), IF/VF (anti-retroviral-therapy but with no therapeutic response), and IS/VS (anti-retroviral therapy with good therapeutic response). Uninfected children (NI) were assessed as healthy control group. Results: A higher percentage of activated CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells were found in all HIV infected children, regardless of the evolution of disease. The activation of CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells was not associated with either viral load or the percentage of CD 4 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells.

40|$|Summary: The strict {{limit in}} proliferative {{potential}} of normal {{human somatic cells}} – {{a process known as}} replicative senescence – is highly relevant to the immune system, because clonal expansion is fundamental to adaptive immunity. CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells that undergo extensive rounds of antigen-driven proliferation in cell culture invariably reach the end stage of replicative senescence, characterized by irreversible cell-cycle arrest and a critically short telomere length. Cultures of senescent CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells also show resistance to apoptosis, permanent loss of CD 28 expres-sion, altered cytokine profiles, reduced ability to respond to stress, and various functional changes. Cells with similar characteristics accumulate during normal aging as well as in younger persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus, suggesting that the process of replicative senes-cence is not an artifact of cell culture but is also occurring in vivo. Interestingly, in elderly persons, the presence of high proportions of CD 8 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells with characteristics of replicative senescence is correlated with reduced antibody responses to vaccines as well as with osteoporotic fractures. CD 8 þCD 28 – T cells also accumulate in patients with certain types of cancer.

In this study, we focused on a comparison of regulatory Foxp 3 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells and programmed death- 1 (PD- 1) <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells in the microenvironment of tumors thatwere positive or negative forHPV, in two groups thatwerematched for various clinical and biologic parameters. HPV-positive head and neck cancers were more heavily infiltrated by regulatory T cells and PD- 1 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells and the levels of PD- 1 þ cells were positively correlated with a favorable clinical outcome. In explaining this paradoxical result, we showed that these PD- 1 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> cells expressed activation markers and were functional after blockade of the PD- 1 –PD-L 1 axis in vitro. Approximately 50 % of PD- 1 <b>þ</b> tumor-infiltrating <b>T</b> cells lacked Tim- 3 expression andmay indeed represent activated T cells. Inmice, administration of a cancer vaccine increased PD- 1 on T cells with concomitant tumor regression. In this setting, PD- 1 blockade synergized with vaccine in eliciting antitumor efficacy.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the immunophenotype of pulmonary TB granulomas from autopsied patients with tuberculosis (TB group) and from HIV patients with tuberculosis (TB/HIV group), {{and to identify}} the Mycobacterium species using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. METHODS: Lung samples of 15 TB group patients and 23 TB/HIV group patients were selected. Histopathologic analyses and immunohistochemistry tests were performed to {{describe the}} granulomas and to detect the infectious agent (anti-BCG). CD 4, CD 8, CD 20 and CD 68 were evaluated to characterize the immnophenotype of the granulomas. Polymerase Chain Reaction was performed to identify the mycobacterium species. RESULTS: CD 4 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> lymphocytes were the cells with highest density in the TB group, whereas CD 68 cells exhibited the highest density in the TB/HIV group. Comparison between groups showed that the CD 4 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> density was significantly higher in the TB patients; whereas, CD 68 density was significantly higher in the TB/HIV patients. M. tuberculosiswas identified in 8 cases of each group;M. aviumwas only found in one case of the TB/HIV group. CONCLUSION:With the advent of AIDS, the immunological profile of TB has changed. This {{may be associated with}} the depletion of CD 4 <b>þ</b> <b>T</b> lymphocytes in lung granulomas. M. tuberculosiswas themajor etiological agent of TB in both groups...|$|R

We have previously shown that <b>Th</b> 2 <b>T</b> cells bearing the same T cell receptor (TCR) as the diabetogenic <b>Th</b> 1 <b>T</b> cells invade islets in neonatal nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice but fail to cause disease. Moreover, when mixed in excess and cotransferred with <b>Th</b> 1 <b>T</b> cells, <b>Th</b> 2 <b>T</b> cells could not protect NOD neonates from Th 1 -mediated diabetes. We have now found, to our great surprise, the same <b>Th</b> 2 <b>T</b> cells that produced a harmless insulitis in neonatal NOD mice produced intense and generalized pancreatitis and insulitis associated with islet cell necrosis, abscess formation, and subsequent diabetes when transferred into immunocompromised NOD. scid mice. These lesions resembled allergic inflamation and contained a large eosinophilic infiltrate. Moreover, the Th 2 -mediated destruction of islet cells was mediated by local interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) production but not by IL- 4. These findings indicate that under certain conditions <b>Th</b> 2 <b>T</b> cells may not produce a benign or protective insulitis but rather acute pathology and disease. Additionally, these results lead us to question the feasibility of Th 2 -based therapy in type I diabetes, especially in immunosuppressed recipients of islet cell transplants...|$|R

We show that NADþ regulates CD 4 þ T-cell differentiation through tryptophan hydroxylase- 1 (Tph 1), independently of well-established transcription factors. In the presence of NADþ, the frequency of T-bet / CD 4 þ IFNgþ Tcells was twofold higher than wild-type CD 4 þ Tcells cultured in conventional T helper 1 polarizing conditions. Our findings unravel a new pathway orchestrating CD 4 þ T-cell differentiation and demonstrate that NADþ may serve as...|$|R
