5|$|Front {{tracking}} {{methods have}} long been used in fluid dynamics to model and track the motion of boundaries between different materials, of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts, or of shock waves within a single material. These methods involve deriving the equations of motion of <b>the</b> <b>boundary,</b> and using them to directly simulate the motion of <b>the</b> <b>boundary,</b> rather than simulating the underlying fluid and treating <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> as an emergent property of the fluid. The same methods {{can also be used}} to simulate the curve-shortening flow, even when the curve undergoing the flow is not a boundary or shock.|$|E

5|$|The South Forty-Foot Drain {{serves as}} a {{district}} boundary over the length where it runs roughly south to north.

North of Donington, <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> between the borough of Boston {{to the east and}} North Kesteven to the west follows the line of the Drain. As the Drain crosses the line of the Midfen Dyke, just before the Nottingham to Boston railway joins it at Great Hale pumping station, <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> turns northwards, following its medieval course.|$|E
5|$|The {{occurrence}} of planktonic foraminifera across the K–Pg boundary {{has been studied}} since the 1930s.

5|$|At high Reynolds numbers, {{typical of}} {{full-sized}} aircraft, {{it is desirable}} to have a laminar boundary layer. This results in a lower skin friction due to the characteristic velocity profile of laminar flow. However, <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> layer inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the body, and eventually becomes turbulent, the process known as boundary layer transition. One {{way of dealing with}} this problem is to suck <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> layer away through a porous surface (see Boundary layer suction). This can reduce drag, but is usually impractical due to its mechanical complexity and the power required to move the air and dispose of it. Natural laminar flow techniques push <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> layer transition aft by reshaping the aerofoil or fuselage so that its thickest point is more aft and less thick. This reduces the velocities in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater length.|$|E

5|$|Copperbelt was a {{province}} in Northern Rhodesia which was rich in deposits of the mineral. Cecil John Rhodes, a British capitalist and empire builder, {{was the leading}} light of British expansion north of the Limpopo River into south-central Africa. In 1895, Rhodes asked his American scout Frederick Russell Burnham to look for minerals and how to improve river navigation in the region; during this trek, Burnham discovered large copper deposits along the Kafue River. Rhodes brought British influence into the region by obtaining mineral rights from local chiefs through questionable treaties. The Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891, signed in Lisbon on 11 June 1891 by the United Kingdom and Portugal, fixed <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> between territories administered by the British South Africa Company (BSAC) in North-Eastern Rhodesia and Portuguese Mozambique. It also fixed <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> between the BSAC-administered territory of North-Western Rhodesia (now in Zambia) and Portuguese Angola, although <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> with Angola was not marked on the ground until later. The northern border of the British territory in North-Eastern Rhodesia and the British Central Africa Protectorate was agreed in an 1890 Anglo-German treaty which also fixed the (very short) boundary between North-Western Rhodesia and German South-West Africa, now Namibia. <b>The</b> <b>boundary</b> between the Congo Free State and British territory was fixed by an 1894 treaty, although minor adjustments were made until the 1930s. The border between the British Central Africa Protectorate and North-Eastern Rhodesia was fixed in 1891 at the drainage divide between Lake Malawi and the Luangwa River, and <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> between North-Western Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia became the Zambezi River in 1898.
