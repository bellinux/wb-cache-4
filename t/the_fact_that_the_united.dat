5|$|After {{some notable}} successes and some early {{failures}} in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. The credibility of the organization was somewhat weakened by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States never officially joined the League and the Soviet Union joined late and only briefly. Germany withdrew from the League, as did Japan, Italy, Spain, and others. The onset of the Second World War showed that the League had failed its primary purpose, which was to prevent any future world war. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations (UN) replaced it {{after the end of}} the Second World War and inherited several agencies and organisations founded by the League.|$|E
5|$|After the election, {{many analysts}} {{concluded}} {{that it was the}} unity of the opposition parties against Congress, missing in the 1962 elections, that made the difference. The victory is attributed to the electoral alliance between DMK and Rajaji. Even though Congress had done an effective job of managing the state of Madras, the effective grass roots campaigning by the DMK and the political acumen of Annadurai, defeated the Congress and its leader M. Bhaktavatsalam. The popularity of the United Front was so large {{that they were able to}} win an absolute majority in ten out of the 14 districts in the state, while Congress could not accomplish that in a single district. This was largely due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Front was able to capitalize on its growing support in large towns and cities, combined with the decline in Congress support in its traditional Schedule Caste constituencies.|$|E

During the Gulf War, the economy of India went through an extremely difficult phase. The Government of India adopted liberalised economic systems.

[...] Deny Flight and other early operations [...] "forced the Allies {{to consider the}} question of NATO's military responsibility for territory outside of its traditional defense perimeter, {{and it was one}} over which they were deeply divided". [...] Disagreements between the United States and its European allies over when and how to use air power [...] "made intra-alliance diplomacy more problematic" [...] during the period. [...] Many of these problems in the relationship were the result of concerns from European nations who had forces on the ground in UNPROFOR that might be taken hostage.

[...] John Henry Wigmore said that the creation of the Court [...] "should have given every lawyer a thrill of cosmic vibration", and James Brown Scott wrote that [...] "the one dream of our ages has been realised in our time".

The Court applied the Insular Cases, by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, by virtue of its complete jurisdiction and control, maintains de facto sovereignty over this territory, while Cuba retained ultimate sovereignty over the territory, to hold that the aliens detained as enemy combatants on that territory were entitled to the writ of habeas corpus protected in Article I, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution. The lower court had expressly indicated that no constitutional rights (not merely the right to habeas) extend to the Guantanamo detainees, rejecting petitioners' arguments, but the Supreme Court held that fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution extend to the Guantanamo detainees as well. Invoking Marbury v. Madison (1803), the Court concluded: [...] "The Nation’s basic charter cannot be contracted away like this. The Constitution grants Congress and the President the power to acquire, dispose of, and govern territory, not the power to decide when and where its terms apply.
