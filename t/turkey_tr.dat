40|$|In this paper, I {{consider}} two heterogeneous economies {{that engage}} in a currency union. The small economy adopts the currency of the large and is highly dependent on its wealthier partner for trade. The effects of a currency union, deficit financing and institutional restraints on inflation are analyzed in a dual economy with different wage-setting mechanisms. In the model, Northern Cyprus is the small economy and Turkey, being the only country that acknowledges it as an independent state is its larger partner. Features of the labour markets determine the wages. We make a conjecture that wage determination in Northern Cyprus (NC) is conducted with reference to centralized-bargaining and that decentralized bargaining sets the wages in <b>Turkey</b> (<b>TR).</b> Hence, the differences in wage-setting procedures cause a dual labour market. In order to incorporate monetary dependence into the analysis, we let the Turkish central bank {{to decide on the}} economic policy measures, in this case the inflation rate and unemployment. The institutional restraints such as economic sanctions increase the inflexibility in the NC and cause shocks to affect the economy more. In order to compensate for the losses that might be endured by the government in NC, TR finances the budget deficit of NC. Therefore, TR government needs to consider the burden of this financing issue. ...|$|E

This study focuses on the diversity of wild plants found in open markets in urban areas on both sides of the Bulgarian-Turkish border, sold as food and plants for prevention, treatment and healing. Information was collected from open markets by free-listed observations and semi-structured interviews in border regions of Southern and South-eastern Bulgaria (Bg) and North-western <b>Turkey</b> (<b>Tr).</b> The present investigation was carried out through 2011 - 2013. A total of 41 wild plants belonging to 20 families were documented. In this study, two main groups of wild plants were outlined: medicinal and edible, sold mostly as fresh fruits, dry fruits, fresh aerial parts, preserved foods and mono-component herbal teas. The specific use of plants in the border sub-regions can be outlined as follows: as edible greens (Tr), as edible fruits (Bg), as ready-prepared herbal mixtures (Bg), as fresh herbs (Tr). Urtica urens (Tr) is a culturally distinctive plant as well as use of edible greens mixture (Tr) and use of the wild fruits for healthy and traditional food (Tr). Approximately 17 % of the plants were common and widely reported on both sides of the border: such as Urtica dioica, Rumex patientia, Rumex acetosella, Cotinus coggygria, Hypericum perforatum, Sideritis scardica (endemic), Rosa canina and Tilia spp...|$|E

Using a handheld 4100 ExoScan FTIR spectrometer with a diffuse reflectance sample interface, in-situ non-invasive micro-analysis {{was successful in}} three fibre residue and fibre degradation studies: 1. Evaluating the non-ionic detergent Dehypon LS 54 for wet cleaning. Dehypon LS 54 is a new commercial detergent available for textile conservation. DRIFTS {{was used to assess}} its removal from fibres in the cleaning process. Detergent traces in washed but unrinsed fabrics showed characteristic spectral peaks. ATR FTIR could not detect any detergent. 2. Identification of oils characterising historical <b>Turkey</b> red (<b>TR)</b> calico dyeing. DRIFTS revealed traces of oils on calico fabric for historical TR manufactured in mid- 19 th century. Distinctive spectral absorbances for oil bonded to fibres were detected in known TR textiles. These were absent in un-oiled calico and textiles that looked like TR but not made by the process. Thus DRIFTS offers a quick, non-invasive analytical screening tool to identify historical TR textiles. 3. Degradation assessment for historical viscose rayon fibres. Viscose rayon is weak when wet - an issue for textile conservation. Its strength reflects excess hydroxyl groups, amorphous polymeric structure, and low degree of polymerisation, and is affected by manufacturing methods and ageing. DRIFTS enabled historical rayon yarns to be grouped as low, moderate and extensive degradation from spectral information of hydroxyl groups, and peak sizes and shapes...|$|R

At field conditions, effect of several mycorrhizal species inoculation on seedling survive and plant growth along has been studied. Mycorrhizal dependency of several plants and effect of mycorrhiza on plant growth and root infection also has been studied. The field experiments were set up on Arık soil series (Entic Chromoxerert), located in the Agricultural Faculty Research Farm, University of Çukurova, in the Eastern Mediterranean region of Turkey {{to determine the effects}} of several mycorrhizal inoculation on nutrient uptake and yield increases of cucumber, melon, watermelon and pumpkin. Several experiments were performed under filed condition for several years with several plant and mycorrhizae species. Control, Indigenous Mycorrhizae, G. Mosseae, G. Etunicatum, G. Clarum, G. Caledonium and Cocktail mycorrhizae were applied. Mainly seedling quality, seedling survives under filed conditions, and yield response to mycorrhizae was tested. In another experiment with and without P application were used with and without mycorrhizal inoculation. Fruits of plant were collected several times and plant leaves and root samples were taken for nutrient content and mycorrhizal colonization respectively in the blossoming period. After several years under field experiments, mycorrhizal inoculation effectively infected plant root and increased plant yield. So far results revealed that also indigenous mycorrhiza successfully infected plant roots resulting to a better plant growth. The effect of mycorrhizal inoculation on plant growth is changed by effectiveness of inoculum and time. For horticultural seedling quality and surviving it is very important. In all experiments first seedlings were produced for several reasons. In general horticultural fruits plants such as melon, watermelon, cucumber and pumpkin are mycorrhizal dependent plants. Usually plant P and Zn concentration were determined. Mycorrhiza inoculated plant have high P and Zn uptake. After several years’ field experiment, it has been concluded that for horticultural fruits plants significantly response to mycorrhizal species...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental study, {{both in the}} field and laboratory to cast more light on the primary role of the river floodplains in releasing and/or removing total-P to/from the in-stream load, under high runoff and flood conditions, by investigating the soil total-P spatial and vertical deposition patterns and topsoil erodibility, along the three (3) main river sections (e. g., headwaters, transfer and deposition zones) of an agricultural watershed, such as the <b>Turkey</b> River (<b>TR).</b> In soils, phosphorus, P, primarily exists as sediment-bound and less often as dissolved. During wet hydrological years, soil erosion and surface runoff are the main P release and transport mechanisms, while during dry hydrological years, P leaches to the deeper soil levels and is transported to freshwaters through groundwater discharge. In between the upland areas and the river network, there is a buffer zone, known as floodplain that regulates the flux exchanges between these two watershed components. Floodplains play an essential role in the riverine system health by supporting important physical and biochemical processes and improving the water quality downstream. These characteristics have led to the conclusion that floodplains primarily act as sinks for P. However, floodplains are subject to erosion as well, where soil particles along with the attached P are removed from the topsoil or enter re-suspension, under high runoff and flood conditions. The study provides an insight into the soil total-P deposition patterns across the floodplains of five (5) identified field sites and couples them with topsoil erodibility to eventually address the research objectives, which can be summarized as follows: (i) investigation of the soil total-P spatial and vertical variability across the floodplains along the main river zones and development of relationships between P variability and soil physical properties (e. g., soil texture); (ii) identification and characterization of the soil total-P deposition patterns across the floodplains (e. g., short- vs. long-term P deposition areas); and (iii) comparisons of the soil total-P concentrations and critical shear stresses among the main river zones and determination of their primary function either as P sources or sinks, under high runoff and flood conditions. Following that line of thinking, this research results comprise of three (3) parts, each one addressing a specific objective. The first part of the results includes the soil texture and total-P concentration analyses of the extracted soil profiles to identify the soil total-P spatial and vertical deposition patterns across the floodplains, as well as, to investigate the total-P variability with respect to soil physical properties (e. g., soil texture). The second part of the results focuses on investigating the role of topography (e. g., flat vs. ridge vs. swale land surfaces) and flood characteristics (e. g., frequency, magnitude, duration) in soil total-P spatial and vertical deposition patterns across the river floodplains to understand the time-scale nature of the P storage. The last part of the results presents the experimentally determined topsoil critical shear stress values and erodibility rates to characterize the floodplains’ primary function, based on their location along the three (3) main river zones, either as sources or sinks for total-P, during high runoff and flood conditions. Overall, the results of this research show that (i) the total-P concentration in soils is tightly related to the fine particle content and monotonic linear relationships can be established between the two variables. In other words, the higher the fine particle content, the higher the total-P concentration in soils; (ii) a mixture of two normal distributions fit the log-transformed soil total-P concentration data of each field site considered in this study. The fitted distributions successfully capture the two peaks of the soil total-P concentration data correspond to the lower and upper floodplain terraces; (iii) the lower floodplain terraces (e. g., 2 - and 5 -year floodplains) are characterized by significantly lower soil fine particle percentage contributions and total-P concentrations compared to the upper floodplain terraces, at a 5...|$|R
