Another lawyer interviewed by ZDNet, however, did not think that SingNet's actions were improper, and a spokesman for the Infocomm Development Authority announced that SingNet was found to be in compliance with the code. Andy Ho, another The Straits Times editor, expressed concern that private entities might use intellectual property laws invasively, thus precipitating a chilling effect on free speech; he called for privacy laws to be quickly enacted.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's disease, {{particularly}} {{the application of}} the genetic test for the disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring <b>the</b> <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement. In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding its use of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of animal testing and embryonic stem cells.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, 19 October 2011, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs Teo Chee Hean {{explained the}} relevance of the ISA and its powers of preventive detention. He noted that in the 1960s preventive detention was primarily used to counter the subversive Communist threat posed by the Malayan Communist Party which was hiding within legal organizations. For the past two decades, though, preventive detention has helped safeguard Singapore's national security by countering threats posed by espionage and terrorism. Preventive detention allows for a comprehensive assessment of a threat, as opposed to a criminal case tried before a court which requires the court to consider only the specific acts that relate to the charge. Detaining those who have not yet committed overt deeds that warrant prosecution also allows pre-emptive action to be taken to neutralize threats before they materialize into actual harm. In addition, the Minister said that detention without trial is preferable in situations where open prosecutions in court are not practicable due to <b>the</b> <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> certain intelligence. Such intelligence might have been obtained through foreign security agencies on the understanding that the source and details would not be disclosed to an open court. What is more, disclosure of confidential intelligence could compromise ongoing or future operations through the revelation of existing sources and methods of intelligence gathering. However, if confidential information were withheld from the court, a criminal case could be weakened due to evidential requirements, which may result in the acquittal of an otherwise guilty accused. Finally, court proceedings may stall investigations {{as part of a broader}} network, and could exacerbate situations where communal sensitivities are involved.|$|E

40|$|The thesis "Limitations of {{professional}} liability {{in relation to}} the professions of auditor, tax adviser and accountant with regard to the duty of confidentiality" focuses on a more detailed elaboration of the selected specific segment {{of professional}} liability of the given professions, on the legal and ethical obligations in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> and <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> its breaking. The introductory part of the thesis deals with <b>confidentiality</b> in terms <b>of</b> historical development and its importance in the present. Further, it outlines the area of moral and ethical responsibility, legal liability in general, and confidentiality as a specific duty. <b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> professions of auditors, tax advisers and accountants represents the core of the presented work. <b>The</b> duty <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> profession of auditors is significantly influenced by the public interest in the presented information in the form of opinion on the financial statements of the audited entities, and thus the possibilities of the legally supported breaking of this obligation are the most extensive, as evidenced by the amendment to the Act on Auditors, effective from 1 October 2016. <b>The</b> duty <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax adviser has until recently been strictly defined on a legal basis. The change was brought by the Supreme Court's case law in November 2015, which by comparing the principally equivalent conditions for the exercise of legal liability in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax adviser and attorney, also deduces the similarities of competencies of both professions in cases <b>of</b> breaking <b>the</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> <b>The</b> accounting profession is not regulated by law, and therefore <b>the</b> <b>confidentiality</b> obligation is also not legally enforceable. However, professional certified accountants are required to comply with the Code of Conduct issued by the Professional Chamber. The final part of the thesis focuses on comparing <b>the</b> duty <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> selected professions of auditors, tax advisers and professional accountants with the attorney-at-law profession...|$|R

25|$|O'Connor {{rejected}} the FBI's argument that confidentiality can be presumed {{based on the}} fact that an informant is giving information to the FBI. Justice O'Connor also rejected most forms of categorical presumptions of confidentiality that the FBI often used, such as automatic confidentiality for the purposes of Exemption 7(D) for all documents that are collected for a criminal investigation (which is one of the categorical presumptions the FBI used in this specific case). Justice O'Connor sarcastically stated that, under the way the FBI declared <b>the</b> <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> documents, the FBI would expect that every single one of its documents can be withheld or redacted and that it can use Exemption 7(D) for all of its documents.|$|E

While bishops hold the secrecy pertained only internally, and did not preclude investigation by civil law enforcement, the letter was often seen as promoting a coverup. Later, as pope, he was accused in a lawsuit of conspiring to cover up the molestation of three boys in Texas, but sought and obtained diplomatic immunity from liability.|$|E

Julius Caesar is credited with the invention of the Caesar cipher c. 50 B.C., which was created in order to prevent his secret messages from being read should a message fall into the wrong hands, {{but for the most part}} protection was achieved through the application of procedural handling controls. Sensitive information was marked up to indicate that it should be protected and transported by trusted persons, guarded and stored in a secure environment or strong box. As postal services expanded, governments created official organizations to intercept, decipher, read and reseal letters (e.g. the UK Secret Office and Deciphering Branch in 1653).|$|E

25|$|O'Connor did, however, {{state that}} the Court accepts certain forms of {{categorical}} presumptions of confidentiality.

She stated that a paid informant can expect that his/her cooperation with the FBI will be kept secret, and that this makes documents related to a paid informant subject to being withheld or redacted in accordance with Exemption 7(D). She also stated that, in murder cases like this one, informants may also expect to have their interactions with the FBI be confidential. Justice O'Connor said that the Court would accept the FBI's presumption of <b>the</b> <b>confidentiality</b> <b>of</b> any documents related to an informant for a murder case.|$|E
