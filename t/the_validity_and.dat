25|$|<b>The</b> <b>validity</b> <b>and</b> {{importance}} of c-command for {{the theory of}} syntax is a debated issue. In most cases, c-command correlates positively with precedence (linear order), that is, when node A c-commands node B, {{it is usually the}} case that node A also precedes node B. Furthermore, basic S(V)O (subject-verb-object) word order in English correlates positively with a hierarchy of syntactic functions, subjects outranking objects. Subjects typically precede objects in declarative sentences in English and related languages. These two insights suggest that theories of syntax that build on c-command have misconstrued the {{importance of}} precedence and/or the hierarchy of syntactic functions. What c-command is intended to address is arguably more accurately analyzed in terms of precedence and the syntactic functions. Further, the c-command concept was developed primarily with its ability to address syntactic phenomena of English, a language with relatively strict word order. When confronted with the much freer word order of many other languages, the insights provided by c-command are less compelling, since linear order becomes less important.|$|E
