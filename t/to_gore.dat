25|$|Gore easily {{defeated}} Bradley in the primaries, {{largely because}} {{of support from the}} Democratic Party establishment and Bradley's poor showing in the Iowa caucus, where Gore successfully painted Bradley as aloof and indifferent to the plight of farmers. The closest Bradley came to a victory was his 50–46 loss <b>to</b> <b>Gore</b> in the New Hampshire primary. On March 14, Al Gore clinched the Democratic nomination.|$|E

The decision was not unanimous and several participants, including the nobleman Blatta Tekle Wolde Hawariat, strenuously objected to the idea of an Ethiopian monarch fleeing before an invading force. Haile Selassie appointed his cousin Ras Imru Haile Selassie as Prince Regent in his absence, departing with his family for French Somaliland on 2 May 1936.|$|E

The route's western terminus was moved to SH-2 at Welch on April 14, 1941. However, the other terminus was moved north at the end of that year, resulting in SH-10 being truncated <b>to</b> <b>Gore</b> after November 12, 1941.

25|$|Forgetting the raw gas {{burns on}} his own arm, Haile Selassie retired into his Palace for a final conference with his chieftains. It was clear {{to him that the}} Government of the Ethiopian Empire would have to move from Addis Ababa. One {{possibility}} was for the government to relocate <b>to</b> <b>Gore</b> in the southwest and he sought comment on this plan. Initially his bearded chiefs said nothing at all. But, when the chiefs did talk, they explained that the one effective Ethiopian army left was fighting for its life under Ras Nasibu Emmanual in the Ogaden. This army was pitted against General Rodolfo Graziani's relentless advance on Harar. They added that the tribes to the west were in an ugly mood. One after another, the chiefs rose to tell how hopeless the situation was and to say that there was nothing for the Emperor to do but run for his life.|$|E

25|$|Boars of {{all ages}} were once the primary prey of tigers in Transcaucasia, Kazakhstan, Middle Asia and the Far East up until the late 19th century. In modern times, tiger numbers are too low to have a {{limiting}} effect on boar populations. A single tiger can systematically destroy an entire sounder by preying on its members one by one, {{before moving on to}} another herd. Tigers have been noted to chase boars for longer distances than with other prey. In two rare cases, boars were reported <b>to</b> <b>gore</b> a small tiger and a tigress to death in self-defense. In the Amur region, wild boars are one of the two most important prey species for tigers alongside the Manchurian wapiti, with the two species collectively comprising roughly 80% of the felid's prey. In Sikhote Alin, a tiger can kill 30–34 boars a year. Studies of tigers in India indicate that boars are usually secondary in preference to various cervids and bovids, though when boars are targeted, healthy adults are caught more frequently than young and sick specimens.|$|E

Bradley campaigned as {{the liberal}} alternative <b>to</b> <b>Gore,</b> taking positions {{to the left of}} Gore on a number of issues, including universal health care, gun control, and campaign finance reform. On the issue of taxes, Bradley trumpeted his sponsorship of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which had significantly cut tax rates while abolishing dozens of loopholes. He voiced his belief that the best possible tax code would be one with low rates and no loopholes, but he refused to rule out the idea of raising taxes to pay for his health care program, calling the idea of such a pledge [...] "dishonest".|$|E

500|$|Lew Wallace's 1880 novel, , ran {{to about}} 550 pages. Zimbalist hired {{a number of}} screenwriters to cut the story down and turn the novel into a script. According <b>to</b> <b>Gore</b> Vidal, more than 12 {{versions}} of the script had been written by various writers {{by the spring of}} 1958. Vidal himself had been asked to write a version of the script in 1957, refused, and been placed on suspension for his decision. According to Vidal, Karl Tunberg {{was one of the last}} writers to work on the script. Other sources place Tunberg's initial involvement much earlier. Tunberg cut out everything in the book after the crucifixion of Jesus, omitted the sub-plot in which Ben-Hur fakes his death and raises a Jewish army to overthrow the Romans, and altered the manner in which the leperous women are healed. According to Wyler, Vidal, their biographers (see bibliography below) and the sources that follow them, Zimbalist was unhappy with Tunberg's script, considering it to be [...] "pedestrian" [...] and [...] "unshootable".|$|E
500|$|Gore {{faced an}} early {{challenge}} by former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley. Bradley {{was the only}} candidate to oppose Gore and was considered a [...] "fresh face" [...] for the White House. Gore challenged Bradley {{to a series of}} debates which took the form of [...] "town hall" [...] meetings. Gore went on the offensive during these debates leading to a drop in the polls for Bradley. In the Iowa caucus the unions pledged their support <b>to</b> <b>Gore,</b> despite Bradley spending heavily in that state, and Bradley was much embarrassed by his two to one defeat there. Gore went on to capture the New Hampshire primary 53-47%, which had been a must-win state for Bradley. Gore then swept all of the primaries on Super Tuesday while Bradley finished a distant second in each state. On March 9, 2000, after failing to win any of the first 20 primaries and caucuses in the election process, Bradley withdrew his campaign and endorsed Gore. Gore eventually went on to win every primary and caucus and, in March 2000 even won the first primary election ever held over the Internet, the Arizona Presidential Primary. By then, he secured the Democratic nomination.|$|E
500|$|After the 1992 presidential election, Browner {{served as}} {{transition}} director for Vice President-elect Gore. [...] President-elect Bill Clinton announced her as his choice for Environmental Protection Agency head on December 11, 1992. [...] While both Clinton and Gore had criticized the George H. W. Bush administration's commitment to environmental protection during the campaign, {{the selection of}} Browner – who was described by The Washington Post as having [...] "the mind and training of an attorney-legislator but the soul of an activist" [...] – {{was seen as an}} indication that Gore's ardent environmentalism had won out over Clinton's more pro-business mindset. [...] Clinton later wrote that he had not known her, but that Chiles had recommended her highly and Gore had requested she be named. [...] The pick, along with several others of Gore protégés that Clinton made, helped solidify the vice president's position within the administration. [...] At her confirmation hearings before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied <b>to</b> <b>Gore.</b> [...] She was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the United States Senate on January 21, 1993.|$|E

500|$|The Florida recount {{was stopped}} {{a few weeks}} later by the U.S. Supreme Court. In the ruling, Bush v. Gore, the Justices held that the Florida recount was unconstitutional and that no constitutionally valid recount could be {{completed}} by the December 12 deadline, effectively ending the recounts. This 7–2 vote ruled that the standards the Florida Supreme Court provided for a recount were unconstitutional due to violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and further ruled 5–4 that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by the December 12 deadline. This case ordered an end to recounting underway in selected Florida counties, effectively giving George W. Bush a 537 vote victory in Florida and consequently Florida's 25 electoral votes and the presidency. The results of the decision led <b>to</b> <b>Gore</b> winning the popular vote by approximately 500,000 votes nationwide, but receiving 266 electoral votes to Bush's 271 (one District of Columbia elector abstained). On December 13, 2000, Gore conceded the election.
