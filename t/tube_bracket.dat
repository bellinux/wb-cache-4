40|$|Blood {{contamination}} of 16 surfaces in the dental surgery was investigated using the Kastle-Meyer test for haemoglobin, after {{three types of}} periodontal procedures had been performed on a total of 30 patients. The effect of cleaning surfaces contaminated by blood was investigated using the same test. Cleaning materials used in the dental surgery were tested {{to rule out the}} possibility of false positive outcomes and the sensitivity of the test was determined prior to the study. The results show a marked variation in the degree of contamination and efficacy of cleaning following treatment. Overall, root planing was associated with the most widespread and frequent blood contamination and gingival surgery the least. The surgery work surface, edge of the spittoon, aspirator tube and ultrasonic scaler handpiece into which the ultrasonic insert fits, were the most frequently contaminated surfaces. The work surface, dentist’s pen, light switch and handle were cleaned most effectively. The least effectively cleaned surfaces were the water dispenser switch, aspirator <b>tube,</b> <b>bracket</b> table and ultrasonic scaler handpiece. Methods for reducing this potential source of cross-infection are discussed...|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} model XA remains popular on {{the used}} aircraft market and aircraft for sale command high prices. Long operational {{use and the}} rigours of land and water operation have resulted in weak points in the design being identified as many older aircraft have suffered from bent wing trailing edges, wing root <b>tube</b> <b>brackets,</b> flying wire shackles and tail boom tubes. Cracked aft vertical stabilizer tubes and main bulkheads are also common. All of these deficiencies can be repaired in used aircraft.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Ion mobility-mass {{spectrometry}} measurements which {{describe the}} gas-phase scaling of molecular size and mass are of both fundamental and pragmatic utility. Fundamentally, such measurements expand {{our understanding of}} intrinsic intramolecular folding forces {{in the absence of}} solvent. Practically, reproducible transport properties, such as gas-phase collision cross-section (CCS), are analytically useful metrics for identification and characterization purposes. Here, we report 594 CCS values obtained in nitrogen drift gas on an electrostatic drift tube ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) instrument. The instrument platform is a newly developed prototype incorporating a uniform-field drift <b>tube</b> <b>bracketed</b> by electrodynamic ion funnels and coupled to a high resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The CCS values reported here are of high experimental precision (± 0. 5 % or better) and represent four chemically distinct classes of molecules (quaternary ammonium salts, lipids, peptides, and carbohydrates), which enables structural comparisons to be made between molecules of different chemical compositions for the rapid “omni-omic ” characterization of complex biological samples...|$|R

50|$|Davenport and Petter {{designed}} {{an aircraft}} to incorporate these features with unconventional results. The Lysander was {{powered by a}} Bristol Mercury air-cooled radial engine and had high wings and a fixed conventional landing gear faired inside large, streamlined spats. The spats had mountings for small, removable stub wings {{that could be used}} to carry light bombs or supply canisters. The wings had a reverse taper towards the root, which gave the impression of a bent gull wing from some angles, although the spars were straight. It had a girder type construction faired with a light wood stringers to give the aerodynamic shape. The forward fuselage was duralumin <b>tube</b> joined with <b>brackets</b> and plates, and the after part was welded stainless steel <b>tubes.</b> Plates and <b>brackets</b> were cut from channel extrusions rather than forming from sheet steel. The front spar and lift struts were extrusions. The wing itself was fabric covered, and with its thickness maximized at the lift strut anchorage location, similar to that of later marks of the Stinson Reliant high-winged transport monoplane.|$|R
30|$|Either a JV or a NPV is used {{to produce}} the {{molecular}} beam. Both valves are mounted in a cylindrical tube, which is inserted in a cylindrical donut-shaped bracket that is suspended inside the source chamber. This bracket is aligned {{with respect to the}} skimmer and axis of the Stark decelerator, and ensures that valves are positioned correctly and reproducibly. The distance between valve orifice and skimmer can be varied between 2 cm and 20 cm, and is adjusted by simply moving the <b>tube</b> inside the <b>bracket.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} aimed {{to assess the}} value of {{endoscopic}} jejunostomy for post-biliary intestinal anastomosis biliary complications. The clinical data of the endoscopic therapies by jejunal approach for post-biliary intestinal anas-tomosis biliary complications in 13 patients (16 surgeries in total) were retrospectively analyzed. The surgical success rate was 100 % (16 / 16). Nasobiliary tube detention was performed for 2 patients, plastic stent placement for 5 and biliary metal stent placement for 4. The remaining two patients did not retain any drainage <b>tube</b> or <b>bracket</b> after surgery. The incidence rate of intraoperative anastomotic stenostomia was 76. 9 % (10 / 13). A noticeable postoperative decrease in bilirubin levels was observed in 10 patients. The level of gallstone-free patients was 75 % (3 / 4). There were 10 cases in which cholangitis remission or no attack was identified. Post-operative incisional infection occurred in 3 patients, hepatophyma in 1 and an intestinal fistula in 1. Endoscopic therapy by jejunal approach for post-biliary intestinal anastomosis biliary complications has the virtue of being safe, effective and minimally invasive. It has extensive potential applications in clinical practice...|$|R

This is another reason for generally keeping the cantilevers long. In those cases where the cantilevers, for different reasons are short, the load/deflection rate can be lowered by the addition of one or more loops, or by using a smaller wire dimension. The latter does, however, also cause a problem, as the play between wire and <b>bracket</b> (<b>tube)</b> may become unacceptable. In this case, a composite cantilever could be advisable.A third and better solution is to choose a wire alloy with a lower stiffness. For this reason and for its high formability, cantilevers are usually made out of beta-titanium.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn recent years, the {{automotive}} industry is {{making an effort to}} reduce the vehicle weight for reducing the CO 2 emissions. The hot stamping of high strength steels offers the possibility to obtain significant reduction of weight. The conventional door impact structure design is composed of one or two <b>tubes</b> and two <b>brackets</b> by stamping. There are many advantages if conventional design was changed to hot stamping design such as cost saving, tools amount and weight reduction. The development of door impact beam by hot stamping is illustrated in this paper. It includes the product design, process evaluation, die design, CAE simulation, and prototype manufacturing. Finally it uses hardness test, thinning rate analysis, and quasi-static three-point bending test to check the hot stamping parts performance, including mechanical properties, plastic deformation capacity and absorbing energy ability. It could be a reference for automotive industry to develop the similar products...|$|R
3000|$|The 20 non-extraction class I {{patients}} were randomly {{divided into two}} experimental groups: 10 patients (8 females, 2 males; mean age 19.3 ± 3.6) wore Roth labial metal brackets (American Orthodontics, Sheboygan, WI, USA) and the other 10 (7 females, 3 males; mean age 22.3 ± 3.2) wore STb lingual brackets (Ormco Corporation, Glendora, CA, USA), both with a 0.018 -in × 0.025 -in slot system. After enamel etching, upper and lower first molar <b>tubes</b> and <b>brackets</b> were bonded in both groups with Maximum Cure (Reliance Orthodontic Products, Itasca, IL, USA). The ligature system was based on preformed 0.010 -in stainless steel ligatures. After {{the approval of the}} local ethical committee and the written informed consent of the patients, clinical and microbiological evaluations were collected at three time points: before the placement of the orthodontic appliance (T 0), 4 weeks after bonding (T 1), and 8 weeks after bonding (T 2). After the placement of the appliances, all of the {{patients were}} periodically educated to brush their teeth three times a day, according to the modified Bass technique [35], using a manual toothbrush (Oral B, Procter & Gamble, Cincinnati, OH, USA) and fluoride toothpaste only.

40|$|Abstract] Objectives: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of adhesive application on the shear bond strength (SBS) of orthodontic <b>brackets</b> and <b>tubes</b> to acid-etched human enamel when using different cementing agents. Study Design: One hundred and sixty metal attachments (80 <b>tubes</b> and 80 <b>brackets)</b> were bonded to human third molars and premolars that were randomly divided into identical groups of four: Transbond XT (XT); Wave MV Flow (WF); APC Plus System (APC); and Fuji Ortho LC (LC). For each experimental group, half of the specimens were bonded in combination with Transbond XT adhesive. After 72 [*]h, a SBS test was performed using a universal testing machine. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc comparisons, χ 2 tests, and linear regression modeling. Adhesive remnant index scores were determined for the teeth after failure. Representative tooth surfaces from each subgroup were assessed under SEM. Results: Considering that each cement was observed, each of them showed similar SBS when the adhesive system was applied as when the adhesive was not applied. By comparing all cements together, it was noted that if an adhesive is not applied, all cements have similar values. If an adhesive is applied, cement XT, WF, and APC showed significantly higher SBS values than LC did. The tubes showed higher SBS than the brackets did in cements XT and WF with or without an adhesive, as well as APC Plus with an adhesive. Conclusions: The use of an adhesive system in bonding <b>brackets</b> and <b>tubes</b> does not influence the SBS obtained, independently of the cement...|$|R
