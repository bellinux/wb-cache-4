The results of the surveys concur with the secondary research of on-campus catering in the UK. The findings of this research have implications for a number of stakeholders; however, the greatest impact will be on the providers of catering provision on-campus in order to meet the needs of respondents.

Following an extensive literature review on budgeting within Corporations and <b>Third</b> <b>Level</b> <b>Educational</b> <b>Institutions</b> a mail survey questionnaire on the subject of budgeting and ERP control systems was sent to a selection of universities and <b>third</b> <b>level</b> institutions in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. The comparisons between budgeting within corporations and the <b>third</b> <b>level</b> <b>educational</b> sector are examined as well as the changing attitudes towards the 'traditional' budgeting methodologies. The emerging role ERP and information technology is having on budgeting processes is also investigated. Responses from the mail questionnaire were analysed to determine the budgeting and control methods adapted within <b>third</b> <b>level</b> <b>educational</b> <b>institutions</b> in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom and to investigate the role of ERP and information technology on budgeting within the sector. The results of the emerging role ERP and information technology is having on budgeting processes is also investigated. Responses from the mail questionnaire were analysed to determine the budgeting and control methods adapted within <b>third</b> <b>level</b> <b>educational</b> <b>institutions</b> in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom and to investigate the role of ERP and information technology on budgeting within the sector. The results of the survey highlight the emerging attitudes and changing role information technology and ERP is having on <b>third</b> <b>level</b> institutions. The research concludes that while some <b>third</b> <b>level</b> institutions have adapted ERP systems, many are {{still in the process of}} change. Despite the demand from heads of departments for 'on-line' access to 'real-time', 'accurate' budgetary information many <b>third</b> <b>level</b> institutions are still reporting 'historical financial information' to budget holders. Further research is required in relation to <b>third</b> <b>level</b> institutions who are reporting 'on-line' budgetary information to budget holders in order to establish the extent of improvements in budgetary control as a result of implementing ERP. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} characteristic {{for an individual}} to actively participate in a society is to be literate (Martin, 2008). Consequently, digital literacy is an essential quality in our era. The European Commission (2013 b) reported that by 2030 90 % of jobs will require digital skills. In September 2013 the European Commission announced the launch of ‘Open Up Education’ initiative (European Commission, 2013 b) to improve the digital literacy in Europe through Open Educational Resources (OER). The overall aim of this change project was to introduce video-based educational resources in not-for-profit, <b>third</b> <b>level</b> <b>educational</b> <b>institution.</b> Literature review was conducted to identify the benefits and challenges of OER and the methods and mediums of delivering OER. Senior and Swailes’ change model was used as framework for the change. Different environmental tools were used to diagnose the situation and change champions were approached to do a pilot video to gain commitments for the vision. Gantt chart was used when developing an action plan to implement the change. Mixed methods approaches of qualitative and quantitative analysis {{were used to assess}} and evaluate the change by using Jacob’s change model. Overall the change agent is confident that the overall aim and objectives for the project has been achieved successfully with the biggest organisational impact {{is the fact that the}} college now has official contribution to the international OER movement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} is to reach an {{understanding}} of the reality of the work undertaken by the disability officer in relation to student support in a third level education institution in Ireland. To achieve the purpose the objectives set out were: to examine the ‘everyday’ work of a disability officer, describe the ‘visible’ and ‘invisible’ processes of the everyday, include the student voice and the disability officer voice and use a reflective practice approach to serve as a method of inquiry that allows for a way of finding out about self as well as the research topic. Use of accessible language in the ethnography was a priority. The choice of reflexive ethnography as methodology was primarily influenced by the ethical requirement that no burden of time or energy be placed on the cohort under study – students with disabilities. The reflexive element in the ethnography allows that the ‘turning back on oneself’ is the means by which the author is visible throughout the ethnography. In this study the ‘field’ (an ethnographic term for the study setting) is a <b>third</b> <b>level</b> <b>educational</b> <b>institution.</b> The ‘fieldnotes’ are a written account of what happened in the field during the time of the collection of data. Through working with fieldnotes created by students and input on behalf of students by the ethnographer, the student voice is heard. From these fieldnotes an extracted statement made by a student during the data collection phase of the study is the focus of the analysis. Agar’s (1985) protocol is used in undertaking the analysis. Interpretation of the analysis is underpinned by the use of Goleman’s work (1996, 1999, and 2006) in the area of emotional intelligence. Findings of the study are; that listening can be understood as caring and that in the unique setting of the research there is a student need to perceive the disability officer role as a caring role. The role of the disability officer is considered to have emerged only recently. It has not been the subject of much discussion in the literature to date. The issue of whether the disability officer role is a professional one is examined, resulting in the acceptance that for now it is most likely a semi-professional role. The required undertakings to professionalise the role are currently being addressed by disability officers in Ireland. The substantive issue and contribution of the research is the uncovering of an affective element to the disability officer’s everyday work and the acknowledgement that it is, for the main part, invisible work. The affective element centres on active listening and through such listening the disability officer’s role as a caring one has been demonstrated...|$|E
