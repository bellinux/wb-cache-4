500|$|The {{title of}} Gather Together is {{inspired}} by Matthew 18:19-20: [...] "Again I say unto you, That if <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I {{in the midst of}} them" [...] (King James version). While Angelou acknowledged the title's biblical origin, she also stated that the title counteracted the tendency of many adults to lie to their children about their pasts. Scholar Sondra O'Neale states that the title is [...] "a New Testament injunction for the traveling soul to pray and commune while waiting patiently for deliverance".|$|E
500|$|Davuluri, {{the first}} Indian American {{to win the}} Miss America pageant (and the second Miss New York in a row), held the title of Miss America 2014 from September 15, 2013 to September 14, 2014. In doing so, she {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} a previous Miss Syracuse/Miss New York, Vanessa Williams, who (as Miss America 1984) was the first African American winner of the pageant. She is also the second Asian American contestant to be crowned Miss America (the first was Filipino American Angela Perez Baraquio in 2001). NPR's Michael Martin commented on this aspect of her win by noting that “there were five Asian-Americans competing for the crown. That's the highest number in pageant history. Three of you were in the top five. <b>Two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> were the finalists, and this in a contest where initially the requirements were that contestants be of good health and of the white race." ...|$|E

500|$|In later years, Fellini {{explained}} that from [...] "a sentimental point of view," [...] he was [...] "most attached" [...] to La Strada: [...] "Above all, because I {{feel that it}} is my most representative film, the one that is the most autobiographical; for both personal and sentimental reasons, because it is the film that I had the greatest trouble in realizing and that gave me the most difficulty {{when it came time to}} find a producer." [...] Of all the imaginary beings he had brought to the screen, Fellini felt closest to the three principals of La Strada, [...] "especially Zampanò." [...] Anthony Quinn found working for Fellini invaluable: [...] "He drove me mercilessly, making me do scene after scene over and over again until he got what he wanted. I learned more about film acting in three months with Fellini than I'd learned in all the movies I'd made before then." [...] Long afterwards, in 1990, Quinn sent a note to the director and his co-star: [...] "The <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> are the highest point in my life -- Antonio." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, {{he played}} Mark Thatcher in Coup!, a dramatisation of the {{attempted}} coup in Equatorial Guinea. He also starred as Adrien opposite Nicholas Tennant in the UK premiére of Members Only at the Trafalgar Studios. He accepted the {{part because it}} was [...] "funny, plausible, plausibly absurd and cruel" [...] and he liked {{that it was a}} translation from an original French play. He enjoyed working on it, telling What's on Stage: [...] "Nick is a really good actor and really good to work with in that you can have completely frank discussions about tiny issues and it's totally ego-free. We're all just discussing the point and not playing games with each other. It does make the working practice easier. If there's only <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> in a play, you are equally responsible – there's nobody else to blame if it goes wrong. So its a greater risk and there's no hiding". At the end of the year, he appeared opposite Richard Wilson in Whipping it Up, a play about whips in a fictional David Cameron government. To research his role, he watched more Commons debates.|$|E
500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media. Meyers explained, [...] "In the other video we were shooting, {{she came out of}} the trailer wearing a So So Def jacket, and that's when I got the idea, 'it would be great if you do a whole video if you look like you do now when you're going home'. It took her a minute, she thought about it, she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get the <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> in a simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Reese and Wernick were on set every day, which Reynolds {{personally}} {{paid for}} after Fox was unwilling to. The writers had scripted the action very specifically, [...] "every kill and almost down to every punch, kick, or shot", but Tim Miller and the stunt coordinators {{were free to}} change this. Robert Alonzo and Philip J. Silvera were the stunt coordinators for the film; Silvera had provided motion capture reference for the test footage. The stunt team had a month before filming began to prepare the actors, with Skrein working [...] "nonstop" [...] to prepare. Silvera said Reynolds [...] "has a photographic memory; he'd do something {{three or four times}} and remember it very well." [...] A lot of the jokes in the film were improvised on set, particularly by Reynolds. He said that the actors often came up with around 15 alternate jokes for each one written in the script, and were generally only limited to those because of time constraints. Reese said, for example, Wernick had written some jokes for the scene where Deadpool visits Colossus and Negasonic, but on set Reynolds improvised the line [...] "You know it’s funny how I only see the <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> here. It’s like the studio couldn’t afford any more X-Men." [...] This was based in truth, and became then Fox chairman Jim Gianopulos’ favorite line.|$|E

2500|$|After the Battle of Jiangling in 209, Cao Cao left Li Dian, Zhang Liao and Yue Jin {{to defend}} Hefei, a {{strategic}} location {{at the border}} between Cao Cao and Sun Quan's territories. Around 214, when Sun Quan led his forces to attack Hefei, Zhang Liao wanted to lead their troops {{out of the city}} to resist the enemy. However, Zhang Liao was aware that the three of them could not get along with each other and he was worried that they would not comply with his orders. Zhang Liao said, [...] "Our lord is away at war. By the time his reinforcements reach here, we're already done for. So he's actually instructing us {{to take advantage of the}} situation, when the enemy has just arrived and not fully gathered yet, to attack them and devastate their morale so as to calm our men and strengthen our defences. Victory or defeat, it all depends on this battle. Why are the <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> still hesitating?" [...] Li Dian was moved and he said, [...] "This is a national crisis. We'll see how your strategy works out. How can I allow my personal issues take precedence over my official duties?" [...] Zhang Liao, Li Dian and Yue Jin then worked together and succeeded in defeating and driving away Sun Quan's much larger army. Li Dian was rewarded with an additional 100 taxable households in his marquisate, bringing the total number of households to 300.|$|E
2500|$|When Cao Cao retreated {{after being}} {{defeated}} by Sun Quan and Liu Bei at the Battle of Red Cliffs {{in the winter}} of 208–209, he left behind Zhang Liao, Yue Jin and Li Dian with about 7,000 soldiers to guard Hefei (合肥; present-day Hefei, Anhui) from possible attacks by Sun Quan. In around 214, before Cao Cao went on a campaign against the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery, he instructed Xue Ti (薛悌) to pass a sealed letter to the three generals at Hefei. He wrote, [...] "Open when the enemy comes" [...] on the envelope. Later that year, Sun Quan led about 100,000 troops to attack Hefei, so they opened the letter. It read, [...] "If Sun Quan comes, Generals Zhang and Li will go out to fight the enemy while General Yue will defend the fortress. Xue Ti will stay out of the battle." [...] They were confused after reading the letter. Zhang Liao told Yue Jin and Li Dian, [...] "Our lord is away on a campaign. By the time his reinforcements reach here, we're already done for. So he's actually instructing us {{to take advantage of the}} situation – when the enemy has just arrived and isn't fully gathered yet – to attack them and devastate their morale so we can calm our men and strengthen our defences. Victory or defeat, it all depends on this battle. Why are the <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> still hesitating?" [...] The three generals then worked together and recruited over 800 elite soldiers that night and prepared for battle the following day.|$|E

2500|$|Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr and Abdullah ibn Umar were mid level Muslim commanders at the Battle of Yarmouk {{that took}} Syria. Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr sister Asmā' bint Abu Bakr also {{fought in the}} Battle of Yarmouk and was opposed to Yazid. Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr {{had been one of}} the first to duel in that battle, after taking a sword to hand over to a Qays bin Hubayrah who had lost his sword, while in a duel with the Roman Army's best horseman. Two more Roman {{horsemen}} then came forward, saying, [...] "We see no justice when <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> come against one of us." [...] Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr replied, [...] "I only came to give my companion a sword and then return. Were 100 of you to come out against one of us we would not be worried. You are now three men. I am enough to take on all three of you". After which he took down the Roman horsemen on his own. After seeing this, Bannes the Roman general said [...] "Caesar really knew these people best. I now know that a difficult situation is to come on you. If you do not attack them with great numbers, you will have no chance". Abdullah ibn Umar had also been a mid level commander in the Battle of Yarmouk. Some Roman soldiers went to the house of Abu al-Jaid a local Christian in az-Zura ah and after eating all the food, raped his wife and killed his son. His wife complained to the Roman general and he ignored her. Abu al-Jaid then went to the Muslims and told them that he knows the local area and if the Muslims exempt him and his descendents from taxes for ever he will help them defeat the Roman army. He then took horse men led by Abdullah ibn Umar to the Roman camp at night and attacked them and then ran away. The Romans chased them and in the dark tens of thousands of them fell down a cliff at the an-Naqusah Creek into a river. Abdullah bin Az-Zubair had also been a commander in various battles including in North Africa and was also involved in the siege of Constantinople.|$|E
