In 2003, Usher started working on the album which would become Confessions, which contained songs inspired by the personal lives of Usher and his collaborators. The songs about infidelity and pregnant mistresses were inspired not by Usher's private life, but by Jermaine Dupri's own personal challenges at the time. Dupri deliberately intended to create an air of mystery about Usher, and arouse fans' curiosity about {{how much of the}} infidelity story was Usher's own confession. The unintended result of this was to arouse Thomas's suspicions about Usher. <b>They</b> <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> in December 2003.|$|E

They said that he did not brag about it, and in fact seemed to regret his decision. Cristina denied this ever happened. Later that year they attended St. Joe's prom together.

5|$|From about 1997, as dissatisfaction grew {{with the}} concept of Cool Britannia and Britpop as a {{movement}} began to dissolve, emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it. Bands that had enjoyed some success during the mid-1990s, but were not really part of the Britpop scene, included The Verve and Radiohead. After the decline of Britpop they began to gain more critical and popular attention. The Verve's album Urban Hymns (1997) was a worldwide hit and their commercial peak before <b>they</b> <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> in 1999, while Radiohead - although having achieved moderate recognition with The Bends in 1995 - achieved near-universal critical acclaim with their experimental third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001).|$|E

Steph told Max that he and Tom were now her family, a family further bonded when he proposed marriage. Steph becomes friends with Niall, who fell for her, although she saw him more as someone to confide her problems in.

She'd spilled something on her dress, but he assumed the worst and <b>they</b> <b>broke</b> <b>up.</b> A few days later {{she went back to}} Niall's place and they kissed, but were interrupted by his room-mate.|$|E
5|$|After 15:00 an airstrike {{was called}} in to {{dislodge}} the surviving Chinese in front of D Company. However, the attack by two US Marine Corps F4U Corsairs was mistakenly directed at the Australians themselves after their positions were wrongly marked by the spotter plane. Two men were killed and several badly burnt by napalm before the attack was broken off after the company second-in-command—Captain Michael Ryan—ran out under Chinese fire waving a marker panel. The company medical orderly—Private Ronald Dunque—was subsequently awarded the Military Medal for his efforts assisting the wounded despite his own injuries. The Chinese quickly attempted to exploit the chaos, moving against D Company's long exposed eastern flank. 11 Platoon on the main ridge forward of the summit was subjected to a frontal assault; however, unaffected by the napalm, <b>they</b> <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> the Chinese attack and inflicted heavy casualties on them. Regardless, further Chinese attempts to infiltrate the Australian positions continued into the afternoon.|$|E

5|$|Chambers and {{his second}} in command, Captain Charles Spragg, {{immediately}} set about constructing a defensive trench across the post, and strengthening its other defences. But by now the Turks, from the 72nd Infantry Regiment, about 1,000-strong, had managed to use the terrain and darkness to close in on the position. At 22:00 Chambers reported that the position was under attack and surrounded, and at 23:35 the telephone line to headquarters was cut by the Turks. The area in front of No.3 Post was in a gully {{and out of sight}} to the defenders, so they had to climb on the trench parapet to engage the Turks. This tactic worked well, and <b>they</b> <b>broke</b> <b>up</b> the Turkish assault, causing the attackers some casualties. The Turks did not withdraw far, and crept up {{to the edge of the}} New Zealanders' trench during the night. They then threw hand grenades into the New Zealanders' position. At the same time, small arms fire from the surrounding Turkish positions pinned the New Zealanders down.|$|E
