30|$|For <b>the</b> {{historical}} gas <b>production</b> data, {{similar to}} that of <b>the</b> oil <b>production</b> data, there are no separate statistics for non-conventional gas from China’s authorities (Wang et al. 2016 c).

5|$|Any {{point that}} lies either on <b>the</b> <b>production</b> {{possibilities}} curve {{or to the}} left of it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie to the right of <b>the</b> <b>production</b> possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly {{to the left of}} the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing <b>the</b> <b>production</b> of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on <b>the</b> <b>production</b> possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E
