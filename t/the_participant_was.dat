25|$|The last segment {{featured}} {{a party in}} the participants' hometown, where she would show off her new look to friends and family, who would comment on how impressed they were and how happy she looked. With the credits rolling, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> shown in additional wardrobe items and commented on what the experience did for her emotionally and how it improved her confidence.|$|E
25|$|In {{studies of}} {{prepared}} learning, conditioned fear responses to images of outgroup males {{were far more}} difficult to extinguish than conditioned fear responses to outgroup females or ingroup members of either sex, as measured by conductivity tests of perspiration on the skin. These results held true whether <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> male or female. Because the neural circuitry for fear responses are more developed towards stimuli that have posed a larger threat for most of human history (snakes and spiders, for example, which were dangers frequently encountered by foragers), {{these findings suggest that}} outgroup males may have been more of a threat to physical safety than outgroup women or ingroup members, supporting the male warrior hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Another {{experiment}} {{involved an}} electronic ouija board where the device's movements were manipulated by the experimenter, while <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> {{led to believe}} they were entirely self-conducted. The experimenter stopped the device on occasions and asked the participant how much they themselves felt like they wanted to stop. The participant also listened to words in headphones; and {{it was found that}} if experimenter stopped next to an object that came through the headphones {{they were more likely to}} say they wanted to stop there. If the participant perceived having the thought at the time of the action, then it was assigned as intentional. It was concluded that a strong illusion of perception of causality requires; priority (we assume the thought must precede the action), consistency (the thought is about the action), and exclusivity (no other apparent causes or alternative hypotheses).|$|E
50|$|During a whispered speech test, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> {{asked to}} cover the opening of one ear with a finger. The tester will then step back 1 to 2 feet behind <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> and say a series of words in a soft whisper. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> then asked to repeat what <b>is</b> heard. If <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> unable to {{distinguish}} the word, the tester will speak progressively louder until <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> able {{to understand what is}} being said. The other ear is then tested.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> mean <b>participant</b> age <b>was</b> {{approximately}} 66.9 (SD[*]=[*] 7.74) years.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> {{asked to}} read a series of related word-reading and color-naming trials. In the first {{component}} of the task, known as the word-reading condition of <b>the</b> task, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> {{asked to read}} {{as quickly as possible}} a series of color names printed either in white or other various colors. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> then asked to name the color of a series of colored blocks.|$|R
500|$|Coulter and Grewal {{investigated}} if the birthday-number effect {{could be}} exploited {{in sales and}} marketing. Over 200 participants of an online survey were asked about an advertisement for a pasta dinner, where the price was secretly matched to {{the day of the}} month of their birthday. For example, someone born on the 16th [...] of a certain month would see the price $39.16. The researchers found that matching numbers increased price liking and purchase intention. When introducing a perceived threat to the self into the task, they found an exaggerated effect. From this they concluded that the positive affect linked to birthday-numbers transfers directly to consumers’ price predilections, and ultimately affects their purchase intentions. Keller and Gierl sought to replicate Coulter and Grewal's study. They manipulated the prices in advertisements for pizza and a music streaming service to match the birthday (day, year) of the participants in their lab study. They did not find any disproportionate liking of matching prices, neither for the year <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> born in or the day. Keller and Gierl concluded that there must be some prerequisites such as priming stimuli to trigger the effect, although they suggested it is possible that their participants, who all happened to have been born between 1990 and 1999, saw their birthyear as price so often in real life that it had become too common.|$|E
500|$|The regions active during {{engagement}} of cognitive flexibility {{depend on the}} task and various factors involved in flexibility {{that are used to}} assess the behavior, as flexible thinking requires aspects of inhibition, attention, working memory, response selection, and goal maintenance. Several studies using task switching paradigms have demonstrated the complexities of the network involved in cognitive flexibility. [...] Activation of the dorsolateral PFC has been shown during resolution of interference of irrelevant task sets. [...] Another study further extended these results by demonstrating that the level of abstractness of the switch type influenced recruitment of differing regions in the PFC depending on whether <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> asked to make a cognitive set switch, a response switch, or a stimulus or perceptual switch. [...] A set switch would require switching between task rules, as with the WCST, and is considered to be the most abstract. [...] A response switch would require different response mapping, such as circle right button and square left button and vice versa. [...] Lastly, a stimulus or perceptual set switch would require a simple switch between a circle and a square. [...] Activation is mediated by the level of abstractness of the set switch in an anterior to posterior fashion within the PFC, with the most anterior activations elicited by set switches and the most posterior activations resulting from stimulus or perceptual switches. [...] The basal ganglia is active during response selection and the PPC, along with the inferior frontal junction are active during representation and updating of task sets called domain general switching.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the second}} day, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> filmed {{shopping}} {{on her own}} in various New York stores including Mexx, New York & Company, Ann Taylor, Filene's Basement, Searle, H, Bloomingdales, Macy's, and Montmartre. Stacy and Clinton watched the videotaped footage and commented, {{for the benefit of}} the viewers/audience, on whether or not <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> following the [...] "rules".|$|E
30|$|This {{categorization}} {{was supported}} by the way <b>the</b> research <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> assigned to treatment and control groups, as defined by Shadish et al. (2002). During the coding process, two main categories emerged: (a) randomized, where <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> randomly selected and assigned to the treatment or control group, and (b) quasi-experimental, where <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> assigned by <b>the</b> researchers.|$|R
3000|$|... “b 1, b 2, b 3, and b 4 ” codes. Used {{to specify}} the beacon at which <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> {{deprived}} of vision. They indicate the distance where <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> blindfolded: 150, 125, 100, and 75 m respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{washed and}} anointed, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> dressed in <b>the</b> temple garment, a {{religious}} undergarment which <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> instructed to wear throughout {{his or her}} life. (Since 2005, <b>participants</b> in <b>the</b> LDS Church version of the ritual already come clothed in this garment prior to the washing and anointing.) Finally, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> given a [...] "new name" [...] {{which he or she}} is instructed never to reveal except under certain conditions in the temple.|$|R
2500|$|Upon {{seeing the}} initial go-signal, the {{participant}} would immediately intend on pressing the [...] "go" [...] button. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> instructed to cancel their immediate intention {{to press the}} [...] "go" [...] button if they saw a stop signal. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> instructed to select randomly (at their leisure) between either pressing the [...] "go" [...] button, or not pressing it, if they saw a decide signal. Those trials in which the decide signal was shown after the initial go-signal ("decide trials"), for example, required that the participants prevent themselves from acting impulsively on the initial go-signal and then decide what to do. Due to the varying delays, this was sometimes impossible (e.g. some decide signals simply appeared {{too late in the}} process of them both intending to and pressing the go button for them to be obeyed).|$|E
2500|$|Milgram also {{combined}} {{the effect of}} authority with that of conformity. In those experiments, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> joined by one or two additional [...] "teachers" [...] (also actors, like the [...] "learner"). The behavior of the participants' peers strongly affected the results. In Experiment 17, when two additional teachers refused to comply, only 4 of 40 participants continued in the experiment. In Experiment 18, the participant performed a subsidiary task (reading the questions via microphone or recording the learner's answers) with another [...] "teacher" [...] who complied fully. In that variation, 37 of 40 continued with the experiment.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> {{asked at}} the end of those [...] "decide trials" [...] in which they had {{actually}} pressed the go-button whether they had acted impulsively (without enough time to register the decide signal before enacting their intent to press the go-button in response to the initial go-signal stimulus), or had acted based upon a conscious decision made after seeing the decide signal. Based upon the response time data however, it appears there was discrepancy between when the user thought they had had the opportunity to decide (and had therefore not acted on their impulses) – in this case deciding to press the go-button, and when they thought they had acted impulsively (based upon the initial go-signal) – where the decide signal came too late to be obeyed.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> asked non-personally {{identifiable}} information including age; their gender; {{whether they}} live alone {{and if they}} live alone.

5000|$|Session two: Then <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> {{going through}} similar session as session one. The only {{difference}} <b>was</b> that for <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in <b>the</b> smoking cue {{were asked to}} express their minimum price to delay smoking before and after removing the plastic cover off <b>the</b> tray. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> also informed {{that there will be}} a 50% chance that <b>the</b> compensation <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> expressed will <b>be</b> taken into consideration for their real compensation given at the end of the study. In <b>the</b> end, all <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> rewarded five dollars for their participation.|$|R
30|$|The {{instructions}} {{given to}} <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> {{similar to those}} for the lexical decision task. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> to judge whether the phrase was ambiguous and to press “Q” on the keyboard with the left hand if so or “P” {{with his right hand}} if not. In front of these letters were marks indicating what <b>the</b> keys meant. <b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> instructed to react as quickly as possible.|$|R
2500|$|Multivariate pattern {{analysis}} using EEG {{has suggested that}} an evidence based perceptual decision model may be applicable to free will decisions. It was found that decisions could be predicted by neural activity immediately after stimulus perception. Furthermore, when <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> unable to determine {{the nature of the}} stimulus the recent decision history predicted the neural activity (decision). The starting point of evidence accumulation was in effect shifted towards a previous choice (suggesting a priming bias). Another study has found that subliminally priming a participant for a particular decision outcome (showing a cue for 13ms) could be used to influence free decision outcomes. Likewise, it has been found that decision history alone can be used to predict future decisions. The prediction capacities of the Soon et al. (2008) experiment were successfully replicated using a linear SVM model based on participant decision history alone (without any brain activity data). Despite this, a recent study has sought to confirm the applicability of a perceptual decision model to free will decisions. When shown a masked and therefore invisible stimulus, participants were asked to either guess between a category or make a free decision for a particular category. Multivariate {{pattern analysis}} using fMRI could be trained on [...] "free decision" [...] data to successfully predict [...] "guess decisions", and trained on [...] "guess data" [...] in order to predict [...] "free decisions" [...] (in the precuneus and cuneus region).|$|E
