5000|$|A <b>Visite</b> Royale <b>is</b> {{an annual}} {{ambulatory}} inspection by the Royal Court {{of one of}} the Parishes of Jersey. Since 1803 the alternation of <b>the</b> <b>Visites</b> has <b>been</b> fixed so that each Parish is visited once every six years. The origin of the custom goes back to the jurisdiction of the Viscount over the roads and paths of the Duchy of Normandy. The Court inspects the Parish accounts (although since modern practice is that accounts are professionally audited, this is a formality) and receives a report on policing and other matters from the Connétable and Chef de Police. A panel of twelve voyeurs, made up of notable Parishioners nominated by the Connétable, is sworn in and leads the Court on a circuit of roads around the Parish, drawing the Court's attention along the way to transgressions and encroachments that require judgment. The jurisdiction of <b>the</b> <b>Visite</b> Royale <b>is</b> to make [...] "any order designed to ensure the rights of the public lawfully to use the public roads and pathways of the Island without obstruction, hinderance or inconvenience." [...] Judgment is given on the spot, although this may be an order that further investigations should take place and be reported to the Royal Court at a later date.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> (Paris <b>Visite)</b> {{travel card}} <b>is</b> {{available}} for one, two, three or five days, for zones 1–3 covering {{the centre of}} Paris, or zones 1–5 covering {{the whole of the}} network including the RER to the airports, Versailles and Disneyland Paris. It was conceived mainly for visitors and is available through RATP's distributors in the UK, Switzerland and Belgium. It may be a better deal to buy a weekly card (up to €10 saving) but a weekly card runs from Monday to Monday (and is reset every Monday), whereas <b>the</b> Paris <b>Visite</b> card <b>is</b> valid for the number of days purchased.|$|R
5000|$|The Ticket [...] "t+" [...] is not {{the only}} ticket used in Paris public transit: daily cards (Mobilis — or Ticket jeunes for young people on weekends), weekly and monthly cards (formerly {{magnetic}} carte orange, now (2013) chip-computerized contactless Navigo semaine/mois), and yearly cards (Navigo annuel and imagine R for students) are also available. For tourists needing a pass for a specific length of time, <b>the</b> Paris <b>Visite</b> card <b>is</b> also available.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> carte de <b>visite</b> ( [...] , visiting card), {{abbreviated}} CdV, was a type {{of small}} photograph which was patented in Paris by photographer André Adolphe Eugène Disdéri in 1854, although first used by Louis Dodero. It was usually made of an albumen print, which was a thin paper photograph mounted on a thicker paper card. The size of a carte de <b>visite</b> <b>is</b> 2.125 in × 3.5 in mounted on a card sized 2.5 in × 4 in. In 1854, Disdéri had also patented a method of taking eight separate negatives on a single plate, which reduced production costs. <b>The</b> Carte de <b>Visite</b> <b>was</b> slow to gain widespread use until 1859, when Disdéri published Emperor Napoleon III's photos in this format. [...] This made the format an overnight success. The new invention was so popular it was known as [...] "cardomania" [...] and it spread throughout Europe and then quickly to America {{and the rest of}} the world.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> carte de <b>visite</b> <b>was</b> quickly {{replaced}} by the larger cabinet card. In the early 1860s, both types of photographs were essentially the same in process and design. Both were most often albumen prints, the primary difference being the cabinet card was larger and usually included extensive logos and information on the reverse side of the card to advertise the photographer’s services. However, later into its popularity, other types of papers began to replace the albumen process. Despite the similarity, the cabinet card format was initially used for landscape views before it was adopted for portraiture.|$|R
50|$|A <b>visite</b> <b>is</b> a {{specific}} type of woman's outer garment similar to a mantle or wrap. It was particularly popular in the late 19th century, being specifically designed to accommodate the then fashionable bustle. <b>The</b> <b>visite</b> replaced <b>the</b> huge shawls that had previously been worn over large crinoline skirts, combining shawl and coat elements, and was even on occasion made using shawls that were valuable but no longer fashionable.|$|R

The park covers approximately 11,419 hectares of land with 1897 hectares above 2000 meters in elevation, and consists mainly of pine forest, grasslands, and some montane broadleaf forest at an altitude above 1700 m. The Haitian government established <b>the</b> La <b>Visite</b> National Park in 1983. The capital, Port-au-Prince, is only 22 kilometers north from the park.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Visite</b> du Branchage {{takes place}} in each Parish twice a year to check that {{occupiers}} of houses and land bordering on public roads have undertaken the 'branchage'.

5000|$|Photographs had {{previously}} served as calling cards, but Disdéri's {{invention of the}} paper carte de visite (i.e. [...] "visiting card") photograph second enabled the mass production of photographs. On 27 November 1854 he patented the system of printing ten photographs on a single sheet (although {{there is no evidence}} that a system printing more than eight actually materialized). This was the first patent ever for a carte de visite. Disdéri's's cartes de <b>visite</b> <b>were</b> 6&times;9 cm, about the size of conventional (nonphotographic) visiting cards of the time, and were made by a camera with four lenses and a sliding plate holder; a design inspired by the stereoscopic cameras.|$|R
