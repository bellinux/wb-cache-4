5|$|The {{finish of}} a race {{is marked by a}} white line 5cm wide. The {{finishing}} position of athletes is determined by the order in which any part of their torso (as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the nearer edge of the finish line. Fully automatic <b>timing</b> systems (photo <b>timing)</b> {{are becoming more and more}} common at increasingly lower levels of track meets, improving the accuracy, while eliminating the need for eagle-eyed officials on the finish line. Fully automatic <b>timing</b> (FAT) is required for high level meets and any time a (sprint) record is set (though distance records can be accepted if timed by three independent stopwatches).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. From recent high-accuracy transit <b>timings</b> measurements, we {{discard the}} 5 M ⊕ planet {{recently}} proposed by Ribas et al. (2008).

40|$|Most {{approaches}} for optimizing traffic signal <b>timings</b> {{deal with the}} daily traffic. However, {{there are a few}} occasional events like football matches or concerts of musicians that lead to exceptional traffic situations. Still, such events occur more or less regularly and place and time are known in advance. Hence, it is possible to anticipate such events with special signal <b>timings.</b> In this paper, we present an extension of a cyclically time-expanded network flow model and a corresponding mixed-integer linear programming formulation for simultaneously optimizing traffic signal <b>timings</b> and traffic assignment for such events. Besides the mathematical analysis of this approach, we demonstrate its capabilities by computing signal <b>timings</b> for a real world scenario...|$|R

In order to remain truthful, the mechanism must do the same here, so that worker 1 does not gain from lying. However, the makespan can be made half as large by dividing the jobs in [...] equally between the agents.|$|R
