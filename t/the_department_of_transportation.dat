5|$|In 2005, the New Jersey Department of Transportation {{introduced}} {{a case study}} for Route31 for its New Jersey: Future in Transportation project. Over time, the residents and business owners of Raritan Township and Flemington had growing concerns over the congestion along the highway and US202. After trying to use vacant land {{to the east of}} the current alignment, <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Transportation</b> put forth the Flemington Bypass, trying to relieve congestion on Route31 along the commercial district and to provide access to the industrial land between the two highways and the South Branch River. The project was never completed and the proposed site remains undeveloped. <b>The</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Transportation</b> is now looking at a scaled-down bypass, proposed as the South Branch Parkway, to connect Route31 to US202 in Flemington.|$|E

5|$|From 1969 until 2007, the Nassif Building {{served as}} the {{headquarters}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The building was designed to have removable interior walls to permit easy reconfiguration of the interior space. In November 1970, the federal government exercised its powers of eminent domain and seized control of the three-story basement parking garage from Nasif in order to provide inexpensive parking for DOT workers. Over the years, so many government workers complained of ailments while working in the structure that some believed it suffered from sick building syndrome. David Nassif Associates, owner of the building, disputed these claims. However, when <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Transportation</b> announced it would leave the building in 2000, the owners promised a $100 million renovation that included a new air ventilation and cleaning system as an inducement for the agency to stay. The owners also unsuccessfully sued the General Services Administration in 1999 to force it to renew the federal lease on the building. <b>The</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Transportation</b> completed their move out of the Nassif Building and into their new headquarters in June 2007.|$|E

5|$|The Norfolk and Western Railway {{was one of}} {{the twenty}} railroads which joined Amtrak in 1971 but in the first four years hosted no {{passenger}} service over its route, the centerpiece of which was its main line between Norfolk and Cincinnati which passed through the state of West Virginia.

5|$|During the 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Transportation</b> {{looked into}} the {{expansion}} of NY347 and NY454. The studies suggested that the state would add one additional traffic lane in each direction, giving most of the highway six lanes with eight travel lanes along the concurrency in Hauppauge. The new lanes would also be capable of holding rapid-commute vehicles for the Long Island Rapid Commute. The interchange where Routes 347 and 454 fork in Hauppague is slated to go from an at-grade fork to a grade-separated interchange. The project, which will cost $359 million (2009 USD) {{was scheduled to be}} completed between 2012 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{remainder}} of the Boonton Branch was steadily decommissioned through 1963, as the New Jersey Department of Transportation requested the Boonton Branch's alignment through Paterson as part of Interstate 80 and New Jersey Route 21 through Passaic near BE Drawbridge and the Passaic Park station. This {{was turned over to}} <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Transportation</b> on October 27, 1963, after a connection was constructed at Mountain View to the Erie's former New York and Greenwood Lake Railroad. The stretch from Paterson Junction to Totowa, including the Paterson High Bridge built in 1902, was abandoned and soon dismantled. However, despite the changes, the ErieLackawanna continued to lose strength and in 1975, agreed {{to become part of the}} Consolidated Rail Corporation, dubbed Conrail, effective April 1, 1976.|$|E

5|$|Since December 2013, a {{plan has}} been {{underway}} for the Halifax Regional School Board to close and demolish {{at least two of}} the three DMHS feeder schools, as well as DMHS itself, and replace them with a larger, more modern school in Sheet Harbour, that will serve grades primary-12. This new school will teach about 300 students and will serve the large area around Sheet Harbour. On 26 April 2016, the site for the project was chosen; the site that Duncan MacMillan High School currently occupies. A school steering team was established thereafter and cooperates with the design team for the new school, the Halifax Regional School Board and two government departments; <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Transportation</b> and Infrastructure Renewal and the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development for the design and planning phases.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Transportation</b> then {{planned the}} {{extension}} to Interstate 287 in Piscataway, by upgrading Hoes Lane's arterial boulevard and its 20 intersections to standards, eliminating and upgrading several traffic lights. At the intersection with Centennial Avenue, Route 18 will turn off Hoes and follow Centennial to Possumtown Road, {{where it will}} terminate at Interstate 287 exit 8. On February 15, 2012, the New Jersey Department of Transportation broke ground on the project, which is to cost $28 million and was completed in mid-2016. Although NJDOT's road inventory continues to show Route 18 as ending at Hoes Lane and Buckingham Drive in Piscataway, Route 18 signage is complete along the entire route on Hoes Lane and Centennial Ave. to the terminus at Interstate 287, {{as well as on}} signs for exit 8 of I-287. At least one press release suggested that NJDOT considered Route 18 to extend to Interstate 287 as of April 2016.|$|E
5|$|Virgin America secured U.S. investors Black Canyon Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners in late 2005. Once the {{new owners}} were on board, Virgin’s General Counsel {{submitted}} the required U.S. Department of Transportation certificate application on December 9, 2005. Unfortunately, despite significant {{public support for the}} new California-based airline, the approval process was mired with debate between the support and opposition of the new airline. City and state representatives from California and New York led the support for the airline, while the biggest opposition came from a national aviation labor union, Air Line Pilots Association, as well as the pre-existing Houston, Texas-based competitor Continental Airlines. The review of Virgin America's application was prolonged due to this opposition, which claimed Virgin America, being a subsidiary of the United Kingdom-based Virgin Group, would not be under U.S. ownership or control. The application was initially denied by <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Transportation</b> on December 27, 2006.|$|E
