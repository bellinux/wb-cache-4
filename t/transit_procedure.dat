40|$|This paper uses {{a growth}} {{diagnostics}} approach à la Hausmann, Rodrik, and Velasco (HRV) {{to identify the}} most'binding'constraints to private sector growth in Mongolia - a small, low-income, mineral-rich, transition economy. The approach of applying the HRV methodology is useful in those cases where a lack of data prevents us from estimating shadow prices to identify the most'binding'constraint to growth. We find that although Mongolia is not liquidity constrained and has grown rapidly in recent years, economic growth has been narrowly based. Investment has flowed mainly into {{a small number of}} firms operating in mining and construction. The low level of private investment in sectors outside mining and construction has been due to low returns - a result of costly and unreliable transportation services; lengthy and complex <b>transit</b> <b>procedures,</b> including customs and trade rules; distortionary taxes; coordination failures, at both domestic and international levels; and growing corruption. Poor financial intermediation is also a problem that has kept the cost of finance high, although lower than in previous years.

40|$|The uptake of {{nutrients}} occurs {{mainly in the}} small bowel. However, the time nutrients and other contents spend in the small bowel, i. e. the small bowel transit time is widely uncharacterised in man. Available methods for studying small bowel transit are expensive, time consuming and have limited accessibility. The aim {{was to develop a}} practical method for studying small bowel transit as well as gastric emptying and colonic transit in one day. The second aim was to characterise gastrointestinal transit in health and in some common gastrointestinal diseases. The method was based on the use of radiopaque spheres in a test meal to measure gastric emptying and small bowel transit. The spheres were followed using fluoroscopy. Colonic transit was based on ten radiopaque rings given daily for six days with fluoroscopy on day seven, i. e. the measurement day. Detailed gastrointestinal transit parameters were obtained in a large number of healthy subjects as well as in patients with celiac disease before and after treatment and in patients with liver disease and portal hypertension. In addition, patients with idiopathic bile acid malabsorption were studied prospectively. In total 636 transit measurements in healthy subjects and different patients were performed. This one-day <b>transit</b> measurement <b>procedure</b> was non-invasive, reproducible and inexpensive and it was easy to perform. The radiation exposure during the measurement was 2 mS, which is less than the one-year background radiation in Sweden. In healthy subjects, women had slower transit in all segments of the gut. Overweight healthy women had faster small bowel transit and faster transit through the distal colon compared with lean women. The majority of patients with idiopathic bile acid malabsorption were overweight and had accelerated transit in the small bowel and distal colon compared with healthy subjects. Delayed small bowel transit was observed in male patients with untreated celiac disease and in male patients with liver disease. Body mass index increased and small bowel transit accelerated in the celiac patients after treatment. In women with untreated celiac disease, overweight was associated with faster small bowel transit. In liver disease, Small bowel bacterial overgrowth was associated with delayed small bowel transit. Conclusions: This newly developed <b>transit</b> measurement <b>procedure</b> is a valuable tool for the evaluation of large patient materials with suspected transit abnormalities. Gender influences gut transit in health and may influence transit in disease. The association of overweight with accelerated transit {{on the one hand and}} celiac disease and liver disease, i. e. disorders of malnutrition with delayed transit, on the other, indicates that gastrointestinal transit may adapt to varying nutritional status in man...|$|R

Unlike other schedule-based {{models in the}} literature, we consider supply uncertainties and assume that users adopt strategies to travel from their origins to their destinations. We present an analytical formulation to ensure that on-board passengers continuing to the next stop have priority and waiting passengers are loaded on a first-come-first-serve basis. We propose an analytical model that captures the stochastic nature of the transit schedules and in-vehicle travel times due to road conditions, incidents, or adverse weather. We adopt a mean variance approach that can consider the covariance of travel time between links in a space time graph but still lead to a robust <b>transit</b> network loading <b>procedure</b> when optimal strategies are adopted. The proposed model is formulated as a user equilibrium problem and solved by an MSA-type algorithm.

It has been hypothesized that by excluding duodenum and jejunum from nutrient <b>transit</b> this <b>procedure</b> may reduce putative {{signals from the}} proximal intestine which negatively influence insulin sensitivity. To test this hypothesis, resection or bypass of different intestinal segments were performed in diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) and Wistar rats. Rats {{were randomly assigned to}} 5 groups: duodenal-jejunal bypass (DJB), jejunal resection (jejunectomy), ileal resection (ileectomy), pair-fed sham-operated, and non-operated controls. Oral glucose-tolerance test was performed within 2 weeks after surgery. Baseline and post-stimulation levels of glucose, insulin, glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic-polypeptide (GIP) were measured. Minimal-model analysis was used to assess insulin sensitivity (SI). Insulin sensitivity improved after DJB (SI = 1. 14 ± 0. 32 × 10 - 4 min- 1 ⋅pM- 1) and jejunectomy (SI = 0. 80 ± 0. 14 × 10 - 4 min- 1 ⋅pM- 1), but not after ileectomy or sham operation/pair-feeding in diabetic rats. Both DJB and jejunal resection normalized insulin sensitivity in diabetic rats as shown by SI levels equivalent to those of Wistar rats (SI= 1. 01003 F 0. 06003 F 10 - 4 min- 1 ⋅pM- 1, P=NS). Glucose effectiveness did not change after operations in any group. While ileectomy increased plasma GIP levels, no changes in GIP or GLP- 1 were observed after DJB and jejunectomy. These findings support the hypothesis that anatomic alterations of the proximal small bowel may reduce factor/s with negative influence on insulin sensitivity therefore contributing to the control of diabetes after gastric bypass surgery...|$|R

Intestinal resections of great magnitude are mostly done as extreme efforts to correct many conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, trauma, mesenteric vascular disease, volvulus, congenital atre-sias, and neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.

With this goal, this study developed two test methods as well as apparatus/measuring tool to observe a palletized load’s overall stability.

A <b>transit</b> route evaluation <b>procedure</b> established route potential {{on the basis of}} demographic and transit service factors. The procedure was to provide a framework for selecting the best service policies to undertake when a reallocation of system resources was considered. The Des Moines Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) fixed-route system, a radial transit system, was selected for evaluating the transit use potential at the route level;A stiffness concept applied in structural analysis was used to estimate route ridership under varying supply conditions. The stiffness is more than trip generation from an area. Its function is to simultaneously measure a trip generation and distribution effect by incorporating both production and attraction capabilities along a route. Multiple regression techniques were valuable for sorting through the many eligible explanatory variables regarding transit ridership. The observation unit in regression analysis was a route-segment. Passenger density, the stiffness for each route-segment, was used as a dependent variable. Passenger density was represented by on-off-passengers per unit length of route-segment. The number of on-off-passengers is the sum of the number of on-passengers and the number of off-passengers. Frequency of service was always found to be the most significant independent variable. Other independent variables that are significant in explaining variations included population density, employment density, and travel time factor;A linear programming model was used to optimize the transit route {{on the basis of the}} demand and system constraints.

40|$|The {{inland waters}} of Ghana have a {{considerable}} {{potential for the}} operation of inland water transport (IWT) services. These services {{could be part of}} a multimodal transport corridor, to connect the northern regions and the northern landlocked countries with the industrial southern part of the country, which also includes the port of Tema, one of the gateways of the landlocked countries. However, despite the many advantages of IWT, these waters are currently barely used for freight transportation. The absence of a high quality IWT service is mainly unfortunate, as Ghana suffers from the consequences of the unilateral road transport market: the many trucks leads to congestions, traffic hazards and long (and unreliable) transport times. Besides this, the freight transportation by road is rather expensive. An IWT service on the Ghanaian inland waters could be able to improve the cost and time performances of the Ghanaian transit corridor. The Ghanaian inland waters are mainly formed by Lake Volta and the upstream Volta Rivers. The water levels of these waters are subject to the local climate, which results in (very) low water levels during the dry season (from November to July). The water levels of Lake Volta allow year round navigation, but that does not hold for the Volta Rivers. In fact, Buipe Port, along the Black Volta, is probably the most upstream location that can be reached for most part of the year, while a year round accessibility can be guaranteed after dredging a shoal, a bit downstream of the port. The potential container market for the IWT service is quite small, being about 8, 000 TEUs per year. Nearly all these containers are currently transported by road from Tema Port to Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Due to the congestions and (bad) conditions of roads and trucks, the northbound journey (about 1, 000 km) takes about four days. The corresponding price for transport is also very high, being about USD 2, 600 for a 20 ft. container. The only commercial IWT service at Lake Volta, is not able to deliver better performances, due to bad and inappropriate equipment. The feasibility of three different IWT services is investigated: roll-on/roll-off of truck/trailer combinations or roll trailers on the one hand, and lift-on/lift-off of containers on the other hand. All the alternatives are based on the concept of barges being pushed by push tugs, as this is the most promising concept from a financial point of view. It can be concluded that the potential transit container market of 8, 000 TEU/year, for which the IWT service has to compete for, is too small to result in a profitable service. However, when relocating the <b>transit</b> traffic (clearance) <b>procedures</b> from Tema Port to Buipe Port, the yearly container throughput via Lake Volta will be much higher, making an IWT service viable and profitable. Besides, this relocation will result in extra space in the port of Tema, and can result in more efficient clearance procedures, thereby decreasing the total door-to-door time of transit traffic. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The United States energy {{information}} administration states that more that 50 % of commuters drive their own cars to work. This implies that traffic congestion can be mitigated if public transit service can take {{a larger share of}} commuting trips. However, a commuter's choice depends on the utility associated with each available mode. Transit service must be improved to increase its utility and therefore attract more riders. To improve customer satisfaction and reduce operation costs, transit authorities have been striving to monitor their transit service quality and identify the key factors to attract the transit riders. Traditional manual data collection methods are unable to satisfy the transit system optimization and performance measurement requirement due to their expensive and labor-intensive nature. The recent advent of passive data collection techniques (e. g. Automated Fare Collection and Automated Vehicle Location) has shifted a data-poor environment to a data-rich environment, and offered opportunities for transit agencies to conduct comprehensive transit system performance measures. Although it is possible to collect highly valuable information from ubiquitous transit data, data usability and accessibility are still difficult to improve due to the following reasons: (1) most Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) systems are not designed for transit performance monitoring, hence additional passenger trip information cannot be directly retrieved. (2) Each passive data collection method has its intractable disadvantages, and requires additional domain knowledge to process. Interoperating and mining heterogeneous datasets would enhance both the depth and breadth of transit-related studies. (3) The amount of data involved is increasingly growing, and traditional data processing applications might not be suitable to handle in an efficient fashion. Such data barriers hinder the development of a large-scale transit performance monitoring system. This study attempts to fill these research gaps by developing a series of data mining algorithms for transit rider's origin and destination information extraction with transit Smart Card (SC) data. The primary data source of this study comes from the AFC system in Beijing, where a passenger's boarding stop (origin) and alighting stop (destination) on a flat-rate bus are not recorded on the check-in and check-out scan. A Markov chain based Bayesian decision tree algorithm is proposed to mine the passengers' origin information using SC data. In addition, this study further proposes an integrated data mining procedure that models the travel patterns and regularities of <b>transit</b> riders. This <b>procedure</b> is able to incorporate transit riders' trip chains based on their temporal and spatial characteristics, and capture their historical travel patterns in an efficient manner. Then, {{on the basis of the}} identified travel patterns, the individual-level destination can be estimated with transfer analysis through a multi-day observation. Finally, to remove data accessibility barriers, facilitate data sharing and visualization, and conduct online data analysis for transit performance measures, an e-science of transportation platform entitled TransitNet is developed. TransitNet enables the connections and interoperability among the heterogeneous transit data sets including SC data, GPS data and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This platform not only serves as a data-rich visualization platform to monitor transit network performance for planning and operations, it also intends to take advantage of e-science developments for data-driven transportation research and applications...|$|R
