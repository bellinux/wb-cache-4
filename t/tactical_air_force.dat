5|$|The first {{official}} sortie of No.410 Squadron was from RAF Drem, East Lothian, Scotland, {{on the night}} of 4 June 1942, when twelve Beaufighter crews took off, and it {{went on to become the}} top-scoring night fighter squadron in the RAF Second <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> during the period between D-Day and VE-Day.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, a {{division}} of the Meteorological Office was established at RAF Uxbridge as part of the Intelligence Branch. On 1 July that year the station Sick Quarters were merged with the WAAF hospital to create the RAF Station Hospital. No. 11 Group was involved in providing air support for the Dieppe Raid (Operation Jubilee) on 19 August 1942. Air Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory commanded participating Allied air forces from the 11Group Operation Room. The air operations section of Operation Overlord, the 6 June 1944 Normandy landings (D-Day), was also controlled from RAF Uxbridge. Orders from the station were the only ones issued to Allied air units on the day. The headquarters of the 2nd <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> and 9th <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> of the USAAF were stationed at Uxbridge while preparations were made for the invasion. On D-Day, the 11Group Controller was responsible for ensuring sufficient air patrols of the United Kingdom, the main shipping routes, and the beach landing areas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of December, under bad weather conditions, the Nazis {{launched}} an offensive in the Ardennes. The Luftwaffe caught many squadrons off guard. No.410 Squadron enjoyed a number of successes during this period, some of them even on Christmas Day. During the Battle of the Bulge, the entire RAF Second <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force,</b> including No.410 Squadron, was on 48-hour alert.|$|E

5|$|By early 1944, No.9 Operational Group {{had become}} a static {{garrison}} force for the New Guinea area, and was renamed Northern Command in April to better reflect its new role. The following month No.71 Wing, now led by Wing Commander Ralph Moran, advanced to Nadzab, where it came {{under the control of}} No.10 Operational Group (later the Australian First <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force).</b> There Nos.8 and 100 Squadrons engaged in attacks on Japanese positions in Wewak, each flying over 140 sorties during the month.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1943, No. 9 OG, {{originally}} the RAAF's mobile strike formation, had effectively become a static garrison force in New Guinea. Bostock proposed that it be renamed Northern Area Command to better reflect its current function. Kenney asked Bostock to raise a new RAAF mobile formation, {{which led to the}} establishment of No.10 Operational Group (No.10 OG) on 13November 1943 at Nadzab, under the command of Group Captain Frederick Scherger. In February 1944, RAAF Command took over many of the units of No.9 OG, as well as responsibility for the Port Moresby and Milne Bay sectors. Bostock again recommended changing No.9 OG's name to Northern Area, and also proposed changing No.10 OG's name to <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force,</b> RAAF, in view of its increased strength from the infusion of new squadrons. No.9 OG became Northern Command on 11April. On 14September, Bostock had an audience with Prime Minister Curtin, wherein the latter outlined his preferences for the deployment of RAAF Command, particularly that it should be represented in forward Allied operations, and employed primarily in the support of Australian ground forces. Bostock concurred; Curtin meanwhile authorised changing No.10 OG's name to First <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> (No.1 TAF), with effect from 25October. RAAF Command's complement had now swelled to forty-one Australian squadrons.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{order of}} battle {{involved}} all the major commands in the area at the time. The Supreme Allied Air Force Command was the Mediterranean Air Command (MAD) under Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder. Below the supreme command were the sector organisations, the Northwest African Air Forces (NAAF) commanded by Carl Spaatz. Directly subordinated to Spaatz was the Northwest African Strategic Air Force (NASAF) under James H. Doolittle. The second command was the operational/tactical force, the Northwest African <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> (NATAF) under Air Marshal Arthur Coningham.|$|E
50|$|In May 1964, Genéral Marie, FAS commander, was {{replaced}} by Général Philippe Maurin, former commander of the <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Forces</b> (FATAC) and French <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> {{chief of staff in}} 1967.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the doctrinal and practical development of <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>forces</b> by the Royal <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> {{until the end}} of the Second World War. It focuses on the fundamental disagreements over the uses of air power, the preference for a strategic vision and the pressing need for <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>forces</b> in the face of the exigencies of war. This paper will trace the gradual provision of air support to the land forces and the formidable and fundamental changes that occurred during operations in various theatres in the Second World War...|$|R
50|$|In October 1944 the {{squadron}} returned to France {{to join the}} <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>forces</b> that were supporting the Allied armies as they advanced across Europe. The squadron was finally disbanded on 4 April 1945.|$|R
5|$|To help {{overcome}} the static {{nature of the}} area command system, in September 1942 the RAAF created a large mobile formation known as No.9 (Operational) Group, a self-contained <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>force</b> that could keep pace with Allied advances north through New Guinea and towards Japan. By April 1944, No.9 Group had become a garrison force in New Guinea and lost its mobile function to No.10 (Operational) Group (later the Australian First <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force).</b> No.9 Group was therefore re-formed as a dedicated area command covering air units in New Guinea; Bostock had recommended calling it Northern Area, before RAAF Headquarters settled on Northern Command. In August that year, RAAF Headquarters proposed disbanding the training and maintenance groups formed in 1941–42 and return their functions to {{the control of the}} area commands, but no action was taken. The same month, the Air Board recommended carving a new Central Area Command out of Eastern Area, which it considered too large to be controlled by one headquarters. This proposed Central Area would have been responsible for units in southern Queensland but the War Cabinet deferred its decision, as it had when a similar concept was raised in October 1943.|$|E
5|$|After a brief posting as Director of Air Staff Policy at RAAF Headquarters, Rawlinson succeeded Wilf Arthur as {{commander}} of No.78 (Fighter) Wing at Tarakan on 25May 1945. The wing {{came under the}} control of the First <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force,</b> which had taken over No.9 Group's mobile role and was supporting Australian forces during the Borneo campaign. No.78 Wing's complement included Nos.75, 78 and 80 Squadrons, operating Kittyhawks, and several ancillary units. In June and July, the wing took part in the assaults on Labuan and Balikpapan, undertaking convoy escort in the former and, joined by Spitfires of No.452 Squadron, ground-attack missions in support of the 7th Division in the latter.|$|E
5|$|Established at Ballarat, Victoria, on 12April 1944, No.81 Wing {{operated}} P-40 Kittyhawk {{fighters in}} the South West Pacific theatre of World WarII. Group Captain Gordon Steege set up headquarters on Los Negros in the Admiralty Islands on 30August. Comprising Nos.76, 77 and 82 Squadrons, the formation joined Nos.77 and 78 Wings on Noemfoor {{as part of}} No.10 Operational Group in September 1944. No.10 Group was renamed the First <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> (No.1 TAF) in October. The same month, No.81 Wing undertook offensive sweeps and ground attacks against targets in West Papua. In November, Nos.77 and 82 Squadrons dive bombed Japanese airfields on Halmahera.|$|E
50|$|He assumed {{command of}} the 4th Allied <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Forces</b> and U.S. <b>Air</b> <b>Forces</b> in Europe on July 1, 1961, {{succeeding}} General Frederic H. Smith, Jr., who was named vice chief of staff, Headquarters U.S. <b>Air</b> <b>Force.</b> He retired from the <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> on July 1, 1963, and died on January 27, 1986.|$|R
50|$|The {{air interdiction}} model {{consisting}} of coastal, strategic, and <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>forces</b> {{was presented to}} the Casablanca planners by Tedder who along with primarily Lloyd, Ritchie, and especially Coningham, implemented and developed the model during the successful campaigns in Egypt and Libya.|$|R
50|$|Following World War II, Ninth <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> was {{reactivated}} on 28 March 1946 at Biggs AAF, Texas. After several relocations, on 20 August 1954, Ninth <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> Headquarters {{was assigned}} to Shaw <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> Base, South Carolina, where it remains today. The postwar Numbered <b>Air</b> <b>Forces</b> were components of the new major command structure of the United States <b>Air</b> <b>Force,</b> and Ninth <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> {{became one of the}} <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>forces</b> of the new <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> Command. Ninth <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> commanded TAC Wings east of the Mississippi River.|$|R
5|$|First <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> (No.1 TAF), {{commanded}} by Air Commodore Harry Cobby, {{was the main}} frontline combat formation of the RAAF in 1944–45. It fell under the operational control of United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Lieutenant General George Kenney, the Allied air forces commander in the South West Pacific Area under General Douglas MacArthur. Initially made up of one Bristol Beaufighter and two P-40 Kittyhawk wings, No.1 TAF was augmented in 1945 by No.80 Wing, {{commanded by}} Group Captain Clive Caldwell. This wing comprised three Supermarine Spitfire squadrons, whose pilots included veterans of the North African Campaign and the defence of Northern Australia against Japanese air raids.|$|E
5|$|Morotai {{remained}} an important Allied base after Leyte was secured. Aircraft of the Thirteenth Air Force and Australian First <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> (formerly No. 10 Operational Group RAAF) were based at Morotai and attacked {{targets in the}} NEI and southern Philippines {{until the end of}} the war. From April 1945, the island was also used by the Australian I Corps to mount the Borneo Campaign. Australian Army engineers expanded the base facilities at Morotai to support this operation. Due to overcrowding, some Australian camp sites were located outside the American perimeter.|$|E
5|$|No.410 Squadron was {{the third}} RCAF night fighter {{squadron}} to be formed and was equipped with the Boulton Paul Defiant. In May 1942 these were replaced by the Bristol Beaufighter, and in October {{of the same year}} these were in turn replaced with De Havilland Mosquito Mk IIs, with which the first victory for the squadron was claimed. No.410 Squadron was acknowledged as the top-scoring night fighter unit in RAF Second <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> in the period between D-Day and VE Day, although No. 409 Squadron RCAF can now make a similar claim, on the basis that there were many victories quickly counted up during 1944 and 1945.|$|E
50|$|After D-Day as allied <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>forces</b> moved rapidly across France, {{investment}} in base and aircraft survival was impractical. It was quicker and cheaper to use captured Luftwaffe facilities. By 1948 these small airfields {{had been abandoned}} and most structures were removed or were {{in a state of}} disrepair.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 4 May 1945, Bär {{gathered}} the pilots of JV 44 for a final briefing.

50|$|On 1 October 1953 he was {{appointed}} Assistant Chief of the Air Staff with responsibility for RAF training. On 22 January 1956 {{he was promoted to}} acting air marshal and appointed as Commander in Chief of the 2nd <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Forces.</b> In July 1957 his promotion to air marshal was made permanent and he {{was appointed}} Commander in Chief, Far East <b>Air</b> <b>Force.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{offensive}} achieved {{surprise and}} much initial success. To counter the {{attack from the}} air, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) handed operational control of its XXIX Tactical Air Command and part of its Ninth Air Force, {{under the command of}} Major General Hoyt Vandenberg, to the RAF and Arthur Coningham. On 23 December, the RAF Second <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> provided the American forces with much needed support, and helped prevent a German capture of Malmedy and Bastogne. This left the Germans with only the logistical bottleneck of St. Vith to support their operations. The German attack faltered.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of most of Australian New Guinea the RAAF and RAN participated in the US-led Western New Guinea campaign, which had the goal of {{securing}} bases {{to be used to}} mount {{the liberation of}} the Philippines. Australian warships and the fighter, bomber and airfield construction squadrons of No.10Operational Group RAAF participated in the capture of Hollandia, Biak, Noemfoor and Morotai. After western New Guinea was secured No.10Operation Group was renamed the First <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> (1TAF) and was used to protect the flank of the Allied advance by attacking Japanese positions in the NEI and performing other garrison tasks. The losses incurred whilst performing these relatively unimportant roles led to a decline in morale, and contributed to the 'Morotai Mutiny' in April 1945.|$|E
5|$|Australia's {{role in the}} Pacific War {{declined}} from 1944. The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government {{to reduce the size}} of the armed forces to boost war production. Nevertheless, the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active, and agreed to MacArthur's proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns. In late 1944, Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea, New Britain, and Bougainville, and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there. In May 1945, I Corps, the Australian First <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> and USAAF and USN units began the Borneo Campaign, which continued until the end of the war. These campaigns contributed little to Japan's defeat and remain controversial.|$|E
50|$|The 510th led the <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Forces</b> {{with the}} first combat use of Night Vision Goggles in an F-16 during Operation Deliberate Guard. The 510th led the way by {{being one of the}} first F-16 units to become Forward Air Controllers (FAC-A), and were the first to employ as FAC-A's in combat in the F-16.|$|R
50|$|The USAF modernized its <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>forces</b> in {{the late}} 1970s with the {{introduction}} of the F-15, A-10, and F-16 fighters, and the implementation of realistic training scenarios under the aegis of Red Flag. In turn, it also upgraded the equipment and capabilities of its Air Reserve Components (ARC) by the equipping of both the Air National Guard and <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> Reserve with first-line aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|The {{center was}} {{initially}} established as the Air and Space Command and Control Agency (ASC2A) on 1 August 1997. The agency included {{the two major}} field units that became the <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> C2 Battlelab and the <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> C2 Training and Innovation Group. The <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Forces</b> Interoperability Group (TAFIG) was a predecessor organization under <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> Command. It was focused primarily on tactical interoperability and was {{a leader in the}} improvement and integration of Tactical Data Links and message text formats, a responsibility AFC2IC carries on today.|$|R
5|$|By noon of 7 August, {{the early}} morning fog had dispersed, and large numbers of Allied {{aircraft}} appeared over the battlefield. With the advance knowledge of the attack provided by Ultra, the U.S. 9th Air Force had been reinforced by the RAF Second <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force.</b> Despite assurances by the Luftwaffe that German forces would have adequate air support, the Allied aircraft quickly achieved complete control of the airspace over Mortain. The Luftwaffe reported that its fighters were engaged by Allied aircraft {{from the moment they}} took off, and were unable even to reach the battlefield. In the open ground east of Mortain, the German Panzers became exposed targets, especially for rocket-firing Hawker Typhoon fighter bombers of the RAF.|$|E
5|$|For {{three months}} Braham {{remained}} inactive. In February 1944 he was posted to No. 2 Group RAF as 'wing commander night operations' {{attached to the}} 2nd Light Bomber Group, RAF Second <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force.</b> Although a staff officer at HQ, Braham was able, with persistence, to persuade his commanding officer, Air Vice Marshal Basil Embry {{to allow him to}} 'free-lance' intruder operations using a De Havilland Mosquito loaned from one of the various squadrons in the group on the proviso he asked his permission beforehand. Braham also had his former radar operators transferred to the group's headquarters so he could fly with them. He frequently borrowed aircraft from No. 613 Squadron RAF.|$|E
5|$|No. 73 Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) wing of World WarII. It {{was formed}} in February 1943 at Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, as part of No.9 Operational Group. The wing {{initially}} comprised three attack squadrons flying CAC Wirraways, Douglas Bostons, and Bristol Beaufighters, with which it {{took part in the}} New Guinea campaign until mid-year. It was then reorganised with three fighter squadrons operating P-40 Kittyhawks and Supermarine Spitfires; in this form it saw action in the New Britain and Admiralty Islands campaigns through 1943–44. The wing was disbanded at Los Negros in August 1944, and by the beginning of 1945 its squadrons had been absorbed into other RAAF wings under No.10 Operational Group (later the Australian First <b>Tactical</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force).</b>|$|E
50|$|This model which {{separated}} the command into strategic, coastal, and <b>tactical</b> <b>air</b> <b>forces</b> {{was presented to}} the Casablanca planners by Tedder who along with primarily Ritchie, Lloyd, and especially Coningham, implemented and developed the tri-force model in Egypt and Libya during 1942. As the strategic component of the original tri-force, No. 205 Group contributed significantly to these developments.|$|R
