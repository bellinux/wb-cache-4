50|$|Right-Angle weave stitch, {{also known}} as RAW, is an off-loom bead weaving technique. Beads are {{stitched}} together with thread only making right angle turns, hence the name. The result is an almost fabric like piece of beadwork. Right-Angle weave can be woven with either one needle or two. With single needle right-angle weave, the <b>thread</b> <b>path</b> moves in a figure-eight pattern. For double needle right-angle weave, the threads cross each other along the center bead of each stitch as they head in opposite directions. RAW can be formed into flat pieces, tubes, or 3 dimensional figures. There are also variations on the basic stich like cubic right angle weave, or CRAW. Seed beads, fire polished beads and crystal beads are common choices in pieces using right-angle weave.|$|E

The current academic system in the Netherlands, like in many other places around the world (Powell, 2015), is not designed to have scientists staying in a postdoc position forever. So, you are either deemed good enough to become a permanent staff member, or you have to leave academia at some point and try your luck in a pharmaceutical company or elsewhere. I had not succeeded in the former, but I also did not want to do the latter, so I took a less <b>threaded</b> <b>path</b> and headed to China.|$|R
40|$|We present Symbiosis: a {{concurrency}} debugging technique {{based on}} novel differential schedule projections (DSPs). A DSP shows the small set of memory operations and data-flows {{responsible for a}} failure, {{as well as a}} reordering of those elements that avoids the failure. To build a DSP, Symbiosis first generates a full, failing, multithreaded schedule via <b>thread</b> <b>path</b> profiling and symbolic con-straint solving. Symbiosis selectively reorders events in the failing schedule to produce a non-failing, alternate schedule. A DSP re-ports the ordering and data-flow differences between the failing and non-failing schedules. Our evaluation on buggy real-world software and benchmarks shows that, in practical time, Symbiosis generates DSPs that both isolate the small fraction of event orders and data-flows responsible for the failure, and show which event reorderings prevent failing. In our experiments, DSPs contain 81 % fewer events and 96 % fewer data-flows than the full failure-inducing schedules. Moreover, by allowing developers to focus on only a few events, DSPs reduce the amount of time required to find a valid fix...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnitude}} of the rolling force applied to the workpiece (1) by rolling tools (9, 10), at least during an initial plunge phase, is controlled dependent on the difference of the contact lengths between the workpiece and respectively the rolling tools (9) and (10). As a result, the workpiece is periodically subjected to a rolling force {{in such a way}} that the maximum and minimum of this force correspond to the zero and maximum difference of the contact lengths. The profile rolling machine is provided with at least one sensor (8, 16) for determining the angle of rotation of the rolling tools and hence their contact length difference. Signals from this sensor are fed to a control unit governing the rolling spindle drive. USE - For production of screw profiles with one, three or five <b>thread</b> <b>paths.</b> ADVANTAGE - Screw profiles produced according to the invention require little or no corrective machining before their installation...|$|R

40|$|We present CLAP, a new {{technique}} to reproduce concurrency bugs. CLAP has two key steps. First, it logs <b>thread</b> local execution <b>paths</b> at runtime. Second, offline, it computes memory dependencies that accord with the logged execution {{and are able to}} reproduce the observed bug. The second step works by combining constraints from the <b>thread</b> <b>paths</b> and constraints based on a memory model, and computing an execution with a constraint solver. CLAP has four major advantages. First, logging purely local execution of each thread is substantially cheaper than logging memory interactions, which enables CLAP to be efficient compared to previous approaches. Second, our logging does not require any synchronization and hence with no added memory barriers or fences; this minimizes perturbation and missed bugs due to extra synchronizations foreclosing certain racy behaviors. Third, since it uses no synchronization, we extend CLAP to work on a range of relaxed memory models, such as TSO and PSO, in addition to sequential consistency. Fourth, CLAP can compute a much simpler execution than the original one, that reveals the bug with minimal thread context switches. To mitigate the scalability issues, we also present an approach to parallelize constraint solving, which theoretically scales our technique to programs with arbitrary execution length. Experimental results on a variety of multithreaded benchmarks and real world concurrent applications validate these advantages by showing that our technique is effective in reproducing concurrency bugs even under relaxed memory models; furthermore, it is significantly more efficient than a state-of-the-art technique that records shared memory dependencies, reducing execution time overhead by 45 % and log size by 88 % on average. 1...|$|R

40|$|The dual {{function}} of the Environmental Design Assistant which we have developed is to act firstly as a teaching aid and secondly as a design aid. In terms of it's role as a design assistant it is similar in nature to the application described by Papamichael, K, in Novitski, B. J. (1993). However, the work described here forms {{part of an overall}} strategy to develop a user friendly design assistant across the spectrum of Architectural design disciplines: this is one particular strand of the project. One aim embodied {{in the development of the}} environmental design assistant has been the pragmatic one of the production and refining of a tool to perform environmental assessments of buildings in accordance with the British recommendations made in BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Energy Assessment Method). In this respect the assistant allows for the consequences of design decisions to be readily assessed and then for those decisions to be modified. The Assistant has undergone a series of refinements to make it more user-friendly, efficient and appropriate as an Architectural design aid, and this has been the second aim of the project. The project has acted as a vehicle for the application of design principles applied to the presentation, information structuring and navigation associated with Hypermedia and Multimedia products. We are applying the kind of good design principles which have been summarised well by Schulmeister, R. (1994). These principles include Ariadne's <b>Thread</b> (<b>paths</b> for navigation), Lost in Hyperspace (backward navigation), More-than-browsing (interaction) and Tutoring (providing feedback to the user). Adoption of such principles is, we believe, essential in order to realise the potential of Hypermedia tools. The principal development tool for the work has been SuperCard. This has been used in conjunction with a range of other software including ArchiCad and Intellidraw and a range of image grabbing devices...|$|R
