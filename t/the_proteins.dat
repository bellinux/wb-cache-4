5|$|Archaea {{are genetically}} {{distinct}} from bacteria and eukaryotes, {{with up to}} 15% of <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> encoded by any one archaeal genome being unique to the domain, although most of these unique genes have no known function. Of {{the remainder of the}} unique proteins that have an identified function, most belong to the Euryarchaea and are involved in methanogenesis. <b>The</b> <b>proteins</b> that archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes share form a common core of cell function, relating mostly to transcription, translation, and nucleotide metabolism. Other characteristic archaeal features are the organization of genes of related function—such as enzymes that catalyze steps in the same metabolic pathway into novel operons, and large differences in tRNA genes and their aminoacyl tRNA synthetases.|$|E
5|$|Assembly – Following the structure-mediated {{self-assembly}} of {{the virus}} particles, some modification of <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> often occurs. In viruses such as HIV, this modification (sometimes called maturation) occurs after the virus has been released from the host cell.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{biological}} macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins {{are essential}} parts of organisms {{and participate in}} virtually every process within cells. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle. In animals, proteins are needed in the diet to provide the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized. Digestion breaks <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> down {{for use in the}} metabolism.|$|E
50|$|C6orf222 {{contains}} a single domain of unknown function, DUF3292, found between amino acid residues 38-110. <b>The</b> <b>protein</b> is proline rich but asparagine and tyrosine poor. The charge distribution of <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> is fairly equal {{in that there}} are no positive or negative charge clusters sequestered within the protein.The secondary structures of <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> were predicted via multiple bioinformatics servers. All four programs predicted extensive disorder in <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> at <b>the</b> N-terminus, ranging from 79% to 88% of <b>the</b> <b>protein.</b> This extent of disorder is consistent with the amino acid composition of <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> and being proline rich. There were several α-helix structures predicted at the C-terminus of <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> and conserved in orthologs of <b>the</b> human <b>protein.</b> <b>The</b> <b>protein</b> was predominantly soluble, with a majority of the amino acid residues being exposed.15 The average of hydrophobicity for c6orf222 was -0.968, indicating the soluble nature of <b>the</b> <b>protein.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>protein</b> is encoded by TMEM134 {{gene and}} is 195 amino acids in length. <b>The</b> <b>protein</b> {{contains}} two transmembrane domains {{but does not}} contain a signal peptide. This {{suggests that there is}} an internal signal peptide upstream of the translated portion of <b>the</b> <b>protein.</b> <b>The</b> <b>protein</b> is overall considering normal with its amino acid content but does have two regions of high hydrophobicity, which occur during the transmembrane regions of <b>the</b> <b>protein.</b> This gives <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> an isoelectric point of 6.08. The overall weight of <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> is 21.6 kilodaltons, which is conserved throughout the different orthologs. <b>The</b> <b>protein</b> also contains a domain of unknown function 872 (DUF872). Currently there is no thought to the possible function of this domain.|$|R
50|$|Basic {{conditions}} and detergents, such as SDS, {{can interfere with}} the dye's ability to bind to <b>the</b> <b>protein.</b> However, there are some detergent-compatible Bradford reagents. The Bradford assay depends on the sequence of <b>the</b> <b>protein.</b> Thus, if <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> does not contain an ideal number of aromatic residues, then the dye {{will not be able}} to bind to <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> efficiently. Another disadvantage of <b>the</b> Bradford <b>Protein</b> Assay is that this method depends on comparing the absorbance of <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> to that of a standard <b>protein.</b> So if <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> does not react to the dye in a similar way as <b>the</b> standard <b>protein,</b> it is possible that the concentration is off.|$|R
5|$|Some {{people suffer}} from {{allergic}} reactions after handling onions. Symptoms can include contact dermatitis, intense itching, rhinoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, bronchial asthma, sweating, and anaphylaxis. Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions, possibly {{due to the}} denaturing of <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> from cooking.|$|E
5|$|A {{circular}} permutation is {{a relationship}} between proteins whereby <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> have a changed order of amino acids in their peptide sequence. The result is a protein structure with different connectivity, but overall similar three-dimensional (3D) shape. In 1979, the first pair of circularly permuted proteins – concanavalin A and lectin – were discovered; over 2000 such proteins are now known.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} changes can occur to {{mitochondria}} during the aging process. Tissues from elderly patients show {{a decrease in}} enzymatic activity of <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> of the respiratory chain. However, mutated mtDNA can only be found in about 0.2% of very old cells. Large deletions in the mitochondrial genome have been hypothesized to lead {{to high levels of}} oxidative stress and neuronal death in Parkinson's disease.|$|E
50|$|It holds two {{portions}} of <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> together, biasing <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> towards <b>the</b> folded topology. That is, the disulfide bond destabilizes the unfolded form of <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> by lowering its entropy.|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{we built}} a web {{database}} called PCoM-DB to make our data publicly accessible online. PCoM-DB shows users the migration profiles of <b>proteins</b> of interest. <b>The</b> <b>protein</b> migration profiles provide important information regarding <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> complexes. First, <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> migration profiles display the number and the estimated sizes of <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> complexes associated with a protein of interest. Second, they also provide a list of <b>the</b> co-migrated <b>proteins</b> whose protein migration profile peaks were overlapped with those of <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> of interest, or whose migration profiles {{were similar to those}} of <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> of interest. <b>The</b> co-migrating <b>proteins</b> with a protein of interest are potential interacting partners with <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> of interest. Different sources of biological information, such as gene expression data, protein domain information data, and mutant phenotypes, can be used for the further selection of the potential interacting partners.|$|R

5|$|Chlorine {{is usually}} used (in {{the form of}} hypochlorous acid) to kill {{bacteria}} and other microbes in drinking water supplies and public swimming pools. In most private swimming pools, chlorine itself is not used, but rather sodium hypochlorite, formed from chlorine and sodium hydroxide, or solid tablets of chlorinated isocyanurates. The drawback of using chlorine in swimming pools is that the chlorine reacts with <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> in human hair and skin (see Hypochlorous acid), and becomes chemically bonded. Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{undergo a}} range of posttranslational modifications, when additional chemical groups {{are attached to the}} amino acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic lipoproteins, or hydrophilic glycoproteins. These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid palmitic acid to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> to attach and then detach from cell membranes.|$|E
5|$|Modelling {{the disease}} in various types of animals, such as the {{transgenic}} mouse developed in 1996, enabled larger scale experiments. As these animals have faster metabolisms and much shorter lifespans than humans, results from experiments are received sooner, speeding research. The 1997 discovery that mHTT fragments misfold led {{to the discovery of}} the nuclear inclusions they cause. These advances have led to increasingly extensive research into <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> involved with the disease, potential drug treatments, care methods, and the gene itself.|$|E

5|$|Once {{growth and}} {{development}} are completed, vitamins remain essential nutrients for the healthy maintenance of the cells, tissues, and organs {{that make up a}} multicellular organism; they also enable a multicellular life form to efficiently use chemical energy provided by food it eats, and to help process <b>the</b> <b>proteins,</b> carbohydrates, and fats required for cellular respiration.|$|E
5|$|Phagocytes {{can also}} kill {{microbes}} by oxygen-independent methods, {{but these are}} not as effective as the oxygen-dependent ones. There are four main types. The first uses electrically charged proteins that damage the bacterium's membrane. The second type uses lysozymes; these enzymes break down the bacterial cell wall. The third type uses lactoferrins, which are present in neutrophil granules and remove essential iron from bacteria. The fourth type uses proteases and hydrolytic enzymes; these enzymes are used to digest <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> of destroyed bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphisms (normal variations) in {{particular}} genes {{have been linked}} with {{an increased risk of}} severe dengue complications. Examples include the genes coding for <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> known as TNFα, mannan-binding lectin, CTLA4, TGFβ, DC-SIGN, PLCE1, and particular forms of human leukocyte antigen from gene variations of HLA-B. A common genetic abnormality, especially in Africans, known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, appears to increase the risk. Polymorphisms in the genes for the vitamin D receptor and FcγR seem to offer protection against severe disease in secondary dengue infection.|$|E

50|$|Molecular {{analyses}} {{suggest that}} the causative mutations cause a truncation of <b>the</b> <b>protein.</b> These mutations result {{in the loss of}} PEST sequence in <b>the</b> <b>protein.</b> This loss is associated with a prolonged half life of <b>the</b> <b>protein.</b>|$|R
5|$|Since {{they were}} named, <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> {{have been found}} to be {{differentially}} expressed in other glands that secrete products directly into the external environment. These include lacrimal, parotid, submaxillary, sublingual, preputial and mammary glands. In some species, such as cats and pigs, Mups appear not to be expressed in urine at all and are mainly found in saliva. Sometimes the term urinary Mups (uMups) is used to distinguish those Mups expressed in urine from those in other tissues.|$|E
5|$|Surface gratings, {{consisting}} on ordered surface features due {{exposure of}} ordered muscle cells on cuts of meat. The structural coloration on meat cuts appears {{only after the}} ordered pattern of muscle fibrils is exposed and light is diffracted by <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> in the fibrils. The coloration or wavelength of the diffracted light depends on the angle of observation and can be enhanced by covering the meat with translucent foils. Roughening the surface or removing water content by drying causes the structure to collapse, thus, the structural coloration to disappear.|$|E

50|$|GST can {{be added}} to a protein of {{interest}} to purify it from solution in a process known as a pull-down assay. This is accomplished by inserting the GST DNA coding sequence next to that which codes for <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> of interest. Thus, after transcription and translation, <b>the</b> GST <b>protein</b> and <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> of interest will be expressed together as a fusion <b>protein.</b> Because <b>the</b> GST <b>protein</b> has a strong binding affinity for GSH, beads coated with the compound {{can be added}} to <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> mixture; as a result, <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> of interest attached to the GST will stick to the beads, isolating <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> from <b>the</b> rest of those in solution. The beads are recovered and washed with free GST to detach <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> of interest from the beads, resulting in a purified protein. This technique can be used to elucidate direct protein-protein interactions. A drawback of this assay is that <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> of interest is attached to GST, altering its native state.|$|R
5|$|The ER has {{a central}} role in producing, processing, and {{transporting}} biochemical compounds for use inside and outside of the cell. Its membrane is the site of production of all the transmembrane proteins and lipids for most of the cell's organelles, including the ER itself, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, endosomes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, secretory vesicles, and the plasma membrane. Furthermore, almost all of <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> that will exit the cell, plus those destined for the lumen of the ER, Golgi apparatus, or lysosomes, are originally delivered to the ER lumen. Consequently, many of <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> found in the cisternal space of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen are there only temporarily as they pass on their way to other locations. Other proteins, however, constantly remain in the lumen and are known as endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. These special proteins contain a specialized retention signal made up of a specific sequence of amino acids that enables them to be retained by the organelle. An example of an important endoplasmic reticulum resident protein is the chaperon protein known as BiP which identifies other proteins that have been improperly built or processed and keeps them from being sent to their final destinations.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe genome {{is around}} 2.9 billion base pairs in length {{compared}} to the 3.3 billion base pairs of the okapi. Of <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> in giraffe and okapi genes, 19.4% are identical. The two species are equally distantly related to cattle, suggesting the giraffe's unique characteristics are not because of faster evolution. The divergence of giraffe and okapi lineages dates to around 11.5 mya. A small group of regulatory genes in the giraffe appear {{to be responsible for}} the animal's stature and associated circulatory adaptations.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} types of vesicles each with a {{different}} protein configuration. Most are formed from specific regions of membranes. When a vesicle buds off from a membrane it contains specific proteins on its cytosolic surface. Each membrane a vesicle travels to contains a marker on its cytosolic surface. This marker corresponds with <b>the</b> <b>proteins</b> on the vesicle traveling to the membrane. Once the vesicle finds the membrane, they fuse.|$|E
50|$|All {{proteins}} are transcribed {{and produced}} from blueprints in the cell, called genes. Mosaic proteins {{can be made}} when two adjacent genes are transcribed together and are therefore made into <b>the</b> same <b>protein.</b> This can benefit <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> because it makes <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> more stable and gives <b>the</b> <b>protein</b> a more complex function.
