Some sources assert that the fuse was lit at around 1:00 pm, although the 19th-century local historian Heinrich Joseph Floß argued that these sources are mistaken, and that the explosion clearly occurred in the morning. All sources agree that the explosion, with a dreadful crack, propelled chunks of the towers and walls high into the air. Almost half the Godesburg collapsed instantly. According to a newspaper report dated 13 January 1584, debris raining on the valley below damaged several houses, and destroyed some of them completely.|$|E

5|$|On July 5, 2009, the G {{was once}} again {{extended}} south at all times to Church Avenue. This was required for overhaul of the Culver Viaduct, which caused the express tracks at Smith–Ninth Streets and Fourth Avenue/Ninth Street—used to switch G trains between tracks after they terminated at Smith–Ninth Streets—to be temporarily taken out of service. This had several benefits. First, five stations previously served by only the F train had more frequent service. Additionally, riders from northern Brooklyn and Long Island City had a direct route to Kensington. Finally, since the Church Avenue terminal had four tracks to store terminating G trains, as opposed to only one storage track at Smith–9th Streets, this reduced delays on both services because terminating G trains could switch to the storage tracks without having <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> station for another train to leave, as had occurred at Smith–Ninth Street. On July 19, 2012, MTA officials made this extension permanent because it provided more direct connections between Kensington and north Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|Wanting {{to reunite}} with Victoria, Victor tricks Emily into taking {{him back to}} the Land of the Living by pretending he wants her to meet his parents. She agrees to this and takes him to see Elder Gutknecht, the kindly ruler of the underworld, to return Victor and Emily {{temporarily}} to the Land of the Living. Once back home, Victor asks Emily <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forest while he rushes off to see Victoria and confess his wish to marry her as soon as possible, to which she gladly returns his feelings. Just as they are about to share a kiss, Emily arrives and sees the two of them together. Feeling betrayed and hurt, she angrily drags Victor back to the Land of the Dead. Victoria tells her parents that Victor has been forcibly wed to a dead woman, but no one believes her. With Victor gone, Victoria's parents decide to marry her off against her will to a presumed-wealthy newcomer in town named Lord Barkis Bittern, who appeared at the wedding rehearsal.|$|E

25|$|In the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), the {{strategic}} {{importance of the}} Trans-Siberian Railway was seen, though its shortcomings contributed to Russia's defeat in the war. The track was a single track and as such could only allow train travel in one direction. This caused significant strategic and supply difficulties for the Russians, as they could not move resources {{to and from the}} front as quickly as would be necessary, as a goods train carrying supplies, men and ammunition coming from west to east would have <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sidings, whilst troops and injured personnel in a troop train travelling from east to west went along the line. Thus the Japanese were quickly able to advance whilst the Russians were awaiting necessary troops and supplies.|$|E
25|$|The first {{proposals}} for a tramway to Singsaker was {{launched by the}} management of Trondhjems Elektricitetsværk og Sporvei in 1924. They proposed a route from the existing Elgeseter Line at Elgeseter Bridge via Singsaker and Rosenborg to Buran. It would have been built it in several stages, with the first terminus at Tyholtveien. The whole line was estimated to cost 1.175 million Norwegian krone (NOK). The board instead chose <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hopes that the price would be reduced. A new proposal in 1926 saw {{a change in the}} plans. Instead of following Høyskolealléen, Klæbuveien and Christian Fredriks gate, the line was chosen to just follow Klostergata and Eidsvolls gate. A bus route was also considered, but it would cost NOK96,000 more per year to operate than a tramway, thus making the whole project unprofitable. A trolleybus was also considered, but at the time there was no technical way to combine the overhead wires from both trams and trolleybuses on the same road.|$|E
3000|$|Correspondingly, NIRA {{parameters}} need to {{be explored}} when using different network sizes as well. As network size increases, potential destination PEs can be in a long distance from their source PEs, which adds significant communication delays. In such cases, it may be better <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> a blocking state until some slots of the destination PEs' queue become available, rather than sending data to an alternative PE that is far away; the delay penalty due to network-associated delays (i.e., router, crossbar, buffering), involved <b>in</b> sending <b>the</b> packet to the alternative PE, {{may be more than}} the delay penalty due <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> source PE until the original destination PE becomes eligible to accept new data.

30|$|To {{maximize}} traffic throughput, intersection {{management is}} the most important part because it is the place which causes the most congestion due <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> traffic signal and potential accidents. Many works attempts to mitigate traffic congestion by improving the effectiveness of traffic signaling. However, there are still independent factors that we cannot totally control and they have an influence on the overall traffic situation such as human driver and routing problem. Adaptive traffic signaling basically tries to optimize the period of red and green light, based on the real-time traffic data but the practical problem is that there is unbalanced demand in a network when most vehicles need to go <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same direction. Adaptive traffic signaling alone cannot handle such situation.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} stage of the Corps plan, the {{divisions}} were to occupy higher ground either side of Willow Stream and beyond Mametz on the right, then take Fricourt in the next stage, moving through the first German intermediate position, to the second intermediate position across the valley fronting Mametz Wood. The right was to gain contact with the XIII Corps at White Trench and the left link with III Corps, at Quadrangle Trench below Contalmaison. The final objective was chosen to receive a counter-attack, with good artillery observation in front of dead ground, from which the artillery could bombard the German second position. If the German defence collapsed, the 17th Division in corps reserve, would pass through and advance beyond Mametz Wood, up the north side of Caterpillar Valley, to Bazentin le Grand, Longueval and Ginchy. Fricourt was not to be attacked frontally but isolated, for which the right hand brigade of the 7th Division was to take Mametz and then White Trench, the centre brigade was to form a defensive flank on the south rise of Willow Valley, which faced Fricourt and Fricourt Wood to the north. The inner brigades of the 7th Division and 21st Division were <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front-line trenches opposite the village, until ordered forward by the corps commander.|$|E
