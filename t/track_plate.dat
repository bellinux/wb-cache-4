50|$|A <b>track</b> <b>plate</b> is kept at {{the bottom}} of the machine. Packages, which supply axial yarns, are kept beneath the <b>track</b> <b>plate.</b> Bobbins are mounted on the carrier, which is pushed by horn gears over the <b>track</b> <b>plate.</b> Braiding yarns are fed from these bobbins. The {{relative}} motion of the braiding yarns and the axial yarn determines the pattern and the structure of the braid.The 3D braiding process is a minor modification of 2D braiding process, where the standing ends are added to the braiding yarns that are moving. The most important 3D braiding techniques are discussed below.|$|E

50|$|In the two-step {{braiding}} process, the bobbins move continuously without stopping. They {{move on the}} <b>track</b> <b>plate</b> {{through the}} complete structure and around the standing ends, such that the movements of bobbins are faster {{when compared to the}} four-step braiding process. The bobbins can move only in two directions, so the process is called the two-step braiding process.|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{heterogeneity}} in risk is {{a critical}} component of predator-prey interactions. However, at small spatial scales, it is difficult to quantify predation risk without altering it. We used <b>track</b> <b>plates</b> to measure local predation risk created by white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) foraging activity on oak-forest plots in Millbrook, New York. Live gypsy moth pupae (Lymantria dispar) were placed at 2 heights on trees and monitored for predation. Pupae deployed on trees visited by mice {{were more likely to be}} eaten than those on trees not visited. Logistic regression indicated that predation rates on gypsy moth pupae were positively correlated with track activity, indicating that areas of concentrated mouse activity were areas of heightened risk for gypsy moths. Survival of individual oat grains placed on and 50 cm from <b>track</b> <b>plates</b> were not statistically different, indicating that mice exhibited no detectable behavioral reaction toward <b>track</b> <b>plates.</b> We conclude that <b>track</b> <b>plates</b> offer an economical and reliable means of quantifying local risk of attack by terrestrial mammals without substantially altering the spatial distribution of risk...|$|R

50|$|In a horn gear braider, bobbins {{of thread}} pass {{one another to}} the left and right on pseudo-sinusoidal tracks, a peg at their bases is driven by a series of so called horn gears. A horn gear {{consists}} of a notched disk driven by a spur gear below on the same shaft. These gears lie below the <b>track</b> <b>plate</b> that the bobbin carriers ride on, and an even number of gears must be used as there are always an even number of bobbins. The gears must be driven at multiple points on machines with two or more bobbin sets and cross-shafts are used.|$|E
5000|$|Tracks may be broadly {{categorized}} as [...] "live" [...] or [...] "dead" [...] track. [...] "Dead" [...] track {{is a simple}} design in which each <b>track</b> <b>plate</b> {{is connected to the}} rest with hinge-type pins. These dead tracks will lie flat if placed on the ground; the drive sprocket pulls the track around the wheels with no assistance from the track itself. [...] "Live" [...] track is slightly more complex, with each link connected to the next by a bushing which causes the track to bend slightly inward. A length of live track left on the ground will curl upward slightly at each end. Although the drive sprocket must still pull the track around the wheels, the track itself tends to bend inward, slightly assisting the sprocket and somewhat conforming to the wheels.|$|E
40|$|Natural History & EvolutionRodents {{perceive}} odors exuded by mammalian predators, and may alter foraging behaviors {{based on}} such information. The literature is mixed, however, {{and the extent to}} which wild rodents actually rely on olfaction to assess predation risk is not known. Aversion to predator scents may be innate or learned, and few studies have considered the potential importance of previous experience in determining rodent reactions to scent cues. We measured the effects of red fox (Vulpes vulpes) urine on the foraging activity of nocturnal rodents at <b>track</b> <b>plates</b> baited with sunflower seeds. To test the influence of previous experience, we set <b>track</b> <b>plates</b> both in areas close to human habitation (where rodents are presumably "predator naïve"), and in forest habitats where active predation by mammalian carnivores is likely. In both areas, a urine treatment and a scentless control were alternated in nightly trials. We discovered a significant difference between forest and residential populations of rodents in their response to red fox urine, though urine treatments did not differ from control treatments within either area. The difference in response to urine treatments was opposite of expected, with residential rodents significantly less active at urine‐treated <b>track</b> <b>plates</b> than forest rodents...|$|R
40|$|Accurate density {{estimates}} of rodents are frequently difficult or cost-prohibitive to determine. Thus, {{a number of}} techniques (<b>track</b> <b>plates,</b> monitoring blocks, chew cards/sticks, apple slice index, trapping) are often used to index rodent populations. Theoretically, the sensitivity of these indexing techniques could be improved if they applied continuous measurements rather than simple binary measurements (presence/absence). Development of a relative abundance technique that is simple to apply and sensitive to changes in population density is critical for the operational management of rodent pests. In addition to providing a quantitative measure of abundance with statistical parameters, an indexing technique that does not require handling of animals is important in consideration of potential disease issues (for example, hantavirus, arenavirus, etc.). We investigated <b>track</b> <b>plates,</b> chew cards and nx 3 ̆emtoring blocks and assodatedcontmuousn^asurement methods fwcalculatm laboratory and field settings, we tested their effectiveness in detecting different population densities of California meadow voles (Microtus cahfornicus).

50|$|To {{improve its}} trench {{crossing}} ability to 4.88 m the vehicle {{had a very}} elongated shape. The track length was 34 ft 2 in (10.42 m) but even though the hull width was an impressive nominal 3.76 m, the actual length-width ratio of the tracks was very poor as that width included the sponsons. Combined with wide tracks it proved difficult to turn the tank. During testing many tracks twisted and broke in a turn and {{it was decided to}} use longer, stronger 13.25 inch (337 mm) links made of hardened cast armour plate, stiffened by webs formed by recesses in the <b>track</b> <b>plate.</b> Another effect of the narrow hull was that the fighting compartment was also very narrow. This was made worse by the fact that now the gap between the double track frames at each side was very wide; earlier types had only the tracks themselves widened. Nevertheless the tank was supposed to accommodate another twenty infantry men in full gear if necessary. In absolute terms the vehicle was very large: at 10 ft 3 in (3.13 m) tall the Mark VIII was the second largest operational tank in history, after the Char 2C. However its weight was only 38.3 LT fitted for battle as the armour plate was thin with a thickness of 16 mm on the front and sides—a slight improvement over the Mark V but very thin by later standards. The roof and bottom of the hull were protected by only 6 mm thick armour plate, leaving the tank very vulnerable to mortar shells and landmines.|$|E

40|$|Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) {{living in}} urban environments are a {{critical}} {{public health and}} economic problem, particularly in urban slums where residents are at a higher risk for rat borne diseases, yet convenient methods to quantitatively assess population sizes are lacking. We evaluated track plates as a method to determine rat distribution and relative abundance in a complex urban slum environment by correlating the presence and intensity of rat-specific marks on track plates with findings from rat infestation surveys and trapping of rats to population exhaustion. To integrate the zero-inflated <b>track</b> <b>plate</b> data we developed a two-component mixture model with one binary and one censored continuous component. <b>Track</b> <b>plate</b> mark-intensity was highly correlated with signs of rodent infestation (all coefficients between 0. 61 and 0. 79 and all p-values < 0. 05). Moreover, the mean level of pre-trapping rat-mark intensity on plates {{was significantly associated with}} the number of rats captured subsequently (Odds ratio 1. 38; 95 % CI 1. 19 - 1. 61) and declined significantly following trapping (Odds ratio 0. 86; 95 % CI 0. 78 - 0. 95). Track plates provided robust proxy measurements of rat abundance and distribution and detected rat presence even when populations appeared 'trapped out'. Tracking plates are relatively easy and inexpensive methods {{that can be used to}} intensively sample settings such as urban slums, where traditional trapping or mark-recapture studies are impossible to implement, and therefore the results can inform and assess the impact of targeted urban rodent control campaigns...|$|E

Based on the general finite element software ABQUS, a vehicle-turnout-roadbed coupled dynamic model was built, and the dynamic properties of NO. 18 movable-point turnout were analyzed in this paper. The result shows that: the acceleration of switch rail and nose rail is larger than that of track in common section under foundation settlement; large vibration and deformation of the track structure arise when the vehicle is going through, meanwhile the peak of foundation lateral vibration response is higher than that of vibration caused by the vehicle passing switch rail. The derailment coefficient, rate of rail load reduction, the acceleration and displacement of <b>track</b> <b>plate</b> and foundation all increase with the {{settlement of}} foundation. On the contrary, they reduce as the length of subtense. Also, the dynamic response of high-speed turnout grows along with the speed of the increasing under foundation settlement...|$|E

40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of {{agricultural}} and urban development in California 2 ̆ 7 s Central Valley in the 20 th and 21 st centuries, many habitats, including riparian forests, have been drastically altered. Along with these habitats, species that are dependent on them have also been fragmented and their long-term survival threatened. The riparian brush rabbit (Sylvilagus bachmani riparius) is one such species that has experienced profound population contraction over the past century. This research was conducted at Caswell Memorial State Park (2 ̆ 2 the Park 2 ̆ 2), located in Ripon, California, which is the largest remaining habitat fragment within the rabbit 2 ̆ 7 s historical range.

30|$|Braiding {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{technique}} employed for the manufacture of fabrics and ropes. It is also commonly used to produce near-net shaped preforms for advanced fibre reinforced composites. This paper presents an explicit finite element approach to create and simulate the braiding process for the virtual manufacture of 2 D braids. The process starts from the definition of an analytical function which describes the movement of the carriers on a braiding <b>track</b> <b>plate.</b> Models of idealised Maypole-type braiding machines are built and used to shape virtual yarns into braids. This procedure can be used in a parameter control fashion, to optimise or to create virtual braided structures, which can serve as input for other structural analyses. It is emphasised that multiple cylinders are required for the modelling of a multifilament yarn to achieve better correlation with the experimental results. A parametric study is presented to investigate the effect of the number of virtual cylinders to represent a real yarn and the shape of the final braid. Excellent correlation was found between the virtual models and the experimental results when comparing the braid angle and yarn width.|$|E
40|$|High {{throughput}} {{production of}} DNA profiles {{has now become}} routine by coupling multiplex amplification of STR loci with automated fluorescence-based detection of the PCR products during electrophoresis. However, to maximise the efficiency of production {{it is necessary to}} consider the streamlining, and automation of sample and data handling at all stages of the DNA profiling process. This issue has been addressed within the UK National DNA Database Unit by developing a microtitre plate-based robotic process for the manipulation of samples prior to electrophoresis. Buccal scrapes submitted to the unit for analysis are entered into the system using a custom built sample logging station, and DNA extraction is subsequently performed in deep-well microtitre plates. Automated quantification, dilution and PCR set-up are undertaken by a fully integrated robotic system comprising a 9 channel pipetting station, an articulated robotic arm on a linear 3 metre <b>track,</b> <b>plate</b> hotels, and a fluorimeter for DNA quantification using a PicoGreen-based assay. Following amplification, the PCR products are aliquotted by a second pipetting station and then loaded into an automated DNA sequencer by multi-channel pipette. Sample tracking and all data flow throughout the process are controlled by system supervisory software integrated with a bespoke laboratory information management system. This approach, coupled with newly developed expert systems for analysis of the output data, enables very high throughput of samples to be achieved, together with a significant reduction in manpower requirements and processing costs...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences, 2007 The American marten (Martes americana) has {{experienced}} an apparent loss of occupied range {{over the last}} 75 years in northeastern California. Extinction selectivity, or relative vulnerability, is non-random and individual traits make some species more extinction-prone than others. Martens possess many life history traits that promote species risk including specialized habitat preference, restricted distribution, low fecundity and high trophic level. Studies conducted elsewhere in North America have shown martens are sensitive to forest fragmentation and to thresholds in landscape characteristics. I used field surveys and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to identify the landscape-scale habitat associations of martens and develop a model that predicts their occurrence. The study area included five national forests (Klamath, Shasta-Trinity, Lassen, Plumas, Tahoe) and Lassen Volcanic National Park. This region encompasses 27, 700 km 2 of largely mountainous terrain. Systematic surveys of forest carnivores were conducted by U. S. Forest Service personnel at 184 sample units using <b>track</b> <b>plate</b> stations and remotely-triggered cameras. Marten detections were clustered in three distinct areas, occurring at 10. 8 % of sample units. I investigated marten habitat selection using circular plots created at three spatial extents: 3, 20 and 80 km 2. An information-theoretic method was used to rank 89 a priori candidate models. Multivariate models were constructed using combinations of environmental variables hypothesized to be important to marten ecology and management. Predictor variables included elevation, stream density, land ownership, road density, nearby marten detections and landscape metrics of forest vegetation. Forests closely associated with marten reproduction, {{the most important aspect}} of their life history, were selectively chosen based on type, size class and canopy closure using the California Wildlife-Habitat Relationships (CWHR) system. I created a composite vegetation index (CVI) by combining these forests and used a spatial analysis program to compute composition and configuration metrics to quantify habitat heterogeneity. Resource selection functions were applied to predict marten occurrence. The model that best fit the data was assessed at the 80 km 2 spatial extent and included the predictor variables amount of habitat, number of habitat patches and land ownership category. These results provide support for the hypothesis that martens select habitat based upon broad scale landscape conditions. Descriptive statistics indicate marten detection sites had, on average, three times the amount of CVI-defined reproductive forests and interior forests (e. g., larger unfragmented forest stands) as non-detection sites. Late-successional forests located at higher elevations appear important for marten population persistence and maintenance of large forest patches may benefit marten. Trends in the distribution of marten in this region indicate proactive conservation actions are needed. This study may help address this need through development of a statistically valid model of marten habitat suitability, potentially useful for resource and conservation planning. U. S. D. A.

40|$|The {{impacts of}} roads on {{wildlife}} are extensive {{and can be}} especially harmful on U. S. National Forest lands where ecosystems are relatively intact. Access allowed by wildland roads can increase poaching, over-hunting, and over-trapping. Roads also increase negative edge effects, cause fragmentation, and facilitate or hinder wildlife movement. Forest Service managers are removing some roads to mitigate these impacts on wildlife, but few studies have addressed {{the effectiveness of this}} strategy. In this study, we tested if wildlife were using decommissioned roads more than adjacent open roads. The study was conducted on the Clearwater National Forest in the Bitterroot Mountains of north-central Idaho where they have removed and revegetated more than 500 mi of roads. From May to October 2006 we monitored wildlife use on open and decommissioned roads using remotely-triggered cameras and baited <b>track</b> <b>plates.</b> Wildlife monitoring {{was part of a larger}} citizen monitoring program where a trained volunteer coordinator lead trips into the field each week to collect data on decommissioned roads. Using t-tests, we compared the number of detections and rates of detection between open and decommissioned roads. Remotely-triggered cameras detected mammals at a higher rate on decommissioned roads than open roads for all species. However, on <b>track</b> <b>plates</b> there were about the same number of detections on open and decommissioned roads. Overall, we could not statistically distinguish the rate of detection between open and closed roads for white-tailed deer, elk, moose, and coyotes. Black bear, however, had a significantly higher rate of detection on removed roads than open roads (p<. 01). This finding is consistent with several studies that have found that bears avoid open roads. While the sample size was small, this study is the first to demonstrate with statistical significance that road decommissioning is restoring habitat for bears. This summer we will increase our sampling efforts to help reduce variability and test if the level of security influences rates of detection.
