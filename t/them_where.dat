5|$|Stephen {{set up a}} territory-based {{administrative}} system, establishing counties. Each county, {{headed by}} a royal official known as a count or ispán, was an administrative unit organized around a royal fortress. Most fortresses were earthworks in this period, but the castles at Esztergom, Székesfehérvár and Veszprém were built of stone. Forts serving as county seats also became the nuclei of Church organization. The settlements developing around <b>them,</b> <b>where</b> markets were held on each Sunday, were important local economic centers.|$|E
5|$|Displays are {{classified}} as deimatic or aposematic by {{the responses of the}} animals that see <b>them.</b> <b>Where</b> predators are initially startled but learn to eat the displaying prey, the display is classed as deimatic, and the prey is bluffing; where they continue to avoid the prey after tasting it, the display is taken as aposematic, meaning the prey is genuinely distasteful. However, these categories are not entirely mutually exclusive. It is possible for a behaviour to be both deimatic and aposematic, if it both startles a predator and indicates the presence of anti-predator adaptations.|$|E
