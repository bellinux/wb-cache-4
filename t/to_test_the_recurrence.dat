40|$|Abstract. We develop match {{probability}} statistics <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>the</b> <b>recurrences</b> of {{gamma ray}} bursts in the BATSE catalog 1 B and 2 B. We {{do not find}} a signal of repetitions at the match level of 10 − 3. Key words: Gamma ray bursts – Recurrences It is an interesting question whether classical gamma ray bursts repeat, especially {{because of the potential}} implication on the distance of the sources. Gamma ray bursts were first discovered [1] by Vela satellites in 1967 the same year the first radio pulsar was discovered. Pulsars are understood to be rotating neutron stars in essence, but the origin of gamma-ray bursts is a complete mystery. If they are from the (extended) Galactic halo, the isotropic emission energy will be ∼ 10 43 ergs. If they are from cosmological distances, the isotropic emission energy will be ∼ 10 51 ergs. For example, the bursts from cosmological distances can not be repetitive because the enormous energy output would most likely be accompanied by the consumption of the sources...|$|R

This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether the time to first recurrence of syncope after a positive isoproterenol–tilt table test result accurately predicts the eventual frequency of syncope. Background. Both patient care and future clinical trials involving patients with neuromediated syncope will require a simple measure that reflects the frequency of syncope. The time from tilt table <b>testing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first <b>recurrence</b> of syncope might be such a measure. Methods. A cohort of 46 patients with syncope, in a university outpatient clinic, who had at least one syncopal spell after a positive isoproterenol–tilt table test result were followed up for up to 6. 5 years (mean [±SD] 48 ± 14 months). The time from tilt table <b>testing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first <b>recurrence</b> of syncope was correlated. Results. A total of 40 of 46 patients had more than one recurrent spell, with a median of eight recurrent spells. The time to the first syncopal spell predicted the frequency of spells with r = − 0. 79 (p < 0. 001), whereas the time to the second spell predicted the frequency with r = − 0. 92 (p < 0. 001). Patients who fainted within 1 month of tilt testing had a geometric mean frequency of 1. 35 spells/month (95 % confidence limits 0. 49, 3. 74) compared with patients who fainted 1 to 24 months after testing (0. 12 spells/month; 95 % confidence limits 0. 07 to 0. 18, p < 0. 001). Finally, the frequency of syncopal spells bore no relation to the duration of follow-up. Conclusions. The time to the first recurrent spell predicts the frequency of syncopal spells after a positive tilt table <b>test</b> result, and <b>the</b> instantaneous risk of syncope is constant.

40|$|PURPOSE Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{the most}} common arrhythmia and has an increasing impact on public health because of its morbidity and mortality. Clinical and diagnostic <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> predict <b>the</b> <b>recurrence</b> of arrhythmia and clinical events before AF becomes permanent are still an open issue. METHODS 307 out of 1442 patients in sinus rhythm, at high risk of recurrence of AF enrolled in the GISSI-AF study, participated in a substudy with echocardiographic and biohumoral evaluation at baseline and at 12 -month follow-up. The relations between biomarker concentrations and echocardiographic parameters with study endpoints in 1 year, were analysed by a stepwise multivariable Cox model (entry criteria p[*]<[*] 0. 5 and stay criteria p[*]<[*] 0. 2). RESULTS The echocardiographic variables, cardiac markers and clinical variables considered in the statistical model indicated a higher concentration of NT-proBNP at baseline as the strongest factor related to time of first AF recurrence (HR 1. 42; 95 %CI 1. 23 - 1. 46), first CV hospitalization (HR 1. 58; 95 %CI 1. 31 - 1. 92) and increasing duration of recurrent AF (OR 2. 16; 95 %CI 1. 52 - 3. 08). Valsartan treatment was not related to clinical events. CONCLUSIONS In patients in sinus rhythm with a history of AF a higher concentration of NT-proBNP at baseline was the strongest independent risk factor for first AF recurrence and its duration, and for the first hospital admission for cardiovascular reasons...|$|R

We explored the factors associated with recurrence of OSCC and analyzed the survival of patients after recurrence. Clinicopathologic and follow-up data of 275 patients with OSCC treated by surgery in the Cancer Institute and Hospital of Tianjin Medical University between 2002 and 2006 were analyzed.
