5|$|This {{was because}} the {{situation}} began to change in favour of the Allies. They had landed in North Africa while <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> undertaking their great winter offensive, endangering, and eventually defeating, the German 6th Army around Stalingrad.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> {{designing}} and constructing increasingly sophisticated anti-ballistic missile defense systems to protect strategically important facilities around Moscow, reducing {{the threat posed}} by American ICBMs. These developments compelled the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, to commission a study to look into ways of improving the survivability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.|$|E

5|$|During {{the final}} game of the tournament, Canada and the Soviet Union became engaged in a violent bench-clearing brawl while Canada was leading 4–2.

5|$|In August 1936, Romania {{placed an}} order for 126; the bulk of these were {{delivered}} {{from the end of}} 1938 by Škoda. Afghanistan ordered ten in 1940; but, these were sold instead to Bulgaria. Total production was 434, including 298 for the Czechoslovak Army, 126 for Romania (under the designation Škoda R-2) and ten for Bulgaria. The Wehrmacht used 218 vehicles captured from the Czechoslovak Army in March 1939. Britain's Alvis-Staussler negotiated for a production license from September 1938 until March 1939 when the Nazi occupation made an agreement impossible. <b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> also interested so Škoda shipped the S-II-a prototype and one production LT vz. 35 to the proving grounds at Kubinka for evaluation. <b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> only interested in buying the prototype, but Škoda refused to sell unless a license was purchased as well, believing that the Soviets would simply copy the design and build it without paying any royalties.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} delays that {{affected}} {{the development and}} deployment of the CF-100 could also affect its successor, {{and the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> working on newer jet-powered bombers that would render the CF-100 ineffective, the RCAF began looking for a supersonic, missile-armed replacement for the Canuck even before it had entered service. In March 1952, the RCAF's Final Report of the All-Weather Interceptor Requirements Team was submitted to Avro Canada.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships were}} {{originally}} intended to be laid down 1 September 1939, but they were delayed until November to allow improvements to the shipyards to be completed. A total of sixteen ships were planned in the August 1939 building program, but this was scaled back to four in July 1940 and two in October 1940 {{when it became clear}} just how unprepared <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> for any large-scale naval construction program. Work on these ships ceased shortly after the German invasion.|$|E
5|$|Implementing the {{deception}} operation {{did not go}} through entirely without incident. Initially <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> {{kept in the dark}} about Egyptian intentions to go to war. Instead, on October 2, they were told that an Israeli raid was expected. Over the next two days the director of the Defense Intelligence Service, General Fouad Nassar, informed the Chief Soviet Liaison Officer, General Samakhodsky, that the raid was expected to be a large-scale attack, coupled with an air strike. Though Samakhodsky appeared at first to believe Nassar's story, it became clear to the Egyptians that <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> suspicious. In particular Soviet advisors serving with Egyptian and Syrian units were by October 3 reporting the unusually heightened activities of the Egyptian and Syrian forces. Both Sadat and Assad decided to inform the Soviets of their intention to go to war on October 3. Promptly, the Soviets requested permission to evacuate their personnel in Egypt, and both leaders reluctantly agreed. Egyptian commanders were taken completely by surprise, when, beginning late evening on October 4, Soviet experts serving with field units, embassy personnel and their families were hurriedly evacuated. By October 5, the evacuation was complete. This incident would be an important factor in convincing the Israelis that war was likely.|$|E
5|$|In September 1979, Khalqist President Nur Muhammad Taraki {{was assassinated}} in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member Hafizullah Amin, who assumed the presidency. Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces in December 1979. A Soviet-organized government, led by Parcham's Babrak Karmal but {{inclusive}} of both factions, filled the vacuum. Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government {{did not expect to}} do most of the fighting in Afghanistan. As a result, however, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> now directly involved in what had been a domestic war in Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the more}} {{significant}} impacts of containment was {{the outbreak of the}} Korean War. In June 1950, Kim Il-sung's North Korean People's Army invaded South Korea. Stalin approved and sent advisers to plan the North Korean invasion. To Stalin's surprise, the UN Security Council backed the defense of South Korea, though <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> then boycotting meetings in protest that Taiwan and not Communist China held a permanent seat on the Council. A UN force of personnel from South Korea, the United States, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Canada, Colombia, Australia, France, South Africa, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Belgium, New Zealand and other countries joined to stop the invasion.|$|E
5|$|After the Cournoyer goal, {{the goal}} judge refused {{to put the}} goal light on {{despite the fact that}} it was signalled a goal on the ice. In response, Alan Eagleson (seated across the ice from the Team Canada bench) {{attempted}} to reach the timer's bench to protest, causing a ruckus in the crowd as he made his way to the timer's bench. As he was being subdued by the Soviet police, the Canadian players headed over and Peter Mahovlich jumped over the boards to confront police with his stick. Eagleson was freed and the coaches escorted him across the ice to the bench. In anger, he shoved his fist to the Soviet crowd, as a few other Canadian supporters also gave the finger to the Soviets. The Soviets continued to play defensively. Sinden speculates <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> willing to accept the tie and win the series on goal differential.|$|E
5|$|Although the LVII Panzer Corps was reluctantly {{released}} to Army Group Don, by Army Group A, the 17th Panzer Division was ordered {{back to its}} original area of concentration, and did not prepare {{to go back to}} Army Group Don until 10 days after it had been asked for. In light of the troubles in building up sufficient forces, and seeing that <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> concentrating more mechanization on the Chir River, Manstein decided to launch Operation Winter Storm using the 4th Panzer Army. Manstein hoped that the 6th Army would launch an offensive of its own, from the opposite side, upon the receipt of the code signal Thunderclap. Manstein was gambling on Hitler accepting that the only plausible method to avoid the demise of the 6th Army was allowing it to break out, and assumed that General Paulus would agree to order his forces to escape the Stalingrad pocket. On 10 December, Manstein communicated to Paulus that the relief operation would commence in 24 hours.|$|E
5000|$|Another notable {{design that}} {{influenced}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Vickers A1E1 Independent, a large multi-turreted heavy tank built in 1925. Its design influenced <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> T-35 heavy tank.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, during the {{intervening}} {{period between the}} fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, MI5 combats <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> spies within <b>the</b> United Kingdom while facing their own agents' ineptitude, and the ridicule of the sheer fact that <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union <b>is</b> no longer a threat; but MI5 knows better and indeed <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>are</b> intent on making trouble.|$|R
5|$|By January 1944 <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> {{aware of}} {{successful}} British and American jet aircraft projects {{and that the}} Germans were about to deploy jet and rocket-propelled aircraft of their own. The GKO ordered on 18 February that the NKAP (People's Commissariat for Aviation Industry) centralize jet research under its control and that the NKAP was to present proposals to alleviate the situation within a month. As {{a result of this}} meeting the NKAP ordered the Lavochkin, Sukhoi, Yakovlev and Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureaux (OKBs) to develop and build jet aircraft with the utmost dispatch. Aware of earlier problems encountered with other novel propulsion systems such as ramjets both Sukhoi and Mikoyan-Gurevich chose to use the VRDK booster engine that had been under development since 1942.|$|E
5|$|During 1942, Allied {{officials}} debated on {{the appropriate}} grand strategy to pursue. All agreed that defeating Germany {{was the primary}} objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany through France. <b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> also demanding a second front. The British, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. Germany itself {{would be subject to}} a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large-scale armies. Eventually, the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} eighth and final game, each team had three wins and three losses and one tie, but <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> ahead in goal {{differential}} by two goals. In Canada, {{much of the}} country enjoyed an unofficial 'half a day' holiday, with many students in Toronto being sent home the afternoon of the game (which began at 1pm Eastern Time), while many others watched the game at work or school. In Montreal's Central Station, 5,000 fans gathered around ten TV sets to watch the game, which was simulcast in English on CBC Television and CTV, and in French by Radio-Canada. Until the men's hockey gold-medal game of the 2010 Winter Olympics, it was the most-watched sporting event in the history of Canadian television.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, Khrushchev {{was on the}} Southwest Front, and he and Timoshenko {{proposed}} a massive counteroffensive in the Kharkov area. Stalin approved {{only part of the}} plan, but 640,000Red Army soldiers would still become involved in the offensive. The Germans, however, had deduced that <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> likely to attack at Kharkov, and set a trap. Beginning on 12 May 1942, the Soviet offensive initially appeared successful, but within five days the Germans had driven deep into the Soviet flanks, and the Red Army troops were in danger of being cut off. Stalin refused to halt the offensive, and the Red Army divisions were soon encircled by the Germans. The USSR lost about 267,000soldiers, including more than 200,000men captured, and Stalin demoted Timoshenko and recalled Khrushchev to Moscow. While Stalin hinted at arresting and executing Khrushchev, he allowed the commissar to return to the front by sending him to Stalingrad.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1969, Chinese forces {{started the}} Sino–Soviet border conflict. The Sino–Soviet split had chagrined Premier Alexei Kosygin a great deal, {{and for a}} while he refused to accept its irrevocability; he briefly visited Beijing in 1969 due to the {{increase}} of tension between the USSR and China. By the early 1980s, both the Chinese and <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> issuing statements calling for a normalisation of relations between the two states. The conditions given to the Soviets by the Chinese were the reduction of Soviet military presence in the Sino–Soviet border and the withdrawal of Soviets troops in Afghanistan and the Mongolian People's Republic and to end their support for the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. Brezhnev responded in his March 1982 speech in Tashkent where he called for the normalisation of relations. Full Sino–Soviet normalisations of relations would prove to take years, until the last Soviet ruler, Mikhail Gorbachev came to power.|$|E
5|$|Missouri {{departed}} Istanbul on 9 April {{and entered}} Phaleron Bay, Piraeus, Greece, {{the following day}} for an overwhelming welcome by Greek government officials and anti-communist citizens. Greece had become {{the scene of a}} civil war between the communist World War II resistance movement and the returning Greek government-in-exile. The United States saw this as an important test case for its new doctrine of containment of the Soviet Union. <b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> also pushing for concessions in the Dodecanese {{to be included in the}} peace treaty with Italy and for access through the Dardanelles strait between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The voyage of Missouri to the eastern Mediterranean symbolized America's strategic commitment to the region.

50|$|Also, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> faction <b>is</b> {{superior}} {{in the early}} game and in land wars because of their very powerful and advanced tanks, while the Allied faction is better in the late game with more advanced units, such as those used in naval warfare.
