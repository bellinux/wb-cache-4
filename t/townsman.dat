25|$|O'Brien {{shared his}} primary {{education}} with a <b>townsman</b> {{with whom he}} was later to have a close political connection, Canon Sheehan of Doneraile. He enjoyed his secondary education at the Cloyne diocesan college, which resulted in his being brought up in an environment noted for its religious tolerance. He greatly valued having had this experience from an early age, which strongly influenced his later views for the need of such tolerance in Irish national life.|$|E

50|$|The town’s inner {{political}} organization was {{left up to}} the <b>townsmen.</b> Quickly, a ruling class of traders and craftsmen arose. New <b>townsmen</b> were always invested on St. Peter’s Day (22 January), and even unwed women {{had the right to}} become townswomen. Until 1555, <b>townsmen</b> were obliged yearly to pay the Bürgergewinnungsgeld (“townsman’s recovery tax”), which cost them each five Taler, roughly matching the price of a fat ox and a calf. To put this into perspective, a master mason earned roughly six Schilling a day, meaning that he had to work {{for three and a half}} days to earn a Taler. Alternatively it was also possible to pay a considerably lower inhabitant tax, but this brought with it no townsman’s rights. Many inhabitants chose this thriftier alternative. To be allowed to live within the town’s walls, it was a requirement for <b>townsmen</b> and other inhabitants alike to swear an oath of loyalty to the town of Schüttorf. Until 1719, all fully grown <b>townsmen</b> had the right to vote for town councillors, but thereafter only fully grown married men who were citizens were allowed to vote.|$|R
25|$|With the {{discontinuation}} of the Bel Air two-door sedan {{after the}} 1969 model year, all U.S.-market Bel Airs sold between 1970 and 1975 were four-door sedans or station wagons—the latter carrying the <b>Townsman</b> nameplate from 1969 to 1972 and Bel Air from 1973 to 1975. However, a Bel Air hardtop coupe—based on the Impala Sport Coupe body—was sold in Canada from 1970 to 1975. This body {{even had a}} roofline similar to the original '66-67 Caprice coupe style for 1974–1975.|$|E
25|$|Macropedius wrote several {{textbook}}s. The {{most famous}} of all was Epistolica, a textbook {{on the art of}} writing letters. It was published {{for the first time in}} Antwerp in 1543. It was also printed as Methodus de Conscribendis Epistolis in Basel, Cologne, Dilligen, Frankfurt am Main, 's-Hertogenbosch, and Leyde. The book was published in London in 1576, followed by ten reprints; the last one dates from 1649. Even William Shakespeare may have known it due to the reprint of the work by his friend, fellow <b>townsman</b> and printer, Richard Field. Evidently, the book was used at many schools in Western Europe for a long period of time.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the {{inhabitants}} of Bridgnorth were taking steps to improve their own protection. On 25 January the council agreed to maintain nine dragoons {{at the expense of}} the town, although the force was assembled only by renting a horse and rider from Thomas Corbet of Longnor Hall and two horses from Thomas Glover, a <b>townsman</b> who demanded a shilling a day for each animal. At the same time the watch was organised on more efficient military lines, with captains for day and night, and eight men assigned to the night watch, with six to the day. Corbet was persuaded to begin drilling the young men of the town and the surrounding area for its defence, although it was to Ottley he wrote on 5 February for support and validation.|$|E

500|$|The {{grandson}} of a non-royal <b>townsman</b> from a Theban {{family with a}} military background, Neferhotep I's relation to his predecessor Sobekhotep III is unclear {{and he may have}} usurped the throne. Neferhotep I was likely contemporaneous with kings Zimri-Lim of Mari and Hammurabi of Babylon. Little is known of his activities during his decade-long reign and the most important document surviving from his rule is a stela from Abydos recounting the fashion of an image of Osiris and Neferhotep's determination that it be made [...] "as instructed by the gods at the beginning of time".|$|E
500|$|Anderson and McGill {{temporarily}} {{relocated to}} London in 1937. There, Anderson found employment that she described as [...] "donkey work": she did research for a magazine named <b>Townsman,</b> {{and worked as}} a typist. Meanwhile, her husband, McGill, worked as a layout artist for Lever Brothers Agency, while continuing to paint in his spare time. While some critics have proffered this stint in England as evidence of the semi-autobiographical nature of Tirra Lirra by the River, Anderson rejected such claims, asserting that, while all of her characters had something of her in them, none were entirely autobiographical.|$|E

The Monmouth, commanded by fellow <b>townsman</b> James Alms, set sail to the East Indies in April 1781. Murray also took part in the Battle of Porto Praya against the Bailli de Suffren, and went on to face him again with Sir Edward Hughes's fleet off the coast of India at the Battle of Sadras on 15 February 1782, and at the Battle of Providien on 12 April 1782. Murray moved aboard Hughes's flagship, the 74-gun [...] shortly after the engagement at Providien, and went on {{to take part in the}} battles of Negapatam and Trincomalee, being wounded in the latter.|$|E

[...] Stevenson lost heavily outside the Solid South; he carried only nine states and lost the Electoral College vote 442 to 89. In his concession speech on election night, Stevenson said: [...] "Someone asked me...how I felt, and I was reminded of a story that a fellow <b>townsman</b> of ours used to tell – Abraham Lincoln.

50|$|In medieval rabbinic literature, {{there were}} efforts {{to justify the}} killing, not merely of Shechem and Hamor, but of all the <b>townsmen.</b> Maimonides argued that the killing was {{understandable}} because the <b>townsmen</b> had failed to uphold the seventh Noachide law (denim) to establish a criminal justice system. However, Nachmanides disagreed, partly because he viewed the seventh law as a positive commandment that was not punishable by death. Instead, Nachmanides said that the <b>townsmen</b> presumably violated other Noachide laws, such as idolatry or sexual immorality. Later, the Maharal reframed the issue—not as sin, {{but rather as a}} war. That is, he argued that Simeon and Levi acted lawfully insofar as they carried out a military operation as an act of vengeance or retribution for the rape of Dinah.|$|R
