5000|$|Samudrala's {{research}} has focused on understanding how the genome of an organism specifies its behaviour and characteristics, and applying that information to improve health and quality of life. His vision is to produce a computing model of life focused on atomic level detail, organisation, and arrangements of all the components involved, which he calls the [...] "structeome". The structeome, which is the actual structural organization of components at the atomic level, by its very nature includes single molecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites, as well larger groupings such genomes, proteome, interactomes, connectomes, and so on. Since the vision is of a large collection of atoms with subgroupings of atoms that work together in a complex dynamic manner, a protein would be a collection of atoms, many of which are covalently bonded, that interact together to perform a specific biological function. Samudrala's work has thus focussed on proteins, which is the fundamental unit of biological function within the structeome. Atoms in a structeome interact with the environment which may include other structeomes (or components thereof) thereby causing a strange loop or a <b>tangled</b> <b>hierarchy</b> of interactions. Thus a structeome would include not only all atoms and their interactions within that structeome, but also all interactions to other structeomes. Samudrala has extended this theoretical framework to explain how evolution works by recursion of existing information and has used it to solve research problems with practical applications in medicine, such as therapeutic discovery based on docking with dynamics, [...] multitargeting, and drug repurposing in a shotgun manner, as well as in nanobiotechnology, such as engineering tooth tissue by designing novel peptides that bind to various inorganic substrates.|$|E
40|$|Rationality" is {{understood}} in the empirical sense of cognitive abilities of human brains for solving economic problems, and consequently recognized bounded in individually unequal ways. This is shown to require treating it as a unique scarce resource, used for deciding on its own uses. This uniqueness disturbs axiomatic economics by a <b>tangled</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> and implies that rationality-allocation can approach efficiency only {{by means of an}} institutionally shaped trial-and-error evolution. Applied to the markets vs. government issue, a comparative institutional analysis of rationality-allocation yields novel insights with non-standard policy implications, and thus demonstrates that rationality-allocation matters. ...|$|E

Their study developed out {{of earlier}} studies of cybernetic, catastrophic, and chaotic systems. Complexity analysis stresses interactions among dispersed agents without a global controller, <b>tangled</b> <b>hierarchies,</b> adaptive learning, evolution, and novelty, and out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Complexity methods include interacting particle systems, self-organized criticality, and evolutionary game theory, to simulate artificial stock markets and other phenomena. Theoretically, bounded rationality replaces rational expectations. Complexity theory influences empirical methods and restructures policy debates. ...|$|R

The {{problem is to}} be able to design a "multidimensional portfolio", in order to organize and to index the different aspects of knowledge in an enterprise. We have chosen an object-oriented view for such a representation. Every piece of knowledge is represented within classes in an object-based representation system. The multidimensional organization is supported by a number of <b>tangled</b> <b>hierarchies</b> of classes, one hierarchy giving a particular point of view on the enterprise knowledge...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between nation-states, European citizenship, and transnationalism is analyzed on a theoretical level from {{a perspective that}} combines new institutionalism and complexity studies. In doing so the paper attempts to broaden the range of models that social scientists utilize to think about European citizenship. The launching of European identity, multiculturalism, of the advance of the transnationalist agenda further entangle a potentially conflictive situation {{without being able to}} reflect on their basic assumptions. Concepts such as <b>tangled</b> <b>hierarchies</b> and self-organization are invoked to expose how European identity and citizenship could relate to nation-states, as well as to argue in favor of subsidiary and national citizenship...|$|R
40|$|Self-awareness {{is a much}} {{discussed}} {{property of}} autonomic and self-managed networks. Attempting to demystify this property we show {{that it can be}} captured by a Self Awareness Function (SAF) that stems from the assessment of process correctness of autonomic and cognitive networks. Based on multiple position papers that were written in isolation we are able to identify various SAFs (for trust, security, dynamics control, service deployment), as well as associated research issues (information modelling, higher contextualisation, convergence, etc.). We show that multiple issues of self-management that create a <b>tangled</b> <b>hierarchy</b> of control loops can be systematically addressed with SAF in mind...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose that}} computer-support for {{collaborative}} design requires a shared {{understanding of the}} design artifact among a design team. The development and support for this shared understanding builds on currentdevelopments and research in AI, CAD, CSCW and computational models of design. The shared understanding should be an explicit representation {{in order to be}} effectively shared. The explicit representation shouldcomprise both a visual representation and a semantic model. In this paper we present an architecture for computer-supported collaborative design that distinguishes between a shared visual representation and a sharedunderlying representation. The development of the underlying representation combines graphical and semantic objects than can be abstracted and aggregated as a <b>tangled</b> <b>hierarchy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Though any {{phenomenon}} (in Pierce's sense) can {{be called}} an 'event', the usual meaning is rather a noteworthy occurrence; but 'noteworthy ' depends on the context where it is observed: in which system? through which viewpoint and timescale? Complex event processing is generally studied in a social system (e. g., a large enterprise, a society, a nation, …), a biological system (a cell, an organism,…) or a cognitive system. Such a system is evolutionary, with a <b>tangled</b> <b>hierarchy</b> of components of various complexity levels, self-organized thanks to a multiplicity of mutually entailed functional regulatory subsystems, each operating at its own rhythm; an event corresponds to a sudden detection of an expected or unexpected change of state, either by one of them or by an external observer. Here we analyze complex events {{in the frame of}} our theory of Memory Evolutive Systems (MES) developed for modeling this kind of systems, and based on a 'dynamic ' category theory integrating multiple temporalities (cf. our book EV, 2007) ...|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} five years, the European Union {{has been trying to}} sponsor a coming of age of European Identity {{awareness}} across national borders. In doing so, EU administration intends to square the circle of European Union as the super nation-state of the nation states of Europe. However prompted or justified by the political or economic context, it is noteworthy to what extent the texts of European statutes and policies lack theoretical alternatives to the territorial and relatively homogeneous state. In order for it not to become a threat perceived by the population in identity terms, the apparently forthcoming idea of European citizenship needs to address the concerns of both traditional and new ethnonational minorities at the state level and underneath. In the light of a global context, the tide of Europeanization is but a particular case of the worldwide extended tension between the two increasing and opposing processes of globalization and particularization. Drawing on methodological and theoretical considerations I explore the conflictive and <b>tangled</b> <b>hierarchies</b> of identity and citizenship. Finally, in regard to the problem of how diverse cultures and identities could relate to the universal idea of democratic citizenship, a proposal that attempts to mediate multiculturalism and Eurocentrism will be drafted...|$|R
40|$|Metacognition {{is usually}} {{construed}} as a conscious, intentional process whereby people reflect upon their own mental activity. Here, we instead suggest that metacognition is but an instance of a larger class of representational re-description processes that we assume occur unconsciously and automatically. From this perspective, the brain continuously and unconsciously learns to anticipate the consequences of action or activity on itself, on the world and on other people through three predictive loops: an inner loop, a perception-action loop and a self-other (social cognition) loop, which together form a <b>tangled</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> We ask what kinds of mechanisms may subtend this form of enactive metacognition. We extend previous neural network simulations and compare the model with signal detection theory, highlighting that while the latter approach assumes that both type I (objective) and type II (subjective, metacognition-based) decisions tap into the same signal at different hierarchical levels, our approach is closer to dual-route models {{in which it is}} assumed that the re-descriptions made possible by the emergence of meta-representations occur independently and outside of the firstorder causal chain. We close by reviewing relevant neurological evidence for the idea that awareness, self-awareness and social cognition involve the same mechanisms. © 2012 The Royal Society.

40|$|Multilingual {{parallel}} corpora can be annotated with monolingual tools, such as morphosyntactic taggers. However, even taggers for typologically similar languages use incompatible tagsets, {{which results}} in a conceptual and formal variety of tags. Retraining taggers on data annotated with a common tagset is not a realistic option. However, differences between tagsets are often rooted in different linguistic perspectives rather than in real distinctions between the languages, which means a common ground could be found. Moreover, a different perspective may provide additional information missing in one tagset but present in another. Our first goal is to delegate the task of dealing with multiple tagsets to an abstract interlingual representation of linguistic categories. Ideally, each tag in every language-specific tagset used in the corpus is linked to a position in a <b>tangled</b> <b>hierarchy</b> of concepts. To accommodate the different perspectives, the hierarchy takes three views of word class: inflectional, syntactic, and semantic (lexical), each with its appropriate morphological characteristics. Mismatches between tags are properly represented, which allows for a principled mapping strategy between languages-specific tagsets, and for intuitive and underspecified queries. The hierarchy can be built and the mismatches partially resolved using Formal Concept Analysis. Our second goal is to refine existing morphosyntactic annotation by projecting distinctions in one tagset onto a conceptually different tagset. The hierarchy and automatic word-toword alignment is used to learn from tags in another language. We show results of an experiment aimed at discovering how feasible this approach is for Czech and two other languages (English and Polish) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a methodology, a representation, and an implemented program for troubleshooting digital circuit boards {{at roughly the}} level of expertise one might expect in a human novice. Existing methods for model-based troubleshooting have not scaled up to deal with complex circuits, in part because traditional circuit models do not explicitly represent aspects of the device that troubleshooters would consider important. For complex devices {{the model of the}} target device should be constructed with the goal of troubleshooting explicitly in mind. Given that methodology, the principal contributions of the thesis are ways of representing complex circuits to help make troubleshooting feasible. Temporally coarse behavior descriptions are a particularly powerful simplification. Instantiating this idea for the circuit domain produces a vocabulary for describing digital signals. The vocabulary has a level of temporal detail sufficient to make useful predictions abut the response of the circuit while it remains coarse enough to make those predictions computationally tractable. Other contributions are principles for using these representations. Although not embodied in a program, these principles are sufficiently concrete that models can be constructed manually from existing circuit descriptions such as schematics, part specifications, and state diagrams. One such principle is that if there are components with particularly likely failure modes or failure modes in which their behavior is drastically simplified, this knowledge should be incorporated into the model. Further contributions include the solution of technical problems resulting from the use of explicit temporal representations and design descriptions with <b>tangled</b> <b>hierarchies...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Tease Apart Inheritance {{refactoring}} is used {{to avoid}} <b>tangled</b> inheritance <b>hierarchies</b> that lead to code duplication. This big refactoring creates two parallel hierarchies and use delegation to invoke one from the other. One of the drawbacks {{of this approach is}} that the root class of the new refactored hierarchy should be general enough to provide all its services. This weakness commonly leads to meaningless interfaces that violate the Liskov substitution principle. This paper describes a behavioral design pattern that allows modularization of different responsibilities in separate hierarchies that collaborate to achieve a common goal. It allows using the specific interface of each class in the parallel hierarchy, without imposing a meaningless interface to its root class. The proposed design is type safe, meaning that the compile-time type checking ensures that no type error will be produced at runtime, avoiding the use of dynamic type checking and reflection...|$|R
