5|$|In May 2000, Vagrant Story was {{the fifth}} best-selling PlayStation title of the month. 100,000 units were sold in the first 20 days of the game's release, despite being overshadowed by other Square <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> Final Fantasy IX and Chrono Cross. Vagrant Story was the third of twenty games to date, and the only game on the PlayStation, to receive a perfect score of 40 from Famitsu magazine.|$|E
5|$|In early 2010, fifteen {{weeks into}} the {{development}} of Monaco, the game won the 2010 GDC Independent Games Festival Seumas McNally Grand Prize award, {{as well as the}} Excellence in Design award. Monaco won Destructoids Best of 2013 Co-op Multiplayer award beating <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> Diablo III, Guacamelee!, and Payday 2. Monaco was also a finalist in the 2010 Indie Game Challenge under the Professional category.|$|E
5|$|The Search for Spock was {{released}} on home video in 1985. The initial retail offerings included VHS, Betamax, LaserDisc and CED formats with closed captioning. As {{part of a plan}} to support its push of 8mm video cassette, Sony partnered with Paramount Home Video to bring <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> The Search for Spock to the platform in 1986.|$|E

50|$|The book's <b>title,</b> <b>like</b> Clark's {{previous}} book's title, is a pun on {{the title}} of an Ernest Hemingway novel - in this case, The Sun Also Rises.|$|R

5|$|In June 2010, Anurag Basu {{confirmed}} that his film would feature three lead roles, a deaf and mute man, a mentally challenged girl, and a narrator. With former <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> Khamoshi or Silence, media reports said {{the story was}} grim or dark. However, Basu stated that on the contrary, the film was happy. According to Basu, he paid homage to Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin by adding scenes inspired by the era of silent cinema and using physical comedy in the film, involving silent portions.|$|E
5|$|This {{golden age}} {{was not to}} last. The years 1905–1908 saw half a million new Jewish {{immigrants}} to New York, and once again the largest audience for Yiddish theater was for lighter fare. Adler hung on, but the Thomashefskys were making a fortune at the Thalia; plays with <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> Minke the Servant Girl were far outdrawing fare like Gordin's Dementia Americana (1909). It would be 1911 before Adler scored another major success, this time with Tolstoy's The Living Corpse (also known as Redemption), translated into Yiddish by Leon Kobrin.|$|E
5|$|Uematsu joined Square in 1985, and {{composed}} the soundtrack to Cruise Chaser Blassty in 1986, his first. While working at Square, he met Hironobu Sakaguchi, who {{asked him if}} he wanted to create music for some of his games, which Uematsu agreed to. For the next year, he created music for a number of games which did not achieve widespread success, including <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> Genesis and Alpha. In 1987, Uematsu and Sakaguchi collaborated on what was originally to be Sakaguchi's last contribution for Square, Final Fantasy, a game {{that turned out to be}} a huge success.|$|E

5000|$|The {{game was}} universally panned by reviewers. IGN {{gave it a}} 1.4/10 stating sarcastically that it's [...] "really just a fantastic <b>title</b> <b>like</b> Ninjabread Man and Anubis II; {{everyone}} should experience Trixie in Toyland just as everyone should experience throat cancer." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bob Mortimer and Lisa Clark {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} Tittybangbang and involved Jill Parker. Mortimer {{came up with the}} show's name, wanting [...] "a really memorable <b>title</b> <b>like</b> Desperate Housewives", Clark said in an interview, [...] "it's rude, but in a comedy way".|$|R
5|$|The {{process of}} thought behind the Compilation would later inspire the {{creation}} of Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, a subseries of games linked by a common mythos, and would use {{lessons learned from the}} Compilation production process. On an individual level, Before Crisiss popularity would inspire {{the creation of}} another mobile title within the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries: originally titled Final Fantasy Agito XIII, it would later change platforms and be renamed Final Fantasy Type-0. The battle sequences in Advent Children also served as inspiration for Motomu Toriyama when creating the battle system for Final Fantasy XIII. Former staff members have blamed the Compilation, in conjunction with other extensions of <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> Final Fantasy X, for undermining the series' market presence and fan trust in the West.|$|E
5|$|Although issue #7 sold out, Image Comics PR & Marketing Director Jennifer deGuzman {{announced}} in a December 12, 2012 letter to retailers {{that it would}} not reprint select comics, such as that issue. DeGuzman explained the move as a result of decreasing orders on well-performing <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> Saga, despite critical acclaim and consistently selling out at a distributor level, and pointed to orders on Saga #8, which decreased 4% from orders on issue #7. Rather than invest in second printings, deGuzman explained, Image would instead focus its attention on ensuring that the first printing garners the sales desired. This move displeased some retailers, which prompted Image Publisher Eric Stephenson to announce the following day that Image would indeed publish a second printing of issue #7 at a considerable discount, but cautioned that the publisher {{would not be able to}} reprint every issue of the series indefinitely, and implored retailers not to under-order the series.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, {{following}} {{the success of}} their isometric Filmation game engine behind <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> Knight Lore, the Stampers founded a separate company: Rare Designs of the Future, later shortened to Rare. While Ultimate was built for the British home microcomputer market, Rare was founded with an eye toward the burgeoning Japanese video game console market, having been apprised of Nintendo by their Japanese arcade industry contacts. Nintendo initially rebuffed the brothers' interest in 1983, which led Chris Stamper to study the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) hardware for six months. The brothers flew to Kyoto to present software samples to Nintendo executives. Nintendo purchased the Stampers' Slalom, which sold half a million units, and made the Stampers into Nintendo's first Western third-party developer. As interest in Filmation and the Spectrum began to wane, the brothers sold part of Ultimate to U.S. Gold and began to focus on Rare, though the Stampers retained a majority stake in Ultimate.|$|E
5000|$|... 20 Years After is a 2008 American post-apocalyptic film. Filmed principally {{in north}} Alabama and {{southern}} Tennessee, the low-budget film was initially released under the <b>title</b> <b>Like</b> Moles, Like Rats, {{a reference to}} the Thornton Wilder play The Skin of Our Teeth.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>title,</b> <b>like</b> {{the game}} books that {{followed}} in the Fighting Fantasy series, distinguished itself by featuring a fantasy role-playing element, with the caption on each cover claiming each title was [...] "a Fighting Fantasy gamebook in which YOU become the hero!" ...|$|R

5|$|La Rose and La Marguerite are rival {{societies}} that commemorate the Anglo-French {{heritage of the}} island; the factions represent the warring colonial powers, between whose hands Saint Lucia changed fourteen times. La Rose is held on August 30 while La Margurite is held on October 17. The societies {{date back to the}} early 19th century, when each village was home to competing organizations of the Roman Catholic Church. Both societies draw on English royalty traditions and have a number of positions, including the King, Queen, Prince, Princess and various lower <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> the Chief of Police and nurse. La Rose and La Marguerite meet once weekly except during Lent. At these meetings, which are on Saturday for La Rose and Sunday for La Marguerite, members sing or play instruments and dance. La Marguerite meetings feature the membership in a seat chorus with a leader, the chantwèl, standing, while La Rose meetings include instruments like the tanbouwen (tambourine), baha (wooden trumpet), chakchak (rattles), guitar and gwaj (scraper).|$|E
5|$|On {{the final}} {{weekend of the}} 2007–08 season, Del Piero scored a brace against Sampdoria in a 3–3 draw. These two goals were crucial, as it took him to 21 goals for the season, thus winning him the Capocannonieri prize in Serie A {{for the first time}} in his illustrious career, beating the likes of {{teammate}} David Trezeguet (20 goals) and Marco Borriello (19 goals), also matching his highest seasonal tally in Serie A since the 1997–98 season. He became only the second Italian ever to win consecutive Capocannoniere titles in two different leagues – former Juventus and 1982 World Cup hero Paolo Rossi being the other. (Coincidentally, Rossi also won the Capocannoniere <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> Del Piero – first in Serie B and then in Serie A). On 26 July, Del Piero was awarded the Scirea Award. Juventus finished the 2007–08 Serie A season in third place, which allowed them to qualify for the UEFA Champions League the following season.|$|E
5|$|The series {{affected}} Square's {{business on}} several levels. The commercial failure of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within resulted in hesitation and delays from Enix during merger discussions with Square. Square's decision to produce games {{exclusively for the}} Sony PlayStation—a move followed by Enix's decision with the Dragon Quest series—severed their relationship with Nintendo. Final Fantasy games were absent from Nintendo consoles, specifically the Nintendo 64, for seven years. Critics attribute the switch of strong third-party <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest games to Sony's PlayStation, {{and away from the}} Nintendo 64, as one of the reasons behind PlayStation being the more successful of the two consoles. The release of the Nintendo GameCube, which used optical disc media, in 2001 caught the attention of Square. To produce games for the system, Square created the shell company The Game Designers Studio and released Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, which spawned its own metaseries within the main franchise. Final FantasyXIs lack of an online method of subscription cancellation prompted the creation of legislation in Illinois that requires internet gaming services to provide such a method to the state's residents.|$|E
50|$|The {{title of}} the episode “Smiles of a Summer Night”, comes from the film of the same <b>title.</b> <b>Like</b> almost all the other episode titles, this one has a {{connection}} to Stephen Sondheim as his musical A Little Night Music {{is based on the}} film.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "pastor" [...] means [...] "shepherd" [...] {{and is used}} {{several times}} in the New Testament to refer to church workers. Many Protestants use the term as a prenominal title (e.g., Pastor Smith) or as a job <b>title</b> (<b>like</b> Senior Pastor or Worship Pastor).|$|R

5|$|Challenges for the {{localization}} teams include space limitation (due to {{data storage}} and/or on-screen space), achieving a natural dialogue flow despite multiple plot branches and script lines being stored out of order, and, when voiced footage is not re-recorded for lip movement, dealing with file length and lip-synch limitations. When {{the same team}} works on different games in a series such as Final Fantasy, they often need to adopt different writing styles depending on the setting of their games. Another point to consider is humorous elements that do not translate properly into English, and different cultural expectations about character interactions. The localization process depends on {{factors such as the}} development teams' wishes, as well as budget and schedule. Traditionally, translation usually started late in development or after the original Japanese release, but recent titles have been translated during initial development, making the translators appear more like additional planners or consultants and not just translators-this was the case for Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XIV and Final Fantasy XV. A few <b>titles,</b> <b>like</b> The Bouncer, have actually been recorded in English first and then adapted to Japanese. The Last Remnant also adopted this approach, featuring motion-capture and dialogue synched to English rather than Japanese actors. This was done due to the company's wish to create a title for the international market.|$|E

50|$|Maya {{came up with}} game {{while sitting}} around with an {{animator}} friend. Together {{they thought it would}} be cool to have this video game with Michael Douglas catching pussycats in his mouth. The video game is old school 80s style, taking a nod to the early <b>title</b> <b>like</b> Space Invaders.|$|R
25|$|Apart from {{personal}} names, commons nouns expressing rank or relation {{may also be}} capitalized in addresses for reasons of politeness. suffixes and <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> Doctor, Junior, Senior, and their abbreviations are only capitalized {{if they are in}} a prominent position (e.g. in postal addresses or lists).|$|E
25|$|In 1974 the burghs {{became part}} of larger districts and regions. Those {{boundaries}} lost the significance they were granted by Royal statute.
