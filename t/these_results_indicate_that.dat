5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows {{significant}} correlation between hair length and age, which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, <b>these</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> hair length and quality {{can act as a}} cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair length and marital status, or number of children, was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age.|$|E

No absorption features were detected in the range covered by observations, 0.4–3.5μm. Thus previous reports of hydrated minerals and organic compounds {{on the surface of}} Lutetia have been disproven. The surface also does not contain any olivine.

25|$|For bicalutamide, the antiandrogenic {{activities}} of sulfide and sulfone substitions of the X-linkage {{were tested in}} vitro. The sulfides showed in most cases at least 2-fold higher binding affinity than corresponding sulfones. However, this relationship was reversed when the R3 group was NHSO2CH3, where the binding affinity of sulfone was 3-fold {{higher than that of}} sulfide. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> substituents of the B-ring largely determine the effect of the X-linkage in AR binding. Researchers have proposed that the tertiary hydroxyl group is involved in direct interaction with AR because when an acetyl group is introduced to that hydroxyl moiety, the receptor binding affinity greatly decreases.|$|E
25|$|A {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} study found that a single low dose of 10mg clomipramine to healthy volunteers resulted in 81.1% occupancy of the SERT, which was comparable to the 84.9% SERT occupancy by 50mg fluvoxamine. In the study, single doses of 5 to 50mg clomipramine resulted in 67.2 to 94.0% SERT occupancy while single doses of 12.5 to 50mg fluvoxamine resulted in 28.4 to 84.9% SERT occupancy. Chronic treatment with higher doses was able to achieve up to 100.0% SERT occupancy with clomipramine and up to 93.6% SERT occupancy with fluvoxamine. Other studies have found 83% SERT occupancy with 20mg/day paroxetine and 77% SERT occupancy with 20mg/day citalopram. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> very low doses of clomipramine are able to substantially occupy the SERT and that clomipramine achieves higher occupancy of the SERT than SSRIs at comparable doses. Moreover, clomipramine {{may be able to}} achieve more complete occupancy of the SERT at high doses, at least relative to fluvoxamine.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, S Heim et al. {{was one of}} {{the first}} studies not to just compare {{dyslexic}}s with a non dyslexic control, but to go further and compare the different cognitive sub groups with a non dyslexic control group. Different theories conceptualise dyslexia as either a phonological, attentional, auditory, magnocellular, or automatisation deficit. Such heterogeneity suggests the existence of yet unrecognised subtypes of dyslexics suffering from distinguishable deficits. The purpose of the study was to identify cognitive subtypes of dyslexia. Out of 642 children screened for reading ability 49 dyslexics and 48 controls were tested for phonological awareness, auditory discrimination, motion detection, visual attention, and rhythm imitation. A combined cluster and discriminant analysis approach revealed three clusters of dyslexics with different cognitive deficits. Compared to reading-unimpaired children cluster no. 1 had worse phonological awareness; cluster no. 2 had higher attentional costs; cluster no. 3 performed worse in the phonological, auditory, and magnocellular tasks. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> dyslexia may result from distinct cognitive impairments. As a consequence, prevention and remediation programmes should be specifically targeted for the individual child's deficit pattern.|$|E
2500|$|Pareidolia {{can cause}} people to {{interpret}} random images, or patterns of light and shadow, as faces. A 2009 magnetoencephalography study found that objects perceived as faces evoke an early (165 ms) activation of the fusiform face area {{at a time and}} location similar to that evoked by faces, whereas other common objects do not evoke such activation. This activation is similar to a slightly faster time (130 ms) that is seen for images of real faces. The authors suggest that face perception evoked by face-like objects is a relatively early process, and not a late cognitive reinterpretation phenomenon. [...] A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in 2011 similarly showed that repeated presentation of novel visual shapes that were interpreted as meaningful led to decreased fMRI responses for real objects. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli depends upon processes similar to those elicited by known objects.|$|E
2500|$|Tissue {{residue of}} metals in {{invertebrate}} prey organisms may reduce uncertainty in estimating exposure from multiple routes. This {{may be especially}} important in early life stages of an organism or for species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). However, {{it is challenging to}} develop a suitable approach to assessing metal toxicity through tissue residue because water quality can have a large influence on metal toxicity. With the exception of organometallic compounds, no generalized approaches have been created for analyzing metals in tissue residue, although site-specific and species-specific approaches have been successfully developed and used, especially for invertebrates. A recent paper examined tissue-residue toxicity for copper and cadmium in fish and found low variability among species for both metals compared to aqueous-exposure toxicity metrics. [...] <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> whole-body concentrations of metals in fish may be useful for Environmental Quality Guidelines, forensic evaluation, and ecological risk assessment. [...] An additional benefit includes the potential to characterize a contaminated ecosystem based on elevated whole-body metal concentrations resulting from acclimation.|$|E
