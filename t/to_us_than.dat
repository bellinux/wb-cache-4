25|$|While {{promoting}} the band's 2013 box set, Sound System, which Jones says {{will be the}} final time he works on Clash music, he discussed the band reuniting prior to Strummer's death.There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper Headon, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>than</b> the band.|$|E

500|$|By 1792, Lady Charlotte Finch {{had become}} ill and deaf. Princess Sophia remarked that autumn, [...] "I am grieved to death about her, she is if {{possible}} more kind <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>than</b> ever. Indeed, both [...] and her {{are so good}} {{to us that we}} should not be deserving of having such treasures about us, if we did not feel their kindness in the highest degree". Finch resigned from her role in November 1792 and retired on 5 January 1793, though she continued to correspond with {{members of the royal family}} and receive gifts from them, particularly the Prince of Wales, the future George IV. She received £600 in yearly payment, supplemented by income from the South Sea Company, until her death on 11 July 1813 at St James's Palace.|$|E

500|$|In a 3 September 2013 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Mick Jones discussed the band reuniting saying it {{likely would have}} never happened. Jones said [...] "There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't.

Jones also stated that the Sound System box set was the last time he will ever be involved in the band's releases. [...] "I'm not even thinking about any more Clash releases. This is it for me, and I say that with an exclamation mark." [...] Jones said.|$|E
2500|$|He faulted U.S. {{policy in}} his diary in June 1948 as the {{communist}} victory neared: [...] "All {{the power of the}} United States will not stem the tides of Asia, but all the wisdom of which we are capable might conceivably make those tides a little more friendly <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>than</b> they are now." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{pressure}} on Bismarck to object not only {{came from his}} monarch William I, but from Chief of Staff of the Prussian army Helmuth von Moltke. Moltke had additional reason to object: he desired war with France, stating flatly, [...] "Nothing could be more welcome <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>than</b> to have now the war that we must have." [...] Bismarck balked at such talk about war. He refused to actually engage France {{on the basis that}} he firmly believed that Prussia would gain a far more decisive advantage by merely opposing the sale and that Napoleon III could be thwarted due to his fear of war with Prussia.|$|E

Spain's World Cup-winning manager Vicente del Bosque paid tribute, stating that Xavi was [...] "a {{key part of the}} team's style of play" [...] and [...] "he was more important <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>than</b> even the manager", also adding, [...] "We will miss him {{both on and off the}} pitch. He is a player who we hold in great esteem both personally and as a player. He is and always will be a person and a player who is greatly valued by the federation, the coaching staff and by myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anglican theologian C. S. Lewis (1898-1963), {{reflecting}} {{on the history of}} the doctrine of purgatory in the Anglican Communion, said there were good reasons for [...] "casting doubt on the 'Romish doctrine concerning Purgatory' as that Romish doctrine had then become" [...] not merely a [...] "commercial scandal" [...] but also the picture in which the souls are tormented by devils, whose presence is [...] "more horrible and grievous <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>than</b> is the pain itself," [...] and where the spirit who suffers the tortures cannot, for pain, [...] "remember God as he ought to do." [...] Lewis believed instead in purgatory as presented in John Henry Newman's The Dream of Gerontius. By this poem, Lewis wrote, [...] "Religion has reclaimed Purgatory," [...] a process of purification that will normally involve suffering.|$|E

2500|$|He {{worked on}} a [...] "shovel brigade" [...] at the McNabb furnace and {{described}} the music made by the workers as they beat shovels, altering the tone while thrusting and withdrawing the metal part against the iron buggies {{to pass the time}} while waiting for the overfilled furnace to digest its ore. [...] "With a dozen men participating, the effect was sometimes remarkable...It was better <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>than</b> the music of a martial drum corps, and our rhythms were far more complicated." [...] He wrote, [...] "Southern Negroes sang about everything....They accompany themselves on anything from which they can extract a musical sound or rhythmical effect..." [...] He would later reflect that [...] "In this way, and from these materials, they set the mood for what we now call blues".|$|E
2500|$|Authors {{including}} McCarthy and McAuley {{have questioned}} {{whether it was}} necessary to engage the Japanese in a costly battle or whether they could have been contained and reduced by starvation. [...] Both concluded that a battle was necessary and that a victory was necessary for the Allies and not just MacArthur. Condon-Rall and Cowdrey have a similar position but a different rational, citing Eichelberger, who wrote that disease [...] "was a surer and more deadly peril <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>than</b> enemy marksmanship. We had to whip the Japanese before the malarial mosquito whipped us." [...] However, it is difficult not to question whether this victory could have been achieved without the loss that was incurred. It is clear that undue pressure for haste exacerbated the Allies losses. It is also apparent that the process of pinching off or infiltrating the Japanese defences produced results where repeated assaults failed to produce any gain. The losses suffered by the Australian forces limited their offensive capacity for [...] "months" [...] following the battle.|$|E
2500|$|Their tutor Aristotle {{described}} friendship as [...] "...one soul abiding in two bodies". That {{they themselves}} considered their friendship {{to be of}} such a kind is shown by {{the stories of the}} morning after the battle of Issus. Diodorus, Arrian and Curtius all describe the scene when Alexander and Hephaestion went together to visit the captured Persian royal family. Its senior member, the queen Sisygambis, knelt to Hephaestion to plead for their lives, having mistaken him for Alexander because he was taller, and both young men were wearing similar clothes. When she realized her mistake she was acutely embarrassed, but Alexander pardoned her, saying [...] "You were not mistaken, Mother; this man too is Alexander." [...] Their love for each other was no secret, as is borne out by their own words. Hephaestion, when replying to a letter to Alexander's mother, Olympias, said [...] "...you know that Alexander means more <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>than</b> anything." [...] Arrian says that Alexander, after Hephaestion's death, described him as [...] "...the friend I valued as my own life." [...] Paul Cartledge describes their closeness when he says: [...] "Alexander seems actually to have referred to Hephaestion as his alter ego." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1921, Cruikshank {{was hired}} as the pastor of the Westminster Presbyterian Church in Steubenville, Ohio, {{approximately}} 40 miles west of Pittsburgh. [...] He remained in Steubenville through at least 1926. [...] While working as a minister, Cruikshank continued his interest in football and {{used it as a}} theme in his speeches and sermons. [...] At a 1923 banquet honoring Steubenville's undefeated 1922 football team, Cruikshank spoke of the importance athletics:"I am for athletics in the school. [...] They create a school consciousness, call it spirit if you will. When you leave school after playing on its football team you have something that will always hold your school career near and dear to you. ... Athletics embue the fellow who plays and the fans as well in a spirit that never says die. ... That's the thing that counts in life, the never give up spirit. [...] To my mind if we can take this spirit out of high school with us it means more <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>than</b> our Latin or Greek.

2500|$|Exhibitions {{were often}} {{used during the}} Cold War to {{demonstrate}} culture and progress by both the United States and the Soviet Union. [...] In 1959, the American National Exhibition was held on Sokolniki Park in Moscow. [...] The exhibition was opened by Vice President Richard Nixon and attended by Walt Disney, Buckminster Fuller, William Randolph Hearst, and senior executives from Pepsi, Kodak and Macy's. [...] It featured American consumer goods, cars, boats, RCA color TVs, food, clothing, etc., and samples of American products such as Pepsi. [...] There was a typical American kitchen set up inside in which spectators could watch a Bird's Eye frozen meal be prepared. [...] An IBM RAMAC computer was programmed to answer 3,500 questions about America in Russian. [...] The most popular question was [...] "what {{is the meaning of}} the American Dream?" [...] The Soviets tried to limit the audience by only giving tickets to party members and setting up their own rival exhibition. [...] But ultimately people came, and the souvenir pins that were given out turned up in every corner of the country. [...] The Soviets banned printed material, but the Americans gave it out anyway. [...] The most popular items were the Bible and a Sears catalogue. [...] The guides for the exhibition were American graduate students, including African Americans and women, who spoke Russian. [...] This gave Russians the ability to speak to real Americans and ask difficult questions. [...] The ambassador to Moscow, Llewellyn Thompson, commented that [...] "the exhibition would be 'worth more <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>than</b> five new battleships." [...] Exhibitions like this were used to display the best a culture had to offer and basically show off in a way that appeared non threatening and even friendly.|$|E
