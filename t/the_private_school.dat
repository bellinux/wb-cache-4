5|$|In 1921, Skagen's Skipper School {{was opened}} to train navigators for both fishing boats and {{merchant}} ships. It {{is now the}} only remaining skipper school in Denmark with some 100 students from the whole of Scandinavia and 15 staff. In 2012, the school moved into new premises close to the Kattegat. In 1955, the folkschool Ankermedets skole was opened on Skagavej, initially with 483 pupils and 16 classes. It has been extended several times over the years, most recently when a new wing was added in 2003. <b>The</b> <b>private</b> <b>school</b> Brovandeskolen, a so-called free school, opened in 1977 for parents wishing to offer their children a new pedagogical approach.

5|$|Laffoon's early {{education}} was {{obtained in the}} public schools of Madisonville. While there, one of his teachers was his sister, Susan Isabella Laffoon, who was only 16 years old. At age 15, while plowing a field, Laffoon was kicked in the hip by a mule, requiring a six-week stay in a Nashville hospital. In the winter of the same year, he slipped on some ice and re-injured the hip. As a result of these injuries, his right leg was one-and-a-half inches shorter than his left leg, requiring him to wear special shoes and walk with a cane and a limp {{for the rest of his}} life. After his injury, Laffoon's parents decided that he could not make his living as a farmer and sent him to <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>school</b> of W. C. O'Bryan. By age 17, he was teaching in the common schools of Charleston in Hopkins County.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Monds was {{instrumental}} in formation of the first school. This private school was built in 1843, though Thomas Reibey converted it into St Andrews church in 1845, and the school moved elsewhere in the town. A Government school was built in 1873, next to the current recreation ground, and both schools were open as of 1883. <b>The</b> <b>private</b> <b>school</b> closed late in the 19th Century, but the Government school still had 65 students on the 1901 roll. The latter was a weatherboard building. It was extensively renovated in 1920 and was in use until the mid-1930s when the last school in Carrick closed. The building was relocated to nearby Hagley in 1938, though it was later demolished. In the same year the government began funding regular school transport from Carrick to the school at nearby Hagley, accompanying children from Hadspen whose school had also been closed. Since that time {{there has been no}} school in Carrick and a 1976 planning report stated the population was likely to remain insufficient to require one.|$|E

Soon after the family had moved to Via Vetrina in 1880 he began school at the convent of the French Sisters of Divine Providence in the Piazza Fiammetta. The family worshipped at Chiesa Nuova.

In 1886 too he was sent to <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>school</b> of Professor Giuseppe Marchi, close to the Piazza Venezia.

25|$|Following Marriott's {{successful}} acting {{debut in}} Oliver!, his family {{encouraged him to}} pursue an acting career.

After Marriott's enrolment at the Italia Conti Academy, he quickly gained acting roles, working consistently in film, television and radio, often typecast as the energetic Cockney kid. Soon he lost interest in acting and turned his attention back to his first love, which was music. His parents were devastated and his decision to give up acting caused a family rift.

The artistic talent of the young monk was noticed by Abbot Portoguaro Bernardino, on a visit from Rome. So in 1880, Medović was placed in the monastery of St Isidoro in Rome, known for its Nazarene painters. He was assigned to Lodovico Seitz, an influential artist who painted the frescoes in the Cathedral of Đakovo. However, the rigid and outdated artistic style did not suit Medović, and he looked for a different teacher in Giuseppe Grandi, then in <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>school</b> of Antonio Ciseri in Florence.|$|E
