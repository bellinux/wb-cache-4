40|$|Four primary plasma {{instability}} processes {{have been proposed}} in the literature to explain the generation of phase scintillation associated with polar-cap plasma patches. These are the Gradient Drift, Current Convective and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and a small-scale “Turbulence” process. In this paper the range of possible values of the linear growth-rates {{for each of these}} processes is explored using Dynamics Explorer 2 satellite observations. It is found that the inertial <b>Turbulence</b> <b>instability</b> is the dominant process, followed by inertial Gradient Drift, collisional Turbulence and collisional shortwave Current Convective instabilities. The other processes, such as Kelvin-Helmhotz, collisional Gradient Drift and inertial shortwave Current Convective instabilities very rarely (< 1 % of the time) give rise to a growth rate exceeding 1 / 60, that is deemed to be significant (in publications) to give rise to GPS scintillation...|$|E

40|$|The noise {{generated}} by large scale <b>turbulence</b> structures and <b>instability</b> waves of jets is discussed. Emphasis {{is placed on}} supersonic jets with moderate to high Reynolds numbers. This is because it is in these jets that unambiguous experimental and theoretical evidence is found indicating that large <b>turbulence</b> structures and <b>instability</b> waves are directly responsible for generating the dominant part of the noise. For subsonic jets similar large <b>turbulence</b> structures and <b>instability</b> waves do {{play a crucial role}} in the dynamics, spread, and mixing of the jet fluid. However, at subsonic convection speeds, they do not appear to be efficient noise generators. Many investigators believe that the dominant noise source of subsonic jets is, in fact, the small scale turbulence. As yet, this belief has not yet received universal acceptance. The issues involved are complicated and are not easy to resolve...|$|R
40|$|Turbulence is flow plus instability. It is {{a quality}} of chaotic flow that occurs beyond a certain limit point in a system. We {{encounter}} moments of turbulence throughout our everyday lives - the flow of tap water, adding milk to a cup of tea, turning a street corner {{in the city and}} being buffeted by a gust of wind. In a meteorological sense, turbulence occurs when two differing masses of air collide, creating pockets of disruption as the various forces try to reconcile themselves. It is a disruptive process of coming together. Seemingly stable objects and systems become disrupted by the chaotic qualities that are introduced by <b>turbulence.</b> <b>Instability</b> and unpredictability are turbulence&# 039;s inherent qualities, qualities that tend to carry negative connotations compared to the contrasting terms - stability and predictability. Although, historically, turbulence has been identified with disorder or noise, more recently it has come to be understood, despite appearances, as highly organised (Prigogine & Stengers 1984 : 141). Turbulence occurs across a range of scales, from the very large to the microscopically small. It is dynamic, and dependent on time, occurring as a system evolves and crosses certain threshold conditions...|$|E
40|$|Extreme {{conditions}} in natural flows are examined, {{starting with a}} turbulent big bang. A hydro-gravitational-dynamics cosmology model is adopted. Planck-Kerr <b>turbulence</b> <b>instability</b> causes Planck-particle turbulent combustion. Inertial-vortex forces induce a non-turbulent kinetic energy cascade to Planck-Kolmogorov scales where vorticity is produced, overcoming 10 ^ 113 Pa Planck-Fortov pressures. The spinning, expanding fireball has a slight deficit of Planck antiparticles. Space and mass-energy powered by gluon viscous stresses expand exponentially at speeds > 10 ^ 25 c. Turbulent temperature and spin fluctuations fossilize at scales larger than ct, where c is light speed and t is time. Because "dark-energy" antigravity forces vanish when inflation ceases, and because turbulence produces entropy, the universe is closed and will collapse and rebound. Density and spin fossils of big bang turbulent mixing trigger structure formation in the plasma epoch. Fragmenting protosuperclustervoids and protoclustervoids produce weak turbulence until the plasma-gas transition give chains of protogalaxies with the morphology of turbulence. Chain galaxy clusters observed at large redshifts ~ 8. 6 support this interpretation. Protogalaxies fragment into clumps, each with a trillion Earth-mass H-He gas planets. These make stars, supernovae, the first chemicals, the first oceans and the first life soon after the cosmological event.

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{in business and}} marketing has highlighted {{the importance of the}} concept of strategic orientation or ‘strategic directions implemented by a firm to create proper behaviours for the continuous superior performance of a business (Gatingnon and Xuereb 1997, p. 78). This study seeks to determine if strategic orientation can help improve firm performance of Malaysian SMEs. Although, many types of strategic orientations have been discussed in the literature, this study chose three most comprehensive constructs that encompass significant actions targeting main areas in the operation of any business. These include; entrepreneurial orientation relating to the proactive leadership skills of the entrepreneur, market orientation directed to winning over and retaining customers with best marketing practices and interaction orientation focussed on customer relationship and management. This study applied quantitative method and used Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). As there has been some criticism that direct correlation of one particular strategic orientation to firm performance is prone to simplification, this study adopts a combination of these strategic orientations to present a holistic picture of the effect of strategic orientation on firm performance. This study also employs innovation success as mediating variable of the strategic orientation/ firm performance to present a more nuanced picture of this relationship by arguing that strategic orientation is able to deliver superior firm performance directly or indirectly by affecting innovation success. In addition, market <b>turbulence</b> (<b>instability</b> of customer preference) and competitive intensity (presence of aggressive competitors) are employed as antecedent variables on strategic orientation to reflect factors of external environment that can intervene in the actions of a firm...|$|E

40|$|Since Stringer [1] {{had shown}} that any radial {{location}} in tokamak plasma is prone to a spontaneous poloidal spin-up with a concomitant rise of a radial electric field, plasma rotation and radial electric field gradually emerged as important factors in stability considerations for toroidal equilibrium and transport. As novel studies indicate, also tokamak <b>turbulence</b> <b>instability</b> due to the geodesic acoustic mode (GAM) or zonal flow have similar mechanisms involving perturbations of the plasma rotation velocities and the radial electric field [2 - 4]. On the other hand, as plasma collisionality suppresses such instabilities, it {{is less likely to}} encounter rotational turbulence, for example, in high collisional plasmas with steep gradients. In the present extension of the neoclassical theory of rotation and electric field in high collisionality tokamak plasmas with steep gradients [5 - 6], however, it will be shown that in some radial interval the poloidal (and to some extent also toroidal) rotation velocity displays chaotic behaviour. 1. Basic Equations Using the notations of former publications [5 - 6], the governing equations for the described regime are, continuity equation for the ions,) hh(JS) hh(JN i, 1 Nii, 1 it ψχφψ−χψφχ − Γ∂−=Γ∂+ ∂ (1) where Niiii SandUN =Γ are the ion flux and ion particle source, respectively, and momentum balance equation summed over both species: BJ) UUNm() UNm (iiiiiiiii ×+Π⋅−∇=⋅∇+ ∂ (2) Here iΠ is the viscosity tensor including i, 0 Π, i 21,−Π, i, 43 −Π contributions as defined in Refs.

40|$|A planet's {{magnetosheath}} {{extends from}} downstream of its bow shock {{up to the}} magnetopause where the solar wind flow is deflected around the magnetosphere and the solar wind embedded magnetic field lines are draped. This makes the region an important site for plasma <b>turbulence,</b> <b>instabilities,</b> reconnection and plasma depletion layers. A relatively high Alfvén Mach number solar wind and a polar-flattened magnetosphere make the magnetosheath of Saturn both physically and geometrically distinct from the Earth's. The polar flattening is predicted to affect the magnetosheath magnetic field structure and thus the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction. Here we investigate the magnetic field in the magnetosheath {{with the expectation that}} polar flattening is manifested in the overall draping pattern. We compare an accumulation of Cassini data between 2004 and 2010 with global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and an analytical model representative of a draped field between axisymmetric boundaries. The draping patterns measured are well captured and in broad agreement for given upstream conditions with those of the MHD simulations (which include polar flattening). The deviations from the analytical model, based on no polar flattening, suggest that non-axisymmetry is invariably a key feature of the magnetosphere's global structure. Our results show a comprehensive overview of the configuration of the magnetic field in a non-axisymmetric magnetosheath as revealed by Cassini. We anticipate our assessment to provide an insight to this barely studied interface between a high Alfvénic bow shock and a dynamic magnetosphere...|$|R
40|$|A Japanese-French field {{campaign}} {{devoted to}} the study of <b>turbulence</b> and <b>instabilities</b> in the troposphere and lower stratosphere was conducted in September 2011 for three weeks at the Shigaraki MU observatory (Japan). During the experiment, 59 radiosondes (Vaisala RS 92 G) were successfully launched and MU radar/lidar measurements were performed. The detection of turbulence from the in situ profiles is based on a Thorpe analysis. We have developed an original method for selecting the "true" turbulent events within the profile, i. e for rejecting the events induced by instrumental noise. The method is based on both an optimal noise reduction and a statistical hypothesis test. From the raw data of radiosoundings (3 - 6 m vertical resolution), we detected those turbulent regions whose vertical extent is larger than ~ 40 m in the troposphere, ~ 15 m in the lower stratosphere. By taking into account the water vapor saturation effects, we also detected (conditional) static instabilities within the clouds. In addition, the MU radar measurements were acquired in range imaging (FII) mode, allowing to observe <b>turbulence</b> and KH <b>instabilities</b> with an exceptional time-space resolution (~ several 10 m, 20 s).

40|$|A {{new theory}} of shear {{instability}} in a turbulent environment {{is applied to}} eight days of velocity and density profiles from the upper-equatorial Pacific. This period featured a regular diurnal cycle of surface forcing, together with a clear response in upper-oceanmixing. During the day, a layer of stable stratification and shear forms at the surface. During late afternoon and evening, this stratified shear layer descends, leaving the nocturnal mixing layer above it. Using high-resolution current measurements, the detailed structure of the descending shear layer is seen for the first time. Linear stability analysis is conducted using a newmethod that accounts {{for the effects of}} preexisting <b>turbulence</b> on <b>instability</b> growth. Shear instability follows a diurnal cycle linked to the afternoon descent of the surface shear layer.
