500|$|During the {{afternoon}} of September14, two successive thunderstorms produced more than [...] of rain—a 1-in-100 year event—near Hildale, Utah in Washington County. The National Weather Service issued a strongly worded flash flood warning at 20:22UTC (2:22p.m. MDT) for the area, stating [...] "Move to higher ground now. Act quickly <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>your</b> life". The first storm resulted in a [...] rise along the Short Creek, as measured by a stream gauge in Colorado City, Arizona, in 19minutes around 21:18UTC (3:18p.m. MDT), with residents gathering nearby to observe. Between 22:48 and 23:05UTC (4:48 and 5:05p.m. MDT), a second surge of water swept down the creek with the Colorado City gauge reporting a rise of the gauge stopped reporting at 23:47UTC (5:47p.m. MDT). The second flood swept away two vehicles carrying a collective 16people while they were observing the rising waters. Thirteen {{people were killed and}} three children were rescued.

500|$|The {{daughter}} of billionaire Nikolas Natchios {{and the love}} interest of Matt Murdock. At a very young age, she witnessed {{the murder of her}} mother, and since then her father has had her become highly trained in martial arts. For the role of Elektra, many actresses were looked into with considerations including Penélope Cruz, Salma Hayek, Natalie Portman, Lucy Liu, Jessica Alba, and Katie Holmes. A short-list was eventually made, giving the choices of Jennifer Garner, Jolene Blalock, Mía Maestro and Rhona Mitra, with Garner finally becoming the actress to land the role. Garner said of the character, [...] "I think she's strong and cool and beautiful and smart. She'd be a good role model." [...] Garner noted the costume would be different, as Elektra in comics often wears red satin but in the film wears black leather. Garner explained, [...] "he red would never have worked for hiding a harness, and I know this sounds ridiculous, but you have <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>your</b> skin a little bit. They throw me around so much on the rooftop [...] I got cut through the leather, so imagine if I hadn't had anything." ...|$|E
500|$|Having left Cold Feet, Ripley {{began to}} take on more leading roles; her first role was as {{housewife}} Deanna in the BBC thriller Green-Eyed Monster, which was broadcast in September 2001. She researched her character, a murderer, by visiting a coroner. Guardian critic Gareth McLean wrote of her performance, [...] "Ripley {{did a good job}} of exorcising the ghost of Jenny Gifford [...] by coolly cranking up the insane desperation and needy malevolence to an impressive degree." [...] In 2002, she played domestic abuse victim Donna Massey in Danny Brocklehurst's The Stretford Wives. Ripley was initially not eager to play another character from around Manchester so soon after leaving Cold Feet, but she changed her mind after reading the script. She did not research spousal abuse to play her character, a woman struggling to bring up her two children in a run-down house while her husband is imprisoned, because she did not find it difficult to [...] "work out what it's like to be scared and want <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>your</b> kids". Also in 2002, Ripley played Rose Bell in the ITV post-war period drama Dead Gorgeous, alongside Helen McCrory. The following year, she provided the voice of Meg in the ITV adaptation of the Meg and Mog children's books, before playing Jill in the third series of the BBC One sitcom Bedtime at the end of 2003.|$|E

[...] She commented, [...] "If [...] are offended, they have the right to be offended – just like Christians." [...] With regard to keeping with the tenets of Freedom of Speech, Mimi is permitting a wide array of depictions of Muhammad [...] "except for those inciting violence or pornographic in nature." [...] "Mainstream society does whatever the Muslim society asks out of fear of violence or political correctness. But if you want to live in a Western society and use the system <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>your</b> rights, you have to be willing to allow others to have theirs as well," [...] said Mimi.|$|E
2500|$|Kahn and the Hudson Institute advised against {{starting}} a counterinsurgency war in Vietnam, but, once it had begun, they gave {{advice on how}} to wage it. In an interview, he said that he and the Institute preferred not to give advice to (for example) the Secretary of Defense, because disagreement at such a high level might be regarded as treason, whereas disagreement with, say, the Deputy Undersecretary was regarded as no more than technical. As regards a plan, British advisers, with experience from the Commonwealth's successful counterinsurgency war in Malaya, were consulted. Kahn and the Institute, however, judged that a crucial difference between the Vietnemese and Malayan situations was the British rural constabulary in Malaya. An Institute study of the major counterinsurgency wars in recent history found a 100% correlation between successful wars and effective police forces. Kahn said [...] "...the purpose of an army is <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>your</b> police force. We had an army in Vietnam without a purpose." ...|$|E
