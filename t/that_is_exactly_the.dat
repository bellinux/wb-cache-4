50|$|Brachyura-A cursed titan crab. There are two {{different}} Brachyuras <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same, except <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> a super rare version with 'glitters'.|$|R
30|$|As a consequence, {{the use of}} {{the exact}} shear {{correction}} factor for the Mindlin plate gives solutions <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same as for the Reddy plate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> way I feel!" [...] Lemuel {{was proud}} of the coincidence. He said, to commend himself further to Miss Carver, [...] "I have just been round to see him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> {{case with}} the Lapham family," [...] said the son, smiling. [...] "The father and mother rather apologised about not getting time to read, and the young ladies by no means scorned it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> sort {{of weather}} {{we have in}} England!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "If that's all these foreigners can manage in their own country, what right have they to come over here, as they do, and grumble about our weather?" ...|$|E

60|$|The subeditor {{had done}} his work well. He had not been ambiguous. What he {{intended}} to convey to the reader <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Miss Aline Peters, of America, {{was going to marry}} the Honorable Frederick Threepwood, son of the Earl of Emsworth; and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> impression the average reader got.|$|R
60|$|Yes, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> idea <b>that</b> <b>was</b> in La Certe's brain, and which, {{he hoped}} and fully expected, to reduce to {{practice}} in course of time--if Duncan McKay would only assist him by making him a few advances at that present time.|$|R
60|$|A {{critic who}} posed as an {{authority}} on field sports assured me {{that no one ever}} went out hunting when roses were in full bloom. Personally, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> season I would select for the chase, but then I know more about flowers than I do about foxes, and like them much better.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{the devil}} is this?" [...] said Essper George. [...] "Why, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same {{question}} I myself asked when I saw a tall, pompous, proud fellow, dressed like a peacock on a May morning, {{standing at the door}} just now. He looked as if he would pass himself off for an ambassador at least; but I told him that if he got his wages paid he was luckier than most servants. Was I right, your Excellency?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, here's {{something}} else I remember. It's {{about the first}} time I ever stole a watermelon. [...] "Stole" [...] is a strong word. Stole? Stole? No, I don't mean that. It {{was the first time}} I ever withdrew a watermelon. It was the first time I ever extracted a watermelon. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> word I want--"extracted." [...] It is definite. It is precise. It perfectly conveys my idea. Its use in dentistry connotes the delicate shade of meaning I am looking for. You know we never extract our own teeth.|$|E

50|$|What {{would you}} do if you {{discovered}} that thirteen people slated for execution had <b>been</b> found innocent? <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> question <b>that</b> Illinois Governor George Ryan faced in his final days in office. Deadline is a compelling look insider America’s prisons, highlighting one man’s unlikely and historic actions against the system.|$|R
500|$|Given {{printing}} {{practices at}} the time (which included type-setting from dictation), no two editions {{turned out to be}} identical, and it is relatively rare to find even two copies <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same. Certainly there is no warrant for assuming—as would-be [...] "code-breakers" [...] are prone to do—that either the spellings or the punctuation of any edition are Nostradamus's originals.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Hodder, what a {{wonderful}} sermon!" [...] she cried. [...] "I can't express how it made me feel--so delinquent! Of course <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> effect you wished. And I was just telling Wallis I was so glad I waited until Tuesday to go East, or I should have missed it. You surely must come on to Hampton and visit us, and preach it over again in our little stone church there, by the sea. Good-by and don't forget! I'll write you, setting the date, only we'd be {{glad to have you}} any time." ...|$|E
6000|$|The pencil dropped. The hand lifted. The form of {{the sleeper}} {{expanded}} with power. Her face took on benignity and lofty serenity. She rose slowly, impressively, and with her hand upraised in a peculiar gesture, laid a blessing upon the head of her hostess. There was so much of sweetness and tolerance in her face, so much of dignity and power in every movement that I was moved to applaud the actress. As we all sat thus, deeply impressed by her towering attitude, Mrs. Cameron whispered: [...] "Why, it is Bishop Blank! <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> way he held his hand--his robe!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Our ingenious American cousins {{have invented}} a phrase {{to express the}} {{position}} of a man who wants to join {{one or the other of}} two parties--such as their two parties 'Democrats' and 'Republicans'--but can't make up his mind WHICH. Such a man is said to be [...] "sitting on the fence." [...] Now <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> position of the red counter you have just placed on the division-line. He likes the look of No. 5, and he likes the look of No. 6, and he doesn't know WHICH to jump down into. So there he sits astride, silly fellow, dangling his legs, one on each side of the fence! ...|$|E
50|$|Yet another {{characterization}} of order isomorphisms <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> monotone bijections <b>that</b> have a monotone inverse.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{he would}} be {{technically}} a Labor Senator, he vowed never {{to vote for the}} Whitlam government. Field was conservative and religious and was openly critical of what he saw as a range of [...] "immoral" [...] policies being advanced by Whitlam and his government. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> sort of person wanted by Bjelke-Petersen, who responded by nominating Field in the Parliament of Queensland as the new senator.|$|R
5000|$|One of Crain's’s biggest {{assets from}} the {{beginning}} was its physical appearance. “The first major sign of encouragement we got was for our lively, contemporary look,” Steve Yahn said. “A {{lot of people said}} it looked as much like a book about the city as a financial publication. And <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> intent — Crain's {{was meant to be a}} ‘hybrid’ between a city publication and a financial publication.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir John {{listened in}} silence as he {{continued}} to examine one envelope after another through the glass. 'Now, Sir John, if we come to the Mays '73, we shall find that just about that time there has been no new stamp brought into use. There isn't one, either, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> Caldigate breadth. I've brought a rule by which you can get to the fiftieth of an inch.' Here Bagwax brought out a little ivory instrument marked all over with figures. 'Of course they're intended to be of the same pattern. But gradually, very gradually, the circle has always become smaller. Isn't that conclusive? The Caldigate impression is a little, very little--ever so little--but a little smaller than any of the Mays '73. Isn't that conclusive?' ...|$|E
60|$|Well, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> way it {{was with}} Happy Jack Squirrel, as he and Tommy Tit the Chickadee started {{to go over to}} Farmer Brown's house to look for Farmer Brown's boy. Tommy Tit had been there often, so he didn't think {{anything}} about it, but Happy Jack never had been there, and if the truth were known, his heart was going pitapat, pitapat, with excitement and perhaps just a little fear. Through the Old Orchard they went, Tommy Tit flitting ahead and keeping a sharp watch for danger. When they reached the old stone wall on the edge of Farmer Brown's dooryard, Tommy told Happy Jack to hide there while he went to see if the way was clear. He was back in a few minutes.|$|E
6000|$|The idea of Providence {{was very}} gaily travested by Daudet in [...] "Tartarin in the Alps." [...] You will {{remember}} how Tartarin's friend {{assured him that}} all Switzerland was one great Trust, intent upon attracting tourists and far too wise and kind to permit them to venture into real danger, that all the precipices were netted invisibly, and all the loose rocks guarded against falling, that avalanches were prearranged spectacles and the crevasses at their worst slippery ways down into kindly catchment bags. If the mountaineer tried to get into real danger he was turned back by specious excuses. Inspired by this persuasion Tartarin behaved with incredible daring. [...] . <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> Providence theory of the whole world. There {{can be no doubt}} that it does enable many a timid soul to get through life with a certain recklessness. And provided there is no slip into a crevasse, the Providence theory works well. It would work altogether well if there were no crevasses.|$|E
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> {{impression}} left upon my own mind. I {{began to}} conclude, in a dim, formless way, {{that my father}} {{must have been a}} somewhat stern and unsympathetic man; that I had felt constrained and uncomfortable in his presence upstairs, and had often been pleased to get away from his eye to the comparative liberty and ease of my own room or of the maid-servants' quarters.|$|R
50|$|Interestingly, {{while the}} program is now free, several online writer stores still offer it for sale. It appears <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same program.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article <b>is</b> to show <b>that</b> the Navier-Stokes {{equations}} can be rewritten as a set of linearized inhomogeneous Euler equations (in convective form) with source terms <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same as those that would result from externally imposed shear stress and energy flux perturbations. These results are used to develop a mathematical basis for some existing and potential new jet noise models by appropriately choosing the base flow about which the linearization is carried out...|$|R
6000|$|It {{would not}} be entirely convincing. It would sound a little far-fetched and unreal. But it would sound exactly like our utterances about the Irish, as they sound to all Americans, and rather {{especially}} to Anti-Irish Americans. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> impression we produce {{on the people of}} the United States when we say, as we do say in substance, something like this: 'We mean no harm to the poor dear Irish, so dreamy, so irresponsible, so incapable of order or organisation. If we were to withdraw from their country they would only fight among themselves; they have no notion of how to rule themselves. There is something charming about their unpracticability, about their very incapacity for the coarse business of politics. But for their own sakes it is impossible to leave these emotional visionaries to ruin themselves in the attempt to rule themselves. They are like children; but they are our own children, and we understand them. We accept full responsibility for acting as their parents and guardians.' ...|$|E
60|$|The view, as I have said, is charming; {{but in the}} day {{you must}} keep the lattice-blinds close shut, or the sun would drive you mad; and when {{the sun goes down}} you must shut up all the windows, or the {{mosquitoes}} would tempt you to commit suicide. So {{at this time of the}} year, you don't see much of the prospect within doors. As for the flies, you don't mind them. Nor the fleas, whose size is prodigious, and whose name is Legion, and who populate the coach- house to that extent that I daily expect to see the carriage going off bodily, drawn by myriads of industrious fleas in harness. The rats are kept away, quite comfortably, by scores of lean cats, who roam about the garden for that purpose. The lizards, of course, nobody cares for; they play in the sun, and don't bite. The little scorpions are merely curious. The beetles are rather late, and have not appeared yet. The frogs are company. There is a preserve of them in the grounds of the next villa; and after nightfall, one would think that scores upon scores of women in pattens were going up and down a wet stone pavement without a moment's cessation. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> noise they make.|$|E
60|$|It {{is better}} to be in a bad prison than in a good one. From the {{standpoint}} of the prisoner this is not at all a paradox; if only because in a bad prison he is more likely to escape. But apart from that, a man was in many ways better off in the old dirty and corrupt prison, where he could bribe turnkeys to bring him drink and meet fellow-prisoners to drink with. Now <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> difference between the present system and the proposed system. Nobody worth talking about respects the present system. Capitalism is a corrupt prison. That is the best that can be said for Capitalism. But it is {{something to be said for}} it; for a man is a little freer in that corrupt prison than he would be in a complete prison. As a man can find one jailer more lax than another, so he could find one employer more kind than another; he has at least a choice of tyrants. In the other case he finds the same tyrant at every turn. Mr. Shaw and other rational Socialists have agreed that the State would be in practice government by a small group. Any independent man who disliked that group would find his foe waiting for him at the end of every road.|$|E
6000|$|He took up {{his little}} Bible, to read one of the passages, as his father had advised him. He {{happened}} to open at a mark which his father had put in at {{the parable of the}} prodigal son. The first verse which his eye fell upon, was the verse, [...] "I will arise and go to my father." [...] Rollo thought <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> thing for him to do--to go and confess his fault to his father.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some {{of these}} days," [...] he said, [...] "you {{may come to}} be of <b>the</b> opinion <b>that</b> he <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> husband you would wish your niece to have." ...|$|R
