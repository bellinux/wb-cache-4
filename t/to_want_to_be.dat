The later ending also explores the narrator's own death, whereas the earlier version serves as a Christian consolation regarding death.|$|E
5|$|Riefenstahl fell in {{love with}} the arts in her childhood. She began to paint and write poetry at the age of four. She was also athletic, and at the age of twelve joined a {{gymnastics}} and swimming club. Her mother was confident her daughter would grow up to be successful in the field of art and therefore gave her full support, unlike Riefenstahl's father, who was not interested in his daughter's artistic inclinations. In 1918, when she was 16, Riefenstahl attended a presentation of Snow White which interested her deeply; it led her <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a dancer. Her father instead wanted to provide his daughter with an education that could lead to a more dignified occupation. His wife, however, continued to support her daughter's passion. Without her father's knowledge, she enrolled Riefenstahl in dance and ballet classes at the Grimm-Reiter Dance School in Berlin, where she quickly became a star pupil.|$|E

25|$|Denney was at {{the center}} of {{controversy}} over a series of appointments that came to be known as “the Dirty Deal”. In 1921 the term of respected Chancellor Charles M. Curtis was due to expire. Denney could easily have reappointed him, but instead chose to nominate Josiah O. Wolcott to the post. Wolcott was thought <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Chancellor, but had the added advantage of being a Democratic U.S. Senator, whose appointment as Chancellor would create the opportunity for Denney to appoint a Republican to the U.S. Senate. The scenario created weeks of clamor, with the Delaware Bar demanding the reappointment of Curtis and Wolcott saying he would refuse the appointment. Denney persisted though, and Wolcott was appointed, resigning his U.S. Senate seat. Then Denney dropped a bombshell by appointing his friend and Republican Party leader, T. Coleman du Pont, to the U.S. Senate seat. The press exploded, convinced that du Pont, one of the wealthiest men in the country, had bought the position for himself. Du Pont was eventually punished by being defeated in the U.S. Senate election of 1922, but Wolcott served a long and distinguished career as Chancellor.|$|E
500|$|Bruno Bettelheim {{remarks that}} [...] "the more simple and {{straightforward}} a good {{character in a}} fairy tale, {{the easier it is}} for a child to identify with it and to reject the bad other." [...] The child identifies with a good hero because the hero's condition makes a positive appeal to him. If the character is a very good person, then the child is likely <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good too. Amoral tales, however, show no polarization or juxtaposition of good and bad persons because amoral tales such as [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] build character, not by offering choices between good and bad, but by giving the child hope that even the meekest can survive. Morality is of little concern in these tales, but rather, an assurance is provided that one can survive and succeed in life. Small children can do little on their own and may give up in disappointment and despair with their attempts. Fairy stories, however, give great dignity to the smallest achievements (such as befriending an animal or being befriended by an animal, as in [...] "Puss in Boots") and that such ordinary events may lead to great things. Fairy stories encourage children to believe and trust that their small, real achievements are important although perhaps not recognized at the moment.|$|E

Worldly as <b>to</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> housed and warmed, worldly as <b>to</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fed, worldly as to the greed with which I inwardly compared how much I got of those good things with how much father and mother got, when, rarely, those good things were going.|$|R

500|$|Guitar Hero {{and other}} rock music-based games work with record {{companies}} to license each song for its use, costing a per-song average of $25,000 {{for the rights}} to use a master recording and $10,000 {{for the rights to}} make a cover. [...] The impact of Guitar Hero and Rock Band has caused record companies to create dedicated video game liaisons to handle the inclusions of songs in these games. The record and game companies work together to tie in releases of downloadable content with album releases and concert appearances, such as by the simultaneous release of Metallica's Death Magnetic album and as playable Guitar Hero tracks. [...] However, some in the music industry have raised concerns that the music labels are not receiving fair compensation considering the success of the games. [...] Edgar Bronfman Jr., chairman and chief executive for Warner Music Group, stated that [...] "The amount being paid to the industry, even though their games are entirely dependent on the content that we own and control, is far too small." [...] Tim Riley, vice president of music affairs at Activision, believes that the increase in popularity of the game series has led more people, including musicians and music labels, <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of the success: [...] "The number of people interested in being associated with the game is probably a thousand times more than we can get into the game." [...] Activision CEO Robert Kotick has stated, in response to the record company's claims, that the impact that the Guitar Hero games have caused game developers and publishers to question if they [...] "should be paying any money at all and whether it should be the reverse." [...] Mötley Crüe manager Allen Kovac noted that artists make a larger share of the sale of each downloaded game song compared to iTunes, and that bands that own their own master recordings earn even a larger percentage from music licensing rights. [...] Michael Pachter, an industry analyst for Wedbush Morgan, noted that Guitar Hero is not dependent on a single record label, as there is nearly a 2000-year supply of songs available at the current rate of content releases, and a full music industry denial to the game series could lead to anti-trust measures. [...] Patcher also contrasted Bronfman's view, stating that users are not buying the games for the songs, but for the game, with each song providing its own challenge. [...] However, analysis believe that Activision's attitude on music licensing may have influenced the decision of Apple Corps, Ltd. to give the lucrative licensing agreement for The Beatles' music to MTV Games, who were more flexible in their negotiations.|$|E

2500|$|Prior {{to recent}} history most {{postgraduate}} {{education in the}} United States was accomplished using the mentor system. A physician would finish a rotating internship and move to some town and be taught by the local physicians the skills needed for that particular town. This allowed each community's needs to be met by {{the teaching of the}} new general practitioner the skills needed in that community. This also allowed the new physician to start making a living and raising a family, etc. General practitioners would be the surgeons, the obstetricians, and the internists for their given communities. Changes in demographics and the growing complexities of the developing bodies of knowledge made it necessary to produce more highly trained surgeons and other specialists. For many physicians it was a natural desire <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered [...] "specialists".

2500|$|Tiffany was {{described}} as a [...] "practical feminist" [...] who would always get her man.

She wants to look good and wear make-up and she can get very emotionally entangled sometimes." [...] She has also landed the label of a [...] "hot party girl". Tiffany's rivalry with Emily helped James understand Tiffany's characterisation, she stated; [...] "It challenged Tiffany. She always expects people <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> beautiful. It showed me the naivete about Tiffany that I hadn't seen before. She assumes that she knows how everyone thinks and what everyone else wants from life, but then you realise she's possibly quite skewed and self-centred. It's obviously such a big part of Tiffany's life that it over-rides everything else. She's not brainless, it's just her priorities. James described her as, [...] "very heroic" [...] and believed that she, [...] "always puts up a fight for the underdog." ...|$|E
