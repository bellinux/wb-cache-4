He supported the banishment of Cisneros and the members of the Real Audience, and the execution of Liniers and other counter-revolutionaries defeated in Córdoba.

Document fields can be decided efficiently {{if there are}} many relevant FA terms in that documents. An earlier approach built FA terms dictionary using a WWW search engine, but there were irrelevant selected FA terms in that dictionary because that approach extracted FA terms from <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>documents.</b> This paper proposes a new approach for extracting FA terms using passage (portions of a document text) technique rather than extracting them from <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>documents.</b> This approach extracts FA terms more accurately than the earlier approach. The proposed approach is evaluated for 38, 372 articles from the large tagged corpus. According to experimental results, {{it turns out that}} by using the new approach about 24 % more relevant FA terms are appending to the earlier FA term dictionary and around 32 % irrelevant FA terms are deleted. Moreover, precision and recall are achieved 98 % and 94 % respectively using the new approach...|$|R

60|$|But that {{sentence}} of mystic meaning shone {{out before him}} like a transparency, illuminated {{in the darkness of}} his mind; he determined to take it for his motto until he should be victorious in his quest. When he took his candle, to retire apparently to bed, he again drew forth the manuscript, and, sitting down by the dim light, tried vainly to read it; but he could not as yet settle himself to concentrated and regular effort; he kept turning the leaves of the manuscript, in the hope that some other illuminated sentence might gleam out upon him, as the first had done, and shed a light on the context around it; and that then another would be discovered, with similar effect, until <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>document</b> would thus be illuminated with separate stars of light, converging and concentrating in one radiance that should make the whole visible. But such was his bad fortune, not another word of the manuscript was he able to read that whole evening; and, moreover, while he had still an inch of candle left, Aunt Keziah, in her nightcap,--as witch-like a figure as ever went to a wizard meeting in the forest with Septimius's ancestor,--appeared {{at the door of the}} room, aroused from her bed, and shaking her finger at him.|$|E
60|$|More {{than one}} of my {{doorstep}} acquaintance, in fact, {{seemed to have no}} other stock in trade than this fond desire, and to thrive with it in our sympathetic community. It is scarcely possible but the reader has met the widow of Giovanni Cascamatto, a Vesuvian lunatic who has long set fire to their home on the slopes of the volcano, and perished in the flames. She was our first Italian acquaintance in Charlesbridge, presenting herself with a little subscription-book which she sent in for inspection, with a printed certificate to the facts of her history signed with the somewhat conventionally Saxon names of William Tompkins and John Johnson. These gentlemen set forth, in terms vaguer than can be reproduced, that her object in coming to America was to get money to go back to Italy; and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>document</b> had so fictitious an air that it made us doubt even the nationality of the bearer; but we were put to shame by the decent joy she manifested in an Italian salutation. There was no longer a question of imposture in anybody's mind; we gladly paid tribute to her poetic fiction, and she thanked us with a tranquil courtesy that placed the obligation where it belonged. As she turned to go with many good wishes, we pressed her to have some dinner, but she answered with a compliment insurpassably flattering, she had just dined--in another palace. The truth is, {{there is not a single}} palace on Benicia Street, and our little box of pine and paper would hardly have passed for a palace on the stage, where these things are often contrived with great simplicity; but as we had made a little Italy together, she touched it with the exquisite politeness of her race, and it became for the instant a lordly mansion, standing on the Chiaja, or the Via Nuovissima, or the Canalazzo.|$|E

However, this doesn’t mean {{we will not be}} able to elaborate more solid hypotheses in the future.

40|$|Present day summarisation {{technologies}} are imperfect. At {{a certain level}} of abstraction, they all work by performing data reduction over the original document source. In order for such summaries to be useful, it is necessary to be able to know how they relate to the documents. In order for such summaries to be usable, it is necessary for them to function as windows into <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>documents,</b> with suitably designed interfaces for navigation into areas of particular interest. This paper discusses the notion of strong contextualisation of document highlights, how this translates into necessary features for document analysis, and how the document abstractions derived from such principles facilitate dynamic delivery of document content. We argue that dynamic document abstractions effectively mediate different levels of granularity of analysis, from terse document highlights to fully contextualised foci of particular interest. We describe a range of dynamic document viewers which embody novel presentatio...|$|R
40|$|The more {{extended}} way {{of acquiring}} information for knowledge based systems is manually. However, {{the high cost}} of this approach and the availability of alternative Knowledge Sources has lead to an increasing use of automatic acquisition approaches. In this paper we present TURBIO, a Text-Based Intelligent System (TBIS) that extracts information contained in restricted-domain documents. The system acquires part of its knowledge about the structure of the documents and the way the information is presented (i. e. syntactic-semantic rules) from a training set of them. Then, a database is created by means of applying these syntactic-semantic rules to extract the information contained in <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>documents.</b> 1 Introduction <b>The</b> more extended way of acquiring information for knowledge-based systems is manually, frequently by means of a dialog between the system and the human expert (sometimes with the intervention of a knowledge engineer).

40|$|Problem statement: The {{main goal}} of a Web crawler is to collect {{documents}} {{that are relevant to}} a given topic in which the search engine specializes. These topic specific search systems typically take <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>document's</b> content in predicting the importance of an unvisited link. But current research had proven that the document's content pointed to by an unvisited link is mainly dependent on the anchor text, which is more accurate than predicting it on the contents of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> page. Approach: Between these two extremes, it was proposed that Treasure Graph, called T-Graph is a more effective way to guide the Web crawler to fetch topic specific documents predicted by identifying the topic boundary around the unvisited link and comparing that text with all the nodes of the T-Graph to obtain the matching node(s) and calculating the distance in the form of documents to be downloaded to reach the target documents. Results: Web search systems based on this strategy allowed crawlers and robots to update their experiences more rapidly and intelligently that can also offer speed of access and presentation advantages. Conclusion/Recommendations: The consequences of visiting a link to update a robot's experiences based on the principles and usage of T-Graph can be deployed as intelligent-knowledge Web crawlers as shown by the proposed novel Web search system architecture...|$|R
