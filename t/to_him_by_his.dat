In 1999, Coghill noted that he began using a 1970 Slingerland drum kit, citing that it had a better sound than a new kit, and was cheaper. Coghill uses Avedis Zildjian cymbals. He says that he has been offered sponsorship, but opted for older drums as a matter of preference. Despite this assertion, as of 2007 Coghill's name is mentioned in the Brady Drums artist roster.|$|E

Those interests in the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS began with medals given <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> father, including some taken from a dead German soldier. His most prized medal was his Knight's Cross, which he had bought from a Slayer fan for $1000. While touring with Motörhead, Hanneman discovered Motörhead vocalist Lemmy's {{interest in}} medals, and the two discussed medal designs, weapons and tactics used by the Wehrmacht.|$|E

It was during this time that Symeon had his first experience of God as divine light, as he described later {{in one of his}} Discourses (Disc. 22.2–4). He attributed the experience to the prayers of Symeon the Studite. In spite of the experience, the young Symeon confessed that he still fell into worldly ways of living. Direct personal experience of God was to become one of Symeon's central teachings in his writings, and to the monks who followed him.|$|E

5|$|A Hero's Song was Dvořák's last orchestral {{work and}} the final of his five symphonic poems, the others being The Water Goblin, The Noon Witch, The Golden Spinning Wheel, and The Wild Dove (Opp. 107–110). It is also the last {{instance}} of him writing purely instrumental music, as he dedicated himself to vocal and operatic works after its completion. He began working on the piece on August 4, 1897, immediately after revising the third act of his opera The Jacobin. The work was completed in three months, during which time Dvořák lived at his summer residence {{in his hometown of}} Příbram, and spent time at his chateau of the patron Josef Hlávka in Lužany. The piece was completed on October 25 of the same year, and was published in 1899 by Fritz Simrock in Berlin. The symphonic poem coincidentally anticipated Richard Strauss's similar tone poem Ein Heldenleben (A Hero's Life), which was composed a year later. In fact, Dvořák originally intended to title the piece A Hero's Life, a name which had been suggested <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> pupil Vítězslav Novák.|$|E
5|$|After The English Teacher, Narayan's {{writings}} {{took a more}} {{imaginative and}} creative external style compared to the semi-autobiographical tone of the earlier novels. His next effort, Mr. Sampath, was the first book exhibiting this modified approach. However, it still draws from {{some of his own}} experiences, particularly the aspect of starting his own journal; he also makes a marked movement away from his earlier novels by intermixing biographical events. Soon after, he published The Financial Expert, considered to be his masterpiece and hailed {{as one of the most}} original works of fiction in 1951. The inspiration for the novel was a true story about a financial genius, Margayya, related <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> brother. The next novel, Waiting for the Mahatma, loosely based on a fictional visit to Malgudi by Mahatma Gandhi, deals with the protagonist's romantic feelings for a woman, when he attends the discourses of the visiting Mahatma. The woman, named Bharti, is a loose parody of Bharati, the personification of India and the focus of Gandhi's discourses. While the novel includes significant references to the Indian independence movement, the focus is on the life of the ordinary individual, narrated with Narayan's usual dose of irony.|$|E

5|$|Erison Hurtault {{competed for}} Dominica in the men's 400meters dash. In Beijing, Hurtault {{was the only}} Dominican {{participating}} in the event. Born in Matawan, a New Jersey suburb of New York, and attending Columbia University, Hurtault initially tried out for the United States Olympic team, but failed to qualify, before taking the berth offered <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> parents' homeland. Hurtault was 23 {{at the time of}} his competition in Beijing, and had not previously competed in any Olympic games. During the 17 August qualification round, the Dominican-American athlete was placed in the fourth heat. He finished in fourth place with a time of 46.10seconds, displacing Uruguay's Andres Bayron Silva (46.32seconds) but falling behind Jamaica's Ricardo Chambers (45.22seconds). The leaders of Hurtault's heat included Great Britain's Martyn Rooney (45.00seconds) and Australia's Sean Wroe (45.17seconds). Overall, he ranked 34th out of the 55 athletes who completed the qualification round of the event. Hurtault did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|His feet {{position}} were peculiar in {{that his}} front foot was {{parallel to the}} crease and his back foot perpendicular, {{the opposite of the}} conventional posture. This inhibited his follow through and put more stress on his ankles and shins. As a result, his right ankle had to be bound tightly in order to prevent jarring from his awkward delivery. He also followed the recommendation of Bill O'Reilly and tied a towel around his shins to cut off the circulation and to dull the pain. After the knee injury, he altered his action into a more conventional one so that his front foot pointed towards the batsman. This eased the pressure on his body, but his ability to move the ball diminished. Johnston was a keen student of the game, and although he did not see a state match until his debut, and watched only one Test before his debut, he supplemented his knowledge by reading cricket books. During his early first-class career, upon returning from matches, he would read articles by Bradman, Bert Oldfield and Arthur Mailey from a book given <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> schoolteacher when he was a schoolboy.|$|E
5|$|His {{first study}} of {{mathematics}} began with papers by George Pólya {{and by the}} crystallographer Friedrich Haag on plane symmetry groups, sent <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> brother Berend, a geologist. He carefully studied the 17 wallpaper groups, and created periodic tilings with 43 drawings {{of different types of}} symmetry. From this point on he developed a mathematical approach to expressions of symmetry in his art works using his own notation. Starting in 1937, he created woodcuts based on the 17 groups. His Metamorphosis I (1937) began a series of designs that told a story through the use of pictures. In Metamorphosis I, he transformed convex polygons into regular patterns in a plane to form a human motif. He extended the approach in his piece Metamorphosis III, which is four metres long.|$|E

5|$|Charles Scott (April 1739– October 22, 1813) was an 18th-century American {{soldier who}} was elected the fourth {{governor}} of Kentucky in 1808. Orphaned at an early age, Scott enlisted in the Virginia Regiment in October 1755 {{and served as a}} scout and escort during the French and Indian War. He quickly rose through the ranks to become a captain. After the war, he married and engaged in agricultural pursuits on land left <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> father, but he returned to active military service in 1775 as the American Revolution began to grow in intensity. In August 1776, he was promoted to colonel and given command of the 5th Virginia Regiment. The 5th Virginia joined George Washington in New Jersey later that year, serving with him {{for the duration of the}} Philadelphia campaign. Scott commanded Washington's light infantry, and by late 1778 was also serving as his chief of intelligence. Furloughed at the end of the Philadelphia campaign, Scott returned to active service in March 1779 and was ordered to South Carolina to assist General Benjamin Lincoln in the southern theater. He arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, just as Henry Clinton had begun his siege of the city. Scott was taken as a prisoner of war when Charleston surrendered. Paroled in March 1781 and exchanged for Lord Rawdon in July 1782, Scott managed to complete a few recruiting assignments before the war ended.|$|E
