5|$|The {{interior}} of Chester Cathedral gives {{a warm and}} mellow appearance because of the pinkish colour of the sandstone. <b>The</b> <b>proportions</b> appear spacious because {{the view from the}} west end of the nave to the east end is unimpeded by a pulpitum and the nave, although not long, is both wide and high compared with many of England's cathedrals. The piers of the nave and choir are widely spaced, those of the nave carrying only the clerestory of large windows with no triforium gallery. <b>The</b> <b>proportions</b> are made possible partly because the ornate stellar vault, like that at York Minster, is of wood, not stone.|$|E

30|$|From the {{perspective}} of the composition of gross trade volume, we can find that <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of goods exports was much higher than that of services exports.

5|$|Fisher's {{desire for}} a shallow draught was not merely based {{on the need to}} allow for inshore operations; ships tended to operate closer to deep load than {{anticipated}} and were often found lacking in freeboard, reserve buoyancy and safety against underwater attack. This experience led the DNC to reconsider <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> of the hull to rectify the problems identified thus far. The Courageous-class ships were the first products of that re-evaluation.|$|E

This drawing employs the subtle sfumato technique of shading, {{in the manner of}} the Mona Lisa.

5|$|Food {{items include}} snails, worms, small crustaceans, flies and beetles. <b>The</b> <b>proportions</b> of each prey species vary with season and locality. Amphipod larvae are {{important}} in Ireland and Scotland, crustaceans in Norway, and the mollusc Assiminea grayana in the Netherlands. Small fish are occasionally eaten, and in hard weather pipits may scavenge for other food, including human food litter. There is little competition from other species for food, since rocky beach specialists like the purple sandpiper take slightly larger food items, and may wade in deeper water. When food is abundant, meadow pipits may also feed on the shore, but are driven away by the Eurasian rock pipits when there is less prey available.|$|E
5|$|Globular {{clusters}} normally {{consist of}} Population II stars, {{which have a}} low proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium when compared to Population I stars such as the Sun. Astronomers refer to these heavier elements as metals and to <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> of these elements as the metallicity. These elements are produced by stellar nucleosynthesis and then are recycled into the interstellar medium, where they enter {{the next generation of}} stars. Hence the proportion of metals can be an indication of the age of a star, with older stars typically having a lower metallicity.|$|E

40|$|The Domestic Violence Intervention Court Model was {{successful}} in achieving some {{but not all of}} its aims.   This study examines whether domestic violence police and court outcomes have changed since the commencement of the Domestic Violence Intervention Court Model (DVICM). Method: Logistic and Poisson regression models were used to determine whether the DVICM resulted in the following: an increase in <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of persons of interest charged with a domestic violence offence; an increase in <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of domestic violence matters finalised on a plea of guilty; a decrease in <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of matters finalised on a dismissal; an increase in <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of penalties of bonds with supervision; an increase in <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of penalties of imprisonment; a decrease in the time from first court appearance to finalisation in court; an increase in <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of matters finalised with a plea of guilty within three weeks of first court appearance; and an increase in <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of matters finalised within 12 weeks of the police event date. The test sites were Campbelltown, Macquarie Fields, and Wagga Wagga Local Area Commands. The rest of NSW was used as the control group. Results: The DVICM increased <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of persons of interest charged in Macquarie Fields but not in Campbelltown or Wagga Wagga Local Area Commands. It reduced the time taken to finalise domestic violence matters in Campbelltown and Wagga Wagga Local Courts. The DVICM did not affect <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of matters finalised on a plea of guilty; <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of matters finalised on a dismissal; <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of penalties of bonds with supervision; nor <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of penalties of imprisonment.

Examinations of the rapidly reproducing Epstein–Barr B-cells showed that the cells lost viability within minutes when exposed to pilosulin 1. Normal white blood cells were also found to alter easily when exposed to pilosulin 1. However, partial peptides of pilosulin 1 were less efficient at lowering {{cell viability}}; the residue 22 N-terminal plays a critical role in the cytotoxic activity of pilosulin 1.|$|E

5|$|There are {{theoretically}} {{no restrictions}} {{on where the}} ketogenic diet might be used, and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants.

5|$|A few Macroolithus eggs {{preserve}} embryonic {{remains of}} oviraptorids inside. Two eggs containing embryos {{found in the}} Upper Cretaceous Nanxiong Formation near Ganzhou, Jiangxi were referred to M. yaotunensis in 2008. One of these embryos shows a much greater degree of bone development (ossification) than the other; it preserves ossified hind limbs and several vertebrae. The fact that the cervical vertebrae not only have ossified centra and neural arches, but also have ossified zygapophyses, led Cheng et al. to conclude that this embryo may in fact represent a hatchling, since in modern chickens and skuas these zygaphyses are cartilaginous until hatching. Also, the embryo's foot anatomy (specifically, <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> of its metatarsals) resembles that of the oviraptorid Heyuannia huangi, indicating that these eggs belong to H. huangi or a similar species. The other egg has a much less developed embryo, with only the hind limbs preserved. While this does not permit comparison on the species level, the tibia (shinbone) confirms {{that it is an}} oviraptorosaur.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements {{in which a}} horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and training of the horse, and terrain and footing. <b>The</b> <b>proportions</b> and length of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E
