30|$|The {{bolted joints}} used in timber {{structures}} {{are subjected to}} forces in various directions <b>to</b> the wood <b>grain.</b> The shear strength of a bolted joint is significantly dependent on the loading direction <b>to</b> the <b>grain,</b> and Hankinson’s formula is recommended for calculating the shear strength for any loading direction <b>to</b> the <b>grain.</b> The shear strengths of bolted joints perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>grain</b> were mostly smaller than those parallel <b>to</b> the <b>grain,</b> {{and the difference between}} the latter and former varied according to the l/d ratio and kind of shear strength [19, 46]. The yield strengths of bolted joints perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>grain</b> with an l/d ratio of four showed 50 – 60  % lower values than those parallel <b>to</b> the <b>grain.</b> The loads at the proportional limit and the yield loads perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>grain</b> with l/d ratios of 8 – 12 showed 20 – 40  % lower values than those parallel <b>to</b> the <b>grain.</b> The difference in the maximum loads for different loading directions varied with the test method. The shear test methods for bolted joints perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>grain</b> were divided into tensile and bending loading types. The maximum loads perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>grain</b> with an l/d ratio of 8.6 obtained from tensile loading tests showed values that were about 75  % lower than those parallel <b>to</b> the <b>grain</b> [46]. When the ultimate loads of bolted joints perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>grain</b> were obtained from bending loading tests, those with an l/d ratio of four were about 15 – 25  % lower than those parallel <b>to</b> the <b>grain.</b> However, the ultimate loads perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>grain</b> with l/d ratios of 8 – 12 were almost the same or larger than those parallel <b>to</b> the <b>grain</b> [19].|$|R
30|$|Embedding tests {{parallel}} and perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>grain</b> {{were conducted}} <b>to</b> produce {{a database of}} embedding strength of wood {{for the design of}} dowel-type joints. Dowel diameters were 8, 12, 16, and 20 mm. Embedding strength was evaluated by the 5 % off-set method and a maximum load up to 5 mm displacement according to EN 383. The embedding strength parallel <b>to</b> the <b>grain</b> evaluated by the former method showed values close to those obtained with the latter method, but they showed a significant difference in tests conducted perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>grain.</b> The embedding strength parallel <b>to</b> the <b>grain</b> was 0.9 times as large as the compressive strength parallel <b>to</b> the <b>grain</b> regardless of the evaluation method. The embedding strength perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>grain</b> evaluated by the 5 % off-set method was four times as large as the compressive strength perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>grain.</b> When the embedding strength perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>grain</b> was evaluated by a maximum load up to 5 mm displacement according to EN 383, the ratio of embedding strength perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>grain</b> <b>to</b> the compressive strength perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>grain</b> decreased as the dowel diameter increased.|$|R

25|$|In {{response}} to the agricultural depression of the 1930s, the government encouraged domestic production by imposing tariffs on agricultural imports.

He attributed beriberi to a nerve poison in the endosperm of rice, from which the outer layers of the grain gave protection to the body. An associate, Gerrit Grijns (1865–1944), correctly interpreted the connection between excessive consumption of polished rice and beriberi in 1901: He concluded that rice contains an essential nutrient in the outer layers of the grain that is removed by polishing.|$|E
25|$|Early grain {{elevators}} and bins {{were often}} built of framed or cribbed wood, and were prone to fire.

When desired, silos, bins, and tanks are emptied by gravity flow, sweep augers, and conveyors. As grain is emptied from bins, tanks, and silos it is conveyed, blended, and weighted into trucks, railroad cars, or barges, and shipped <b>to</b> <b>grain</b> wholesalers, exporters, and/or local end-users, such as flour mills, breweries, and ethanol and alcohol distilleries.|$|E

Often, ownership was of less importance than in determining who had rights <b>to</b> <b>grain,</b> knight service, marriage penalties and the like. These duties were defined in the manner in which the land had been granted, and by whom in the feudal chain.

Households were permitted to purchase agricultural machinery and vehicles to transport goods to market. In {{order to ensure that}} rural units could cover the costs of the increasing quantities of industrial inputs required for higher yields, the government periodically reduced the prices of the industrial goods sold to farmers, while raising the procurement prices for agricultural products.

25|$|A few {{species are}} {{nuisance}} pests. Zabrus {{is one of}} the few herbivorous ground beetle genera, and on rare occasions Zabrus tenebrioides, for example, occurs abundantly enough to cause some damage <b>to</b> <b>grain</b> crops. Large species, usually Carabinae, can become a nuisance if present in numbers, particularly during outdoor activities such as camping; they void their defensive secretions when threatened, and in hiding among provisions their presence may spoil food. Since ground beetles are generally reluctant or even unable to fly, mechanically blocking their potential routes of entry is usually easy. The use of insecticides specifically for Carabid intrusion may lead to unfortunate side effects, such as the release of their repugnatorial secretions, so it generally is not a good idea unless the same applications are intended to exclude ants, parasites or other crawling pests.|$|E
25|$|Poverty {{continues}} to be strongly linked to food insecurity. As {{one of the poorest}} countries in the world, Burkina Faso has around 44.5% of its population living under the poverty line and ranked 183 out of 187countries on the UNDP Human Development Index in 2014. The Human Development Index is a measure of quality of life, taking into account three main areas of human development: longevity, education, and economic standard of living. These high levels of poverty found in Burkina Faso, combined with the soaring food prices of the global food crisis continue to contribute to Burkina Faso's issue of food insecurity. The global food crisis of 2007–2008 was a drastic surge in food prices that lead to high rates of hunger, malnutrition, and political and economic instability in nations across the globe. This strongly affected Burkina Faso because around 80% of Burkina's population is rural, relying on subsistence farming to make a living. For instance, when natural disasters such as floods, droughts, or locust attacks occur and cause crops to fail, farmers in Burkina Faso become dependent on grain purchases. Because of the global food crisis, local grain prices dramatically increased, limiting farmers' access <b>to</b> <b>grain</b> through market exchanges.|$|E
