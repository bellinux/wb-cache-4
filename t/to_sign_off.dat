5|$|By 5 May 1536, {{the town}} council of Buena Esperanza had now lost all faith in Cerezeda and {{voted for the}} {{abandonment}} of Higueras {{and a return to}} Trujillo; Cerezeda opposed this decision, but the council forced him <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>off</b> on the move. In the meantime, any party foraging outside of Buena Esperanza was ordered to consist of at least 20 members for defence from the hostile natives. A chaotic evacuation back to Trujillo began, and resentment against Cerezeda was such that he feared for his life and fled to Naco to seek refuge amongst friendly natives there. On 9 May, amidst this disordered Spanish retreat, García de Celís returned from Guatemala with news that help would soon be forthcoming.|$|E

5|$|New {{regulations}} {{in response to}} the scandals include the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 2004 in Australia as well as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, developed by the United States. Sarbanes-Oxley limits the level of work which can be carried out by accounting firms. In addition, the Act put a limit on the fee which a firm can receive from one client as a percentage of their total fees. This ensures that companies are not wholly reliant on one firm for its income, in the hope that they do not need to act unethically to keep a steady income. The act also protects whistleblowers and requires senior management in public companies <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>off</b> on the accuracy of its company's accounting records. In 2002, the five members of the Public Oversight Board (POB), which oversaw ethics within the accounting profession, resigned after critics deemed the board ineffective and the SEC proposed developing a new panel, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The PCAOB was developed through the Act, and replaced the POB.|$|E
5|$|During its {{existence}} the King's Bench's jurisdiction initially covered {{a wide range}} of criminal matters, something significantly reduced later on, along with any business not claimed by the other courts, and any cases which concerned the monarch. It also acted as a court of appeal for the Exchequer of Pleas and Common Pleas, although it was not a court of last resort and required Parliament <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>off</b> on its decisions. The creation of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in 1585 created a court from which King's Bench decisions could be appealed to, and with the expansion of the Exchequer Chamber's jurisdiction in 1830 the King's Bench ceased to be an appellate court. Thanks to the Bill of Westminster and other legal fictions, the King's Bench gained much of the Common Pleas's jurisdiction, although the Common Pleas remained the sole place where real property claims could be brought. The King's Bench was staffed by one Chief Justice, now the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, and a variable number of Puisne Justices; normally three, there were five serving when the King's Bench was dissolved. Those who chose not to retire became Justices of the High Court on the King's Bench's dissolution.|$|E

Blatnick and McCarthy traveled around the country, educating regulators and changing perceptions about a sport that {{was thought to be}} bloodthirsty and inhumane. By April 2000, their movement had clearly made an impact. California was set to become the first state in the U.S. <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>off</b> on a set of codified rules that governed MMA.

30|$|The new special skills module {{beginning}} in August 2007 specifies the {{minimum number of}} cases that should ideally be performed in each procedure for a trainee <b>to</b> be <b>signed</b> as competent (Fig.  2). Ideally, a person should perform over 20 polypectomies, over 10 transcervical endometrial resection of endometrium (TCRE) first-generation procedures, over 10  second-generation TCRE procedures and over 15 submucous fibroid resections, giving an overall of over 50 operative hysteroscopy procedures. As with regards to diagnostic hysteroscopy procedures, the minimum number of cases that a trainee needs to carry out in order <b>to</b> be <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> as competent is 50. So, assuming that a trainee performs the minimum number of operative and diagnostic hysteroscopy cases necessary to pass the module, {{he would need to}} carry out over 55 operative hysteroscopy cases and over 50 diagnostic hysteroscopy cases, i.e. the ratio of operative to diagnostic hysteroscopies would be 55 to 50, which is equivalent to 53 % operative and 47 % diagnostic. The results of the survey suggest that the average trainee performs 72.2 % diagnostic hysteroscopy in comparison to only 27.8 % operative hysteroscopy. This would suggest that, although the trainees may find it easy <b>to</b> be <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> as competent in diagnostic hysteroscopy, they would struggle in getting <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> as being competent in operative hysteroscopy in one year.|$|R
25|$|A {{report by}} Jon Heyman listed the sale price at $570 million.

The reported gap between creditors demands and payment offered by HSG was $270 million and $300 million and would have been resolved if the amount Hicks was to receive from the land sale was lowered to increase the creditors for the debt. MLB's commissioner, Bud Selig, expressed his interest in the deal being approved by the creditors no later than April 9, 2010, and indicated that MLB could become more directly involved in the sale process.|$|E
25|$|Planned content {{begins with}} the creative/marketing team {{generating}} their ideas, once they have completed their ideas they send them off for approval. There is two general ways of doing so. The first is where each sector approves the plan one after another, editor, brand, followed by the legal team (Brito, 2013). Sectors may differ {{depending on the size}} and philosophy of the business. The second is where each sector is given 24 hours (or such designated time) <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>off</b> or disapprove. If no action is given within the 24-hour period the original plan is implemented. Planned content is often noticeable to customers and is un-original or lacks excitement but is also a safer option to avoid unnecessary backlash from the public. Both routes for planned content are time consuming as in the above; the first way to approval takes 72 hours to be approved. Although the second route can be significantly shorter it also holds more risk particularly in the legal department.|$|E
25|$|Sergius {{sought to}} create a formula that {{would be able to}} fully please both the Chalcedonians and the Monophysites. The {{eventually}} forbade discussion on whether Christ had one or two energies within him and instead insisted that the Lord had two different natures incarnated within a single will and body. Sergious would lead to call this statement the Ecthesis, or Exposition. These beliefs were in similar accordance to the beliefs of Hominus. This furthered Sergius’ formula in realms of both Chalcedonian and Monophysite practice. It can be argued that Hominus did not quite understand the point of Sergius’ formula, but it is accepted that he supported it regardless. Still, the Ecthesis was not well received by all Chalcedonians; Sophronius viewed it poorly, to the point that he published a decree against it. Emperor Heraclius too was hesitant <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>off</b> on Sergious’ work. While Sergius had finished the Ecthesis in 636, it was not signed into approval by Heraclius until 638, the same year as Sergius’ death.|$|E
