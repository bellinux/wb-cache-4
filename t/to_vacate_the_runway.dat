25|$|The AETs {{final report}} into the {{incident}} was released on 10 December 2012. The report revealed {{that the cause of}} {{the incident was}} errors by Air Traffic Control (ATC). The van had been instructed <b>to</b> <b>vacate</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> but ATC had failed to confirm that the instruction had been received and executed before giving the aircraft permission to land. The van and aircraft were using different radio frequencies and therefore each was unaware of the other. A failure to use standard radio phraseology was found to have been a contributory factor in the incident. The van had been seen by the crew just before they landed but it was assessed that a collision would still have occurred had a go-around been initiated. Twelve recommendations were made in the AETs final report. These included the installation of equipment that was capable of recording ATC communications with at least the previous 24 hours recordings being retained.|$|E
50|$|Busy {{airports}} typically construct high-speed or rapid-exit taxiways {{to allow}} aircraft {{to leave the}} runway at higher speeds. This allows the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>vacate</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> quicker, permitting another to land or take off in a shorter interval of time. This is usually accomplished by making the exiting taxiway longer, thus giving the aircraft more space in which to slow down, before the taxiways' upcoming intersection with another (perpendicular) taxiway, another runway, or the ramp/tarmac.|$|E
5000|$|The {{headwind}} {{reduces the}} landing distance for an aircraft. Landing into a headwind reduces the Ground Speed (GS) {{for the same}} TAS. [...] This is beneficial to pilots as well as Air traffic controllers (ATC). An aircraft landing into a headwind will require less runway and will be able <b>to</b> <b>vacate</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> sooner. If the headwind decreases near the ground, there's {{a decrease in the}} performance of the aircraft and it will tend to sink and possibly under shoot the aiming point.Tailwind increases the Ground Speed of an aircraft for the same TAS and thus a longer runway distance will be required for an aircraft to land. Landing in a tailwind situation could lead to the aircraft over shooting the runway and colliding with objects or terrain.|$|E
