40|$|In this paper, the {{aerodynamics}} of two {{vertical axis}} wind turbines (VAWTs) are discussed, {{on the basis}} of a wide set of experiments performed at Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy. A H-shaped and a <b>Troposkien</b> Darrieus turbine for microgeneration, featuring the same swept area and blade section, are tested at full-scale. Performance measurements show that the <b>Troposkien</b> rotor outperforms the H-shaped turbine, thanks to the larger midspan section of the <b>Troposkien</b> rotor and to the nonaerodynamic struts of the H-shaped rotor. These features are consistent with the character of the wakes shed by the turbines, measured by means of hot wire anemometry on several surfaces downstream of the models. The H-shape and <b>Troposkien</b> turbine wakes exhibit relevant differences in the three-dimensional morphology and unsteady evolution. In particular, large-scale vortices dominate the tip region of the wake shed by the H-shape turbine; these vortices pulsate significantly during the period, due to the periodic fluctuation of the blade aerodynamic loading. Conversely, the highly tapered shape of the <b>Troposkien</b> rotor not only prevents the onset of tip vortices, but also induces a dramatic spanwise reduction of tip speed ratio (TSR), promoting the onset of local dynamic stall marked by high periodic and turbulent unsteadiness in the tip region of the wake. The way in which these mechanisms affect the wake evolution and mixing process for the two classes of turbines is investigated for different tip speed ratios, highlighting some relevant implications in the framework of wind energy exploitation...|$|E

A Hshaped and a <b>Troposkien</b> Darrieus turbine for micro-generation, characterized by the same swept area and blade section, are tested in real-scale. Performance measurements show that the <b>Troposkien</b> rotor outperforms the H-shaped turbine, mostly related to the larger midspan section of the <b>Troposkien</b> rotor (resulting by the constraint of constant swept area) and to the nonaerodynamic struts of the H-shaped rotor. These features are consistent with the character of the wakes shed by the turbines, measured by means of hot wire anemometry on several surfaces downstream of the models. The morphology of H-shape and <b>Troposkien</b> rotor wakes exhibit relevant differences, especially in the three-dimensional character and time-periodic evolution in the blade tip region. In particular, large-scale vortices dominate the tip region of the wake shed by the H-shape turbine; these vortices pulsate significantly during the period, due to the periodic fluctuation of the blade aerodynamic loading.

Five rotor blade architectures, characterized by a constant value of the thickness-to-chord ratio and a varying chord length along the blade span, are evaluated. The optimization process is conducted with respect to the power coefficient for a target wind speed of 9 m/s, obtaining a consistent improvement of rotor performance with respect to the baseline blade configuration...|$|E
40|$|The {{derivation}} {{of dynamic}} differential equations, suitable {{for studying the}} vibrations of rotating, curved, slender structures was examined, and the Hamiltonian procedure was advocated for this purpose. Various reductions of the full system are displayed, which govern the vibrating <b>troposkien</b> when various order of magnitude restrictions are placed on important parameters. Possible advantages of the WKB asymptotic method for solving these classes of problems are discussed. A special case of this method is used illustratively to calculate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for a flat turbine blade with small flexural stiffness...|$|E

Twelve international partners developed a Darrieus type floating turbine with new materials and technologies for deep-sea offshore environment. This paper summarizes results of the 5 MW DeepWind conceptual design. The concept was evaluated at the Hywind test site, described on its few components, in particular on the modified <b>Troposkien</b> blade shape and airfoil design. The feasibility of upscaling from 5 MW to 20 MW is discussed, {{taking into account the}} results from testing the Deepwind floating 1 kW demonstrator. The 5 MW simulation results, loading and performance are compared to the OC 3 -NREL 5 MW wind turbine. Finally the paper elaborates the conceptual design on cost modelling...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{aerodynamic}} benchmarking for the DeepWind rotor {{is conducted}} comparing different rotor geometries and solutions {{and keeping the}} comparison as fair as possible. The objective for the benchmarking {{is to find the}} most suitable configuration in order to maximize the power production and minimize the blade solicitation and the cost of energy. Different parameters are considered for the benchmarking study. The DeepWind blade is characterized by a shape similar to the <b>Troposkien</b> geometry but asymmetric between the top and bottom parts: this shape is considered as a fixed parameter in the benchmarking process. The number of blades in the analysis is varied from 1 to 4. In order to keep the comparison fair among the different configurations, the solidity is kept constant and, therefore, the chord length reduced.

40|$|This Thesis {{focuses on}} the aero-structural {{simulation}} and optimization of Darrieus Vertical Axis Wind Turbines. Aerodynamic simulation tools based on different techniques are developed, improved with respect to state-of-art tools, and validated against experimental data. The main considered approaches {{are based on the}} Blade Element Momentum, Vortex, two- and three-dimensional Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models. The models are developed keeping in mind the final coupling with an optimization algorithm, therefore with particular emphasis on the computational effort and simulation robustness. A structural simulation tool based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is also developed and validated against experimental data to perform an efficient aero-structural simulation. The validated models are coupled with an optimization algorithm under certain constraints to create an iterative loop able to produce improved designs. Different applications are considered based on the most relevant research topics and real case scenarios. The particular case of a floating <b>Troposkien</b> Vertical Axis Wind Turbine is analysed by improving the baseline aerodynamic design for the 5 MW rotor developed in the FP 7 DeepWind project and evaluating the aerodynamic performance under rotor tilted conditions for the 1 kW demonstrator. The airfoil shape for the blade of a 500 kW H-rotor is also subjected to an optimization analysis with the aim to increase the aerodynamic production, obtaining a new geometry different from literature design. Finally, the aerodynamic and structural simulation tools are coupled to perform a complete aero-structural optimization of blade shape and chord distribution for a 500 kW <b>Troposkien</b> rotor. Both aerodynamic production and rotor stress are targeted in the routine and new blade shapes are found and discussed. The Thesis results, beside the increased performance with respect to the baseline case, prove that iterative loops, obtained by coupling a fast simulation tool and an optimization algorithm, can be adopted in the design and test phase of Darrieus Vertical Axis Wind Turbines, by providing the designer an advanced insight on the aerodynamic and structural phenomena experienced by these complex machines...|$|E
40|$|The Betz {{theory for}} optimal {{performance}} of wind turbines {{requires that the}} momentum of the flow through a rotor should be reduced by two-thirds of the upstream value by its passage through the rotor. Strictly this should apply to all points. But as there is a strong reduction in velocity towards the hub of horizontal-axis machines, a compromise has to be reached with respect to higher chords and increased pitch angles near the hub. The same momentum requirements apply to vertical-axis machines where the problem is the change of relative velocity across the window. Folowing Strickland’s stream-tube analysis used for the Darieus <b>troposkien</b> rotors, this paper wil give a method for calculating the correct pitch angles for a vertical-axis, variable-pitch rotor with straight blades aimed at the generation of energy from marine currents, tidal streams and very low-head hydro sites. Productivity analysis based on lift and drag forces round the circumference of the turbine shows that the performance coefficient of a variable pitch machine with momentum control can equal that of a horizontal-axis one...|$|E
40|$|An {{aerodynamic}} {{improvement of}} the DeepWind rotor is conducted adopting different rotor geometries and solutions {{with respect to the}} original configuration while keeping the comparison as fair as possible. The objective of this work is to find the most suitable configuration in order to maximize the power production and minimize the blade stress and the cost of energy. Different parameters are considered for the study. The DeepWind blade is characterized by a shape similar to the <b>Troposkien</b> geometry but asymmetric between the top and bottom parts. The blade shape is considered as a fixed parameter in the optimization process and, because of different blade element radii, it will experience different tip speed ratios in the same operational condition. This leads to a complex optimization problem, which must be carefully analyzed in order to find the most suitable parameter set. The number of blades in the analysis is varied from 1 to 4. In order to keep the comparison fair among the different configurations, the solidity is kept constant and, therefore, the chord length reduced. A second comparison is conducted by considering different blade profiles belonging to the symmetric NACA airfoil family. Finally, a chord optimization along the blade span is conducted, in order to find the optimal chord distribution to maximize the power production...|$|E
40|$|The DeepWind Project aims at {{investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} a new floating vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) concept, whose purpose is to exploit wind resources at deep-water offshore sites. The results of an extensive experimental campaign on the DeepWind reduced scale demonstrator are here presented for different wind speeds and rotor angular velocities, including also skewed flow operation due to a tilted rotor arrangement. To accomplish this, after being instrumented to measure aerodynamic power and thrust (both in streamwise and transversal directions), a <b>troposkien</b> three-bladed rotor was installed on a high precision test bench, whose axis was suitable to be inclined up to 15 ° {{with respect to the}} design (i. e. upright) operating condition. The experiments were performed at the large scale, high speed wind tunnel of the Politecnico di Milano (Italy), using a "free jet" (open channel) configuration. The velocity field {{in the wake of the}} rotor was also fully characterized by means of an instrumented traversing system, to investigate the flow distribution downstream of the test section. Special care is taken in the description of the experimental set-up and of the measured data, so that the present results can be used as a benchmark for the validation of simulation models...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of {{the wake of a}} wind turbine contributes significantly to its operation and performance, as well as to those of machines installed in the vicinity. The inherent unsteady and three-dimensional aerodynamics of Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT) have hitherto limited the research on wake evolution. In this paper the wakes of both a <b>troposkien</b> and a H-type VAWT rotor are investigated by comparing experiments and calculations. Experiments were carried out in the large-scale wind tunnel of the Politecnico di Milano, where unsteady velocity measurements in the wake were performed by means of hot wire anemometry. The geometry of the rotors was reconstructed in the open-source wind-turbine software QBlade, developed at the TU Berlin. The aerodynamic model makes use of a lifting line free-vortex wake (LLFVW) formulation, including an adapted Beddoes-Leishman unsteady aerodynamic model; airfoil polars are introduced to assign sectional lift and drag coefficients. A wake sensitivity analysis was carried out to maximize the reliability of wake predictions. The calculations are shown to reproduce several wake features observed in the experiments, including blade-tip vortex, dominant and submissive vortical structures, and periodic unsteadiness caused by sectional dynamic stall. The experimental assessment of the simulations illustrates that the LLFVW model is capable of predicting the unsteady wake development with very limited computational cost, thus making the model ideal for the design and optimization of VAWTs...|$|E
40|$|There is renewed {{interest}} in aerodynamics research of VAWT rotors. Lift type, Darrieus designs sometimes use flexed blades to have an ’egg-beater shape’ with an optimum <b>Troposkien</b> geometry to minimize the structural stress on the blades. While straight bladed VAWTs have been investigated in depth through both measurements and numerical modelling, the aerodynamics of flexed blades has not been researched with {{the same level of}} detail. Two major effects may have a substantial impact on blade performance. First, flexing at the equator causes relatively strong trailing vorticity to be released. Secondly, the blade performance at each station along the blade is influenced by self-induced velocities due to bound vorticity. The latter is not present in a straight bladed configuration. The aim of this research is to investigate these effects in relation to an innovative 4 kW wind turbine concept being developed in collaboration with industry known as a self-adjusting VAWT (or SATVAWT). The approach used in this study is based on experimental and numerical work. A lifting line free-wake vortex model was developed. Wind tunnel power and hot-wire velocity measurements were performed on a scaled down, 60 cm high, three bladed model in a closed wind tunnel. Results show a substantial axial wake induction at the equator resulting in a lower power generation at this position. This induction increases with increasing degree of flexure. The self-induced velocities caused by blade bound vorticity at a particular station was found to be relatively small. peer-reviewe...|$|E
