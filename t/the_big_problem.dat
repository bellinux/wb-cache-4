500|$|Burton hired Wesley Strick {{to do an}} uncredited rewrite. Strick recalled, [...] "When I {{was hired}} to write Batman Returns (Batman II at the time), <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> of the script was Penguin's lack of a 'master plan'." [...] Warner Bros. {{presented}} Strick with warming, or freezing Gotham City, a plot point they would later use in Batman & Robin. Strick gained inspiration from a Moses parallel that had Penguin killing the firstborn sons of Gotham. A similar notion was used when the Penguin's parents threw him into a river as a baby. Robin appeared in the script, but was deleted because Waters felt the film had too many characters. Waters called Robin [...] "the most worthless character in the world, especially with [...] the loner of loners." [...] Robin {{started out as a}} juvenile gang leader, who becomes an ally to Batman. Robin was later changed to a black teenage garage mechanic. Waters explained, [...] "He's wearing this old-fashioned garage mechanic uniform and it has an 'R' on it. He drives the Batmobile, which I notice they used in the third film!" [...] Marlon Wayans was cast, and signed for a sequel. The actor had attended a wardrobe fitting, but it was decided to save the character for a third installment.|$|E

[...] He suggests that NASA sent robot missions because radiation levels in outer space would be deadly. Another variant on this is the idea that NASA and its contractors did not recover quickly enough from the Apollo 1 fire, and so all the early Apollo missions were faked, with Apollos 14 or 15 being the first real mission.|$|E

A review from Outlook India noted that, [...] " [...] the show might well heighten awareness, enable the efforts of those doing real work at the ground level, and get the issue out of the denial closet, [...] But {{it is a little}} {{unrealistic}} to expect a film star and a TV show to change the world." [...] Subhash Jha from The Times of India commented on the show, [...] "...though brave and thought provoking, was disappointing in its lack of genuine connectivity between the host and the victims of social atrocity.

2500|$|Finnish parliamentarian Kimmo Kiljunen, {{the deputy}} {{president}} of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly {{and a member of}} its election monitoring mission in Russia, questioned the accuracy of the reported Chechen election results in an interview to a Russian radio station, saying that it is [...] "impossible that all voters come and vote for one and the same party." [...] Commenting on his personal experience of observing about 10 polling stations, he said [...] "my general point is that in principle what happened yesterday were normal elections and in technical sense they worked well." [...] He also said, [...] "And there's one specific aspect that is also problematic: the executive branch has made the election so that they almost chose this Parliament [...] And this is a problem. [...] Government forces have been blended with the party base. And it is a very problematic situation that the president will be a candidate for one party, and will not {{be a member of the}} council, as well as governors of various regions who were candidates of one party - and will not be members of the Duma. This party political interference, and this is my own opinion, is <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>problem.</b> I will say the election was made in a Russian style — I can't say whether democratic or not — I can't analyze it in this aspect". Commenting a statement by the host that [...] "the president had a formal right to head the list of one of the parties" [...] he said [...] "I also think so. You didn't do it against your law. [...] I think the president has the right to be a candidate, the governor has the right to be a candidate - I'm not criticizing it, I just ask - how is this possible?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately for loyal Oldsmobile customers, GM {{management}} on Woodward Avenue in Detroit were {{focusing on}} cost savings per vehicle by this time, a philosophy later called [...] "less car for more money" [...] by the 1970s. [...] One drawback of this thinking {{was that the}} 1961 through 1964 Oldsmobiles lost their dependable (but expensive to build) Jetaway Hydramatic transmissions. [...] Replacing those time-tested four speed units was a much cheaper to build three speed unit, the Roto Hydramatic. [...] This transmission had no front fluid coupling at all, and utilized a single [...] "fill-and-dump" [...] coupling to perform double duty as both a fluid coupling in third speed while having a third reaction member, which Olds called an [...] "Accel-O-Rotor," [...] which was actually a small stator, thus giving some limited torque multiplication in first. [...] In theory, the [...] "Accel-O-Rotor" [...] would provide the same multiplication range in first as both {{the first and second}} gears of the four speed unit without all the hardware...and cost. [...] It was also unique at that time, in that second speed was pure mechanical connection from engine to rear end...no fluid coupling involved. [...] <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> with this unit in the Oldsmobiles (and lower line Pontiacs of the same era) was engine speed would race wildly in first, and then hit a [...] "brick wall" [...] of a very steep RPM decline in second, which was equivalent to third gear in the four speed Jetaway Hydramatic. [...] This unit was very trouble prone and unreliable, and cost a great deal of performance otherwise obtainable from the Rocket. [...] It would linger for only these three years, when it was replaced by the much more reliable, but less efficient, Turbo Hydramatic in 1965. [...] Customer complaints caused many dealers and independent transmission shops to wholesale replace the Roto Hydramatic in these cars with older (or contemporary, from a Pontiac Star Chief or Bonneville) HM315 four speed Hydramatic.|$|E
