25|$|Cases, {{especially}} bottleneck cases, will stretch upon firing. How much a {{case will}} stretch depends upon load pressure, cartridge design, chamber size, functional cartridge headspace (usually {{the most important}} factor), and other variables. Periodically cases need to be trimmed {{to bring them back}} into proper specifications. Most reloading manuals list both a <b>trim</b> <b>size</b> and a max length. Long cases can create a safety hazard through improper headspace and possible increased pressure.|$|E
25|$|Life slashed {{advertising}} prices 34 {{percent in a}} bid to make the monthly publication more appealing to advertisers. The magazine reduced its circulation guarantee for advertisers by 12 percent in July 1993 to 1.5 million copies from the current 1.7 million. The publishers in this era were Nora McAniff and Edward McCarrick; Daniel Okrent was the editor. LIFE for the first time was the same <b>trim</b> <b>size</b> as its longtime Time Inc. sister publication, Fortune.|$|E
500|$|The {{magazine}} is oversized {{to be as}} large as would fit within the fold of The Wall Street Journal. Its specs are [...] <b>trim</b> <b>size</b> and a 50-50 ad-to-edit ratio on a [...] paper stock. [...] The premiere issue of WSJ. had 104 pages in the U.S. and 80 pages in the Europe and Asia editions. It included 51 advertisers of which 19 are new to The Wall Street Journal franchise. The initial cover featured Diana Dondoe in a dress fabricated from The Wall Street Journal newsprint design, which the New York Observer feels is a tip of the hat to a controversy noted in the New York Times about a poverty chic photo spread in the India edition of the August 2008 Vogue.|$|E

5000|$|Modern wallcoverings are diverse, {{and what}} is {{described}} as wallpaper may no longer actually be made from paper. Two {{of the most common}} factory <b>trimmed</b> <b>sizes</b> of wallpaper are referred to as [...] "American" [...] and [...] "European" [...] rolled goods. American rolled goods are 27 inches by 27 ft in length. European rolled goods are 21.5 inches wide by 33 ft in length. Approx. 60 sq ft. Most wallpaper borders are sold by linear foot and {{with a wide range of}} widths therefore square footage is not applicable. Although some may require trimming.|$|R
50|$|In 2007 the {{interior}} {{layout of the}} devotions was changed, the first {{significant change in the}} layout since its inception. In 2008 the <b>trim</b> <b>size</b> changed to 4+1/8 x 6+1/2 in from its former 4 x 6 in size to accommodate changes in printing technology.|$|E
50|$|All hardcovers {{contain the}} {{contents}} of the comics, including the covers, and in some cases bonus material. The books' <b>trim</b> <b>size</b> is larger than the paperbacks. Each hardcover contains two story arcs from the series. Signed versions of the books are available, each limited to 310 pieces.|$|E
5000|$|The binding cloth is durable woven rayon. The {{books are}} Smyth-sewn for {{permanence}} and flexibility, and each includes a ribbon marker. Each volume has an identical <b>trim</b> <b>size,</b> {{based on the}} [...] "golden section," [...] which the ancient Greeks {{considered to be the}} ideal proportion. Each volume contains 700 to 1600 pages.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the typical}} [...] "direct print" [...] method, the plate is inked, the thin paper (dampened) {{is placed on}} the inked plate and <b>trimmed</b> to <b>size,</b> paste is applied to the thin paper, and the {{ensemble}} (plate plus thin paper with paste) is placed on a dampened backing sheet. This is then run through a printing press. In the pressure of the press, the ink is transferred to the thin paper, and the thinner paper is simultaneously adhered to the backing paper. An advantage of this method is that the thin paper will be exactly the desired size, since it is <b>trimmed</b> to <b>size</b> and then quickly affixed in place.|$|R
5000|$|Outside of North America, Letter size {{may also}} be known as [...] "American Quarto". If one accepts some <b>trimming,</b> the <b>size</b> is indeed {{one quarter of the}} old Imperial paper size known as Demy, 17+1/ 2 × 22+1/ 2 in.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to having little introductory/orientation material (every NFT simply begins with an introductory letter, a table of contents, and then a map of each neighborhood for that city), NFT differs from other guides in that its <b>trim</b> <b>size</b> is variable—the New York City guide is pocket-sized, while the Los Angeles guide is quite larger as {{it is meant to}} be used as a driving/navigational tool in {{addition to}} a basic reference. Cities such as Chicago and Washington, DC have a <b>trim</b> <b>size</b> that is in between that of the pocket guides and the larger Los Angeles guide. NFT states that each of its guides' sizes is based solely on the [...] "coverage area" [...] for each city—San Francisco being close to 50 sq mi, for instance, and Los Angeles covering close to 500 sq mi. Los Angeles has five times the population of San Francisco.|$|E
50|$|Casting off {{generally}} {{begins by}} counting the words or {{characters in the}} manuscript, usually using a word processor or text editor. This word count is then divided by {{an estimate of the}} number of words or characters per full page of a model book, i.e., a previously published book with approximately the same <b>trim</b> <b>size</b> and type specifications to be applied to the manuscript.|$|E

5000|$|Starting in 1957-58, Parkies went head to {{head with}} O-Pee-Chee hockey cards (produced in {{conjunction}} with Topps Chewing Gum). The Parkies hockey series still featured just the two Canadian teams, while the O-Pee-Chee/Topps series featured the NHL's four American teams. Parkies established a new, slightly <b>trimmer</b> card <b>size</b> of 61.9 mm x 92.1 mm; O-Pee-Chee used the newly established Topps standard size of 63.5 mm x 88.9 mm (2.5" [...] x 3.5").|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of pages in desktop publishing, {{electronic}} pages and virtual paper pages to be printed on physical paper pages. All computerized documents are technically electronic, which are limited in size only by computer memory or computer data storage space. Virtual paper pages will ultimately be printed, and therefore require paper parameters that coincide with international standard physical paper sizes such as [...] "A4, [...] " [...] "letter, [...] " [...] etc., if not custom <b>sizes</b> for <b>trimming.</b> Some desktop publishing programs allow custom sizes designated for large format printing used in posters, billboards and trade show displays. A virtual page for printing has a predesignated size of virtual printing material and can be viewed on a monitor in WYSIWYG format. Each page for printing has <b>trim</b> <b>sizes</b> (edge of paper) and a printable area if bleed printing is not possible {{as is the case with}} most desktop printers. A web page is an example of an electronic page that is not constrained by virtual paper parameters. Most electronic pages may be dynamically re-sized, causing either the content to scale in size with the page or causing the content to re-flow.|$|R

5000|$|The books, {{printed in}} a uniform <b>trim</b> <b>size</b> and {{designed}} by Tae Won Yu, were distributed primarily by subscription. [...] "We ship a book out of the warehouse if we feel confident that it will reach a reader," [...] Stadler continued.

50|$|After {{the image}} is printed, the canvas is <b>trimmed</b> to <b>size</b> and glued, or stapled to {{traditional}} stretcher bars, or a wooden panel and displayed in a frame, or as a gallery wrap. The frames are usually constructed from solid pine and underpinned for added strength. A print {{that is designed to}} continue round the edges of a stretcher frame once gallery-wrapped is referred to as full-bleed. This can be used to enhance the three-dimensional effect of the mounted print.|$|R

50|$|This {{important}} {{document was}} initially {{written in the}} format of scrolls, like verdicts and petitions used to be. It lacks bismillah at the beginning {{as well as the}} names of the sender and receiver, which in an official correspondence could only indicate that the heading and footing were damaged in the course of time and therefore <b>trimmed.</b> The <b>size</b> of the petition was basically one zar‘ (canonical cubit) long, which is 49.879 cm, meaning that the ʿArżeh-dāsht has lost approximately 4 cm of its initial length.|$|R
50|$|Quill & Quire was {{substantially}} redesigned in 2006 in {{an effort}} led by publisher Alison Jones, editor Derek Weiler and art director Gary Campbell. One of the chief aims of the redesign was to demonstrate to the book and magazine industries the viability of printing on 100% recycled, environmentally-friendly paper stock. (It {{was one of the}} first magazines in Canada to do so.) As part of the process, the magazines <b>trim</b> <b>size</b> was reduced for the first time in 30 years, from a large tabloid newspaper size (11” x 14”) to that of a standard magazine. This also marked the first time the magazine was printed entirely in colour. The debut redesign issue (January 2006) featured author and artist Douglas Coupland on the cover.|$|E
5000|$|Cultural {{anthropologist}} Matt Thorn praised Stu Levy {{for opening}} up an untapped market for cartoons {{with the publication}} of Sailor Moon. Before Sailor Moon, the belief among entertainment executives was that [...] "girls don't watch cartoons." [...] Due to Sailor Moon’s immense popularity, Tokyopop discontinued the serial from its magazines, and released it separately as its first manga graphic novel. They engineered prominent book distribution via retail stores, standardized book <b>trim</b> <b>size,</b> created a basic industry-wide rating system, and developed the first-ever retail manga displays and introduced the world of graphic novels to an audience of teenage girls. Also, together with Diamond, Tokyopop offered retailers free spinner rack displays for Tokyopop manga, thereby increasing the visibility of the medium in bookstores.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} verifying if beak-trimming methods in Japanese quail pullets could {{optimize}} production by decreasing stress caused by cannibalism. A {{total number of}} 816 day-old Japanese quails was distributed in a completely randomized experimental design in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement, with two beak-trimming ages (14 and 21 days of age) and three beak-trimming <b>sizes</b> (not <b>trimmed,</b> 1 / 3 trimmed, or 1 / 2 trimmed), and 4 replicates of 34 birds per replicate. Birds were submitted to the same management and feeding conditions. Weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, and mortality were evaluated. There was no significant effect of age at beak trimming on the evaluated parameters (P> 0. 05), as well as no significant interaction between age at beak trimming, and beak-trimming method. There was a significant effect (P< 0. 01) of <b>trimming</b> <b>size</b> on performance, with the best performance observed in birds not submitted to beak trimming or had 1 / 2 of the beak trimmed. When the beak was more aggressively trimmed (1 / 2), parameters were worse. According to the obtained results, it is recommended to trim 1 / 3 of the beaks, which can be performed either at 14 or 21 days of age...|$|R
