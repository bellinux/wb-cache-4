500|$|Concerns {{over the}} animals' safety {{prompted}} an anonymous telephone {{call to the}} Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), which dispatched a representative. Initial tests with shocking had yielded disappointing results, necessitating an increase in voltage. According to Anderson, [...] "Meddings explained that his team were laying the crocodiles down and they weren't doing anything. They were just lying there. The RSPCA man said, well, they would, because of {{the warmth of the}} lamps. So Derek said, 'We've been giving them a touch with an electrode just to make them move.' The guy asked what voltage they were using and Derek said it was about 20 volts, and <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>said,</b> 'Oh, they've got terribly thick skins, you know. If you want them to move, you'll have to pump it up to 60.'" [...] Following an initial investigation of AP Films Studios, the allegations of mistreatment were not pursued further; the RSPCA officer later joined the crocodiles' handler in assisting with the filming.|$|E

5000|$|The {{group made}} use of {{occasional}} costumes and theatrics customary of the glam rock trends of the time. [...] They played gigs when available in the Detroit metro area, and were even touted by influential writer Lester Bangs in a piece for Creem magazine and in another piece that appeared in Creem in September 1976 Air-Wreck Genheimer said of the grup: [...] "The Punks played in such a gut grabbing manner that your ear bones feel like they're getting socked in the jaw and cunnilinguisized at the same time". [...] According to Richard Blondy, their former manager and booking agent, [...] "Their music was so intense and so strong, and their stage show was so exciting. It’s just like <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>said</b> about (the Naughty Bits) on ‘Vinyl’--they smack {{you in the face}} and they get your attention". [...] In 1974, the group recorded a series of demos in the basement of Alan and Craig Webber's family house in Waterford Township. [...] Several of the tracks they recorded such as [...] "My Time's Comin'", [...] "Q1", and [...] "Drop Dead" [...] display a thrashing intensity indicative of future punk acts.|$|E
5000|$|Nico Fortuna, a {{sociologist}} and Roma activist, explained {{the distinction between}} Jewish collective memory of the Shoah and the Roma experience: There {{is a difference between}} the Jewish and Roma deportees ... The Jews were shocked and can remember the year, date and time it happened. The Roma shrugged it off. They said, [...] "Of course I was deported. I'm Roma; these things happen to a Roma." [...] The Roma mentality is different from the Jewish mentality. For example, a Roma came to me and asked, [...] "Why do you care so much about these deportations? Your family was not deported." [...] I went, [...] "I care as a Roma" [...] and <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>said</b> back, [...] "I do not care because my family were brave, proud Roma that were not deported."For the Jews it was total and everyone knew this—from bankers to pawnbrokers. For the Roma it was selective and not comprehensive. The Roma were only exterminated in a few parts of Europe such as Poland, the Netherlands, Germany and France. In Romania and much of the Balkans, only nomadic Roma and social outcast Roma were deported. This matters and influences the Roma mentality.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{the liner}} notes for the 2006 {{collection}} A Half Century of Hits, Kennedy didn’t dare release an uptempo single because he couldn't risk radio programmers declaring that Lewis {{was returning to}} his rockabilly past, so up-tempo songs like [...] "Workin’ Man Blues" [...] were consigned to LPs. Although Kennedy liked to record in closed sessions, he eventually came to appreciate that Lewis needed an audience: “Bad as I hated it, he did better with a crowd. I can remember 70 or 80 people {{in the control room}} and standing around the studio. One time we almost had a song nailed and there was a thunk right at the end. Some guy had left the studio and slammed the door. The engineer went down and was chewing him out. 'Why’d you do that?' <b>The</b> <b>guy</b> <b>said,</b> 'The ice in Jerry’s drink was melting.'" [...] The ease with which Lewis conveyed these often bitterly sad country songs came as no surprise to him, as he explained in the 1990 documentary The Jerry Lee Lewis Story: [...] "I am a rock and roll artist and I can cover the other country-type territory if I have to sneak in the back door...If you wanna be an ass-dragging hillbilly singer, you can be one if you really want to." ...|$|E
5000|$|Brett Hoffman, {{who writes}} {{articles}} for PBR, said, [...] "One huge factor that impresses me about Chicken on a Chain is he's big and can move. I really admire any larger bull {{who can be}} compared to an offensive lineman in size and a defensive back in speed. That's one reason that I became a huge fan of the late Bodacious in the mid 1990s." [...] "You just don't see bulls that big that can move like that." [...] Robinson said of Chicken on a Chain. [...] "The bad thing about this is you just don't come across bulls like that much anymore. Cody Lambert says all of the time that Chicken on a Chain is a throwback (to earlier eras of bull riding). He's a throwback to the kind of bulls that they used to get on, bulls that were big and stout and mean." [...] Brett Hoffman again, [...] "The good news is that Chicken on a Chain is back and is going strong. He'll always stand out in my mind, and without a doubt, he's a big hit with many fans." [...] "I had a guy come up to me one time and said Chicken on a Chain is my favorite bull," [...] Robinson said.

5000|$|... "Maggie's Farm" [...] is {{well known}} for being {{at the center of the}} fervor that {{surrounded}} Dylan after his electric set at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival; it was that set's performance of [...] "Maggie's Farm," [...] much faster and more aggressive than on the Bringing It All Back Home recording and featuring prominent lead electric guitar by Mike Bloomfield, that caused the most controversy. The festival's production manager Joe Boyd claimed that [...] "that first note of 'Maggie's Farm' was the loudest thing anybody had ever heard." [...] It is still unknown what exactly was the biggest source of the controversy, with accounts of the event differing from individual to individual. Though Dylan's move from acoustic folk to electric rock had been extremely controversial, many accounts suggest the problem was largely due to poor sound. Pete Seeger, who is often cited as one of the main opponents to Dylan at Newport 1965, claimed in 2005: There are reports of me being anti-him going electric at the '65 Newport Folk festival, but that's wrong. I was the MC that night. He was singing 'Maggie's Farm' and you couldn't understand a word because the mic was distorting his voice. I ran to the mixing desk and said, 'Fix the sound, it's terrible!' <b>The</b> <b>guy</b> <b>said</b> 'No, this is what the young people want.' And I did say that if I had an axe I'd cut the cable!

500|$|Producer Tommy Scott was {{conscious}} {{of the importance of}} Dylan's music on the current pop scene and was eager for Morrison to cover [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] during the 1965 sessions for Them's second LP. After a failed, preliminary attempt to record the track with session pianist Phil Coulter at Regent Sound studios in London, Scott reconsidered his approach to the song. Scott recalled in interview that [...] "The number wasn't going down, Van wasn't sure. Then <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>said</b> he didn't fancy it and thought it was cheap because I'd tried to go after the [...] "Here Comes the Night" [...] tempo." [...] The band returned to the song during a later session at Decca's recording studios. Scott decided to rearrange the song's musical backing, incorporating a distinctive recurring blues riff and piano work from Them's keyboard player, Peter Bardens, resulting in a finished recording that the band were satisfied with. The song featured one of Morrison's most expressive vocals and included subtle changes to Dylan's lyrics; instead of singing [...] "Forget the dead you've left" [...] Morrison alters the line to [...] "Forget the debts you've left".|$|R
5000|$|Hollywood was {{converting}} from silent films, but [...] "talkies" [...] presented {{no problems}} for Dressler, whose rumbling voice could handle both sympathetic scenes and snappy comebacks (the wisecracking stage actress in Chasing Rainbows and the dubious matron in Rudy Vallée'sVagabond Lover). Frances Marion persuaded Thalberg to give Dressler {{the role of}} Marthy in the 1930 film Anna Christie. Garbo and the critics were impressed by Dressler's acting ability, and so was MGM, which quickly signed her to a $500-per-week contract. Dressler went on to act in comedic films which were popular with movie-goers and a lucrative investment for MGM. She became Hollywood's number-one box-office attraction, and stayed on top until her death in 1934. She also took on serious roles. For Min and Bill, with Wallace Beery, she won the 1930-31 Academy Award for Best Actress (the eligibility years were staggered at that time). She was nominated again for Best Actress for her 1932 starring role in Emma, but lost to Helen Hayes. Dressler followed these successes with more hits in 1933, including the comedy Dinner at Eight, in which she played an aging but vivacious former stage actress. Dressler had a memorable bit with Jean Harlow in the film:Harlow: I was reading a book the other day.Dressler: Reading a book?Harlow: Yes, it's all about civilization or something. A nutty kind of a book. Do you know that <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>said</b> that machinery {{is going to take}} the place of every profession?Dressler: Oh my dear, that's something you need never worry about.|$|E
5000|$|The society's members {{perpetuate}} the joke in the media. Tom Waits described it to Rolling Stone in 1986 as [...] "somewhere between the Elks Club and the Academy Awards", and {{claimed to have}} met Jarmusch at an {{annual meeting of the}} New York chapter. When asked about the society by friend and collaborator Luc Sante in a 1989 interview, Jarmusch commented [...] "I'm not at liberty to divulge information about the organization, other than to tell you that it does exist. I can identify three other members of the organization: Tom Waits, John Lurie, and Richard Boes ... You have to have a facial structure such that you could be related to, or be a son of, Lee Marvin. There are no women, obviously, in the organization. We have communiques and secret meetings. Other than that, I can't talk about it." [...] Jarmusch revealed in a 1992 interview that the real son of Lee Marvin, Christopher, had objected to the existence of the organization in an encounter with Waits at a bar: Six months ago Tom Waits was in a bar in somewhere like Sonoma County in Northern California, and the bartender said, ”You’re Tom Waits, right? A guy over there wants to talk to you.”Tom went over to this dark corner booth and the guy sitting there said, ”Sit down, I want to talk to you.”So Tom started getting a little aggressive: ”What the fuck {{do you want to talk}} to me about? I don’t know you.”And <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>said,</b> ”What is this bullshit about the Sons of Lee Marvin?”Tom said, ”Well, it’s a secret organization and I’m not supposed to talk about it.”The guy said, ”I don’t like it.”Tom said, ”What’s it to you?”The guy said, ”I’m Lee Marvin’s son”—and he really was. He thought it was insulting, but it’s not, it’s completely out of respect for Lee Marvin. Jim Jarmusch, in interview with Film Comment, June 1992 ...|$|E
5000|$|Released in November 1981, Adventures in Modern Recording {{involved}} Horn {{experimenting with}} numerous production techniques, {{especially with the}} heavy use of sampling with the Fairlight CMI, with instruments from the computer such as the drums on [...] "Inner City" [...] and the big band jazz sounds on [...] "Vermillion Sands". These same sampling techniques would later be used in records he produced such as Slave To The Rhythm by Grace Jones, Yes's 90125, Art of Noise's The Seduction of Claude Debussy and Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Welcome to the Pleasuredome. While the album garnered little attention in the United Kingdom, Horn recalled in 2010 that the album was a commercial success in France, and in the United States the album peaked at number 161 on the American Billboard 200. By {{the time of the}} album's release, when Horn was also producing ABC's album The Lexicon of Love, he decided to take Sinclair's advice that he always {{was meant to be a}} producer rather than a performer or songwriter, thus the performance of [...] "Lenny" [...] on a TV show in the Netherlands, with ABC as the backing band, marked the end of the Buggles. As Horn recalled when he was interviewed after the show: “I’ll never forget it because <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>said</b> to me, ‘well, things are not looking so good for you’, and I said ‘how do you mean?’ And he said ‘well, you know, your first record was a big hit now this record is number eleven, so your career is going downhill’. And I said ‘well you know what? You see these guys, this is a band called ABC and I’m a producer now I don’t really care about this stuff, I’m just doing it to promote the record.
