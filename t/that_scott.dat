5|$|Inconsistencies in the {{official}} accounts of Scott's death have been cited in conspiracy theories, which suggest <b>that</b> <b>Scott</b> died of a heroin overdose, or was killed by exhaust fumes redirected into the car, or that Kinnear did not exist.

500|$|Zelda {{read the}} {{unfinished}} manuscript {{of the novel}} Scott was writing upon his death, The Last Tycoon. She wrote to literary critic Edmund Wilson, who had agreed to edit the book, musing on his legacy. Zelda believed, her biographer Milford said, <b>that</b> <b>Scott's</b> work contained [...] "an American temperament grounded in belief in oneself and 'will-to-survive' <b>that</b> <b>Scott's</b> contemporaries had relinquished. Scott, she insisted, had not. His work possessed a vitality and stamina because of his indefatigable faith in himself." ...|$|R

5|$|Scott {{is presumed}} to have died on 29 March 1912, or {{possibly}} one day later. The positions of the bodies in the tent when it was discovered eight months later suggested <b>that</b> <b>Scott</b> {{was the last of}} the three to die.|$|E
5|$|Scott sat out the 2006 {{season as}} a redshirt. After summer {{training}} camp, the coaching staff moved Scott to wide receiver, a position that lacked depth, but head coach Ralph Friedgen said <b>that</b> <b>Scott</b> had some difficulty making the adjustment. He was, however, named the offensive scout team {{player of the week}} for his performance in the practices before the Florida State game.|$|E
5|$|The first {{expedition}} {{to reach the}} geographic South Pole was led by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. He and four others arrived at the pole on 14December 1911, five weeks ahead of a British party led by Robert Falcon Scott {{as part of the}} Terra Nova Expedition.

5|$|Though it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>Scott</b> would retire to manage his business in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the Chicago White Sox signed Scott in February 1926. The Cincinnati Reds purchased Scott from the White Sox in July 1926. He played in four games for the Reds.|$|E
5|$|During the {{southern}} party's absence the relief ship Morning arrived, bringing fresh supplies. The expedition's organisers {{had assumed that}} the Discovery would be free from the ice in early 1903, enabling Scott to carry out further seaborne exploration and survey work before winter set in. It was intended that Discovery would return to New Zealand in March or April, then home to England via the Pacific, continuing its magnetic survey en route. Morning would provide any assistance <b>that</b> <b>Scott</b> might require during this period.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} Mount Tabor High School for 9th and 10th {{grade and}} then completed {{his last two}} years at Richard J. Reynolds High School in Winston-Salem, graduating in 1983.

Scott {{was inducted into the}} Richard J. Reynolds High School Hall of Fame during a ceremony on February 6, 2015, which took place during the Reynolds/Mt. Tabor (the two high schools <b>that</b> <b>Scott</b> attended) basketball game.|$|E

5|$|However, Markham {{had second}} thoughts, {{and was soon}} writing to the current RGS president, Leonard Darwin, to express disbelief about Shackleton's claimed latitudes, repeating these doubts to Scott. Historians have surmised <b>that</b> <b>Scott</b> was Markham's protégé, and {{that the old man}} resented polar glory going to someone else. Whatever his reason, Markham adopted a {{bitterness}} towards Shackleton which he retained {{for the rest of his}} life. He is said to have crossed out all favourable references to Shackleton in his own notes on the Discovery expedition, and to have virtually ignored Shackleton's achievements in a 1912 address to the British Association. He was equally dismissive in his history of Antarctic exploration, The Lands of Silence (published posthumously in 1921).|$|E
5|$|General Atkinson, {{who learned}} in early July <b>that</b> <b>Scott</b> {{would be taking}} command, hoped to bring the war to a {{successful}} conclusion before Scott's arrival. The Americans had difficulty locating the British Band, however, {{thanks in part to}} false intelligence given to them by area Native Americans. Potawatomis and Ho-Chunks in Illinois, many of whom had sought to remain neutral in the war, decided to cooperate with the Americans. Tribal leaders knew that some of their warriors had aided the British Band, and so they hoped that a highly visible show of support for the Americans would dissuade U.S. officials from punishing the tribes after the conflict was over. Wearing white headbands to distinguish themselves from hostile Natives, Ho-Chunks and Potawatomis served as guides for Atkinson's army. Ho-Chunks sympathetic to the plight of Black Hawk's people misled Atkinson into thinking that the British Band was still at Lake Koshkonong. While Atkinson's men were trudging through the swamps and running low on provisions, the British Band had in fact relocated miles to the north. Potawatomis under Billy Caldwell also managed to demonstrate support for the Americans while avoiding battle.|$|E
5|$|In June 1790, Harmar and Arthur St. Clair {{were ordered}} to lead another {{expedition}} against the Indians. Harmar had hoped <b>that</b> <b>Scott,</b> Isaac Shelby, or Benjamin Logan would join the campaign and lead the Kentucky militia, but all three declined. Scott had been elected to represent Woodford County in the Virginia General Assembly, and his legislative duty prevented his service. He believed that the Kentucky militiamen would only serve under Colonel Robert Trotter, a veteran of Logan's earlier Indian fighting campaigns. Ultimately, command of the Kentucky militiamen was given to Major John Hardin, and many militiamen refused to join the campaign, just as Scott had predicted. During the expedition, Scott's son, Merritt, who was serving as a captain in the Woodford County militia, was killed and scalped. The entire expedition was a failure, and it solidified the Kentucky militiamen's strong distrust of Harmar; most vowed never to fight alongside him again.|$|E

5|$|Soon after Washington's {{orders were}} delivered, a British raiding party under George Collier and Edward Mathew arrived in Virginia to capture or destroy {{supplies}} {{that might otherwise}} be sent southward to aid the reinforcements going to South Carolina. Scott's orders changed again; the Virginia House of Delegates ordered him to immediately prepare defenses against Collier and Mathew's raids. When it became clear to both the legislature and Washington that Collier and Mathew intended only to raid supplies, not to invade, they concluded that the local militia would be able to sufficiently protect Virginia's interests and <b>that</b> <b>Scott</b> should continue to recruit men to reinforce the south. The legislators presented him with a horse, a firearm, and 500 pounds sterling for his quick response to the threat.|$|E
5|$|The Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB) later {{released}} consolidated information {{stating that}} the first episode had received 8.31 million viewers on ITV, with a further 801,000 tuning in on ITV HD, and 310,000 on ITV1+1, totalling the viewing figures to 9.42 for the first episode. The episode was 2011's fourth highest-rating drama broadcast, {{as well as the}} highest-rating broadcast for a new drama. By episode two it was reported <b>that</b> <b>Scott</b> & Bailey has dropped nearly 1.8 million viewers from episode one, with overnight figures suggesting 6.14 million (23.6%) tuned in, though it was still the number one rated programme in its timeslot. The programme continued to outperform its competitors in its timeslot until its end, beating competition including BBC One dramas Case Histories and Stolen.|$|E
5|$|When Washington {{and his men}} {{abandoned}} Valley Forge in mid-June 1778, Scott {{was ordered}} to take 1,500 light infantrymen and harass the British forces as they marched across New Jersey. On June 26, the Marquis de Lafayette joined Scott with an additional 1,000 men, {{in anticipation of a}} major offensive the next day. General Charles Lee was chosen to command the operation, which was delayed by one day due to inadequate communications and delays in forwarding provisions. Lee shared no battle plan with his generals, later claiming he had insufficient intelligence to form one. On the morning of June 28, Lee launched the attack, beginning the Battle of Monmouth. During the battle, Scott observed American artillerymen retreating. Not realizing that the men had only run out of ammunition, Scott believed the retreat was a sign of the collapse of the American offensive and ordered his men to retreat as well. Lacking a battle plan for guidance, William Maxwell and Anthony Wayne, whose units were fighting adjacent to Scott's men, also ordered a retreat. With such a great number of his men retreating, Lee fell back and eventually aborted the offensive. Although Washington's main force arrived and stopped the British advance, Scott's retreat was partially blamed for giving them control of the battle. Tradition holds that, {{in the aftermath of the}} battle, Scott witnessed Washington excoriating Lee in a profanity-laden tirade, but biographer Harry M. Ward considered it unlikely <b>that</b> <b>Scott</b> was present at the meeting. Lee was later court-martialed for the retreat and suspended from command.|$|E
50|$|Two days later, Cherry-Garrard fainted {{and became}} an invalid for the {{following}} days. Atkinson set forth to fetch Scott, but on 30 March was forced to turn back {{in the face of}} low temperatures, and concluded <b>that</b> <b>Scott's</b> party had perished.|$|R
