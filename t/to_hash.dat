5|$|Another {{method of}} {{constructing}} hash functions with both high quality and practical speed is tabulation hashing. In this method, the hash value for a key {{is computed by}} using each byte of the key as an index into a table of random numbers (with a different table for each byte position). The numbers from those table cells are then combined by a bitwise exclusive or operation. Hash functions constructed this way are only 3-independent. Nevertheless, linear probing using these hash functions takes constant expected time per operation. Both tabulation hashing and standard methods for generating 5-independent hash functions are limited to keys that have a fixed number of bits. To handle strings or other types of variable-length keys, {{it is possible to}} compose a simpler universal hashing technique that maps the keys to intermediate values and a higher quality (5-independent or tabulation) hash function that maps the intermediate values <b>to</b> <b>hash</b> table indices.|$|E

25|$|The first {{instance}} of tabulation hashing is Zobrist hashing, {{a method for}} hashing positions in abstract board games such as chess named after Albert Lindsey Zobrist, who published it in 1970. In this method, a random bitstring is generated for each game feature such as {{a combination of a}} chess piece and a square of the chessboard. Then, <b>to</b> <b>hash</b> any game position, the bitstrings for the features of that position are combined by a bitwise exclusive or. The resulting hash value can then be used as an index into a transposition table. Because each move typically changes {{only a small number of}} game features, the Zobrist value of the position after a move can be updated quickly from the value of the position before the move, without needing to loop over all of the features of the position.|$|E
500|$|A random {{bipartite graph}} with n {{vertices}} {{on each side}} of its bipartition, and with cn edges chosen independently at random from each of the n2 possible pairs of vertices, is a pseudoforest with high probability whenever c is a constant strictly less than one.

500|$|According to the Hindustan Times, Kaminey [...] "is {{the first}} attempt to deal with reality in a mature, matter of fact manner." [...] Unlike other Hindi films, in which the female lead is Sita, the protagonist is Rama and the {{antagonist}} is Ravana, the characters in Kaminey are nuanced humans in [...] "layered and complex" [...] situations. Namrata Joshi from Outlook wrote that Kaminey reflects Bhardwaj's [...] "enduring fascination for underdogs, characters {{on the margins of}} society and the morally compromised". Bhardwaj told Rediff.com that the film deals with [...] "themes that affect our lives directly", and [...] "is a reminder that we all have a dark side, and often we are not fully aware of that side". Rakesh Bedi from The Economic Times wrote, [...] "Bhardwaj presents the two warring brothers with speech defects. In today's world of logorrhea, communication is fraught with many dangers: misunderstandings, paranoias, recriminations, conflicts. Everyone speaks but no one understands. Bhardwaj gave the twins verbal impediments to show that the world has now been so hardwired to convoluted and calamitous communication that it needs silence or a speech defect <b>to</b> <b>hash</b> things out." [...] He continued, [...] "ith some glitches, Bhardwaj has almost re-birthed the Hindi film". The film also explores sex and sexuality, which according to Bedi were explored in a [...] "radically different and refreshing" [...] way, and the director [...] "daringly takes it a step further". When Sweety becomes pregnant, the couple [...] "decide to carry the pregnancy to term after a bit of hesitation. So she literally pushes her man into marriage. (Had Bhardwaj abjured marriage, {{it would have been a}} complete break but the nuptials were essential to the drama of the film.)" [...] The Daily Beast said that [...] "for aficionados of the Hindi-language genre, Kaminey is a revolutionary manifesto. It takes classic Bollywood tropes—estranged brothers, a case of mistaken identity, high drama approaching slapstick comedy—and presents them with Hollywood-style realism instead of Bollywood's wink-nudge mix of melodrama and posturing.|$|E
