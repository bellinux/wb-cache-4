30|$|During a hard link {{switching}} procedure, {{user devices}} cannot receive the {{signal from the}} serving transmitter, {{which leads to a}} data interruption problem and then QoS degradation. Thus, the process duration of a hard link switching scheme (i.e., link switching delay), which mainly originates from the scanning period, is an important problem in terms of guaranteeing a seamless data transmission. This problem can be solved effectively in soft link switching. In soft link switching, a user device can simultaneously communicate with two or more transmitters, including its current serving transmitter. The link between the user device and its current serving transmitter is disconnected only after it has successfully connected to the <b>target</b> <b>transmitter.</b>|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} {{recently}} reported {{a lot of}} electromagnetic phenomena associated with earthquakes (EQs). Among these, the ground-based reception of subionospheric waves from VLF/LF transmitters, is recognized as a promising tool to investigate the ionospheric perturbations associated with EQs. This paper deals with the corresponding whistler-mode signals in the upper ionosphere from those VLF/LF transmitters, which is the counterpart of subionospheric signals. The whistler-mode VLF/LF transmitter signals are detected on board the French satellite, DEMETER launched on 29 June 2004. We have chosen several large Japanese EQs including the Miyagi-oki EQ (16 August 2005; M= 7. 2, depth= 36 km), and the <b>target</b> <b>transmitter</b> is a Japanese LF transmitter (JJY) whose transmitter frequency is 40 kHz. Due to large longitudinal separation of each satellite orbit (2500 km), we have to adopt a statistical analysis over a rather long period (such as 3 weeks or one month) to have reliable data set. By analyzing the spatial distribution of JJY signal intensity (in the form of {{signal to noise ratio}} SNR) during a period of 4 months including the Miyagi-oki EQ, we have found significant changes in the intensity; generally the SNR is significantly depleted before the EQ, which {{is considered to be a}} precursory ionospheric signature of the EQ. This abnormal effect is reasonably explained in terms of either (1) enhanced absorption of whistler-mode LF signals in the lower ionosphere due to the lowering of the lower ionosphere, or (2) nonlinear wave-wave scattering. Finally, this analysis suggests an important role of satellite observation in the study of lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of {{the effect that the}} <b>target</b> <b>transmitter</b> apertures and receiver apertures have on the performance of a laser doppler radar is presented in this thesis. Empirical design equations are presented and methods of using these equations to predict system performance for a particular target material are described. Two important parameters are defined and have been measured together with their statistical properties, They are: beta, the 'scattering loss factor' which accounts for the power lost due to scatter at the radar target, and gamma, the 'detector loss factor' which accounts for signal loss at the detector due to inefficient mixing of the scattered light. Knowledge of these two parameters for a given target enables one to determine the signal level at the output of the detector. beta is shown to be a function of the surface material and a method of obtaining its value is described. The statistics of gamma are shown to be a function of the speckle diameter/receiver diameter ratio, but appears to contradict theoretical predictions. It is found that gamma {{is a function of the}} ratio of the speckle size to the receiver size and has been determined for ratios from 01 to 12. The statistics of gamma are presented and agree with the theoretical description. Doppler broadening, which limits the sensitivity of a Doppler system, has been measured for rotational and translational velocities. From these results the optimum optical configuration can be predicted. A general design problem is discussed to show how the parameters described can be used to predict the system performance and to determine the operational parameters...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for wireless communication services {{has resulted in}} crowding of the electromagnetic spectrum. The "spectral-commons" model, where {{a portion of the}} electromagnetic spectrum is public and used on an ad-hoc basis, has been proposed to free up spectrum that has been allocated but underutilized. Ad-hoc wireless networks (networks with no central control) are also interesting in their own right as they do not require costly infrastructure, are robust to single-node failures, and can be deployed in environments where it is difficult to deploy infrastructure. The main contributions of this thesis are expressions for the mean and in some cases the variance of the spectral efficiency (bits/second/Hz) of single-hop links in random wireless networks {{as a function of the}} number of antennas per node, link-length, interferer density, and path-loss-exponent (an environmental parameter that determines signal decay with distance), under assumptions chosen for realistic implementability in the near future. These results improve our understanding of such systems as they indicate the data rates achievable as a function of tangible parameters like user density and environmental characteristics, and are useful for designers of wireless networks to trade-off hardware costs, data-rates, and user densities. We found that constant mean spectral efficiencies can be maintained in wireless networks with increasing user density by linearly increasing the number of antenna elements per user, or by maintaining a constant fraction of nodes connected to high capacity infrastructure like optical fiber, equipped with antenna arrays. These are promising ways to serve an increasing density of users without increasing bandwidth. Additionally, several interesting features of such networks have been highlighted. (cont.) For instance we found that the mean and variance of spectral efficiencies can be characterized in terms of a parameter called the link rank, which on average equals the number of interferers whose signal power is stronger at a representative receiver than its <b>target</b> <b>transmitter.</b> Rank thus combines the effects of node density and link lengths. Another interesting finding is that mean spectral efficiency in networks with rank- 1 links, and equal numbers of antennas at transmit and receive sides can be improved if nodes turn off two thirds of their transmit antennas. These results were derived using infinite random matrix theory and validated using Monte Carlo simulations which were also used to characterize the distribution of spectral efficiencies in such networks. by Siddhartan Govindasamy.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{question for the}} design of future wireless networks concerns the nature of spectrum management and the protocols that govern use of the spectrum. In the oligopoly model, spectrum is owned and centrally managed, and the protocols tend to reflect this centralized nature. In the common's model, spectrum is a public good, and protocols must support ad hoc communication. This work presents the design, tradeoffs and parameter optimization for a new protocol (Simultaneous Transmissions in Interference (STI-MAC)) for ad hoc wireless networks. The key idea behind the STI-MAC protocol is 'channel stuffing,' that is, allowing network nodes to more efficiently use spatial, time and frequency degrees of freedom. This is achieved in three key ways. First, 'channel stuffing' is achieved through multiple antennas that are used at the receiver to mitigate interference using Minimum-Mean-Squared-Error (MMSE) receivers, allowing network nodes to transmit simultaneously in interference limited environments. The protocol also supports the use of multiple transmit antennas to beamform to the target receiver. Secondly, 'channel stuffing' is achieved {{through the use of a}} control channel that is orthogonal in time to the data channel, where nodes contend in order to participate on the data channel. And thirdly, 'channel stuffing' is achieved through a protest scheme that prevents data channel overloading. The STI-MAC protocol is analyzed via Monte-Carlo simulations in which transmitter nodes are uniformly distributed in a plane, each at a fixed distance from their target receiver; and as a function of network parameters including the number of transmit and receive antennas, the distance between a transmitter-receiver pair (link-length), the average number of transmitters whose received signal is stronger at a given receiver than its <b>target</b> <b>transmitter</b> (link-rank), number of transmitter-receiver pairs, the distribution on the requested rate, the offered load, and the transmit scheme. The STI-MAC protocol is benchmarked relative to simulations of the 802. 11 (n) (Wi-Fi) protocol. The key results of this work show a 3 X gain in throughput relative to 802. 11 (n) in typical multi-antenna wireless networks that have 20 transmitter-receiver pairs, a link-length of 10 meters, four receive antennas and a single transmit antenna. We also show a reduction in delay by a factor of two when the networks are heavily loaded. We find that the link-rank is a key parameter affecting STIMAC gains over Wi-Fi. In simulations of networks with 40 transmit-receiver pairs, link-rank of three, a link-length of 10 meters, and eight transmit and receive antennas in which the transmitter beamforms to its target receiver in its strongest target channel mode, we find gains in throughput of at least 5 X over the 802. 11 (n) protocol. by Danielle A.

40|$|Abstract. In many {{applications}} such as wireless crime scene investiga-tion, we {{want to use a}} single device moving along a route for accurate and efficient localization without the help of any positioning infrastructure or trained signal strength map. Our experiments show that in a complicated environment, such as building corridors and downtown areas, triangula-tion or trilateration cannot be used for accurate localization via single device. A simple approach, which is better and robust, is to use where the maximum RSS (received signal strength) is sensed as the targetâs lo-cation. The question is how to make sure the maximum RSS is received while moving. Our novel RSS sampling theory presented in this paper an-swers this question: if RSS samples can reconstruct a <b>target</b> <b>transmitterâs</b> power distribution over space, the location corresponding to the peak of such power distribution is the targetâs location. We apply the Nyquist sampling theory to the RSS sampling process, and derive a mathematical model to determine the RSS sampling rate given the targetâs distance and its packet transmission rate. To validate our RSS sampling theory, we developed BotLoc, which is a programmable and self-coordinated robot armed with a wireless sniffer.

However, the chronic use is associated with the emergence of motor fluctuations, which {{has been one of the}} most troublesome dilemmas in PD's treatment. A plenty of clinical studies evidenced some risk factors would contribute to the emergence of the motor complications. Therefore, a better understanding of these risk factors may help to draw up the preventive strategies to target "at risk" populations before the onset of motor complications. Therapeutic strategies using different types and timing of dopaminergic therapy may influence the emergence of motor complications. Unfortunately, the traditional oral treatments for motor complications are only partially effective, rarely abolishing motor complications. The clinical improvement might be achieved with invasive strategies via subcutaneous or intraduodenal delivery of apomorphine or levodopa, or deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus, especially at late stage of PD. Besides, <b>targeting</b> <b>transmitter</b> systems beyond the dopamine system is another interesting approach for the motor complications of PD.

Assuming that the targets are sparsely located in the angle- Doppler space, based on the samples forwarded by the receive nodes the fusion center formulates an l 1 -optimization problem, the solution of which yields target angle and Doppler information. The proposed approach achieves the superior resolution of MIMO radar with far fewer samples than required by other approaches. This implies power savings during the communication phase between the receive nodes and the fusion center. Performance {{in the presence of a}} jammer is analyzed for the case of slowly moving targets.

40|$|The envisioned dense nano-network {{inside the}} human body at {{terahertz}} (THz) frequency suffers a communication performance degradation among nano-devices. The reason for this performance limitation {{is not only the}} path loss and molecular absorption noise, but also the presence of multi-user interference and the interference caused by utilising any communication scheme, such as time spread ONâOFF keying (TS-OOK). In this paper, an interference model utilising TS-OOK as a communication scheme of the THz communication channel inside {{the human body}} has been developed and the probability distribution of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for THz communication within different human tissues, such as blood, skin, and fat, has been analyzed and presented. In addition, this paper evaluates the performance degradation by investigating the mean values of SINR under different node densities in the area and the probabilities of transmitting pulses. It results in the conclusion that the interference restrains the achievable communication distance to approximate 1 mm, and more specific range depends on the particular transmission circumstance. Results presented in this paper also show that by controlling the pulse transmission probability and node density, the system performance can be ameliorated. In particular, SINR of in vivo THz communication between the deterministic <b>targeted</b> <b>transmitter</b> and the receiver with random interfering nodes in the medium improves about 10 dB, when the node density decreases one order.

Time reversal methods for locating the target have been used to find the approximate location of the target. Manual distance calculations from <b>target</b> to the <b>transmitter</b> and receiver have been done. Comparison of actual distance from <b>target</b> to the <b>transmitter</b> is compared with simulation results. Different model simulation setups and their results have proved that using UWB Time reversed signals; a still or moving target can be detected with centimeter window precision...|$|R
