40|$|Transparent {{building}} {{appeals to}} imagination. The availability of glass {{in all shapes}} and sizes is continuously increasing; architects and engineers thankfully make use of the given opportunities. But glass has also some specific disadvantages, as it’s extreme brittleness. Luckily more materials are available that offer the desired transparency; <b>transparent</b> <b>plastics</b> might be a promising addition to the world of transparent building. The <b>transparent</b> <b>plastics</b> that are considered most suitable for building applications are Acrylic (PMMA) and polycarbonate (PC). In this research the behaviour of these <b>transparent</b> <b>plastics</b> is analysed and it is investigated whether and how the materials can be used in building structures, to further explore the dream of completely <b>transparent</b> buildings. <b>Transparent</b> <b>plastics</b> show some, for building materials, unusual characteristics, as thermoplastic and visco-elastic behaviour, special production techniques and a very low ratio between Young’s modulus and strength. This requires a different design approach. A case study is performed to get more feeling for the design with thermoplastics. To be able to use the freedom of shape and to explore the limits of the materials an observation tower is designed. An entirely transparent tower, made completely from <b>transparent</b> <b>plastics.</b> The design demonstrates that it is technically possible to design building structures in acrylic and polycarbonate. <b>Transparent</b> <b>plastics</b> offer promising possibilities for building design but still a lot will have to be investigated further before they can really be used for load bearing structures. For instance the development of standard details, the investigation of fire safety, the buckling behaviour of plastics and the long-term behaviour for a design life over 20 years, which is now the limit by a lack of data,. This will be a trajectory of years but other materials have come that long road before. Once the plastics industry recognises the opportunities of investing in this new product market the development of suitable building products, details and optimal material compositions will certainly progress faster. <b>Transparent</b> <b>plastics</b> will probably never become a threatening substitute for standard glazing applications, but they have the ability to become a worthy colleague to glass in the future and an interesting addition to the world of transparent building.

Then the military quarters on the battlements were removed and the inner cloister was built. The architectural landscape designer António Viana Barreto began a three-year project in 1953 to integrate the tower with the local shoreline. In 1983 the site hosted the 17th European Exhibition on Art, Science and Culture, and various projects involving the building were undertaken, among them covering the cloister with a <b>transparent</b> <b>plastic</b> cupola.

25|$|Fly tying {{material}} {{can be anything}} used to construct a fly on a hook. Traditional materials were threads, yarns, furs, feathers, hair, tinsels, cork, balsa and wire. Today's materials include not only all sorts of natural and dyed furs, hair and feathers, but also {{a wide array of}} synthetic materials. Rabbit, mink, muskrat, fox, bear, squirrel and other furs, deer, elk, moose hair and chicken, pheasant, turkey, duck, goose and partridge feathers are commonly incorporated into artificial flies. Chicken neck and saddle hackle, so essential for many artificial fly patterns, are from animals especially bred to produce hackles of superior performance and color. Synthetics have allowed fly tyers to replicate rare and sometimes endangered furs and feathers as well as create completely new types of flies. Synthetics such as rubber legs, plastic wings and <b>transparent</b> <b>plastic</b> cords, chenilles, and all sorts and colors of flashy materials that can be incorporated into the wings and bodies of today's artificial fly are available to the 21st-century fly tyer.

25|$|Platinum coins are {{a popular}} investment, {{and each year}} {{the number of such}} coins sold by Sberbank of Russia {{increases}} by 30–50%. Most experts agree that such investments should have a long-term character, as the rise of the platinum price is relatively slow– about 80% over the last 5 years, except for a rapid rise followed by decline in 2008. Also, whereas most banks can sell platinum coins, only a few buy them, as this requires evaluation by an experienced professional. For example, only 5% of offices of Sberbank (the major bank of Russia) in the capital city of Moscow redeem precious metal coins. The selling price is also much affected by visible scratches, spots, patina, and other defects introduced by bad handling. For this reason, most bullion coins are sealed in <b>transparent</b> <b>plastic</b> right after removal from the press. They are then stored in a dry room with relative humidity below 80% and at temperatures between 15 and 40°C. If a coin is removed from its plastic seal, it is recommended not to store it in PVC albums, as PVC molecules gradually break down, releasing organochlorine compounds which produce patina on the coins. These compounds may also form acids by reacting with moisture. Unlike silver, platinum does not corrode. However, as is true for all unprotected coins, platinum coins are prone to contamination which can be caused even by washing with (chlorine-containing) tap water.|$|E

500|$|The {{cathode-ray}} tube {{amusement device}} {{consists of a}} cathode ray tube connected to an oscilloscope {{with a set of}} knobs and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program. The CRT projects a spot on the oscilloscope display screen, which traces a parabolic arc across the screen when a switch is activated by the player. This beam spot represents the trajectory of an artillery shell. Overlaid on the screen are <b>transparent</b> <b>plastic</b> targets representing objects such as airplanes. At the end of the spot's trajectory, the beam defocuses, resulting in the spot expanding and blurring. This represents the shell exploding as if detonated by a time fuze. The goal of the game is to have the beam defocus when it is within the bounds of a target. Prior to the beam spot beginning its arc, the player can turn the control knobs to direct the beam spot's trajectory and adjust the delay of the shell burst. The machine can be set to fire a [...] "shell" [...] either once or at a regular interval, which is adjustable by the player. This gives the player the goal of hitting one of the overlay targets with the shell burst within a time limit. The player was recommended to make the trajectory far removed from a straight line [...] "so as to require an increased amount of skill and care".|$|E
