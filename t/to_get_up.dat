5|$|Before all the {{steerage}} passengers {{had even}} {{a chance of}} their lives, the Titanics sailors fastened the doors and companionways leading up from the third-class section... A crowd of men was trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They {{said they wanted to}} keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still down there.|$|E
5|$|Despite being bred for racing, Whippets can be couch potatoes. When {{not running}} around, {{they are usually}} asleep or cuddled in their owner's lap. They are not prone to {{fighting}} but {{have been known to}} chase small pets, due to their sighthound nature. They also have a tendency <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> on furniture. Whippets are touch sensitive, meaning that they tend to jump or overreact when touched unexpectedly.|$|E

The first the recipients would know of the attack was bullets coming up through {{the bottom of the}} fuselage of the aircraft, often causing death or injury, holing petrol tanks and crippling engines. The gun, being fed by a drum of ammunition, could also be reloaded in its pulled-down position, the pilot having two or more spare drums located in his cockpit.|$|E

5|$|Common {{agreement}} about the day's layout or schedule confers so many advantages that a standard DST schedule {{has generally been}} chosen over ad hoc efforts <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> earlier. The advantages of coordination are so great that many people ignore whether DST is in effect by altering their nominal work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight. DST is commonly not observed during most of winter, because its mornings are darker; workers may have no sunlit leisure time, and children may need to leave for school in the dark. Since DST is applied to many varying communities, its effects may be very different depending on their culture, light levels, geography, and climate; {{that is why it}} is hard to make generalized conclusions about the absolute effects of the practice. Some areas may adopt DST simply as a matter of coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits.|$|E
5|$|Humber was {{assigned}} to start the year with the Omaha Royals of the PCL. On June 10, 2010, while pitching in a game for Omaha, Humber {{was hit in the}} face on a line drive by Luis Cruz. After lying on the mound for a few minutes, he was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and walk on his own to the dugout. He was then transported to a local hospital, where he received eighteen stitches. He earned the second PCL Pitcher of the Week Award of his career for play during the week ending August 1. He won the award based on having posted a complete game 4-hit 7-strikeout shutout against the Nashville Sounds on July 30.|$|E
5|$|Sahil and Jai {{drive to}} Mahabaleshwar overnight, and upon arrival decide {{to visit the}} local market. Jai is amazed by Sahil's skill as a guitarist and {{suggests}} that he pursue {{a career as a}} fulltime musician. Later, he gifts him a guitar during lunch. The two engage in several arguments and bicker about their plans throughout the trip, while enjoying each other's company nonetheless. Sahil is irked by Jai's indifferent behaviour and finds it annoying that he works even during the trip. Jai too is not pleased with Sahil's continuous badgering. One night, the two get into a heated argument over their differences. Later, Jai embraces Sahil in his bed and tries to kiss him. The latter resists, and asks Jai to go to sleep as they have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> early the next morning.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{budget was}} so small that during the 32 days of {{shooting}} in Eugene, mostly in November, Landis had no trailer or office and could not watch dailies for three weeks. His wife Deborah Nadoolman purchased most of the costumes at local thrift stores, and she and Judy Belushi made the party togas. Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene for reporters visiting the set where the director pretended to be angry at the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis grabbed a breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill's head. He {{fell to the ground}} and pretended to be unconscious. The reporters were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up,</b> he refused to move.|$|E
5|$|The {{walk back}} to Bear Valley was very slow; at one point, Reed sent ahead {{two of the men}} to {{retrieve}} the first cache of food, expecting the third relief to come at any moment, a small party led by Selim E. Woodworth. A violent blizzard arose after they scaled the pass. Five-year-old Isaac Donner froze to death, and Reed nearly died. Mary Donner's feet were badly burned because they were so frostbitten that she did not realize she was sleeping with them in the fire. When the storm passed, the Breen and Graves families were too apathetic and exhausted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and move, not having eaten for days. The relief party {{had no choice but to}} leave without them.|$|E
5|$|For {{those who}} were not injured or killed {{outright}} by moving objects, there was little time to reach safety, especially for the men who were manning the guns on the main deck or fetching ammunition and supplies in the hold. The companionways that connected the decks with one another would have become bottlenecks for fleeing men, something indicated by the positioning of many of the skeletons recovered from the wreck. What turned the sinking into a major tragedy in terms of lives lost was the anti-boarding netting that covered the upper decks in the waist (the midsection of the ship) and the sterncastle. With the exception of the men who were stationed in the tops in the masts, most of those who managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> from below deck were trapped under the netting; they would have been in view of the surface, and their colleagues above, but with little or no chance to break through, and were dragged down with the ship. Out of a crew of at least 400, fewer than 35 escaped, a catastrophic casualty rate of over 90%.|$|E

5|$|However, {{once on the}} bus, Lisa {{realizes she}} is on the wrong bus and is dropped off in the middle of nowhere. During his lunch break at work, Homer has a {{conversation}} with Lenny and Carl. He tells them that he let Lisa ride the bus alone. Lenny and Carl point out the error of his judgment, and Homer leaves work to go look for her. He heads to the museum and ends up in downtown Springfield. He uses a cherrypicker <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> higher. Homer and Lisa spot each other, but the vehicle's wheels creak backwards and it rolls down a hill. It slides off the edge of a pier at the harbor into a river. Lisa tells the drawbridge operator to close the bridge so Homer can grab on. His head is caught between the two closing halves and he survives with nothing more than a few tire marks across his forehead.|$|E
5|$|While Margarito did not land {{a lot of}} punches, he {{remained}} the more engaged fighter in the sixth round. A left hook to the body had Cotto on the defensive early in the seventh round, but {{he was able to}} fend off additional difficulty. A right hand from Cotto slowed Margarito, but he returned with punches that forced Cotto to clinch. Margarito commanded the bulk of the round, throwing 130punches in the round according to Compubox. Cotto was advocated by his corner in between rounds to stay off the ropes. He obliged, providing lateral movement throughout the round but with approximately 30seconds left, Margarito was able to trap Cotto in a corner, but Cotto managed to escape. It was more of the same in the ninth round, with Cotto going back and forth between southpaw and conventional stance. Margarito continued charging ahead, although Cotto would counterpunch sufficiency to avoid Margarito. The same pattern applied as in the previous two rounds, with Margarito charging forward and Cotto using movement while anticipating chances to counterpunch. Margarito immediately concluded the gap in the final 15seconds, landing a left hook, left uppercut and right hand that had Cotto against the ropes. Halfway through the eleventh round, a left uppercut by Margarito left Cotto vulnerable as he took a knee after Margarito landed a right uppercut and two right hands. Cotto managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up,</b> but he went down again, despite Margarito not landing another punch. The referee moved in to count, but Evangelista Cotto, Cotto's trainer and uncle, climbed onto the ring apron and threw in the towel. The official time of the stoppage was 2:05of round eleven.|$|E
