5|$|Ferris offers {{himself in}} {{exchange}} to Aisha's kidnappers, and {{is brought to}} the middle of the desert, with Hoffman watching everything via a surveillance drone.

When Ferris asks Al-Saleem about Aisha, he is told <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> lied to him and that he has been double-crossed.

Al-Saleem does not believe Ferris, beats him, turns on a video camera and orders his execution. Salaam and his agents arrive at the last moment, saving Ferris' life. Al-Saleem is shown arrested in his own SUV by Marwan Se-Kia, Hani Salaam's security officer.|$|E

25|$|A {{tendency}} towards reciprocity {{implies that}} people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them. This {{has been used by}} charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity. Another method is to announce publicly <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> given a large donation. The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped. On the other hand, people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating. People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to, or their helping may not be noticed, which may cause unintended conflicts. As such, it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of non-cooperation.|$|E

Truman and the others bring Cooper to their headquarters, where James has Jacques' brother Bernard (Clay Wilcox) bound and gagged. They question Bernard but he denies any crime.|$|E
500|$|Known as Manulab to {{the people}} of Nissan Island, the white-bellied sea eagle is {{considered}} special and killing it is forbidden. Its calls at night are said to foretell danger, and seeing a group of calling eagles flying overhead is a sign <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> died. [...] Local Malay folk tales tell of the white-bellied sea eagle screaming to warn the shellfish of the turning of tides, and a local name burung hamba siput translates as [...] "slave of the shellfish". Called Kaulo in the recently extinct Aka-Bo language, the white-bellied sea eagle was held to be the ancestor of all birds in one Andaman Islands folk tale. On the Maharashtra coast, their name is kakan and its call is said to indicate the presence of fish in the sea. They sometimes nest on coconut trees.

The sheet of notepaper with the scrawled lyrics had been expected to fetch up to £80,000 at the auction, which was scheduled for 30 April 2002. McCartney went to court to stop the auction, claiming the paper had disappeared from his West London home. Richard Morgan, representing Christie's, said McCartney had provided no evidence that he had ever owned {{the piece of paper}} on which the lyrics were written. The courts decided in McCartney's favour and prohibited the sale of the lyrics. They had been sent to Christie's for auction by Frenchman Florrent Tessier, who said he purchased the piece of paper at a street market stall in London for £10 in the early 1970s. In {{the original}} catalogue for the auction, Julian Lennon had written, [...] "It's very strange to think <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> written a song about you.

[...] He also praised Williams' voice as [...] "a rich, powerful voice that rarely makes a mistake on this stunning debut." [...] BuzzFeed included the album at number 13 on their [...] "36 Pop Punk Albums You Need To Hear Before You F——ing Die" [...] list.

500|$|The story makes {{extensive}} use of the literary rule of three, featuring three chairs, three bowls of porridge, three beds, and the three title characters {{who live in the}} house. There are also three sequences of the bears discovering in turn <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> been eating from their porridge, sitting in their chairs, and finally, lying in their beds, at which point is the climax of Goldilocks being discovered. This follows three earlier sequences of Goldilocks trying the bowls of porridge, chairs, and beds successively, each time finding the third [...] "just right". Author Christopher Booker characterizes this as the [...] "dialectical three", where [...] "the first is wrong in one way, the second in another or opposite way, and only the third, in the middle, is just right." [...] Booker continues [...] "This idea that the way forward lies in finding an exact middle path between opposites is of extraordinary importance in storytelling". This concept has spread across many other disciplines, particularly developmental psychology, biology, economics and engineering where it is called the [...] "Goldilocks Principle".|$|E
500|$|The Doctor's enemies {{begin to}} orbit overhead, and the Doctor buys himself {{additional}} {{time with a}} threatening speech. He urges River to bring the TARDIS to Stonehenge while he, Amy, Rory, and the legionaries prepare. When River tries to use the TARDIS, an outside force takes control of it and pilots it to Amy's house in the present day. After River leaves the TARDIS, the scanner screen cracks in the same shape as {{the cracks in the}} universe and a menacing voice says: [...] "Silence will fall." [...] River discovers landing patterns in Amy's garden and sees <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> broken into the house. She finds in Amy's room a story book about Pandora's box and a children's book about Roman Britain. River communicates this to the Doctor, warning him that the Pandorica must be a trap, created out of Amy's memories. River identifies her current space-time coordinates—26 June 2010, the date the Doctor identified as the onset of the time energy explosion that caused the cracks in the universe ("Flesh and Stone"). The Doctor warns her to leave immediately, but she finds herself again trapped in the TARDIS as the central control console begins to go critical.|$|E

Slashdotters typically like to mock then United States Senator Ted Stevens' 2006 description of the Internet as a [...] "series of tubes" [...] or former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer's chair-throwing incident from 2005.
