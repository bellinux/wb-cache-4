The former routing was restricted to trucks only and designated as a truck route. In 1950, the bridge for Main Street over the Grand River was completed and mainline US27/M-78 was rerouted {{to use it to}} connect to Larch Street. From there north, US27/M-78 followed Larch Street supplanting the truck route, which was decommissioned at that time.|$|E

50|$|Jack heads <b>to</b> <b>Car</b> 6 {{after hearing}} a gunshot over the radio, and after rescuing Christina he {{is given a}} message by Boris: come <b>to</b> <b>Car</b> 12 as soon as possible. Jack directs Christina <b>to</b> <b>Car</b> 4 <b>to</b> search for the {{ambassador}} while he heads <b>to</b> <b>Car</b> 12. On the way <b>to</b> <b>Car</b> 12, he encounters another boss using a flamethrower. When Jack reaches Car 12, Boris demands Jack hand over the IC Chip and the ambassador. Jack is confused and states that the terrorists are holding the ambassador hostage. Boris will then shoot Billy (if he has survived to now) and the boss fight will start. (This does not happen in Scenario S.) After Boris is defeated, whether or not Billy has survived the gunshot depends on if the player gave him his bulletproof vest.|$|R
5|$|On 10 January 1985, the C5 was {{unveiled}} at a glitzy launch event but it received {{a less than}} enthusiastic reception from the British media. Its sales prospects were blighted by poor reviews and safety concerns expressed by consumer and motoring organisations. The vehicle's limitations – a short range, a maximum speed of only , a battery that ran down quickly {{and a lack of}} weatherproofing – made it impractical for most people's needs. It was marketed as an alternative <b>to</b> <b>cars</b> and bicycles, but ended up appealing to neither group of owners, and it was not available in shops until several months after its launch. Within three months of the launch, production had been slashed by 90%. Sales never picked up despite Sinclair's optimistic forecasts and production ceased entirely by August 1985. Out of 14,000 C5s made, only 5,000 were sold before its manufacturer, Sinclair Vehicles, went into receivership.|$|E
5|$|The circuit {{passed its}} final {{inspection}} in May 2016 with FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting declaring his satisfaction that the circuit {{would be ready}} {{in time for the}} race. The circuit attracted some criticism from drivers who highlighted a lack of run-off in some corners and the tight pit entry positioned at one of the fastest points on the circuit. Following problems with loose kerbs in free practice, changes were made in turns 6 and 12, where the kerbs were replaced by painted markings on the track. Further revisions were made to the pit entry ahead of qualifying, extending the white line denoting the entry lane to allow drivers more time to react <b>to</b> <b>cars</b> entering the pit.|$|E
