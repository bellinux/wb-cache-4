5|$|Earth is {{the third}} planet from <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> only object in the Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, {{especially}} <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.|$|E

5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E
5|$|Apart from meteors {{within the}} {{atmosphere}} and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west {{at a rate of}} 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Moon are approximately the same.|$|E
5|$|As a red dwarf, Gliese 876 is {{much less}} massive than the Sun: {{estimates}} suggest it has only 32% {{of the mass of}} the Sun. The surface temperature of Gliese 876 is cooler than <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> star has a smaller radius. These factors combine to make the star only 1.24% as luminous as the Sun, and most of this is at infrared wavelengths.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of Mysterium and {{with the blessing of}} the Graz school inspectors, Kepler began an ambitious program to extend and elaborate his work.

5|$|Of the 640,000 {{individual}} pixels that compose each frame, Earth {{takes up}} less than one (0.12 pixels, according to NASA). The light bands across the photograph are an artifact, the result of sunlight scattering off parts of the camera and its sunshade, due to the relative proximity between <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Earth. Voyager's point of view was approximately 32° above the ecliptic. Detailed analysis suggested that the camera also detected the Moon, although it is too faint to be visible without special processing.|$|E
5|$|Saturn is {{the sixth}} planet from <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant {{with an average}} radius about nine times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but with its larger volume Saturn is over 95 times more massive.

5|$|The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system {{comprising}} <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{objects that}} orbit it, {{either directly or}} indirectly.

5|$|The Sun's {{distance}} from Earth is about 400 times the Moon's distance, and the Sun's diameter is about 400 times the Moon's diameter. Because these ratios are approximately the same, <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Moon {{as seen from}} Earth appear to be approximately the same size: about 0.5 degree of arc in angular measure.|$|E
5|$|The {{motion of}} a star {{relative}} to the Sun can provide useful information about the origin and age {{of a star}}, {{as well as the}} structure and evolution of the surrounding galaxy. The components of motion of a star consist of the radial velocity toward or away from <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> traverse angular movement, which is called its proper motion.|$|E
5|$|Venus transits are {{historically}} {{of great}} scientific importance {{as they were}} used to gain the first realistic estimates {{of the size of the}} Solar System. Observations of the 1639 transit, combined with the principle of parallax, provided an estimate of the distance between <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Earth that was more accurate than any other up to that time. The 2012 transit provided scientists with a number of other research opportunities, particularly in the refinement of techniques to be used in the search for exoplanets.|$|E

5|$|God of War: Chains of Olympus is a third-person action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by Ready at Dawn and Santa Monica Studio, {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). It was first released for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) handheld console on March 4, 2008. The game is the fourth installment in the God of War series, the second chronologically, and a prequel to the original God of War. It is loosely based on Greek mythology and set in ancient Greece, with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls Kratos, a Spartan warrior who serves the Olympian Gods. Kratos is guided by the goddess Athena, who instructs him to find the Sun God Helios, as the Dream God Morpheus has caused many of the gods to slumber in Helios' absence. With the power of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> aid of the Titan Atlas, Morpheus and the Queen of the Underworld Persephone intend to destroy the Pillar of the World and in turn Olympus.|$|E
