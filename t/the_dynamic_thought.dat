Although the basic general ideas are well accepted most experimental evidence has an indirect nature.

Recently, a few new experimental techniques emerged that permit the observation of dynamical phenomena directly. Notably, pulsed infrared (IR) spectroscopy has been applied with great success to observe structural changes with picosecond time resolution. Using two-dimensional-IR vibrational echo chemical exchange spectroscopy Ishikawa and co-workers [Ishikawa et al. (2008), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

30|$|Our {{focus on}} freedom of {{movement}} stems from the potential ability of this dimension to conceptually distinguish between streams of thought that are more constrained (such as ruminative or goal-directed thoughts) and spontaneously unfolding streams of thought—an experience that is often intuitively considered to occur when the mind wanders. Within <b>the</b> <b>Dynamic</b> Framework of <b>Thought</b> (Christoff et al., 2016) which emphasizes how thoughts unfold over time, different sources of constraints—for example, automatic (e.g. habits, affect, salient distractors) and deliberate constraints (e.g. goal-directed focus)—dynamically influence the way thoughts unfold over time. In this model, some thought streams are more constrained (or focused on a particular topic) while other thought patterns are more “free,” i.e. {{they are less likely}} to be focused on a particular topic and will tend towards greater content variability over time (Mills, Herrera-Bennett, Faber, & Christoff, 2018). For example, night-time dreaming is considered to have low levels of constraint and thus higher degrees of freedom that are less bound to reality, compared to creative thinking which involves spontaneity but also elements of topical constraint; however, both can be considered forms of spontaneous thought (Christoff et al., 2016). Freedom of movement in thought would vary on a continuum from high to low based on the amount of net constraints that operate on <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> flow of <b>thought</b> at any moment, which can come from a variety of sources including (but not limited to) conscious or latent goal pursuits, habits, as well as perceptual or emotional demands.|$|R

5000|$|A deeper problem, {{to which}} Mandel alludes with his book Trotsky: A study in <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> of his <b>thought,</b> {{is that if}} we regard certain {{conditions}} as possible to change for the better, {{we might be able to}} change them, even if currently people believe it is impossible—whereas if we regard them as unchangeable, we are unlikely to change them at all, even although they could possibly be changed ( [...] a similar insight occurs in pragmatism).

The result of research reveals that there are different legal thought of Banjarese ulama in responding some problems in Islamic marriage.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between death and artistic creativity {{has always been}} an interesting and important point of view from which to understand the development of Western (but not only Western) art in its capacity to represent the spirit of the ages and of history, the {{relationship between}} subject and object, between artist and the reality around him. Within this perspective, German Romantic thought, which is at the beginning of Western aesthetic modernity, has a particularly significant meaning: in the poetics {{of one of the most}} important exponents of this tradition, Friedrich Hölderlin, the concept of “negative” represents <b>the</b> essential <b>dynamic</b> of <b>thought,</b> i. e. tragic dialectic, the power of dissolution and of death.
