40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores {{student perceptions}} of <b>the</b> instructional chemistry <b>laboratory</b> and <b>the</b> approaches students take when learning in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> environment. To measure student perceptions of <b>the</b> chemistry <b>laboratory,</b> a survey instrument was developed. 413 students {{responded to the}} survey during the Fall 2011 semester. Students’ perception of the usefulness of <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> in helping them learn chemistry in high school was related to several factors regarding their experiences in high school chemistry. Students’ perception of the usefulness of <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> in helping them learn chemistry in college was also measured. Reasons students provided for the usefulness of <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> were categorized. To characterize approaches to learning in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory,</b> students were interviewed midway through semester (N= 18). The interviews were used to create a framework describing learning approaches that students use in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> environment. Students were categorized into three levels: students who view <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> as a requirement, students who believe that <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> augments their understanding, and students who view <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> as an important part of science. These categories describe the types of strategies students used when conducting experiments. To further explore the relationship between students’ perception of <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> and their approaches to learning, two case studies are described. These case studies involve interviews in {{the beginning and end of}} the semester. In the interviews, students reflect on what they have learned in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> and describe their perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> environment. In order to encourage students to adopt higher-level approaches to learning in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory,</b> a metacognitive intervention was created. The intervention involved supplementary questions that students would answer while completing <b>laboratory</b> experiments. <b>The</b> questions were designed to encourage students to think critically about <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> procedures. In order to test the effects of the intervention, an experimental group (N= 87) completed these supplementary questions during two laboratory experiments while a control group (N= 84) performed the same experiments without these additional questions. The effects of <b>the</b> intervention on <b>laboratory</b> exam performance were measured. Students in the experimental group had a higher average on <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> exam than students in the control group...|$|R
5|$|Animals used by {{laboratories}} {{are largely}} supplied by specialist dealers. Sources differ for vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Most laboratories breed and raise flies and worms themselves, using strains and mutants supplied {{from a few}} main stock centers. For vertebrates, sources include breeders and dealers like Covance and Charles River Laboratories who supply purpose-bred and wild-caught animals; businesses that trade in wild animals such as Nafovanny; and dealers who supply animals sourced from pounds, auctions, and newspaper ads. Animal shelters also supply <b>the</b> <b>laboratories</b> directly. Large centers also exist to distribute strains of genetically modified animals; the International Knockout Mouse Consortium, for example, aims to provide knockout mice for every gene in the mouse genome.|$|E
5|$|During the {{transition}} period {{he worked as a}} pathology registrar at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and also prepared for his Doctor of Medicine examinations, late in 1923. In 1923 he took up the post of senior resident pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital; <b>the</b> <b>laboratories</b> were a part of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He conducted research into the agglutinin reactions in typhoid fever, leading to his first scientific publications. He decided to work full-time on the antibody response in typhoid, even though he was technically supposed to pursuing pathology as part of his obligations to the hospital. Burnet came first in the Doctor of Medicine exams by a long distance, and his score was excluded from the scaling process so that the other students would not fail for being so far behind.|$|E
5|$|Kistiakowsky {{was unhappy}} {{with the state of}} American {{knowledge}} of explosives and propellants. Conant established the Explosives Research Laboratory (ERL) near <b>the</b> <b>laboratories</b> of the Bureau of Mines in Bruceton, Pennsylvania in October 1940, and Kistiakowsky initially supervised its activities, making occasional visits; but Conant did not formally appoint him as its Technical Director until the spring of 1941. Although initially hampered by a shortage of facilities, the ERL grew from five staff in 1941 to a wartime peak of 162 full-time laboratory staff in 1945. An important field of research was RDX. This powerful explosive had been developed by the British before the war. The challenge was to develop an industrial process that could produce it on a large scale. RDX was also mixed with TNT to produce Composition B, which was widely used in various munitions, and torpex, which was used in torpedoes and depth charges. Pilot plants were in operation by May 1942, and large-scale production followed in 1943.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{external}} validity of emotional value measured in economic laboratory experiments {{by using a}} physiological indicator of stress, heart rate variability (HRV). While {{there is ample evidence}} supporting the external validity of economic experiments, there is little evidence comparing the magnitude of internal levels of emotional stress during decision making with external stress. The current study addresses this gap by comparing the magnitudes of decision stress experienced in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> with <b>the</b> stress from outside <b>the</b> <b>laboratory.</b> To quantify a large change in HRV, measures observed in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> during decision-making are compared to the difference between HRV during a university exam and other mental activity for the same individuals in and outside of <b>the</b> <b>laboratory.</b> <b>The</b> results outside <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> inform about <b>the</b> relevance of <b>laboratory</b> findings in terms of their relative magnitude. Results show that psychologically induced HRV changes observed in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory,</b> particularly in connection with social preferences, correspond to large effects outside. This underscores the external validity of laboratory findings and shows the magnitude of emotional value connected to pro-social economic decisions in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory...</b>|$|R
5|$|Neddermeyer {{discarded}} Serber and Tolman's initial {{concept of}} implosion as assembling {{a series of}} pieces in favor of one in which a hollow sphere was imploded by an explosive shell. He was assisted in this work by Hugh Bradner, Charles Critchfield, and John Streib. L. T. E. Thompson was brought in as a consultant, and discussed the problem with Neddermeyer in June 1943. Thompson was skeptical that an implosion could be made sufficiently symmetric. Oppenheimer arranged for Neddermeyer and Edwin McMillan to visit the National Defense Research Committee's Explosives Research Laboratory near <b>the</b> <b>laboratories</b> of the Bureau of Mines in Bruceton, Pennsylvania (a Pittsburgh suburb), where they spoke to George Kistiakowsky and his team. But Neddermeyer's efforts in July and August at imploding tubes to produce cylinders tended to produce objects that resembled rocks. Neddermeyer {{was the only person}} who believed that implosion was practical, and only his enthusiasm kept the project alive.|$|E

5|$|Four {{universities}} {{provided the}} locations where the experiments were taking place.

It was run by Peierls, {{with the help of}} fellow German refugee scientist Klaus Fuchs. <b>The</b> <b>laboratories</b> at the University of Liverpool and the University of Oxford experimented with different types of isotope separation. Chadwick's group at Liverpool dealt with thermal diffusion, which worked {{based on the assumption that}} different isotopes of uranium are attracted to different temperatures. Franz Simon's group at Oxford investigated the gaseous diffusion of isotopes. This method works on the principle that at differing pressures uranium 235 would diffuse through a barrier faster than uranium 238. Eventually the most promising method of separation was gaseous diffusion. Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather's group at Cambridge investigated whether another element, now called plutonium, could be used as an explosive compound. Because of the French scientists, Oxford also obtained the world's only supply of heavy water, which helped them theorise how uranium could be used for power.|$|E

5|$|With an {{interest}} in pathology, Stansfield spent {{the last few months}} of his time in Edinburgh working at the Royal Infirmary. In 1889, the London County Council (LCC) was established and took over the running of several London mental asylums; in the process, it advertised for a Fourth Assistant Medical Officer and Pathologist at Banstead Asylum, essentially a junior assistant with pathological duties which often related to postmortems. Stansfield successfully applied for the position. While at Banstead, he became interested in the pathology of mental illness and asylum administration. Accustomed to <b>the</b> <b>laboratories</b> at Edinburgh and drilled in rigorous note-taking skills, he set about instilling similar facilities and ethos at Banstead under the auspices of its superintendent, Dr T. Claye Shaw. Each ward would also have its own fixed notebook for medical officers, a practice which over time spread to all other asylums in the country. Thanks to this and his enjoying good relations with its steward, F. Alderton, Stansfield was made Banstead's Second Assistant Medical Officer in 1890 and, when Claybury Asylum opened in 1892–93, he was transferred there as First Assistant Medical Officer, helped by Claye Shaw's influence at the LCC. Over the course of the 1890s, he visited numerous domestic and foreign institutions, travelling to Germany and the United States.|$|E
