40|$|The metal-to-metal {{clearances}} of a {{steam turbine}} during full or part load operation {{are among the}} main drivers of efficiency. The requirement to add clearances is driven {{by a number of}} factors including the relative movements of the steam <b>turbine</b> <b>shell</b> and rotor during transient conditions such as startup and shutdown. This paper includes a description of a control algorithm to manage external heating blankets for the thermal control of the shell deflections during turbine shutdown. The proposed method is tolerant of changes in the heat loss characteristics of the system as well as simultaneous component failures. Comment: Six pages, nine figures, and one tabl...|$|E
25|$|The surface {{condenser}} is a {{shell and tube}} heat exchanger in which cooling water is circulated through the tubes. The exhaust steam from the low-pressure <b>turbine</b> enters the <b>shell,</b> where it is cooled and converted to condensate (water) by flowing over the tubes {{as shown in the}} adjacent diagram. Such condensers use steam ejectors or rotary motor-driven exhausts for continuous removal of air and gases from the steam side to maintain vacuum.|$|R
50|$|Ships can be {{customised}} {{through the}} addition of various equipment within their empty slots, which add attribute bonuses and even provide special effects in some cases; such equipment include naval guns, anti-aircraft guns, torpedoes, torpedo bombers, dive bombers, fighter aircraft, seaplanes, recon planes, radars, steam <b>turbines,</b> special artillery <b>shells,</b> depth charges, sonars, drum canisters, searchlights and anti-torpedo bulges. The effectiveness of ships in combat depend on its attribute parameters, namely hitpoints, armour, evasion, aircraft capacity, speed, attack range, firepower, torpedo, anti-air, anti-submarine, line-of-sight, and luck.|$|R
