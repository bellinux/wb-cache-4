5|$|An {{alternative}} mourning {{style is}} <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> spherical finial with black cloth {{and place a}} black ribbon, known as a , above the flag. This style {{dates back to the}} death of Emperor Meiji on July 30, 1912, and the Cabinet issued an ordinance stipulating that the national flag should be raised in mourning when the Emperor dies. The Cabinet has the authority to announce the half-staffing of the national flag.|$|E
5|$|Playing {{his first}} Test in the West Indies since his debut series, Kohli scored 200 {{in the first}} Test at Antigua to ensure an innings-and-92-run win for India, their biggest win ever outside of Asia. It was his first double hundred in {{first-class}} cricket and the first made away from home by an Indian captain in Tests. India went on <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> series 2–0 and briefly top the ICC Test Rankings before being displaced by Pakistan at the position. He scored another double hundred–211 at Indore in the third Test against New Zealand–as India's 3–0 whitewash victory saw them regain the top position in the ICC Test Rankings. In the subsequent ODI series, Kohli set up two wins for India batting second with unbeaten knocks of 85 at Dharamsala and 134-ball 154 at Mohali, his second highest ODI score. He then made 65 in the series-deciding fifth game at Visakhapatnam which India won.|$|E
5|$|Populations from Los Baños {{and from}} Sagada, {{both in the}} Philippines, have {{slightly}} different hunting tactics, and Los Baños has some very dangerous prey spiders. In laboratory tests, Los Baños P. labiatas rely more on trial and error than Sagada P. labiatas in finding ways to vibrate the prey's web and thus lure or distract the prey. Around Los Baños the web-building Scytodes pallida, which preys on jumping spiders, is very abundant. All members of the genus Scytodes spit a sticky gum on prey and potential threats, and this can immobilise a Portia {{long enough for the}} Scytodes <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> Portia in silk and then bite it. Around Los Baños, P. labiata instinctively detours round the back of S. pallida that is not carrying eggs while with plucking the web {{in a way that makes}} S. pallida believe the threat is in front of it. P. labiata prefers to stalk a female S. pallida carrying eggs, as then S. pallida is reluctant to drop the eggs in order to spit, and in this case P. labiata sometimes uses a direct attack. In areas where S. pallida is absent, the local members of P. labiata do not use this combination of plucking other spiders' webs to deceive the prey and detouring for a stab in the back.|$|E

25|$|The sling, the {{material}} used to wrap {{around the tree}} as the anchor, is generally a simple piece of webbing for basic slacklines. More advanced slacklines are commonly rigged using industrial round slings <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> trees for increased strength and durability.|$|E
25|$|Scrolls can {{be rolled}} {{in one of}} two ways. The first method is <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> scroll around a single core, similar to a modern roll of paper towels. While simple to construct, a single core scroll has a major disadvantage: in order to read text {{at the end of the}} scroll, the entire scroll must be unwound. This is {{partially}} overcome in the second method, which is <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> scroll around two cores, as in a Torah. With a double scroll, the text can be accessed from both beginning and end, and the portions of the scroll not being read can remain wound. This still leaves the scroll a sequential-access medium: to reach a given page, one generally has to unroll and re-roll many other pages.|$|E

25|$|By {{the tenth}} century, the Persians, who had {{converted}} to Islam, began weaving inscriptions onto elaborately patterned silks. So precious were calligraphic inscribed textiles that Crusaders {{brought them to}} Europe as prized possessions.

25|$|Although {{not usually}} {{stated in the}} score, timpanists will change sticks to suit {{the nature of the}} music. However, the choice during a {{performance}} is subjective and depends on the timpanist's preference and occasionally the wishes of the conductor. Thus, most timpanists own a great number of sticks. The weight of the stick, size and latent surface area of the head, materials used for the shaft, core, and wrap, and method used <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> head all contribute to the timbre the stick produces.|$|E

25|$|Others {{started looking}} for ways to {{stabilise}} the plasma during compression, and by 1953 two concepts had come to the fore. One solution was <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> vacuum tube in a sheet of thin but highly conductive metal. If the plasma column began to move, the current in the plasma would induce a magnetic field in the sheet, one that, due to Lenz's law, would push back against the plasma. This was most effective against large, slow movements, like the entire plasma torus drifting within the chamber.|$|E
25|$|Both women {{allegedly}} helped <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> {{body in a}} napkin. They kept some of {{the clothes}} Marmon had packed; the rest was destined for the pawnbroker. Dyer paid the rent to the unwitting landlady, {{and gave her a}} pair of child's boots as a present for her little girl. The following day, Wednesday 1 April 1896, another child, named Harry Simmons, was taken to Mayo Road. However, with no spare white edging tape available, the length around Doris' corpse was removed and used to strangle the 13-month-old boy.|$|E
25|$|Maniaq (lit. «roasted thing») is roasted (barbecued) over an {{open fire}} fish. All parts of the fish except the guts are used.

25|$|In China, {{a legend}} {{indicates}} {{the discovery of}} the silkworm's silk was by an ancient empress Lei Zu, the wife of the Yellow Emperor and the daughter of XiLing-Shi. She was drinking tea under a tree when a silk cocoon fell into her tea. As she picked it out and started <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> silk thread around her finger, she slowly felt a warm sensation. When the silk ran out, she saw a small larva. In an instant, she realized this caterpillar larva was the source of the silk. She taught this to the people and it became widespread. Many more legends about the silkworm are told.|$|E
25|$|The Auditorium {{was built}} for a {{syndicate}} of businessmen to house a large civic opera house; to provide an economic base it was decided <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> auditorium with a hotel and office block. Hence Adler & Sullivan had to plan a complex multiple-use building. Fronting on Michigan Avenue, overlooking the lake, was the hotel (now Roosevelt University) while the offices were placed to the west on Wabash Avenue. The entrance to the auditorium is {{on the south side}} beneath the tall blocky eighteen-story tower. The rest of the building is a uniform ten stories, organized {{in the same way as}} Richardson's Marshall Field Wholesale Store. The interior embellishment, however, is wholly Sullivan's, and some of the details, because of their continuous curvilinear foliate motifs, are among the nearest equivalents to European Art Nouveau architecture.|$|E

25|$|After 32 years, Christo and Jeanne-Claude wrapped 178 {{trees in}} Berower Park/Beyeler Foundation {{north-east}} of Basel between 13 November and 14 December 1998. <b>To</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> trees, the couple used 55,000 m2 of silver-grey shiny polyester fabric and 23km of rope. A pattern {{had to be}} made for each individual tree and so the natural shape of the branches pushed the fabric outwards, creating individual shapes in the sky. The trees varied in height from 2 to 25 meters and in width from 1 to nearly 15 meters. As with their other projects, this was financed by the sale of original works. On view for three weeks, Wrapped Trees was extremely dynamic: varying silhouettes of trees moved in the wind with the skeletal framework of branches made visible when the translucent material was backlit by the sun. All materials used in this project were recycled when it was taken down.|$|E
25|$|Line markers are {{generally}} used on permanent guidelines to provide critical information to divers following the line. The slots and notches provided are used <b>to</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>the</b> line {{to secure the}} marker in place. A simple passage of the line through the enlarged area {{at the base of}} the two slots will allow the marker to slide along the line, or even fall off if brushed by a diver. To more securely fasten the marker, an extra wrap may be added at each slot. The basic function of these markers is fairly consistent internationally, but procedures may differ by region, and between teams. The protocol for placement and removal should be well understood by the members of a specific team. Temporary line markers are only for the use of the team who placed them and are removed during exit to avoid littering a cave system with irrelevant and potentially confusing information.|$|E
