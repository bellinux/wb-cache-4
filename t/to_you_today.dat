500|$|Tintin in the Congo {{has been}} criticised as {{presenting}} the Africans as naïve and primitive. In the original work, Tintin is shown at a blackboard addressing {{a class of}} African children. [...] "My dear friends," [...] he says, [...] "I am going to talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>today</b> about your fatherland: Belgium." [...] Hergé redrew this in 1946 to show a lesson in mathematics. Hergé later admitted the flaws in the original story, excusing it saying, [...] "I portrayed these Africans according to... this purely paternalistic spirit of the time." [...] Sue Buswell, who was the editor of Tintin at Methuen, summarised the perceived problems with the book in 1988 as [...] "all to do with rubbery lips and heaps of dead animals", although Thompson noted her quote may have been [...] "taken out of context".|$|E

2500|$|The slowpaced Madrid {{talks were}} upstaged {{by a series}} of secret {{meetings}} between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators hosted by Norway. These meetings produced the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords between Palestinians and Israel, a plan discussing the necessary elements and conditions for a future Palestinian state [...] "on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338". The agreement, officially titled the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements (DOP), was signed on the White House lawn on 13 September 1993. Rabin, Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres were awarded the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts. On behalf of the Israeli people, Rabin said: [...] "We who have fought against you, the Palestinians, we say <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>today,</b> in a loud and a clear voice, enough of blood and tears ... enough!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Criticisms {{about the}} {{evidence}} {{used to justify}} the war notwithstanding, many opponents of military intervention objected, saying that a diplomatic solution would be preferable, and that war should be reserved as a truly last resort. This position was exemplified by French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin, who responded to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell's 5 February 2003 presentation to the U.N Security Council by saying that: [...] "Given the choice between military intervention and an inspections regime that is inadequate because of a failure to cooperate on Iraq's part, we must choose the decisive reinforcement {{of the means of}} inspections." [...] In response to Donald Rumsfeld's reference to European countries that did not support the invasion of Iraq as 'Old Europe', Dominique de Villepin ended his speech with words that would later come to embody the French-German political, economic, and military alliance throughout the beginning of the 21st Century: [...] "This message comes <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>today</b> from an old country, France, from a continent like mine, Europe, that has known wars, occupation and barbarity. (...) Faithful to its values, it wishes resolutely to act with {{all the members of the}} international community. It believes in our ability to build together a better world." [...] The direct opposition between diplomatic solution and military intervention involving France and the United States which was personified by Chirac versus Bush and later Powell versus de Villepin, became a milestone in the Franco-American relations. Anti-French propaganda exploiting the classic Francophobic clichés immediately ensued in the United States and the United Kingdom. A call for a boycott on French wine was launched in the United States and the New York Post covered on the 1944 [...] "Sacrifice" [...] of the GIs that France had forgotten. It was followed a week later, on 20 February, by the British newspaper The Sun publishing a special issue entitled [...] "Chirac is a worm" [...] and including ad hominem attacks such as [...] "Jacques Chirac has become the shame of Europe". Actually both newspapers expressed the opinion of their owner, U.S. billionaire Rupert Murdoch, a military intervention supporter and a George W. Bush partisan as argued by Roy Greenslade in The Guardian published on 17 February.|$|E
