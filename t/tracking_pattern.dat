This aided searching, as it did not need to pass directly overhead. [...] A zig-zag search pattern was flown, passing at right-angles over the likely direction of submarine movements. When an exhaust plume was detected, the aircraft would begin to fly a <b>tracking</b> <b>pattern</b> of progressively shorter zig-zags. Each crossing of the plume trail would be plotted, giving a map plot of the submarine's likely track. As the track was narrowed down, the aircraft would switch sensors to a more precise method, such as centimetric radar or dropping sonobuoys before potentially closing for an attack.|$|E
5000|$|Structure {{detection}} {{forms the}} most fundamental part of NARMAX. For example a NARMAX model which consists of one lagged input and one lagged output term, three lagged noise terms, expanded as a cubic polynomial would consist of fifty six possible candidate terms. This number of candidate terms arises because the expansion by definition includes all possible combinations within the cubic expansion. Naively proceeding to estimate a model which includes all these terms and then pruning will cause numerical and computational problems and should always be avoided. However, only a few terms are often important in the model. Structure detection, which aims to select terms one at a time, is therefore critically important. These objectives can easily be achieved by using the Orthogonal Least Squares [...] algorithm and its derivatives to select the NARMAX model terms one at a time. These ideas can also be adapted for pattern recognition and feature selection and provide an alternative to principal component analysis but with the advantage that the features are revealed as basis functions that are easily related {{back to the original}} problem. NARMAX methods are designed to do far more than to just find the best approximating model. System identification can be divided into two aims. The first involves approximation where the key aim is to develop a model that approximates the data set such that good predictions can be made. There are many applications where this approach is appropriate, for example in time series prediction of the weather, stock prices, speech, target <b>tracking,</b> <b>pattern</b> classification etc. In such applications the form of the model is not that important. The objective is to find an approximation scheme which produces the minimum prediction errors. A second objective of system identification, which includes the first objective as a subset, involves much more than just finding a model to achieve the best mean squared errors. This second aim is why the NARMAX philosophy was developed and is linked to the idea of finding the simplest model structure. The aim here is to develop models that reproduce the dynamic characteristics of the underlying system, to find the simplest possible model, and if possible to relate this to components and behaviours of the system under study. The core aim of this second approach to identification is therefore to identify and reveal the rule that represents the system. These objectives are relevant to model simulation and control systems design, but increasingly to applications in medicine, neuro science, and the life sciences. Here the aim is to identify models, often nonlinear, {{that can be used to}} understand the basic mechanisms of how these systems operate and behave so that we can manipulate and utilise these. NARMAX methods have also been developed in the frequency and spatio-temporal domains.|$|E
40|$|AbstractE-learning is an {{innovation}} technology {{with the aim}} to provide a strategy {{to improve the quality}} of teaching and learning. The establishment of LMS is to improve the teaching and learning environments and to have better learning delivering through electronic device. The interface design of LMS plays an important role to deliver the learning process to both learners and educators. The usability of LMS is an important criterion for providing an effective and easy learning environment. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate user interface design of LMS by analyzing student's eye <b>tracking</b> <b>pattern</b> though the gaze plot and heat map. The interface of LMS was divided into three area; top, left and content. Student's area of interest was identified using the eye tracing pattern.

Three {{tests were conducted}} in which artificial faults were injected {{into one of the}} ailerons, and into the roll rate signal during a roll angle <b>tracking</b> <b>pattern.</b> After these three tests, there was time and batteries for one more test, so a new waypoint <b>tracking</b> <b>pattern</b> was successfully tested. All flight ops ran smoothly. Software used for this flight was trunk/Software/FlightCode rev 907 Each of the three fault detection tests consisted of six different fault cases, each being repeated 3 times. The first two cases were unfaulted scenarios to compare to. The next four cases inject an aileron fault 7 seconds after autopilot (A/P) is engaged, and a - 80 deg/sec roll rate impulse fault 12 seconds after A/P is engaged. The third case aileron fault is a ramp of 5 degrees for 13 seconds. Case four is a 13 second, 10 degree right aileron fault.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} examine {{the influence of the}} strength of perceptionaction coupling on the control and learning of a visuomotor <b>tracking</b> <b>pattern.</b> Participants produced rhythmic elbow flexion-extension motions to learn a visually defined 90 ? relative phase <b>tracking</b> <b>pattern</b> with an external sinusoidal signal which was set at 0. 8 Hz with 8 cycles in a trial. Day 1 and Day 2 practice sessions consisted of a total of 72 practice trials. There were two visuomotor congruency groups, a congruent group with visual feedback representing the elbow?s rotation and an incongruent group with feedback representing the elbow?s rotation transformed by 180 ?. Before Day 1 practice (pre-practice) and 24 hours after Day 2 practice (post-practice), participants produced 0 ?, 45 ?, 90 ?, 135 ?, and 180 ? relative phase tracking patterns either with or without tracking feedback. The external signal and the limb?s feedback were provided in the same workspace in Experiment 1, while both signals were provided in a separate workspace in Experiment 2. The pre-practice results demonstrated that the 0 ? relative phase pattern was the most accurate and stable pattern, whereas the 90 ? and 135 ? relative phase patterns were less accurate and more variable. The incongruent group produced a more accurate and less variable 180 ? relative phase pattern compared to the congruent group. Practice led to a decrease in phase error and variability toward the required 90 ? relative phase pattern in both experiments. The congruent group produced more accurate tracking and less variable elbow amplitude compared to the incongruent group in the separate workspace, whereas no such congruency effects were found in the same workspace during practice. The post-practice results showed overall improvements in phase accuracy and stability in most relative phase patterns with practice. Overall deterioration in tracking performance was found when tracking without feedback in the pre- and post-practice sessions. These findings demonstrated that the perception-action coupling strength was modified by feedback, visuomotor mapping, perceptual pattern, and workspace framework. The differential strength of perception-action impacted the learning of the required visuomotor <b>tracking</b> <b>pattern</b> as well as the production of tracking accuracy and stability differentially among the other tracking patterns...|$|E

Recent extensions to correlation filters, such as MOSSE, have reignited interest of their use in the vision community due to their robustness and attractive computational properties. In this paper we demonstrate, however, that this computational efficiency comes at a cost. Specifically, we demonstrate that only 1 D proportion of shifted examples are unaffected by boundary effects which has a dramatic effect on detection/tracking performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to correlation filter estimation that: (i) takes advantage of inherent computational redundancies in the frequency domain, and (ii) dramatically reduces boundary effects.
