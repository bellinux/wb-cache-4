40|$|Abstract. Flexural {{motion of}} a {{cantilever}} bar {{can be used}} to monitor the taper angle measurements of the bar without incorporating any geometric measurement. This provides non-destructive taper measurement with fast processing in manufacturing line. The laser ablation of a free end of the cantilever bar enables to generate a recoil pressure at the irradiated surface while resulting in external forcing function for the initiation of the flexural motion. Consequently, in the present study, laser induced ablation of free end <b>tapered</b> cantilever <b>bar</b> and resulting displacement and frequency of the flexural motion is examined. The study is extended to include influence of positive and negative <b>bar</b> <b>taper</b> angles on the flexural characteristics. In addition, deviation of displacement and frequency of the flexural motion due to <b>tapered</b> <b>bar</b> from the parallel bar is examined. It is found that the flexural characteristics of the <b>tapered</b> <b>bar</b> enable to determine taper angle of the bar with high accuracy...|$|R
40|$|A general {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for determining the}} dynamic torsional/axial response of linear structures composed of either <b>tapered</b> <b>bars</b> or shafts to transient excitations. The method consists of formulating and solving the dynamic problem in the Laplace transform domain by the finite element method and obtaining the response by a numerical inversion of the transformed solution. The derivation of the torsional and axial stiffness matrices {{is based on the}} exact solution of the transformed governing equation of motion, and it consequently leads to the exact solution of the problem. The solution permits treatment of the most practical cases of linear <b>tapered</b> <b>bars</b> and shafts, and employs modeling of structures with only one element per member which reduces the number of degrees of freedom involved. The effects of external viscous or internal viscoelastic damping are also taken into account...|$|R

40|$|For further {{development}} in beam quality of high power diode laser systems {{a new type}} of diode laser bars has been realized recently. Compared to commercially available broad area diode laser bars the lateral design of <b>tapered</b> diode laser <b>bars</b> consists of a ridge waveguide and a tapered section, where the tapered structure determines high output power and the high brightness is provided by the ridge waveguide structure. Unfortunately the different lateral structure leads to astigmatism effects which are also thermally affected in continuous wave operation. Hence in terms of diode laser systems with essentially fast- and slow-axis collimation micro-optics the full characterization of <b>tapered</b> diode laser <b>bars</b> is necessary. Where the wavelengths and divergences of <b>tapered</b> diode <b>bars</b> are relatively easy to measure, the beam profile with its apparently inside the tapered structure located lateral source is not. With a telecentric optics the caustic of the individual emitters of the bars are detected by the use of a fiber sensor with a resolution of 10 ?m in fast- and slow-axis direction. Subsequently with beam analysis software the astigmatism can be calculated. As a result of several measurements of <b>tapered</b> <b>bars</b> of different wavelengths we detected good homogeneity over the bar concerning the amount of astigmatism but a slight current dependency. So particularly with regard to beam shaping micro-optics the application to high power diode laser systems seems to be sophisticated so far...|$|R

40|$|Whilst the {{dynamics}} of tapered structures have been extensively studied numerically and analytically, very few experimental results have been presented to date. The main aim {{of this paper is}} to derive and demonstrate an experimental method enabling both axial and flexural wavenumbers in exponentially <b>tapered</b> <b>bars</b> to be estimated. Our particular interest in this type of tapering is motivated by its occurrence in naturally grown structures such as tree roots, with an outlook towards remote root mapping. Decomposing a dynamic response into a sum of contributing waves, we propose a method in which two independent wavenumbers can be calculated from five equispaced measurements. The approach was demonstrated in an experiment on a freely suspended wooden specimen supported by theoretical modelling. For axial waves we used the well-established elementary rod theory, whereas for flexural waves we build a piecewise uniform model based on the Timoshenko beam theory. The estimates calculated from the experimental data were compared with the analytical and numerical results and showed good agreement. The limitations of the method include an appropriate choice of sensor spacing, the effect of sensor misalignments and the assumption of small wavenumber variation for flexural waves...|$|R
40|$|Force fields {{computed}} {{directly from}} strains calculated in a displacement type finite element {{description of a}} structural element of varying sectional rigidities show extraneous oscillations. The origin of these oscillations is traced {{to the fact that}} the displacement type finite element procedure determines strains derived from the displacement field in a least squares correct sense and that force resultants computed using these strain fields and the actual sectional rigidities result in unwanted oscillations. It is necessary to introduce the concept of redistributed assumed force resultant fields that maintain a 'consistent' relationship 13; to the strain fields and also are orthogonal to these strain functions. In this paper, the Hu-Washizu theorem is invoked to justify the introduction of an orthogonally correct reconstituted assumed force resultant field which will then be free of extraneous oscillations. The quadratic isoparametric <b>tapered</b> <b>bar</b> element serves to illustrate the underlying principles. 13; It follows that the extremely general Hu-Washizu principle is the most practical procedure of implementing an assumed force resultant, assumed strain displacement type formulation to introduce consistency and thereby remove problems associated with field-inconsistency (such as cause locking in constrained media elasticity) and force resultant oscillations due to varying sectional properties...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} few years high power diode laser arrays have become well {{established}} for direct material processing due to their high efficiency of more than 50 %. But standard broad-area waveguide designs are susceptible to modal instabilities and filamentations resulting in low beam qualities. The beam quality increases by more than a factor of four by using tapered laser arrays, but so far they suffer from lower efficiencies. Therefore tapered lasers are mainly used today as single emitters in external resonator configurations. With increased output power and lifetime, they will be much more attractive for material processing and for pumping of fiber amplifiers. High efficiency <b>tapered</b> mini <b>bars</b> emitting at a wavelength of 980 nm are developed, and in order to qualify the bars, the characteristics of single emitters and mini bars from the same wafer have been compared. The mini bars have a width of 6 mm with 12 emitters. The ridge waveguide tapered lasers consist of a 500 Âµm long ridge and a 2000 Âµm long tapered section. The results show very similar behavior of the electro-optical characteristics and the beam quality for single emitters and bars. Due to different junction temperatures, different slope efficiencies were measured: 0. 8 W/A for passively cooled mini bars and 1. 0 W/A for actively cooled mini-bars and single emitters. The threshold current of 0. 7 A per emitter is the same for single emitters and emitter arrays.
