5|$|Puglia {{was built}} by the new Regia Marina {{shipyard}} in Taranto, the first major warship to be built there. Her keel was laid down in October 1893, and she was launched on 22 September 1898.

By this time, her design was over ten years old and the ship was rapidly becoming obsolescent; in comparison, Germany had already commissioned the world's first light cruisers, the , which were significantly faster and better armed. This new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> rapidly replaced protected cruisers like Puglia.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of its target value and vulnerability, {{aircraft}} carriers are always escorted by at least one submarine for protection. The other vessels in the Strike Group provide additional capabilities, such as long range Tomahawk missiles or the Aegis Combat System, and also protect the carrier from attack. A typical Strike Group may include, in addition to an aircraft carrier: up to six surface combatants, including frigates (since retired from USN service), guided missile cruisers and guided missile destroyers (used primarily for anti-aircraft warfare and anti-submarine warfare); one or two attack submarines (for seeking out and destroying hostile surface ships and submarines); and an ammunition, oiler, and supply ship of Military Sealift Command to provide logistical support.

5|$|An ironclad is a steam-propelled warship {{protected}} by iron or steel armor plates {{used in the}} early part of the second half of the 19th century. The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells. The first ironclad battleship, , was launched by the French Navy in November 1859. The British Admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an armored corvette in 1857; in early 1859 the Royal Navy started building two iron-hulled armored frigates, and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all-armored battle fleet. After the first clashes of ironclads (both with wooden ships and with one another) took place in 1862 during the American Civil War, it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> would come to be very successful in the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Ark Royal was recommissioned in 1930 {{to serve}} as a {{training}} ship, for seaplane pilots and to evaluate aircraft catapult operations and techniques. She was renamed HMS Pegasus in 1934, freeing the name for the aircraft carrier ordered that year, and continued {{to serve as}} a training ship until the beginning of the Second World War in September 1939. Assigned to the Home Fleet {{at the beginning of the}} war, she took on tasks as an aircraft transport, in addition to her training duties, until she was modified to serve as the prototype fighter catapult ship in late 1940. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> was intended to defend convoys against attacks by German long-range maritime patrol bombers by launching fighters via their catapult to provide air cover for the convoy. Pegasus served in this role until mid-1941 when she reverted to her previous duties as a training ship. This lasted until early 1944 when she became a barracks ship. The ship was sold in late 1946 and her conversion into a merchant ship began the following year. However, the owner ran out of money during the process and Anita I, as she had been renamed, was seized by her creditors in 1949 and sold for scrap. She was not broken up until late 1950.|$|E

25|$|With {{the rise}} of Rome the biggest fleet of quinqueremes {{temporarily}} ruled the Mediterranean, but during the civil wars after Caesar's death the fleet was {{on the wrong side}} and a new warfare with light liburnas was developed.

25|$|The Vikings were {{equipped}} with the technologically superior longships; for purposes of conducting trade however, another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship,</b> the knarr, wider and deeper in draft, were customarily used. The Vikings were competent sailors, adept in land warfare {{as well as at}} sea, and they often struck at accessible and poorly defended targets, usually with near impunity. The effectiveness of these tactics earned Vikings a formidable reputation as raiders and pirates. Chroniclers paid little attention to other aspects of medieval Scandinavian culture. This slant was accentuated by the absence of contemporary primary source documentation from within the Viking Age communities themselves. Little documentary evidence was available until later, when Christian sources began to contribute. As historians and archaeologists have developed more resources to challenge the one-sided descriptions of the chroniclers, a more balanced picture of the Norsemen has become apparent.|$|E

Considered by some to be more [...] "Dreadnought-type coast-defense ships" [...] than pure battleships, the three ships of the class were built in Ferrol by Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval (SECN), the lead ship being completed in under four years, but the onset of World War I resulted in delays to the remaining two ships, and especially the third, as equipment and armament deliveries from England were disrupted due to the war.|$|E
500|$|After {{the end of}} the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, the Russian Naval General Staff {{decided that}} it needed a {{squadron}} of fast [...] "armored cruisers" [...] that could use their speed to maneuver into position to engage the head of the enemy's battle line, much as Admiral Tōgō had done during the Battle of Tsushima against the Russian fleet. This concept was very different from the primary roles for the battlecruiser envisioned by the British Royal Navy and the Imperial German High Seas Fleet, which consisted of scouting for the main battle fleet and attacking enemy reconnaissance forces. The Royal Navy came to the same conclusion and developed the [...] fast battleships that could force battle on an enemy fleet and had enough protection to attack any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship.</b> However, World War I and the Russian Civil War interrupted the construction of the Russian Borodino-class ships and all were scrapped.|$|E

500|$|At first unconvinced of the {{importance}} of the superior speed of the British battlecruisers, the US Navy changed its position after evaluating the new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> in fleet exercises and [...] Naval War College wargames, and after the Japanese acquisition of four s in the early 1910s. The Secretary of the Navy initially refused the General Board's suggested procurement of several battlecruisers, but fleet exercises revealed that the Navy lacked forces that could effectively find and track an enemy fleet in any weather, and a consensus gradually emerged that battlecruisers would be ideal for this role. Battlecruisers were effective when concentrating their fire on an enemy fleet's leading ships, as the Japanese armored cruisers had done to the Russians at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. Another role envisioned was tracking down and destroying enemy commerce raiders. British experience during the Battle of the Falkland Islands in late 1914 and the Battle of Dogger Bank the following year, where British battlecruisers caught and destroyed German armored cruisers, confirmed all these capabilities.|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} rolls {{were done with}} roughly {{the same amount of}} detail while the lesser rowbarges (essentially small galleys) were done more hastily.

Overall, the ships follow a formula depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship.</b> The exceptions are stern galleries of some of the galleasses and the figureheads of the Mary Rose, Salamander and the Unicorn, the latter both captured from the Scots in 1544. The prominent exception is the Galley Subtle placed {{in the middle of the}} second roll. It is more consistent in type with Mediterranean-type galleys than the galleasses and small rowbarges, and features a considerable amount of detail not present in the other ships. It is the only ship where any crew is visible, in this case rowers behind pavisades as protection from enemy arrows and an overseer wearing [...] "a bonnet, full skirted armorial doublet and baggy breeches" [...] holding a stick or baton, as if beating the time of the strokes of the rowers.|$|E
