25|$|In {{reaction}} to the power at court of the ultra-Catholic Guise, La Renaudie, a Protestant gentleman of Périgord, perhaps at the distanced instigation of Louis of Bourbon, Prince of Condé, organized an amateurish plot (the conspiracy of Amboise, 1560) to seize {{the person of the}} Duke of Guise and his brother Charles, the Cardinal of Lorraine. The plot was discovered and violently suppressed, initiating a series of assassinations and counter-assassinations in an increasingly <b>toxic</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> In the immediate aftermath Condé was obliged to flee the court, {{and the power of the}} Guises was supreme. The discourse which Coligny, leader of the Huguenots, pronounced against les Guises in the Assembly of the notables at Fontainebleau (August, 1560), did not influence King Francis II in the least, but resulted rather in the imprisonment of Condé, at Charles's behest.|$|E

500|$|On 6 March 1862, {{the ship}} {{departed}} New York bound for Fort Monroe, Virginia, towed by the ocean-going tug Seth Low {{and accompanied by}} the gunboats [...] and [...] Worden, not trusting the seal between the turret and the hull, and ignoring Ericsson's advice, wedged the former in the up position and stuffed oakum and sail cloth in the gap. Rising seas that night washed the oakum away and water poured underneath the turret, {{as well as through}} the hawsepipe, various hatches, ventilation pipes, and the two funnels, so that the belts for the ventilation and boiler fans loosened and fell off and the fires in the boilers were nearly extinguished {{over the course of the}} next day; this created a <b>toxic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> in the engine room that knocked out most of the engine-room crew. First Assistant Engineer Isaac Newton ordered the engine room abandoned and had the able-bodied crew drag the afflicted engine room hands to the top of the turret where the fresh air could revive them. Both Newton and Stimers worked desperately to get the blowers to work, but they too succumbed to the noxious fumes and were taken above. One fireman was able to punch a hole in the fan box, drain the water, and restart the fan. Later that night, the wheel ropes controlling the ship's rudder jammed, making it near impossible to control the ship's heading in the rough seas. Monitor was now in danger of foundering, so Worden signaled Seth Low for help and had Monitor towed to calmer waters closer to shore so she was able to restart her engines later that evening. She rounded Cape Charles around 3:00pm on 8 March and entered Chesapeake Bay, reaching Hampton Roads at 9:00pm, well after the first day's fighting in the Battle of Hampton Roads had concluded.|$|E
2500|$|As deputy {{director}} {{and director of}} America's leading intelligence agency for many years, Gates and his CIA staff have been faulted for failing to accurately gauge the decline and disintegration of the Soviet Union. More particularly, Gates {{has been criticized for}} allegedly concocting evidence to show that the Soviet Union was stronger than it actually was. George Shultz said that, while Secretary of State, he felt the CIA under Gates was trying to [...] "manipulate" [...] him, that the agency was [...] "a big powerful machine not under good control. I distrust what comes out of it." [...] Schultz also told Gates at the time that his CIA was [...] "usually wrong" [...] about Moscow, having dismissed Gorbachev's policies as [...] "just another Soviet attempt to deceive us." [...] In 1991, Stansfield Turner, former Director of Central Intelligence, described the [...] "enormity of this failure to forecast the magnitude of the Soviet crisis. … I never heard a suggestion from the CIA … that numerous Soviets recognized a growing systemic economic problem." [...] Turner said this failure was a consequence of deliberate distortion by those in the upper echelon of the CIA who were helping to sell the Reagan administration's defense buildup, a view backed by former CIA analyst Melvin Goodman at Gates' 1991 confirmation hearings: [...] " [...] Casey seized on every opportunity to exaggerate the Soviet threat … [...] Gates' role in this activity was to corrupt the process and the ethics of intelligence." [...] Reviewing the third instalment of Gates' memoirs in 2016, Goodman said, [...] "In my 24 years at the CIA, there was never the kind of <b>toxic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> that existed when Gates served as {{deputy director}} for intelligence, deputy director of CIA, and finally director of CIA." [...] Also, according to Newsweek, Gates, as deputy director of CIA, allegedly vouched for the comprehensiveness of a CIA study presented to the Senate and President Reagan alleging that the Soviet Union {{played a role in the}} 1981 shooting of Pope John Paul II. A CIA internal review later denounced the report as being skewed, but that Gates did not try to influence the report's conclusions.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to varying}} degrees of success during the {{terraforming}} processes, each planet has a distinct environment type: Jupiter and Venus are temperate planets, the former of which has many drought-stricken areas; Earth is lush and filled with wildlife; Uranus is locked in a permanent winter of snowy environments; and Neptune, in total contrast to the others, is a dull, murky world, of mutant plant life (constituting the game's only organic in-game enemies), and <b>toxic</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> The environmental effects encountered in each level can vary wildly, changing as the player progresses through the level, and includes weather effects, such as rain; a day-night cycle; and lethal meteor showers. The planets' environments also contain a number of human- built sculptures and structures, including pyramids, moai, obelisks, and dolmen. Along with wildlife, early hominids also inhabit the planets, and appear to have been responsible for building the aforementioned structures.|$|R
40|$|The medical {{issues for}} an {{exploratory}} class mission to Mars are myriad and challenging.

They include hazards in the transit vehicle like foreign bodies and <b>toxic</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> and hazards in the habitat like decompression and combustion events. They also include human physiological adaptation to variable conditions of reduced gravity and prolonged isolation and confinement. The health maintenance program for a Mars mission will employ strategies of disease prevention, early detection, and contingency management, to mitigate the risks of spaceflight and exploration. Countermeasures for altered gravity conditions will allow crewmembers to maintain high levels of performance and nominal physiologic functioning.

40|$|For manned {{missions}} to Mars {{to become a}} reality, an efficient and reliable means of obtaining oxygen from the carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere will be required. Otherwise, {{the high cost of}} transporting the oxygen needed to sustain the astronauts will severely restrict the expedition to the martian surface. Recently, the use of electrochemical devices has been explored as a means of obtaining oxygen from the carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. In these devices, oxygen ions diffuse through solid oxide membranes, thus, separating oxygen from the other gases presented. This phenomenon has only recently been explored as a means of obtaining large quantities of oxygen from <b>toxic</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> although first observed by Walter nernst in 1899. Nernst observed that stabilized zirconia will conduct oxygen ions when an electrical potential is applied across metallic electrodes applied to the ceramic membrane. Diatomic oxygen molecules are dissociated at the positive electrode/electrolyte interface. The oxygen ions enter the ceramic body due to the ion density gradient which is produced by the electrical potential across the electrolytic membrane. Once the ions have diffused through the membrane, they reform diatomic oxygen molecules at the anode. The separation of oxygen from carbon dioxide is achieved by the combination of thermal and electrochemical processes. The thermal decomposition of carbon dioxide (at 1000 C) results in the production of carbon monoxide and oxygen by the reaction...|$|R

40|$|The {{equipment}} used for oil refining, dealing with highly explosive, inflammable and <b>toxic</b> <b>atmospheres</b> at surplus pressure and high temperatures, its operation term considerably exceeds normative one, is potentially dangerous and increases emergency situations, {{thus it is}} very important to define technical condition and the possibility of secure operation by scientifically proved methods at the end of normative operation term [7]. The modern definition of technical diagnostics as a field of scientific-technical knowledge, the essence of which is the theory, methods and means of faults detection and search of technical origin, includes the methods and means of undestroyable control. Nowadays a wide range of undestroyable control methods and items, among which important electromagnetic ones, are used to solve the diagnostic tasks of oil and gas equipment. A prosperous direction for solving the diagnostics tasks of oil and gas equipment is the usage of electro physical and mechanical properties interconnection in constructive steels. The mechanical and electro physical properties of metals interconnect with each other on the level of crystal lattice. The deformation of crystal structure, the fault origin and extension are followed by the alteration of mechanical and electro physical metal properties [4]. This way of interaction is necessary to use for the detection of actual metal condition in the operation process. If metal is a non-linear system, it is possible to apply well-known methods of condition control such as the analysis of transfer function by incoming effect and system reaction.

40|$|First {{response}} is critical when an incident {{on the farm}} causes severe injury. The first rule is to keep calm. Adrenalin can take over {{and a series of}} emotions such as panic, fear, and anxiety can be overwhelming when a severely injured person, possibly a family member, is discovered. Remaining calm and taking the appropriate actions can prevent putting you or the victim in further danger and provide emergency assistance that may save the life of the injured person. The appropriate action isn’t always apparent, and each emergency may require a different response. The first responder sometimes must make difficult choices; however, your primary concerns are to: 1. Make sure that you, or the victim, are not in further danger. 2. Get professional help by calling 911 and activating emergency medical services (EMS). 3. Provide appropriate care until EMS arrive. Whether you immediately go for help or begin rendering aid depends on three things: the type of incident, the severity of the injury, and your ability to correctly administer first aid and/or CPR. Activating EMS as soon as possible can increase the chances of survival by providing advanced medical care. If there are other people with you, one person should call 911 and one person should remain to assess the scene and assist the victim. 1. Scene assessment First, size up the situation from a position that does not put you at risk of injury. Before you rush in to assist the victim, first make sure the scene is safe. Do not become another victim. Look for live wires or electrical hazards, <b>toxic</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> chemical spills, potential fire hazards, unstable equipment, or aggressive livestock. Assess what might have caused the incident. Hazards could still be present at the incident scene.
