2500|$|I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> at a {{crossing}} in {{the roads}} of history, {{history in the}} grand sense. One road already appears clearly laid out, at least in its general orientation. That's the road {{of the loss of}} meaning, of the repetition of empty forms, of conformism, apathy, irresponsibility, and cynicism {{at the same time as}} it is that of the tightening grip of the capitalist imaginary of unlimited expansion of [...] "rational mastery," [...] pseudorational pseudomastery, of an unlimited expansion of consumption for the sake of consumption, that is to say, for nothing, and of a technoscience that has become autonomized along its path and that is evidently involved in the domination of this capitalist imaginary.|$|E

On arrival he told the media that Skybolt was an {{expensive}} and complex program that had suffered five test failures. [...] Kennedy told a television interviewer that [...] "we don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to get $2.5 billion worth of national security". US National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy gave an interview on television in which he stated that the US had no obligation to supply Skybolt to the UK. Thorneycroft had expected McNamara to offer of Polaris instead, but found him unwilling to countenance such an offer except as part of a Multinational Force. McNamara was willing to supply Hound Dog, or to allow the British to continue development of Skybolt.|$|E
2500|$|Obama has {{encouraged}} Democrats {{to reach out}} to evangelicals and other church-going people, saying, [...] "if we truly hope to speak to people where they’re at – to communicate our hopes and values in a way that’s relevant to their own – we cannot abandon the field of religious discourse." [...] He supports {{separation of church and state}} and contends that: [...] "I also <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> under obligation in public life to translate our religious values into moral terms that all people can share, including those who are not believers. And that is how our democracy’s functioning, will continue to function. That’s what the founding fathers intended." [...] In July 2008, Obama said that if elected president he would expand the delivery of social services through churches and other religious organizations, vowing to achieve what he said President Bush had fallen short on.|$|E

5000|$|On November 6, 1976, the 64-member {{board of}} {{directors}} of the NAACP elected Hooks executive director of the organization. In the late 1970s the membership had declined from a high of about 500,000 to only about 200,000. Hooks was determined to add to the enrollment and to raise money for the organization’s severely depleted treasury, without changing the NAACP’s goals or mandates. [...] "Black Americans are not defeated," [...] he told Ebony soon after his formal induction in 1977. [...] "The civil rights movement is not dead. If anyone <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to stop agitating, they had better think again. If anyone <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to stop litigating, they had better close the courts. If anyone <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not going to demonstrate and protest, they had better roll up the sidewalks." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 236, Sun Quan {{launched}} a campaign against Wei and he ordered Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin to lead an army to attack the Wei-controlled Xiangyang Commandery. Lu Xun sent a close aide, Han Bian (韓扁), to deliver a report to Sun Quan. On the journey back, Han Bian encountered the enemy at Mianzhong (沔中) and was captured. When Zhuge Jin received news of Han Bian's capture, he became fearful and wrote to Lu Xun: [...] "His Majesty has withdrawn his forces. The enemy has captured Han Bian and they know our situation. The rivers have dried up so we should make a hasty retreat." [...] Lu Xun did not respond, and he instructed his men to plant turnips and peas, while he played weiqi and other games with his officers as though nothing had happened. Zhuge Jin said, [...] "Boyan possesses intelligence and strategy, he knows what he's doing." [...] He came to see Lu Xun, who told him, [...] "The enemy knows that His Majesty has withdrawn his forces, so they have no worries and will concentrate their attacks on us. Besides, they have already stationed troops at critical positions and are poised to strike. Hence, we should remain composed and calm our men, after which {{we will have a}} change of plans and prepare to withdraw. If we display signs of retreat now, the enemy will <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> afraid and will definitely attack us, resulting in defeat for us." ...|$|E
60|$|SAVE. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{all agreed}} in this matter, and {{therefore}} there needs no more words about it.|$|E
60|$|SIR PETER. For I {{should never}} be able to stand Noll's jokes; so I'd have him <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> a very happy couple.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true, anyhow, uncle," [...] {{returned}} Alf; [...] "for if it <b>be,</b> as Chingatok <b>thinks,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{in search}} of nothing, of course when we find nothing, nothing will stop us!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Beatrice, {{do not be}} distressed," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{saw that}} you were asleep. It is a dreadful thing which has happened, but I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> seen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{likely to}} be back in Paris before next winter, master," [...] Paolo said rather discontentedly when Hector told him that they were to start early next morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know that}} I love you dearly, {{and it makes}} me so happy to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> friends. But tell me, dear Miss Churton--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose, uncle, you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{like the}} fox that lost his tail, or rather some unfortunate fox {{that might be}} born without one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take courage," [...] cried Lozelle, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> saved," [...] and he hoisted {{a second}} lantern at his masthead--why, {{they did not}} know.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would that}} you had laid hands upon him," [...] said the Prince angrily, {{continuing}} his conversation with Chandos, [...] "and yet, perchance, it was wiser to play this trick and make them <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> retreating." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was nothing}} of the ghost about Duncan!" [...] he remarked. [...] "I should {{consider}} him a remarkably substantial person. Don't you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> all a little overwrought last night? A strong likeness and a little imagination will often work wonders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The very question, my dear sister," [...] she said, [...] "tells me that I have succeeded. Dear me, what a {{difference}} it has made! No one would ever <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> sisters. Don't you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the shade of my hair is lovely?" ...|$|R
60|$|HON. And by {{this also}} I know that thou knowest what true pilgrimage is; for all others do <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> the soonest {{overcome}} of any.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, Bertha. We {{must not}} give them reason to say that their neighbors are inquisitive. But I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> safe if we stand like this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are turning}} my head," [...] he whispered. [...] "This {{is like a}} night out of Paradise. And to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> really {{in the middle of}} London!" ...|$|E
60|$|With my help he {{administered}} the chloroform, which was done under shelter of a sail for fear lest the people should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> smothering their chief. Then the operation {{went on to}} a satisfactory conclusion. I omit the details, but an electric battery and a red-hot wire came into play.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, mother." [...] Then, after a moment, she said, with a rush: [...] "Did {{you think}} I {{was going to}} let him suppose <b>we</b> <b>were</b> piqued at his not coming? Did you suppose I {{was going to let}} him patronize us, or <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in the least {{dependent}} on his favor or friendship?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, my dear Gertrude. She <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{a couple}} of fools who have mismanaged our own business, and that she, having managed so well for herself, can settle us in a jiffy. Come, did she not say to you, before I came, {{that it was time}} for me to be getting married?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}}, mademoiselle, I {{understand all}} you feel. It is most natural. You <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> lukewarm--that we lack fire and energy--but trust me, {{it is not}} so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> agreed, Major, {{that though}} we may hold this {{place for a}} time, sooner or later we must either {{surrender}} or the place be carried by storm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] I added, [...] "let {{the lamp}} of your wisdom shine upon our darkness. Do you not find this story wondrous, {{or do you}} perchance <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> liars?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Supper was over, {{and most}} of the people in the village were {{thinking}} of going to bed, when Abner said to Mary, [...] "Let us each take a spade, and I will carry a pail, and we will go out upon the beach for a walk. If any one should see us, they would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to dig for clams." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} is all right," [...] the Princess said composedly. [...] "One would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> a pack of children, to take any notice of such trifles. It is too early, my dear Cecil, by many a day, to look for trouble yet. Lord Ronald always wandered about pretty much as he chose. It will be months before--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{very great}} satisfaction," [...] he continued; [...] "and I cannot but <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{justified}} by the circumstances of our position in forgetting for a time the sad solemnity of the occasion. When I remember that it was but {{the day before yesterday}} that I followed my dear old aunt to the grave, I am astonished to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> yesterday I should have made an offer of marriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Glad to meet her, I am sure,' Mr. Murdoch said, with a humility {{altogether}} {{uncommon to}} him. 'I am {{very glad to}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to travel together, Miss Myrtle.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Middleton rejoined, [...] "and to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{likely to}} spend the winter in prison, at Quebec, instead of Old England. I am half {{inclined}} to try and escape!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Aunt Julia, {{our friends}} will <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> quarreling. I {{had no idea}} that you were unhappy. As soon as the Archangel reopens you must take rooms and enjoy {{yourself}} as usual." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall die {{just when}} I have to die, not before, Baas," [...] he replied in the {{intervals}} of reloading the little rifle. [...] "Also {{it was the}} trick of a wise man, not of a fool, seeing that it has made the Black Kendah <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> attacking them and caused them to hurry on to attack us in the dark over ground {{that they do not}} know. Listen to them coming!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{does your}} Royal Highness <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> Gentiles <b>are</b> cowards, {{although}} it is true those Fung are as good men as we any day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{take that}} for granted?" [...] she asked, equably. [...] "The pity {{of the whole}} thing is obvious enough, isn't it? Sometimes I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> a pair of fools. We played into the hands of fate. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> brought {{face to face with a}} terrible situation. Instead of meeting it bravely we played the coward. Why don't you forget, Lawrence, as I have done? Take up your work again. Set a seal upon--that memory." ...|$|R
