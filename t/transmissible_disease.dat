25|$|STD may refer only to {{infections that}} are causing diseases, {{or it may}} be used more loosely as a synonym for STI. Most of the time, people do not know that they are {{infected}} with an STI until they are tested or start showing symptoms of disease. Moreover, the term sexually <b>transmissible</b> <b>disease</b> is sometimes used since it is less restrictive in consideration of other factors or means of transmission. For instance, meningitis is transmissible by means of sexual contact but is not labeled an STI because sexual contact is not the primary vector for the pathogens that cause meningitis. This discrepancy is addressed by the probability of infection by means other than sexual contact. In general, an STI is an infection that has a negligible probability of transmission by means other than sexual contact, but has a realistic means of transmission by sexual contact (more sophisticated means—blood transfusion, sharing of hypodermic needles—are not taken into account). Thus, one may presume that, if a person is infected with an STI, e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital herpes, HPV it was transmitted to him/her by means of sexual contact.|$|E
60|$|But {{compulsory}} pairing is one thing, and {{the maintenance}} of general limiting conditions is another, and one well within the scope of State activity. The State is justified in saying, before you may add children to the community for the community to educate and in part to support, you must be above a certain minimum of personal efficiency, and this you must show by holding a position of solvency and independence in the world; you must be above a certain age, and a certain minimum of physical development, and free of any <b>transmissible</b> <b>disease.</b> You must not be a criminal unless you have expiated your offence. Failing these simple qualifications, if you and some person conspire and add to the population of the State, we will, for the sake of humanity, take over the innocent victim of your passions, but we shall insist that you are under a debt to the State of a peculiarly urgent sort, and one you will certainly pay, even if it is necessary to use restraint to get the payment out of you: it is a debt that has in the last resort your liberty as a security, and, moreover, if this thing happens a second time, or if it is disease or imbecility you have multiplied, we will take an absolutely effectual guarantee that neither you nor your partner offend again in this matter.|$|E

A total of 24. 2 % of patients had serologic profiles suggesting past hepatitis B virus infection. Anti–human immunodeficiency virus antibodies were not detected in any subject. Largely asymptomatic immigrant children show a high prevalence of communicable diseases.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} diploma {{work was}} the effort to map the {{problems}} and occurrence of sexually <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases,</b> particularly gonorrhea and syphilis, in Southern Bohemia in the time period 2000 [...] 2005.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze quality of {{investigation}} and treatment in the specialized services – dermatological and sexually <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> outpatient department of the II Kaunas Clinical hospital and private health care institution “Medidermas”. Methods. Study population – patients with dermatological and sexually <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases.</b> Randomly selected patients were interviewed in 2004 September-October. Totally 157 patients from state and 62 from private institution were investigated. MS Office Exel and EpiInfo 6. 0 packages were used in the statistical analysis. Results. Mean age of the investigated was 42. 5 ± 1. 1 yrs. One quarter of the investigated chose health care institution, recommended by familiar or friend, only 24 % applied to specialized departments with referrals. The majority of respondents (85. 5 %) of the private institution “Medidermas” were accepted after few days of registration, 38. 2 % (p< 0. 001) of the dermatological and sexually <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> outpatient department of the II Kaunas Clinical hospital were accepted after one or two weeks. 45. 2 % of the investigated in the private service were registered in the interval of 10 minutes, 43. 5 % - 15 minutes. In the state institution only 17. 8 % (p 0. 001) were registered during 10 minutes and half – 15 minutes. The respondents of “Medidermas” had a longer waiting time before acceptance to a medical doctor as compared to the state health care service (in 10 minutes 41. 9 % and 17. 3 %, p< 0. 001, respectively). 4 / 5 of the respondents of “Medidermas” had a visit to the doctor lasting 10 - 30 minutes, while 2 / 5 of patients of the state institution the visit to the doctor lasted only 10 - 15 minutes. 	The respondents in the private health care service institution were more satisfied with the interior order and keeping privacy as compared to the state health care institution. Female respondents of “Medidermas” were more satisfied with the competency of medical doctor, while male respondents were more satisfied in the state institution. Women with dermatological and sexually <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> in private institution preferred to accept positively the administered medication and their health status as compared to men and the respondents of the state health care institution. The majority of the respondents were satisfied with the facilities provided and the quality in health care, less satisfaction was documented among the patients in the dermatological and sexually <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> outpatient department of the II Kaunas Clinical hospital. Conclusions. The respondents of the private specialized institution “Medidermas” tended to be more satisfied with health care quality as compared to dermatological and sexually <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> outpatient department of the II Kaunas Clinical hospital...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Providing safe blood {{transfusion}} and blood derivates is of unique importance in contemporary medicine, {{taking into account}} that certain infections in the body are transmissible through the blood, its cell concentrates and plasma components. That is the reason why ascertainment of safe regulation for the way of taking the blood and its control is an important imperative and motive for preparation of this specialist’s work. Results: With all-embracing statistical analysis we succeeded to detect the most often infections which potentially can be transmitted to another body. The entire elaboration of the results of this work shows the percentage presence of HBsAg (1, 32 %), anti-HCV (0, 45 %), anti-HIV (0, 003 %) and Treponema pallidum (0, 10 %) at blood donor population of the determined transfusion <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> so far, vulnerable groups of blood donors (age, sex, predisposition to certain infections), the degree and efficiency of serological diagnostics applied in Regional Center for transfusion medicine in Shtip in the past 10 years and the way of prevention and additional education of people for spreading of transfusion <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases.</b> Conclusion: These results (previously noted) indicate the needs of continuous serological diagnosis and obligatory testing of every blood unit with ELISA tests with high sensitivity and specificity, as well as undertaking of appropriate preventive measures with which the consequences of higher number of transfusion <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> will be reduced...|$|R

50|$|It is not {{generally}} possible to prove what caused a particular cancer because the various causes {{do not have}} specific fingerprints. For example, if a person who uses tobacco heavily develops lung cancer, then it was probably caused by the tobacco use, but since everyone has a small chance of developing lung cancer {{as a result of}} air pollution or radiation, the cancer may have developed for one of those reasons.

5000|$|Although STDs are logical {{targets for}} {{examining}} {{the role of}} human behavior in a modeling framework, personal actions are important for other infectious diseases as well.

Even small reductions in the contact rate can be important, especially for diseases like influenza or [...] severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
