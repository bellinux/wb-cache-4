Simeon II has never signed any abdication papers—neither at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> he {{was nine years old}} and his legal {{capacity}} to sign such an instrument would be questionable in any event, nor at any time later. The royal family first went to Alexandria, Egypt, where Queen Giovanna's father Vittorio Emanuele III, King of Italy, lived in exile. There, Simeon II finished Victoria College (along with Crown Prince Leka of Albania). In July 1951, General Franco's dictatorship in Spain granted asylum to the family.|$|E

She is the first to be executed. Hassan khan appears and orders the execution to begin. There is no fear in the courageous heart of Nigar. She angrily blames the khan.

It is the men who ordered the executions who receive the punishment. The people greet Koroghlu with delight..|$|E

I thought about that idea, that the glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it's okay to go, you don’t have any more words to say, more business, more mountains to climb.

She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering.

500|$|After {{his loss}} to Kofi Kingston, The Miz turned {{face for the}} first time in his career when he joined Mick Foley's team at Survivor Series after confronting Paul Heyman on the November 18 Raw. At Survivor Series, The Miz {{eliminated}} Wade Barrett before being eliminated by Alberto Del Rio. In the months to come, Miz's turn was not well received by critics, who commented that Miz as a babyface was too similar to his heel character because he was [...] "still cocky, arrogant, and egotistical" [...] while [...] "pivoted toward calling out established heels". Other criticisms were that Miz was [...] "juvenile", lacking of depth, [...] "grating and not endearing to the audience" [...] and that [...] "there was not <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> he officially turned and aligned his values with the audience's". The Miz then began a feud with United States Champion Antonio Cesaro, after Cesaro insulted America. During this feud Ric Flair became Miz's mentor, and he subsequently adopted the figure-four leglock from Flair as a new finisher. The Miz challenged for Cesaro's United States Championship at the Royal Rumble pre-show, at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, and on the March 3 episode of SmackDown, but was unsuccessful each time.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{commenced}} composing [...] "White Horse" [...] {{almost a}} year before the release of Fearless, weeks after composing Fearless lead single [...] "Love Story", songs which are quite disparate lyrically. Swift first solely wrote the first verse. She then made a phone call to Liz Rose, co-writer of most tracks on Swift's eponymous debut studio album, Taylor Swift (2006), asking for her aid in finishing the song; the two completed writing the song in approximately forty-five minutes. The song was inspired by a boyfriend of Swift's who she perceived to be a Prince Charming and, in the downfall of the relationship, then realized he was not. She said he was the person who triggered the song, but, once in the midst of writing it, drifted in direction. It focused on the initial moment where she recognized the relationship was over. She said everything after that particular moment centered on recuperation and, because of that, considered it the most solemn aspect of a breakup: [...] "To me, 'White Horse' is about what, in my opinion, is the most heart-breaking part of a break-up – <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> you realize that all the dreams you had, all those visions you had of being with this person, all that disappears." [...] About the difference in themes between [...] "White Horse" [...] and [...] "Love Story", Swift explained that in divergent scenarios, she regarded fairytales in different manners. She attributed the fact that because she did not expect to go through the event, then she became more inclined to come in terms with reality.|$|E

500|$|Mercedes and Riley reunite {{but when}} she discovers Riley does not love her she kidnaps Bobby in revenge and blames it on a Mitzeee, who has {{recently}} escaped from prison. Metcalfe said Mercedes does not have [...] "any regrets whatsoever. I think she does what she does at {{the time for a}} reason and she'll deal with the consequences later". Mercedes is arrested when Myra reports her to the police. Riley is shortly after shot dead. Mercedes is put on trial for two counts of perverting the course of justice, one for the kidnap and one for stabbing herself. Digital Spy's Kilkelly reported that Mercedes lawyer Jim McGinn (Dan Tetsell) would advise Mercedes to blame Riley for the crimes as he can not defend himself. Mercedes reluctantly agrees and tells the courtroom that Riley stabbed her and was abusive towards her. Metcalfe felt the scenes were [...] "great to film", adding that [...] "the writers came up with some brilliant material". However, she felt the scenes were [...] "challenging" [...] to film as Mercedes [...] "completely breaks down and says how bad Riley was. From the audience's point of view, it's really going to be quite shocking". The actress added that Mercedes [...] "does feel guilty about it, but only as guilty as Mercedes can ever feel. So she gets over it very quickly!" [...] During the trial Jim suggests that Riley killed Lynsey and that Doctor Browning is innocent. Doctor Browning appears at the trial to give evidence, which Metcalfe revealed is [...] "a total surprise. I don't think she knows how she'll react until she actually sees him, and when she does they're back in <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> he was dragged away from her. She really did fall for him hook, line and sinker".|$|E
500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E
500|$|When an {{interviewer}} {{asked him to}} describe himself as a child, he replied that he was [...] "probably well-meaning and naive like all kids." [...] His passion for sea life {{can be traced to}} his childhood, when several films by French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau made a strong impression on him. He has said that Cousteau [...] "provided a view into that world", which he did not know existed. He liked to explore tide pools as a child, bringing home objects that [...] "should have been left there and that ended up dying and smelling really bad." [...] Also at a young age, Hillenburg developed his interest in art. His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration that he drew in third grade depicting [...] "a bunch of army men... kissing and hugging instead of fighting" [...] marked the first praise that he received for his work after his teacher commended it. [...] "Of course, this is 1970... She liked it because, I mean, obviously that {{was in the middle of}} [...] She was, I would imagine, not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. ...I had no idea about the implications, really, because I just thought it was a funny idea. I remember that still, <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> she said, 'oh my gosh, look at that,'" [...] Hillenburg elaborated. It was then when he knew that he [...] "had some [...] skill". Hillenburg asserted that his artistry comes from his mother's side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was [...] "really, really gifted" [...] and a [...] "great painter". In the 1970s, someone took him to the International Tournée of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Hillenburg was [...] "knocked out" [...] by the foreign animated films that were screened at the festival, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen's The Killing of an Egg (1977). [...] "That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on," [...] he recounted.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly before FlatSpin was premiered, it was {{announced}} that a third Damsels in Distress play would be performed later in the season. As a result, there were few stand-alone reviews of FlatSpin, with many reviewers choosing to wait for RolePlay to review the plays together. This did not stop Jeremy Kingston of The Times giving a broadly positive review of the play, in spite of some reservations about some logical flaws, in particular singling out commendation for Alison Pargeter for her performance as Rosie. Charles Hutchinson of the Yorkshire Evening Press also gave praise for her performance, noting that until now her career had consisted mostly of child and teenage roles (GamePlan included), and writing [...] "... it is like <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> the librarian takes off her glasses".|$|E
2500|$|Martin Luther, who {{initiated}} the Protestant Reformation, said: [...] "Mother Mary, like us, {{was born in}} sin of sinful parents, but the Holy Spirit covered her, sanctified and purified her so that this child was born of flesh and blood, but not with sinful flesh and blood. The Holy Spirit permitted the Virgin Mary to remain a true, natural human being of flesh and blood, just as we. However, he warded off sin from her flesh and blood so that she became {{the mother of a}} pure child, not poisoned by sin as we are. For in <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> she conceived, she was a holy mother filled with the Holy Spirit and her fruit is a holy pure fruit, at once God and truly man, in one person." [...] Some Lutherans, such as the members of the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church, support the doctrine.|$|E

Paul Prayag of Record Mirror praised the album, awarding it {{a score of}} 4 out of 5 and writing: [...] "Siouxsie and Budgie are wandering {{deeper and deeper into}} a jungle that looks like having no easily definable boundaries". Melody Maker described Feast as [...] "an album of filtered brilliance, fertile, sensual and erotic; an album that, in its desperate naivety, attempts to articulate <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> the monsoon ends, when the smell and the heat conspire in a perfumed mist and life sprouts instantly, green and luxurious". NME also hailed it: [...] "The Creatures have assembled a multifarious sonic boom that is as various and kaleidoscopic as can be imagined. The humours of Sioux's frosty larynx are nakedly outlined against skins of sometimes fabulous quality. The drum sound on 'Ice House' must be one of the greatest on record".|$|E
