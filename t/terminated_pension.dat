50|$|Belt {{became the}} {{executive}} direction of PBGC in April 2004. The PBGC {{was set up}} by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, to guarantee defined benefit pension plan benefits for plan sponsors that become insolvent when there are too few pension plan assets to fully pay all insured pension benefits. As {{the chief executive officer of}} PBGC, Belt oversaw the U.S. government corporation that insures the pension benefits of private sector workers and retirees. He also played a leading role in the historic overhaul of U.S. pension rules, giving millions of Americans a better chance of getting the retirement benefits they earned. The bill also created added incentives for greater worker participation in 401(K)s. During Belt's tenure as director, the PBGC took on extensive liabilities from <b>terminated</b> <b>pension</b> plans, including United Air Lines, and became massively underfunded. On March 23, 2006 he announced his intention to resign effective May 2006.|$|E

Using data from both pension plan filings with the PBGC and IRS as well as firm financial data, we find firms wishing to change their defined benefit plans are motivated in part by potential wealth transfer and tax implications. We find that firms <b>terminating</b> <b>pension</b> plans tend to have lower potential wealth transfers and lower taxes. Firms choosing to convert to a cash balance plan tend to have higher potential wealth transfer, indicating they wish to modify the implicit contract instead of terminating the plan. We find no evidence to support that financial constrained firms choose to terminate rather than convert their plans...|$|R

40|$|If {{the intent}} of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, was to assure that {{beneficiaries}} of insolvent pension plans receive adequate pension benefits, sharp increases in nominal rates of interest have blunted that purpose. Without an increase in these rates, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, PBGC, the insurance agency established to guarantee benefits, faced large liabilities on the terminations of pension plans. We examine the economics of pension funds and the funding of pension funds before and after the enactment of ERISA. The Act changed the economics of pension funds. The PBGC, the employer, and the employees have interests in the assets of the pension plan. The PBGC can tax corporations to pay off liabilities and to fund guaranteed benefits; employers can <b>terminate</b> <b>pension</b> plans or overfund them; employees can ask for more benefits or claim the assets in the fund. Although the PBGC insures benefits, the insurance agent forbears, not acting quickly to protect its own interests. To prevent potential huge increases in its liabilities, the PBGC could require that employers hedge the guaranteed benefits, and fund their increases in promised benefits. Given its policies, these requirements could protect the PBGC. ...|$|R

Second, plan participants and beneficiaries may lose pension benefits due to limits on PBGC guarantees.

Following bankruptcy in 2005, Delphi's six qualified defined benefit (DB) plans were terminated and trusteed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) in July 2009. These terminations culminated from a complex series of events involving Delphi, GM, various unions, the U. S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury), as well as PBGC. Congress asked us to examine a range of issues related to PBGC's termination of Delphi's DB plans, such as the decision to terminate, the efforts to secure plan assets, the treatment of collective bargaining agreements, and Treasury's role throughout the process. As discussed with Congressional staff members in December 2010, this report includes a timeline of key events leading to the termination of Delphi's plans. The timeline focuses, in particular, on events related to the reasons for GM providing retirement benefit supplements to certain Delphi employees, but not to others, and Treasury's role in those events.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since 2001, the U. S. airline industry has confronted unprecedented financial losses. Two of the nation's largest airlines [...] United Airlines and US Airways [...] went into bankruptcy, <b>terminating</b> their <b>pension</b> plans and passing the unfunded liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). PBGC's unfunded liability was $ 9. 6 billion; plan participants lost $ 5. 2 billion in benefits. Considerable debate has ensued over airlines' use of bankruptcy protection {{as a means to}} continue operations, often for years. Many in the industry and elsewhere have maintained that airlines' use of this approach is harmful to the industry, in that it allows inefficient carriers to reduce ticket prices below those of their competitors. This debate has received even sharper focus with pension defaults. Critics argue that by not having to meet their pension obligations, airlines in bankruptcy have an advantage that may encourage other companies to take the same approach. GAO is completing a report for the Committee due later this year. Today's testimony presents preliminary observations in three areas: (1) the continued financial difficulties faced by legacy airlines, (2) the effect of bankruptcy on the industry and competitors, and (3) the effect of airline pension underfunding on employees, airlines, and the PBGC. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} stock returns around legislative events concerning the passage of, and subsequent increase in, the excise tax on overfunded pension plan reversions. Tests are {{conducted to determine}} (1) whether those events are associated with downward revaluations of firms sponsoring defined benefit plans (DB firms) relative to firms not sponsoring defined benefit plans (NDB) firms and (2) whether the event period returns for DB firms {{were related to the}} funding levels of their pension plans. These tests provide evidence {{about whether or not the}} option to revert excess pension assets has value. Implicit contract interpretations of reversions specify that the firm enters into implicit contracts with employees that promise part or all of excess pension assets to employees, and that capital market participants recognize and expect firms to honor those implicit contracts. Additionally, if reversions represent wealth transfers from workers, potentially resultant adverse labor cost effects may mean that reversions are not equity value increasing events, especially if managements do not invest the reverted assets in positive net present value projects. This implicit contract interpretation of reversions, then, potentially implies that the option to revert is not valued by shareholders. If the option to revert is not valued, the passage/increase of a reversion excise tax would not be expected to affect firm value. ^ However, firms legally have the option to <b>terminate</b> overfunded <b>pension</b> plans and revert excess pension assets. These reversions may represent liquidations of valuable financial slack in the Myers and Majluf (1984) sense. If the option to revert excess pension assets has value, then the passage/increase in the reversion excise tax would be expected to affect the prices of firms sponsoring defined benefit plans. The results are, in general, weakly consistent with the hypothesis that legislative events concerning the passage and subsequent increase in the reversion excise tax affected the values of DB firms in a manner congruous with shareholders valuing the option to revert excess pension assets. ...|$|R
