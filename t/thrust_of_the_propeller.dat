50|$|When an {{aircraft}} is in {{straight and level flight}} at cruise speed, the propeller disc is {{perpendicular to the}} relative wind. Each of the propeller blades will contact the air at the same angle and speed and thus the thrust produced is evenly centered across the propeller. As the aircraft's angle of attack increases and the propeller disc rotates toward the horizontal, the airflow will meet the propeller disc at an increasing angle. The propeller blades moving down and forward (for clockwise rotation, from the one o'clock to the six o'clock position when viewed from the front) will have a greater relative wind velocity and therefore will produce greater thrust, while propeller blades moving up and back (from the seven o'clock through 12 o'clock position) will have a decreased relative wind velocity and therefore decreased thrust. This asymmetry displaces the center of <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> disc towards the blade with increased thrust. In {{an aircraft}} with two or more propeller engines, P-Factor is what determines which engine is the critical engine.|$|E

50|$|Jet engines, {{particularly}} turbojets, are {{a type of}} {{gas turbine}} configured such that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work available results from <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hot exhaust gases.

50|$|In {{turboprop}} engines, {{a portion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine's <b>thrust</b> {{is produced by}} spinning a propeller, rather than relying solely on high-speed jet exhaust. As their jet thrust is augmented by a propeller, turboprops are occasionally {{referred to as a}} type of hybrid jet engine. They are quite similar to turbofans in many respects, except that they use a traditional <b>propeller</b> to provide <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>thrust,</b> rather than a ducted fan. Both fans and <b>propellers</b> are powered <b>the</b> same way, although most turboprops use gear-reduction between the turbine and <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> (geared turbofans also feature gear reduction). While many turboprops generate <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> their <b>thrust</b> with <b>the</b> <b>propeller,</b> <b>the</b> hot-jet exhaust is an important design point, and maximum thrust is obtained by matching <b>thrust</b> contributions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> to <b>the</b> hot jet.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} on {{the wake of a}} propelled bluff body towed at a constant horizontal speed in a linearly stratified fluid. Three regimes of the wake have been found, depending on the angle of attack and on the ratio of drag force to propeller thrust. Most of the experiments were obtained in a first regime where a strong momentum flux is created in the wake, which can be oriented backward or frontward depending on the ratio of drag force to <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller.</b> The velocity amplitude, wake width and Strouhal number of the wake can be predicted by defining a momentum thickness based on the drag coefficient of the bluff body and the <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller.</b> A second regime is obtained on a narrow band of towing velocities, with a relative width of 4 %, in which the momentum flux is found to vanish. The wake is characterised by the velocity fluctuations; the scaling exponents of the velocity, vorticity and width of the wake are measured. A third regime is obtained for wakes with a small angle of attack, with a null momentum flux. The mean profile of the wake is found to be asymmetric and its amplitude and wake width are measured. Finally, the relevance of these results to the case of a real self-propelled bluff body is discussed. The presence of weak internal waves or of weak fluctuations of background velocity would lead to a wake in the regime with momentum flux, and would allow prediction of the amplitude, width and Strouhal number of the wake...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{interaction}} between a propeller and its self-induced vortices originating {{on the ground}} is investigated in a scaled experiment. The velocity distribution in the flow field in two different planes containing the self-induced vortices is measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV). These planes are a wall–parallel plane in close proximity to the ground and a wall–normal plane just upstream of the propeller. Based on the visualization of the flow field in these two planes, the occurrence of ground vortices and its domain boundary are analysed. The elevation of the propeller from the ground and the <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> are two parameters that determine the occurrence of ground vortices. The main features of the propeller inflow {{in the presence of the}} ground vortices are highlighted. Moreover, the analysis of the non-uniform inflow in the azimuthal direction shows that with increasing the propeller thrust coefficient and decreasing the elevation of the propeller above the ground, the variation of the inflow angle of the blade increases.

40|$|Abstract: During {{the ground}} {{operation}} of aircraft, {{the interaction between}} the propulsor-induced flow field and the ground may lead to the generation of ground vortices. Utilizing numerical approaches, the source of vorticity entering ground vortices is investigated. The results show that the production of wall-parallel components of vorticity has a strong contribution from the wall-parallel components of the pressure gradient on the wall, which is generated by the action of the propulsor. This mechanism is a supplementation for the vorticity transported from the far-field boundary layer, which has been assumed the main vorticity source in a number of previous publications. Furthermore, the quantitative prediction of the occurrence of ground vortices is performed from the numerical results. As the distance of the propeller form the ground decreases, and as the <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> increases, ground vortices are generated from the ground and enter the propeller. In addition, the vortices which exist near the ground but does not enter the propeller plane are observed and visualized by three-dimensional data.

In order to evaluate the propulsive performance of the podded drive system, a Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) solver is employed. The method has been first verified by a single propeller with different hub taper angles. The performance curves of the propellers, obtained by numerical methods, have been compared to and validated with experimental results. In the next step, the method has been extended to the podded drive unit for both puller and pusher configurations. The yaw angles of the podded drives are set to vary from - 300 to + 300 with 50 increments. The propulsive characteristics, including the torque and <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller,</b> the axial force, and the side force of the unit are presented as functions of the advance velocity ratio and yaw angle.

40|$|Podded {{propulsion}} systems offer greater maneuvering possibilities for marine vehicles than conventional shaft and rudder systems. As the propulsion unit rotates about its vertical axis to a specified azimuth angle, the entire <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> {{contributes to the}} steering moment without relying on lift generation by a control surface such as a rudder. However, the larger sideforce and moment cause the ship to enter the nonlinear realm sooner than a ruddered vessel. Furthermore if the rudder or azimuthing propulsor is aft of the vessel's center of gravity then the system is non-minimum phase; during a turn the ship center initially moves in the direction opposite the turn. For these reasons {{it is necessary to}} design a robust maneuvering control system to set the azimuth angle of the propulsor in an intelligent and stable manner. This thesis focuses on the path following performance of a vessel with podded propulsion. The enhanced maneuvering abilities of such vessels allow the time constant of cross-track error response to be greatly reduced. Additionally these vessels can follow course changes and waypoints more precisely than ruddered vessels. (cont.) A simple path following algorithm was developed to achieve this performance; the algorithm uses simulation-based feedforward terms to anticipate the sliding motion of the vessel during a turn. The stability and performance analysis was performed in three domains: linear theory, a nonlinear simulation, and experiments with a 12 -foot autonomous surface vessel. Experiments confirmed that path following performance was vastly improved using the feedforward algorithm for waypoints at which the course change angle was large. by Matthew B. Greytak. Thesis (S.

Methods: UAV NAU PKF "Aurora" is developed for experimental flights in manual, semi-automatic and unmanned modes. The uniqueness and scientific novelty of data of flight testes is in a complete separation and isolation of vertical and horizontal components of the flight, which enables a fundamentally new way of moving of vehicle in the aerial space. This approach gives a ability to obtain all advantages and to eliminate disadvantages of helicopter and airplane in fundamentally new aircraft by structure and by function – namely in the policopter flyer with additional independent engines of the lateral thrust. Results: Obtained a new experimental data that allowed {{to better understand the}} nature of the physical forces, providing the flight of the policopter. Discussion: Revised a physical basis of the airscrew (propeller), namely on the example of flight of the policopter proved that most of the <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> provided by the mechanical impulse (kinetic energy Е к =mv 2 / 2) by the impulse, that a airscrew receives at his collisions with air molecules,but not by the gradient of air pressure below and above the airscrew.

40|$|A {{waterjet}} propulsor {{operates in}} a different way than a conventional propeller. This makes it hard to use the same concepts for studying the thrust and powering of these systems. The net <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> can be obtained by measuring the force transmitted through its shaft, but since there is not just a single contact point between the waterjet unit and the hull, the net thrust measurement cannot be easily accomplished for the waterjet unit. Instead another thrust force, which is simpler to measure, is defined to express the magnitude of the waterjet unit thrust. The new thrust definition is called the gross thrust and is obtained by the measurement of the momentum flux change through the waterjet control volume. In this thesis, it has been tried to find out the links between these two thrust forces. The original work fulfilled in this thesis can be divided in to two main parts. The first part is an introduction to an iterative algorithm for modelling the effect of the waterjet on the hull. The algorithm is called the Pressure Jump Method. This method is {{based on the fact that}} the resistance forces are balanced with the thrust force created by the head increase through the waterjet pump. In this thesis, the Pressure Jump Method is coupled with a potential flow solver capable of non-linear free-surface modelling but there is not any limitation for the method to be used in combination with, e. g., RANS solvers. Validation and verification of the Pressure Jump Method is accomplished by comparing the computational results with experimental data available from a test case. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to investigate the individual contribution of different parameters that may influence the thrust deduction of a waterjet-propelled craft. In this part the results obtained from the Pressure Jump Method along with some extra calculations are employed to find out the dominant parameters, which contribute to the thrust deduction...|$|E

In the present work, Fluent 6. 3 software is also used to solve advanced phenomena like cavitation <b>of</b> <b>propeller.</b> <b>The</b> simulation results <b>of</b> cavitation and open water characteristics of propeller are compared with experimental predictions, as obtained from literature [1]...|$|R
40|$|In <b>the</b> {{interest}} <b>of</b> promoting <b>the</b> integration <b>of</b> hybrid-electric {{power train}} into the aviation industry, research is {{being conducted by}} North Carolina State University to establish <b>the</b> feasibility <b>of</b> electrified power train in a small scale unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). To accomplish this, {{it is first necessary}} to understand dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system to calculate the required power associated with each portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft’s mission. Though research that has been conducted in the past based power required on published governing equations. However, in <b>the</b> interest <b>of</b> understand <b>the</b> system at its most fundamental level, it was deemed prudent to derive the governing equations from Newton’s second law. Using analytical dynamics, a rotating coordinate system was applied to the craft and a rotation matrix was applied to establish <b>the</b> interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft’s external forces based on its Euler angles with respect to the inertial frame. The equations associated with the values and interactions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft’s external forces were combined and manipulated to develop three governing parameters of maintaining flight during a typical UAV mission. These parameters are minimum airspeed, minimum power applied to <b>the</b> <b>propeller,</b> and <b>the</b> minimum roll angle required to accomplish a loitering maneuver with set radius about a target. <b>The</b> next step <b>of</b> this research will be development of an optimization algorithm to match power train components to apply the necessary conditions derived in this paper.

The maximum lift and stalling characteristics of several model configurations, the longitudinal stability characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model, and <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control surfaces were determined with <b>the</b> <b>propellers</b> removed. <b>The</b> propulsive characteristics, <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>propeller</b> operation on <b>the</b> lift, and <b>the</b> static <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model <b>propellers</b> were determined at several propeller-blade angles. The results with <b>the</b> <b>propellers</b> removed showed that the maximum lift coefficient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complete model configuration was only 0. 97 was compared with <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> 1. 31 for the model configuration in which the engine-air ducts and canopy are removed. The model with <b>the</b> <b>propellers</b> removed (normal center-of-gravity position) has a positive static margin, stick fixed, varying from 5 to 13 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean aerodynamic chord throughout <b>the</b> unstalled range <b>of</b> lift coefficients. <b>The</b> unit horizontal tail is sufficiently powerful to trim the airplane with <b>the</b> <b>propellers</b> removed throughout <b>the</b> unstalled range <b>of</b> lift coefficients. <b>The</b> peak propulsive efficiencies for beta = 20 degrees and beta = 30 degrees were increased 7 percent at C(sub L) congruent to 0. 67 and 20 percent at C(sub L) congruent to 0. 74, respectively, with <b>the</b> <b>propellers</b> rotating upward in the center than with <b>the</b> <b>propellers</b> rotating downward in the center. Indications are that the minimum forward-flight speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airplane for full-power operation at sea level will be about 90 miles per hour.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a comprehensive experimental study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variations <b>of</b> propulsive characteristics of puller and pusher podded propulsors in static azimuthing open water conditions. A custom designed six-component global dynamometer and a three-component pod dynamometer {{were used to}} measure <b>the</b> propulsive performance <b>of</b> a podded unit in pusher and puller configurations in a towing tank. The unit was tested to measure the forces on the whole unit in the three co-ordinate directions as well as <b>thrust</b> and torque <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> {{for a range of}} advance coefficients combined with <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> static azimuthing angles from + 30 ° to – 30 ° with 5 ° and 10 ° increments.

40|$|<b>The</b> results <b>of</b> {{tests on}} a rudder {{operating}} downstream of a <b>propeller</b> are presented. <b>The</b> tests {{were carried out}} in an open laboratory. The tests were therefore carried out at true zero speed. This corresponds to an advance ratio of J= 0 or bollard pull condition. Performance comparisons were made for seven rudder angles between - 45 degrees and + 45 degrees at two rates of revolution 1160 and 1460 rpm. <b>The</b> tests consisted <b>of</b> a series of parametric studies into <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> longitudinal and lateral distance between <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> and rudder. A five-component strain-gauge dynamometer {{was used to measure}} lift, drag and three moments on the rudder. A rotating strain gauge dynamometer measured the developed <b>thrust</b> and torque <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller.</b> Results are presented in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> non-dimensional coefficients lift (C subscript L), drag (C subscript D). <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> rudder on propeller performance is given in terms <b>of</b> non-dimensional <b>thrust</b> (K subscript T) coefficient and torque (K subscript Q) coefficient.

The model propulsor was instrumented to measure <b>thrust</b> and torque <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller,</b> three orthogonal forces and moments on the unit, rotational speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller,</b> azimuthing angle and azimuthing rate. The model was first tested over {{a range of}} advance coefficients at various static azimuthing angles in <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> 0 ° to 360 °. These tests were followed by tests in which the azimuthing angle was varied dynamically at different azimuthing rates and <b>propeller</b> rotational speeds. <b>The</b> performance coefficients <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> and <b>the</b> pod unit showed a strong dependence on <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> loading and azimuthing angle. The open water characteristics were mostly irregular for the astern thrust conditions in the azimuthing angle beyond the range 90 ° to 270 °, where the flow separation at <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> blades and <b>the</b> pod-strut body might have occurred. The coefficients in static azimuthing conditions fit well with a 10 th order polynomial fit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data obtained in the dynamic azimuthing condition in the corresponding azimuthing angles and advance coefficients. An uncertainty analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measurements is also presented. Keywords Podded propulsor; static and dynamic azimuthing; propulsive performance; global forces and moments. ...|$|R
