40|$|Ocean {{acidification}} (OA) {{could potentially}} alter {{the interaction between}} settling invertebrate larvae and the settlement cue-producing crustose coralline algae (CCA). We hypothesized this arises from the impairment of larval cue detection and/or physiological changes to CCA. We examined {{the interaction between the}} larvae of the commercially valuable red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and its preferred settlement substrata, CCA species Lithothamnium californicum, under high pCO₂ conditions created to mimic future OA scenarios. CCA were exposed <b>to</b> <b>high</b> pCO₂ conditions (treatment pH 0. 2 ± 0. 05 units lower than ambient) for 6 weeks and larvae were exposed during early development. Physiological studies were first conducted <b>to</b> determine whether <b>high</b> pCO₂ directly impacts CCA growth and larval survival. Three unique orthogonal larval settlement experiments were performed to determine if larval substrate preference was affected by : 1) larval exposure <b>to</b> <b>high</b> pCO₂, 2) CCA exposure <b>to</b> <b>high</b> pCO₂, or 3) both organisms' exposure <b>to</b> <b>high</b> pCO₂. My results show that 1) CCA suffered a reduction in net calcification, 2) four out of five trials did not reveal an impact of high pCO₂ on abalone larval survival, 3) CCA exposure <b>to</b> <b>high</b> pCO₂ did not affect larval settlement to CCA, 4) larval exposure <b>to</b> <b>high</b> pCO₂ reduced settlement to CCA and 5) both organisms exposure <b>to</b> <b>high</b> pCO₂ did not affect settlement. Larval survival and settlement responses were variable after larval exposure <b>to</b> <b>high</b> pCO₂. This may have been a result of the conditions adult abalone were raised, adult fitness and possibly genetic adaptation to O...|$|R

5|$|A 1993 study {{proposed}} that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was {{not the result of}} hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. Compared to modern wolves, the high frequency of tooth fracture in Beringian wolves indicates higher carcass consumption due <b>to</b> <b>higher</b> carnivore density and increased competition.|$|E
5|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{influential}} factor shaping this new class was the competitive nature of scholarly candidates entering civil service through the imperial examinations. Although not all scholar-officials came from the landholding class, sons of prominent landholders had better access <b>to</b> <b>higher</b> education, and thus greater ability to pass examinations for government service. Gaining a scholarly degree by passing prefectural, circuit-level, or palace exams in the Song period {{was the most important}} prerequisite in being considered for appointment, especially <b>to</b> <b>higher</b> posts; this was a departure from the Tang period, when the examination system was enacted on a much smaller scale. A higher degree attained through the three levels of examinations meant a greater chance of obtaining higher offices in government. Not only did this ensure a higher salary, but also greater social prestige, visibly distinguished by dress. This institutionalized distinction of scholar-officials by dress included the type and even color of traditional silken robes, hats, and girdles, demarcating that scholar-official's level of administrative authority. This rigid code of dress was especially enforced during the beginning of the dynasty, although the prestigious clothing color of purple slowly began to diffuse through the ranks of middle and low grade officials.|$|E
