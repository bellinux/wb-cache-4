Although black is still used for submarines, it was discontinued on destroyers after it had been determined that black ships remained more noticeable than gray ships on even <b>the</b> <b>darkest</b> nights.|$|E
5|$|Hancock {{served in}} Congress {{through some of}} <b>the</b> <b>darkest</b> days of the Revolutionary War.

5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} to financial success, but initial reviews were mixed, which criticized its violence, later {{contributing to the}} creation of the PG-13 rating. However, critical opinion has improved since 1984, citing the film's intensity and imagination. Some of the film's cast and crew, including Spielberg, retrospectively view the film in a negative light, partly due to the film being <b>the</b> <b>darkest</b> and most overtly violent Indiana Jones film. The film has also been the subject of controversy due to its portrayal of India and Hinduism.|$|E

5|$|Umbriel is a moon of Uranus {{discovered}} on October 24, 1851, by William Lassell. It was discovered {{at the same}} time as Ariel and named after a character in Alexander Pope's poem The Rape of the Lock. Umbriel consists mainly of ice with a substantial fraction of rock, and may be differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. The surface is <b>the</b> <b>darkest</b> among Uranian moons, and appears to have been shaped primarily by impacts. However, the presence of canyons suggests early endogenic processes, and the moon may have undergone an early endogenically driven resurfacing event that obliterated its older surface.|$|E
5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming process {{as some of}} <b>the</b> <b>darkest</b> days of his career, explaining that the baby was a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving the baby was shot, the crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide the baby through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax the baby into co-operation. One scene required the baby to suckle Chan's nipple. The baby was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed {{a large amount of}} honey onto the nipple.|$|E

5|$|Pale Blue Dot, {{which was}} {{taken with the}} narrow-angle camera, was also {{published}} {{as part of a}} composite picture created from a wide-angle camera photograph showing the Sun and the region of space containing the Earth and Venus. The wide-angle image was inset with two narrow-angle pictures: Pale Blue Dot and a similar photograph of Venus. The wide-angle photograph was taken with <b>the</b> <b>darkest</b> filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 milliseconds), to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. Even so, the result was a bright burned-out image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera and the Sun that appears far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The rays around the Sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide-angle lens.|$|E
