40|$|Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) {{returned}} {{one high}} pressure fuel hose to Engine Systems, Inc. (ESI) because CNS had found foreign material within the hose during receipt inspection. This fuel hose {{was one of four}} fuel hoses that had been supplied to CNS by ESI in October 2011. ESI performed an evaluation and found very small pieces of the elastomer tube internal to the hose. Apparently these pieces were introduced during assembly of the end fittings onto the hose during fabrication of <b>the</b> <b>hose</b> <b>assembly.</b> When installed, this fuel hose would be located after the engine fuel filter and before the fuel injection pumps. Foreign material within this hose could migrate to the fuel injection pumps. The entrance of foreign material could impact operability of one or more fuel injection pumps and therefore affect fuel delivery to one or more engine cylinders. This could impact the load carrying capability of the diesel engine or possibly cause complete engine shutdown. Either scenario has the potential to prevent the emergency diesel generator from performing its safety related function. These hoses were supplied only to CNS. 02 - 03 - 12; 03 : 43 PM; # 11 /...|$|E

40|$|A {{computational}} method is {{developed for the}} estimation of parameters in a distributed model for a flexible structure. The structure we consider (part of the RPL experiment) consists of a cantilevered beam with a thruster and linear accelerometer at the free end. The thruster is fed by a pressurized hose whose horizontal motion effects the transverse vibration of the beam. The Euler-Bernoulli theory is used to model the vibration of the beam and treat <b>the</b> <b>hose</b> thruster <b>assembly</b> as a lumped or point mass dashpot spring system at the tip. Measurements of linear acceleration at the tip are used to estimate <b>the</b> <b>hose</b> parameters (mass, stiffness, damping) and a Voigt-Kelvin viscoelastic structural damping parameter for the beam using a least squares fit to the data. Spline based approximations are considered to the hybrid (coupled ordinary and partial differential equations) systems; theoretical convergence results and numerical studies with both simulation and actual experimental data obtained from the structure are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of robotics in a new field for applying surface treatments in building voids {{and the development of}} the architecture of the robotic vehicle for use in this application. The nature of the application means that the robotic vehicle must be capable of accessing voids through small openings and this has led to a deployable architecture for the vehicle which can be fed through an opening and then reconfigures its form to enable practical operation. A typical application for the robot is to apply thermal insulation to the underside of wooden or concrete floors in buildings. The terrain is varied ranging from sand to impacted dusty hard core, can be strewn with builders’ debris such as bricks and timber, and is interspersed with retainer walls that support the floor above. Within this environment the robot {{needs to be able to}} navigate and deploy a spray applied insulation fed by a <b>hose</b> <b>assembly.</b> This paper describes the robot architecture and its development with particular focus on deployable features enabling access to confined spaces, the traction system used to negotiate diverse surfaces while pulling <b>the</b> umbilical <b>hose</b> <b>assembly,</b> <b>the</b> sensor array and how it is used to control the spray patterns. The resulting robots have been commercially developed, and are successfully spraying thermal insulation in a wide range of building applications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} {{framework}} and preliminary experimental results for technical gestures recognition using a RGB-D camera. We have studied a collaborative task between a robot and an operator: {{the assembly of}} a motor <b>hoses.</b> <b>The</b> goal is to enable the robot to understand which task has just been executed by a human operator in order to anticipate on his actions, to adapt his speed and react properly if an unusual event occurs. The depth camera is placed above the operator, to minimize the possible occlusion on an assembly line, and we track the head and {{the hands of the}} operator using the geodesic distance between the head and the pixels of his torso. To describe his movements we used the shape of the shortest routes joining the head and the hands.

50|$|Washdown is {{the process}} of using a stream of water to clean a flat or nearly flat outside surface. Typically the area cleaned is a large expanse of {{concrete}} or asphalt.
