60|$|The maid bowed again, and {{disappeared}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> leaving an awe-struck group behind her.|$|E
60|$|The descent {{came to an}} end, however, as {{must all}} things in this world, and he groped his way <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> door, {{not so much as}} daring to breathe.|$|E
60|$|I {{confess that}} I {{was not very}} anxious to look him up, but I {{followed}} the boarder, as he slowly made his way <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> door. As we opened the door we instinctively stopped.|$|E
50|$|Founded in 2008, Synchronicity {{resides in}} a nine-bedroom Craftsman home built in 1910. A portion of {{community}} members' rent goes <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> purchase of <b>kitchen</b> and gardening supplies, and members {{have access to}} a shared music room and production studio. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> features bar-grade beer taps serving cheaper beer at $1 per pint and a more expensive beer for $2.

60|$|With {{cautious}} steps Leo left <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{and walked}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> stairs {{leading to the}} next floor.|$|R
6000|$|She found Bella {{running through}} <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> entry where Mary Bell was, calling out with great {{appearance}} of delight, ...|$|R
60|$|As Miriam {{went around}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> Ralph sprang to the ground, and Dora {{approached}} him. Miss Panney {{could see her}} face under the sunbonnet. It was suffused with {{the light of a}} smiling, beaming welcome.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, yew've chopped enough fer two meals, son," [...] {{replied the}} farmer, and turning <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> door, he called: [...] "Here, Maw, fix this boy up with suthin' t'eat--enough fer {{a couple of}} meals fer two on 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{pleasant}} to see thee resting, mother, and every {{thing going on}} so well," [...] he said, glancing about the room, where the old lady sat, and nodding <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> where Christie was toasting bread in her neatest manner.|$|E
60|$|Steven {{slipped into}} the house through the {{emergency}} door. He {{made his way to}} <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> with great care, walking on tip-toe. He punched <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> controls at random, his heart beating excitedly. The stove began to whirr, purring into life. Meter readings came on, crossing <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> completion marks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wish you'd step in there," [...] the Squire said, nodding <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> room {{opposite}} <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> [...] "and {{bring me}} out the Laws of Ohio. You know where it is." ...|$|R
60|$|The boys came {{cautiously}} out of {{the barn}} and looked <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> house. Every curtain was tightly drawn, and lights shown only from <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and <b>the</b> dining room of the old dwelling.|$|R
60|$|The {{first evening}} after the {{marriage}} night Saxon met Billy {{at the door}} as he came up the front steps. After their embrace, and as they crossed the parlor hand in hand <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> he filled his lungs through his nostrils with audible satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|... "And off {{he went to}} the barn, leavin' me shakin' {{with his}} jolt. He was game all right! He figured me out as the prodigal son, and wa'n't goin' to knuckle. He {{intended}} for me to do all the knee exercise. I drifted along up the path <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b>|$|E
60|$|The women sat apart, in {{the comer}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> and {{there seemed to}} be a strange fascination for them in the talk and action of the men. The wife of Jacobs was a little woman, with homely face and very bright eyes. Jean thought she would be a help in that {{household}} during the next doubtful hours.|$|E
5|$|Natural light--large {{apartment}} buildings were oriented to provide sunlight to the residents, ideally orienting <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> east {{to get the}} morning light and {{the living room to}} the west for evening light.|$|R
6000|$|Anne turned pale, {{but there}} was clearly {{only one thing to}} be done. She walked <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> house, where a ladder was leaning against <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> roof. All <b>the</b> fifth-class girls said, [...] "Oh!" [...] partly in excitement, partly in dismay.|$|R
50|$|Kōjin, {{also known}} as Sambō-Kōjin or Sanbō-Kōjin (三宝荒神), is the Japanese kami (god) of fire, the hearth, and <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> He is {{sometimes}} called Kamado-gami, literally {{the god of the}} stove. He represents violent forces that are turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> good of humankind.|$|R
6000|$|In an hour Stuffy {{leaned back}} with a battle won. [...] "Thankee kindly, sir," [...] he puffed like a leaky steam pipe; [...] "thankee kindly for a hearty meal." [...] Then he arose heavily with glazed eyes and started <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> A waiter turned him about like a top, and pointed him toward the door. The Old Gentleman {{carefully}} counted out $1.30 in silver change, leaving three nickels for the waiter.|$|E
60|$|When, {{a morning}} {{or so after}} {{witnessing}} one of these beautiful scenes, our own landlady knocks at our door and creates a disturbance over a paltry matter {{of three or four}} weeks' rent, and says she'll have her money or out we go that very day, and drifts slowly away down <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> abusing us in a rising voice as she descends, then we think of these things and grow sad.|$|E
6000|$|Father {{swung his}} shapeless pack from his shoulders, {{set it down}} on the ground, reluctantly drew his mouth-organ from its case. He became aware that a large, {{astonished}} woman was staring from the kitchen window. He stared back. The mouth-organ was left suspended in air. Hastily he stuck it in his pocket and, as though hypnotized, moved <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> door. He had to give the woman some explanation for encamping in her yard.... Why! She might have thought that he had intended to make a fool of himself by playing the mouth-organ there! ...|$|E
60|$|The animal {{moved off}} at last and shambled <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> house, looking bigger and {{considerably}} more clumsy than the largest bulldog Frank had ever seen. He walked into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> docilely, but when Miss Oliver approached him Harry {{cried out in}} dismay.|$|R
6000|$|The two men {{first moved}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> grove of <b>the</b> <b>Kitchen,</b> much to Hive's discontent. The dog several times halted, and he whined, and growled, and {{otherwise}} manifested his great dislike to proceed in that direction. At length so decided did his resistance become, that his master {{said to his}} companion: ...|$|R
60|$|Mother {{was sitting}} by <b>the</b> wide <b>kitchen</b> table, which was scarred with generations {{of use of}} cleaver and bread-knife and steak-pounder. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> door was open to the broad land, which flowed up to the sill in a {{pleasant}} sea of waving grass. But she was turned from it, staring apprehensively <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> tea-room. Round her swirled {{the heat from the}} stove, and restless flies lighted on her cheek and flew off at hectic tangents.|$|R
60|$|As {{there was}} not much to choose, I did ride on, and soon ceased to hear the hoofs of the negro's horse at my heels. I reached the inn an hour ere Jaap appeared, and was {{actually}} seated at a capital supper before he rode up, as one belonging only to himself. Jaap had taken off the Littlepage emblems, and had altogether a most independent air. His horse was stabled alongside of mine, and I soon found that he himself was at work on the remnants of my supper, as they retreated <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us look on {{the bright}} side. We are in no hurry. Blandings Castle is quite as {{comfortable}} as Number Seven Arundell Street, and the commissariat department is a revelation to me. I had no idea English servants did themselves so well. And, as for the social side, I love it; I revel in it. For {{the first time in my}} life I feel as though I am somebody. Did you observe my manner <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> maid who waited on us at dinner last night? A touch of the old noblesse about it, I fancy. Dignified but not unkind, I think. And I can keep it up. So far as I am concerned, let this life continue indefinitely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My fren'," [...] said Etienne, exhaling a large cloud {{from his}} {{cigarette}} and patting Ross lightly on the shoulder with a bediamonded hand which, hung limp from a yard or more of bony arm, [...] "I see I mus' be frank with you. Firs', because we are rivals; second, because you take these matters so serious. I--I am Frenchman. I love the women"--he threw back his curls, bared his yellow teeth, and blew an unsavory kiss <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> [...] "It is, I suppose, a trait of my nation. All Frenchmen love the women--pretty women. Now, look: Here I am!" [...] He spread out his arms. [...] "Cold outside! I detes' the col-l-l! Snow! I abominate the mees-ser-rhable snow! Two men! This--" [...] pointing to me--"an' this!" [...] Pointing to' Ross. [...] "I am distracted! For two whole days I stan' at the window an' tear my 'air! I am nervous, upset, pr-r-ro-foun'ly distress inside my 'ead! An' suddenly--be'old! A woman, a nice, pretty, charming, innocen' young woman! I, naturally, rejoice. I become myself again--gay, light-'earted, 'appy. I address myself to mademoiselle; it passes the time. That, m'sieu', is wot the women are for--pass the time! Entertainment--like the music, like the wine! ...|$|E
50|$|The {{house is}} a wood frame, two and {{one-half}} story Queene Anne house. Its irregular plan has bays projecting <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> southwest and northeast sides. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> is a one-story ell on the northwest side. The residence has ship-lap siding. The steep, gabled roof has composition shingles over the original metal roof.|$|R
50|$|The first brick {{buildings}} that Samuel Fagot built, {{and that would}} remain {{a part of the}} final design of the complex, were matching temple-like structures that housed the plantation office and <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>The</b> one-story, stuccoed {{brick buildings}} were each fronted by a tetrastyle portico with Tuscan columns. They flanked the north and south sides of <b>the</b> main house <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> rear (east) and measured 6.8 m wide by 16.83 m deep.|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later Doctor Hentley arrived, and drove {{the men from the}} rooms. They waited till he had finished, to assure {{themselves}} of Billy's well being, and then departed. In <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> Doctor Hentley washed his hands and gave Saxon final instructions. As he dried himself he sniffed the air and looked <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> stove where a pot was simmering.|$|R
60|$|Willie Case {{had been}} taken to Payson {{to testify before the}} coroner's jury {{investigating}} the death of Giova's father, and with the dollar which The Oskaloosa Kid had given him in the morning burning in his pocket had proceeded to indulge in an orgy of dissipation the moment that he had been freed from the inquest. Ice cream, red pop, peanuts, candy, and soda water may have diminished his appetite but not his pride and self-satisfaction as he sat alone and by night {{for the first time in}} a public eating place. Willie was now a man of the world, a bon vivant, as he ordered ham and eggs from the pretty waitress of The Elite Restaurant on Broadway; but at heart he was not happy for never before had he realized what a great proportion of his anatomy was made up of hands and feet. As he glanced fearfully at the former, silhouetted against the white of the table cloth, he flushed scarlet, assured as he was that the waitress who had just turned away <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> with his order was convulsed with laughter and that every other eye in the establishment was glued upon him. To assume an air of nonchalance and thereby impress and disarm his critics Willie reached for a toothpick in the little glass holder near the center of the table and upset the sugar bowl. Immediately Willie snatched back the offending hand and glared ferociously at the ceiling. He could feel the roots of his hair being consumed in the heat of his skin. A quick side glance that required all his will power to consummate showed him that no one appeared to have noticed his faux pas and Willie was again slowly returning to normal when the proprietor of the restaurant came up from behind and asked him to remove his hat.|$|E
5000|$|Forbes noted how [...] "Metrecal {{moved out}} of the {{medicine}} cabinet <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> the patio, the pool", while an article in a November 1960 article in Time magazine reported that it was being purchased by [...] "growing hordes of Schmoo-shaped addicts who were insisting on guzzling their way to the vanishing point" [...] who were joined by the royalty of Greece and Saudi Arabia. In her 1963 book The Feminine Mystique, Betty Friedan lamented how women [...] "ate a chalk called Metrecal, instead of food, to shrink to the size of thin young models." ...|$|E
50|$|After a while, Marc Anthony {{takes the}} kitten {{into the kitchen}} and {{attempts}} to scold it, but when he hears his owner walking <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> he hastily hides the kitten in a flour canister and tries to look innocent. Growing tired of his antics, his owner evicts him from the kitchen and tells him to stay out while she bakes cookies. Marc Anthony watches as his owner scoops out a cup of flour, and is horrified to see that the kitten is in the measuring cup. The lady pours the flour, along with the kitten, into a mixing bowl and prepares to use an electric mixer. The bulldog tries several times to thwart her, finally spraying his face with whipped cream to make himself appear rabid, resulting in his disbelieving and exasperated owner throwing him out of the house. Meanwhile, the kitten climbs out of the bowl and hides behind a box of soap flakes to clean itself up.|$|E
60|$|When {{he saw the}} two fish {{lying there}} his eyes nearly started out of his head. He jabbered {{something}} in his native tongue and then looked around wildly, first {{to one side of}} <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and then <b>the</b> other. Then he looked <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door leading to the dining room and then he came to the door leading to the yard.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{be more of}} a feller than I thought for," [...] he said, {{and strode}} off through <b>the</b> drizzle <b>toward</b> Coniston. <b>The</b> painter walked slowly to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> where Chester Perkins and his wife were sitting down to supper.|$|R
60|$|With {{her head}} on one side, and her smile and her bow, La Fleur left <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> by <b>the</b> outer door. She stepped quickly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> barn, looking right and left as she walked. She wished very much to see Mike, and {{presently}} she had that pleasure. He had {{just come out of}} the barnyard, and was closing the gate. She hurried toward him, for, although somewhat porpoise-built, she was vigorous and could walk fast.|$|R
