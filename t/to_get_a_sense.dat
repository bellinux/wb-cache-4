As Beth's condition worsen, Lori asks Daryl (Norman Reedus) to drive into town to check on Rick, but Daryl refuses, saying his days of searching for someone are over. Lori opts to go alone, but en route, her car hits a walker and is overturned.|$|E
25|$|Rowe and Koetter were not, however, championing collage in the {{pictorial}} sense, much less seeking {{the types of}} disruptions of meaning that occur with collage. Instead, they were looking to challenge the uniformity of Modernism and saw collage with its non-linear notion of history {{as a means to}} reinvigorate design practice. Not only does historical urban fabric have its place, but in studying it, designers were, so it was hoped, able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of how better to operate. Rowe {{was a member of the}} so-called Texas Rangers, a group of architects who taught at the University of Texas for a while. Another member of that group was Bernhard Hoesli, a Swiss architect who went on to become an important educator at the ETH-Zurirch. Whereas for Rowe, collage was more a metaphor than an actual practice, Hoesli actively made collages as part of his design process. He was close to Robert Slutzky, a New York-based artist, and frequently introduced the question of collage and disruption in his studio work.|$|E
25|$|The {{data for}} an {{earthquake}} is plotted using a lower-hemisphere stereographic projection. The azimuth and take-off angle {{are used to}} plot the position of an individual seismic record. The take-off angle is the angle from the vertical of a seismic ray as it emerges from the earthquake focus. These angles are calculated from a standard set of tables that describe {{the relationship between the}} take-off angle and the distance between the focus and the observing station. By convention, filled symbols are used to plot data from stations where the P-wave first motion recorded was up (a compressive wave), hollow symbols for down (a tensional wave), with dots for stations with arrivals too weak <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of motion. If there are sufficient observations, one may draw two well-constrained orthogonal great circles that divide the compressive from the tensional observations and these are the nodal planes. Observations from stations with no clear first motion normally lie close to these planes. By convention the compressional quadrants are colour-filled and the tensional left white. The two nodal planes intersect at the N (neutral)-axis. The P and T axes are also often plotted; with the N axis these three directions respectively match the directions of the maximum, minimum and intermediate principal compressive stresses associated with the earthquake. The P-axis is plotted in the centre of the white segment, the T-axis in the centre of the colour-filled segment.|$|E

Marvin V. Rush later explained that they were not aiming for a real world forest look to the scenes, as the story allowed them to aim for something in the [...] "in mythology and in historical record" [...] instead.

To achieve this, Wintory had {{to play the game}} extensively and repeatedly <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> for what players would experience and what would best match the mood.

To help her, Stead met with Wendy Lamb, an editor Stead had met in a workshop a few years before. Lamb suggested that Stead meet with a [...] "critique group" [...] who would help read and revise the drafts Stead wrote. After Stead created a revised copy of the novel in 2005, she sent it to Lamb again and a contract was drawn up. More revisions were made {{in order to make}} the new world created in the novel easier to understand. Stead found it hard [...] "to maintain a sense of 'the whole'.

Beginning with Batman #251's [...] "The Joker's Five-Way Revenge", the character {{returns to his}} roots as an impulsive, homicidal maniac who matches wits with Batman. This story began a trend in which the Joker was used, sparingly, as a central character. O'Neil said his idea was [...] "simply {{to take it back}} to where it started. I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories. I tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of what Kane and Finger were after." [...] O'Neil's 1973 run introduced the idea of the Joker being legally insane, to explain why the character is sent to Arkham Asylum (introduced by O'Neil in 1974 as Arkham Hospital) instead of to prison. Adams modified the Joker's appearance, changing his more average figure by extending his jaw and making him taller and leaner.|$|E

The developers felt that this control scheme forced them to make the gameplay fluid and easy to grasp, though they also added the option to control the game with a keyboard or Xbox 360 controller. Yu and Holowka considered the [...] "hallmark" [...] of exploratory games to be a sense of loneliness, which they made a part of the narrative, but also wanted the player <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of Naija's character. To that end, they used voice-overs to demonstrate to the player what Naija was feeling during key points of the game. The voice of Naija was performed by Jenna Sharpe, who was chosen after auditioning several other voice actresses. She additionally sang the vocals for one song on the soundtrack, [...] "Lost to the Waves". She also sang a nine-minute vocal piece, [...] "Fear the Dark", especially for the release of the Aquaria soundtrack album, which was published by Bit Blot on November 14, 2009.

500|$|When {{determining}} {{the style of}} 3D shooting they wanted to use, Burg felt that the audience would want several moments where objects move into the audience, comparing this to My Bloody Valentine 3D. He acknowledged that this method would be used, but {{expressed an interest in}} shooting from the victim's perspective, similar to that of first-person shooter video games being rendered in 3D. Dunstan added that [...] "It adds a whole new layer of discipline and criteria to creating these moments. We've had a very flat surface {{to try to get a}} reaction out of you. Now, we get to push out a bit and envelop the viewer, still maintaining the patterns that have worked and been successful, but also to raise it up a notch." [...] Commenting on the change to filming in 3D, Bell stated it would not affect his performance or methods of acting, noting that it would be an [...] "interesting experience". Mandylor called the 3D shoot [...] "more tedious and longer". Flannery described the 3D aspect as being [...] " [...] shot in 3D so that you can, perse, see blood coming directly at you.

500|$|In 2017, Nolan {{directed}} and produced Dunkirk, {{based on his}} own original screenplay. The story is set amid World War II and the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, France in 1940. During the year-long production of his first film, Following (1998), Nolan and Thomas hired a small sailing boat to take them across the English Channel and retrace the journey of the little ships of Dunkirk. [...] "We did {{it at the same}} time of year <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of what it was like, and it turned out to be an incredibly dangerous experience. And that was with no bombs dropping on us." [...] For Dunkirk, Nolan said he was inspired by the work of Robert Bresson, silent films such as Intolerance (1916) and [...] (1927) as well as by The Wages of Fear (1953). Describing the film as a survival tale with a triptych structure, he wanted to make a [...] "sensory, almost experimental movie" [...] with minimal dialogue. Nolan said he waited to make Dunkirk until he had earned the trust of a major studio to let him make it as a British film, but with an American budget. Before filming, Nolan also sought advice from Spielberg, who later said in an interview with Variety, [...] "Knowing and respecting that Chris [...] is one of the world's most imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his imagination, as I did on Ryan, in second position to the research he was doing to authentically acquit this historical drama." [...] Starring Fionn Whitehead, Jack Lowden, Aneurin Barnard, Harry Styles, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy and Kenneth Branagh, Dunkirk was released in theaters on 21 July 2017 to widespread critical acclaim and strong box office results, grossing over $520 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing World War II film of all time. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote in his review: [...] "It's one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers. There are movies—they are rare—that lift you out of your present circumstances and immerse you so fully in another experience that you watch in a state of jaw-dropped awe. Dunkirk is that kind of movie." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times lauded the film, calling it [...] "a tour de force of cinematic craft and technique, but one that is unambiguously in the service of a sober, sincere, profoundly moral story that closes the distance between yesterday's fights and today's." ...|$|E
