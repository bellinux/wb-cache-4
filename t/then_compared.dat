5|$|Myers {{worked at}} Mohawk Valley Bank for six years. During {{this time he}} {{developed}} an interest in counterfeit money. He collected counterfeit bills and assembled a scrapbook of these for study. He then had another book of genuine bills; he <b>then</b> <b>compared</b> the two to learn the counterfeiters' techniques. He became an expert in detecting counterfeit bills. This became a valued interest to the bankers and Myers was given all the bank notes to pass through him for approval of genuineness. This ultimately became {{a basis for the}} present day method of detecting counterfeit bills.|$|E
5|$|This {{problem is}} not {{exclusive}} to electric vehicles. In 2007 research at the Technical University Munich showed that ordinary vehicles in background noise are often detected too late for safe accident avoidance. The researchers measured the distances of 35 approaching vehicles to a pedestrian in the moment when they just got audible in a stationary background noise. These distances were <b>then</b> <b>compared</b> to the stopping distances of the respective cars and an algorithm was proposed to estimate them based on auditory masking.|$|E
5|$|Although San Francisco {{had sought}} Tuolumne River water {{as early as}} the 1890s, this project did not move forward until the {{disastrous}} earthquake and fire of 1906, which underscored the insufficiency of the existing water supply. The Hetch Hetchy Valley – <b>then</b> <b>compared</b> to Yosemite Valley for its scenic beauty – was chosen for its water quality and hydroelectric potential, but the location within the national park generated controversy. An act of Congress was required to circumvent federal protection of the Tuolumne River, with the reasoning that public land should be developed for the public benefit.|$|E

5|$|As {{many of the}} {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms of}} ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on {{the clinical}} presentation of the patient. In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by freezing point depression and <b>then</b> <b>compared</b> with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E
5|$|Hygrometer: Prototype {{hygrometers}} were devised {{and developed}} in the hills during the Western Han dynasty in Ancient China to elucidate mechanisms of long-range meteorological fluctuations. The Chinese used a bar of charcoal and a lump of earth: its dry weight was taken and <b>then</b> <b>compared</b> with its damp weight after being exposed in the air. The differences in weight was used to tally the humidity level. Other techniques were applied using mass to measure humidity such as when the air was dry, the bar of charcoal would be light while the air was humid, the bar of charcoal would be heavy. By hanging a lump of earth and a bar of charcoal on the two ends of a staff separately and adding a fixated lifting string on the middle point to make the staff horizontal in dry air, an ancient hygrometer was made.|$|E
5|$|Using {{a similar}} strategy, S. D. Malone and S. Bor {{analyzed}} the known intensities for the 1872 shock, <b>then</b> <b>compared</b> intensity patterns {{for a number}} of instrumentally recorded earthquakes that also occurred in the Pacific Northwest. A factor that was taken into consideration was that for earthquakes that have either circular or slightly elliptical isoseismal maps, the epicenter is usually close {{to the center of the}} pattern, but that for shocks where instrumental information are also available, the epicenter is sometimes not where it would have been assumed to be, had only the intensity information (and no instrumental information) been available. An isoseismal map of the 1949 Olympia earthquake was presented as an example of a distorted or convoluted pattern that was attributed to local geological conditions that either attenuated or amplified the seismic waves, and it was emphasized that not taking into account these local features could lead to a misinterpretation of the felt intensities and to a misplaced epicenter.|$|E
