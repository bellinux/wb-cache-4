The only way that we are aware of you can do that is to have tight configuration management and tight central control. So that is where a lot of the complaints came from.

60|$|The {{argument}} used is {{of course}} plain enough. It is said that women are left destitute in the world--destitute unless they can be self- dependent, and that to women {{should be given the}} same open access to wages that men possess, in order that they may be as self- dependent as men. Why should a young woman, for whom no father is able to provide, not enjoy those means of provision which are open to a young man so circumstanced? But I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> very simple. The young man, under the happiest circumstances which may befall him, is bound to earn his bread. The young woman is only so bound when happy circumstances do not befall her. Should we endeavor to make the recurrence of unhappy circumstances more general or less so? What does any tradesman, any professional man, any mechanic wish for his children? Is it not this, that his sons shall go forth and earn their bread, and that his daughters shall remain with him till they are married? Is not that the mother's wish? Is it not notorious that such is the wish of us all as to our daughters? In advocating the rights of women it is of other men's girls that we think, never of our own.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Greenwood again expresses {{his views}} about this dark {{suspicious}} mystery, {{the absence of}} Shakespeare or Shakspere (or Shak, as you like it), from Henslowe's accounts, if Shak(&c.) wrote plays. But the mystery, if mystery there be, is just as obscure if the actor were the channel through which Bacon's plays reached the stage, for the pretended author of these masterpieces. Shak--was not the man {{to do all the}} troking, bargaining, lying, going here and there, and making himself a motley to the view for 0 pounds, 0s, 0d. If he were a sham, a figure-head, a liar, a fetcher-and-carrier of manuscripts, HE WOULD BE PAID FOR IT. But he did not deal with Henslowe in his bargainings, and THAT is why Henslowe does not mention him. Mr. Greenwood, in one place, {161a} agrees, so far, with me. [...] "Why did Henslowe not mention Shakespeare as the writer of other plays" [...] (than Titus Andronicus and Henry VI)? [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> simple enough." [...] (So do I.) [...] "Neither Shakspere nor 'Shakespeare' ever wrote for Henslowe!"

We only differ as to WHY the author was above Henslowe's [...] "sky-line." [...] I say, because good Will had a better market, that of his Company. I understand Mr. Greenwood to think,--because the Great Unknown was too great a man to deal with Henslowe. If to write for the stage were discreditable, to deal (unknown) with Henslowe was no more disgraceful than to deal with [...] "a cry of players"; and as (unknown) Will did the bargaining, the Great Unknown was as safe with Will in one case as in the other. If Will did not receive anything for the plays from his own company (who firmly believed in his authorship), they must have said, [...] "Will! dost thou serve the Muses and thy obliged fellows for naught?

60|$|As natural {{selection}} acts {{only by the}} accumulation of slight modifications of structure or instinct, each profitable to the individual under its conditions of life, it may reasonably be asked, how a long and graduated succession of modified architectural instincts, all tending towards the present perfect plan of construction, could have profited the progenitors of the hive-bee? I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> not difficult: {{it is known that}} bees are often hard pressed to get sufficient nectar; and I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier that it has been experimentally found that no less than from twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar are consumed by a hive of bees for the secretion of each pound of wax; so that a prodigious quantity of fluid nectar must be collected and consumed by the bees in a hive for the secretion of the wax necessary for the construction of their combs. Moreover, many bees have to remain idle for many days during the process of secretion. A large store of honey is indispensable to support a large stock of bees during the winter; and the security of the hive is known mainly to depend on a large number of bees being supported. Hence the saving of wax by largely saving honey must be a most important element of success in any family of bees. Of course the success of any species of bee may be dependent on the number of its parasites or other enemies, or on quite distinct causes, and so be altogether independent of the quantity of honey which the bees could collect. But let us suppose that this latter circumstance determined, as it probably often does determine, the numbers of a humble-bee which could exist in a country; and let us further suppose that the community lived throughout the winter, and consequently required a store of honey: there can in this case be no doubt that it would be an advantage to our humble-bee, if a slight modification of her instinct led her to make her waxen cells near together, so as to intersect a little; for a wall in common even to two adjoining cells, would save some little wax. Hence it would continually be more and more advantageous to our humble-bee, if she were to make her cells more and more regular, nearer together, and aggregated into a mass, like the cells of the Melipona; for in this case {{a large part of the}} bounding surface of each cell would serve to bound other cells, and much wax would be saved. Again, from the same cause, it would be advantageous to the Melipona, if she were to make her cells closer together, and more regular in every way than at present; for then, as we have seen, the spherical surfaces would wholly disappear, and would all be replaced by plane surfaces; and the Melipona would make a comb as perfect as that of the hive-bee. Beyond this stage of perfection in architecture, {{natural selection}} could not lead; for the comb of the hive-bee, as far as we can see, is absolutely perfect in economising wax.|$|E

I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> not difficult: cells constructed {{like those of the}} bee or the wasp gain in strength, and save much in labour and space, and in the materials of which they are constructed. With respect to the formation of wax, it is known that bees are often hard pressed to get sufficient nectar; and I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier that it has been experimentally proved that from twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar are consumed by a hive of bees for the secretion of a pound of wax; so that a prodigious quantity of fluid nectar must be collected and consumed by the bees in a hive for the secretion of the wax necessary for the construction of their combs.

Those who find these and other reasons compelling will find Sims’s paper very provocative.

40|$|Kant’s philosophy, it {{is often}} thought, leads to an untenable picture of the self. He argues that we cannot have {{knowledge}} {{of the type of}} entity we are, but seems to contradict that conclusion by claiming we are free and morally responsible. Commentators accuse him of blindly prioritizing his ethical views, not recognizing that his metaphysical views prohibit the very picture of the self his moral theory necessitates. Sympathetic interpreters of Kant’s view of the self focus on either his theoretical or ethical view, despite Kant’s insistence that the two are interdependent. I argue that Kant offers us a deeply consistent, unified, and plausible view of the self. For Kant, an individual necessarily thinks and acts as though he or she—and any other human being—is a substantial, complete entity with an identity that remains the same over time. As this work shows, the significance of the self, for Kant, is practical, not theoretical. A theory aims to gain knowledge of the self and examine what type of object it is and how it is constituted. Perhaps we are spiritual, immaterial souls, or alternatively, entities ultimately reducible to the brain or body. I establish that Kant thinks that such views are doomed to be either tautological or contradictory. This <b>is</b> because they <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> wrong question. The right question is not how the self is constituted, but what we are committed to. Kant <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> clear: we must hold ourselves and others responsible, and we must believe that we are free and that our actions and choices matter. My interpretation reveals that Kant’s true aim is to demonstrate how we can make good on these commitments without fear of being contradicted by theory. Theorizing about the self, according to Kant, is idle. But recognizing so makes room for one to act in accordance with one’s commitments, both moral and explanatory. Furthermore, I prove that Kant thinks we must act under the idea of the self not just to hold ourselves and others responsible but to view the world as the causally unified place we do...|$|R

This question is not new, at least among relativists who <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> certainly no, not only {{in view of the}} nonlinearity of the theories mentioned [26]. The problem was and still is the notion of averaging whose specification and unambiguous definition {{turned out to be an}} endeavor of high magnitude, mainly because it is not straightforward to give a unique meaning t...|$|R
