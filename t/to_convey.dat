5|$|In {{his book}} Popular Contemporary Writers, Michael D. Sharp {{describes}} Vonnegut's linguistic style as straightforward; his sentences concise, his language simple, his paragraphs brief, and his ordinary tone conversational. Vonnegut uses this style <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> normally complex subject matter {{in a way}} that is intelligible to a large audience. He credited his time as a journalist for his ability, pointing to his work with the Chicago City News Bureau, which required him <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> stories in telephone conversations. Vonnegut's compositions are also laced with distinct references to his own life, notably in Slaughterhouse-Five and Slapstick.|$|E

5|$|A complex {{predicate}} is {{the combination}} {{of more than one}} element, more than one individual word, <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> the information involved in a single event. For instance, the event swim is conveyed in Wagiman using a combination of a verb ya- 'go' and a coverb liri-ma 'swimming'. There is no verb in Wagiman that, on its own, conveys the event of swimming.|$|E
5|$|On 19 October Banksy {{released}} another {{video for}} his tour of New York potentially <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> {{the movement in}} nature that we are blind to but it is truly just a vagina with ants crawling out of it.|$|E
5|$|The booklet's back-cover picture {{showed an}} open guitar case filled {{with food and}} medical supplies, below {{a copy of the}} cheque for the Madison Square Garden box-office takings. Wilkes {{intended}} this image <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> a sense of hope, signifying the completion of the task that the participants had set out to achieve for the refugees from East Pakistan.|$|E
50|$|Rhymed {{pairs of}} iambic pentameter lines form the heroic couplet. Two {{masters of the}} form are Alexander Pope and John Dryden. The form has proven {{especially}} suited <b>to</b> <b>conveying</b> wit and sardonic humor, as in the opening of Pope's An Essay on Criticism.|$|R
50|$|After the {{traditional}} fifty day mourning period, Tama was succeeded by her deputy, Nitama. Nitama's first official duty was <b>to</b> be <b>conveyed</b> <b>to</b> her predecessor's shrine {{to pay her}} respects.|$|R

5|$|The {{creation}} of {{life from the}} disintegration of an Engineer in the film's opening scene was created by WETA Digital. The scene was difficult to produce because it had <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> {{the story of the}} Engineer's DNA breaking apart, reforming and recombining into Earth DNA in a limited span of time. The team focused on making the DNA stages distinct <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> its changing nature. Scott requested the studio to focus on the destruction occurring within the Engineer. A light color scheme was used for the Engineer's DNA and decayed fish spines were used as an image reference, while the infected DNA had a melted appearance. To find methods of depicting the DNA destruction, the team carved vein-like structures from silicone and pumped black ink and oils into them while filming the changes occurring {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>convey</b> {{accurate}} information, it {{soon became}} necessary to have a standard vocabulary describing clouds; this was achieved {{by means of a}} series of classifications first achieved by Luke Howard in 1802, and standardized in the International Cloud Atlas of 1896.|$|E
5|$|Development {{started in}} early 2014 and took {{fourteen}} {{months to go}} into full production. The concept was contributed by Keiji Inafune, who wished <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> the idea of surviving in a world verging on human extinction. The developers first {{came up with the}} robots, whose anatomical design problems would later be solved by the insertion of cores – essentially robot souls – to explain their propulsion. Writer Joseph Staten resolved to create a simple story to enhance an emotional backdrop more grounded in complexity.|$|E

5|$|During presidential elections, {{candidates}} may advertise on the Internet {{except on}} the eve of polling day and polling day itself. However, on those days, it remains legal for people <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> their own political views on a non-commercial basis to others by telephonic or electronic transmission, and election advertising may remain unaltered on the Internet if it was lawfully published before the eve of polling day.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Wilcher {{released}} Heaven-Haven. The {{music was}} performed by The Linden String Quartet. During production of the CD, Wilcher saw press reports about the fatal attack of 18-year-old Sydney resident Thomas Kelly; Wilcher was unable to separate the sorrow he felt for Kelly and his family from the sentiment he was trying <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> through his music. He eventually dedicated the project to Kelly and announced that proceeds from the album would benefit the Thomas Kelly Youth Foundation.|$|E
5|$|In his memoirs, Ismay {{recalled}} {{that he never}} solved the puzzle of how <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> his very genuine concerns of the time to the right people. A thrown sticky bomb simply would not reliably stick to a vertical surface. However, the bomb would stick if it was thrown onto {{the top of a}} tank where the plates were more or less horizontal – and thinner – but this reduced the throwing range to twenty yards at the most – getting that close would only be possible in an ambush or in street fighting.|$|E

6000|$|... "My dear Frederick, you {{are talking}} quite idly. Pray, what would become of us poor sailors' wives, who often want <b>to</b> be <b>conveyed</b> <b>to</b> one port or another, after our husbands, if {{everybody}} had your feelings?" ...|$|R
5|$|In {{parallel}} {{with the construction of}} the works, trunk sewers were built <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> sewage from the city to the works. These was a major programme of expansion to the sewer network in 1910, to ensure that it could cope with the expected volumes of effluent produced. Because British sewers are also expected to handle rainwater, a series of storm sewage overflows were provided, which resulted in diluted sewage being discharged into the River Don in times of heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Mason's {{policies}} {{led him to}} {{come into}} constant clashes with the Conservative members of the council. He was not always popular {{within his own party}} either and he even financed his own newspaper, the Ashton-under-Lyne News, <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> his views and provide competition for the pro-Liberal Ashton Reporter. Conflict with the Liberals drove Mason into early retirement from local politics in 1874 at the age of 57.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{initially}} {{appeared to}} be recovering, but took {{a turn for the}} worse on September 13 as his wounds became gangrenous, and died early the next morning; Vice President Theodore Roosevelt succeeded him. Roosevelt was hiking near the top of Mt. Marcy, in New York State's Adirondack region, when a runner located him <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> the bad news. After McKinley's murder, for which Czolgosz was put to death in the electric chair, the United States Congress passed legislation to officially charge the Secret Service with the responsibility for protecting the president.|$|E
60|$|Carlyle {{was still}} in Scotland on April 21, and there the terrible and solemn news had <b>to</b> be <b>conveyed</b> <b>to</b> him of {{the sudden death of}} her who had been his true and {{faithful}} life-companion for forty years.|$|R
40|$|John Hatch {{examines}} the friendship between Theo Van Doesburg and El Lissitzky, which was fuelled by a shared interest in scientific theories. Both moved from painting to architecture in seeking out a form best suited <b>to</b> <b>conveying</b> the spatiotemporal experiences phrased by Relativity, resulting in some remarkably innovative architectural designs and theories...|$|R
5000|$|The journal was {{established}} in 1999 by John S. Rigden and Roger H. Stuewer, [...] "to recognize historical and philosophical studies as essential to understanding the foundations of physics, to appreciating the diffusion of physics into all areas of science, and <b>to</b> <b>conveying</b> the cultural influence of physics on the arts and humanities." ...|$|R
5|$|Modern scholarship, {{noting the}} way in which similar {{accounts}} were associated in ancient times with the deaths of notable figures, sees the phenomenon as a literary invention that attempts <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> a sense of the power of Jesus in the face of death, or a sign of God's displeasure with the Jewish people. Scholars have also noted the ways in which this episode appears to draw on earlier biblical accounts of darkness from the Old Testament.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Paul retains {{elements}} of a powerful and alert patriarch. The painting is set at a curious angle, so that although Paul is positioned low in the pictorial space, the viewer still looks upwards towards him as if in respect. He is dressed in full pomp, wearing wide fur-lined sleeves (a typical Venetian device <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> status), and his cape is laid across his upper body to suggest physical presence.|$|E
5|$|Other themes include {{chance and}} coincidence. During Chasing Vermeer, Charles Fort's book, Lo!, inspires the {{children}} to list {{and pay attention to}} coincidences as they realize that they are more than what they seem and explore the concept that they make up one unexplained pattern. Balliett stated that she wanted <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> how coincidences were noticeable and felt meaningful, and how they could matter even if they were unexplainable.|$|E
25|$|The Emperor of China was {{to appoint}} Na't'ung {{to be his}} Envoy Extraordinary and direct him <b>to</b> also <b>convey</b> <b>to</b> the Emperor of Japan, his {{expression}} of regrets {{and that of his}} Government at the assassination of Mr. Sugiyama.|$|R

40|$|When New Zealand bound itself militarily to Great Britain at the {{outbreak}} of war with Germany in August 1914, discussion arose over how {{the news of the}} conflict was <b>to</b> be <b>conveyed</b> <b>to</b> readers back home. This chapter considers how news of the war on the Western Front was <b>conveyed</b> <b>to</b> New Zealanders back home and the role played by the country's first official war correspondent, Malcolm Ross...|$|R
