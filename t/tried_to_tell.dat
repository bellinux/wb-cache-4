The doctors <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him that the increased radiation dose would kill him, {{but he said it}} wouldn't, and that anyway he would die without it. The higher dose did its job and his cancer never returned. This treatment became standard for many cancers and is still used.|$|E
5|$|After the {{standoff}} entered its fourth hour, Valencia {{succeeded in getting}} Saldívar to confess that she had intended to shoot herself. Saldívar said when she placed the gun to her own head, Selena <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her not to kill herself. When Selena {{opened the door to}} leave, Saldívar said she told her to close it. She also said the gun went off when Selena left. During the sixth hour, Saldívar agreed to give herself up, but when she saw a police officer pointing a rifle at her, she panicked, ran back to her truck, picked up the revolver, and pointed it at her head again. Saldívar surrendered after more than nine hours. By then, hundreds of Selena's fans had gathered at the scene; many wept as police took Saldívar away. A press conference was called within hours of Selena's murder; Saldívar had not yet been named in media reports. Assistant Police Chief Ken Bung and Quintanilla, Jr. told the press the possible motive was Selena's intention to terminate Saldívar's employment.|$|E

25|$|The raid {{started a}} few minutes before midnight, when policemen massed outside the school. A police officer {{attacked}} British journalist Mark Covell, who <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them he was a journalist.

According to Covell, one policeman kicked him in the chest, breaking half-a-dozen ribs whose splintered ends then shredded the membrane of his left lung, and laughed. Other policemen kicked him around, breaking his hand and damaging his spine. The police then used an armoured police van to break through the school gates and 150 policemen, wearing crash helmets and carrying truncheons and shields, entered the school compound.|$|E

25|$|In May 1980 Union Rotorua was on {{passage from}} Tauranga to Sydney when she broke down 200 {{miles west of}} Cape Maria van Diemen. Union Rotoiti was only 80 miles away and the two masters agreed to attempt a tow. Captain Andrew Keyworth, {{one of the most}} senior masters of the USSCo, was the master of Union Rotoiti. With much skill on his part, and while the ships were {{sometimes}} only 25 metres apart, a line was made fast between the two ships by use of a line-carrying rocket. Once the tow began 422nm were covered in just over 56 hours at an average speed of 7.5 knots. It was a feat never before accomplished with two ships of this size, and Captain John Warren of Union Rotorua later exclaimed: ‘If anyone had previously <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me it was possible … I would have thought them quite barmy’.|$|E
25|$|The {{autopilot}} {{reached the}} limits of its programming and disengaged. After checking their circuit breakers {{for the source of}} the warnings, the crew then reduced thrust to lower the speed. This immediately triggered the 757's stick-shaker stall alert, warning the confused pilots that the aircraft was flying dangerously slow, seconds after it was warning them that the speed was too high. The co-pilot and the relief pilot Muhlis Evrenesoğlu both seemed to recognise the approaching stall and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the captain, but did not intervene directly, possibly out of deference to the captain's age and experience. The captain then tried to recover from the stall by increasing the plane's thrust to full, but the plane was still in a nose up attitude, preventing the engines from receiving adequate airflow to match the increase in thrust. The left engine flamed out, which caused the right engine, still at full power, to throw the aircraft into a spin. Moments later, the plane inverted. At 11:47p.m., the Ground Proximity Warning System sounded an audio warning, and eight seconds later the plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. All 13 crew members and 176 passengers were killed.|$|E
25|$|By this point, some {{prominent}} members of Mussolini's government had turned against him. Among them were Grandi and Ciano. Several {{of his colleagues}} were close to revolt, and Mussolini was forced to summon the Grand Council of Fascism on 24 July 1943. This {{was the first time}} that body had met since the start of the war. When he announced that the Germans were thinking of evacuating the south, Grandi launched a blistering attack on him. Grandi moved a resolution asking the king to resume his full constitutional powers which was, in effect, a vote of no confidence in Mussolini. This motion carried by a 19–8 margin. Despite this sharp rebuke, Mussolini showed up for work the next day as usual. He allegedly viewed the Grand Council as merely an advisory body and did not think the vote would have any substantive effect. That afternoon, he was summoned to the royal palace by King Victor Emmanuel III, who had been planning to oust Mussolini earlier. When Mussolini <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the king about the meeting, Victor Emmanuel cut him off and told him that he was being replaced by Marshal Pietro Badoglio. After Mussolini left the palace, he was arrested by Carabinieri on the king's orders.|$|E

[...] Sondheim noted, [...] "Allegro was an attempt to use epic theatre in contemporary musical theatre.

It {{originated}} in the 1940s with arrangers who drew from modernist composers such as Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith. Its [...] "progressive" [...] features were replete with dissonance, atonality, and brash effects. Progressive jazz was most popularized by the bandleader Stan Kenton during the 1940s. Critics were initially wary of the idiom. Dizzy Gillespie wrote in his autobiography; [...] "They tried to make Stan Kenton a 'white hope,' called modern jazz and my music 'progressive,' then <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me I played 'progressive' music.
