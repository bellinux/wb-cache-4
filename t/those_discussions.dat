Pascal even invited Jolie for a Bond girl role, but the actress playfully replied that she {{was more interested in}} playing James Bond himself instead. Jolie was sent Salts script in September 2008 and liked it.

The Vietnamese military immediately responded to Kampuchean actions by launching a counter-attack and removing Kampuchean forces from Phu Quoc and Tho Chu, and then invading the Kampuchean island of Koh Wai. In June 1975, {{while on a}} visit to Hanoi, Kampuchean leader Pol Pot proposed that Vietnam and his country should sign a treaty of friendship and begin discussions on border disputes. However, <b>those</b> <b>discussions</b> never materialised, and the Kampucheans claimed that Vietnam turned down both offers.

The state had a medicinal marijuana law that allowed patients to obtain cards to purchase marijuana legally, but as of March 2010, an average of 1,000 people were applying for the cards each day, and many of the applications were of questionable validity and intent.

2500|$|In the {{historical}} literature Peter {{is thought to}} have been: boyar, great boil, comita, ichirgu-boil [...] and kavhan (conditional or unconditional). The discussion on the title (or office) of Peter is part of the scientific discussion on the place of the ichirgu-boil and the kavhan in the administration of the First Bulgarian Empire. The starting point of <b>those</b> <b>discussions</b> is that there were one kavhan and one ichirgu-boil {{at the same time and}} that the kavhan is the higher office. The different views on the functions of Peter comes from the different interpretation of {{the historical}} sources (the letters of Pope John VIII, the notes of the Cividale gospel and the story of Anastasius Bibliothecarius about the Council of Constantinople).|$|E
