After the motor unit is stimulated, its pulse is then recorded by the electrode and displayed as an action potential, known as a motor unit action potential (MUAP).

The time in between these pulses is known as the inter-pulse interval (IPI).

40|$|The Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) {{baseline}} {{is subject}} to various changes. Changes are necessary due to safety and quality improvements, environmental considerations, vendor changes, obsolescence issues, etc. The RSRM program has a goal to test changes on full-scale static test motors prior to flight due to the unique RSRM operating environment. Each static <b>test</b> <b>motor</b> incorporates several significant changes and numerous minor changes. Flight motors often implement multiple changes simultaneously. While each change is individually verified and assessed, the potential for changes to interact constitutes additional hidden risk. Mitigating this risk depends upon identification of potential interactions. Therefore, the ATK Thiokol Propulsion System Safety organization initiated {{the use of a}} risk interaction matrix to identify potential interactions that compound risk. Identifying risk interactions supports flight and <b>test</b> <b>motor</b> decisions. Uncovering hidden risks of a full-scale static <b>test</b> <b>motor</b> gives a broader perspective of the changes being tested. This broader perspective compels the program to focus on solutions for implementing RSRM changes with minimal/mitigated risk.

40|$|The paired {{motor unit}} {{analysis}} provides in vivo {{estimates of the}} magnitude of persistent inward currents (PIC) in human motoneurons by quantifying changes in the firing rate (ΔF) of an earlier recruited (reference) motor unit at the time of recruitment and derecruitment of a later recruited (<b>test)</b> <b>motor</b> unit. This study assessed the variability of ΔF estimates, and quantified the dependence of ΔF on the discharge characteristics of the motor units selected for analysis. ΔF was calculated for 158 pairs of motor units recorded from nine healthy individuals during repeated submaximal contractions of the tibialis anterior muscle. The mean (SD) ΔF was 3. 7 (2. 5) pps (range − 4. 2 to 8. 9 pps). The median absolute difference in ΔF for the same motor unit pair across trials was 1. 8 pps, and the minimal detectable change in ΔF required to exceed measurement error was 4. 8 pps. ΔF was positively related to the amount of discharge rate modulation in the reference motor unit (r 2 = 0. 335; P < 0. 001), and inversely related to the rate of increase in discharge rate (r 2 = 0. 125; P < 0. 001). A quadratic function provided the best fit for relations between ΔF and the time between recruitment of the reference and <b>test</b> <b>motor</b> units (r 2 = 0. 229, P < 0. 001), the duration of <b>test</b> <b>motor</b> unit activity (r 2 = 0. 110, P < 0. 001), and the recruitment threshold of the <b>test</b> <b>motor</b> unit (r 2 = 0. 237, P < 0. 001). Physiological and methodological contributions to the variability in ΔF estimates of PIC magnitude are discussed, and selection criteria to reduce these sources of variability are suggested for the paired motor unit analysis...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{theoretical}} {{work has}} shown that when all loss mechanisms are neglected the constant power speed range (CPSR) of a brushless dc motor (BDCM) is infinite when the motor {{is driven by the}} dual-mode inverter control (DMIC) [1, 2]. In a physical drive, losses, particularly speed-sensitive losses, will limit the CPSR to a finite value. In this paper we report the results of laboratory testing of a low-inductance, 7. 5 -hp BDCM driven by the DMIC. The speed rating of the <b>test</b> <b>motor</b> rotor limited the upper speed of the testing, and the results show that the CPSR of the test machine is greater than 6 : 1 when driven by the DMIC. Current wave shape, peak, and rms values remained controlled and within rating over the entire speed range. The laboratory measurements allowed the speed-sensitive losses to be quantified and incorporated into computer simulation models, which then accurately reproduce the results of lab testing. The simulator shows that the limiting CPSR of the <b>test</b> <b>motor</b> is 8 : 1. These results confirm that the DMIC is capable of driving low-inductance BDCMs over the wide CPSR that would be required in electric vehicle applications. 1...|$|E
40|$|Real-time char line {{recession}} {{measurements were}} made on propellant inhibitors of the Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM). The RSRM FSM- 8 static <b>test</b> <b>motor</b> propellant inhibitors (composed of a rubber insulation material) were successfully instrumented with eroding potentiometers and thermocouples. The data was used to establish inhibitor recession versus time relationships. Normally, pre-fire and post-fire insulation thickness measurements establish the thermal performance of an ablating insulation material. However, post-fire inhibitor decomposition and recession measurements are {{complicated by the fact}} that most of the inhibitor is back during motor operation.
