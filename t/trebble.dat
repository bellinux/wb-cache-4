"Considering {{the place}} he is to hold in his own colony when he returns, and the stock he comes from, let me tell you, that he hath not means enough allowed him to support his station, {{and is likely to}} make the more depence from the narrowness of his income--from sheer despair {{breaking}} out of all bounds, and becoming extravagant, which is not his turn. But he likes to live as well as the rest of his company, and, between ourselves, has fell into some of the finist and most rakish in England. He thinks 'tis for the honour of the family not to go back, and many a time calls for ortolans and champaign when he would as leaf dine with a stake and a mugg of beer. And in this kind of spirit I have no doubt from what he hath told me in his talk (which is very naif, as the French say), that his mamma hath encouraged him in his high opinion of himself. We women like our belongings to have it, however little we love to pay the cost.

Please God, I shall be able to leave Henry Esmond's grandson something at my death; but my savings are small, and the pension with which my gracious Sovereign hath endowed me dies with me. As for feu M. de Bernstein, he left only debt at his decease: the officers of his Majesty's Electoral Court of Hannover are but scantily paid.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerning}} about design of an audio power amplifier for home listening. Amplifier involves two audioprocessors, {{the first one}} chooses {{one of the four}} avaliable audio stereo inputs. The second just sets the considered shape of frequency characteristic of one of the picked audio signal. As soon as tha signal leaves the audiprocessors, its path is divided. First route leads to the power amplifier and second one ends up in the analog to digital converter. Both audiprocessors are adjusted via IIC line by 8 -bit microcontroller. The primary role of microcontroller is to enumerate frequency coefficients through the fast fourier transformation with Cooley-tukey algorithm. Result of FFT is then displayed on graphical display unit. The whole desired parametres as volume, <b>trebble,</b> input selection, atc., are driven with one controller and that is a rotary encoder...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The ternary {{systems of}} water with 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol and 1 -butanol or ethanol, {{important}} in industrial applications, have been chosen for investigating the vapour ^ liquid equilibria (VLE) of systems with highly associating components and liquid ^ liquid separation (VLLE). A static equilibrium apparatus with two vibrating tube densimeters (made of glass) for measuring the densities of vapour and liquid developed by Rott (1990, PhD thesis, Universita « t-GH-Paderborn) has been modified and tested up to 30 bar and 200 8 C (for densities only up to 150 8 C). Vapour and liquid are circulated through the densimeters and the equilibrium cell by two micrometering pumps. All parts of the apparatus containing the test fluid are temperature-controlled at phase equilibrium temperature. Samples of vapour and liquid(s) are analysed by gas chromatography (GC-MSD). The VLE and VLLE of the ternary systems water ^ 1 -butanol ^ 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol, ethanol ^ water ^ 1 -butanol, and ethanol ^water ^ 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol and of the pertaining binaries have been investigated between 100 and 200 8 C. Parallel to the measurements, the VLE and VLLE have been calculated by cubic equations of state (CEOS) of <b>Trebble</b> ^ Bishnoi ^ Salim (TBS) type. The deviations between the measurements and calculations for the saturation pressure and the densities and compositions of vapour and liquid at equilibrium do not exceed a few percent. Currently, association terms are being incorporated in the CEOS {{in order to reduce}} the deviations. ...|$|E
