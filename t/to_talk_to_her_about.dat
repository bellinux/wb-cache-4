She wrote in her diary on 15 March 1910 that she could not {{understand}} the family's regard for Rasputin as [...] "almost a saint" [...] when she viewed him as only a [...] "khlyst". Tyutcheva told Grand Duchess Xenia that the starets visited when Olga and Tatiana were getting ready for bed and sat there talking with them and [...] "caressing" [...] them. The girls hid his presence from their governess and were afraid <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> Rasputin. Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova, another nurse for the royal children, was at first a devotee of Rasputin, but later was disillusioned by him. She claimed that she was raped by Rasputin in the spring of 1910. The empress refused to believe her, Vishnyakova told investigators, and said everything Rasputin did was holy. Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova's claim had been immediately investigated, but [...] "they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard." [...] Vishnyakova was dismissed from her post in 1913.|$|E
2500|$|Though Westbrook {{initially}} enjoyed {{her time}} {{back at the}} soap, {{she was unable to}} keep her working life and private life separate. Off-screen, her partying and drug-use (both in and out of work) began to affect her performance. Her cast mates attempted to curtail the problem. Actors such as Wendy Richard and Mike Reid requested that Westbrook's dressing room be situated near theirs and away from the younger cast, because they could see she was [...] "vulnerable". They attempted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> her drug problem, but Westbrook ignored their concerns and continued using. She has revealed that she became so affected by cocaine that she would continuously mess up her lines, had to do take after take, was constantly late and needed prompts, and spontaneously fell asleep, once even passing out while she stood {{at the top of the}} Queen Vic stairs during filming, and was only saved from harming herself by Ross Kemp who caught her in his arms. She has commented, [...] "When I watch re-runs of those scenes now I can't believe how out of it I look." [...] Many of the newer, younger cast members began to shun her, laughing at her and throwing peanuts at her during filming every time she attempted to deliver her lines. Eventually, the producers tired of Westbrook. She has revealed: [...] "the producers now had serious doubts about my future on the soap. I was proving to be a liability. My behaviour was interfering with the schedule. It was interfering with other cast members' work. There were days when I just didn't bother showing up for work at all. The dilemma they faced was what to do with me. They had only just written [...] back into the soap; now, within months, they were having to write her out of it all over again. They felt bad about getting rid of me, too. I could tell they felt responsible for me but of course ultimately there wasn't much they could do to help [...] Within a couple of weeks I was called into a meeting and told very politely that they were going to let me go early and terminate my contract. They would, they explained, gradually write my character out of the scripts again, which would take a couple of months to do." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes. But {{there is}} a {{difference}} between then and now, ma'am.

6000|$|When I went up <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> George I {{found her}} in the bedroom nursing the baby, who was very good and quiet on her knee.
