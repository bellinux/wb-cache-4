40|$|The use of {{input-output}} {{analysis for the}} computation of secondary effects of final demand changes is well-known. These 'final demand effects' can be calculated using <b>technical</b> <b>coefficients</b> and the inverse of the Leontief matrix. This paper offers {{an alternative to the}} use of <b>technical</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Its goal is threefold. First of all degrees of dependency are defined and it is shown how they can be used to compute secondary effects. Their definition is based on an input-output table. Secondly the concept of secondary effects is extended to what is called indirect effects. These indirect effects are not only related to final demand but to total industry output. It is shown how these indirect effects can be calculated using <b>technical</b> <b>coefficients</b> or degrees of dependency. The method used is a variant of the so-called Hypothetical Extraction Methods. Double counting is avoided, as such the resulting multipliers are 'net multipliers'. It is formally demonstrated that <b>technical</b> <b>coefficients</b> and degrees of dependency give the same results when a recent input-output table is available. If {{this is not the case}} then the results are different. It is impossible to say which of the two estimates is better. Since <b>technical</b> <b>coefficients</b> are already broadly accepted, some examples are given to justify the use of degrees of dependency. Finally it is explained how the unavailability of an input-output table can be solved. Starting from the supply-use tables a 'quick and dirty method' to infer an input-output table is provided. This topic is justified by the fact that for Belgium input-output tables are only published for those years that are divisible by five, with a three year lag. A short empirical analysis, based on currently available data, shows that <b>technical</b> <b>coefficients</b> and degrees of dependency have comparable performance, with a slight advantage for the <b>technical</b> <b>coefficients.</b> This performance is measured relative to a 'right' result, being the indirect effects for the year 2000 computed using the now available input-output table for the year 2000. This result is called 'right' because it does not make any assumptions on stability of <b>technical</b> <b>coefficients</b> nor of degrees of dependency. The empirical analysis also compares the use of a recent supply-use table to the use of an old input-output table. Supply-use tables on average overestimate the 'right' result. They are however often closest to the 'right' result at the first level. Since these conclusions are based on limited data further analysis is required as more data becomes available. indirect effects, {{input-output analysis}}, degrees of dependency, <b>technical</b> <b>coefficients,</b> net multiplier...|$|R

This assumption is realistic when the production {{is based on}} machines {{as it is the}} case in manufacturing. On the other hand, production planning in the service sector involves humans instead of machines. Consequently, the assumption that all <b>technical</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the mathematical program are constant cannot hold anymore. This is especially the case for productivity parameters related to human activity. It is well known for instance that in the service sector when administrative tasks are repetitive and boring, working overload has a direct impact on the employee productivity. We have adapted a manufacturing planning model producing industrial goods into a service production planning model. In this service model, employees with different job status (junior, senior and expert) are handling cases of specific difficulties (simple, standard, personal and special). Then, we have introduced a variable productivity formula into the mathematical program that takes into account “plateau” levels assuming diminishing productivities. To do so the mathematical program includes integer variables as well as non-linearity and thus becomes a NLMIP (Non Linear Mixed Integer Program). A fictitious case study is presented. The initial service production planning model with constant <b>technical</b> <b>coefficient</b> leads to solutions involving job specialization. On the other hand the model version with the variable productivity formula offers a better workload balance and more possibilities of job polyvalence reducing thus human risks such as burn-outs...|$|E

Results are used to identify critical quality characteristics and impacts of <b>technical</b> <b>coefficient</b> uncertainty on import demand. The expected values for most characteristics of U.

Key words: import demand, quality, uncertainty, wheat. In many commodity markets, differences in quality characteristics and prices have an im-portant impact on competition among exporting countries. Ladd and Martin's (1976) input char-acteristics model (lCM) provides an appropriate foundation for analyzing demand for inputs with different characteristics. The ICM has not been used to analyze demand in agricultural trade, even though a large proportion is comprised of raw commodities.

In the context of Natural Resource Management Systems (NRMS), {{one of the main}} methodological challenges, which is the objective of this thesis, is the development of a methodological framework for sustainability evaluation via indicators at different scales of analysis (e. g. farm household and region). In this thesis, the methodological development and application of a framework for multi-scale sustainability evaluation of NRMS are presented. The framework offers a structured and coherent set of guidelines, developed from an interdisciplinary and systemic perspective, to select, quantify, assess and integrate case-specific indicators derived from short and long term environmental, economic and social concerns (objectives, aspirations) of stakeholders. The analysis of key issues related to the sustainability of NRMS at different scales in the Cercle de Koutiala in the South of Mali illustrates the application of the framework for derivation and quantification of indicators for sustainability evaluation at farm household, Arrondissement and Cercle scale. By means of quantitative system analysis tools (e. g. simulation and linear programming models, <b>technical</b> <b>coefficient</b> generator), the framework provides insight in the potentials and limitations of alternatives for NRMS designed at different scales (e. g. policy measures or technological innovations) and the trade-offs between indicators relevant for different stakeholders. The framework explores biophysical opportunities and limitations, rather than predicting behaviour of actors. The multi-scale sustainability evaluation framework can reveal tensions between objectives across and within scales. I ndicators retain their explicit meaning, which allows their use in support of a transparent and open dialogue among stakeholders, from their own perspective and in the light of their own aspirations; which is an indispensable step in the initiation of collaborative efforts in the design and implementation of alternatives at different scales for more sustainable NRM...|$|E

The IIM adopts the same principles as the standard I-O model but uses a perturbation vector instead of absolute changes in final demand. The perturbation vector gives values of inoperability between 0 and 1 for directly affected infrastructure sectors. The level of inoperability is usually defined as unrealized production (intended degradation of actual production) divided by the full amount of intended production.
