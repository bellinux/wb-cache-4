50|$|Lipaphis pseudobrassicae is an aphid of {{the family}} Aphididae. Its common name is <b>Turnip</b> <b>Aphid.</b>|$|E
50|$|Originally a European species, the <b>turnip</b> <b>aphid</b> is {{now found}} {{in most parts of}} the world in {{tropical}} and temperate locations. Host plants include cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale, kohlrabi, radish and turnip, as well as shepherd's purse, wild mustard and other cruciferous weeds.|$|E
50|$|Lipaphis erysimi is {{a species}} of aphid of the family Aphididae. Its common names include mustard aphid and <b>turnip</b> <b>aphid.</b> It is found in most {{temperate}} and tropical {{areas of the world}} and feeds only on cruciferous plants. The insects are almost exclusively female and are very prolific, with wingless females producing around one hundred young during a lifespan of a few weeks.|$|E
40|$|Replicated {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to examine aphid distribution and insecticidal control in a commercial cauliflower seed crop in 2001, and in large plots at the Yuma Agricultural Center in 2003. Results were generally consistent in both studies. The primary aphid species found colonizing pre-blooming crops were cabbage <b>aphids,</b> <b>turnip</b> <b>aphids,</b> and green peach aphids. During the bloom period (March-April), the population was almost exclusively cabbage aphid feeding on seed pods and extensions. During the pre-bloom growth period, green peach aphids tended to colonize plants slightly earlier and were found primarily on the older frame leaves low on the plant. In most cases, male and female plants were colonized to the same extent. Cabbage and <b>turnip</b> <b>aphids</b> {{did not appear to}} have a clear preference between older and younger leaves, and appeared to colonize males and females equally. Once the plant began to bloom and set seed, cabbage aphid was the primary species (> 90 %) found feeding on developing seed pods in both tests. These aphid populations were very susceptible to contact insecticides and quickly knocked down by both Capture and MSR. Of the selective, bee safe products, Pirimor provided the most consistent residual aphid control. Assail and Fulfill worked well against aphids on foliage, but did not provide comparable control on seed pods. Aphid densities were extremely high in the untreated check and resulted in almost complete loss of the crop in these plots. Seed yields were not taken due to heavy losses to Sclerotinia and bird damage...|$|R
40|$|Inoculation of the semi-persistent {{cauliflower}} mosaic virus (CaMV, genus Caulimovirus) {{is associated with}} successive brief (5 - 10 s) intracellular stylet punctures (pd) when aphids probe in epidermal and mesophyll cells. In contrast to non-persistent viruses, {{there is no evidence}} for which of the pd subphases (II- 1, II- 2 and II- 3) is involved in the inoculation of CaMV. Experiments were conducted using the electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique to investigate which particular subphases of the pd are associated with the inoculation of CaMV to <b>turnip</b> by its <b>aphid</b> vector Brevicoryne brassicae. In addition, the same aphid species/test plant combination was used to compare the role of the pd subphases in the inoculation of the non-persistent turnip mosaic virus (TuMV, genus Potyvirus). Inoculation of TuMV was found to be related to subphase II- 1, confirming earlier results, but CaMV inoculation appeared to be related exclusively to subphase II- 2 instead. The mechanism of CaMV inoculation and the possible nature of subphase II- 2 are discussed in the scope of our findings...|$|R
40|$|Herbivore-induced plant {{volatiles}} provide foraging cues for herbivores and for herbivores’ natural enemies. Aphids induce plant volatile {{emissions and}} also utilize plant-derived olfactory volatile cues, but the chemical ecology of aphids and other phloem-feeding insects is less extensively documented {{than that of}} chewing insects. Here, we characterize the volatile cues emitted by turnip plants (Brassica rapa) under attack by an aphid (Myzus persicae) or by the chewing lepidopteran larva Heliothis virescens. We also tested the behavioral responses of M. persicae individuals to the odors of undamaged and herbivore-damaged plants presented singly or in combination, {{as well as to}} the odor of crushed conspecifics (simulating predation). Gas chromatographic analysis of the volatile blend of infested turnips revealed distinct profiles for both aphid- and caterpillar- induced plants, with induced compounds including green-leaf alcohols, esters, and isothiocyanates. In behavioral trials, aphids exhibited increased activity in the presence of plant odors and positive attraction to undamaged <b>turnip</b> plants. However, <b>aphids</b> exhibited a strong preference for the odors of healthy versus plants subjected to herbivore damage, and neither aphid- or caterpillar-damaged plants were attractive compared to clean-air controls. Reduced aphid attraction to herbivore-infested plants may bemediated by changes in the volatile blend constituent composition, including large amounts of isothiocyanates and green-leaf volatiles or, in the case of aphid-infested plants, of the aphid alarm pheromone, (E) -b-farnesene.

50|$|The <b>turnip</b> <b>aphid</b> {{is almost}} entirely viviparous, {{although}} eggs have occasionally been seen. It is extremely prolific and in warm places such as Texas, a maximum of thirty-five generations per year have been recorded. The wingless females produce up to six offspring per day {{over a period of}} twenty to forty days, a total of eighty to one hundred young. Winged females are able to disperse to other plants, but produce fewer offspring.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many species}} of ladybirds, the {{transverse}} ladybird {{plays an important role}} in agriculture as it preys on a wide array of plant-eating insects which damage crops, particularly early in the growing season. Among those insects hunted include {{many species of}} aphids, including the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), Aphis affinis, cowpea aphid (Aphis craccivora), cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii), milkweed aphid (Aphis nerii), spirea aphid (Aphis spiraecola), leafcurling plum aphid (Brachycaudus helichrysi), cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae), Cervaphis quercus, Cervaphis rappardi indica, <b>turnip</b> <b>aphid</b> (Lipaphis pseudobrassicae), Macrosiphoniella yomogifoliae, potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae), rose aphid (Macrosiphum rosae), Melanaphis donacis, Melanaphis sacchari, Myzus nicotianae, green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), Pentalonia nigronervosa, corn aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis), Sitobion rosaeiformis, Taoia indica, Toxoptera aurantii, Therioaphis ononidis, Therioaphis trifolii, Uroleucon compositae and Uroleucon sonchi, species of leafhopper including Empoascanara indica and Idioscopus clypealis, the scale insect species Orthezia insignis, the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri), the cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera), and oriental leafworm moth (Spodoptera litura).|$|E
40|$|The <b>turnip</b> <b>aphid</b> Lipaphis pseudobrassicae (Davis) is {{considered}} a cosmopolitan pest of cruciferous crops. It removes photoassimilates from the crops and is responsible for transmitting a number of plans viruses. Control of the <b>turnip</b> <b>aphid</b> is important in stable production of cruciferous crops. The present study was carried out to determine the efficacy of leaf extract from the pongam tree Pongamia pinnata L. against the <b>turnip</b> <b>aphid.</b> In laboratory tests, pongam leaf extract showed acute toxicity to the turnip aphid; the LC 50 values were 0. 585 %, 0. 151 % and 0. 113 % at 24, 48 and 72 hours, respectively. Laboratory observations also indicated that low concentrations of pongam leaf extract caused significant reduction of vitality and fertility of the turnip aphids of the subsequent generation and thus caused an indirect reduction of overall pest numbers in the next generation. Pongam leaf extract has thus nonlethal chronic toxicity. Therefore, pongam leaf extract can be recommended as an organic–based pesticide to manage the <b>turnip</b> <b>aphid...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} on relative resistance and susceptibility among 22 cultivars of Brassica napus was laid {{down and it}} was observed that cultivars shiralee and hybrid were susceptible to <b>turnip</b> <b>aphid,</b> while the other cultivars were resistant or partially resistant to <b>turnip</b> <b>aphid</b> at leaf stage. The cultivars crusher, hybrid and shiralee were highly susceptible at flowering and the cultivars sponser, deffender, shiralee and cyclone were highly susceptible at seed formation and the oscer and cyclone were susceptible at seed maturity stage. As a whole the cultivar shiralee was highly susceptible while the cultivars hybrid, cyclone, RNB- 9604 D, deffender and oscer were intermediately susceptible. Similarly the cultivars sponser, CON-III, crusher, KS - 75, BULLT, 19 -H, dunkled and BLN- 971 were partially resistant and the cultivars Yol- 9, rainbow, CON-I, CON-II, CCS- 01 and BLN- 877 showed relative resistance among all 22 cultivars of Brassica napus against <b>turnip</b> <b>aphid,</b> Lipaphis erysimi Kalt...|$|E
40|$|The <b>turnip</b> <b>aphid</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} and widely distributed pests of turnip, mustard, radish, and related crops in the United States. It causes heavy losses to growers of these crops every year, especially in the Southern States. Dust mixtures containing derris, cube, or nicotine, and sprays containing derris or cube, will control the <b>turnip</b> <b>aphid</b> when applied properly. The first application of insecticides should be made when the plants are very small, and additional applications should be made at intervals of 7 to 14 days up to the time of harvest. To provide for effective application of insecticides, the seed of susceptible crops should be planted in drills, with the rows spaced uniformly apart. The following cultural practices aid in the successful production of crops exposed to <b>turnip</b> <b>aphid</b> attack: (1) A well-prepared, fertile seedbed to produce thrifty and rapidly growing plants, (2) planting the seed in drills to permit cultivation, (3) harvesting early to shorten the period of exposure to infestation, (4) destroying crop remnants to eliminate a common sources of infestation to succeeding crops, and (5) applying a nitrogenous fertilizer to stimulate plant growth.

40|$|Secondary {{metabolites}} {{are important}} in plant defence against pests and diseases. Similarly, insects can use plant secondary metabolites in defence and, in some cases, synthesize their own products. The paper describes how two specialist brassica feeders, Brevicoryne brassicae (cabbage aphid) and Lipaphis erysimi (<b>turnip</b> <b>aphid)</b> can sequester glucosinolates (thioglucosides) from their host plants, yet avoid the generation of toxic degradation products by compartmentalizing myrosinase (thioglucosidase) into crystalline microbodies. We propose that death, or damage, to the insect by predators or disease causes disruption of compartmentalized myrosinase, which results in the release of isothiocyanate {{that acts as a}} synergist for the alarm pheromone E-beta-farnesene...|$|E
40|$|Aphidius transcaspicus Telenga, a mealy {{plum aphid}} (Hyalopterus pruni Geoffroy) {{parasitoid}} from the Mediterranean, was recently introduced into Hawaii for control of invasive aphids. Under laboratory conditions the parasitoid successfully attacked several important aphid pests in Hawaii, including the melon aphid Aphis gossypii Glover, the banana aphid Pentalonia nigronervosa (Coquerel), the green peach aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer), the corn leaf aphid Rhopolosiphum maidis (Fitch), and the cowpea aphid Aphis craccivora Koch. It could not successfully parasitize the <b>turnip</b> <b>aphid</b> Lipaphis pseudobrassicae Kalt or the black citrus aphid Toxoptera aurantii (Boyer de Fonscolombe). Field cage tests with P. nigronervosa and M. persicae also showed that A. transcaspicus successfully attacked both host species under semi-natural conditions, and preferred M. persicae over P. nigronervosa...|$|E
40|$|The {{biology of}} <b>turnip</b> <b>aphid</b> apterous (Lipaphis erysimi Kalt.) was studied in {{controlled}} conditions on four cultivars of Brassica viz. B. campestris (Toria-A), B. carinata (Peela raya), B. juncea (Bard- 1) and B. napus (Westar). Four nymphal instars were observed. The first stadium was the shortest on B. juncea and longest on B. campestris. Stadia for 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th instar ranged between 17 - 23, 20 - 24 and 29 - 31 hours, respectively. The reproductive {{time was the}} shortest on B. campestris and fecundity was at par with other cultivars of Brassica. The pre and post-reproductive times {{were not significantly different}} and ranged from 16 - 22 and 17 - 22 hours, respectively. The developmental time was approximately six days. The reproduction was significantly high on B. campestris and B. napus leading to higher intrinsic rate of increase on B. campestris than B. juncea and B. carinata...|$|E
40|$|Aphids in unsprayed canola (Brassica napus Linnaeus) {{fields in}} Isfahan {{province}} (central Iran) were sampled for two growing seasons, 2011 - 2013. Sampling unit {{was a whole}} plant and 20 plants were sampled weekly. In the laboratory, heat-extraction and sub-sampling techniques were used to estimate the density of aphids. To determine the relationship between population growth rate of the aphids and degree-days, linear regressions were done between log of aphid density and accumulated degree-days. Homogeneity tests were done using pairwise comparisons between slopes. Aphids' preference for upper (10 - 15 cm upper part of stem) and lower (the rest of stem) parts of the plant was analyzed using Student’s t-test. Aphid fauna included: Cabbage Aphid [CA; Brevicoryne brassicae (L.) ], Green Peach Aphid [GPA; Myzus persicae (Sulzer) ], and <b>Turnip</b> <b>Aphid</b> [TA; Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach) ]. The GPA developed small population in comparison with CA and TA and was occasionally found. The population density of CA and GPA tended to show two peaks, and during flower initiation, population began to decrease. The average population growth rates of GPA and CA were 0. 001 and 0. 003...|$|E
40|$|Methyl bromide (MB) as a {{fumigant}} for Quarantine and Pre-shipment (QPS) {{could offer}} eradication of target pests within shorter fumigation period and without phytotoxicity. Therefore, unlike MB alternatives for soil fumigation, {{there is no}} ideally MB alternative fumigant for QPS purpose, particularly for perishable commodities. It is critically important that within shorter fumigation time requires killing all target insect pests and without effect of quality and deliver treated fruit and vegetables to the final consumer. Aphids are pests frequently found in imported and exported fruit and vegetables. Aphids was known as quarantine pest hard to control when conduct short period fumigation with phosphine (PH 3) and low dose of ethyl formate (EF). Ethyl formate can lead to highly sorption and phytotoxic damage of some perishable commodities such as strawberries and cut flowers, especially at lower temperature (< 8 °C). Here, we reported that synergistic effect between ethyl formate and phosphine at lower dosages and temperature. The mixture of ethyl formate and phosphine had synergistic effect to control adult and nymph stages of tested cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii), green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) and <b>turnip</b> <b>aphid</b> (Lipaphis erysimi). When 0. 5 mg/L of PH 3 combined with different levels of EF at 5 and 20 °C for 2 hours fumigation, there was significantly {{difference in terms of}} LCT 50 % and LCT 90 % values in comparison with EF or PH 3 alone. This new technology could be meet QPS requirement that is shorter exposure time and less damage of perishable commodities...|$|E
40|$|Canola (Brassica napus L.) is {{the second}} most {{important}} source of vegetable oil after soybean. Its oil is widely used in cooking and for making salads and margarines, while the meal is commonly used in animal feeds all around the world. Pakistan, being an agricultural country, is still essentially deficient in edible oil production. It is estimated that more than three fourths of the country’s vegeTable oil requirements are met through imports. Canola is one potential crop which can fulfill the country’s requirement for edible oil. Insect pests are a major yield limiting factor of this crop. Among the insect pests, aphids are considered the major pest. Three aphid species are known to infest the canola crop, the cabbage aphid, Brevicoryne brassicae (L.), the <b>turnip</b> <b>aphid,</b> Lipaphis erysimi Kalt, and the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (all are Hemiptera: Aphididae). Heavy aphids attack on canola seedlings can cause wilting of the cotyledons and yellowing of the leaves. Heavy infestations of aphids on pods and flowers lead to yield reductions. Normally aphids cause about 30 - 35 % yield losses on brassica plants but under uncontrolled situations the yield losses may exceed 70 %. Control of the pest relies exclusively on pesticides. The indiscriminate use of pesticides has resulted in the development of resistance and resurgence by pests together with associated environmental and health hazards. This situation urgently demands alternate bio-intensive control measures as the main components of an IPM program. The present study was conducted on sustainable management of aphids on canola grown under organic and conventional farming systems in Punjab, Pakistan. The main objective {{of this study was to}} develop the most economical and effective management models by determining population distribution of aphids and their natural enemies, screening relatively tolerant crop genotypes, to identify sources of resistance, studying the biology of aphids and determining the efficacy of mechanical, biological and chemical practices for pest suppression. The results of these findings revealed that the cabbage aphids and mustard aphid were found in all four locations studied (Faisalabad, Bahawalpur, Khanpur and D. G. Khan) while the green peach aphid was recorded at two locations (Faisalabad and Khanpur). The genotypes ‘Cyclone’,‘Shiralee’ and Oscar were found to be susceptible with maximum population of aphids. The genotypes ‘Hyola- 401 ’ and ‘Rainbow’ were observed to be relatively resistant with lower populations of aphids. The results regarding the biochemical basis of resistance revealed that the availability of nitrogen increases susceptibility, and crop genotypes and farming systems with more nitrogen inputs suffered higher aphid populations. The different evaluated farming systems significantly affected the total life span of aphids, and maximum numbers of nymphs were produced on canola grown under fertilizer applications. All tested insecticides (Carbosulfan, Acetamaprid, Imidacloprid, Nitenpyram and Profenofos) were found to be effective against aphids and reduced population densities. Results revealed that treatments consisting of chrysoperla + coccinellid + blank water spray were highly effective against aphids on canola under both systems of farming. Predators performed well one week after release and their efficacy increased over time. A higher and noticeable yield was obtained under inorganic farming system where Chrysoperla carnea, coccinellids and blank water spray were integrated or blank water spray was applied. However, a higher CBR (10. 36 : 1) was attained under organic (farm yard manure application) where blank water spray was applied on the canola crop. Integration of C. carnea, coccinellids and blank water spray under organic farming system also produced a rationally higher CBR (4. 02 : 1). In conclusion, organic farming system (FYM application) with blank water spray or integration of C. carnea, coccinellids and blank water spray is better option and recommendation for aphid management in canola...|$|E
