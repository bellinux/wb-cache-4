An antibody that recognizes limited regions of amiloride and can mimic, in binding specificity, certain amiloride-sensitive <b>transport</b> <b>proteins</b> {{was used as}} a model to elucidate potential amino acid residue relationships that might define putative amiloride contact sites.

Computer models of sites within transmembrane domains of NHE 1 and NHE 2 isoforms of the Na+/H+ exchanger reflective of these planar tracts indicate that amiloride probably spans two helices for interaction with the Na+/H+ exchanger.

25|$|The {{hydrolysis}} of GM2-ganglioside requires three proteins. Two of {{them are}} subunits of hexosaminidasenbsp&A; the third is a small glycolipid <b>transport</b> <b>protein,</b> the GM2 activator protein (GM2A), which acts as a substrate-specific cofactor for the enzyme. Deficiency {{in any one of}} these proteins leads to ganglioside storage, primarily in the lysosomes of neurons. Tay–Sachs disease (along with AB-variant GM2-gangliosidosis and Sandhoff disease) occurs because a mutation inherited from both parents deactivates or inhibits this process. Most Tay–Sachs mutations probably do not directly affect protein functional elements (e.g., the active site). Instead, they cause incorrect folding (disrupting function) or disable intracellular transport.|$|E
25|$|The thick {{ascending}} limb of {{the loop}} of Henle begins at the deeper portion of the renal outer medulla. Here, the urine has a relatively high concentration of sodium. As urine moves towards the more superficial portion of the thick ascending limb, NKCC2 is the major <b>transport</b> <b>protein</b> by which sodium is reabsorbed from the urine. This outward movement of sodium {{and the lack of}} water permeability in the thick ascending limb, creates a more diluted urine. According to the stoichiometry outlined above, each molecule of sodium reabsorbed brings one molecule of potassium and two molecules of chloride. Sodium goes on to be reabsorbed into the blood, where it contributes to the maintenance of blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Copper is {{imported}} into cells through the cell wall by the plasma membrane <b>transport</b> <b>protein</b> known as Copper Transporter 1, or Ctr1. Ctr1 rapidly binds to intracellular copper chaperone proteins. Atox1 delivers copper to the secretory pathway and docks with either copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B {{in the liver}} or ATP7A in other cells. ATP7B directs copper to plasma ceruloplasmin or to biliary excretion in concert with a newly discovered chaperone, Murr1, the protein missing in canine copper toxicosis. ATP7A directs copper within the trans-Golgi network to the proteins dopamine beta-monooxygenase, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, lysyl oxidase, and tyrosinase, depending on the cell type. CCS is the copper chaperone for the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase that protects cells against reactive oxygen species; it delivers copper in the cytoplasm and intermitochondrial space. Cox17 delivers copper to mitochondria to cytochrome c oxidase via the chaperones Cox11, Sco1, and Sco2. Other copper chaperones may exist and might include metallothionein and amyloid precursor protein (APP). Genetic and nutritional studies have illustrated the essential nature of these copper-binding proteins.|$|E

25|$|LeuT {{has been}} co-crystallised with {{sertraline}} and (R)- and (S)-fluoxetine where the SSRIs {{have been found}} to bind as non-competitive inhibitors in a vestibule binding site (can be looked at as a second binding site), which is separated from the drugs binding site by the site chains of the two aromatic amino acids of the extracellular gate of the <b>transport</b> <b>protein.</b> The halogens on the SSRIs chemical structure all bind to the same HBP within LeuT and interact with similar amino acids, but the amino acid sequence in the HBP is highly preserved between LeuT and SERT. That suggest that in the human SERT the SSRIs also bind both at the same position and with similar manner, which is a key feature making the SSRIs selective for SERT. Conversely, there could be differences in their binding where {{the other part of the}} drug molecule will likely bind to SERT in a different way, given the diversity in their structure. The localisation of the vestibular binding site, as the primary SSRI binding site in SERT is, is however controversial since some research has shown that the SSRIs work in competitive manner by binding to the drugs binding site, not to the second binding site.|$|E

500|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{and phosphorus}} trifluoride are poisonous to humans because they bind to hemoglobin similarly to oxygen, but {{with much more}} strength, so that oxygen {{can no longer be}} transported throughout the body. Hemoglobin bound to carbon monoxide is known as carboxyhemoglobin. This effect also plays a minor role in the toxicity of cyanide, but there the major effect is by far its interference with the proper functioning of the electron <b>transport</b> <b>protein</b> cytochrome a. The cytochrome proteins also involve heme groups and are involved in the metabolic oxidation of glucose by oxygen. The sixth coordination site is then occupied by either another imidazole nitrogen or a methionine sulfur, so that these proteins are largely inert to oxygen – with the exception of cytochrome a, which bonds directly to oxygen and thus is very easily poisoned by cyanide. Here, the electron transfer takes place as the iron remains in low spin but changes between the +2 and +3 oxidation states. Since the reduction potential of each step is slightly greater than the previous one, the energy is released step-by-step and can thus be stored in adenosine triphosphate. Cytochrome a is slightly distinct, as it occurs at the mitochondrial membrane, binds directly to oxygen, and transports protons as well as electrons, as follows: ...|$|E

It is now established that a large proportion of these <b>transport</b> <b>proteins</b> can be grouped into families apparently conserved throughout organisms. This article presents the data of an in silicio analysis aimed at establishing a preliminary classification of membrane <b>transport</b> <b>proteins</b> in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This analysis was conducted at a time when about 65 % of all yeast genes were available in public databases. In addition to approximately 60 <b>transport</b> <b>proteins</b> whose function was at least partially known, approximately 100 deduced protein sequences of unknown function display significant sequence similarity to membrane <b>transport</b> <b>proteins</b> characterized in yeast and/or other organisms.
