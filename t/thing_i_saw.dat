500|$|Drake was {{accustomed}} to keeping his own hours; he frequently had difficulty sleeping and often stayed up through the night playing and listening to music, then slept late into the following morning. Recalling {{the events of the}} night, his mother later said: [...] "I never used to disturb him at all. But it was about 12 o'clock, and I went in, because really it seemed it was time he got up. And he was lying across the bed. The first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> was his long, long legs." [...] There was no suicide note, although a letter addressed to Ryde was found close to his bed.|$|E
500|$|Journalist James Hicks, {{who worked}} for the black news wire service, the National Negro Publishers Association (later renamed the National Newspaper Publishers Association), was present in the courtroom; he was {{especially}} impressed that Wright stood to identify Milam, pointing to him and saying [...] "There he is", calling it a historic moment and one filled with [...] "electricity". A writer for the New York Post noted that following his identification, Wright sat [...] "with a lurch which told better than anything else the cost in strength to him of the thing he had done." [...] A reporter who covered the trial for the New Orleans Times-Picayune said it was [...] "the most dramatic <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in my career".|$|E

2500|$|Chaviv Avrahami, who saw {{the scene}} of the attack after the bombing, recounted: [...] "I heard a {{tremendous}} explosion, and I was thrown up a metre into the air. I knew immediately that it was a bomb attack, and a catastrophic one. There were people - babies - thrown through the window and covered with blood. The whole street was covered with blood and bodies: the dead and the dying." [...] Naor Shara, a soldier who witnessed the attack, said, [...] "The worst <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw,</b> which I think will haunt me all my life, is a baby that was sitting in a stroller outside a shop and was dead. After the explosion, the baby's mother came out of the store and started screaming hysterically." ...|$|E
2500|$|SP4 Frederick J. Widmer – Assistant Radiotelephone Operator; Widmer, who {{has been}} the subject of pointed blame, is quoted as saying, [...] "The most {{disturbing}} <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> was one boy—and this was something that, you know, this is what haunts me from the whole, the whole ordeal down there. And there was a boy with his arm shot off, shot up half, half hanging on and he just had this bewildered look in his face and like, 'What did I do, what's wrong?' He was just, you know, it's, it's hard to describe, couldn't comprehend. I, I shot the boy, killed him and it's—I'd like to think of it more or less as a mercy killing because somebody else would have killed him in the end, but it wasn't right." [...] Widmer died on August 11, 2016 at the age of 68.|$|E
2500|$|Jemison flew {{her only}} space mission from September 12 to 20, 1992, as a Mission Specialist on STS-47, a {{cooperative}} mission between the United States and Japan, {{as well as}} the 50th shuttle mission. Jemison was a co-investigator of two bone cell research experiments, one of 43 investigations that were done on STS-47. Jemison also conducted experiments on weightlessness and motion sickness on herself and six other crew members. [...] "The first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> from space was Chicago, my hometown," [...] said Jemison. [...] "I was working on the middeck where there aren't many windows, and as we passed over Chicago, the commander called me up to the flight deck. It was such a significant moment because since I was a little girl I had always assumed I would go into space," [...] Jemison added. Despite NASA's rigid protocol, Jemison would begin each shift with a salute that only a Trekkie could appreciate. [...] "Hailing frequencies open," [...] she could be heard repeating throughout the eight-day mission.|$|E

[...] "As a child I dreamed awake, with my {{eyes open}} to the day, and when I spoke of the strange <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>I</b> was laughed at, and the other children were afraid and drew away from me. And when I spoke of the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> to Pow-Wah-Kaan, she chided me {{and said they were}} evil; also she beat me. It was a sickness, I believe, like the falling-sickness that comes to old men; and in time I grew better and dreamed no more. And now ... I cannot remember"--she brought her hand in a confused manner to her forehead--"they are there, somewhere, but I cannot find them, only ..." ...|$|R
60|$|So we sailed, and for {{six days}} passed down the {{wonderful}} river, making fast each night at some convenient spot. But when I {{lost sight of the}} familiar <b>things</b> that <b>I</b> had seen day by day since I had eyes to see, and found myself alone among strange faces, I felt very sore at heart, and would have wept had I not been ashamed. And of all the wonderful <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>I</b> will not write here, for, though they were new to me, have they not been known to men since such time as the Gods ruled in Egypt? But the priests who were with me showed me no little honour and expounded to me what were the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw.</b>|$|R
60|$|When next I awoke {{the first}} <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> was the round disc of a {{sympathetic}} eyeglass, behind which was Good.|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{yet there}} was one <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> clearly," [...] said I, [...] "and that was, that you exposed {{yourself}} and me to draw the soldiers." ...|$|E

60|$|But if I was extreamly {{delighted with}} the {{extraordinary}} <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in those Countries, you cannot but imagine I was exceedingly mov'd, when I heard of a Lunar World; and that the way was passable from these Parts.|$|R
60|$|The next <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> was the top-knot {{of silver}} hair surmounting Captain Ellis' smooth red face, {{which would have}} been apoplectic if it hadn't had such a fresh appearance.|$|E
6000|$|We {{arrived here}} this evening. I left the cars {{with my head}} full of the cathedral. The first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw,</b> on lifting my eyes, was a brown spire. Said I,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is the end}} of my account; and {{the most}} {{dangerous}} <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Waldron do was to go up on the bridge, on board the steamer, and talk there with the captain." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, Bob, so I {{hear you}} have been fighting, and {{commanding}} ships, and doing all sorts of <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Captain Lockett in the town and, faith, {{if you had been}} a dozen admirals, rolled into one, he couldn't have spoken more highly of you.|$|R
60|$|I protested my {{innocence of}} these <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{that under the}} mask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an {{insulated}} Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.|$|R
60|$|As I rose {{to my feet}} {{the first}} <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> was the {{malignant}} countenance of Issus glaring at me through the heavy bars of a grated door at {{one side of the}} chamber.|$|E

60|$|The last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> was the {{beautiful}} face of my Lady of the Shroud {{as she leaned}} {{over the edge of}} the opening. Her eyes were like glowing stars as her looks followed me. That look shall never fade from my memory.|$|E

2500|$|... "After the war I {{always knew}} that nothing, nothing, could ever be as bad ..... but nothing could frighten me any more, I mean, no man could frighten me any more, no Director ..... nothing could {{be as bad as}} the war, or the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in the war." ...|$|R
60|$|I woke {{with the}} {{consciousness}} of violent wordy warfare carried on around me.

60|$|We bade adieu to Mrs. Steerforth and Miss Dartle, {{with many}} thanks on my part, and much {{kindness}} on the devoted mother's. The last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> was Littimer's unruffled eye; fraught, as I fancied, with the silent conviction that I {{was very young}} indeed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, one <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{no women}} in their camp, nor any sign of children. This I know because I gave orders that such were to be spared and it was {{reported}} {{to me that there}} were none, so I supposed that they had fled away." ...|$|E
6000|$|And in {{the midst}} of our desolateness, just as we had let the {{daylight}} in again upon our diminished numbers round the table, came a letter from Hong-Kong, addressed to me in Lawrence Frith's writing, and the first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> was a scrawl, as follows:- ...|$|E

60|$|For {{know that}} I {{remember}} only the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> myself, {{with my own}} eyes, in those prehistoric days. If my mother knew my father's end, she never told me.
