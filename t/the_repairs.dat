5|$|In March 2013, Nvidia {{launched}} the GTX Titan, a consumer graphics card {{that uses the}} same GPU die as the K20X GPUs in Titan. Titan underwent acceptance testing in early 2013 but only completed 92% of the tests, short of the required 95%. The problem was discovered to be excess gold in the female edge connectors of the motherboards' PCIe slots causing cracks in the motherboards' solder. The cost of repair was borne by Cray and between 12 and 16 cabinets were repaired each week. Throughout <b>the</b> <b>repairs</b> users were given access to the available CPUs. On March 11, they gained access to 8,972 GPUs. ORNL announced on April 8 that <b>the</b> <b>repairs</b> were complete and acceptance test completion was announced on June 11, 2013.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Auto repair is {{a process}} which solves the problem iteratively and constantly. It is {{required}} to establish the knowledge base model and the inference base model. Meanwhile, it develops <b>the</b> knowledge-based auto <b>repair</b> diagnostic system through the integration of <b>the</b> auto <b>repair</b> experience and <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> process. Afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> time can be effectively shortened and <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> complexity can be reduced. Finally, <b>the</b> rapid <b>repair</b> and <b>the</b> efficient service will be achieved. Keywords-knowledge management; Expert system; artificial Intelligence; repair diagnostic syste...|$|R

40|$|After Escherichia coli {{was injured}} by freezing, <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> process was studied during {{incubation}} {{of the cells}} for 2 hr at 25 C in 0. 5 % K 2 HPO 4 at pH 7. 0 {{in the presence of}} specific metabolic inhibitors. <b>The</b> <b>repair</b> in K 2 HPO 4 was not affected by inhibitors of the synthesis of protein, nucleic acids, and mucopeptide. These inhibitors prevented growth of <b>the</b> <b>repaired</b> cells in a minimal broth at 35 C for 24 hr (except actinomycin D and hydroxyurea). Several uncouplers of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis reduced <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> process in K 2 HPO 4, but only cyanide and azide prevented growth in minimal medium. Data indicated that the cells synthesized energy in the form of ATP and probably utilized it for <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> process. Addition of ATP also facilitated <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> of injury. <b>The</b> freeze-injured cells showed extreme susceptibility to surface-active agents and lysozyme. <b>The</b> <b>repaired</b> cells, like <b>the</b> uninjured cells, became relatively resistant to these compounds...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>repairs</b> mainly {{involved}} {{fixing holes}} in the roof and preventing the ingress of rain water, as well as repairing the weatherboards on the sides. The intervention by English Heritage led to a protracted dispute over the £30,000 cost of <b>the</b> <b>repairs</b> that was scheduled to come to trial at the High Court of Justice in April 2012. In January 2012, a settlement was reached in which Harmondsworth Barn Ltd sold the barn to English Heritage for £20,000. By that time the government had abandoned its plans to expand Heathrow Airport and the barn had become a liability for the company.|$|E

50|$|Repair trades can be {{specified}} for <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> of any element, {{and they}} represent manpower {{in the form of}} a set of skilled maintenance workers with a particular trade.

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the Lowestoft raid, Admiral Reinhard Scheer began planning another foray into the North Sea.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedComposite structure repair methodology {{has been developed}} to specific applications (typically in small area and limited to secondary structure) and is being extended to Large Area Composite Structure Repair (with target extension to primary structures). Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> becomes more critical because we get redistribution of stresses that can also affect the zones outside of <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> area. For this reason, an analytic evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>repair's</b> reliability has to be performed to define a parameter which reflects {{on the effectiveness of}} <b>the</b> <b>repair.</b> In this work, we establish a principal guideline to evaluate the redundancy and compare the reliability of <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> to <b>the</b> reliability of the parent structure (i. e., the structure in the undamaged state). The approach adopted is to utilize structural finite element analysis to compute the state and of <b>the</b> candidate <b>repaired</b> state. <b>The</b> reliability of these two spatially non-uniform stresses is computed by a probabilistic failure criterion. Thus, we can optimize <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> configuration by varying the strength and the stiffness of any element in <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> site by varying the lamination angles, and selectively using hybrid materials.

30|$|Comparison of <b>the</b> <b>repaired</b> column {{performances}} {{in this study}} is complicated by the different damage conditions of the corresponding original columns and <b>the</b> different <b>repair</b> profiles.

40|$|In {{concrete}} repair systems, {{material properties}} in <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> material and interface are {{greatly influenced by}} the initial moisture content of the concrete (or mortar) substrate. In order to quantify moisture profiles inside <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> system, X-ray absorption was used. Preliminary studies are performed first to determine the absorption rate of a two-year-old mortar substrate. Cumulative water absorption and the penetration front of water are monitored {{as a function of}} time. Furthermore, absorption by the mortar substrate is investigated when a repair material is cast on top. Influence of water-to-cement ratio (w/c) of <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> material on water exchange, and moisture content change during drying in <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> system are studied. Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) paste was used as a repair material. It was shown that, initially, water from <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> material is absorbed by the substrate with the same speed as “free” water. Furthermore, not only can water be absorbed by the substrate, but it can also migrate back from the substrate to <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> material due to hydration of <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> material. Quantifying <b>the</b> dynamics of water exchange at an early stage between <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> material and <b>the</b> concrete substrate is a first step towards understanding the development of material and interface properties in repair systems.

In a controversial move in 2011, Governor Chris Christie directed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) to divert money originally earmarked for the Access to the Region's Core rail project to highway projects.
