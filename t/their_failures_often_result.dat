To determine the functional role of PGC- 1 α in oxidative phenotype–associated protection, skeletal muscle–specific PGC- 1 α transgenic mice were crossbred with cardiac-specific calsequestrin transgenic mice, a genetic model of chronic heart failure. PGC- 1 α overexpression in glycolytic muscles significantly attenuated catabolic muscle wasting induced by chronic heart failure. In addition to inactivation of forkhead transcription factor signaling through enhanced Akt/protein kinase B expression, in glycolytic muscles, PGC- 1 α overexpression led to enhanced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, production of nitric oxide, and expression of antioxidant enzyme including superoxide dismutases (SOD 1, SOD 2, and SOD 3) and catalase, and reduced oxidative stress.

40|$|Low-frequency {{projectors}} for {{underwater sound}} are often driven near stress limits {{because of the}} conflicting requirements of high power and small size. One common failure mode is ceramic cracking and the associated arcing between high-voltage electrodes. While {{there are a number}} of manufacturing defects that can cause premature electric breakdown or premature cracking, a fundamental problem results from the coupling between the electric field and stress in a piezoelectric material. For a transducer operated near resonance, there will be "hot spots " or regions of locally intense stress and electric field that precipitate premature failure. The long-term goals of this project are: (1) to develop a capability to describe such failure modes, (2) to understand the factors that precede failure, and (3) to develop guidelines for failure mitigation. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In analyzing failure of high-power transducers it is essential to distinguish between fundamental limits and limits introduced by design departures from ideal conditions. The results of an examination of piezoelectric survivability under near ideal conditions show that the material can withstand considerably higher stress (both electrical and mechanical) than the usual guidelines for design suggest.

40|$|AbstractNormal animal {{development}} requires accurate cell divisions, {{not only}} {{in the early stages of}} rapid embryonic cleavages, but also in later developmental stages. The Caenorhabditis elegans unc- 85 gene is implicated only in cell divisions that occur post-embryonically, primarily in terminal neuronal lineages. Variable post-embryonic cell division failures in ventral cord motoneuron precursors result in uncoordinated locomotion of unc- 85 mutant larvae by the second larval stage. These neuroblast cell division <b>failures</b> <b>often</b> <b>result</b> in unequally sized daughter nuclei, and sometimes in nuclear fusions. Using a combination of conventional mapping techniques and microarray analysis, we cloned the unc- 85 gene, and find that it encodes one of two C. elegans homologs of the yeast Anti-silencing function 1 (Asf 1) histone chaperone. The unc- 85 gene is expressed in replicating cells throughout development, and the protein is localized in nuclei. Examination of null mutants confirms that embryonic neuroblast cell divisions occur normally, but post-embryonic neuroblast cell divisions fail. Analysis of the DNA content of the mutant neurons indicates that defective replication in post-embryonic neuroblasts gives rise to ventral cord neurons with an average DNA content of approximately 2. 5  n. We conclude that UNC- 85 functions in post-embryonic DNA replication in ventral cord motor neuron precursors...|$|R
40|$|Complete loss of platelet-derived {{growth factor}} (PDGF) {{receptor}} signaling results in embryonic lethality around embryonic day 9. 5, but {{the cause of}} this lethality has not been identified. Because cardiovascular <b>failure</b> <b>often</b> <b>results</b> in embryonic lethality at this time point, we hypothesized that a failure in cardiovascular development could be the cause. To assess the combined role of PDGF receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha) and PDGFRbeta, we generated embryos that lacked these receptors in cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) using conditional gene ablation. Deletion of either PDGFRalpha or PDGFRbeta caused no overt vascular defects, but loss of both receptors using an SM 22 alpha-Cre transgenic mouse line led to a disruption in yolk sac blood vessel development. The cell population responsible for this vascular defect was the yolk sac mesothelial cells, not the cardiomyocytes or the VSMC. Coincident with loss of PDGF receptor signaling, we found a reduction in collagen deposition and an increase in MMP- 2 activity. Finally, in vitro allantois cultures demonstrated a requirement for PDGF signaling in vessel growth. Together, these data demonstrate that PDGF receptors cooperate in the yolk sac mesothelium to direct blood vessel maturation and suggest that these effects are independent of their role in VSMC developmen...|$|R
40|$|Weaning from {{mechanical}} ventilation remains {{a major challenge}} for critical care physicians. Because subjective criteria are inaccurate, objective measurements consisting of clinical criteria and physiologic tests (weaning predictors) {{have been used to}} facilitate decision-making. An integrated weaning index calculated as the product of static compliance and arterial oxygen saturation divided by the frequency–tidal volume ratio appears to be more accurate than other currently available predictors. Despite the accuracy of this new test, a beneficial effect on outcome is yet to be proven. Invasive {{mechanical ventilation}} provides support during recovery from acute respiratory failure but results in complications, and longer duration of intubation is associated with increased mortality. Patients should therefore be weaned and extubated as soon as it is safe to do so. Objective physiologic measurements (weaning predictors) are often used as surrogate markers of recovery [1]. Unfortunately, an evidence-based review identified relatively few predictors associated with clinically significant changes in the probability of weaning success or failure [2]. Of the predictors studied, the respiratory frequency to tidal volume ratio (f/V T) appears to be most accurate [3]. Because weaning <b>failure</b> <b>often</b> <b>results</b> from a complex interplay of factors, a more comprehensive integrative index may prove superior.

In addition, synchronization between the interventions of the different members in a perinatal team is complex. It is therefore necessary to train both individuals and teams to better manage perinatal crisis situations. The educational approach should remain multimodal, combining teaching of technical and non-techniques skills. Simulation of resuscitation scenarios can mimic emergency situations without any risk to the patient. It can be used for teaching and/or evaluation of the effectiveness of procedures and collaboration between actors. For maximum performance in complex pathologies, multidisciplinary teaching sessions are necessary.

Zinc is abundantly available, benign, inexpensive, stable {{over a wide}} operating temperature range, and has a high oxidation potential. In spite of these advantageous characteristics, rechargeable electrochemical systems based on zinc chemistry have not found widespread use. The major disadvantages of zinc electrodes are that they have limited cycle life due to zinc slumping and zinc electrode shape changes in alkaline solutions resulting from the solubility of zincate (Zn(OH) {sub 4 }{sup 2 -}) in these solutions. As a <b>result,</b> premature cell <b>failure</b> <b>often</b> <b>results</b> due to cell shorting caused by dendritic growth as well as zinc slumping.

The alkali metal salts of the acid possess good thermal stability, good ionic conductivity, and have a wide electrochemical voltage window in aqueous systems. With these electrolyte solutions improved cycle life was achieved in Zn/NiOOH and Zn/AgO. Improved cycle life with this additive is attributed to decreased zincate solubility, resulting in reduced zinc slumping and electrode shape changes. In addition, increased shelf-life and reduced self-discharge were also observed in many alkaline power sources...|$|R

Experimental work on insight problem solving is used to examine how external artifacts can be used to reach the goal of assembling a 'cheap necklace'. Instead of asking how insight occurs 'in the head', our participants in Experiment 1 can either draw solution attempts or manipulate real objects (specifically, chain links that make up a necklace). Even though performance with real chain links is significantly more successful than on paper, access to objects does not make this insight problem simple: objects themselves do not shape cognition.

By investigating how objects are used, we show that they do more than supplement neural events. Rather, participants monitor and anticipate the effects of action (and thinking) within an organism-environment system.

A 77 -year-old female developed de novo hepatitis B after R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolated from the patient was of genotype Bj, with a precore mutation (G 1896 A) exhibiting an extremely high viral load at the onset of hepatitis. She showed markedly high levels of transaminase with mild jaundice on admission and rapid decrease of prothrombin activity after admission. Although acute liver failure was averted by the administration of entecavir and corticosteroid pulse therapy, liver volume decreased to 860 ml, and marked hypoalbuminemia accompanying massive ascites occurred 2 months after the onset of hepatitis and persisted for 3 months with high levels of HBV DNA and mild abnormal alanine aminotransferase levels. Frequent infusions of albumin solution, nutrition support, and alleviation therapy showed limited effect. However, overall improvement along with HBV DNA reduction was observed after increasing the dose of entecavir and completion of prednisolone that was administered with a minimum dose for adrenal insufficiency.

40|$|Introduction: First-line {{antiretroviral}} therapy (ART) <b>failure</b> <b>often</b> <b>results</b> {{from the}} development of resistance-associated mutations (RAMs). Three patterns, including thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs), 69 Insertion (69 Ins) and the Q 151 M complex, are associated with resistance to multiple-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and may compromise treatment options for second-line ART. Methods: We investigated patterns and factors associated with multi-NRTI RAMs at first-line failure in patients from The TREAT Asia Studies to Evaluate Resistance – Monitoring study (TASER-M), and evaluated their impact on virological responses at 12 months after switching to second-line ART. RAMs were compared with the IAS-USA 2013 mutations list. We defined multi-NRTI RAMs {{as the presence of}} either Q 151 M; 69 Ins; ≥ 2 TAMs; or M 184 V+≥ 1 TAM. Virological suppression was defined as viral load (VL) 2 years (OR= 6. 25, 95 % CI [2. 39 – 16. 36], p< 0. 001). Among 87 / 105 patients with available VL at 12 months after switch to second-line ART, virological suppression was achieved in 85 %. The median genotypic susceptibility score (GSS) for the second-line regimen was 2. 00. Patients with ART adherence ≥ 95 % {{were more likely to be}} virologically suppressed (OR= 9. 33, 95 % CI (2. 43 – 35. 81), p= 0. 001). Measures of patient resistance to second-line ART, including the GSS, were not significantly associated with virological outcome. Conclusions: Multi-NRTI RAMs at first-line failure were associated with low CD 4 level and longer duration of ART. With many patients switching to highly susceptible regimens, good adherence was still crucial in achieving virological response. This emphasizes the importance of continued adherence counselling well into second-line therapy...|$|R
