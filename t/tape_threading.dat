The history of our collaboration began with the Gunfighter Project, collaborative discussions evolved around sound, music, projection, film, dance/performance, sculpture and printed image; through this, the potential for pattern could be explored along with the use of digital media. “From a practical point of view using digital media and printing enabled us to derive narrative images from a number of sources and work with them to create 3 d anaglyphs that could be printed onto fabric. This gave us the possibility to make wearable sculptures and forms that opened up performance possibilities. This then gave us the chance to create more imagery by collaborating with Genetic Moo, Collectress, Circo Rumbaba and musicians. ” Evelyn Bennett “The use of digital media has enabled an analogue practitioner such as myself to explore quick ways of notating sound and music to explore the musical motif as a repeat to create pattern. These weave themselves into layered soundscapes that are reminiscent of ambient surroundings, where you might see pattern, for example in nature or interiors” Rebecca Waterworth “In the Making; Lightdial” was part funded by UCA to develop costumes designed and made by Rutter and Bennett. The collaboration explored pattern, motif and the notion of repeat, through dance, music, performance, sound, and printed pattern. Working digitally enabled the transposition of ideas from one media to another, text to sound, sound to image, image to sculpture, image to performance. The instant nature of digital media enabled pattern to be derived within these medias, whether through filming movement to repeat and rehearse or using sounds made through movement to loop as a motif, these methods allowed for a surprisingly organic growth which influenced the development of the textile design and costumes. In presenting our collaboration through a presentation, film and live performance we feel we demonstrate how digital technologies impacts on the potential of digital textiles and the potential of new materials such as conductive <b>tape</b> and <b>thread</b> in” allowing” for the inclusion of other medias to be incorporated in to the nature of what “surface” is. In the “Bauhaus like” collaboration there became an inclusivity not exclusivity into how each practitioner operated a designer became sound maker or a musician became dancer and that was through not only the digital media but the notion of pattern. And this throws up some truly interesting notions of what pattern can incorporate and therefore the potential of textile design to incorporate a broader context when considering its future potential...|$|R
40|$|Actually, the Coriolis {{acceleration}} component {{experienced by}} axi-Downmagnetic tapes, paper sheets, textile fibers, band saws, aerial cable tramways, and crane hoist cables. Despite many advantages of these devices, noise and vibrations, particularly transverse vibra-tions, {{associated with the}} devices have limited their applications. For example, in magnetic tape drives, the vibration of a tape leads to signal modulation and accelerates the wear of the tape; in band saws, the vibration of a blade results in poor cutting quality. Therefore, understanding transverse vibrations of axially moving strings {{is important for the}} design of the devices. Furthermore, for high precision applications, it is desirable to introduce suitable control mechanisms to reduce vibrations of axially moving strings in order to improve performance of the devices. A string is a one-dimensional continuum that offers no resis-tance to bending. Since the gravitational force is sufficiently small compared with the tension force, the equilibrium configuration is a straight line. Many slender engineering elements such as belts, cables, strips, chains, <b>tapes,</b> ropes, and <b>thread</b> lines can be mod-eled as strings because their bending stiffness is relatively small. If slender engineering elements have rather large bending stiff-ness, they will be treated as moving beams. Slender engineering elements with curved equilibrium configurations will be treated as moving cables ~loose strings!. As for engineering elements that have considerable width, two-dimensional continuum models such as membranes, plates or shells should be used. The investigations on transverse vibrations and control of axi-ally moving strings have theoretical significance, because an axi-ally moving string is a simplest representative of distributed gy-roscopic systems. Axially moving strings, beams, cables, membranes, and plates all fall into the class of axially moving ally moving materials imparts a skew-symmetric or gyroscopic term to their governing equations. Due to particular characteristics of the gyroscopic term, the approaches developed in analysis and control of transverse vibrations of an axially moving string can be applied to other more complicated distributed gyroscopic systems. The relevant researches on transverse vibrations of axially mov-ing strings can be dated back to Skutc...|$|R

I recollect to have seen that fact very fully established, last year, from the registers kept in the West Riding of Yorkshire. This year, in the West of England, I received a similar account, on the authority of a respectable clothier in that quarter, whose testimony can less be questioned, because, in his political opinions, he is adverse, as I understand, to the continuance of the war. The principal articles of female dress for some time past have been muslins and calicoes.[44] These elegant fabrics of our own looms in the East, which serve for the remittance of our own revenues, have lately been imitated at home, with improving success, by the ingenious and enterprising manufacturers of Manchester, Paisley, and Glasgow. At the same time the importation from Bengal has kept pace with the extension of our own dexterity and industry; while the sale of our printed goods,[45] of both kinds, has been with equal steadiness advanced by the taste and execution of our designers and artists. Our woollens and cottons, it is true, are not all for the home market. They do not distinctly prove, what is my present point, our own wealth by our own expense. I admit it: we export them in great and growing quantities: and they who croak themselves hoarse about the decay of our trade may put as much of this account as they choose to the creditor side of money received from other countries in payment for British skill and labor. They may settle the items to their own liking, where all goes to demonstrate our riches. I shall be contented here with whatever they will have the goodness to leave me, and pass to another entry, which is less ambiguous,--I mean that of silk.[46] The manufactory itself is a forced plant. We have been obliged to guard it from foreign competition by very strict prohibitory laws. What we import is the raw and prepared material, which is worked up in various ways, and worn in various shapes by both sexes. After what we have just seen, you will probably {{be surprised to learn that}} the quantity of silk imported during the war has been much greater than it was previously in peace; and yet we must all remember, to our mortification, that several of our silk ships fell a prey to Citizen Admiral Richery. You will hardly expect me to go through the <b>tape</b> and <b>thread,</b> and all the other small wares of haberdashery and millinery to be gleaned up among our imports. But I shall make one observation, and with great satisfaction, respecting them. They gradually diminish, as our own manufactures of the same description spread into their places; while the account of ornamental articles which our country does not produce, and we cannot wish it to produce, continues, upon the whole, to rise, in spite of all the caprices of fancy and fashion. Of this kind are the different furs[47] used for muffs, trimmings, and linings, which, as the chief of the kind, I shall particularize. You will find them below.|$|R
