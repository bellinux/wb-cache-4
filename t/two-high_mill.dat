40|$|Purpose: One of {{the reasons}} behind the {{interest}} in copper titanium alloys was development of new materials to substitute copper beryllium alloys. The reason for selecting that material for studies {{was that in the}} early stages of decomposition of CuTi 4 alloy a spinodal transformation takes place and ordering processes begin. Proper selection of heat treatment and plastic working conditions provides possibilities to produce very wide range of sets of properties by formation of the required alloy microstructure. Therefore the main objective of the study was to capture the changes in precipitation kinetics, especially in the relations between supersaturation and ageing or between supersaturaion, cold deformation and ageing in connection to the changes in microstructure and functional properties (mainly changes in hardness and electrical conductivity). Design/methodology/approach: Melting of the charge material was conducted in medium-frequency induction furnace, in a graphite crucible. The melted material after bath preparation was poured into a cast iron ingot mould (with graphite grease applied on the inside) of dimensions 35 x 120 x 250 mm. The ingots after casting were peeled. The treated ingots were heated in resistance furnace at 900 ÂºC for 1. 5 hour and rolled down on a reversible <b>two-high</b> <b>mill.</b> Findings: Decomposition of supersaturated solid solution in that alloy is similar to the alloys produced in laboratory scale. The observed differences in microstructure after supersaturation were related to the presence of undissolved Ti particles and increased segregation of titanium distribution in copper matrix including microareas of individual grains. The mentioned factors influence the mechanism and kinetics of precipitation and subsequently the produced wide ranges of functional properties of the alloy. Research limitations/implications: Cold deformation (50 % reduction) of the alloy after supersaturation changes the mechanism and kinetics of precipitation and provides possibilities for production of broader sets of functional properties. It is expected that widening of the cold deformation range should result in more complete characteristics of material properties, suitable for the foreseen applications. Similar effects can be expected after application of cold deformation after ageing. Practical implications: The elaborated research results present some utilitarian qualities since they can be used in development of process conditions for industrial scale production of strips from CuTi 4 alloy of defined properties and operating qualities. Originality/value: The mentioned factors influence the mechanism and kinetics of precipitation and subsequently the produced wide ranges of functional properties of the Cu-Ti alloys...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} types of flat bars (P 100 x 40 and P 80 x 5) have been selected for the computer simulation. It has been performed with the FormFEM programme {{and then with the}} ITA company-produced TT-steel software package. The bars were continuously rolled in <b>two-high</b> <b>mills,</b> which typically had the H-V arrangement. The bars were rolled of common structural steel stock. Mathematical computation of kinetics of static and dynamic recrystallization have been conducted independently of the computer simulation. Furthermore, calculation of grain size was performed. The heat transfer was studied theoretically. Results of the study have been compared with renowned laboratory experiments and the heat transfer curve was selected according to contact time, temperature and flow stress of the material. This software package has been used for simulation of heat temperature upon rolling with support of the TTSteel programme. The results comprised volume fractions of ferrite, austenite, pearlite, bainite and martensite in the microstructure and mechanical properties (yield strength, ultimate strength and hardness) upon heat treatment. The resulting values indicate that homogeneous structure is formed...|$|R

[...] The strip is then sintered and subjected to another rolling and further sintering. Rolling is commonly used to produce sheet metal for electrical and electronic components, as well as coins.

50|$|Mills are {{designed}} {{in different types}} of configurations, with the most basic being a two-high non-reversing, which means there are two rolls that only turn in one direction. The <b>two-high</b> reversing <b>mill</b> has rolls that can rotate in both directions, but the disadvantage is that the rolls must be stopped, reversed, and then brought back up to rolling speed between each pass. To resolve this, the three-high mill was invented, which uses three rolls that rotate in one direction; the metal is fed through two of the rolls and then returned through the other pair. The disadvantage to this system is the workpiece must be lifted and lowered using an elevator. All of these mills are usually used for primary rolling and the roll diameters range from 60 to 140 cm.|$|R
40|$|As a {{basis for}} {{extended}} studies into the evolution, structure and corrosion properties of the subsurface layers in hot rolled aluminium alloys, {{the evolution of the}} subsurface layers in industrially rolled AA 3104 transfer bar has been simulated in a laboratory mill. Test samples taken from the centre of industrially rolled AA 3104 transfer bar were highly polished, reheated and homogenised under carefully determined conditions and rolled in the <b>two-high</b> Robertson <b>mill</b> at the University of Sheffield. The stock surfaces and subsurface layers in industrially rolled and laboratory rolled material were then characterised using a combination of optical microscopy, quantification of stock surface morphology, glow discharge optical emission spectrometry (GDOES), focussed ion beam (FIB) microscopy and filiform corrosion testing. The results from the experimental programme have demonstrated that the near-surface metallic element distributions, the microstructures and depths of the subsurface layers and the filiform corrosion susceptibility of the rolled surfaces in the industrially rolled and laboratory rolled materials were all very similar. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Simulations of the {{reheating}} and {{breakdown rolling}} of the Al-Mg-Mn aluminium alloy AA 3104 carried out using a <b>two-high</b> laboratory <b>mill</b> {{were supported by}} detailed numerical modelling of the stock surface layer formation. The model of the stock/roll interface is usually a micro-part of a more complex macro-finite-element model. Corresponding linking of modelling scales is a necessary stage for numerical analysis of fine mechanisms of the interface formation. This procedure allows for consideration of the fine mechanisms responsible for formation of the scale/metal interface while, at the same time, {{reducing the number of}} elements under consideration. It has been shown that a small amount of Mg (as oxides) was intermixed into the subsurface layer of a few microns depth by deformation during rolling. The mechanisms which led to the deformation and mixing of the oxide particles into the subsurface layer arose from slip at the roll/stock interface and the action of roll surface asperities on the stock surface.

40|$|High {{speed steel}} rolls have prevailed in hot rolling mills {{due to their}} {{excellent}} wear resistance, high hardness and oxidation resistance. The thermal cycling ol the rolls causes the surface oxidation, which significantly changes the contact and tribological behaviour between work roll and hot rolled material. In the paper, the formation and growth ol oxide scale ol a high speed steel roll material were in- situ investigated by a High Temperature Microscope. In- situ observations indicate that the oxide scales of the high speed steel first nucleate at the carbides/matrix interfaces, and then rapidly spread to cover the carbides and followed by continuous growth over the whole surface. The selective oxidation of high speed steel has {{a significant impact on}} the roll surface morphology. Water vapour in oxidizing atmosphere increases the oxidation rates of carbides and the matrix. The <b>two-high</b> mini <b>mill</b> coupled with the Gleeble 3500 thermo- mechanical simulator was used to measure the tribological contact behaviour between high speed steel work roll and mild steel strip sample under the stalled hot rolling conditions. The experimental results show that fresh ground and pre- oxidized roll surfaces exhibit quite different ways of tribological behaviours. The rolling force of pre-oxidized rolls is always higher than that of fresh ground rolls whatever in different reductions, or temperatures. The surface conditions of work roll have a decisive effect on the strip roughness...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the work}} is a semi-industrial {{physical}} simulation of thermomechanical rolling and controlled cooling of advanced high-strength steels with increased Mn and Al content. Design/methodology/approach: Four steels of various Mn and Nb concentration were thermomechanically rolled in 3 and 5 passes using a modern LPS line for physical simulation of hot rolling at a semi-industrial scale. The hot deformation course is fully automated as well as controlled cooling applied directly after finishing rolling. Temperature-time and force-energetic parameters of hot rolling were continuously registered and assessed. Findings: The applied line consisting of <b>two-high</b> reversing <b>mill,</b> roller tables with heating panels, cooling devices and controlling-recording systems reflects industrial hot strip rolling parameters sufficiently. Reduction values and temperature-time regimes are similar to those used in industrial practice whereas strain rate is limited to about 10 s- 1 what requires taking into account during comparison. All the steels investigated have high total pressure forces due to the high total content of alloying elements. The critical factor making it possible to obtain high-quality sheet samples with a thickness up to 3. 3 mm is applying isothermal heating panels which decrease a cooling rate of thin sheets. Research limitations/implications: The real complete simulation of hot strip rolling requires extension of a used line with a further module for simulation of continuous finishing rolling stages. The work is in progress. Practical implications: The results can be successfully utilized in industrial hot rolling and controlled cooling practices after necessary modifications. Originality/value: The efficient semi-industrial physical simulation of hot strip thermomechanical rolling of some new model AHSS grades containing increased Mn and Al content as well as Nb microadditions was presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{model of}} the stock/roll {{interface}} during rolling is usually a micro-part of a more complex macro-finite-element model. Corresponding linking of modelling scales is a necessary stage for numerical analysis of fine mechanisms of the interface formation. These, for example, can include behaviour of thin oxide scales and formation of a few micron thick stock surface layers during hot rolling. The micro scale model {{has the capacity to}} include very fine features of the interface such as roll asperities, multi-layer scales, voids or a complicated profile of the scale/metal interface. Simulations of the reheating and breakdown rolling of the Al-Mg-Mn aluminium alloy AA 3104 carried out at the University of Sheffield using a <b>two-high</b> laboratory <b>mill</b> were supported by detailed numerical modelling of the stock surface layer formation. To link âmacro-â and âmicro-â scales of the modelling, the micro-model was reduced to a small segment of the stock-roll interface. The boundary conditions for the small segment were taken from the macro-model. The FE mesh near the interface was then refined as required; the origin of coordinates was changed by tying it to one of the segment nodes and, finally, asperities and grinding defects on the roll surface were introduced onto the roll surface. This procedure allowed for consideration of the fine mechanisms responsible for formation of the scale/metal interface while, at the same time, reducing the number of elements under consideration. Examination of the specimens using glow discharge optical emission spectrometry revealed that the reheating induced significant Mg enrichment in the surface and near surface regions and that Mg diffusion and oxidation continued throughout the reheating. The results of the experimental examinations obtained for the laboratory samples indicated that the level of Mg in the near surface regions of the rolled specimen was of an order of magnitude less than that observed in the reheated specimens. Further analysis including the multi-scale numerical modelling indicated that, under the rolling conditions used, the fall in Mg content arose mainly due to the removal of some of the thin oxide layer by abrasion and adhesion to the work roll surface. In addition a small amount of Mg (as oxides) was intermixed into the subsurface layer of a few microns depth by deformation during rolling. It is thought that the mechanisms which led to the deformation and mixing of the oxide particles into the subsurface layer arose from slip at the roll/stock interface and the action of roll surface asperities on the stock surface...|$|R
