5|$|At Mulder's apartment, Scully {{announces that}} because of Mulder's odd behavior, she {{realized}} Mulder's body contains Morris Fletcher. Scully demands {{to know how to}} restore Mulder to his own body. Mulder's informant calls again and Scully forces Fletcher to take the call and set up a meeting. Mulder, Joanne, Fletcher and Scully arrive at a bar in Rachel, Nevada, where Mulder's informant is revealed to be General Wegman. Wegman admits that he sabotaged the UFO, but maintains that he only tried to merely disable the stealth module so that Mulder could see it. Wegman gives Fletcher, who he thinks is Mulder, the proof of the encounter, a flight data recorder in a paper bag. Meanwhile, Mulder leaves and talks to Scully in the car. Later, Mulder and Fletcher meet in the bar's bathroom and argue about the flight data recorder. As they argue, General Wegman enters the bathroom and discovers the two. Mulder meets with General Wegman to discuss the UFO. Wegman believes <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> Fletcher knows Wegman's identity, when restored to his own body, Fletcher will turn him in. Wegman explains that he hoped that Mulder could explain whether aliens actually exist; apparently the craft are simply given to the military without knowing where they are from or how they work.|$|E
25|$|Germany {{requested}} that Sweden provide {{use of the}} railway network to transport military equipment, but the Swedish government agreed only to transitering av human karaktär, men ej underhåll till stridande trupp (transit of humanitarian character, but no supply of fighting soldiers). Germany argued <b>that,</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> Norway was occupied, the German soldiers there were no longer fighting, and thus transported {{a large amount of}} military equipment, ammunition and, secretly, troops from southern to northern Norway, via Malmbanan and Kiruna. Troops were often transported in transports declared as material transports. Despite being strictly against the rules, there was considerable interaction between the German soldiers and the Swedish locals, including trading and football matches.|$|E

He tricks his father with a forged letter, making him think that Edgar plans to usurp the estate. Kent returns from exile in disguise (calling himself Caius), and Lear hires him as a servant. At Albany and Goneril's house, Lear and Kent quarrel with Oswald, Goneril's steward. Lear discovers <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> Goneril has power, she no longer respects him. She orders him {{to reduce the number}} of his disorderly retinue. Enraged, Lear departs for Regan's home. The Fool reproaches Lear with his foolishness in giving everything to Regan and Goneril, and predicts that Regan will treat him no better.|$|E

25|$|Engel and {{the other}} {{producers}} {{did not want to}} lose Berkley, however, as she was the strongest actress they'd seen during casting. Berkley originally auditioned for the role of Karen, a love-interest of Zack's on Good Morning, Miss Bliss, but lost the role because she was so much taller than Gosselaar at the time. Engel believed <b>that,</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> her height was more even {{with the rest of the}} cast, she could be perfect. They were not having much luck in casting the third new character, Jessie Spano, who was conceived as a strong, feminist activist and a straight-A student, so Engel suggested offering the role to Berkley, who gladly accepted it.|$|E
25|$|Between times 1 to 2 is {{termed the}} {{acquisition}} period. Between times 2 to 3 is termed the incubation period (1982: 520). Further, {{he states that}} {{it is not enough to}} consider only the time that has passed between 2 and 3 to make statements about attrition. It is also necessary to consider the duration, relative success, and nature of the acquisition period and the duration and content of the incubation phase (Gardner 1982: 520). The acquisition period is the time where language learning or language experience occurs, mainly from the first to the last lesson. During the incubation period, no language training or language usage occurs and the forgetting may begin. He says <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> language learning is not active anymore, a study about language attrition can be conducted (Gardner 1982a: 2).|$|E
500|$|Having been {{informed}} of this definite {{end of the}} series' run, Small decided to write [...] "Focus Grill" [...] {{with the intention of}} it concluding the show. While penning the teleplay, he kept in mind the knowledge that [...] "nothing positive [...] happening"; however, Small did admit that the final scene of the episode—Brendon's camera breaking on the road—was actually an optimistic footnote in the series' narrative. Small considers <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> Brendon is without his camera, [...] "he doesn't need this crutch anymore. That he can actually start living his life as an actual earthling." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{difficulties}} in compiling a works list for Josquin cannot be overstated. Because of his immense prestige {{in the early}} sixteenth century, many scribes and publishers did not resist the temptation of attributing anonymous or otherwise spurious works to Josquin. The German editor Georg Forster summed up the situation admirably in 1540 when he wrote, [...] "I remember a certain eminent man saying <b>that,</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> Josquin is dead, he is putting out more works than when he was alive." [...] Thus, the authenticity {{of many of the}} works listed below is disputed on stylistic grounds or problems with sources or both. This thorny issue has been taken up vigorously in the now nearly complete New Josquin Edition (NJE).|$|E
500|$|Picard orders return fire, and the Enterprise {{appears to}} disable the Borg ship. Against Guinan's advice, Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) takes an away {{team to the}} immense Borg cube where they find mostly dormant Borg drones and a Borg nursery. [...] Worf discovers that the Borg ship is {{regenerating}} and repairing the damage made by the [...] Enterprise. [...] The away team is beamed directly to the bridge, and Picard orders that they depart at maximum warp. The Borg ship immediately reactivates and begins pursuit, gaining on the Enterprise. Q appears on the bridge and warns Picard that the Borg will never stop chasing them, and cannot be defeated. Picard attempts to fight back against the Borg to no avail, and finally admits he needs Q's help. Q obliges, returning the Enterprise to its last position in Federation space. Picard, though thankful for Q's lesson, blames Q {{for the deaths of}} his crew. Q disappears, but not before reminding them again of their ill-preparedness. Guinan warns Picard <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> the Borg are aware of the Federation's presence, they will be coming. Picard reflects that perhaps Q did the right thing for the wrong reasons by bringing forward their encounter with the Borg, as it has informed the Federation for what lies ahead of them as they continue to explore.|$|E
500|$|Many {{scenes from}} the {{original}} episode were seen as vulgar and {{were removed from the}} television broadcast. [...] One of the scenes removed was {{from the beginning of the}} episode when Stewie, Chris, and his friends were watching Genital Hospital, a reference to the television show General Hospital. The original scene had included the doctor on the film undoing his zipper after discussing the patient's health problems. The edited version cut away before the doctor could undo his zipper, but the sound can still be heard when it cuts back to Chris and his friends watching the porno. Another scene edited was a naked Peter shown crouched on top of Lois's head (attempting ear sex) (even though it was shown on Adult Swim every time the episode repeats). On the TV version, Peter is still naked, but it is implied (through sound effects) that Lois forcibly pushed him to the floor and she has a hand on her ear (impling Peter attempted ear sex). In this scene, Peter refers to the Grimace as Ronald McDonald's autistic friend, which was originally penned as [...] "retarded friend" [...] (and is included in the uncut version). A scene in which Brian, wearing a robe, informs Lois of the weird tasting Smuckers jelly in the fridge leads Peter to reveal that the Smuckers was on his penis was edited on TV so that way he states that the jelly was on his crotch. In a scene added later to the episode, Mel Gibson apologizes to the Jewish community after being offensive while continuing to offend them. The scene was added after the episode had been made but prior to broadcasting. When Peter joins Meg in her quest to be abstinent, the TV version has a gag where Peter keeps mispronouncing the word, Meg corrects him, and Peter punishes her by sending her to her room. The Adult Swim and DVD version replaces that scene with one that was edited for being insensitive to Asian people in which Peter tells Meg <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> he is abstinent, he will be as untouched as the turn signal on an Asian woman's car, followed by a cutaway of an Asian lady causing an accident on an eight-lane highway. In the scene involving Stewie entering Herbert's house, a picture of Chris with the body of a model was in the animatic, but not shown on TV. The original ending of this episode (with the [...] "choose your own ending" [...] text message contest) was supposed to have Lois and Peter throw Brian out the window instead of giving Cleveland his one and only appearance in the episode. This deleted scene is featured in the episode animatic on the season five DVD set.|$|E

2500|$|Though Giles Allen was the {{landlord}} John Hyde legally owned the lease to the Theatre and would return the lease to Richard and Cuthbert Burbage and Margaret Brayne for {{the sum of}} £30.

2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{notes in}} her {{assessment}} of the review: [...] "From Camelot to Neverland, the show has never quite been able to sustain itself when it’s simply Storybrooke, as much {{as some of the}} better stories have been rooted there. So it’s not a shock to find out that, after tonight, we’re probably going to be spending some time in the Underworld next month. We already know we’re meeting Hercules and Megara; given tonight’s events, does that also mean we’re meeting Hades? The bigger (and more interesting) question at stake is the fact <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> we’re in the Underworld, how many previously dead characters {{are going to get a}} chance to return? We’ve already had confirmations of past-dead characters like Cruella and Cora, though both of those characters are supposedly strictly for the show’s 100th episode. Regardless, moving to the Underworld opens up a host of options for 5B in terms of characters and plot, and I’m curious to see what those options are." ...|$|E

Let no one have any doubts about it: we are celebrating a religious occasion; we are reflecting on a religious assassination, not a political one. Fr.

Those who killed him, those who planned his killing, wanted to silence the voice of the Gospel.... Only two days before his death, I met Fr. Kaiser for a long conversation. At the end, he asked my blessing, which I reluctantly gave him. At that moment, I thought {{it would have been better}} if he, an old and worthy missionary, had blessed me.
