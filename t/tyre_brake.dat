Fergus Anderson crashed the motorcycle on its maiden run in Modena.

40|$|The most {{important}} factor in pedestrian injuries from vehicle collisions is the impact velocity. In cases where the impact configuration can be ascertained, the most common method now used to determine vehicle speed involves the pedestrian projection distance. The more traditional method of using <b>tyre</b> <b>brake</b> marks is losing applicability as ABS braking systems become more common. The two most common impact configurations are wrap projection and forward projection, these being determined by the vehicle/pedestrian geometry and the initial conditions of the impact. In this paper, two models are presented for pedestrian forward and wrap projection impacts. These models are predicated on separating the total projection distance into the individual projection distances occurring during three principal phases of the collision. The models are novel as they use a rigid single-segment body representation of the pedestrian, include explicit modelling of the impact phase, and also allow for uncertainty in the input parameters. Published data are used to provide distributions for the input variables such as pedestrian and vehicle masses, etc. The model predictions of impact speed from overall projection distance are validated by comparison with real-world accident data...|$|E
40|$|Exposure to metal-rich {{particulate}} {{pollution is}} associated with adverse health outcomes. In particular, lead has recently {{been shown to be}} toxic in young children even at low levels previously considered â��safeâ��. Lead poisoning from vehicle pollution has been addressed internationally by removal of leaded petrol but toxic blood lead levels in children continue to be reported in urban areas, the source suggested to be resuspended roadside soil, enriched in lead due to previous leaded fuel usage. Here, we use paired geochemical and magnetic analyses of natural biomonitors - kerbside tree leaves -, and of air sample filters, to examine contemporary sources of particulate pollution, and show that co-associated, fine (< 1 ï�­m) lead- and iron-rich particles are emitted as vehicle-derived pollutants. Higher and strongly correlated lead, iron and magnetic remanence values were found closer to roads and on the road-proximal rather than road-distal sides of trees. Critically, highest pollutant values occurred on tree leaves next to uphill rather than downhill road lanes. The lead content of the leaf particulates was associated only with sub-micrometre, combustion-derived spherical particles. These results indicate that vehicle exhaust emissions, rather than resuspended soil dust, or <b>tyre,</b> <b>brake</b> or other vehicle wear, are the major source of the lead, iron and magnetic loadings on roadside tree leaves. Analysis of leaves at different heights showed that leaf particulate lead and iron concentrations are highest at ~ 0. 3 m (i. e. small child height) and at 1. 5 â�� 2 m (adult head height) above ground level; monitoring station collectors placed at 3 m above the surface thus significantly under-estimate kerbside, near-surface lead concentrations. These results indicate that vulnerable groups, especially young children, continue to be exposed to fine, lead- and iron-rich, vehicle-derived particulates...|$|E

40|$|Within a urban environment, three {{different}} sources of particulate matter should be considered: heating plants using different combustibles (natural gas, gas oil, fuel oil, wood), industrial plants {{placed in the}} surrounding area, traffic.

The latter type of emission is due to vehicle components' wear (<b>tyres,</b> <b>brakes),</b> road abrasion and dust re-suspension and its quantification is not straightforward, as the variability of the corresponding emission factors found in literature demonstrates. In this paper we tried to calculate the total PM emission factors due to traffic by means of the measured PM concentrations for a 50, 000 inhabitants town in NW Italy. At the same time we tried to assess the different contributions to the air quality of the town due to the other emission sources, namely heating and industrial plants, in order to understand who is the main responsible of the existing critical situation and to get some general information on the positive effect obtainable through different intervention policy...|$|R
50|$|The presenters were {{challenged}} {{to make an}} ordinary car lap the track {{as fast as a}} Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X, which has a time of 1 minute 28 seconds, using only the price difference from that ordinary car to a used Lancer Evo. They did not know what car they would have to work with. Despite May's prediction of a Hyundai Accent 3-cylinder diesel, the car was revealed to be a 2002 Renault Avantime. Notwithstanding various modifications—including wheels, <b>tyres,</b> <b>brakes,</b> the exhaust of an unknown TVR, the rear wing from an F1 car (which was later taken off), a wooden front splitter (which caught fire)—the presenters were unable to beat the Evo's time. They did improve on the original time by 7.1 seconds, but this was achieved mostly through a combination of swapping out the heavy, electrically heated seats that came with the Avantime for much lighter carbon fibre racing seats, and May servicing the engine to get it nearer its originally rated power. The presenters noted that the other modifications generally didn't help, and some even made the car slower. The only modifications that did work properly cost little beyond the time, effort and relatively simple equipment used.|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{frictions}} phenomena, {{related to}} the wear and the abrasion of <b>tyres,</b> <b>brakes,</b> clutch, and road surface, are responsible for significant particle emissions of the non-exhaust road vehicles which are considered as vectors of various toxic, carcinogens or mutagen substances. Their rate is high and the particles represent, today, major impacts on public health and on the environment. Physical characteristics of the non-exhaust road transport and surface emissions could be analyzed in a laboratory situation under controlled condition if suitable deceleration profiles and sampling systems are developed having the ability to increase the non-exhaust emissions. The aim {{of this paper is}} to develop the deceleration profiles, thus increasing the production rate of particles during urban, suburban, and highway driving conditions, allowing their identification and analysis. Experiments have been performed confirming the reliability of the developed braking profiles. A load effect, a large clustering, and the presence of isolated clusters and fibers have been observed. Size analysis indicated a high production of the particles in the range of [7 nm, 4 ¼m]. Further experiments and processing of data is necessary to confirm identification and quantification of the non-exhaust emissions taking into account atmospheric and turbulence features and the traffic.
