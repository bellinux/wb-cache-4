5|$|Biman's {{handling}} of Hajj flights {{has also been}} beset with troubles. In 2005, the State Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism resigned after complaints that he set fares too high. In 2006, Biman took the unprecedented step of removing the business–class seats from its dedicated Hajj flights to accommodate more economy-class passengers. Procedural irregularities by the Hajj agencies delayed the confirmation of pilgrims' visas, and Biman had to cancel 19 flights owing to lack of sufficient passengers. Once the situation was resolved, Biman was then unable to offer the required number of flights to cope with <b>the</b> <b>backlog</b> of passengers.|$|E

In January 2015, United Airlines ordered 10 Boeing 777-300ERs, normally costing around $150 million each but paid around $130 million, a discount to bridge the production gap to the 777X.|$|E

5|$|There was a seat vacant on the U.S. Supreme Court in 1889, and Governor Foraker {{suggested}} President Harrison appoint Taft to fill it. Taft was 32 and {{his professional}} goal {{was always a}} seat on the Supreme Court. He actively sought the appointment, writing to Foraker to urge the governor to press his case, while stating to others it was unlikely he would get it. Instead, in 1890, Harrison appointed him Solicitor General of the United States. When Taft arrived in Washington in February 1890, the office had been vacant two months, with the work piling up. He worked to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>backlog,</b> while simultaneously educating himself on federal law and procedure he had not needed as an Ohio state judge.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} period, the Court was also {{assisted}} by two Registrars, who enrolled decrees {{of the court}} and orders; their books documented the legal precedent set by the court. At the same time, two Examiners were appointed to assist the Master of the Rolls in examining witnesses. The positions were regularly and openly sold by the Master of the Rolls and Lord Chancellor– Masters in Chancery went for £6,000 in 1625. To avoid the sale of offices, and due to the corruption of many court officials, an Act was passed that year requiring that fees be paid directly into the Bank of England, and creating an Accountant-General to oversee the financial aspects of the court. In 1813 the first Vice-Chancellor was appointed {{to deal with the}} increasing number of cases submitted to the Court. With <b>the</b> <b>backlog</b> growing larger, two more were appointed in 1841 under a second Act of Parliament, although this provided for two life appointments, not two new positions; when the new Vice-Chancellors died, there could be no replacements. With the dissolution of the Court in 1873, the position of Vice-Chancellor ceased to exist.|$|E

5|$|Rwanda's {{legal system}} is {{largely based on}} German and Belgian civil law systems and {{customary}} law. The judiciary is independent of the executive branch, although the President and the Senate {{are involved in the}} appointment of Supreme Court judges. Human Rights Watch have praised the Rwandan government for progress made in the delivery of justice including the abolition of the death penalty, but also allege interference in the judicial system by members of the government, such as the politically motivated appointment of judges, misuse of prosecutorial power, and pressure on judges to make particular decisions. The constitution provides for two types of courts: ordinary and specialised. Ordinary courts are the Supreme Court, the High Court, and regional courts, while specialised courts are military courts and a system of commercial courts created in 2011 to expedite commercial litigations. Between 2004 and 2012, a system of Gacaca courts was in operation. Gacaca, a Rwandan traditional court operated by villages and communities, was revived to expedite the trials of genocide suspects. The court succeeded in clearing <b>the</b> <b>backlog</b> of genocide cases, but was criticised by human rights groups as not meeting legal fair standard.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{practical}} experiences {{reveal that}} the inflation is non-deterministic and variable. Therefore, a mathematical model for the optimal production for an inventory control system of deteriorating items is formulated under time-varying and stochastic inflation environment. The demand rate {{is a function of}} inflation and the time horizon is finite. In the real situation, some but not all customers will wait for backlogged items during a shortage period, such as for fashionable commodities or high-tech products with the short product life cycle. The longer the waiting time is, <b>the</b> smaller <b>the</b> <b>backlogging</b> rate would be. According to such phenomenon, taking <b>the</b> <b>backlogging</b> rate into account is necessary. Thus, the model incorporates partial <b>backlogging.</b> <b>The</b> total cost consists of the deterioration cost, production cost, inventory holding cost, backordering cost, lost sale cost and ordering cost is formulated as an optimal control problem. The numerical example has been provided for evaluation and validation of the theoretical results and some special cases of the model are discussed.
