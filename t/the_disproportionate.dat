This would lead to inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variability.|$|E
5|$|Jainism {{is perhaps}} the only {{religion}} {{in the world that}} requires all its adherents to follow a strict vegetarian diet. Vegetarian food that also involves more harm to the living beings such as roots, bulbs, multi seeded vegetables etc. are avoided by strict Jains. The importance of ahimsa manifests in many other ways in the daily life of Jains. For a layperson it means participating in business that results in least amount of violence to living beings. No furs, plumes or silk are worn. Use of leather is kept to a minimum and must in any event be from naturally dead animals. Food is usually eaten during the day unless unavoidable, since there is too much danger of injuring insects in cooking at night. The Jain will not use an open light nor leave a container of liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed; even with this precaution, liquids are always strained before use. Through the ages Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury, and this accounts for <b>the</b> <b>disproportionate</b> number who have entered banking, commerce and other mercantile trades.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into ten subject-related chapters. The first chapter {{provides}} an introduction to how Stursberg entered the CBC scene, how he viewed his role replacing the retiring Harold Redekopp as the executive {{vice president in charge}} of English services, and previews what challenges he would encounter. The second chapter covers his experience entering CBC senior management amid contract negotiations with its union, the resulting lock out during summer 2005, and the relations between what he labeled the Gang of Four (senior management) and the Central Committee (union representatives). In the third chapter, Entertainment, he explains his plan for re-orienting CBC television towards entertainment which would use audience numbers to gauge success. He cancelled critically acclaimed shows (Da Vinci's City Hall, This Is Wonderland, and Opening Night) which had low ratings and ordered what he expected would be more audience-friendly shows. Beginning in summer 2006, the first new show under Stursberg's strategy, , received very low ratings and was quickly cancelled. That Autumn's schedule, though, was successful, introducing Little Mosque on the Prairie, The Tudors, Heartland. The nest year's schedule introduced the successful The Border and Being Erica but also the unsuccessful MVP and jPod. Strusberg's move of Marketplace to Friday nights resulted in higher ratings but his plan to move The National to 11pm was denied by the CBC board of directors. In the fourth chapter, The French, he details his relationship with his French counterpart, the style differences between English and French television shows, <b>the</b> <b>disproportionate</b> funding given to the French services, and the lack of CBC Board members who can understand French. As a means of trying to bridge the two cultures, he ordered English versions of the popular Quebec shows Rumours and Sophie but both received low ratings in English Canada.|$|E

Despite <b>the</b> <b>disproportionate</b> representation of mentally ill persons in prison, a study by American Psychological Association indicates that only 7.5 percent of crimes committed {{were found to be}} directly related to mental illness. However, some advocates argue that many incarcerations of mentally ill persons could have been avoided if they had been given proper treatment, which would be a much less costly alternative to incarceration.|$|E
40|$|The kinetic and {{structural}} {{analyses of the}} polymer resulting from the Cu(0) /Me- 6 -TREN-mediated polymerization of methyl acrylate (MA) initiated with methyl 2 -bromopropionate (MBP) in solvents mediating different degrees of disproportionation are reported. Accurate analyses of the polymerization and of the resulting polymer demand a minimum combination of techniques that includes kinetics, GPC, H- 1 NMR, and MALDI-TOF both performed before and after chain-end functionalization via thio-bromo "click" chemistry and reinitiation experiments.

25|$|The {{casualties}} {{inflicted by}} the 395th Infantry Regiment, 99th Division, on the Germans are reflected by <b>the</b> <b>disproportionate</b> numbers of {{dead and wounded}}. The 395th hit the Germans with such terrific small arms and machine gun fire that they couldn't even remove their dead and wounded in their rapid retreat. The accurate fire from the twelve 3-inch guns of A Company, 612th Tank Destroyer Battalion, was instrumental in keeping German tanks from advancing. During {{the first day of}} the Battle of the Bulge, the 3rd Battalion took 19 prisoners and killed an estimated 200 Germans. Accurate estimates of German wounded were not possible, but about 20 percent of the 326th Volksgrenadier Division were lost. The 395th's casualties were extremely light: four dead, seven wounded, and four men missing.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, {{because of}} the PSC growth, Convergence and Union had lost the vote share for the first time, but had won the most seats due to <b>the</b> <b>disproportionate</b> {{allocation}} of seats in Girona, Lleida and Tarragona respect to Barcelona.

In spite of this, and despite Pujol's approval ratings remaining high, rumours about his possible retirement and a desire for change had resulted in CiU trailing the PSC in opinion polls for the entire legislature, with a lead nearly into the double digits by mid-to-late 2002. From mid-2003, however, the Socialist lead had begun to narrow to the point that speculation arose about a possible reenactment of the 1999 results.|$|E

25|$|During the Second World War, Gale applied these {{principles}} {{to the development}} of airborne forces. An advocate of shock manoeuvre with elite forces, Gale stressed extensive training, the use of the latest battlefield technologies and strong personal leadership. For Gale, the quality of one's military forces were as important as their number, and he drew additional lessons on <b>the</b> <b>disproportionate</b> effect that surprise manoeuvre had on a 'demoralised or unprepared enemy', as opposed to a 'well-trained opposition', from the operations of his own 6th Airborne Division in Normandy. Later in life, Gale examined the issues of war in the nuclear age.

25|$|Bangalore's {{rapid growth}} has created several {{problems}} relating to traffic congestion and infrastructural obsolescence that the Bangalore Mahanagara Palike has found challenging to address. The unplanned nature {{of growth in}} the city resulted in massive traffic gridlocks that the municipality attempted to ease by constructing a flyover system and by imposing one-way traffic systems. Some of the flyovers and one-ways mitigated the traffic situation moderately but were unable to adequately address <b>the</b> <b>disproportionate</b> growth of city traffic. A 2003 Battelle Environmental Evaluation System (BEES) evaluation of Bangalore's physical, biological and socioeconomic parameters indicated that Bangalore's water quality and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems were close to ideal, while the city's socioeconomic parameters (traffic, quality of life) aire quality and noise pollution scored poorly. The BBMP works in conjunction with the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) and the Agenda for Bangalore's Infrastructure and Development Task Force (ABIDe) to design and implement civic and infrastructural projects.|$|E
25|$|Slates {{for local}} offices were {{certified}} by each candidate. In rural Grant Parish in Red River Valley, freedmen fearing a Democratic {{attempt to take}} over the parish government reinforced defenses at the small Colfax courthouse in late March. White militias gathered from the area a few miles outside the settlement. Rumors and fears abounded on both sides. William Ward, an African-American Union veteran and militia captain, mustered his company in Colfax and went to the courthouse. On Easter Sunday, April 13, 1873, the whites attacked the defenders at the courthouse. There was confusion about who shot one of the white leaders after an offer by the defenders to surrender. It was a catalyst to mayhem. In the end, three whites died and 120–150 blacks were killed, some 50 that evening while being held as prisoners. <b>The</b> <b>disproportionate</b> numbers of black to white fatalities and documentation of brutalized bodies are why contemporary historians call it the Colfax Massacre rather than the Colfax Riot, as it was known locally.|$|E

Payments from US government made under the South Pacific Tuna Treaty (SPTT) was about $9million in 1999. In May 2013 representatives from the United States and the Pacific Islands countries agreed to sign interim arrangement documents to extend the Multilateral Fisheries Treaty (which encompasses the South Pacific Tuna Treaty) to confirm access to the fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific for US tuna boats for 18 months. In 2015 Tuvalu has refused to sell fishing days to certain nations and fleets that have blocked Tuvaluan initiatives to develop and sustain their own fishery.

25|$|Federal Actions {{to address}} <b>the</b> <b>disproportionate</b> health and {{environmental}} disparities that minority and low-income populations face through Executive Order (E.O) 12898, required federal agencies to make environmental justice central to their programs and policies. Superfund sites {{have been shown to}} impact minority communities the most. Despite legislation specifically designed to ensure equity in Superfund listing, marginalized populations still experience a lesser chance of successful listing and cleanup than areas with higher income levels. After the executive order had been put in place, there persisted a discrepancy between the demographics of the communities living near toxic waste sites and their listing as Superfund sites, which would otherwise grant them federally funded cleanup projects. Communities with both increased minority and low-income populations were found to have lowered their chances of site listing after the executive order, while on the other hand, increases in income led to greater chances of site listing. Of the populations living within 1 mile radius of a Superfund site, 44% of those are minorities despite only being around 37% of the nation's population. It has also been shown that the government responds slower to community demands from minority communities than from white communities. Superfund sites near white communities have seen better clean up and harsher penalties for the polluters than minority communities.|$|E
