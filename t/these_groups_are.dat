5|$|Examples and {{applications}} of groups abound. A {{starting point is}} the group Z of integers with addition as group operation, introduced above. If instead of addition multiplication is considered, one obtains multiplicative groups. <b>These</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> predecessors of important constructions in abstract algebra.|$|E
5|$|Extremophile archaea {{are members}} of four main {{physiological}} groups. These are the halophiles, thermophiles, alkaliphiles, and acidophiles. <b>These</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> not comprehensive or phylum-specific, nor are they mutually exclusive, since some archaea belong to several groups. Nonetheless, they are a useful starting point for classification.|$|E
5|$|In the second, mild {{protection}} scheme, A and dA {{are protected}} with isobutyryl or phenoxyacetyl groups (PAC). C and dC bear acetyl protection, and G and dG are protected with 4-isopropylphenoxyacetyl (iPr-PAC) or dimethylformamidino (dmf) groups. Mild protecting groups are removed {{more readily than}} the standard protecting groups. However, the phosphoramidites bearing <b>these</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> less stable when stored in solution.|$|E

5|$|The {{groups are}} divided {{based on their}} {{alternative}} strategies of parasitizing its host colony (Myrmica ants). The predatory (in which the caterpillar preys on the host ants) and 'cuckoo' (in which the caterpillars feed off of the ants' regurgitation) strategies are derived characteristics from the alcon group, with the predatory strategy having evolved from the teleius group and the cuckoo strategy having evolved from the arion-Phengaris group. Another way <b>these</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> categorized is by {{whether or not they}} release a certain chemical (dorsal nectary organ secretions) {{to attract the attention of}} the host ant. This trait is not as prominent in ancestors of the alcon group and in the M. nausithous, which is part of the teleius group.|$|E
5|$|The show follows {{several groups}} of meerkats, who act communally {{for the benefit}} of the groups in which they live. <b>These</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} led by a dominant female and male, who maintain almost exclusive rights to have offspring. The group followed most closely is known as the Whiskers family. This group was chosen because of its matriarch Flower, an unusually successful dominant female who led the group for five years. During series three, Flower died from a snake bite and was succeeded by her daughter Rocket Dog.|$|E
5|$|The {{surviving}} {{members of}} the Cofradía de San José {{who lived in the}} vicinity of Mount San Cristobal and Mount Banahaw, continued with their religious activities and were known as colorums, a corruption of the Latin phrase in saecula saeculorum ("unto the ages of ages") which was used at Mass to end prayers. During the American colonial era, the term colorum was applied to all the cults and insurgent groups characterized by Roman Catholic devotion, folk superstition, and hero worship. Some of <b>these</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> still active today in various provinces in the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|Tilings with {{translational}} symmetry in {{two independent}} directions {{can be categorized}} by wallpaper groups, of which 17 exist. It has been claimed that all seventeen of <b>these</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> represented in the Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. Though this is disputed, the variety and sophistication of the Alhambra tilings have surprised modern researchers. Of the three regular tilings two are in the p6m wallpaper group and one is in p4m. Tilings in 2D with translational symmetry in just one direction can be categorized by the seven frieze groups describing the possible frieze patterns. Orbifold notation {{can be used to}} describe wallpaper groups of the Euclidean plane.|$|E
5|$|In {{evolutionary}} terms, {{the split}} between the Caelifera and the Ensifera is no more recent than the Permo-Triassic boundary; the earliest insects that are certainly Caeliferans are in the extinct families Locustopseidae and Locustavidae from the early Triassic, roughly 250 million years ago. The group diversified during the Triassic and have remained important plant-eaters from that time to now. The first modern families such as the Eumastacidae, Tetrigidae and Tridactylidae appeared in the Cretaceous, though some insects that might belong to the last two of <b>these</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> found in the early Jurassic. Morphological classification is difficult because many taxa have converged towards a common habitat type; recent taxonomists have concentrated on the internal genitalia, especially those of the male. This information is not available from fossil specimens, and the palaentological taxonomy is founded principally on the venation of the hindwings.|$|E
5|$|The Heterodontosauridae family persisted {{from the}} Late Triassic until the Early Cretaceous period, and existed {{for at least}} a 100 million years. Heterodontosaurids are known from Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas, but the {{majority}} have been found in southern Africa. Heterodontosaurids appear to have split into two main lineages by the Early Jurassic; one with low-crowned teeth, and one with high-crowned teeth (including Heterodontosaurus). The members of <b>these</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> divided biogeographically, with the low-crowned group having been discovered in areas that were once part of Laurasia (northern landmass), and the high-crowned group from areas that were part of Gondwana (southern landmass). In 2012, Sereno labelled members of the latter grouping a distinct subfamily, Heterodontosaurinae. Heterodontosaurus appears to be the most derived heterodontosaurine, due to details in its teeth, such as very thin enamel, arranged in an asymmetrical pattern. The unique tooth and jaw features of heterodontosaurines appear to be specialisations for effectively processing plant material, and their level of sophistication is comparable to that of later ornithischians.|$|E

5|$|The game is set after {{a fictional}} World War III, {{the events of}} which have killed off much of the population; those left alive are forced to fight for survival. Some of the {{survivors}} have formed gangs, some turned into mutants from the war's radiation, and some joined an evil militia; collectively, <b>these</b> <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> known as Wastelanders. Raiding different towns and villages, the Wastelanders sought to prey on the townspeople by stealing supplies, forcing some into slavery, and killing others. The heroine of the story, Angel, travels {{from town to town}} in search of her lost friend, Ekx, while helping the town's survivors fend off attacks from Wastelanders. Cruising in her armored car, Gypsy, she makes use of the car's mounted machine guns to defend the towns from thieves and slavers. The first lead Angel finds on her lost friend is from the city of Core, where Ekx was seen traveling through the city on his way to Coalhaven. Angel reaches Coalhaven and uses her armored car to defend the city from members of the renegade militia. After repelling the enemy, the townspeople re-establish their wireless communications and contact the nearby city of New Dallas. Recognizing the voice on the other end, the receiving operator in New Dallas turns out to be Angel's lost friend, Ekx. Ekx confides in Angel that he needs her for something urgent and that she must join him in New Dallas.|$|E
