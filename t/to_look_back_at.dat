500|$|At some points, {{the player}} can use Athena's [...] "mood matrix" [...] {{mechanic}} to detect conflicting emotions in witnesses' voices during their testimonies, such as sudden happiness {{in the middle}} of fear. Four different emotions can show up in testimony analyses – happiness, anger, shock, and sadness (the icon of which also represents fear) – which will light up with different intensity. The player goes through the testimony, and aims to determine the cause of the conflicting emotion. Near the end of trials, when the player is close to solving the case, they can use the [...] "revisualization" [...] mechanic <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> known facts and make a series of deductions by picking the right choices, to reach a conclusion.|$|E
500|$|Historically {{the rocky}} outcrop was known locally by the Malays {{in earlier times}} as [...] "Batu Berlayar" [...] ("Sailing Rock") near the present site of Labrador Park, off Pasir Panjang Road. Another rock outcrop used {{to stand on the}} {{opposite}} shore of Tanjong Rimau on Sentosa Island. These two rock outcrops once formed a gateway at the western entrance to Keppel Harbour. British sailors named the more prominent Batu Berlayar, [...] "Lot's Wife" [...] in reference to the biblical story of the wife of Abraham's nephew. She was transformed into a pillar of salt when she disobeyed divine orders not <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the destruction of Sodom while fleeing from the city. It is argued that the two rocky outcrops are the two hills of Temasek named in Yuan sources as Long Ya Men (Dragon's Teeth Gate) since they resembled two dragon's teeth between which a passage of water runs. [...] Another name Ling Ya Men (...) is recorded in the Song dynasty work Zhu Fan Zhi, however it is usually considered to be a different place.|$|E
2500|$|The {{desire for}} a 'human' Jesus {{is not the only}} Biblical topic {{discussed}} in the novel. Another reference involves the story of Lot’s wife disobeying and turning <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The narrator of that chapter, possibly seen as Vonnegut himself, claims that he loves Lot’s wife doing so [...] "because it was so human." [...] Amanda Wicks speaks on this incorporation of Lot's wife and the narrating voice stating, [...] "Vonnegut naturally aligns himself with Lot’s wife since both occupy the role of spectators shattered by the act of witnessing." [...] The narrator's alignment with Lot's wife also creates a good pretext for the understanding of Billy Pilgrim’s psyche throughout the destruction of Dresden.|$|E

2500|$|At the 19th regular {{session in}} March 2012, the UNHRC adopted {{resolution}} 19/2 on promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka {{by a vote}} of 24 in favour, 15 against and 8 abstentions. The resolution welcomed the constructive recommendations contained in the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), a commission of inquiry appointed by the Sri Lankan government <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the civil war, and noted with concern that the report did not adequately address serious allegations of violations of international law. It called upon the government of Sri Lanka to implement constructive recommendations made in the LLRC report and to take all necessary additional steps to fulfill its relevant legal obligations to initiate credible and independent actions to ensure justice, equity, accountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans. It requested the government to present an action plan detailing the steps that it has taken and will take to implement the recommendations made in the commission's report, and also to address alleged violations of international law. The resolution also encouraged the (OHCHR) to provide advice and technical assistance on implementing the above-mentioned steps; and requested the OHCHR to present a report on the provision of such assistance to the Human Rights Council at its 22nd session in March 2013. Two last-minute changes to the resolution, pressed by India, made it [...] "unobtrusive" [...] in nature and [...] "non-judgemental" [...] in approach. These amendmnents gave the Government of Sri Lanka, a veto over any future recommendations by the OHCHR. There was no reference to alleged war crimes or an international investigation, as called for by human rights groups.|$|E
2500|$|In 1925, {{the family}} settled in Paris, {{where they would}} live for the next 14 years. At about this time Tsvetaeva {{contracted}} tuberculosis. Tsvetaeva received a small stipend from the Czechoslovak government, which gave financial support to artists and writers {{who had lived in}} Czechoslovakia. In addition, she tried to make whatever she could from readings and sales of her work. She turned more and more to writing prose because she found it made more money than poetry. Tsvetaeva did not feel at all at home in Paris's predominantly ex-bourgeois circle of Russian émigré writers. Although she had written passionately pro-'White' poems during the Revolution, her fellow émigrés thought that she was insufficiently anti-Soviet, and that her criticism of the Soviet régime was altogether too nebulous. She was particularly criticised for writing an admiring letter to the Soviet poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. In the wake of this letter, the émigré paper The Latest News, to which Tsvetaeva had been a frequent contributor, refused point-blank to publish any more of her work. She found solace in her correspondence with other writers, including Boris Pasternak, Rainer Maria Rilke, the Czech poet Anna Teskova, the critics D. S. Mirsky and Aleksandr Bakhrakh, and the Georgian émigré princess Salomea Andronikova, who became her main source of financial support. Her poetry and critical prose of the time, including her autobiographical prose works of 1934–7, is of lasting literary importance. [...] "Consumed by the daily round", resenting the domesticity that left her no time for solitude or writing, her émigré milieu regarded Tsvetaeva as a crude sort who ignored social graces. Describing her misery, she wrote to Teskova [...] "In Paris, with rare personal exceptions, everyone hates me, they write all sorts of nasty things, leave me out in all sorts of nasty ways, and so on". To Pasternak she complained [...] "They don't like poetry and what am I apart from that, not poetry but that from which it is made. [...] an inhospitable hostess. An young woman in an old dress." [...] She began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> even the Prague times with nostalgia and resent her exiled state more deeply.|$|E

40|$|A {{long-term}} {{qualitative study}} of the student experience at Mount Royal University sheds light on how students perceive threshold concepts related to information literacy (IL). The transcripts of over 400 interviews provide evidence of students {{in various stages of}} learning, from seeing only walls with no doorways, let alone thresholds, <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> breakthrough moments in learning. While students use entirely different language to the ACRL Framework, they nevertheless describe understanding of the concepts, and related practices and dispositions. Understanding these concepts from the students 2 ̆ 7 point of view may assist with developing activities and assignments, that encourage crossing these thresholds, and assessments that can help both the students and us as teachers know when that crossing happens. After a brief introduction, participants will work with excerpts from the study to discern markers of learning related to threshold concepts and use those markers to generate ideas for teaching...|$|R
