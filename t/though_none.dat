5|$|Germanium is {{not thought}} to be an {{essential}} element for any living organism. Some complex organic germanium compounds are being investigated as possible pharmaceuticals, <b>though</b> <b>none</b> have yet proven successful. Similar to silicon and aluminum, natural germanium compounds tend to be insoluble in water and thus have little oral toxicity. However, synthetic soluble germanium salts are nephrotoxic, and synthetic chemically reactive germanium compounds with halogens and hydrogen are irritants and toxins.|$|E

Several varieties have been named, <b>though</b> <b>none</b> are now recognised as distinct. It was first cultivated in the United Kingdom in 1791. I.anemonifolius grows readily in the garden if located in a sunny or part-shaded spot with sandy soil and good drainage.|$|E

The Aberdeen Registrum noted {{that he began to}} rebuild the cathedral, and Hector Boece gave a description of his rebuilding, noting that although he finished the walls and two belltowers, the third belltower remained unfinished at his death. Licthon also constructed a new chapel dedicated to St John the Evangelist, and donated much of his own money to new service books and vestments, {{as well as to the}} reconstruction of the cathedral.

5|$|Having been {{promoted}} to temporary wing commander on 1August 1943, Rawlinson handed over command of No.79 Squadron on 7November and was appointed wing leader of No.73 Wing, headquartered at Kiriwina. The wing leader was responsible for tactical command of the formation in the air. Minimal offensive air activity by the Japanese meant that No.79 Squadron's Spitfires saw relatively little action; the wing's Kittyhawks, with their ground-attack capability, were heavily engaged. On 15December, {{the day of the}} Allied landings at Arawe, No.76 Squadron Kittyhawks patrolled above the beaches while the Spitfires remained at Kiriwina in case of strikes by Japanese raiders, <b>though</b> <b>none</b> came.|$|E

5|$|In {{subsequent}} years Perfini released {{a number of}} commercially oriented films, such as Delapan Pendjuru Angin (Eight Compass Directions, 1957) and Asrama Dara (Dormitory for Girls, 1958). <b>Though</b> <b>none</b> of these were commercial failures, none except for Asrama Dara approached the financial success of Tiga Dara. Ismail attempted to reassert himself as a director of quality not-for-profit films through Pedjuang (Warriors for Freedom, 1960), which was screened in competition at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival in 1961.

Together with the Istana, it was gazetted a national monument on 14 February 1992.|$|E
5|$|The IJN's faulty anti-submarine {{doctrine}} {{also contributed}} to Japan's shipping losses. The Navy had placed a low priority on protecting merchant shipping from submarine attack {{before and during the}} early years of the war and convoys were not routinely assembled until 1943. The Grand Escort Headquarters was formed in late 1943 to coordinate convoys and implement a standard doctrine. The Escort-of-Convoy headquarters was also established in April 1944 to provide a pool of senior commanders who were available to command convoys, <b>though</b> <b>none</b> had any experience with convoy operations or anti-submarine warfare.|$|E
