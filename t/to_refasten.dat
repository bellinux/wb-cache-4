With {{her face as}} if masked, all black {{from head to foot}} except for some flowers in her hat, she looked up {{mechanically}} at the clock. She thought it must have stopped. She could not believe that only two minutes had passed since she had looked at it last. Of course not. It had been stopped all the time. As a matter of fact, only three minutes had elapsed from the moment she had drawn the first deep, easy breath after the blow, to this moment when Mrs Verloc formed the resolution to drown herself in the Thames. But Mrs Verloc could not believe that. She seemed to have heard or read that clocks and watches always stopped at the moment of murder for the undoing of the murderer.

500|$|On July 9, 2012, the National Park Service {{announced}} that the monument would be closed for repairs until 2014. The National Park Service hired construction management firm Hill International in conjunction with joint-venture partner Louis Berger Group to provide coordination between the designer, Wiss, Janney, and Elstner Associates, the general contractor Perini, and numerous stakeholders. NPS said {{a portion of the}} plaza {{at the base of the}} monument would be removed and scaffolding constructed around the exterior. In July 2013, lighting was added to the scaffolding. Some stone pieces saved during the 2011 inspection will be <b>refastened</b> <b>to</b> the monument, while [...] "Dutchman patches" [...] will be used in other places. Several of the stone lips that help hold the pyramidion's [...] exterior slabs in place were also damaged, so engineers will install metal brackets to more securely fasten them to the monument.|$|R
