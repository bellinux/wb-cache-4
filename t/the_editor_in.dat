5|$|Chenevix-Trench {{was known}} for his {{substantial}} tenures as headmaster of Bradfield College, Eton College and Fettes College; he had also taught at Shrewsbury School. He died in 1979. In 1994, a book by Tim Card, a former Vice-Provost of Eton, revealed {{for the first time that}} Chenevix-Trench had not left his position as headmaster of Eton of his own accord. There followed some newspaper articles critical of Chenevix-Trench's use of corporal punishment, and numerous letters to <b>the</b> <b>editor</b> <b>in</b> response, most of which were positive about Chenevix-Trench's legacy. Peel, a teacher at Fettes College at the time, published The Land of Lost Content two years later.|$|E
5|$|In {{a letter}} to <b>the</b> <b>editor</b> <b>in</b> Aftenposten on 17 June, {{submitted}} by Robert M. Steen, {{it was suggested that}} reaching the ledge would be a suitable challenge for the mountaineering association Norsk Tindeklub. The newspaper contacted the club, and offered to cover all expenses. The club sent Boye Schlytter and Henning Tønsberg to Bergen, where they joined forces with police officer Hermann Heggenes and photographer and firefighter Alf Adriansen. The expedition was led by Balchen, arriving with the BSD vessel Vulcanus. Arne Næss, Jr. had just used bolts to climb the Dolomites, and these had been lent to Tønsberg. As such, {{it was the first time}} bolts were used for climbing in Norway.|$|E
5|$|Information differs {{as to who}} {{replaced}} Larssen. According to Evald Solbakken, and also to the reference bibliography Norske aviser 1763–1969, the replacement was Olav Scheflo, who needed a stand-in, Ingvald B. Jacobsen, for the first period. According to the encyclopaedia Arbeidernes Leksikon and historian Einhart Lorenz, Trond Hegna was <b>the</b> <b>editor</b> <b>in</b> 1927, before he took over Norges Kommunistblad {{in the summer of}} 1927. Hegna's main job was to edit the periodical Mot Dag, but in this period the people of Mot Dag had an informal influence on the Communist Party and several of their newspapers. Scheflo formally edited the newspaper from 1927 to 1928, with Eivind Petershagen as acting editor from late 1927. In 1928 Petershagen formally took over, only to have Jørgen Vogt become acting editor later that year. Vogt took over in 1929.|$|E

5|$|The Nordland Line {{was first}} {{publicly}} proposed by Ole Tobias Olsen {{in a letter}} to <b>the</b> <b>editor</b> <b>in</b> Morgenbladet in 1872, where he argued for a railway between Trondheim and his home county of Nordland. The same year, Nord-Trøndelag County Council voted in favor to start planning of a railway between Trondheim and Namsos. The county council appointed a railway committee in 1875, who on 23 August 1876 published a report to encourage national authorities to consider the line, which resulted in surveying starting in 1877. On 27 April 1881, the committee made its recommendation to the county council and ceased its work. No planning was done the next three years, until three county councilors, Vilhelm Andreas Wexelsen, Peter Theodor Holst and Bernhard Øverland, made a new proposal. However, it was not until 1889 that the county council appointed a new railway committee, which was led by Wexelsen.|$|E
