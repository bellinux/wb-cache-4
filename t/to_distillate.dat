40|$|A bench-scale, {{sweeping}} gas, flat-sheet Membrane Distillation (MD) {{unit was}} used to assess the importance of membrane architecture and operational variables <b>to</b> <b>distillate</b> production rate. Sweeping gas membrane distillation (SGMD) was simulated for various membrane characteristics (material, pore size, porosity and thickness), spacer dimensions and operating conditions (influent brine temperature, sweep gas flow rate and brine flow rate) based on coupled mass and energy balances. Model calibration was carried out using four membranes that differed in terms of material selection, effective pore size, thickness and porosity. Membrane tortuosity was the lone fitting parameter. Distillate fluxes and temperature profiles from experiments matched simulations over a wide range of operating conditions. Limitations <b>to</b> <b>distillate</b> production were then investigated via simulations, noting implications for MD design and operation. Under the majority of conditions investigated, membrane resistance to mass transport provided the primary limitation to water purification rate. The nominal or effective membrane pore size and the lumped parameter epsilon/delta tau (porosity divided by the product of membrane tortuosity and thickness) were primary determinants of membrane resistance to mass transport. Resistance to Knudsen diffusion dominated membrane resistance at pore diameters < 0. 3 mu m. At larger pore sizes, a combination of resistances to intra-pore molecular diffusion and convection across the gas-phase boundary layer determined mass transport resistance. Findings are restricted to the module design flow regimes considered in the modeling effort. Nevertheless, the value of performance simulation to membrane distillation design and operation is well illustrated...|$|E

30|$|As we have {{discussed}} in the previous sections, the entanglement distribution between the two parties, Alice and Bob, is particularly challenging due to the large losses involved. Moreover, while in the optical case the noise added by a room temperature environment corresponds to the vacuum, in the microwave regime, this noise would correspond to a thermal state containing ∼ 103 photons. Even in the most favourable situation in which we build a cryogenic setup to share the entanglement, {{we would have a}} collapse of the correlations after ∼ 10 m due to the detection inefficiency and losses. The implementation of quantum repeaters in the microwave regime could potentially solve this issue. A quantum repeater is able <b>to</b> <b>distillate</b> entanglement and to share it at larger distance, at the expense of efficiency. A protocol for distributing entanglement at large distance in the microwave regime has been recently proposed in [57], but it relies on the implementation of an optical-to-microwave quantum interface [58], which has not yet been realised experimentally.|$|E

Batch mode experiments were conducted in a quartz reactor system using various reactive and nonreactive plasmas. In these experiments a high-sulfur asphalt was exposed to various plasmas, and the degree of conversion <b>to</b> <b>distillate,</b> gas, and solids was recorded. Products from selected experiments were analyzed to determine if the plasma exposure had resulted in a significant reduction in sulfur content. Exploratory experiments were conducted using reactive plasmas generated from hydrogen and methane and nonreactive plasmas generated from nitrogen. The effects of varying exposure duration, sample temperature, and location of the sample with respect to the plasma discharge were investigated. For comparative purposes two experiments were conducted in which the sample was heated under nitrogen with no plasma exposure. Distillates containing approximately 28 % less sulfur than the feedstock represented the maximum desulfurization attained in the plasma experiments. It does not appear that plasma reactions using the simple configurations employed in this study represent a viable method for the desulfurization of heavy oils...|$|E

In the present study, the pilot plant packed batch distillation column was used <b>to</b> <b>distillate</b> the binary methanol-water mixture, and to obtain on-line temperature values. The top temperature changes with time were observed at steady-state and dynamic conditions. The column was operated initially for approximately one hour at the total reflux. In this case, There were no feed and product flows. Temperature samples were taken on-line from {{the top and bottom}} of the column. Temperature profiles observed on the computer were recorded. Refractive index of the samples were determined. When the temperatures were constant, the system was at a steady-state condition for total reflux. After the system reached the steady-state condition the reflux ratio was adjusted to a certain level. From experimental top and bottom temperature values, two models were obtained between mol fraction and temperature. The mass transfer coefficient was calculated, and the final mol fraction of reboiler was determined. The column height was calculated and compared with the real packed height. It is noted that the equation used for mass transfer coefficient is considerable well...|$|E
