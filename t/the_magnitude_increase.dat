40|$|Abstract. During {{the course}} of UBV {{photoelectric}} measurements made at the Catania Astrophysical Observatory we have observed an unusually intense optical flare on the nearby M dwarf G 102 - 21, the optical counterpart of a strong X-ray source recently detected by ROSAT. The amplitude of <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>increase</b> (∆U ∼ 7. 3 mag) and the total energy release in the UBV bands (EUBV ∼ (1. 4 ± 0. 3) × 1035 erg) put this event among the strongest flares ever detected on UV Ceti-type stars. The U-B and B-V colours of the flare emission did not significantly change {{during most of the}} flare development. While the B-V is quite a typical colour for stellar flares, the U-B is much bluer when compared with typical values given in literature. This unusually strong ultraviolet component of the flare emission, together with the very fast flare decay, suggest a possible flare site close to the limb. We find that the observed amount of flare energy could be explained by the fast release of energy stored in a magnetic filament located in between the two G 102 - 21 stellar components, with a surface magnetic field ≥ 3600 G. The characteristics of the quiescent optical emission are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Summary-In the {{occupational}} community, {{there is a}} widespread faith in the utility of personality assess-ment for selection, development, etc. This faith has been immune to arguments, supported by empirical evidence, regarding the poor correlation between personality and performance in the workplace (these correlations rarely exceed the 0. 2 - 0. 3 level). The difference between perception of utility and the actual empirical reality is large. We investigated one possible source of this perceived-actual discrepancy. In two separate samples, we compared the magnitude of validity coefficients from individual and aggregate (i. e. organizational) levels. Our results indicated that strong actual personality-performance correlations exist at the aggregate level of analysis, but not at the individual level of analysis. We suggest that this aggregate-individual correlation discrepancy may, in part at least, account for the perceived-actual discrepancy noted above. We conclude that the continued faith in personality testing in the workplace may be a consequence of test users ’ sensitivity to actual aggregate level personality-performance correlations. However, we warn of the danger of drawing inferences from aggregate level correlations when making decisions about individuals. and point out the statistical artefacts that may account for some of <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>increase</b> in aggregate level correlations. Several foci for further research are indicated. 0 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} of this paper will be to investigate advancements and any commonality between spacecraft debris containment and the improvements being made in ballistic protection. Scope: This paper will focus on cross application of protection devices and methods, and how they relate to protecting humans from failures in spacecraft. The potential gain {{is to reduce the}} risk associated with hardware failure, while decreasing the weight and size of energy containment methods currently being used by the government and commercial industry. Method of Approach: This paper will examine testing that has already been accomplished in regards to the failure of high energy rotating hardware and compare it to advancements in ballistic protection. Examples are: DOT research and testing of turbine containment as documented in DOT/FAA/AR- 96 / 110, DOT/FAA/AR- 97 / 82, DOT/FAA/AR- 98 / 22. It will also look at work accomplished by companies such as ApNano and IBD Deisenroth in the development of nano ceramics and nanometric steels. Other forms of energy absorbent materials and composites will also be considered and discussed. New Advances in State of the Art: There have been numerous advances in technology in regards to high energy debris containment and in the similar field of ballistic protection. This paper will discuss methods such as using impregnated or dry Kevlar, ceramic, and nano-technology which have been successfully tested but are yet to be utilized in spacecraft. Reports on tungsten disulfide nanotubes claim that they are 4 - 5 times stronger than steel and reports vary about <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>increase</b> over Kevlar, but it appears to be somewhere in the range of 2 - 6 times stronger.

The slag contains 52. 8 and 2. 2 % (w/w) CaO and MgO, respectively. To {{determine the influence of}} LD slag on the chemical characteristics of three acid soils from Gilan, an incubation study was conducted. The soil samples were collected from 0 - 30 cm of rice and tobacco fields and a tea garden. Treatments were 0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 % (w/w) of converter slag/kg soil. The slag was thoroughly mixed with 500 g soil in plastic pots. Soil moisture content was adjusted to near field capacity and changes in pH, EC and AB-DTPA-extractable Fe, Mn, Zn, P and K were determined at 1, 10, 30 and 60 days. Results showed that soil pH increased with increasing slag rates. Slag increased AB-DTPA-extractable P and Mn, <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>increase</b> depend on the amount of slag applied. However, the effect of slag on AB-DTPA-extractable Fe depended on initial pH, initially decreasing at the pH range of 7. 4 - 8. 5 and then increasing at higher pH levels. Slag decreased AB-DTPA-extractable K especially in highly acid soil. In the present study, soil pH and AB-DTPA-extractable Fe decreased with time, though the effect of incubation time on pH was not significant. The effect of incubation time on AB-DTPA extractable Mn and P was different. Time effect on EC and AB-DTPA-extractable K was not significant. In general, soil chemical characteristics were more affected by slag rates than by incubation time. In conclusion, it seems that converter slag is a suitable amendment for acid soils. It is suggested that the effect of LD converter slag on plant growth and chemical characteristics of acid soils be studied under field conditions...|$|E

Urinary tract-originating ASC specific to each patient's own pathogen or P fimbria were studied in 37 children with PN. The children were examined for recidivism and renal scarring in a 6 -month follow-up study. Pathogen-specific ASC were found in 33 / 37 children, with <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>increasing</b> with age. In contrast to the case for adults, with immunoglobulin A (IgA) dominance, in 18 / 33 cases IgM dominated the response, and this occurred more frequently in infants (63 %) than in older children (30 %). The most vigorous response was found to whole Escherichia coli bacteria (geometric mean, 63 ± 2, 135 ASC/ 106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMC]), yet responses were found to P fimbriae (13 ± 33 ASC/ 106 PBMC), too. The response peaked at 1 to 2 weeks and was low/negligible 3 to 7 weeks after the beginning of symptoms. Recidivism was seen in seven patients, and renal scarring was seen in nine patients. In conclusion, a response of circulating ASC was found in children with UTIs, with <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>increasing</b> with age.
