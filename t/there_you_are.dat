500|$|In every episode, Phineas and Ferb's pet platypus, Perry, disappears {{to carry}} out his job as a secret agent. The kids almost always notice this, asking [...] "Hey, where's Perry?" [...] Then, when Perry comes home, they say, [...] "Oh, <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> Perry!" [...] Discussing Perry, creator Povenmire cited the example of his own pet cat, Sprocket, which he claimed led a [...] "secret life" [...] with his neighbors in order to get extra food.|$|E

500|$|Although his {{appearance}} {{as a domestic}} pet is mostly a cover, Perry has nonetheless expressed care and devotion for the Flynn-Fletcher family. In the episode [...] "The Ballad of Bad Beard", Perry managed to drag Candace out of the Dark Cave before it caved in because of Dr. Doofenshmirthz's [...] "self destruction button" [...] that which Candace had accidentally pressed while under the orange moss hallucination, thinking it was a vending machine. He did this {{even though he knew}} that Candace saw that Perry was a secret agent talking to Agent E (Eagle) and to Major Monogram in a cracked egg. Candace thought she was just hallucinating because of the orange moss she accidentally touched earlier in the episode. Also, when an invention of Doofenshmirtz's in the episode [...] "Journey to the Center of Candace" [...] might cause severe harm to Phineas and Ferb, Perry thoroughly beats up Doofenshmirtz and quickly handcuffs him. He then ties him to a pipe and, instead of just leaving him like he usually does in the series, calls for special forces from the O.W.C.A. to come and arrest the doctor, though they never show up. In [...] "Oh, <b>There</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are,</b> Perry," [...] Doofenshmirtz is downgraded to a low threat level and Perry is reassigned to a new nemesis. This causes him to have to leave his home with the Flynn-Fletchers, which makes him sad and he does not enjoy his new villain. Phineas and Ferb are fearful about where Perry could have gone to and put up several flyers around town for people to find him. They decide to throw a concert on the roof of a building, singing a song about how much they love Perry and want him to come home. Concurrently, Perry is reassigned to Doofenshmirtz again and returns to the brothers once more.|$|E

[...] But in [...] the 8th century BCE prophet Amos condemned {{the sins of the}} people of Israel, saying that they, [...] "come to Bethel and transgress; to Gilgal, and transgress even more: [...] [...] [...] burn a thank offering of leavened bread; and proclaim freewill offerings ( [...] , nedavot) loudly. For you love that sort of thing, O Israelites —declares my Lord God." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{series is}} also known for some of its memorable songs, which have {{appeared}} in almost every episode since the first-season [...] "Flop Starz". Disney's managers particularly enjoyed the episode's song, [...] "Gitchee, Gitchee Goo", and requested that a song appear in each subsequent episode. The show's creators write and record each number, and vary musical tempo depending on each song's dramatic use.

2500|$|When Chauvel {{arrived in}} Damascus, {{he told his}} staff [...] "to pitch my camp in a clean orchard {{just out of the}} city, which I thought would suit me better after what I had seen of the place. I then went back to my camp, had lunch, and became {{immersed}} in problems of supply, collection of prisoners, orders for the morrow, etc., sending off first of all an aeroplane message to Lord Allenby, telling him what I had done." [...] He also sent for the British Supply Officer of the Hejaz Forces. [...] "Before discussing supply matters, however, he ... said 'they are out to make as little as possible of the British and make the populace think that it is the Arabs who have driven out the Turk. This is why Lawrence asked you to keep your men out of the city and they have no intention of asking you for any police.' He also said 'They are getting the British Consulate ready for you. If you go <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not defining yourself as the Conqueror of this country, but rather as a contributory ally. You should take possession of Djemal Pasha's house, which is the best one in the place, and which they are reserving for Feisal.' He said there was absolute chaos in the city, the Bazaars were closed and all the better class of people were terrified at the idea of the Hejaz crowd being in charge." [...] As a result, Chauvel decided to march through the city the following day, with [...] "practically every unit being represented; guns, armoured cars, everything, and I also took possession of Djemal's house." ...|$|E
