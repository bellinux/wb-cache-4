40|$|We {{introduce}} a new property of tile self-assembly systems that we call size-separability. A system is size-separable if every <b>terminal</b> <b>assembly</b> is a constant factor larger than any intermediate assembly. Size-separability is motivated by the practical problem of filtering completed assemblies {{from a variety of}} incomplete "garbage" assemblies using gel electrophoresis or other mass-based filtering techniques. Here we prove that any system without cooperative bonding assembling a unique mismatch-free <b>terminal</b> <b>assembly</b> can be used to construct a size-separable system uniquely assembling the same shape. The proof achieves optimal scale factor and temperature for the size-separable system. As part of the proof, we obtain two results of independent interest on mismatch-free temperature- 1 two-handed systems...|$|E

These particles can be compared in terms of utility, versatility and multifunctionality to other known types of <b>terminal</b> <b>assemblies.</b> They are simple to make and offer theoretical tools for designing their structure and function. To demonstrate such assemblies, we combine cadmium telluride nanoparticles with cyto-chrome C protein and observe spontaneous formation of spherical supraparticles with a narrow size distribution. Such self-limiting behaviour originates from the competition between electrostatic repulsion and non-covalent attractive interactions. Experimental variation of supraparticle diameters for several assembly conditions matches predictions obtained in simulations. Similar to micelles, supraparticles can incorporate other biological components as exemplified by incorporation of nitrate reductase.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{close-packed}} CF 3 -terminated solid surface is among the most hydrophobic surfaces in nature. Molecular dynamic simulations show that this hydrophobicity can be further enhanced by the atomic-scale roughness. Consequently, the hydrophobic gap width is enlarged to about 0. 6 [*]nm for roughened CF 3 -terminated solid surfaces. In contrast, the hydrophobic gap width does not increase too much for a rough CH 3 -terminated solid surface. We show that the CF 3 -terminated surface exists in a microscopic Cassie-Baxter state, whereas the CH 3 -terminated surface exists as a microscopic Wenzel state. This finding elucidates the underlying mechanism for the different widths of the observed hydrophobic gap. The cage structure of the water molecules (with integrated hydrogen bonds) around CH 3 <b>terminal</b> <b>assemblies</b> on the solid surface provides an explanation for the mechanism by which the CH 3 -terminated surface is less hydrophobic than the CF 3 -terminated surface...|$|R

To establish the molecular basis of <b>terminal</b> filament <b>assembly,</b> we have selected the sarcomeric M-band protein myomesin as a prototypic filament model. The crystal structure of the myomesin C-terminus, comprising a tandem array of two immunoglobulin (Ig) domains My 12 and My 13, reveals a dimeric end-to-end filament of 14. 3 nm length.

40|$|The F 1 F 0 -ATP synthase {{translates}} a proton flux {{across the}} inner mitochondrial membrane into a mechanical rotation, driving anhydride bond {{formation in the}} catalytic portion. The complex's membrane-embedded motor forms a proteinaceous channel at the interface between Atp 9 ring and Atp 6. To prevent unrestricted proton flow dissipating the H+-gradient, channel formation is a critical and tightly controlled step during ATP synthase assembly. Here we show that the INA complex (INAC) acts at this decisive step promoting Atp 9 -ring association with Atp 6. INAC binds to newly synthesized mitochondrial-encoded Atp 6 and Atp 8 in complex with maturation factors. INAC association is retained until the F 1 -portion is built on Atp 6 / 8 and loss of INAC causes accumulation of the free F 1. An independent complex is formed between INAC and the Atp 9 ring. We conclude that INAC maintains assembly intermediates of the F 1 F 0 -ATP synthase in a primed state for the <b>terminal</b> <b>assembly</b> step-motor module formation...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} the robust random number generation problem where {{the goal is}} to design an abstract tile assembly system (aTAM system) whose <b>terminal</b> <b>assemblies</b> can be split into n partitions such that a resulting assembly of the system lies within each partition with probability 1 /n, regardless of the relative concentration assignment of the tile types in the system. First, we show this is possible for n= 2 (a robust fair coin flip) within the aTAM, and that such systems guarantee a worst case O(1) space usage. We accompany our primary construction with variants that show trade-offs in space complexity, initial seed size, temperature, tile complexity, bias, and extensibility, and also prove some negative results. As an application, we combine our coin-flip system with a result of Chandran, Gopalkrishnan, and Reif to show that for any positive integer n, there exists a O(n) tile system that assembles a constant-width linear assembly of expected length n for any concentration assignment. We then extend our robust fair coin flip result {{to solve the problem of}} robust random number generation in the aTAM for all n. Two variants of robust random bit generation solutions are presented: an unbounded space solution and a bounded space solution which incurs a small bias. Further, we consider the harder scenario where tile concentrations change arbitrarily at each assembly step and show that while this is not possible in the aTAM, the problem can be solved by exotic tile assembly models from the literature.

40|$|Presynaptic nerve {{terminals}} {{pass through}} distinct stages of maturation after their initial assembly. Here {{we show that}} the postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule Neuroligin 1 regulates key steps of presynaptic maturation. Presynaptic terminals from Neuroligin 1 -knockout mice remain structurally and functionally immature with respect to active zone stability and synaptic vesicle pool size, as analyzed in cultured hippocampal neurons. Conversely, overexpression of Neuroligin 1 in immature neurons, that is within the first 5 days after plating, induced the formation of presynaptic boutons that had hallmarks of mature boutons. In particular, Neuroligin 1 enhanced {{the size of the}} pool of recycling synaptic vesicles, the rate of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, the fraction of boutons responding to depolarization, as well as the responsiveness of the presynaptic release machinery to phorbol ester stimulation. Moreover, Neuroligin 1 induced the formation of active zones that remained stable in the absence of F-actin, another hallmark of advanced maturation. Acquisition of F-actin independence of the active zone marker Bassoon during culture development or induced via overexpression of Neuroligin 1 was activity-dependent. The extracellular domain of Neuroligin 1 was sufficient to induce assembly of functional presynaptic terminals, while the intracellular domain was required for terminal maturation. These data show that induction of presynaptic <b>terminal</b> <b>assembly</b> and maturation involve mechanistically distinct actions of Neuroligins, and that Neuroligin 1 is essential for presynaptic terminal maturation...|$|E
40|$|We {{prove the}} {{computational}} weakness {{of a model}} of tile assembly that has so far resisted many attempts of formal analysis or positive constructions. Specifically, we prove that, in Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly Model, when restricted to use only noncooperative bindings, any long enough path that can grow in all <b>terminal</b> <b>assemblies</b> is pumpable, meaning that this path can be extended into an infinite, ultimately periodic path. This result {{can be seen as}} a geometric generalization of the pumping lemma of finite state automata, and closes the question of what can be computed deterministically in this model. Moreover, this question has motivated the development of a new method called visible glues. We believe that this method can also be used to tackle other long-standing problems in computational geometry, in relation for instance with self-avoiding paths. Tile assembly (including non-cooperative tile assembly) was originally introduced by Winfree and Rothemund in STOC 2000 to understand how to program shapes. The non-cooperative variant, also known as temperature 1 tile assembly, is the model where tiles are allowed to bind as soon as they match on one side, whereas in cooperative tile assembly, some tiles need to match on several sides in order to bind. In this work, we prove that only very simple shapes can indeed be programmed, whereas exactly one known result (SODA 2014) showed a restriction on the assemblies general non-cooperative self-assembly could achieve, without any implication on its computational expressiveness. With non-square tiles (like polyominos, SODA 2015), other recent works have shown that the model quickly becomes computationally powerful.

The key idea is to exploit memristive nanodevice behavior to cheaply implement adaptive, recurrent networks, useful for complex pattern recognition problems.

It evaluates the requirements of VSC and provides a concrete illustration of VSC in the continuous improvement process of a point of sales <b>terminal</b> <b>assembly</b> line. Findings - The paper evidences the possible mistakes of cost accounting. The necessity and validity of VSC in lean manufacturing are presented, followed by a case example. In order to make continuous improvement decisions, VSM, VSC and box score offer complete information on the performance of the value stream. Research limitations/implications - Although accompanied by an application on a real case study, this is not an empirical investigation on the adoption of VSC. Practical implications - VSC requirements agree with the fundamentals of lean management.

40|$|Perhaps the {{two most}} {{significant}} theoretical questions about the programming of self-assembling agents are: (1) necessary and sufficient conditions to produce a unique <b>terminal</b> <b>assembly,</b> and (2) error correction. We address both questions, by reducing two well-studied models of tile assembly to models of distributed shared memory (DSM), {{in order to obtain}} results from the memory consistency systems induced by tile assembly systems when simulated in the DSM setting. The Abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) can be simulated by a DSM system that obeys causal consistency, and the locally deterministic tile assembly systems in the aTAM correspond exactly to the concurrent-write free programs that simulate tile assembly in such a model. Thus, the detection of the failure of local determinism (which had formerly been an open problem) reduces to the detection of data races in simulating programs. Further, the Kinetic Tile Assembly Model can be simulated by a DSM system that obeys GWO, a memory consistency condition defined by Steinke and Nutt. (To our knowledge, this is the first natural example of a DSM system that obeys GWO, but no stronger consistency condition.) We combine these results with the observation that self-assembly algorithms are local algorithms, and there exists a fast conversion of deterministic local algorithms into deterministic self-stabilizing algorithms. This provides an "immediate" generalization of a theorem by Soloveichik et al. about the existence of tile assembly systems that simultaneously perform two forms of self-stabilization: proofreading and self-healing. Our reductions and proof techniques can be extended to the programming of self-assembling agents in a variety of media, not just DNA tiles, and not just two-dimensional surfaces...|$|E

The (abstract) tile assembly model is a mathematical model of self-assembly in which system components are square tiles with different glue types assigned to tile edges. Assembly {{is driven by the}} attachment of singleton tiles to a growing seed assembly when the net force of glue attraction for a tile exceeds some fixed threshold. Within this frame work, we examine the time complexity of computing the sum or product of 2 n-bit numbers, where the input numbers are encoded in an initial seed assembly, and the output is encoded in the final, <b>terminal</b> <b>assembly</b> of the system. We show that the problems of addition and multiplication have worst case lower bounds of Ω(n) in 2 D assembly, and Ω (3 n) in 3 D assembly. In the case of addition, we design algorithms for both 2 D and 3 D that meet this bound with worst case run times of O(n) and O (3 n) respectively, which beats the previous best known upper bound of O(n). Further, we consider average case complexity of addition over uniformly distributed n-bit strings and show how to achieve O(logn) average case time with a simultaneous O(n) worst case run time in 2 D. For multiplication, we present an O(n 5 / 6) time multiplication algorithm which works in 3 D, which beats the previous best known upper bound of O(n). As additional evidence for the speed of our algorithms, we implement our addition algorithms, along with the simpler O(n) time addition algorithm, into a probabilistic run-time simulator and compare the timing results...|$|E

We interpret a well-studied abstraction of nanomolecular self assembly, the Abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), into Computation Tree Logic (CTL), a temporal logic often used in model checking. We then consider the class of "rectilinear" tile assembly systems. This class includes most aTAM systems studied in the theoretical literature, and all (algorithmic) DNA tile self-assembling systems that have been realized in laboratories to date. We present a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a tile assembly system T as input, either provides a counterexample to T's rectilinearity or verifies whether T has a unique <b>terminal</b> <b>assembly.</b> Using partial order reductions, the verification search space for this algorithm is reduced from exponential size to O(n^ 2), where n x n is the size of the assembly surface. That reduction is asymptotically the best possible. We report on experimental results obtained by translating tile assembly simulator files into a Petri net format manipulable by the SMART model checking engines devised by Ciardo et al. The model checker runs in O(|T| x n^ 4) time, where |T| is the number of tile types in tile assembly system T, and n x n is the surface size. Atypical for a model checking problem [...] in which the practical limit usually is insufficient memory to store the state space [...] the limit in this case was the amount of memory required to represent the rules of the model.

40|$|As a {{mathematical}} model of self-assembling systems, Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) is a remarkable platform for studying the behaviors and powers of self-assembling systems. Capable of Turing universal computation, the aTAM allows algorithmic self-assembly, in which the components can be designed so that the rules governing their behaviors force them to inherently execute prescribed algorithms as they combine. Adding to its completeness, the aTAM was shown to also be intrinsically universal, which means that there exists a single tile set such that for any arbitrary input aTAM system, that tile set can be configured into a seed structure which will then cause self-assembly using that tile set to simulate the input system, capturing its full dynamics modulo only a scale factor. However, the universal simulator previously given makes use of nondeterminism in terms of tile types placed in several key locations when different assembly sequences are followed, even when simulating a directed system, meaning one that has exactly one unique <b>terminal</b> <b>assembly.</b> The question then became {{whether or not that}} nondeterminism is fundamentally required. Here, we answer that in the affirmative: the class of directed systems in the aTAM is not intrinsically universal, meaning there is no universal simulator for directed systems which itself is always directed. This provides insight into the role of nondeterminism in self-assembly, which is itself a fundamentally nondeterministic process. To achieve this result we leverage powerful results of computational complexity hierarchies, including tight bounds on both best and worst-case complexities of decidable languages, to design systems with precisely controllable space resources available to embedded computations. We also develop novel techniques for designing systems containing subsystems with disjoint, mutually exclusive computational powers.

Despite the geodynamic significance of these suture zones, few modern petrological and geochronological data are available from these ophiolitic domains, hampering a full assessment of the timing, thermobaric regimes and palaeotectonic scenarios leading to oceanic suturing and continental assembly in Iran and, more in general, along the southern margin of Eurasia. In this paper, we describe a newly discovered HP ophiolite mélange within the Rasht ophiolites, at the NW termination of the Palaeo-Tethyan suture in Iran. Petrological investigations on the metamorphic units embedded within the ophiolite mélange are integrated with whole-rock geochemistry and Ar–Ar phengite geochronology to constrain the geotectonic setting of formation and to define the associated P–T–t paths. We provide evidence that the Rasht ophiolite domain corresponds to an exhumed subduction complex formed during Early Carboniferous (c. 350  Ma) subduction of a branch of the Palaeo-Tethyan oceanic realm, with peak metamorphism equilibrated under blueschist- to eclogite-facies metamorphic conditions. Implications of these data for the palaeotectonic reconstruction during closure of the Palaeo-Tethyan ocean and the <b>terminal</b> collisional <b>assembly</b> along the southern margin of the Eurasia plate are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The human {{pathogen}} Mycoplasma genitalium {{is known to}} mediate cell adhesion to target cells by the attachment organelle, a complex structure also implicated in gliding motility. The gliding mechanism of M. genitalium cells is completely unknown, but recent studies have begun to elucidate {{the components of the}} gliding machinery. We report the study of MG 312, a cytadherence-related protein containing in the N terminus a box enriched in aromatic and glycine residues (EAGR), which is also exclusively found in MG 200 and MG 386 gliding motility proteins. Characterization of an MG_ 312 deletion mutant obtained by homologous recombination has revealed that the MG 312 protein is required for the assembly of the M. genitalium terminal organelle. This finding is consistent with the intermediate-cytadherence phenotype and the complete absence of gliding motility exhibited by this mutant. Reintroduction of several MG_ 312 deletion derivatives into the MG_ 312 null mutant allowed us to identify two separate functional domains: an N-terminal domain implicated in gliding motility and a C-terminal domain involved in cytadherence and <b>terminal</b> organelle <b>assembly</b> functions. In addition, our results also provide evidence that the EAGR box has a specific contribution to mycoplasma cell motion. Finally, the presence of a conserved ATP binding site known as a Walker A box in the MG 312 N-terminal region suggests that this structural protein could also play an active function in the gliding mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the forensic {{analysis of what}} the authors {{believe to be the}} most sophisticated smart card fraud encountered to date. In 2010, Murdoch et al. [7] described a man-in-the-middle attack against EMV cards. [7] demonstrated the attack using a general purpose FPGA board, noting that “miniaturization is mostly a mechanical challenge, and well within the expertise of criminal gangs”. This indeed happened in 2011, when about 40 sophisticated card forgeries surfaced in the field. These forgeries are remarkable in that they embed two chips wired top-to-tail. The first chip is clipped from a genuine stolen card. The second chip plays the role of the man-in-the-middle and communicates directly with the point of sale (PoS) <b>terminal.</b> The entire <b>assembly</b> is embedded in the plastic body of yet another stolen card. The forensic analysis relied on X-ray chip imaging, side-channel analysis, protocol analysis, and microscopic optical inspections. ...|$|R
40|$|Cellulose, a microfibrillar {{polysaccharide}} {{consisting of}} bundles of β- 1, 4 -glucan chains, {{is a major}} component of plant and most algal cell walls and is also synthesized by some prokaryotes. Seed plants and bacteria differ in the structures of their membrane terminal complexes that make cellulose and, in turn, control the dimensions of the microfibrils produced. They also differ in the domain structures of their CesA gene products (the catalytic subunit of cellulose synthase), which have been localized to terminal complexes and appear to help maintain terminal complex structure. Terminal complex structures in algae range from rosettes (plant-like) to linear forms (bacterium-like). Thus, algal CesA genes may reveal domains that control <b>terminal</b> complex <b>assembly</b> and microfibril structure. The CesA genes from the alga Mesotaenium caldariorum, a member of the order Zygnematales, which have rosette terminal complexes, are remarkably similar to seed plant CesAs, with deduced amino acid sequence identities of up to 59 %. In addition to the putative transmembrane helices and the D-D-D-QXXRW motif shared by all known CesA gene products, M. caldariorum and seed plant CesAs share a region conserved among plants, an N-terminal zinc-binding domain, and a variable or class-specific region. This indicates that the domains that characterize seed plant CesAs arose prior to the evolution of land plants and {{may play a role in}} maintaining the structures of rosette terminal complexes. The CesA genes identified in M. caldariorum are the first reported for any eukaryotic alga and will provide a basis for analyzing the CesA genes of algae with different types of terminal complexes...|$|R
