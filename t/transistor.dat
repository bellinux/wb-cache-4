5|$|Rise Against {{was formed}} in 1999 after the {{dissolution}} of the Chicago punk rock band 88 Fingers Louie. Bassist Joe Principe and guitarist Dan Wleklinski were still interested in making music, and decided to start a new band. The two recruited drummer Toni Tintari, guitarist Kevin White, and lead vocalist Tim McIlrath, the former lead vocalist of the punk band Baxter. They called themselves <b>Transistor</b> Revolt, and released the extended play <b>Transistor</b> Revolt in 2000. <b>Transistor</b> Revolt garnered the attention of Fat Mike, the co-founder of the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords. He signed the band to a recording contract in 2000, with the stipulation that they change their name; the band members ultimately decided on Rise Against.|$|E
5|$|Controller {{advances}} have exploited dramatic {{increases in the}} voltage and current ratings and switching frequency of solid-state power devices {{over the past six}} decades. Introduced in 1983, the insulated-gate bipolar <b>transistor</b> (IGBT) has {{in the past two decades}} come to dominate VFDs as an inverter switching device.|$|E
5|$|Electronic devices {{make use}} of the <b>transistor,</b> {{perhaps one of the most}} {{important}} inventions of the twentieth century, and a fundamental building block of all modern circuitry. A modern integrated circuit may contain several billion miniaturised transistors in a region only a few centimetres square.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} diffusion <b>transistors</b> were diffused-base <b>transistors.</b> These <b>transistors</b> {{still had}} alloy emitters and sometimes alloy collectors like the earlier alloy-junction <b>transistors.</b> Only the base was diffused into the substrate. Sometimes the substrate formed the collector, but in <b>transistors</b> like Philco's micro-alloy diffused <b>transistors</b> the substrate was {{the bulk of}} the base.|$|R
50|$|The first planar <b>transistors</b> {{had much}} worse {{characteristics}} than alloy junction <b>transistors</b> of the period, {{but as they}} could be mass-produced and alloy junction <b>transistors</b> could not, they cost much less and the characteristics of planar <b>transistors</b> improved very rapidly, quickly exceeding those of all earlier <b>transistors</b> and making earlier <b>transistors</b> obsolete.|$|R
40|$|Test data of {{switching}} times characterization of bipolar <b>transistors,</b> of field effect <b>transistor's</b> {{switching times}} on-resistance and characterization, comparative data of field effect <b>transistors,</b> and test data of field effect <b>transistor's</b> parallel operation characterization are given. Data {{is given in}} the form of graphs...|$|R
5|$|In 1948 Shive {{invented the}} {{phototransistor}} that used {{a beam of}} light, instead of a wire, as the emitter of a point contact <b>transistor,</b> generating holes that flow to the collector. It was not announced until 1950. This invention embodies the modern day nationwide direct distance dialing system.|$|E
5|$|After {{signing with}} Fat Wreck Chords, Tintari and White left the band. The {{remaining}} members then {{spent the next}} few months looking for another drummer capable of playing double-time beats at a rapid pace. During this period, the band Good Riddance found their new drummer, and sent Rise Against the audition tape of their number two choice, Brandon Barnes. A mutual friend gave Barnes' phone number to Principe, and after listening to <b>Transistor</b> Revolt, Barnes accepted the band's invitation.|$|E
5|$|Electrons are {{important}} in cathode ray tubes, which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and television sets. In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse. Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and they {{played a critical role}} in the development of electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by solid-state devices such as the <b>transistor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Researchers {{have made}} {{several kinds of}} {{flexible}} <b>transistors,</b> including organic field-effect <b>transistors.</b> Flexible <b>transistors</b> are useful in some kinds of flexible displays and other flexible electronics.|$|R
50|$|Originally, MMICs used MEtal-Semiconductor Field-Effect <b>Transistors</b> (MESFETs) as {{the active}} device. More {{recently}} High Electron Mobility <b>Transistors</b> (HEMTs), Pseudomorphic HEMTs and Heterojunction Bipolar <b>Transistors</b> have become common.|$|R
50|$|AOI and OAI gates can {{be readily}} {{implemented}} in CMOS circuitry. AOI gates are particularly advantaged in that {{the total number of}} <b>transistors</b> (or gates) is less than if the AND, NOT, and OR functions were implemented separately. This results in increased speed, reduced power, smaller area, and potentially lower fabrication cost. For example, a 2-1 AOI gate can be constructed with 6 <b>transistors</b> in CMOS compared to 10 <b>transistors</b> using a 2-input NAND gate (4 <b>transistors),</b> an inverter (2 <b>transistors),</b> and a 2-input NOR gate (4 <b>transistors).</b>|$|R
5|$|For the 1965 Formula One season, Rindt {{signed as}} a {{permanent}} driver with Cooper, paired with Bruce McLaren. He was not immediately successful as Cooper, formerly a top team, were struggling at the time. In his first race, the 1965 South African Grand Prix, he developed <b>transistor</b> trouble; the damage was initially repaired but the problem recurred and Rindt had to retire from the race. His best result was a fourth place at the German Grand Prix at the NÃ¼rburgring. He ended the season with four points, 13th in the championship.|$|E
5|$|MRO's main {{computer}} is a 133MHz, 10.4million <b>transistor,</b> 32-bit, RAD750 processor. This processor is a radiation-hardened {{version of a}} PowerPC 750 or G3 processor with a specially built motherboard. The RAD750 is a successor to the RAD6000. This processor may seem underpowered in comparison to a modern PC processor, but it is extremely reliable, resilient, and can function in solar flare-ravaged deep space. The operating system software is VxWorks and has extensive fault protection protocols and monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Problems {{with the}} {{reliability}} of early batches of transistors meant that the machine's {{mean time between failures}} was about 90 minutes, which improved once the more reliable junction transistors became available. The <b>Transistor</b> Computer's design was adopted by the local engineering firm of Metropolitan-Vickers in their Metrovick 950, in which all the circuitry was modified to make use of junction transistors. Six Metrovick 950s were built, the first completed in 1956. They were successfully deployed within various departments of the company and were in use for about five years.|$|E

30|$|The {{complementary}} CMOS (C-CMOS) {{full adder}} [7] has 28 <b>transistors</b> and composed of p-channel MOS (PMOS) <b>transistors</b> as a pull-up network and n-channel MOS (NMOS) <b>transistors</b> as a pull-down network. The voltage levels of this full adder are full swing, {{but the number}} of <b>transistors</b> of this full adder is high.|$|R
40|$|An {{operational}} amplifier including: a differential pair of <b>transistors</b> coupled {{to a pair}} of input signals; and a pair of floating-gate <b>transistors</b> coupled to the differential pair of <b>transistors,</b> wherein the pair of floating-gate <b>transistors</b> are operable for reducing an offset voltage of the {{operational amplifier}}. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R
5|$|Technical {{difficulties}} {{included the}} very high <b>transistor</b> counts needed to support the wide instruction words and the large caches. There were also structural problems within the project, as the {{two parts of the}} joint team used different methodologies and had slightly different priorities. Since Merced was the first EPIC processor, the development effort encountered more unanticipated problems than the team was accustomed to. In addition, the EPIC concept depends on compiler capabilities that had never been implemented before, so more research was needed.|$|E
5|$|The T series, {{produced}} from 1968 to 1975, {{was the last}} of the tonewheel spinet organs. Unlike all the earlier Hammond organs, which used vacuum tubes for preamplification, amplification, percussion and chorus-vibrato control, the T series used all-solid-state, <b>transistor</b> circuitry, though, unlike the L-100, it did include the scanner-vibrato as seen on the B-3. Other than the T-100 series models, all other T-Series models included a built-in rotating Leslie speaker and some included an analog drum machine, while the T-500 also included a built-in cassette recorder. It {{was one of the last}} tonewheel Hammonds produced.|$|E
5|$|The Unraveling is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band Rise Against. It was {{released}} on April 24, 2001. Following the release of their first extended play <b>Transistor</b> Revolt in 2000, the band signed with the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords, and began working on an album at Sonic Iguana Studios. Recording took place {{over the course of}} five weeks with producer Mass Giorgini. Musically, The Unraveling is rooted in melodic hardcore, with lyrical themes that include friendships, relationships, and memories.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{units used}} germanium <b>transistors.</b> Silicon <b>transistors</b> {{were used in}} later editions of the pedal. Silicon <b>transistors</b> provided for a more stable operation, but have a different, harsher sound.|$|R
40|$|Direct-etched HfO 2 /TaN nMOS <b>transistors</b> were fabricated. The {{performance}} of the <b>transistors</b> with aggressively scaled EOT is comparable or better than that of SiO 2 /poly <b>transistors.</b> The performance enhancement requires a combination of EOT scaling and an appropriate interface layer control. The {{performance of}} the direct-etched TaN gated HfO 2 based <b>transistors</b> is also compared {{to the performance of}} similar TaN gated SiON based <b>transistors.</b> It is observed that for equal g(m) the leakage is lower for HfO 2 based <b>transistors,</b> despite the lower EOT for the HfO 2 based devices.

5|$|The {{development}} of the germanium <b>transistor</b> in 1948 {{opened the door to}} countless applications of solid state electronics. From 1950 through the early 1970s, this area provided an increasing market for germanium, but then high-purity silicon began replacing germanium in transistors, diodes, and rectifiers. For example, the company that became Fairchild Semiconductor was founded in 1957 with the express purpose of producing silicon transistors. Silicon has superior electrical properties, but it requires much greater purity that could not be commercially achieved {{in the early years of}} semiconductor electronics.|$|E
5|$|The {{solid-state}} device came {{into its own}} with {{the invention of the}} <b>transistor</b> in 1947. Common {{solid-state device}}s include transistors, microprocessor chips, and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash drives and more recently, solid-state drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard disk drives. Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes, transistors, integrated circuit (IC) and the light-emitting diode (LED).|$|E
5|$|Whether it {{involved}} {{the history of}} the number zero or the invention of the <b>transistor,</b> two things stood out to me. First is that the discovery {{that turns out to be}} the most valuable is usually dismissed as a side-effect. Second is that prototypes almost never include neon lights and chrome. I wanted to see a story play out that was more in line with the way real innovation takes place than I had seen on film before.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{progress}} in photoactive organic field-effect <b>transistors</b> (OFETs) is reviewed. Photoactive OFETs {{are divided into}} light-emitting (LE) and light-receiving (LR) OFETs. In the first part, LE-OFETs are reviewed {{from the viewpoint of}} the evolution of device structures. Device performances have improved in the last decade with the evolution of device structures from single-layer unipolar to multi-layer ambipolar <b>transistors.</b> In the second part, various kinds of LR-OFETs are featured. These are categorized according to their functionalities: phototransistors, non-volatile optical memories, and photochromism-based <b>transistors.</b> For both, various device configurations are introduced: thin-film based <b>transistors</b> for practical applications, single-crystalline <b>transistors</b> to investigate fundamental physics, nanowires, multi-layers, and vertical <b>transistors</b> based on new concepts...|$|R
50|$|The second {{aspect of}} {{nanocircuit}} organization is interconnection. This involves logical and mathematical operations and the wires linking the <b>transistors</b> together {{that make this}} possible. In nanocircuits, nanotubes and other wires as narrow as one nanometer are used to link <b>transistors</b> together. Nanowires have been made from carbon nanotubes for a few years. Until a few years ago, <b>transistors</b> and nanowires were put together to produce the circuit. However, scientists {{have been able to}} produce a nanowire with <b>transistors</b> in it. In 2004, Harvard University nanotech pioneer Charles Lieber and his team have made a nanowireâ10,000 times thinner than a sheet of paperâthat contains a string of <b>transistors.</b> Essentially, <b>transistors</b> and nanowires are already pre-wired so as to eliminate the difficult task of trying to connect <b>transistors</b> together with nanowires.|$|R
50|$|Early {{units used}} NKT275 {{germanium}} <b>transistors.</b> Later on, BC183L, BC183KA, BC130C, BC108C, BC209C and BC239C silicon <b>transistors</b> were used. The American made versions used BC109C <b>transistors.</b> Arbiter reissues used AC128s. Hendrix also {{switched to the}} silicon <b>transistors,</b> but they created additional difficulties on stage, since {{they are much more}} susceptible to receiving AM radio signals, which were then audible through the guitar amplifier.|$|R
5|$|While Kilburn led one {{design team}} working on Meg, he led another with Dick Grimsdale and Douglas Webb, on a {{research}} project examining what he believed {{would be the next}} step forward in computer design: the use of transistors. The 48-bit machine they completed in November 1953 was the world's first <b>transistor</b> computer, with 550 diodes and 92 transistors, and was manufactured by STC. An improved version completed in April 1955 had 1,300 diodes and 200 transistors, and was sold by Metropolitan-Vickers as the Metrovick 950.|$|E

5|$|Transparent {{thin-film}} <b>transistors</b> (TTFT) can {{be produced}} with ZnO. As field-effect <b>transistors,</b> they even may not need a pân junction, thus avoiding the p-type doping problem of ZnO. Some of the field-effect <b>transistors</b> even use ZnO nanorods as conducting channels.|$|R
25|$|The <b>transistors</b> Q3, Q4 help to {{increase}} the reverse VBE rating: the base-emitter junctions of the NPN <b>transistors</b> Q1 and Q2 break down at around 7V, but the PNP <b>transistors</b> Q3 and Q4 have VBE breakdown voltages around 50 V.|$|R
