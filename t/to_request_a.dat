5|$|As the fog lifted, Castañeda sent Smither <b>to</b> <b>request</b> <b>a</b> {{meeting between}} the two commanders. Smither was {{promptly}} arrested by the Texians, who were suspicious of his presence among the Mexican soldiers. Nevertheless, Moore agreed to meet Castañeda. Moore explained that his followers no longer recognized the centralist government of Santa Anna and instead remained faithful to the Constitution of 1824, which Santa Anna had repudiated. Castañeda revealed that he shared their federalist leanings, {{but that he was}} honor-bound to follow orders.|$|E
5|$|Cubitt {{turned down}} the {{opportunity}} of a staff posting on the Western Front <b>to</b> <b>request</b> <b>a</b> front-line command, and briefly commanded the 8th (Service) Battalion, Lincolnshire Regimeht in early 1917 before assuming command of the 57th Brigade in April. The brigade saw service at Messines and Ypres in 1917, and in the Spring Offensive of early 1918. He was then appointed to take command of the 38th (Welsh) Division in late May or early June 1918, after its previous General Officer Commanding (GOC), Major General Charles Blackader, had fallen ill.|$|E

5|$|In December 1916, Tinker became {{part-owner}} of the Columbus Senators of the American Association, with Thomas E. Wilson {{serving as}} the principal owner. The duo paid $65,000 for 75% ownership of the team. Tinker also served as the team's manager. He allowed Grover Hartley to succeed him as manager in 1919 and chose Bill Clymer to manage the team for the 1920 season, leading Hartley <b>to</b> <b>request</b> <b>a</b> trade.|$|E
5|$|In the off-season, he was re-signed by the Canucks on 8 August 1996. Näslund {{switched}} his jersey number back to 19 {{from his}} time with Modo, as Hunter left the team. In his first full campaign with the Canucks, he recorded 21goals and 41points over 78games. The Canucks failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs that season; they would not return to the post-season until 2001. At the start of the 1997–98season, Canucks head coach Mike Keenan scratched a healthy Näslund, prompting him <b>to</b> <b>request</b> <b>a</b> trade once again. He finished the year with 14 goals and 34 points over 76 games.|$|E
5|$|Rockets owner Leslie Alexander {{first began}} <b>to</b> <b>request</b> <b>a</b> new arena in 1995, and {{attempted}} to release the Rockets from their lease at The Summit, which ran until 2003. However, he was denied by arena owner Chuck Watson, then-owner of the Aeros, who also wanted control of a new arena. The two sides agreed to equal control over an arena in a deal signed in 1997, but the proposal was rejected by city voters in a 1999 referendum. It {{was not until the}} city and the Rockets signed an amended agreement in 2001, excluding the Aeros, that the proposal was accepted.|$|E

5|$|The game {{makes use}} of the Nintendo 3DS' Play Coin and StreetPass systems. Play Coins can be used <b>to</b> <b>request</b> <b>a</b> tip from Hint Ghosts that are located at points of interest. If another system that has played the game is passed by via StreetPass, a shadow version of their Link will appear somewhere on the field. Players can fight against these Links, which are AI-controlled opponents based on their game's data. Winning against Shadow Links earns a rupee bounty based on their difficulty, and {{achievements}} can be earned for fulfilling certain conditions. A more challenging Hero mode is unlocked upon completing the main adventure.|$|E
5|$|Amir's brigade {{began to}} reach the plain between Artillery Road and the Firdan bridge at 09:00. So far no Egyptian {{resistance}} of any significance had been encountered. The brigade had the objective of attacking 2nd Division's bridgehead. Abu Sa'ada, the division commander, had the 24th Armored Brigade as the divisional reserve, but he could only commit it {{in case of an}} Israeli penetration. Gonen wanted Adan {{to reach the}} Hizayon strongpoint, and contacted Elazar in Tel Aviv at 09:55 <b>to</b> <b>request</b> <b>a</b> crossing of the canal. Gonen either downplayed or ignored negative reports and only told Elazar of positive developments. Elazar, who was at a meeting, communicated with Gonen through his assistant and approved of a crossing, also giving permission for Sharon's division to move south.|$|E
5|$|Another event which {{attracted}} {{much debate}} was the Supreme Court's annulment of the 1946 war crimes conviction of Gregorij Rožman. Rožman was the Catholic bishop of Ljubljana {{who had been}} found guilty of war crimes and treason during World War II {{as a result of}} his collaboration with Italian and German occupation forces. Several attempts during the 1990s to review the trial had failed. This had led to Janša's government changing the law, enabling the religious communities <b>to</b> <b>request</b> <b>a</b> review of trials of their deceased members, something which had previously been reserved only for close relatives. After the Archdiocese of Ljubljana initiated the review, the Supreme Court annulled the 1946 trial on procedural grounds, effectively rehabilitating Rožman, a decision that caused much controversy. This proved harmful for Peterle's campaign, as he was closely associated with the Catholic Church. When asked about the Rožman case in a TV debate, Peterle confined himself to remarking that he was a supporter of the rule of law, that the war had divided the nation and that Rožman had played some part in that.|$|E

5|$|Governor Desha's {{reputation}} was further tarnished {{because of a}} pardon issued to his son. On November 2, 1824, Isaac B. Desha had brutally murdered Francis Baker, a Mississippian who was visiting Kentucky. On November 24, 1824, John Rowan, one of the governor's allies in the General Assembly, introduced legislation ordering the Fleming County Circuit Court to convene a special session on January 17, 1825, for Isaac Desha's trial and providing that the accused should have the option <b>to</b> <b>request</b> <b>a</b> change of venue to Harrison County at that time. Miles {{from the scene of}} the murder, Harrison County was the governor's home county, and he possessed a great deal of influence with officials there. Governor Desha appeared before the legislative committee considering the bill on November 26 and asked that they report it favorably to the full legislature. This was done, and the bill was approved on December 4, 1824.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Julian {{had written}} to the Glidden Company, a {{supplier}} of soybean oil products, <b>to</b> <b>request</b> <b>a</b> five-gallon sample of the oil to use as his {{starting point for the}} synthesis of human steroidal sex hormones (in part because his wife was suffering from infertility). After receiving the request, W. J. O'Brien, a vice-president at Glidden, made a telephone call to Julian, offering him the position of director of research at Glidden's Soya Products Division in Chicago. He was very likely offered the job by O'Brien because he was fluent in German, and Glidden had just purchased a modern continuous countercurrent solvent extraction plant from Germany for the extraction of vegetable oil from soybeans for paints and other uses.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March, {{the vote}} on the second reading {{attracted}} a record 608 members, including the non-voting Speaker (the previous record was 530 members). Despite the high attendance, the second reading was approved by only one vote, and further progress on the Reform Bill was difficult. During the committee stage, Isaac Gascoyne put forward a motion objecting to provisions of the bill that reduced {{the total number of}} seats in the House of Commons. This motion was carried, against the government's wishes, by 8 votes. Thereafter, the ministry lost a vote on a procedural motion by 22 votes. As these divisions indicated that Parliament was against the Reform Bill, the ministry decided <b>to</b> <b>request</b> <b>a</b> dissolution and take its appeal to the people.|$|E

5|$|Paulinus {{was active}} {{not only in}} Deira, which was Edwin's powerbase, but also in Bernicia and Lindsey. Edwin planned {{to set up a}} {{northern}} archbishopric at York, following Gregory the Great's plan for two archdioceses in Britain. Both Edwin and Eadbald sent to Rome <b>to</b> <b>request</b> <b>a</b> pallium for Paulinus, which was sent in July 634. Many of the East Angles, whose king, Eorpwald appears to have converted to Christianity, were also converted by the missionaries. Following Edwin's death in battle, in either 633 or 634, Paulinus returned to Kent with Edwin's widow and daughter. Only one member of Paulinus' group stayed behind, James the Deacon. After Justus' departure from Northumbria, a new king, Oswald, invited missionaries from the Irish monastery of Iona, who worked to convert the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The game is set {{during a}} fictional war in Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, {{in which both}} sides use nuclear and {{chemical}} weapons against each other. The main objective {{of the game is}} to fight conventional battles in continental Europe, whilst trying to avoid a worldwide nuclear holocaust. Throughout the game, various capital cities and their civilian populations will be destroyed by nuclear weapons; the game will only end once either side is forced to surrender or if the entire population of Europe perishes. In order <b>to</b> <b>request</b> <b>a</b> nuclear strike, the player was required to call a dedicated telephone number, which led to an automated message announcing the authorisation code.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} {{picked up}} again on 2 October, when a JNA tank-and-infantry attack on Nadinthe northernmost point of ZNG {{resistance in the}} Zadar areawas repelled. On 3 October, the Yugoslav Navy reinstated its Adriatic blockade. That day, the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps ordered a new push towards Zadar to relieve the city's JNA barracks, destroy the ZNG (or drive it from the city) and capture the Port of Zadar in the city centre. The attacking force was augmented by the 1st Battalion of the 592nd Mechanised Brigade. The offensive began at 13:00 on 4 October, supported by artillery, naval and air forces. The besieged JNA garrisons in the city, except for the Šepurine barracks garrison, also provided mortar and sniper support. The 271st Light Artillery Regiment and the 60th Medium Self-Propelled Missile Regiment of the Yugoslav Air Defence, based in Šepurine, broke through the Croatian siege and joined the advancing JNA force. Although the ZNG and the police held the city and inflicted many casualties, by the night of 4–5 October Zadar was besieged by the JNA; this forced the Croatian authorities <b>to</b> <b>request</b> <b>a</b> cease-fire and negotiations.|$|E
