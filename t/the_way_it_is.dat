Opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side, and often offer significant economic benefits.|$|E
5|$|The CSF {{is derived}} from blood plasma and is largely similar to it, except that CSF is nearly protein-free {{compared}} with plasma and has some different electrolyte levels.

5|$|Although not well-studied, {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} of three species of Malagasy hippopotamus. It is not known when or exactly how these hippos arrived {{on the island of}} Madagascar. As hippos are semi-aquatic, it is possible that they survived the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably when the water was shallower and there were perhaps small islands along <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> possible that the three species of hippopotamus represent three distinct and successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic ungulates ever to have lived on Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|Lithium {{naturally}} only {{occurs in}} traces in biological systems {{and has no}} known biological role, but does have effects on the body when ingested. Lithium carbonate {{is used as a}} mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder (manic-depression) in daily doses of about 0.5 to 2grams, although there are side-effects. Excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness, slurred speech and vomiting, among other symptoms, and poisons the central nervous system, which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage. Its biochemistry, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element, although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified.|$|E

25|$|One {{characteristic}} of media markets is the multidimensional competition. Media enterprises operate {{in three different}} markets.

25|$|Within {{the context}} of Spinoza's {{philosophical}} system, the PSR can be understood to unify causation and explanation. What {{this means is that}} for Spinoza, questions regarding the reason why a given phenomenon is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> (or exists) are always answerable, and are always answerable in terms of the relevant cause(s). This constitutes a rejection of teleological, or final causation, except possibly in a more restricted sense for human beings. Given this, Spinoza's views regarding causality and modality begin to make much more sense.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} the United Kingdom {{has not always been}} <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> today. During some periods it was much warmer and in others it was much colder.

During this period the temperature was so low that much of the surrounding ocean froze and a great ice sheet extended over all of the United Kingdom except the south of England (connected to mainland Europe via the dry English Channel) and southern coastal areas of Wales.|$|E

50|$|Lucky Man is not {{performed}} in concert <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> recorded.

Now we come out and people want to hear it. Greg performs it as an acoustic piece and I guess it's rather disappointing to some people because they want to hear the recorded version. There we were, in the position of <b>it</b> having <b>been</b> released and us not knowing that people want to hear <b>it,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> done on <b>the</b> album being impossible for us to do on stage.|$|R
