A fourth group of lots was for track work.|$|E

5|$|In 1959, Legislative Route 279 was {{designated}} as a highway from La Jolla to Santee and incorporated into the California Freeway and Expressway System.

5|$|In the 1970s, {{the price}} of raccoon pelts rose again {{to a high of}} 25 to 30 dollars each, and some people made their entire income from coon hunting. It was {{possible}} to catch ten raccoons per night in well-populated areas, with good dogs. One outdoors writer estimated that in 1985 there were 30 to 40 thousand coon hunters in Michigan alone. This market hunting largely died out by the late 1980s, and it is estimated that during the fur boom trapping <b>took</b> <b>more</b> raccoons than hunting with dogs.|$|E

At season's end, he was rewarded with selection for Australia's non-Test tour of New Zealand in February and March 1957. The hosts had Test status at the time, but Australia refused to ratify games against their trans-Tasman neighbours as Test matches, citing the weakness of the New Zealand team.|$|E

5|$|Recorded in Los Angeles with {{producer}} David Schiffman, {{the album}} was initially released on October 20, 2009, by Indica Records in Canada.

As the band <b>took</b> <b>more</b> progressive rock influences and applied them to their songwriting, they changed their lyrical focus and wrote about themes considered to be more unusual for rock music, such as film and television characters, for this album.|$|E
