5|$|An initial UN counteroffensive out of Masan proved {{ineffective}} in stopping the North Koreans from advancing. In the subsequent fight, the 35th Infantry {{was able to}} repel the North Koreans at the Battle of Nam River and were highly regarded for <b>these</b> <b>actions.</b> However, the 24th Infantry performed very poorly at the battles of Blue Mountain and Haman, forcing the 25th Division to muster reserves to counter the North Korean gains against the 24th.|$|E
5|$|Brooke's {{character}} is strongly driven by {{his desire to}} break from conventions. Brooke's unconventional actions are common throughout the novel, the most prominent being nude bathing and odd remarks and humour. <b>These</b> <b>actions</b> create an externally carefree individual that is in strong contrast to the down-to-earth Nell.|$|E
5000|$|An action figure {{line was}} {{released}} {{after the events}} and during the events of Arkham City and Arkham Asylum, which are still continuing now from 2009 to whenever the figures are ending.

5000|$|Sonata Theory {{understands the}} rhetorical layout of a sonata as {{progressing}} through {{a set of}} action spaces and moments of [...] "structural punctuation." [...] <b>These</b> <b>action</b> spaces largely correlate with the [...] "themes" [...] or [...] "groups" [...] of the sonata, though each space is differentiated primarily by the unique generic goal that the music pursues within that particular space. The exposition lays out each space, establishing a rotational order which the recapitulation also follows. Frequently the development will only articulate a subset of <b>these</b> <b>action</b> spaces, moving only through a partial rotation, although fully rotational, entirely episodic, and non-rotational developments also occur.|$|R
5|$|During 27–28 August, at Montélimar, Murphy and the 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, {{along with}} the 36th Infantry Division, engaged in an {{offensive}} battle to secure the area from the Germans. The 3rd and 36th Divisions took 500 prisoners in the city on 29 August. For <b>these</b> <b>actions</b> the 1st Battalion of the 15th Infantry Regiment received the Presidential Unit Citation.|$|E
5|$|During their {{retreat from}} Quebec, the Americans {{carefully}} took or destroyed all ships on Lake Champlain that might prove {{useful to the}} British. When Arnold and his troops, making up the rear guard of the army, abandoned Fort Saint-Jean, they burned or sank all the boats they could not use, and {{set fire to the}} sawmill and the fort. <b>These</b> <b>actions</b> effectively denied the British any hope of immediately moving onto the lake.|$|E
5|$|Early on 10 April, Nikolić {{left his}} post and visited the senior Ustaše leader Slavko Kvaternik in Zagreb. He then {{returned}} to the headquarters, and announced that talks with the Germans for an armistice has started {{and that there was no}} longer any need for action. He also redirected 4th Army units around Zagreb to either cease operations or to deploy to innocuous positions. <b>These</b> <b>actions</b> reduced or eliminated armed resistance to the German advance.|$|E

5|$|Early on 10 April, Pukovnik Franjo Nikolić, {{the head}} of the {{operations}} staff with the headquarters of the 1st Army Group, left his post and visited the senior Ustaše leader Slavko Kvaternik in Zagreb. He then returned to headquarters and redirected 4th Army units around Zagreb to either cease operations or to deploy to innocuous positions. <b>These</b> <b>actions</b> reduced or eliminated armed resistance to the German advance.|$|E
5|$|In the ONA's terminology, {{the terms}} Drecc and Niner refer to folk-based or gang-based culture or {{individuals}} {{who support the}} Order's aims by practical (including criminal) means rather than esoteric ones. One such group is the White Star Acception, who claim to have perpetrated rapes, assaults, and robberies in order to advance the group's power; Sieg noted that the reality of <b>these</b> <b>actions</b> has not been verified.|$|E
5|$|Nunn {{oversaw the}} entry of the University of Louisville into the state's public {{university}} system. Fulfilling a campaign promise, he helped transform Northern Kentucky Community College into Northern Kentucky State College (which later became Northern Kentucky University), a four-year institution {{and member of the}} state university system. Historian Lowell H. Harrison argued that <b>these</b> <b>actions</b> diluted state support to existing higher education institutions. Nunn also supported the newly created Kentucky Educational Television.|$|E

Detecting two trawlers they engaged them leaving one on fire, but as they withdrew MGB 77 was hit, killing Hichens outright and wounding three others on the bridge. Hichens received a posthumous MID for <b>these</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Infantry Division {{then moved}} to the offensive, in early May 1951 {{they were used to}} scout for Chinese {{concentrations}} and then call in artillery to destroy them. <b>These</b> <b>actions</b> have been viewed by historians as one of few instances where Rangers in Korea were effectively employed, used as a stealthy infiltration force for terrain too difficult for conventional units.|$|E
5|$|The Ex-Students' Union is the school's alumnae association, inaugurated on {{the evening}} of 9 December 1905. At the {{invitation}} of Dr. Marden several former students discussed the proposal, elected Marion Pickard (who was at that time Lady Superintendent) as their President, and formed a committee to produce a constitution. <b>These</b> <b>actions</b> were confirmed at a General Meeting on Jersey Day 1906, and the committee took office until 1907.|$|E

5|$|The {{combat system}} is turn-based instead of real-time. Gameplay is usually step-based, where player actions are {{performed}} serially {{and take a}} variable measure of in-game time to complete. Game processes (e.g., monster movement and interaction, progressive effects such as poisoning or starvation) advance based on {{the passage of time}} dictated by <b>these</b> <b>actions.</b> This requires the player to learn and apply tactics as they progress in the dungeon.|$|E
5|$|<b>These</b> <b>actions</b> are {{represented}} in a form of visual shorthand by the three basic elements of Feynman diagrams: a wavy line for the photon, a straight line for the electron and a junction of two straight lines and a wavy one for a vertex representing emission or absorption of a photon by an electron. These can all {{be seen in the}} adjacent diagram.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid hormones act by {{crossing}} the cell membrane and binding to intracellular nuclear thyroid hormone receptors TR-α1,TR-α2,TR-β1 and TR-β2, which bind with hormone response elements and transcription factors to modulate DNA transcription. In addition to <b>these</b> <b>actions</b> on DNA, the thyroid hormones also act within the cell membrane or within cytoplasm via reactions with enzymes, including calcium ATPase, adenylyl cyclase, and glucose transporters.|$|E

50|$|In summary, a push {{activity}} {{is akin to}} a direct marketing activity, whereas pull activities are more indirect marketing of the same concept. Both ideally result in applicants becoming interested and the interest triggering a response (applying, referring, calling, sending an SMS, etc.). <b>These</b> <b>action</b> triggers are also {{sometimes referred to as}} Call To Action (CTA) steps.|$|R
5|$|After her release, Sarumpaet {{continued}} {{to participate in}} pro-democracy movements; <b>these</b> <b>actions</b> led to her fleeing Indonesia after hearing rumours {{that she would be}} arrested for dissent. When she returned to Indonesia, Sarumpaet {{continued to}} write politically charged stageplays. She became head of the Jakarta Art Board in 2003; two years later she was approached by UNICEF and asked to write a drama to raise awareness of child trafficking in Southeast Asia. The resulting work served as the foundation for her 2009 feature film debut, Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President). This film was submitted to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film but not nominated. The following year, she released her first novel, Maluku, Kobaran Cintaku (Maluku, Flame of My Love).|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Fort Sumter, Lincoln {{realized}} {{the importance of}} taking immediate executive control {{of the war and}} making an overall Union military strategy to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending habeas corpus, arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for <b>these</b> <b>actions.</b> In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.|$|E
5|$|Although the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are {{generally}} considered {{the starting point}} of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date. <b>These</b> <b>actions,</b> often organized by local homophile organizations but sometimes spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations to the exclusion of homosexuals from the United States military to police harassment to the treatment of homosexuals in revolutionary Cuba. The early actions have been credited with preparing the gay community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power.|$|E

40|$|Transforming {{guideline}} recommendations into executable statements for computerized {{decision support}} systems requires {{a clear understanding}} of what tasks must be performed. We sought (a) to determine whether a limited set of action types could be defined to comprehensively categorize activities recommended by the majority of clinical guidelines, (b) to describe the relative frequency of <b>these</b> <b>action</b> types, and (c) to create a library of recommendations for future validation activities. We randomly selected test and validation sets of 50 recommendations each from the National Guideline Clearinghouse and randomly extracted 3 recommendations from each guideline. We tested the ability of a preliminary palette of action types to categorize guideline-prescribed activities and expanded it to accommodate several unanticipated actions. Ultimately, the following actions were sufficient to categorize all 405 actions: Prescribe, Perform therapeutic procedure, Educate/Counsel, Test, Dispose, Refer/Consult, Conclude, Monitor, Document, Advocate, Prepare, and No recommendation. <b>These</b> <b>action</b> types can be used to construct a framework for design of clinical decision support systems...|$|R
50|$|Another {{feature of}} Moigle {{is that the}} player can play short minigames with him to earn points. When enough points are collected, Moigle can learn a new <b>action.</b> <b>These</b> new <b>actions</b> can be to over come his fear of spiders, play with a yo-yo, and many others.|$|R
