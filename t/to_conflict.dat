5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{happens when}} a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making {{has been associated with}} anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive <b>to</b> <b>conflict,</b> and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in decision making in uncertain conditions.|$|E
5|$|From the Forth {{south to}} the River Humber lay the kingdom of Northumbria.

The growing power of the Mercian kingdom to the south added to the problems faced by Northumbrian kings. For most of Óengus's reign Northumbria was ruled by the capable King Eadberht Eating.|$|E

Border disputes, power struggles among diverse regional factions, and attempts to establish regional and internal influence would eventually spark the Uruguayan War as well as the later Paraguayan War.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study is to develop and test a conceptual model to examine the effects of work <b>to</b> family <b>conflict,</b> family <b>to</b> work <b>conflict,</b> and emotional exhaustion on job performance. A Sample of this study are nurse (female) and midwife with public servant’s status in Public Hospital at RSUD Kardinah Tegal. A total of 106 usable responses were obtained. Several analytical techniques were used to evaluate the relationships among the variables under investigation such as SEM AMOS 18. 0 and SPSS 16. 0. Sobel test was used to evaluate the mediating role. The finding of this study have shown that : (1) the positive effect of work <b>to</b> family <b>conflict</b> <b>to</b> emotional exhaustion (2) the positive effect of family <b>to</b> work <b>conflict</b> <b>to</b> emotional exhaustion (not supported) (3) the negative effect of emotional exhaustion to job performance (4) the negative effect of work <b>to</b> family <b>conflict</b> <b>to</b> job performance (not supported) and (5) the negative effect of family <b>to</b> work <b>conflict</b> <b>to</b> job performance.

5|$|As the Great War progressed, war {{exhaustion}} in Germany grew. The first {{strikes in}} the country {{since the start of}} the war broke out in 1915, steadily increasing in frequency and magnitude. The unions' role as troubleshooter between the employers and the workers soon led <b>to</b> <b>conflict</b> between the membership and union officials, and the Free Trade Unions steadily lost members. Correspondingly, the Reichstag faction of the SPD split over continued support for the war. The 1917 February Revolution in Russia was seen by the FVdG as an expression of the people's desire for peace. The syndicalists paid special attention to the role the general strike (which they had been advocating for years) played in the revolution. They were unable to comment on the October Revolution as the Rundschreiben had been banned by the time it broke out.|$|E

Since 1980 the taxonomy (relationships), taphonomy (how the animals became embedded and fossilized), biomechanics (how their skeletons worked), and palaeobiology (life circumstances) of Plateosaurus have been re-studied in detail, altering the interpretation of the animal's biology, posture and behaviour.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1960s then-President Sukarno {{declared}} {{a new state}} ideology of Nasakom, which stood for Nasionalisme, Agama, dan Komunisme (Nationalism, Religion, and Communism), which would complement the existing policy of Pancasila. This declaration, viewed as proof of increasing Indonesian Communist Party (Partai Komunis Indonesia, or PKI) power, led <b>to</b> <b>conflict</b> between the PKI and the military. In {{the midst of an}} escalating confrontation with Malaysia (1963–1966), Sukarno demoted General Abdul Haris Nasution, Commander of the Army, and promoted Ahmad Yani, while the PKI spread rumours that a CIA-sponsored board of generals (Dewan Jenderal) were plotting against the government, using the Gilchrist Document as proof. Eventually, a coup on 30 September 1965, thought to have been sponsored by the PKI, killed six generals, leading to the massacre of suspected communists and the fall of Sukarno's government over the next two years.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} 20 years of settlement, {{there was only}} limited contact between the {{settlers}} and Aboriginal people. Joseph Franklin purchased land in the Brindabellas in 1849 and attempted {{to set up a}} cattle farm. His livestock were slaughtered by the local Aboriginal people and he was driven back out of the mountains. The rush of prospectors into the Kiandra area through the Brindabellas and the mountains {{to the west of the}} ACT as a result of the Kiandra goldrush led <b>to</b> <b>conflict</b> with the Aboriginal people. By the time Franklin returned to the Brindabellas in 1863, the indigenous population had been significantly reduced.|$|E

5|$|From 1937 {{new steel}} O stock trains, with doors {{remotely}} {{operated by the}} guard, replaced the wooden-bodied trains dating from 1906. It had been intended to operate the new trains with four or six cars, but after initial problems with the traction current only six-car formations were used. Services to Kensington (Olympia) via the curve at Latimer Road were suspended in 1940 after bomb damage to the West London line and not restarted after the war. When the similar trains running on the Circle line were lengthened to six cars in 1959 and 1960, the stock of the two lines was integrated with maintenance at Hammersmith depot. Aluminium C Stock trains, with public address systems and originally unpainted, replaced these trains from 1970. One person operation was proposed in 1972, but due <b>to</b> <b>conflict</b> with the trade unions was not introduced until 1984.|$|E
