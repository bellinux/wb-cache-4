The team defeated the Chicago Bulls in seven {{games in the}} conference semifinals, then the Golden State Warriors in five in the Western Division Finals. They played the New York Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals. Los Angeles <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> game by three points, but New York won the series in five games.|$|E

5|$|After the Headingley Test, Loxton {{came in at}} 5/344 {{and made}} an attacking 51 as Australia batted first and made 456 against Derbyshire. He then took 1/27 from 17.4 overs in the first innings. Australia {{enforced}} the follow on and Loxton <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> wicket before returning to take two tail-end wickets and end with 3/16 from 13.4 overs as Australia won by an innings. Loxton was the most economical of the Australian wicket-takers. After six consecutive matches, Loxton was rested for the rain-affected draw against Glamorgan, which did not reach the second innings. The hosts were bowled out for 197 and Australia reached 3/215 when inclement weather ended the match.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Fingleton <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{steps in}} his journalism career, when his cousin helped {{him to become a}} copy boy with the now defunct Sydney Daily Guardian. Encouraged by his former headmaster, who had {{prompted}} his interest in writing, Fingleton quickly eased into his new career. Fingleton started as a sports reporter, and had a narrow escape when he was sacked by Robert Clyde Packer for breaking a pot, but then reinstated. Fingleton then risked being fired by removing cricket articles written by the famed Neville Cardus from the newspaper's archive against policy for his personal use.|$|E

5|$|Bryan Still fielded the Tennessee kickoff and {{returned}} it to the 19-yard line of Virginia Tech. After a short pass, DeShazo threw his second interception of the game. Tennessee defender John Summers returned the catch to the Tech 19-yard line, and backup quarterback Branndon Stewart returned to the game for Tennessee's offense. James Stewart <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> play of the Volunteers' drive, an eight-yard gain, then backup Jay Graham entered the game {{and ran to the}} five-yard line for a first down. After the next play—, a two-yard run by Graham—Tennessee committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty, pushing the Volunteers back to the 17-yard line. Branndon Stewart completed a pass to tight end David Horn, pushing Tennessee back to the three-yard line, but not gaining enough for a first down. Tennessee kicker John Becksvoort returned to the game, and his 19-yard field goal attempt was good, giving the Volunteers a 4516 lead with 9:41 to go in the game.|$|E
5|$|Cancellara {{began to}} achieve success in June, during the Tour de Suisse. He won the opening time {{trial of the}} race and the time trial on stage nine en route to his overall victory. In {{addition}} to the general classification, he also won the secondary points classification of the Tour de Suisse. A week after finishing the Tour de Suisse, {{he won his first}} Swiss national road racing crown on 28 June after outsprinting Mathias Frank at the line. He continued to win in July, as he won the opening stage of the Tour de France and <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> yellow jersey of the race. He then successfully defended the lead until the seventh stage, when he was unable to bridge the gap to the leaders on the Arcalis mountain-top finish.|$|E
5|$|Celtic {{reached the}} semi-final of the European Cup in 1972, with Inter Milan their opponents. The tie {{remained}} goal-less {{after the end}} of both games and 30 minutes of extra time in the second leg in Glasgow. As such, the tie went to penalty kicks to find a winner, the first time a European Cup tie was decided in this manner. Inter Milan's Sandro Mazzola <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> penalty kick and scored. Dixie Deans took the next penalty, Celtic's first, but fired his shot over the crossbar. The Italians scored all of their remaining penalties to eliminate Celtic.|$|E

5|$|During the Battle of Britain, on 27 October 1940, a Messerschmitt Me 109E {{flown by}} Fw Lothar Schieverhofer, of 3 Gruppe, Jagdgeschwader 52, was damaged in a dogfight with Supermarine Spitfire IIa P7494 of No. 74 Squadron RAF, flown by Plt Off Peter Chesters. The Messerschmitt made a wheels-up landing at RAF Penshurst, where Chesters also landed {{a few minutes}} later as he was short of fuel. Chesters dragged the German from his aircraft. Schieverhofer spat in his face, and a fist-fight {{developed}} with both combatants swearing at each other in German. The fight was broken up by the arrival of an ARP Warden, a policeman and a soldier. Chesters was forced to hand back Schieverhofer's Iron Cross, which he had snatched as a souvenir, and instead <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> aid kit from the Messerschmitt. Schieverhofer was taken away from RAF Penshurst as a prisoner of war.|$|E
5|$|Each year, the Trait du Nord is {{honored at}} an {{agricultural}} show and horse show in Paris. In 1995, the breed won the International Workhorse Trophy at the Paris show and in 2010, a Trait du Nord <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> place prize for weight pulling at the show. Trait du Nord teams {{participate in the}} Route du Poisson, a relay race commemorating the route that teams took to bring fresh fish from Boulogne to Paris until the 19th century. The race takes place {{every two or three}} years and is the biggest equine relay race in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Examples of Rossier's {{views of}} Switzerland {{are held in}} several {{institutions}} and private collections in that country. Rossier <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> commercial photographs of China and Japan, and they are now quite rare. He complained at times of the adverse effects of the climate on his photographic chemicals {{and some of his}} negatives may have been damaged en route to London from Asia. Though his surviving images are scarce, his importance to the early history of photography in Asia is great. Before his arrival in Japan in 1859, Japanese students of photography had struggled to produce satisfactory images, but Rossier's experience, instruction, and contacts with suppliers of photographic materials were extremely helpful in the development of an autonomous photographic tradition in Japan.|$|E

5|$|Heterodontosaurids {{are named}} for their {{strongly}} heterodont dentition. There were three premaxillary teeth. In the Early Jurassic Abrictosaurus, Heterodontosaurus, and Lycorhinus, {{the first two}} premaxillary teeth were small and conical, while the much larger third tooth resembled the canines of carnivoran mammals and is often called the caniniform or 'tusk'. A lower caniniform, larger than the upper, <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> position in the dentary and was accommodated by the arched diastema of the upper jaw when the mouth was closed. These caniniforms were serrated on both the anterior and posterior edges in Heterodontosaurus and Lycorhinus, while those of Abrictosaurus bore serrations only on the anterior edge. In the Early Cretaceous Echinodon, {{there may have been}} two upper caniniforms, which were on the maxilla rather than the premaxilla, and Fruitadens from the Late Jurassic may have had two lower caniniforms on each dentary.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Wales won the Home Championship and then, in 1910 – {{with the}} {{inclusion}} of France – the first Five Nations. In 1911, Wales <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Five Nations Grand Slam by winning all their matches in the Five Nations; France were heavily defeated by Wales at St Helens in 1910 (49–14) and Ivor Morgan scored two tries in the match. It would be nearly forty years before they achieved a Grand Slam again. England's defeat of Wales at Cardiff in 1913 was Wales' first home loss {{to one of the}} Home Nations since 1899, and their first home loss to England since 1895. The Great War came in 1914 and rugby was suspended for the duration.|$|E
5|$|In the 1974 season, Reutemann <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> three {{victories}} of his Formula One career, and Brabham's {{first since}} 1970. The team finished a close {{fifth in the}} Constructors' Championship, fielding the much more competitive BT44s. After a strong finish to the 1974 season, many observers felt the team were favourites to win the 1975 title. The year started well, with a first win for Brazilian driver Carlos Pace at the Interlagos circuit in his native São Paulo. However, as the season progressed, tyre wear frequently slowed the cars in races. Pace took another two podiums and finished sixth in the championship; while Reutemann had five podium finishes, including a dominant win in the 1975 German Grand Prix, and {{finished third in the}} Drivers' Championship. The team likewise ranked third in the Constructors' Championship {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E
