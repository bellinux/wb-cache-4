5|$|In January 1977, Victor diSuvero and {{his firm}} Sapphire-Yogo Mines became the next owner {{to tackle the}} Yogo dike. DiSuvero was a {{native-born}} Italian {{who grew up in}} Tientsin, China, and had been successful with a jade mine in California. DiSuvero's expertise was in marketing: he formed a company called Sapphire Trading <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> market the Yogos. He had novel marketing ideas but was not knowledgeable about the mining side of the business. Unable to make payments, his venture folded in late 1979.|$|E

The official teaser trailer premiered before , {{and the first}} official trailer appeared online on June 26, 2006. Another trailer circulated in July 2006, showing several of the snake attacks and a missing pilot and co-pilot. Rotten Tomatoes had video clips of the official trailers, as well as fan-made trailers.|$|E
5|$|Ostrom {{suggested}} that Deinonychus could kick with the sickle claw <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> slash at its prey. Some researchers even {{suggested that}} the talon was used to disembowel large ceratopsian dinosaurs. Other {{studies have suggested that}} the sickle claws were not used to slash but rather to deliver small stabs to the victim. In 2005, Manning and colleagues ran tests on a robotic replica that precisely matched the anatomy of Deinonychus and Velociraptor, and used hydraulic rams to make the robot strike a pig carcass. In these tests, the talons made only shallow punctures and could not cut or slash. The authors suggested that the talons would have been more effective in climbing than in dealing killing blows.|$|E

He states that rock crystal is valuable for its transparency and hardness, and can be carved into vessels and implements. He relates {{the story of a}} woman who owned a ladle made of the mineral, paying the sum of 150,000 sesterces for the item. Nero deliberately broke two crystal cups when he realised {{that he was about to}} be deposed, so denying their use to anyone else.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} has been produced and marketed as merchandise over the years. In 1988 Screamin' Toys produced a model kit where owners could {{build their own}} Jason statuette. The kit required the owner <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> paint various parts in order to assemble the figure. Six years later, Screamin' Toys issued a new model kit for Jason Goes to Hell. Both kits are now out of production. McFarlane Toys released two toy lines, one in 1998 {{and the other in}} 2002. The first was a figure of Jason from Jason Goes to Hell, and the other was of Über-Jason from Jason X. Since McFarlane's last toy line in 2002, there has been a steady production of action figures, dolls, and statuettes. These include tie-ins with the film Freddy vs. Jason (2003). In April 2010 Sideshow Toys released a polystone statue of Jason, based on the version appearing in the 2009 remake.|$|E

25|$|Fougères is {{situated}} in the Cadomian chain. The oldest buildings use readily available stone: la cornéenne. A metamorphic rock, difficult <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> of very different appearance, it is very solid. Later came the use of Louvigné granite, which is more homogeneous. Most of the buildings of the town are built with these local materials. It took {{the arrival of the}} railway to import other stones (late 19th century). In military strategy, note that the castle is not on high, but on a deposit of la cornéenne, which prevents the risk of attacks by mining and from underground.|$|E
25|$|The knife also {{features}} a glass-breaker, but unlike many other glass-breakers on folding knives, the tip {{is part of the}} blade itself which protrudes from the pivot side when the knife is closed. The Umnumzaan also was the first Chris Reeve folding knife to incorporate a lanyard pivot joint, which dramatically reduces the friction wear that over time destroys paracord lanyards. It also allows easy swapping of lanyards without a need <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> retie if the owner has multiple lanyard pivots (referred to as a “cord tie bar” by Chris Reeve Knives). The lanyard pivot joint has since been incorporated on the Sebenza Classic 2000, Sebenza 21, and Sebenza 25.|$|E

25|$|Law {{and order}} {{had broken down}} many times before Partition, with much bloodshed on both sides. A massive civil war was looming by the time Mountbatten became Viceroy. After the Second World War, Britain had limited resources, perhaps {{insufficient}} {{to the task of}} keeping order. Another viewpoint is that while Mountbatten may have been too hasty he had no real options left and achieved the best he could under difficult circumstances. The historian Lawrence James concurs that in 1947 Mountbatten was left with no option but <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> run. The alternative seemed to be involvement in a potentially bloody civil war from which {{it would be difficult to}} get out.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{argue that}} the British were forced to {{expedite}} the Partition by events on the ground. Once in office, Mountbatten quickly became aware if Britain were to avoid involvement in a civil war, which seemed increasingly likely, there was no alternative to partition and a hasty exit from India.

25|$|The United States also lacks {{an agency}} {{in charge of}} diamond import confirmations, which allows traders to bypass the {{requirement}} of reporting the receipt of the diamond shipment within 15 days of the arrival. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the agency in charge of overseeing incoming diamond shipments and conducting examinations of shipments. There is also little oversight of the U.S. Kimberley Process Authority (USKPA), {{who are responsible for}} issuing Kimberley Process certificates, so no one supervises the company making sure that USKPA adheres to KPCS standards. The closest oversight comes from the Department of State, who “convene periodic teleconferences with the USKPA”. The CDTA also does not directly deal with the retail diamond sector, as the Act only applies to rough diamonds as opposed <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> polished diamonds. While some retailers take strong initiatives to avoid conflict diamonds, many do not, so the effectiveness of the Act to completely eliminate the trade of conflict diamonds is often questioned. It has also been suggested that other countries have similarly struggled with the implementation of the KPCS.|$|E
25|$|Laotians and Cambodians have {{a common}} belief that the Irrawaddy {{dolphins}} are reincarnations of their ancestors. Some even claim that the dolphins have saved drowning villagers and protected people from attacks by crocodiles. With their beliefs and experiences, it has led the people of Laos and Cambodia to live peacefully alongside one another for ages until recent years when the technique of using explosives for fishing has emerged. The government of Laos has made it illegal to use such tactics, but few regulations {{have been made in}} its neighboring country of Cambodia. In Cambodia, explosives are sold in local markets and the practice of using fishnets has been abandoned. The practice of using explosives instead has become very popular and led to a stead decline of populations of fish, and especially the dolphins swimming in the area. Although Laotians may not use explosives, they do use nylon gill nets, which pose as another large threat in the survival of the Irrawaddy. Some dolphins will accidentally become entangled in the net. Poor fishermen refuse <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> destroy their nets because it would result in too great of an economic loss to save one Irrawaddy dolphin.|$|E
25|$|UNAMSIL was {{eventually}} formed and deployed in 1999, authorised under a Chapter VII mandate, {{it was meant}} to enforce the Lome agreements. However, violence would continue. From the outset the RUF was beyond uncooperative and once the ECOMOG contingent withdrew, the RUF attacked UN forces, eventually taking hundreds hostage. This led to an unexpected backlash from the international community that the RUF did not anticipate. Its leadership had expected the international community <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> run, as it had done in Somalia and earlier when UNOMSIL fled Freetown. Instead, with British support, an aggressive campaign was waged against the RUF. UNAMSIL's mandate was expanded and its manpower enlarged. By late 2000 and early 2001 the RUF's military strength had been severely depleted. Thus the Abuja agreements were signed and UNAMSIL fulfilled its mandate in December 2005. While Sierra Leone is at peace today and the UN's mission can be deemed a success, {{the way in which the}} situation developed illustrates Shearer's point: that a consent-based approach focused on negotiation that encompasses all belligerents' interest may not necessarily lead to success. As we see, fighting continued despite the presence of UNOMSIL. Indeed, even after UNOMSIL was replaced by a more robust force under a Chapter VII mandate in the form of UNAMSIL the violence continued. It was not until the British intervened militarily and substantially degraded the RUF's capability to sustain the conflict, as Executive Outcomes had done years prior, did the RUF finally come to the negotiating table and allow for the establishment of peace.|$|E
