[...] The receiver {{also has}} a temperature associated with it, TE, and the total system temperature <b>T</b> (<b>antenna</b> plus receiver) has a combined temperature given by T = TA + TE. This temperature {{can be used in}} the above equation to find the total noise power of the system. These concepts begin to illustrate how antenna engineers must understand receivers and the associated electronics, because the resulting systems very much depend on each other.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "multiple-tuned flattop antenna" [...] is {{a variant}} of the <b>T</b> <b>antenna</b> used in high power low {{frequency}} transmitters to reduce ground power losses. [...] It consists of a long capacitive top-load consisting of multiple parallel wires supported by a line of transmission towers, sometimes several miles long. Several vertical radiator wires hang down from the top-load, each attached to its own ground through a loading coil. The antenna is driven either at one of the radiator wires, or more often {{at one end of the}} top-load, by bringing the wires of the top-load diagonally down to the transmitter. Although the vertical wires are separated, the distance between them is small compared to the length of the LF waves, so the currents in them are in phase and they can be considered as one radiator. Since the antenna current flows into the ground through N parallel loading coils and grounds rather than one, the equivalent loading coil and ground resistance, and therefore the power dissipated in the loading coil and ground, is reduced to 1/N that of a simple <b>T</b> <b>antenna.</b> [...] The antenna was used in the powerful radio stations of the wireless telegraphy era but has fallen out of favor due to the expense of multiple loading coils.|$|E

5000|$|High power {{transmitting}} antennas for VLF frequencies {{are very}} large wire antennas, up to a mile across. They {{consist of a}} series of steel radio masts, linked at the top with a network of cables, often shaped like an umbrella or clotheslines. Either the towers themselves or vertical wires serve as monopole radiators, and the horizontal cables form a capacitive top-load to increase the efficiency of the antenna. High power stations use variations on the umbrella antenna such as the [...] "delta" [...] and [...] "trideco" [...] antennas, or multiply-tuned flattop (triatic) antennas. For low power transmitters, inverted-L and <b>T</b> <b>antennas</b> are used. A large loading coil is required at the antenna feed point to cancel the capacitive reactance of the antenna to make it resonant.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: RF current {{distributions}} (red) in {{a vertical}} antenna (a) and the <b>T</b> <b>antenna</b> (b), showing how the horizontal wire serves {{to improve the}} efficiency of the vertical radiating wire. [...] The width of the red area perpendicular to the wire at any point is proportional to the current. At resonance the current is the tail part of a sinusoidal standing wave. In the vertical antenna (a), the current must go to zero at the top. In the T (b), the current flows into the horizontal wire, increasing the current in the top part of the vertical wire. The radiation resistance and thus the radiated power in each, is proportional to the square of the area of the vertical part of the current distribution.|$|E
5000|$|The power {{radiated}} (or received) by an electrically short {{vertical antenna}} like the T {{is proportional to}} the square of the [...] "effective height" [...] of the antenna, [...] so the antenna should be made as high as possible. Without the horizontal wire, the RF current distribution in the vertical wire would decrease linearly to zero at the top (see drawing a above), giving an effective height of half the physical height of the antenna. With an ideal [...] "infinite capacitance" [...] top load wire, the current in the vertical would be constant along its length, giving an effective height equal to the physical height, therefore increasing the power radiated fourfold. So the power radiated (or received) by a <b>T</b> <b>antenna</b> is up to four times that of a vertical monopole of the same height.|$|E
50|$|Since it is {{shorter than}} λ/4 the <b>T</b> <b>antenna</b> {{has a high}} {{capacitive}} reactance. In transmitting antennas, to make the antenna resonant {{so it can be}} driven efficiently, this capacitance must be canceled out by adding an inductor, a loading coil, in series with the bottom of the antenna. Particularly at lower frequencies, the high inductance and capacitance compared to its low radiation resistance makes the loaded antenna behave like a high Q tuned circuit, with a narrow bandwidth over which it will remain impedance matched to the transmission line, compared to a λ/4 monopole. To operate over a large frequency range the loading coil often must be adjustable, and adjusted when the frequency is changed to keep the SWR low. The high Q also causes a high voltage on the antenna, roughly Q times the driving-point voltage. The insulators at the ends must be designed to withstand these voltages. In high power transmitters the output power is often limited by the onset of corona discharge on the wires.|$|E

In the study, three-dimensional finite-element models were utilized to examine the tissue temperature distributions during and after MW ablation. A preliminary study was first carried out {{with regard to the}} specific absorption rates along the 4 <b>T</b> <b>antenna</b> insertion depths and the temperature distributions inside the solid and porous liver models with either 3 [*]cm-in-diameter tumor or 5 [*]cm-in-diameter tumor. Based on the preliminary results, the porous models were further examined for the effect of varying blood flow velocities (0 – 200 [*]cm/s) with a 1 [*]cm-in-diameter blood vessel next to the antenna and also for the effect of vessel-antenna locations (0, 0. 8, and 1. 3 [*]cm) with a constant blood flow velocity of 16. 7 [*]cm/s. All scenarios were simulated under temperature-controlled mode (90 °C).

40|$|Two L- and T-shaped strip dipole on-chip antennas are {{designed}} and manufactured back-to-back {{in a single}} chip for 77 GHz operation. The antennas are measured for their reflection coefficients and radiation patterns at W band. It has been observed that measurements are highly influenced by the antenna placements and the ACP 110 -A-GSG- 100 probe. To model the effect of air coplanar probe (ACP probe), a software calibration is performed similar to a network analyzer calibration, and then the antenna reflection coefficient is calculated using the modeled probe-fed antenna. The technique employs obtaining the probe ABCD matrix and then de-embedding from the simulation results to compare with measurements. The probe-fed simulated and measured reflection coefficients agree well for manufactured L and T antennas, which resonate at 86 and 81 GHz, respectively. There are resonance frequency shifts attributed to the ACP probe effect, and simulations show that antennas will operate at 79 GHz (L antenna) and 77 GHz (<b>T</b> <b>antenna)</b> {{in the absence of}} ACP probe.

40|$|Aiming {{to achieve}} the sum-rate {{capacity}} in multiuser multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channels with N <b>t</b> <b>antennas</b> implemented at the transmitter, opportunistic beamforming (OBF) generates N t orthonormal beams and serves N t users during each transmission, which results in high scheduling delay over the users, especially in densely populated wireless networks. Non-orthogonal OBF with more than N t transmit beams can be exploited to serve more users simultaneously and further decreases scheduling delay. However, the inter-beam interference will inevitably deteriorate the sum-rate. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between the sum-rate and {{the increasing number of}} transmit beams. In this context, the sum-rate of non-orthogonal OBF with N > N t beams are studied, where the transmitter is based on the Grassmannian beamforming. Our results show that non-orthogonal OBF is an interference-limited system. Moreover, when the inter-beam interference reaches its minimum for fixed N t and N, the sum-rate scales as N ln (N/N-N t) and it decreases monotonically with N for fixed N t. Numerical results corroborate the accuracy of our analyses. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|We {{study in}} this paper the network {{spectral}} efficiency in terms of bits/s/Hz of a MIMO (multiple-input multiple output) ad hoc network with K simultaneous communicating transmitter-receiver pairs. Assume that each transmitter is equipped with <b>t</b> <b>antennas</b> and each receiver with r antennas and each receiver implements single user detection. We show that {{in the absence of}} channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters, the asymptotic network spectral efficiency is limited by r nats/s/Hz as K! 1 and is independent of t and the transmit power. With CSI corresponding to the desired receiver available at the transmitter, we demonstrate that the asymptotic spectral efficiency is at least t+r+ 2 p tr nats/s/Hz. Asymptotically optimum signaling is also derived under the same CSI assumption, i. e., each transmitter knows the channel corresponding to its desired receiver only. Further capacity improvement is possible with stronger CSI assumption; we demonstrate this using a heuristic interference suppression transmit beamforming approach. The traditional non-interference transmission approach is also analyzed. In particular, we show tha...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{modified}} Cramér-Rao lower bounds (MCRLBs) on the joint estimation of target position and velocity is investigated for a universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) -based passive multistatic radar system with antenna arrays. First, we analyze the log-likelihood redfunction of the received signal for a complex Gaussian extended target. Then, {{due to the}} non-deterministic transmitted data symbols, the analytically closed-form expressions of the MCRLBs on the Cartesian coordinates of target position and velocity are derived for a multistatic radar system with N t UMTS-based transmit station of L <b>t</b> <b>antenna</b> elements and N r receive stations of L r antenna elements. With the aid of numerical simulations, it is shown that {{increasing the number of}} receiving elements in each receive station can reduce the estimation errors. In addition, it is demonstrated that the MCRLB is not only a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the number of receiving antenna elements and the properties of the transmitted UMTS signals, but also a function of the relative geometric configuration between the target and the multistatic radar system. The analytical expressions for MCRLB will open up a new dimension for passive multistatic radar system by aiding the optimal placement of receive stations to improve the target parameter estimation performance...|$|E

This study investigates whether loopless antennae offer signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and field-of-view (FOV) advantages at higher fields, and whether device heating {{can be controlled}} within safe limits. The absolute SNR performance of loopless antennae from 0. 5 to 5 T is investigated both analytically, using electromagnetic (EM) dipole antenna theory, and numerically with the EM method of moments, and found to vary almost quadratically with field strength depending on the medium’s electrical properties, the noise being dominated by direct sample conduction losses. The prediction is confirmed by measurements of the absolute SNR of low-loss loopless antennae fabricated for 1. 5, 3, and 4. 7 T, immersed in physiologically comparable saline. Gains of 3. 8 ± 0. 2 - and 9. 7 ± 0. 3 -fold in SNR, and approximately 10 - and 50 -fold gains in the useful FOV area are observed at 3 and 4. 7 T, respectively, compared to 1. 5 T.
