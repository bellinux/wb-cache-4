5|$|Chairman Joseph S. Clark {{suggested}} that the subcommittee travel to Mississippi to verify Wright's testimony. Of the subcommittee's nine members, Senators Robert F.

Edelman spoke extensively with Wright, whom he would marry 15 months later.|$|E
5|$|During 1962 Sykes was {{approached}} by the Russian-American composer Nicolas Nabokov, who was interested in making an opera from the Pinfold story {{on the basis of}} a libretto provided by Sykes. Waugh gave his approval <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> and in March 1962 met with Nabokov. Discussions continued during the following months, before the project was abandoned in the summer.|$|E

5|$|Following in {{the path}} paved by {{linguist}} Noam Chomsky, Fodor developed a strong commitment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of psychological nativism. Nativism postulates the innateness of many cognitive functions and concepts. For Fodor, this position emerges naturally out of his criticism of behaviourism and associationism. These criticisms also {{led him to the}} formulation of his hypothesis of the modularity of the mind.|$|E

5|$|Incidentally, the {{harmonic}} telegraph directly suggested to Bell {{the idea of}} the telephone. The reeds can be viewed as transducers converting sound to and from an electrical signal.

5|$|The {{presence}} of pycnofibers (and {{the demands of}} flight) imply that pterosaurs were endothermic (warm-blooded). The absence of pycnofibers on pterosaur wings suggests that the coat {{did not have an}} aerodynamic function, lending support <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that pycnofibers evolved to aid pterosaur thermoregulation, as is common in warm-blooded animals, insulation being necessary to conserve the heat created by an endothermic metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Alice again laid {{claim to}} the regency. However, most Antiochene lords {{remained}} hostile <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a female ruler and sent envoys to BaldwinII's successor, Fulk of Anjou, who was Alice's brother-in-law. Alice made an alliance with Joscelin II, Count of Edessa, and Pons, Count of Tripoli, in early 1132. Fulk had to travel to Antioch by sea, because Pons did not allow him to march through the County of Tripoli. Fulk landed at St. Symeon where the Antiochene barons acknowledged him as regent. He appointed Reynald I Mazoir, Constable of Antioch, to administer the principality.|$|E
50|$|In 1615, Vincenzo Scamozzi {{published}} the late Renaissance treatise L'Idea dell'Architettura Universale (<b>The</b> <b>Idea</b> of a Universal Architecture).

5|$|Allen first {{requested}} to be baptised {{when he was}} nine, but his family was initially resistant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> On 15 September 1962, at age eleven, Allen was baptised by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. While still a teacher, Allen was trained and ordained as an Elder, and was encouraged to become a pastor. After over a decade in education, Allen left his teaching career and travelled to Andrews University in the United States where he received a Bachelor of Arts in History and Religion in 1985 and a Master of Arts in Systematic Theology a year later.|$|E
5|$|Although {{calls for}} a special session of the {{legislature}} {{had been made in}} February and March, Governor Stanley was not initially receptive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> at the beginning of April. In mid-April, Virginia Lieutenant Governor Gi Stevens urged Stanley to call a special session of the General Assembly to reconsider the Gray Commission proposals. In May, at least one state delegate urged the General Assembly to call itself into special session.|$|E
5|$|Behind the scenes, Welensky and the Rhodesians {{had been}} courting the Conservatives, while the native Africans {{had been doing}} the same with Labour. A British general {{election}} was held in 1951 and the Conservatives gained power. Labour, mindful of the overwhelming opposition of Africans from both Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and of the Colonial Office mandate to oversee native interests, had been lukewarm at best <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of federation, and had been wholly opposed to amalgamation. After the election, the bipartisan approach to federation broke down and the British laws for its creation passed only {{with the support of}} the Conservatives, with both Liberal and Labour Parties now opposed.|$|E

5|$|By 1931, many Duval County {{residents}} were warming <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of merging municipal and county governments to reduce bureaucracy, corruption and weak management. As a result, in 1932, citizens of both cities {{voted for the}} annexation of South Jacksonville into Jacksonville. While full city-county consolidation was voted down, {{the efforts of the}} 1930s set the stage for further attempts, ultimately resulting in the 1968 Jacksonville Consolidation.|$|E
5|$|By late October, the German {{forces were}} worn out, {{with only a}} third of their motor {{vehicles}} still functioning, infantry divisions at third- to half-strength, and serious logistics issues preventing the delivery of warm clothing and other winter equipment to the front. Even Hitler seemed to surrender <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a long struggle, since the prospect of sending tanks into such a large city without heavy infantry support seemed risky after the costly capture of Warsaw in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Construction began before {{completion}} of the design for the gaseous diffusion process. Due to {{the large amount of}} electric power that the K-25 plant was expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own electric power plant. While the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) believed that it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about relying on a single supplier when a power failure could cost the gaseous diffusion plant weeks of work, and the lines to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure. The Kellex engineers were also attracted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of being able to generate the variable frequency current required by the gaseous diffusion process without complicated transformers.|$|E

5|$|During {{his student}} years in England, Jinnah was {{influenced}} by 19th-century British liberalism, like many other future Indian independence leaders. This political education included exposure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of the democratic nation, and progressive politics. He became an admirer of the Parsi British Indian political leaders Dadabhai Naoroji and Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. Naoroji had become the first British Member of Parliament of Indian extraction shortly before Jinnah's arrival, triumphing with a majority of three votes in Finsbury Central. Jinnah listened to Naoroji's maiden speech in the House of Commons from the visitor's gallery.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 20th century, {{paleontologist}} R. S. Lull {{proposed that}} the frills of ceratopsian dinosaurs acted as anchor points for their jaw muscles. He later noted that for Styracosaurus, the spikes would have given it a formidable appearance. In 1996, Dodson supported the idea of muscle attachments in part and created detailed diagrams of possible muscle attachments in the frills of Styracosaurus and Chasmosaurus, but did not subscribe <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that they completely filled in the fenestrae. C.A. Forster, however, {{found no evidence of}} large muscle attachments on the frill bones.|$|E
5|$|He {{perceived}} {{books as}} permanent objects that were invested with power. This power was {{unique in that}} it could transmit ideas to people of different times, cultures, and interests, and do so in ways other art forms could not. This ambition laced all of his work, particularly in his later years. Lissitzky was devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of creating art with power and purpose, art that could invoke change.|$|E
