Their first stores were centred around a piece of {{equipment}} known as the Insta-Broiler, which was very effective at cooking burgers. It proved so successful <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> grew through franchising, they required all of their franchises to carry the device.|$|E

5|$|For the 2008–09 season, Team Bath {{played at}} the highest level they {{achieved}} in their history. Competing in the Conference South, the club were two promotions away from The Football League. Early in the season Bath were competing for a play-off berth, but failed to maintain their form, eventually finishing 11th in the table with 16 wins. Towards the end of the season, the Football Conference notified Team Bath <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were not a limited company they would be ineligible for further promotions, and would no longer be allowed to compete in the FA Cup; the club opted to resign from the Conference {{at the end of the}} season rather than restructure. Team Bath had at the time been discussing the possibility of a merger with Bath City, with the aim of getting the merged team into the Football League.|$|E
5|$|Lladron Maelrhys are {{two large}} stones {{on the border}} between Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw. It is claimed that, years ago, thieves broke into St Maelrhys Church, intent on {{stealing}} money. Caught in the act, they fled for their lives but were caught as they approached Y Rhiw, and killed on the spot; the stones mark their burial place. Another version claims <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> crossed the parish boundary they were turned to stone for their sacrilege.|$|E
5|$|Petrović {{worked for}} a number of landlords {{throughout}} Šumadija until 1787, when he and his family left the region and settled in the Austrian Empire, fearing persecution {{at the hands of the}} Ottoman janissaries. It is said <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were preparing to cross the Danube into Austria, Petrović's father began to have second thoughts about leaving Šumadija. Knowing that the entire family would be put in jeopardy if his father stayed behind, Petrović either took his father's life or arranged for someone to kill him instead.|$|E

5|$|Prabhu further {{asserts that}} Tipu's hatred of Christians was {{compounded}} by fears <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> shared the same faith as their European co-religionists, the Christians were viewed as a potential fifth column {{in the event of}} a British attack. To this, he adds that Tipu also had future territorial ambitions in Goa and wanted to rid himself of any potential dissent from the Christians within his domain. Therefore, according to Prabhu, through coerced confessions of prominent Mangalorean Catholics, Tipu fabricated evidence of a large-scale Christian conspiracy against him, even though he knew it wasn't true.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 Alvarez {{joined the}} Radiation Laboratory (MIT), where he {{contributed to a}} number of World War II radar projects, from early {{improvements}} to Identification friend or foe (IFF) radar beacons, now called transponders, to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars. Enemy submarines would wait until the radar signal was getting strong and then submerge, escaping attack. But VIXEN transmitted a radar signal whose strength was the cube of the distance to the submarine so <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> approached the sub, the signal—as measured by the sub—got progressively weaker, and the sub assumed the plane was getting farther away and didn't submerge. The radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has {{played a major role in}} aviation, most particularly in the post war Berlin airlift, was Ground Controlled Approach (GCA). Alvarez spent a few months at the University of Chicago working on nuclear reactors for Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos to work for Robert Oppenheimer on the Manhattan project. Alvarez worked on the design of explosive lenses, and the development of exploding-bridgewire detonators. As a member of Project Alberta, he observed the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress, and later the bombing of Hiroshima from the B-29 The Great Artiste.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for League One football, Adams signed winger Kaid Mohamed {{to replace the}} departing Ashley Vincent. He also signed defenders Chris Robertson and Carl Dickinson, midfielders Chris Lines and Anthony Griffith, and forward Gavin Tomlin. On 22 September, Rob Page was put in temporary charge of first team affairs at Vale Park after Adams took the decision {{to take time off}} work to have hip replacement surgery. The club overstretched itself financially, meaning <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> lay outside the play-offs in January Adams could only sign largely untried youngsters on loan whilst releasing higher paid players either on free transfers or on loan. Their promotion push fell away but they ended the season in ninth place – far exceeding their original aim of avoiding relegation. During this time he had to deal with issues such as sacking defender Daniel Jones for physically attacking captain Doug Loft during training, and had to deal with months of speculation over his own future after chairman Norman Smurthwaite took until May before offering him a new one-year rolling contract. He signed the contract the following month.|$|E

25|$|Walter Herman Jacobus Steins S.J., third Catholic Bishop of Auckland (1879–1881) thought, <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were a French congregation, the Marist Brothers {{might not}} be welcome in Auckland {{and that it would}} be better to invite the Irish Christian Brothers as most of the Catholics in Auckland were Irish. Steins's successor, John Edmund Luck OSB, fourth Catholic Bishop of Auckland (1881–1896), had no such qualms and invited the Marist Brothers to {{establish}} their school.

Arabs protested against {{the distribution of the}} seats, arguing <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> constituted 88% of the population, having only 43% of the seats was unfair. Elections were held in February and March 1923, but due to an Arab boycott, the results were annulled and a 12-member Advisory Council was established.|$|E
