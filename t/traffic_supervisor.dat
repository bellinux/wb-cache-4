40|$|The {{majority}} of contemporary high-energy physics experiments study rare phenomena, which necessitates real-time high-throughput data processing {{to reduce the}} raw detector data rate of several Tbyte/s to a rate which is feasible for storage and detailed analysis. Unique trigger systems select the physical events relevant to the experiment. Typically, data fragments corresponding to the same event and originating from multiple detector data sources need to be assembled in a specific location before being processed further. The resulting communication model can lead to congestions and to inefficient system utilization if data are transferred without supervision since numerous sources are attempting to use common interconnect and computing recourses concurrently. This thesis deals with the measures taken to ensure a congestion-free, load-balanced operation of a real-time trigger farm processing data packets as small as several kbytes at a megahertz rate. The input data are initially split among multiple data feeds {{and need to be}} assembled and processed within a few milliseconds. The processing farm is built around commodity PCs which are interconnected with a commercial high-speed low-latency network implementing a torus topology. The thesis presents a system for data traffic management based on a global <b>traffic</b> <b>supervisor</b> and a dedicated control network. The former allocates distributed computing resources dynamically in order to avoid network congestions as well as to balance the load of the system. The latter communicates supervising information to all data feeds in order to initiate a controlled data transfer. A congestion-free system operation is demonstrated in a farm prototype with an integrated hardware-based implementation of the traffic shaping system. Based on parameters measured in the prototype, simulation results of a large-scale processing farm are presented. Both the prototype and the simulation results demonstrate that the system is capable of transferring input data initially split among multiple PCI-based feeding nodes, each one transmitting sub-fragments of 128 bytes, to a specific remote shared memory location at a rate beyond 2 MHz. The obtained results demonstrate the applicability of multicomputer systems based on commodity components for high-rate, low-latency trigger processing if certain care is taken in organizing the actual data transfers. This organization has to ensure efficient event building and appropriate allocation of the available processing resources...|$|E

40|$|Air {{traffic control}} {{is one of}} the most dynamic and {{stressful}} jobs in the world. In the United States Air Force (USAF), it is not uncommon for 18 year-old Airmen to arrive at an air traffic control tower to begin on the job training after graduating from the four month basic air traffic control training course. Each controller is responsible for multiple multimillion dollar aircraft and hundreds of human lives each time control instructions are transmitted; therefore, control tower leadership is essential to maintaining a safe, orderly, and effective flow of air traffic. Air <b>traffic</b> control watch <b>supervisors</b> must be able to transcend a solitary leadership style and when driven by the situation, morph from delegating to directing in a split second. Due to the fluid nature of the job, ever changing traffic conditions, and personality makeup of the personnel involved, air traffic control is the perfect environment to explore situational leadership.

We report findings from a human-in-the-loop study conducted in the Airspace Operations Laboratory (AOL) at the NASA Ames Research Center. During four afternoons in early 2010, fifteen active and recently retired air <b>traffic</b> controllers and <b>supervisors</b> controlled high levels of traffic in a highly automated environment during three-hour long scenarios, For each scenario, twelve air traffic controllers operated eight sector positions in two air traffic control areas and were supervised by three front line managers, Controllers worked one-hour shifts, were relieved by other controllers, took a 3 D-minute break, and worked another one-hour shift. On average, twice today's traffic density was simulated with more than 2200 aircraft per traffic scenario. The scenarios were designed to create peaks and valleys in traffic density, growing and decaying convective weather areas, and expose controllers to heavy and light metering conditions. This design enabled an initial look at a broad spectrum of workload, challenge, boredom, and fatigue in an otherwise uncharted territory of future operations. In this paper we report human/system integration aspects, safety and efficiency results as well as airspace throughput, workload, and operational acceptability. We conclude that, with further refinements. air traffic control operations with ground-based automated separation assurance can be an effective and acceptable means to routinely provide very high traffic throughput in the en route airspace...|$|R
40|$|Visual {{motion and}} other visual cues {{are used by}} tower {{controllers}} to provide important support for their control tasks at and near airports. These cues are particularly important for anticipated separation. Some of them, which we call visual features, have been identified from structured interviews and discussions with 24 active air <b>traffic</b> controllers or <b>supervisors.</b> The visual information that these features provide has been analyzed with respect to possible ways it could be presented at a remote tower that does not allow a direct view of the airport. Two types of remote towers are possible. One could {{be based on a}} plan-view, map-like computer-generated display of the airport and its immediate surroundings. An alternative would present a composite perspective view of the airport and its surroundings, possibly provided by an array of radially mounted cameras positioned at the airport in lieu of a tower. An initial more detailed analyses of one of the specific landing cues identified by the controllers, landing deceleration, is provided as a basis for evaluating how controllers might detect and use it. Understanding other such cues will help identify the information that may be degraded or lost in a remote or virtual tower not located at the airport. Some initial suggestions how some of the lost visual information may be presented in displays are mentioned. Many of the cues considered involve visual motion, though some important static cues are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{results of}} a multi-year, multi-organizational research initiative related to the measurement and prediction of sector level complexity called Dynamic Density (DD). The researchers first {{identified a number of}} candidate DD measures. They then identified eighteen 30 -minute traffic samples from each of four selected en route Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs). At each ARTCC, they collected complexity ratings at two-minute intervals for each traffic sample from approximately 70 air <b>traffic</b> controllers and <b>supervisors.</b> Using the <b>traffic</b> and sector data, various DD variables were computed. Using a linear regression method, the relationships between different DD variables and complexity ratings were determined. A unified DD metric composed of variables from several organizations performed the best. The results indicated that DD represents instantaneous sector complexity better than aircraft count, which is the currently used method. The results also indicated that the prediction of complexity using DD is somewhat better than the prediction using aircraft count most likely due to the inherent inaccuracy of predicting aircraft count. Background Dynamic Density (DD) is analogous to complexity or difficulty of an air traffic situation. RTCA Task Force 3 report [1] defines DD as “the essential factors affecting conflict rate in both en route and terminal airspace. ” The broader definition of DD considers as ATC taskload, which is the basis of controller subjective workload. It is a "measure of control-related workload that {{is a function of the}} number of aircraft and the complexity of traffic patterns in a volume of airspace ” [2]. For this research, the term DD is defined as the collective effect of all factors, or variables, that contribute to the sector level air traffic control complexity or difficulty at any given time [3].
