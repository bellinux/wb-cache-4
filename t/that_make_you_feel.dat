500|$|Beyoncé's mother-manager Tina Knowles {{said that}} Dangerously in Love showcases her musical roots. While Williams and Rowland were on gospel and {{alternative}} pop, respectively, Beyoncé focused on recording R songs. Songs in the album are varied: from mid-tempo and club-oriented {{tracks in the}} first half, and ballads in the second half. Beyoncé commented: [...] "My album is a good balance of... ballads and... mid-tempos with just ridin'-in-your-car feels, to a lot of... up-tempo club songs, to really sexy songs, to songs <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> emotional. It's a nice mixture {{of different types of}} tracks." [...] Although the album contains high-energy songs like [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] and [...] "Naughty Girl", the album's focal mode, however, is slow and moody. Beyoncé said that she had written lots of ballads for the album. According to Beyoncé, she wanted to be understood as an artist and showcase her range, and by doing so, she blended various genres and musical influences in the album. The album incorporates R, hip hop, soul and reggae influences. The album took hip hop influences from Jay-Z, Outkast, and Lil' Kim; the reggae is from Sean Paul; and courtesy of Storch, the album explores Arabic music. His personal study of that kind of music gave the album a Middle Eastern vibe. Beyoncé and the producers also used a wide array of instrumentations.|$|E
2500|$|Jari Mäenpää began Wintersun in 2003 [...] "to make songs <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> {{like you}} are {{floating}} in space." [...] Mäenpää chose the name [...] "Wintersun" [...] from a list a friend had produced, later explaining, [...] "Winter reflects the cold and stormy side of the album and also the Finnish melancholy and magic. Sun {{is related to the}} 'universe, space and stars'-feel of the album, which is also strongly connected to the lyrics." [...] Although the songs that would appear on Wintersun had collectively been written between 1995 and 2004 (see each track's respective composition dates here), Mäenpää kept his songwriting efforts primarily focused on folk metal band Ensiferum, with whom he'd been playing since 1996.|$|E
2500|$|Cruz {{described}} the song as an [...] "absolute club banger". The song features an uncredited rap by Cruz, which was originally not present. Cheryl {{said it was}} [...] "one of those instant tracks <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> good." [...] "Stand Up" [...] references the [...] "bop bop" [...] sung melody from Duran Duran's [...] "Planet Earth". [...] "Don't Talk About This Love" [...] was written by songwriter/producer Chris Braide and Nikola Bedingfield, the younger sister of singers Daniel and Natasha Bedingfield. It was originally recorded by Nikola Bedingfield as the title track for her debut EP. Cheryl's A at Polydor had remembered the track and suggested she record it with Braide at his studio. Cheryl was attracted to the song for its lyrics and vibe, saying it [...] "felt right." [...] In an interview with HitQuarters Braide said, [...] " [...] very emotional song. She said to me, 'I really relate to this.' And I don't know if {{it had something to}} do with her personal situation at the time, but …" [...] "Boy Like You", featuring and produced by will.i.am, samples Fleetwood Mac's 1987 single [...] "Little Lies", which initially attracted Cheryl to the song. Cheryl wanted to take the Fleetwood Mac sample and create something current and modern with it. The album also features the clean single version of will.i.am's [...] "Heartbreaker", for which Cheryl provides the female vocals.|$|E

50|$|Shocking. I {{was knocked}} out by his strikingly good guitar playing. He stands still as a statue, with no {{expression}} on his face but with {{what seems to be a}} direct connection between his brain and guitar.

On four bars distance he went up to his knees in blues mud, somewhere in the Mississippi delta, rendered guitar canons of the 1950s and finally sailed across some funk patterns of the kind <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> dizzy. Technical problems seem to be totally unknown to him. He swings strongly when he wants to. Whatever he does, he does it with a temporal precision sharp as a razor. A noteworthy man: one of the best I've ever heard, and I've heard quite a few in my life.|$|E
