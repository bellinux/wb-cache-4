50|$|In the studded <b>tyre</b> <b>class</b> {{there is}} no broadsiding around the bends due to the grip {{produced}} by the spikes digging into the ice. Instead, riders lean their bikes into the bends at an angle where the handlebars just skim the track surface. This riding style {{is different from that}} used in the other track racing disciplines. This means riders from this discipline rarely participate in Speedway or its other variants and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|In the studded <b>tyre</b> <b>class</b> {{there is}} no broadsiding around the bends due to the grip {{produced}} by the spikes digging into the ice. Instead, riders lean their bikes into the bends at an angle where the handlebars just skim the track surface. Speeds approach 80 mph on the straights, and 60 mph on the bends. The safety barrier usually consists of straw bales or banked-up snow and ice around {{the outer edge of}} the track.|$|E
5000|$|All {{cars are}} powered by Fiat engines and Dunlop <b>tyres.</b> Main <b>class</b> powered by Dallara F306, while Copa Class by Dallara F300 chassis. Guest drivers in italics.|$|R
5000|$|All {{teams were}} Spanish-registered. All cars were powered by Toyota engines and Dunlop <b>tyres.</b> Main <b>class</b> powered by Dallara F305, while Copa Class by Dallara F300 chassis.|$|R
50|$|The {{difference}} between the classes is mainly in the <b>tyres.</b> Unlimited <b>Class</b> 4x4s are allowed to use paddle tyres which dig into the earth between hops and short flights.|$|R
50|$|Privateers Cup {{cars were}} {{restricted}} to grooved Pirelli <b>tyres,</b> whereas Outright <b>Class</b> cars could use slick tyres.|$|R
50|$|Nos. 643 and 644 were {{fitted with}} {{condensing}} apparatus when built, for {{working on the}} Metropolitan Railway Widened Lines and this was added to some others in the 1890s. From 1887 they were reboilered with Dean pattern boilers and the wheels were enlarged by 1 in by means of thicker <b>tyres.</b> The <b>class</b> was reboilered again with Belpaire fireboxs (but not pannier tanks) between 1916 and 1925.|$|R
50|$|However, {{since the}} mid-2000s, {{the company is}} also {{producing}} a wide range of tyres for passenger cars.Since the early 2010s, the company also produces HT, AT and MT <b>class</b> <b>tyres</b> for all-terrain 4WD vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Maxxis {{produced}} tyres {{have been}} used in the class since its advent. The class organisers restricts the use to a single 'wet' and 'dry' <b>tyre</b> for the <b>class,</b> with the idea of creating a level performance level and removing the costs of requiring new tyres for each race weekend.|$|R
50|$|Formula TKM is a {{low-cost}} British based karting category raced at club and national championships around the UK. It uses 100cc/115cc 2-stroke TKM engines and drivers {{are restricted to}} the use of single type of <b>tyre.</b> A second <b>class,</b> called TKM 4-Stroke, run on performance oriented 200cc 4-stroke engines was introduced into the category in the early 2000s.|$|R
50|$|Online: Online Events {{consist of}} either {{multiplayer}} races from 2 up to 16 players (some {{of which are}} world scale), or online Time Trial events. Each event is limited in time, once finished, a ranking board shows the most successful players' scores. Top players' replay files are made available for download as ghost replays. Each week new events with their specific parameters (car <b>class,</b> <b>tyre</b> types, assistance level, etc.) {{are added to the}} list while older are closed.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{contained in}} this thesis explores how Lean and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementations can contribute {{for the success of}} the organization. The main objective was to find a mechanism to integrate Lean and ERP systems. The objective was defined {{as a result of a}} research problem, where the values generated from Lean activities were not clearly reflected in the value chain. Since all business processes are implemented in ERP, the argument was that the Lean value reflection of ERP would ensure the value is clearly distributed to the value stream. Argument was supported by the collected literature on Lean and ERP practices, observations and other sources such as organizational documents etc. The research was performed as a detailed case study of a world <b>class</b> <b>tyre</b> manufacturer and in order to clarify and generalize the Lean and ERP practices in the manufacturing industry, leading apparel manufacturer was evaluated. The research was identified as a purely qualitative one and the most challenging task was the data collection. Interviews, company documents and other sources were used in the data collection process and voice clips were captured during the process of interviews. Thereafter the data analysis was performed based on the themes identified through the generated transcripts. Data was analyzed with respect to the research question and finally the discussion was ended with some of the valuable findings that helped in order to develop a mechanism to integrate both Lean and ERP. This evaluation helped to confirm certain findings such as impact on value generation through Lean implementation and value distribution through ERP system. In holistic picture, the proposed mechanism to integrate Lean and ERP system will help organizations to strengthen their value chain. Since Lean concept is vastly used in manufacturing organization, the study is only focusing such organizations...|$|R
