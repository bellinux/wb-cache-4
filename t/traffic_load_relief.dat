40|$|Abstract—In {{cellular}} networks, {{the base}} station power con-sumption is not simply proportional to the <b>traffic</b> <b>loads</b> of its coverage. As the <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> fluctuates spatially and temporally, {{the base station}}s consequently suffer from heavy energy wastage when the <b>traffic</b> <b>loads</b> of their coverage are low. In this paper, we propose a grid-based energy saving scheme over predicted <b>traffic</b> <b>loads.</b> We firstly {{take advantage of the}} spatial-temporal pattern of <b>traffic</b> <b>loads</b> and employ the compressed sensing method to predict the future <b>traffic</b> <b>loads.</b> Then, we propose a grid-based energy saving scheme to improve the energy efficiency through turning some base stations into sleeping mode while ensuring the quality of service.

The throughput under different <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> is shown in the Figure 12 b. The throughput of the proposed method with appropriate sensing level - 92 dBm and conventional sensing level - 62 dBm keeps increasing with <b>traffic</b> <b>loads.</b> This is because with high <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> our proposed method does not have collisions due to hidden node. However, the throughput of the conventional method decreases as the <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> increases. The reason for this is the collisions due to the high <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> can not overcome.|$|R

40|$|Bridges are {{structures}} that propose the service life up to hundred years. However, the actual <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> models significantly {{differ from the}} characteristic load models used in the design. The analysis of former design codes of bridges used at the last century in Latvia showed the considerable increase of values of characteristic <b>traffic</b> <b>loads.</b> The <b>traffic</b> <b>loads</b> proposed in Eurocode 1 : “Actions on structures – Part 2 : <b>Traffic</b> <b>loads</b> on bridges” considerably increase the actual <b>traffic</b> <b>loads</b> passing Latvian bridges. Therefore, {{the use of the}} actual <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> models for assessment of the load carrying capacity of the older bridges will extend the service life and save financial founds for the maintenance of the bridges. Earlier, the obtaining of the correct traffic data was complicated. Today after implementation of the Weight-In-Motion system, it is possible to collect vehicle information without interruption of the traffic flow. This includes data of the number of axles, vehicle wheelbase, speed and axle loads that describes the actual loading cases on the roads and bridges. The analysis of the recorded data of Weight-In-Motion the system allowed to obtain the load distribution diagrams, determine the position of the heaviest axel, traffic speed and intensity values. The obtained results of statistical analysis of actual <b>traffic</b> <b>loads</b> allowed developing the integrated <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> models for bridges, based on actual <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> in Latvia.

The ACLDT {{was applied to the}} digital autopilot of a first stage boost vehicle with a single gimballed engine at the maximum dynamic pressure point of the trajec-tory, with the purpose of maximizing the <b>load</b> <b>relief</b> performance of the control system. The purpose of <b>load</b> <b>relief</b> feedback for a boost vehicle is to reduce aerodynamic loads on the vehicle during atmospheric flight by minimizing the angle of attack.

Subject to stability margin constraints, the ACLDT minimized the maximum vehicle angle of attack in a simulation of the vehicle tran-sient response to a ramped wind input profile. Since the aerodynamic loads on the vehicle are proportional to the angle of attack, this maximum angle of attack excursion gave a rea-sonable measure of <b>load</b> <b>relief</b> performance.

When the <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> is light (from 10 to 25 s), the energy consumption of DropTail {{is the same}} as BOB-RED. Conversely, both two mechanisms consume energy rapidly when <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> is getting heavier (from 25 to 40 s). Then, we can observe that residual energy of coordinator node 0 is higher than DropTail if using BOB-RED mechanism. This is because BOB-RED can lessen traffic congestion to decrease the energy consumption. As simulation result shows, using BOB-RED can get better energy consumption than DropTail when <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> is getting heavier.|$|R
40|$|Explosive {{data traffic}} growth {{leads to a}} {{continuous}} surge in capacity demands across mobile networks. In order to provision high network capacity, {{small cell base stations}} (SCBSs) are widely deployed. Owing to the close proximity to mobile users, SCBSs can effectively enhance the network capacity and offloading <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> from macro BSs (MBSs). However, the cost-effective backhaul may not be readily available for SCBSs, thus leading to backhaul constraints in small cell networks (SCNs). Enabling cache in BSs may mitigate the backhaul constraints in SCNs. Moreover, the dense deployment of SCBSs may incur excessive energy consumption. To alleviate brown power consumption, renewable energy will be explored to power BSs. In such a network, it is challenging to dynamically balance <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> among BSs to optimize the network utilities. In this paper, we investigate the <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> balancing in backhaul-constrained cache-enabled small cell networks powered by hybrid energy sources. We have proposed a network utility aware (NUA) <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> balancing scheme that optimizes user association to strike a tradeoff between the green power utilization and the traffic delivery latency. On balancing the <b>traffic</b> <b>load,</b> the proposed NUA <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> balancing scheme considers the green power utilization, the traffic delivery latency in both BSs and their backhaul, and the cache hit ratio. The NUA <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> balancing scheme allows dynamically adjusting the tradeoff between the green power utilization and the traffic delivery latency. We have proved the convergence and the optimality of the proposed NUA <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> balancing scheme.
