With that enlargement the Commission's membership increased to thirteen under the Ortoli Commission (the United Kingdom as a large member was granted two Commissioners), which dealt with the enlarged community during economic and international instability at that time. The external representation of the Community <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> when President Roy Jenkins, recruited to the presidency in January 1977 from his role as Home Secretary of the United Kingdom's Labour government, became the first President to attend a G8 summit {{on behalf of the}} Community.

Inouye, Matsunaga, and Mink's success led to the gradual acceptance of Japanese American leadership on the national stage, culminating in the appointments of Eric Shinseki and Norman Y. Mineta, the first Japanese American military chief of staff and federal cabinet secretary, respectively.|$|E

25|$|The pioneer {{work to the}} {{implementation}} of the phase-contrast method to X-ray physics was presented in 1965 by Ulrich Bonse and Michael Hart, Department of Materials Science and Engineering of Cornell University, New York. They presented a crystal interferometer, made from a large and highly perfect single crystal. Not less than 30 years later the Japanese scientists Atsushi Momose, Tohoru Takeda and co-workers adopted this idea and refined it for application in biological imaging, for instance by increasing the field of view with the assistance of new setup configurations and phase retrieval techniques. The Bonse–Hart interferometer provides several orders of magnitude higher sensitivity in biological samples than other phase-contrast techniques, but it cannot use conventional X-ray tubes because the crystals only accept a very narrow energy band of X-rays (ΔE/E ~ 10−4). In 2012, Han Wen and co-workers <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> by replacing the crystals with nanometric phase gratings. The gratings split and direct X-rays over a broad spectrum, thus lifting the restriction on the bandwidth of the X-ray source. They detected sub nanoradian refractive bending of X-rays in biological samples with a grating Bonse–Hart interferometer.|$|E
2500|$|During the Fifteen Years War (19301945), which from 1939 to 1945 {{was part}} of World War II, the Christians in Japan {{suffered}} severe conditions, the Orthodox Church especially. In 1945 after the Japanese surrender the Allied Occupation leaders had a generous attitude to Christian groups, given their predominantly American connections. As {{the majority of the}} Slavic- and Greek-Americans would attend local Orthodox Christian parishes, the Orthodox Christian community in Japan <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward.</b> During the war the Japanese Orthodox Church had had almost no foreign contact. After the war instead of the Russian Orthodox Church the precursors of the Orthodox Church in America (OCA) helped re-invigorate the Japanese Orthodox Church.

2500|$|After Derbyshire County Cricket Club was established, Platts {{played in}} the club's first match in the 1871 season against Lancashire in May, and for {{thirteen}} years thereafter. Although undistinguished in the first game, he came in to bowl in the second match that season and took 5 for 34. During the 1872 season he took 5–51 in the first innings of the second match against Lancashire. He took four wickets in the 1873 season, while his batting scores improved significantly in the 1874 season. All through these early years Platt appeared in matches involving All England XIs and United South of England XIs sometimes for them and sometimes against them. He was usually against the side in which W. G. Grace was playing. At Birmingham in 1874 he was bowled by Grace, but in 1876, turning out for an assortment of clubs including Swansea, Barrow, Birmingham and Stockport, he took Grace's wicket twice. For Derbyshire in the 1876 season he was top scorer with 235. His first-class bowling <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> and he took 6–68 for Derbyshire against Kent. In the 1877 season he made his top score of 115 against Hampshire, which was the club's first century, and topped the scoring for Derbyshire again with 432. He took 5–18 against Lancashire that year. He continued playing other matches for and against other clubs, although this tailed out in the early 1880s. By 1881 he was running the [...] "Rose and Crown" [...] public house at Chellaston {{as well as being}} a professional cricketer.|$|E

2500|$|Harald Høffding {{wrote an}} article about him in A brief history of modern {{philosophy}} (1900). Høffding mentioned Kierkegaard in Philosophy of Religion 1906, and the American Journal of Theology (1908) printed an article about Hoffding's Philosophy of Religion. Then Høffding repented of his previous convictions in The problems of philosophy (1913). Høffding was also {{a friend of the}} American philosopher William James, and although James had not read Kierkegaard's works, as they were not yet translated into English, he attended the lectures about Kierkegaard by Høffding and agreed with much of those lectures. James' favorite quote from Kierkegaard came from Høffding: [...] "We live forwards but we understand backwards". William James wrote:"We live forward, we understand backward, said a Danish writer; and to understand life by concepts is to arrest its movement, cutting it up into bits as if with scissors, and, immobilizing these in our logical [...] where, comparing them as dried specimens, we can ascertain which of them statically includes or excludes which other. This treatment supposes life to have already accomplished itself, for the concepts, being so many views taken after the fact, are retrospective and post mortem. Nevertheless, we can draw conclusions from them and project them into the future. We cannot learn from them how life made itself go, or how it will make itself go; but, on the supposition that its ways of making itself go are unchanging, we can calculate what positions of imagined arrest it will exhibit hereafter under given conditions." [...] William James, A Pluralistic Universe, 1909, p. 244 Kierkegaard wrote of moving forward past the irresolute good intention:The yes of the promise is sleep-inducing, but the no, spoken and therefore audible to oneself, is awakening, and repentance is usually not far away. The one who says, [...] "I will, sir," [...] is at the same moment pleased with himself; the one who says no becomes almost afraid of himself. But this difference if very significant in the first moment and very decisive in the next moment; yet if the first moment is the judgment of the momentary, the second moment is the judgment of eternity. This is precisely why the world is so inclined to promises, inasmuch as the world is the momentary, and at the moment a promise looks very good. This is why eternity is suspicious of promises, just as it is suspicious of everything momentary. And so it is also with the one who, rich in good intentions and quick to promise, moves backward further and further away from the good. By means of the intention and the promise, he is facing {{in the direction of the}} good, is turned toward the good but is moving backward further and further away from it. With every renewed intention and promise it looks as if he <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>forward,</b> and yet he is not merely standing still, but he is actually taking a step backward. The intention taken in vain, the unfulfilled promise, leaves despondency, dejection, that in turn perhaps soon blazes up into an even more vehement intention, which leaves only greater listlessness. Just as the alcoholic continually needs a stronger and stronger stimulant-in order to become intoxicated, likewise the one who has become addicted to promises and good intentions continually needs more and more stimulation-in order to go backward.
