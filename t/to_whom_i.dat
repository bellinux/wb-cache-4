25|$|The Rev. Thomas Binney, <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> brought {{letters from}} Rev. Mr. Roaf, my pastor, {{received}} me most kindly. Mrs. Binney {{acted as if}} we had been acquainted for the preceding six-and-twenty years; and, being the first London lady with whom I had the pleasure of acquaintance, I saw in her what I have since seen in English people of all ranks, who are really genteel - a most skilful and yet an indescribably easy way of making one feel perfectly at case with them. I cannot tell how it is done.|$|E
25|$|The loss is {{irreparable}} {{in every}} point of view: {{with him is}} gone all true philosophy, all publick virtue; {{there is nothing left}} but factious schemes and time-serving manoeuvres, contending one with the other, which shall do most mischief—not one English sentiment, not one statesmanlike idea—this is the publick loss. the private one is of everything that was warm, zealous, partial, where once he had placed his affections; for my own part, I feel it is the loss, not of a friend, but of a father; of one <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> looked up for advice and instruction; and who gave them with the interest and fidelity of a parent.|$|E

25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

500|$|Though it largely escaped {{notice when}} first published, Holmes {{eventually}} {{came under attack}} by two distinguished professors of obstetrics—Hugh L. Hodge and Charles D. Meigs—who adamantly denied his theory of contagion. In 1855, Holmes chose to republish the essay {{in the form of}} a pamphlet under the new title Puerperal Fever as a Private Pestilence. In a new introduction, in which Holmes directly addressed his opponents, he wrote: [...] "I had rather rescue one mother from being poisoned by her attendant, than claim to have saved forty out of fifty patients <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> had carried the disease." [...] He added, [...] "I beg to be heard in behalf of the women whose lives are at stake, until some stronger voice shall plead for them." [...] The then controversial work is now considered a landmark in germ theory of disease.|$|E

2500|$|Chadwick found a {{place for}} Mayer on a flight to Britain which left Ruzyně Airport on 14 March 1939, one day before German troops marched into Prague. He also {{arranged}} {{for her to be}} sponsored by his widowed mother and to live, at first, with his own family in Swanage.

2500|$|Both {{direct and}} {{indirect}} relative particles can be used simply for emphasis, often in {{answer to a question}} or as a way of disagreeing with a statement. For instance, the Welsh example above, [...] "y dyn a welais" [...] means not only [...] "the man whom I saw", but also [...] "it was the man (and not anyone else) I saw"; and [...] "y dyn y rhois y llyfr iddo" [...] can likewise mean [...] "it was the man (and not anyone else) <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> gave the book".|$|E
2500|$|During the war, André Breton, who {{had trained}} in {{medicine}} and psychiatry, served in a neurological hospital where he used Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic methods with soldiers suffering from shell-shock. Meeting the young writer Jacques Vaché, Breton felt that Vaché was the spiritual son of writer and pataphysics founder Alfred Jarry. [...] He admired the young writer's anti-social attitude and disdain for established artistic tradition. Later Breton wrote, [...] "In literature, I was successively taken with Rimbaud, with Jarry, with Apollinaire, with Nouveau, with Lautréamont, but it is Jacques Vaché <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> owe the most." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{relative}} pronoun pair [...] "who" [...] and [...] "whom", the subjective case form ("who") is used {{if it is}} the subject of {{the relative}} clause ("He is the policeman who saw me"); and, in formal usage, the objective case form ("whom") {{if it is the}} object of the verb or preposition in the relative clause ("He is the policeman whom I saw", [...] "He is the policeman whom I talked to", [...] "He is the policeman <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> talked"); but in informal usage [...] "whom" [...] is often replaced by [...] "who".|$|E

2500|$|The David Livingstone Centre in Blantyre celebrates {{his life}} and is based in the house {{in which he was}} born, {{on the site of the}} mill in which he started his working life. His Christian faith is evident in his journal, in which one entry reads: [...] "I place no value on {{anything}} I have or may possess, except in relation to the kingdom of Christ. If anything will advance the interests of the kingdom, it shall be given away or kept, only as by giving or keeping it I shall promote the glory of Him <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> owe all my hopes in time and eternity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ernestine was a nosy, condescending {{telephone}} operator who generally treated customers with little sympathy. Ernestine often snorted when she let loose a barbed response or heard something salacious; she also wore {{her hair in}} a 1940s hairstyle with a hairnet, although the character was contemporary. Her opening lines were often the comical [...] "one ringy dingy... two ringy dingy", and, [...] "is this the party <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> am speaking?" [...] In the sketches, Ernestine was usually at her switchboard taking calls. She occasionally called her boyfriend, Vito, a telephone repair man, or her pal Phoenicia, another operator. Tomlin reprised the role in 2016 for a TV ad as part of PETA's campaign against SeaWorld, Tomlin has also reprised the role on several episodes of Sesame Street.|$|E
2500|$|Mira's death left Baciu in near-complete {{isolation}} from the Romanian-speaking public. As he later noted: [...] "I literally have no one <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> would read the things I write. There are at most ten Romanian speakers living in Honolulu and none of them, absolutely none, has ever been to a bookstore or a library to peek into, or to ask for, or to purchase a single book of poetry." [...] He honored her memory with a 1979 semi-autobiographical novel, eponymously titled Mira. A new volume of his memoirs saw print in Honolulu in 1980, as Praful de pe tobă ("The Dust on the Drum"). It was taped by Virgil Ierunca and serialized by Radio Free Europe (RFE), which broadcast clandestinely into Romania.|$|E

Whatever happens I never can forget, my dearest Fitz, that you are the friend in the world whom I most esteem, for whom I would sacrifice every thing that one man ought to sacrifice to another. I know that the properest conduct in such a situation would be to say nothing, nor to inquire any thing from any of my old friends, and so I shall do in regard to all others, but I feel you to be an exception with respect to me to all general rules, I am sure your friendship has been so. God bless you, my dear Fitz.|$|E
2500|$|Loos, Emerson {{and fellow}} writer Frances Marion {{migrated}} to New York as a group, Loos and Emerson sharing a leased mansion in Great Neck, Long Island. Loos desperately wanted Marion as chaperone, as {{she found herself}} attracted to Emerson. He would readily admit that he [...] "had never been, nor could be, faithful to any one female." [...] Loos convinced herself that he would {{see that she was}} different from all his other girls, and that behind his outwardly dull exterior was a great mind. She would be wrong on both counts. She would later write: [...] "I had set my sights on a man of brains, <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> could look up", she lamented, [...] "but what a terrible let down it would be to find out that I was smarter than he was." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Celtic {{languages}} (at {{least the}} modern Insular Celtic languages) distinguish {{two types of}} relative clause: direct relative clauses and indirect relative clauses. A direct relative clause is used where the relativized element is the subject or the direct object of its clause (e.g. [...] "the man who saw me", [...] "the man whom I saw"), while an indirect relative clause is used where the relativized element is a genitival (e.g. [...] "the man whose daughter is in the hospital") or {{is the object of}} a preposition (e.g. [...] "the man <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> gave the book"). Direct relative clauses are formed with a relative pronoun (unmarked for case) at the beginning; a gap (in terms of syntactic theory, a trace, indicated by (t) in the examples below) is left in the relative clause at the pronoun's expected position.|$|E
