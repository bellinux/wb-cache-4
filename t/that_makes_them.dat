5|$|Although {{bicycles}} and motorcycles can {{appear to be}} simple mechanisms with only four major moving parts (frame, fork, and two wheels), these parts are arranged in a way <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> complicated to analyze. While it is an observable fact that bikes can be ridden even when the gyroscopic effects of their wheels are canceled out, {{the hypothesis that the}} gyroscopic effects of the wheels are what keep a bike upright is common in print and online.|$|E

5|$|Caprica-Six and Boomer {{are next}} shown conversing with Number Three. While the three move up a stairwell, {{explosives}} {{set by the}} resistance led by Samuel T. Anders (Michael Trucco) detonate, trapping Anders, Three, Boomer, and Caprica-Six in a parking garage. While Anders is originally shielded and hidden by the blast, Caprica-Six breaks her leg. Number Three offers to euthanize her, but Caprica-Six refuses as she suspects that Number Three will {{take the opportunity to}} box her. Shortly afterwards, the three find Anders who Number Three intends to kill before being stopped by Boomer and Caprica-Six. As Number Three goads them, Boomer and Caprica-Six understand that their unique view of humanity through their love for Baltar and Galen Tyrol gives them a perspective <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> a threat to the Cylon status-quo. When Number Three attempts to kill Anders, she is killed by Caprica-Six who, along with Boomer, allow Anders to escape. Recognizing that it will take some time for Number Three to resurrect and report them, Caprica-Six and Boomer form a pact to change the Cylon perspective of humanity together before finally being rescued from the collapsed parking garage by the other Cylons.|$|E
5|$|In 2259, Enterprise {{receives}} a distress {{call from a}} space station harvesting {{the power of a}} binary star. There is too much interference to beam the crew aboard, so Kirk and Spock (voiced by Zachary Quinto) take a shuttle to rescue the crew. They encounter T'Mar, a childhood friend of Spock, who explains they were gathering energy to power the Helios device, which would speed up the terraforming of New Vulcan; the team inadvertently opened a rip in the fabric of space. Beaming to New Vulcan, Kirk and Spock meet with T'Mar's father Surok, who explains the station's power from the base was lost after they were attacked by creatures—who call themselves the Gorn— from the rip. The Gorn infect some of the crew with a virus <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> aggressive. Kirk and Spock enter the locked down sections of the base to recover the infected survivors, but are unable to stop the Gorn from stealing the Helios device and kidnapping Surok.|$|E

5|$|Females of the {{jumping spider}} Portia fimbriata have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. The Queensland variety is {{typically}} {{smaller than the}} Northern Territory variety. The cephalothorax is about 4millimetres long and 3millimetres wide, and the abdomen about 4millimetres long and 2.2millimetres wide. The front of the cephalothorax is large and angular, and the face is broad, high and flat. In Australia and Taiwan, both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("jaws"), a brown underside, and dark brown palps with white hairs. Both sexes also have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair. However, the female has a white fringe just above the chelicerae, while the back half of the male's cephalothorax has a white band round the bottom edge and a white groove down the back. While male spiders' palps are larger than females', the palps of P.fimbriata females have a fringe of hair <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> look about as larger as males'. The abdomens of both sexes are dark brown, with white spots on the upper side. Wanless' female from New Guinea has an orange carapace and chelicerae with sooty markings, palps mainly light yellow, legs orange-brown legs, and abdomen light yellow. Wanless also found a male from the Amboina area in Indonesia, showing an orange-brown carapace and chelicerae, yellow-brown to orange-brown palps, orange-brown legs and a light yellowish abdomen.|$|E

25|$|Environmental {{and social}} factors are also {{thought to have}} a {{significant}} influence on the onset of NPD.
