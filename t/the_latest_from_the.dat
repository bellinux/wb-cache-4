Bush, Abdul-Malik said in February 2005: [...] "Our whole community is under siege. They don't see this as a case of criminality. They see it as a civil rights case. As a frontal attack on their community." [...] He added: [...] "The feeling I get here on a daily basis must be {{what it was like to}} be a member of Martin Luther King Jr.'s church following the case of Rosa Parks. People always ask, 'What is <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> courthouse?'" [...] Abdul-Malik accused the government of singling out Abu Ali to stir anti-Muslim sentiment. Abu Ali was convicted in 2005 of providing material support to the al-Qaeda terrorist network, and conspiracy to assassinate President Bush, and is serving a life sentence. [...] When in April 2005 Ali al-Timimi of Fairfax, Virginia, an American-born Muslim cleric, was convicted of inciting followers to wage war against the US just days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and of recruiting for the Pakistani terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Toiba, and the paintball terrorist cell, Abdul-Malik said: [...] "There is a view many Muslims have when they come to America that you could not be arrested for something you say. But now they have discovered they are not free to speak their minds. And if our opinions are out of vogue in the current climate, we feel we are all at risk." [...] Al-Timimi was sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
