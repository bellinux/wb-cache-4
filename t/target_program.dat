25|$|While {{this method}} greatly {{improves}} {{the chances that}} an attack will be successful, it is not without problems. Exploits using this technique still must rely on some amount of luck that they will guess offsets on the stack that are within the NOP-sled region. An incorrect guess will usually result in the <b>target</b> <b>program</b> crashing and could alert the system administrator to the attacker's activities. Another {{problem is that the}} NOP-sled requires a much larger amount of memory in which to hold a NOP-sled large enough to be of any use. This can be a problem when the allocated size of the affected buffer is too small and the current depth of the stack is shallow (i.e. there is not much space {{from the end of the}} current stack frame to the start of the stack). Despite its problems, the NOP-sled is often the only method that will work for a given platform, environment, or situation; as such it is still an important technique.|$|E

5000|$|The basic {{instruction}} simulation {{technique is}} the same regardless of purpose: first execute the monitoring program passing {{the name of the}} <b>target</b> <b>program</b> as an additional input parameter. The <b>target</b> <b>program</b> is then loaded into memory, but control is never passed to the code. Instead, the entry point within the loaded program is calculated, and a pseudo program status word (PSW) is set to this location. A set of pseudo registers are set to what they would have contained if the program had been given control directly.|$|E

The biggest weakness of this technique is that these programs send their keystrokes directly to the <b>target</b> <b>program.</b> However, this can be overcome by using the 'alternating' technique described below, i.e. sending mouse clicks to non-responsive areas of the <b>target</b> <b>program,</b> sending meaningless keys, sending another mouse click to target area (e.g. password field) and switching back-and-forth.|$|E

30|$|One {{advantage}} of <b>targeted</b> <b>programs</b> {{is that they}} are generally more cost-effective than universal <b>programs</b> (Offord, 2000). <b>Targeted</b> prevention <b>programs</b> focus on disorders or behavioral issues that might only impact {{a small percentage of the}} entire population. Therefore, it is theoretically most efficient to only offer preventative interventions to this high-risk group, as opposed to all members of a given population. Additionally, targeted interventions can focus more intently on symptoms or risk factors that are experienced by every member in a group. However, <b>targeted</b> <b>programs</b> are not inherently the most cost-effective in every circumstance given the cost of screening for risk factors and the challenges associated with correctly identifying individuals who would benefit from such programs.|$|R
