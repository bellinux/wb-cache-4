5|$|When American extremists loyal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> group Islamic Caliphate Organization (ICO) kidnap a {{suburban}} family, Underwood allows Conway {{to negotiate with}} them, making his opponent look like a hero - and then releases NSA data that proves Conway illegally influenced Congress. Soon afterward, however, Underwood is hit with two crises at once: ICO's leader orders his followers to kill one of the hostages, while journalist Tom Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver) exposes Underwood's crimes in the Washington Herald. Facing disgrace and possible impeachment, Underwood decides to declare war on ICO and allow the public to see the hostage die in order to distract from the scandal and create an atmosphere of widespread fear that he and Claire can exploit {{in the weeks before}} the election.|$|E

25|$|The {{mission of}} the Explosive Detector Dog (EDD) Teams is the {{protection}} of life and property and providing a strong visible and psychological deterrence against criminal and terrorist acts. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> attacks of September 11, 2001, the FPS had a minimal program of 10 EDD Teams located in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. Since that time, the FPS EDD program has expanded to more than 60 teams nationwide.|$|E
25|$|Years {{later on}} 14 February 2017, President Maduro ordered cable {{providers}} to take CNN en Español off the air, days after CNN aired {{an investigation into}} the alleged fraudulent issuing of Venezuelan passports and visas.

50|$|Double Agent {{introduces}} a morality factor: Fisher may now encounter conflicting objectives between his superiors and <b>the</b> <b>terrorists.</b> For example, <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> may assign {{a mission to}} assassinate someone, while the NSA simultaneously instructs <b>the</b> player <b>to</b> prevent <b>the</b> assassination. This creates a delicate balancing act between gaining the trust of <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> and fulfilling <b>the</b> mission assignments. In addition, Fisher must not do anything <b>to</b> reveal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> {{that he is a}} double agent (such as let himself be seen with an NSA gadget), otherwise he will lose instantly.|$|R

25|$|In late 2001, the Directorate against Terrorism {{reported}} that the Shining Path, a terrorist movement which has been active since the eighties, was organizing along new fronts and infiltrating protests, blocking highways, and organizing student marches.

25|$|After {{many years}} of {{suspended}} animation, Apocalypse awakens nearly a century earlier than planned due {{to the arrival of}} the time-traveling mutant Cable (ironically, Cable had traveled to this point in time hoping to prevent the ancient mutant awakening). Apocalypse decides the Earth is ready for further examination and testing. He grants superhuman powers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> known as Moses Magnum, who then tests the X-Men and the Avengers. Apocalypse later briefly employs the Alliance of Evil to capture the mutant Michael Nowlan, who can boost the power of other mutants. This plan brings Apocalypse into direct conflict with the first incarnation of X-Factor, when the team was composed of the original X-Men.|$|E

500|$|Lieber's most {{productive}} season came in 2001. On May 24, he one-hit the Cincinnati Reds, 3–0, ending the team's NL-record streak of 208 {{games in a}} row without being shut out, throwing just 78 pitches. From June 16 to July 15, he won six straight games. He was named an All-Star for the first and only time in his career. In his final start of the season on October 3, he allowed five runs in six innings but still earned his 20th win of the season as the Cubs beat the Reds 137. In 34 starts, Lieber recorded a career-high 20 victories to go with just six losses, posted a 3.80 ERA, and struck out 148 as opposed to 41 walks. His 20 wins ranked fourth in the league (behind Matt Morris's and Schilling's 22 and Johnson's 21), his [...] innings pitched ranked fifth in the league, and his five complete games tied for second in the league with Javier Vázquez (behind Johnson's six). He finished fourth in the NL Cy Young Award vote, behind Johnson, Schilling, and Morris. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 and the week-long break in the baseball season, Lieber became the first Cubs pitcher to start consecutive contests since Scott Sanderson on May 18 and May 20 of 1986.|$|E

Some amongst the western media had even falsely accusing the party of colluding with <b>the</b> <b>terrorists,</b> due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that the authorities were unable <b>to</b> arrest <b>the</b> <b>terrorists.</b> Under <b>the</b> guidance of British and U.S. experts, the government intensified its efforts and finally, {{with a string of}} events starting at 29 June 2002, the 17N members were captured and put to trial.|$|R
2500|$|Also in October, Andrew Parker, {{director}} general of the UK Security Service, maintained that the exposing of intelligence techniques had given extremists <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> evade <b>the</b> intelligence agencies; he said, [...] "It causes enormous damage <b>to</b> make public <b>the</b> reach and limits of GCHQ techniques.

25|$|Pakistan {{has had a}} {{moratorium}} on executions since 2008. Currently there are approximately 800 people on death row in Pakistan in terrorism related cases.

2500|$|India's defence {{strategy}} from 1974 was, in {{the words}} of former defence minister George Fernandes, “a non-aggressive, non-provocative defense policy,” centred around [...] "holding corps" [...] to halt hostile advances. In response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001, India initiated a full mobilisation. Taking almost a month, the slow mobilisation demonstrated the weakness of India's then current policy.
