500|$|Hazel sees Doc {{even more}} dispirited than before, and asks Suzy for an explanation. Suzy {{says that she}} is not willing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> be with Doc, but [...] "if he was sick or if he bust his leg or an arm or something", she would go to him and bring him soup. The wheels in Hazel's head begin unaccustomed turnings, and {{sometime}} later when Mac passes Hazel on the street, Mac is surprised to see his friend carrying a baseball bat. When the scene returns to Doc's lab, he is receiving treatment from a real doctor and trying to puzzle out how he broke his arm. Suzy comes in, and makes soup for him as Hazel and Mac take turns watching at the keyhole. Doc admits that he needs and loves Suzy, and they embrace. As Fauna and the girls arrive, so do the other Flophouse boys, and Mac gives Doc what was bought with the raffle money—the largest (tele)scope in the catalog. ("Finale") ...|$|E
2500|$|Snow's {{commitments}} to multiple sports placed {{a strain on}} his time. [...] As a senior in 1902, Snow excelled in the shot put. [...] Seeking {{to focus on the}} shot put, Snow resigned the captaincy of the baseball team in February 1902. [...] At the time, Snow told a reporter:"A captain ought to be on the field during all practice hours, and if I filled the position I would not feel at liberty to leave the diamond <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> take coaching for a field event. [...] Besides, I have college work that keeps me busy until 5 o'clock three times a week. [...] I will do all I can for the baseball team, however, and there is nothing but good feelings between all the candidates." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{detachment}} of 66 {{men of the}} 1st Cavalry Regiment and 61 men of Company G under [...] of the 8th Cavalry had tracked the Apaches into the Chiricahua Mountains and eventually to an engagement what some called the [...] "Campaign of the Rocky Mesa." [...] The combined troops were led by Captain Reuben F. Bernard of the 1st Cavalry. The cool overcast day became [...] "a miserable day, cold with rain and hail, when the cavalrymen attacked." [...] The Apaches were well entrenched and defending behind rocks and boulders {{near the top of}} a ridge. The soldiers had to climb a defile or a steep-sided and narrow passage of loose slick rocks <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> around as they moved up toward the top of the mesa. More than one fell due to the weather conditions. Under these deplorable conditions Schroeter and his fellow soldiers advanced upwards toward the hostile Indians.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2007, {{during a}} news conference in Staten Island, Bloomberg {{declared}} his strong opposition to legislation proposed in Congress calling for a clear timetable for troop withdrawal. He said, [...] "We ask our young men and women <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> to fight, {{and if you have a}} deadline knowing they're pulling out, how can you expect them to defend this country? How can you expect them to go out and put their lives at risk? I just think that's untenable and that this is not a responsible piece of legislation. It is totally separate of how we're conducting the war. It's totally separate of whether we should have been there. The issue that you asked about is plain and simple: Should the Congress pass a law forcing the president to withdraw troops at a given point in time? I think that is not something that is in the country's interest or in the military's interest." ...|$|E
2500|$|William Travers sarcastically {{referred}} {{to him as a}} [...] "genius" [...] and Charlotte Godley (the wife of [...] "father of Canterbury" [...] John Robert Godley) described Campbell in letters to her mother by saying:"There is a certain old Colonel Campbell, who had many dealings with the C. Assoc. in early days, and ended by quarrelling with everyone and writing an insulting letter to Lord Lyttelton, after innumerable statements on his part {{had turned out to be}} perfectly false... He is naturally predisposed to dislike the plan, and the Colonists, and goes about abusing the place, the land, and all belonging to it, to anyone who will listen to him. The new-comers are his especial prey...he is a very bad element in our society. He is now going over to Akaroa to decide summarily certain claims of some of the old settlers there, and my husband intends <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> watch what he is about; he can hardly help making mistakes, as he has no knowledge whatever of his subject... vexatious, underhand way of doing business... an overweening idea of his own importance..." ...|$|E
2500|$|From this, Thurston {{was able}} to kick to Billy Slater, setting up the first four-pointer which Thurston also {{converted}} to make the score 8–2. A try attempt by Cooper Cronk was controversially [...] disallowed by the video referee, who ruled Isaac Luke {{had been able to}} stop the ball coming into contact with the in-goal grass while also giving New Zealand a penalty against Andrew Fifita for 'driving' Luke. Cronk didn't have to wait long to score though, as a few minutes later Darius Boyd got around Whare and raced down the wing before putting in a miss-kicked grubber which Cronk managed to find <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> score despite a desperate Kevin Locke tackle. Thurston kicked his 3rd goal from 3 attempts to take the score out to 14–2. Thurston's conversion of Cronk's try saw him overtake Michael Cronin as Australia's highest point scorer in test match football. Manu Vatuvei's attacking run for New Zealand saw him pushed over the sideline 5 metres out by 5 desperate Australian defenders, and an offside penalty at the 35 minute mark gave Thurston another kick to bring the score out to 16–2 at halftime.|$|E
