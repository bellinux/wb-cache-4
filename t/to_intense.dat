5|$|During summer, the Bay of Bengal {{is subject}} <b>to</b> <b>intense</b> heating, {{giving rise to}} humid and {{unstable}} air masses that morph into cyclones. The 1737 Calcutta cyclone, the 1970 Bhola cyclone, and the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone rank among the most powerful cyclones to strike India, devastating the coasts of eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh. Widespread death and property destruction are reported {{every year in the}} exposed coastal states of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. India's western coast, bordering the more placid Arabian Sea, experiences cyclones only rarely; these mainly strike Gujarat and, less frequently, Kerala.|$|E

5|$|When {{added to}} glass, thorium dioxide helps {{increase}} its refractive index and decrease dispersion. Such glass finds application in high-quality lenses for cameras and scientific instruments.

Yellowed lenses may be restored to their original colourless state by lengthy exposure <b>to</b> <b>intense</b> ultraviolet radiation. Thorium dioxide has since been replaced by rare-earth oxides in this application, as they provide similar effects and are not radioactive.|$|E
5|$|Almost all the LCP(R)s in {{the first}} wave veered off course to the left, landing between Siki Creek and the rocks of the {{headland}} between Siki Cove and Arndt Point. All the boats landed successfully except for one carrying 11 Platoon of the 2/15th Infantry Battalion, which had broken down and was towed by the LCP(R) carrying 10 Platoon, delaying both. Another LCP(R) appeared and took the platoon in. But {{only three of the}} sixteen landed on Scarlet Beach. In some ways this was good, as it meant that the plywood landing craft were not subjected <b>to</b> <b>intense</b> machine gun fire, which might have caused heavy casualties; but there were still serious disadvantages to landing on the wrong beach. On the right, Captain T. C. Sheldon's B Company, 2/17th Infantry Battalion, accompanied by the anti-tank platoon and 10 Platoon the Papuan Infantry Battalion, landed roughly where they were supposed to, and pushed on to their objective, North Hill.|$|E
5|$|Colonial {{rule in the}} Congo {{began in}} the late 19th century. King Leopold II of Belgium, {{frustrated}} by Belgium's lack of international power and prestige, attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexplored Congo Basin. The Belgian government's ambivalence about the idea led Leopold to eventually create the colony on his own account. With support from a number of Western countries, who viewed Leopold as a useful buffer between rival colonial powers, Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony, the Congo Free State, in 1885. By the turn of the century, however, the violence of Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and the ruthless system of economic extraction had led <b>to</b> <b>intense</b> diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country, which it did in 1908, creating the Belgian Congo.|$|E

50|$|Women who {{experience}} D-MER can experience {{a wide range}} of negative emotions that fall on what {{is referred to as the}} Spectrum of D-MER. These emotions usually fall under three categories, including despondency, anxiety and aggression. The D-MER spectrum of emotions can occur at any of several intensities, without changing the type of emotion. For example, a woman may experience a sense of depression and this feeling can range from mild homesickness or wistfulness <b>to</b> more <b>intense</b> feelings of hopelessness and self-loathing. Similarly, anxiety may range from restlessness <b>to</b> more <b>intense</b> panic and dread. Anger, the least likely of the three, may range from tension and agitation <b>to</b> more <b>intense</b> feelings of hostility and aggression.|$|R

5|$|Cyclone Jokwe {{remained}} {{over land}} for about 18hours before emerging into the Mozambique Channel, weakening quickly to tropical storm status. Upon reaching open waters, convection {{increased over the}} center, and late on March 9 Jokwe re-intensified to a tropical cyclone as an eye reappeared on satellite imagery. The cyclone turned to the south-southeast, around the periphery of a ridge to its east. An upper-level low to its south produced good outflow which, in combination with warm waters, allowed Jokwe to re-intensify. Late on March 10, the storm passed about 35km (21mi) east of Europa Island, and shortly thereafter the MFR upgraded Jokwe <b>to</b> <b>intense</b> tropical cyclone status with winds of 170km/h (105mph). Subsequently, an increase in wind shear caused a steady weakening trend, and by March 12 Jokwe weakened to tropical storm status as its center became partially exposed from the deep convection; at the same time, the storm turned to the southwest.|$|E

5|$|Half of Harris's {{credited}} kills {{were achieved}} in October, coinciding with Japanese planners' final attempt at provoking a decisive {{battle with the}} American fleet. On October 1, 1944, while still anchored at Ulithi, Intrepid was made Admiral Bogan's flagship. The carrier disembarked from harbor on October 7 {{to head for the}} waters southeast of Okinawa. It was scheduled to be part of strikes on Okinawa, the Ryukyus and Luzon leading up to a planned invasion of Leyte. These strikes began on October 10, targeting Okinawan airfields including Naha, Yontan and Ie Shima, as well as nearby shipping. Anti-aircraft fire ranged from meager <b>to</b> <b>intense</b> with flak worsening throughout the day. But, regardless of strike time, or target, there was virtually no aerial opposition encountered.|$|E

5|$|In the Middle-Atlantic states, {{it caused}} little injury overall, though many boats and ships were capsized. To {{the north in}} New England, many churches endured {{significant}} damage, and shipwrecks led to 15deaths, with one other death owing to a building collapse. Due <b>to</b> <b>intense</b> gusts, hundreds of trees were uprooted and many buildings were unroofed. Agriculture, shipping, timber, and livestock industries also suffered substantial impairment, with considerable injury experienced by barns, crops, watercraft, timber, and livestock. Farther north, entire swaths of forest were leveled, and heavy snow blocked roads, paths, and turnpikes. Fruit orchards and sugar groves endured {{the worst of the}} storm, reducing the season's harvests. Private properties generally suffered damage to roofs, windows, and chimneys; several buildings throughout the region were reported to have collapsed. Overall, approximately $100,000 in damage and more than 16deaths were recorded.|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan {{appears in}} several StarCraft novels that greatly expand her backstory {{before the first}} StarCraft game. The novel Uprising portrays Kerrigan's {{training}} as a Ghost assassin from an early age, where she is subjected <b>to</b> <b>intense</b> psychological abuse from her Confederate trainer, Lieutenant Rumm. When {{she was a young}} girl, an accident, most likely involving her powers, kills her mother and puts her father in a vegetative state. Consequently, Kerrigan is terrified to use her psionic abilities, and refuses Rumm's demands to show her power, even when he threatens to kill her father. Kerrigan is eventually subdued with mental implants and used as a top Confederate assassin until she is rescued by Arcturus Mengsk. The novels Liberty's Crusade and Queen of Blades provide novelisations for Kerrigan's actions in Episodes I and II of StarCraft respectively. Liberty's Crusade develops the implied relationship between Jim Raynor and Kerrigan, while Queen of Blades serves to demonstrate Kerrigan's complete transformation by the Zerg, her removal of her inhibitions and morality, and its effect on her former love, Raynor.|$|E
5|$|On March 5, 1975, the North Vietnamese 2nd Army Corps officially {{commenced}} {{its campaign}} against South Vietnamese forces of I Corps. The opening {{shots of the}} campaign was marked by an attack on South Vietnamese military convoys on Mount Hai Van, {{and the destruction of}} An Lo Bridge on National Highway 1, located north of Huế. Positions held by the ARVN 913th Regional Force at Dong Ong Do and Hill-368 also came under attack, as Phu Bai Airbase was subjected <b>to</b> <b>intense</b> artillery bombardment. While the South Vietnamese were busy dealing with those attacks, General Nguyen Huu An secretly redeployed the 325th Division and the 9th Regiment of the 304th Division, from Quảng Trị towards Huế in the south. The 46th and 271st Regiment then moved into positions previously held by the 325th Division and 9th Regiment. And, to fool South Vietnamese intelligence agencies, the North Vietnamese also moved tank and artillery units to Cua Viet, Thanh Hoi and Ai Tu to cover their main thrust.|$|E
