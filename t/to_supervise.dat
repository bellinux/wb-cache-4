5|$|On 5 June 1956 two FDA {{officials}} {{arrived at}} Orgonon <b>to</b> <b>supervise</b> {{the destruction of}} the accumulators. Most of them had been sold by that time and another 50 were with Silvert in New York. Only three were at Orgonon. The FDA agents were not allowed to destroy them, only <b>to</b> <b>supervise</b> the destruction, so Reich's friends and his son, Peter, chopped them up with axes as the agents watched. Once they were destroyed, Reich placed an American flag on top of them.|$|E

Diệm {{and his younger}} brother and chief adviser, Ngô Đình Nhu, agreed to surrender, and coup plotter Đôn promised them safe passage out of the country. In the meantime, Minh left Joint General Staff (JGS) {{headquarters}} and travelled to Gia Long Palace in a sedan, accompanied by Nhung.

40|$|The minimum {{description}} length (MDL) {{principle in}} supervised learning is studied. One {{of the most}} important theories for the MDL principle is Barron and Cover's theory (BC theory), which gives a mathematical justification of the MDL principle. The original BC theory, however, can be applied <b>to</b> <b>supervised</b> learning only approximately and limitedly. Though Barron et al. recently succeeded in removing a similar approximation in case of unsupervised learning, their idea cannot be essentially applied <b>to</b> <b>supervised</b> learning in general. To overcome this issue, an extension of BC theory <b>to</b> <b>supervised</b> learning is proposed. The derived risk bound has several advantages inherited from the original BC theory. First, the risk bound holds for finite sample size. Second, it requires remarkably few assumptions. Third, the risk bound has a form of redundancy of the two-stage code for the MDL procedure. Hence, the proposed extension gives a mathematical justification of the MDL principle <b>to</b> <b>supervised</b> learning like the original BC theory. As an important example of application, new risk and (probabilistic) regret bounds of lasso with random design are derived. The derived risk bound holds for any finite sample size n and feature number p even if n≪ p without boundedness of features in contrast to the past work. Behavior of the regret bound is investigated by numerical simulations. We believe {{that this is the first}} extension of BC theory <b>to</b> general <b>supervised</b> learning with random design without approximation.

5|$|Due to the {{failures}} of the ratings agencies, European regulators obtained new powers <b>to</b> <b>supervise</b> ratings agencies. With the creation of the European Supervisory Authority in January 2011 the EU set up a whole range of new financial regulatory institutions, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which became the EU's single credit-ratings firm regulator. Credit-ratings companies have to comply with the new standards or will be denied operation on EU territory, says ESMA Chief Steven Maijoor.|$|E
5|$|During Hygeberht's archbishopric, joint synods for {{the provinces}} of Lichfield and Canterbury were held, presided over by both archbishops. These gatherings were canonically irregular, as the usual {{procedure}} was for each province to hold its own synod. The reasons for holding joint councils are unclear; {{they may have been}} a manifestation of Offa's desire <b>to</b> <b>supervise</b> the entire southern church, or an attempt by the archbishops of Canterbury to retain some authority over the province of Lichfield.|$|E
5|$|Excavations at {{the quarry}} were stopped in 1881, {{although}} it was not exhausted of fossils, as recent drilling operations have shown. During World War I, when the town was occupied by German forces, preparations were made to reopen the mine for palaeontology, and Otto Jaekel was sent from Berlin <b>to</b> <b>supervise.</b> The Allies recaptured Bernissart just as the first fossiliferous layer was about to be uncovered. Further attempts to reopen the mine were hindered by financial problems and were stopped altogether in 1921 when the mine flooded.|$|E

By November 1995, UNCRO had withdrawn to Sector East.
