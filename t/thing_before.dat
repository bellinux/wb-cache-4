[...] Believing that experienced players would require very little time to complete the game, GameSpot nevertheless considered New Super Mario Bros. a [...] "completely awesome" [...] game that was an [...] "absolutely necessary" [...] video game to own. GamesRadar considered the game a bargain, noting that it included [...] "a completely solid solo game, a simple-but-exciting two-player, and then a collection of super-quick stylus games".|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 985 feet long, {{was released}} on June 24, 1910. Advertisements played up {{the wreck of the}} $40,000 train car while a positive review in The Moving Picture World praised the well-managed production's prison and track wreck scenes, but remarked that the improbable story was purely fantastical. One of the more dramatic articles to appear in The Moving Picture World included reference to the film while playing up the dramatic element describe the footage and the filming of the wreck. It states: [...] "... The scenes were portrayals of a train crash and they give you startling before-and-after wreck views. They made you shiver when they showed you the fate that came to a car full of passengers - sudden, cruel and without warning. They made you shiver; ... And you thanked God that the <b>thing</b> <b>before</b> you was only a picture on the screen!" [...] Known advertisements for the film included theaters in Rhode Island and Indiana. Records show that film made it to Australia, with one Launceston, Tasmania newspaper showing an advertisement on January 30, 1911.|$|E

500|$|The United States Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, {{announced}} a formal {{interest in the}} Rhodesian situation in February 1976, and {{spent the rest of}} the year holding discussions with the British, South African and Frontline governments to produce a mutually satisfactory proposal. The plan that Kissinger eventually presented would give a transition period of two years before majority rule began, during which time an interim government would take control while a specially convened [...] "council of state", made up of three whites, three blacks and a white chairman, drew up a new constitution. This constitution would have to result in majority rule at the end of the two-year interim period. This plan was supported by Kenneth Kaunda and Julius Nyerere, the presidents of Zambia and Tanzania respectively, which South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster said guaranteed its acceptance by the black nationalists. Vorster had no reply when Smith ventured that he had said the same <b>thing</b> <b>before</b> the Victoria Falls talks in 1975, when Kaunda and Nyerere had agreed on no preconditions for talks, then allowed the nationalists to seek them.|$|E
500|$|Roddenberry said of Christianity, [...] "How can I {{take seriously}} a God-image that {{requires}} that I prostrate myself every seven days and praise it? That {{sounds to me}} like a very insecure personality." [...] At one point, he worked a similar opinion, which was to have been stated by a Vulcan, into the plot for Star Trek: The God <b>Thing.</b> <b>Before</b> his death, Roddenberry became close friends with philosopher Charles Musès, who said that Roddenberry's views were [...] "a far cry from atheism". Roddenberry explained his position thusly: [...] "It's not true that I don't believe in God. I believe in a kind of God. It's just not other people's God. I reject religion. I accept the notion of God." [...] He had an ongoing interest in other people's experiences with religion, and called Catholicism [...] "a very beautiful religion. An art form." [...] However, he said that he dismissed all organized religions, saying that for the most part, they acted like a [...] "substitute brain... and a very malfunctioning one". Roddenberry was also critical of how the public looked at certain religions, noting that when the King David Hotel bombing took place in 1946, the American public accepted it as the action of freedom fighters, whereas a car bombing by a Muslim in Beirut is condemned as a terrorist act. While he agreed that both parties were wrong in their use of violence, he said that the actions of both were undertaken because of their strong religious beliefs.|$|E
500|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{rebellion}} have {{been the source of}} much discussion and theories among modern scholars. Moving away from the personal relationship between al-Hajjaj and Ibn al-Ash'ath, Alfred von Kremer suggested that the rebellion was linked with the efforts of the non-Arab converts to Islam (the mawālī) to secure equal rights with the Arab Muslims. Julius Wellhausen rejected this view as the main source of the revolt, seeing it instead as a reaction of the Iraqis in general and the ashrāf in particular against the Syrian regime of the Umayyads as represented by the overbearing (and notably low-born) al-Hajjaj. Other scholars have seen in it a manifestation of the tribal factionalism between the northern Arab and southern Arab ("Yamani") tribal groups prevalent at the time. Thus a poem by a certain A'sha Hamdan in celebration of the rebellion shows not only a religious but also a tribal motivation of the rebel troops: al-Hajjaj is denounced as an apostate and a [...] "friend of the devil", while Ibn al-Ash'ath is portrayed as the champion of the Yamani Qahtani and Hamdani tribes against the northern Arab Ma'addis and Thaqafis. On the other hand, as G. R. Hawting points out, this is insufficient evidence to ascribe purely tribal motivations to the revolt: if Ibn al-Ash'ath's movement was indeed led largely by Yamanis, this simply reflects {{the fact that they were}} the dominant element in Kufa, and while al-Hajjaj himself was a northerner, his main commander was a southerner. Wellhausen's analysis, furthermore, ignored the evident religious dimension of the revolt, especially the participation of the fanatical zealots known as qurrāʾ ("Quran readers"). While the [...] "religious polemic used by both sides [...] is stereotyped, unspecific and to be found in other contexts", according to C. G. Hawting, there do appear to have been specific religious grievances, notably the accusation that the Umayyads were neglecting the ritual prayer. It seems [...] that the revolt began as a simple mutiny against an overbearing governor who made impossible demands of the troops, but, at least by the time the army reached Fars, a religious element had emerged, represented by the qurrāʾ. Given the close [...] "interaction of religion and politics in early Muslim society", as G. R. Hawting points out, the religious element quickly became dominant, as seen by the difference between the oath of allegiance (bayʿa) sworn at the beginning of the revolt and that exchanged between the army and Ibn al-Ash'ath at Istakhr in Fars. While in the first Ibn al-Ash'ath declared as his intention to [...] "depose al-Hajjaj, the enemy of God", in the latter, he exhorted his men to [...] " [...] the Book of God and the Sunna of His Prophet, to depose the imāms of error, to fight against those who regard [...] as licit". Although Ibn al-Ash'ath remained as the head of the uprising, Veccia Vaglieri writes that after this point [...] "one has the impression that [...] the control of the revolt slipped from his hands", or that, as Wellhausen comments, [...] "he was urged on in spite of himself, and even if he would, could not have banished the spirits which he had called up. It was as if an avalanche came rushing down sweeping every <b>thing</b> <b>before</b> it".|$|E
