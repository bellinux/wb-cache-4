2500|$|Infidelities at work {{or office}} romances are thought to stem at an individual's workplace. As {{the sheer number of}} women in the {{workforce}} is now matching the same numbers of men, researchers expect that as workplace interaction between the sexes increases, the likelihood of infidelity will also increase (Kuroki, 2010). [...] Wiggins and Lederer (1984) found that opportunities to engage in infidelity were related to the workplace where nearly one half of their samples who engaged in infidelity were involved with coworkers. A study done by McKinnish (2007) found that <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> a larger fraction of workers of the opposite sex {{are more likely to be}} divorced due to infidelity. Kuroki found married women were less likely to have a workplace affair whereas individuals who are self-employed are more likely to have had an extramarital affair. In 2000 Treas and Giesen found similar results where sexual opportunities in the workplace increased the likelihood of infidelity during the last 12 months.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{confirmed}} {{instance in}} which an animal fell ill with the disease occurred in 1986 in the United Kingdom, and lab tests the following year indicated the presence of BSE; by November 1987, the British Ministry of Agriculture accepted it had a new disease on its hands. Subsequently, 177 people (as of June 2014) contracted and died of a disease with similar neurological symptoms subsequently called (new) variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD). This is a separate disease from 'classical' Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, which {{is not related to}} BSE and has been known about since the early 1900s. Three cases of vCJD occurred in people who had lived in or visited the UK – one each in the Republic of Ireland, Canada, and the United States of America. Also, some concern existed about <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> (and therefore inhale) cattle meat and bone meal, such as horticulturists, who use it as fertilizer. Up-to-date statistics on all types of CJD are published by the National Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit [...] in Edinburgh, Scotland.|$|E
2500|$|In 1879, Dr. McCauley {{began an}} {{association}} between Dickinson College and the Carlisle Indian School that continued almost forty years. [...] The Indian School was less than {{two miles from the}} campus of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The long association began upon the opening of the Indian School at Carlisle Barracks when Dr. McCauley led the first worship service. It was Mrs. Pratt, wife of Superintendent Captain Richard Henry Pratt, who had initiated the contact between the Indian School and Dickinson. Upon Pratt's absence one Sunday, Mrs. Pratt wrote to President McCauley and requested his aid as a minister which he graciously accepted. The relationship did not stop there, with Captain Pratt noting that [...] "from that time forward Dr. McCauley became an advisor and most valued friend to the school" [...] and [...] "we had the advantage of contacting and contending with our distinguished neighbor, Dickinson College, with its more than a century of success in developing strong and eminent men to fill the highest places in our national life." [...] Thereafter, Dr. McCauley helped Pratt to develop a Board of Trustees and a Board of Visitors composed of different heads of leading national educational institutions and wealthy donors. The Indian school was only partly supported by government funds and was heavily dependent upon private philanthropy. Dickinson College professors served as chaplains and special faculty to the Indian School. Professor Charles Francis Himes, Dr. George Edward Reed, Stephen Baird and Joshua Lippincott fostered the relationship between the institutions through religious services, advisory meetings, lectures and commencement speeches. [...] The presence of Native Americans on campus generated great enthusiasm among Dickinson students, and they volunteered services, observed teaching methods and participated in events. The October 24, 1896 Dickinsonian [...] "On the Campus" [...] section tells of the new volunteer Sunday School teachers from the Dickinson chapter of the YMCA. It further declares that <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> Indian boys [...] "enjoy a rare privilege." [...] In addition, at the time of annual Indian School commencement, it was traditional for a half day holiday to be given so Dickinson students could attend the [...] "very interesting exercises." [...] Dickinson College also provided Carlisle Indian School students with access to the Dickinson Preparatory School ("Conway Hall") and college level education.|$|E

60|$|Rest is sweet, as {{well for}} the body as for the mind. During my long experience, amid the vicissitudes of a {{chequered}} life, I have found that periods of profound rest at certain intervals, {{in addition to the}} ordinary hours of repose, are necessary to the well-being of man. And the nature, as well as the period, of this rest varies according to the different temperaments of individuals and the peculiar circumstances in which they may chance to be placed. To <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> their minds, bodily labour is rest; to those who labour with the body, deep sleep is rest; to the downcast, the weary, and the sorrowful, joy and peace are rest. Nay, further, I think that to the gay, the frivolous, the reckless, when sated with pleasures that cannot last, even sorrow proves to be rest of a kind, although, perchance, it were better that I should call it relief than rest. There is, indeed, but one class of men to whom rest is denied--there is no rest to the wicked. At this I do but hint, however, as I treat not of that rest which is spiritual, but more particularly of that which applies to the mind and to the body.|$|E
