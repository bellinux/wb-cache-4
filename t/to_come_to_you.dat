5|$|The reason I haven't {{spoken to}} you before now is this: You deserve the truth. And as {{frustrating}} as the waiting has been, I felt it was improper <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> with sketchy reports, or possibly even erroneous statements, which would then have to be corrected, creating even more doubt and confusion. There's been enough of that.|$|E
2500|$|Bukowski died {{of leukemia}} on March 9, 1994, in San Pedro, aged 73, shortly after {{completing}} his last novel, Pulp. The funeral rites, orchestrated by his widow, {{were conducted by}} Buddhist monks. He is interred at Green Hills Memorial Park in Rancho Palos Verdes. An account of the proceedings {{can be found in}} Gerald Locklin's book Charles Bukowski: A Sure Bet. His gravestone reads: [...] "Don't Try", a phrase which Bukowski uses in one of his poems, advising aspiring writers and poets about inspiration and creativity. Bukowski explained the phrase in a 1963 letter to John William Corrington: [...] "Somebody at one of these places [...] asked me: 'What do you do? How do you write, create?' You don't, I told them. You don't try. That's very important: not to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality. You wait, and if nothing happens, you wait some more. It's like a bug high on the wall. You wait for it <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> When it gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. Or if you like its looks you make a pet out of it." [...] Bukowski was an atheist.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Ah! when I set out <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee,</b> I was {{a walking}} rainbow; yet I was coxcomb {{enough to think}} thou wouldst {{overlook}} it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me," [...] she said, in her gentle voice, [...] "in that I dare <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> in Cleopatra's place. Thy joy is not {{delayed for}} long, for thou shalt see her presently." ...|$|R
60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. I {{was bored}} to death. Never opened my lips the whole time. Absolutely longing <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in <b>to</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{could see}} last night how unhappy they both were. And when Cynthia {{suggested}} it, I agreed at once <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{and tell you}} everything.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and that}} gave me courage <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> even after {{the way in which}} we parted this morning. I knew you would not {{misunderstand}} me"-- ...|$|E
60|$|Will {{you give}} my small Admiral, on his {{personal}} application, one sovereign? I have told him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> for that recognition of his meritorious services.|$|E
5000|$|<b>To</b> <b>come,</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>you</b> tell me, but I cannot {{go there}} easily. Sado is {{away from here}} 49 ri, over the sea waves.|$|R
60|$|LARRY. May I ask {{how long}} it took <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> business? <b>You</b> can hardly have known her for {{more than a couple of}} hours.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is true that}} I am {{to marry}} Alison," [...] Holder answered, [...] "and that I intended, later on, <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> inform <b>you</b> of the fact." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dick,' {{she said}} quietly, 'suppose I were <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> now,--be quiet a minute,--just as I am, {{and caring for}} you {{just as much as}} I do.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A good many. I don't know. I am {{horrified to}} look back on it, and the least I can do after it is <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> like this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought of}} writing to you, Mr. Hodder. My mother, I believe, has done so. But {{it seemed to}} me, on second thought, better <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> direct." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} forgive my {{remarking}} it," [...] Mr. Pengarth said, [...] "this seems rather an extraordinary place for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> if <b>you</b> really dislike solitude." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That" [...] Speedwell answered, [...] "is our business. <b>You</b> didn't <b>come</b> <b>to</b> us--I <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> All <b>you</b> have <b>to</b> do is {{to answer}} a few questions, and let me have that photo." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't {{expect me}} to-night. I will send Fanny to ask {{one of the}} Wellands <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and {{telegraph}} if I bring any one home with me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dick," [...] {{she said}} quietly, [...] "suppose I were <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> now,--be quiet a minute,--just as I am, {{and caring for}} you {{just as much as}} I do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know; but it's so. I {{got some}} of their jabber out of a book. S'pose a man was <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and say Polly-voo-franzy--what would you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The adventures I do not doubt, Annabel," [...] she said. [...] "They seem <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> as {{naturally}} as disappointment--to other people. But to England! What has happened, then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir; she {{and all of}} us owe {{her life}} to him. Feyther wanted <b>to</b> <b>come</b> down <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> but I said better not yet awhile, you would understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|But now, when Shall-come, the {{absolute}} promise of God, <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> be fulfilled upon them, then they come; because by that promise a cure is provided against the rebellion of their will. [...] "Thy people shall be willing {{in the day}} of thy power"(Psa 110:3). Thy people, what people? Why, the people that thy Father hath given thee. The obstinacy and plague {{that is in the}} will of that people, shall be taken away; and they shall be made willing; Shall-come will make them willing <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "If anybody were <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Lady Fawn, {{and make}} horrible accusations against Lord Fawn, or against Augusta, would not you be angry? Would {{you be able}} to stand it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{immediately}} {{perceived that}} it was my duty to come to you; <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and tell you that another lady has a prior claim upon Mr Maguire's hand and heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have doubtless {{received}} my letter," [...] began Mr. Worthington. [...] "I only arrived in Brampton an hour ago, but I {{thought it best}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> at once, under the circumstances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--I've come at last. It {{would not}} have done for me <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up <b>to</b> <b>you</b> when you were in bed. Those women down-stairs would have talked about it everywhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Peter, [...] "but {{there are}} {{lots and lots of}} things I would like to know about other people. If you please, I would like <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> school <b>to</b> <b>you</b> every day. You see, the more I learn about my neighbors, the better able I will be to take care of myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't know. We {{heard you}} were ill and mother wanted <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> see <b>you.</b> Father wouldn't let her. He {{thought it might be}} measles and he is afraid of {{catching}} things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{beginning}} to be thin enough at the top. I am so glad <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and so much obliged to you for having me! How well I remember the old room!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, {{by virtue}} of my rights and authority, I will take her by force, Christopher Harflete, and if harm should happen <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> now or hereafter, on your own head be it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand, sir," [...] said he, [...] "that {{you asked}} for my wife, but I thought it better <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> myself. What is your {{business}} with her, sir, {{and what is your}} name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's he," [...] {{said the}} lady. [...] "If {{you will go}} and find out where he is, and ask him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> me, <b>you</b> will do {{me a great deal}} of good." ...|$|R
6000|$|He tried boyishly to dignify the {{situation}} when {{he lifted his}} face, and he said, [...] "I didn't mean <b>to</b> <b>come</b> boohooing <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in this way, and I'm ashamed of myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Master Bridgenorth," [...] {{said the}} Lady Peveril gaily, [...] "those evil omenings do but point out conclusions, which, {{unless they were}} so anticipated, are most {{unlikely}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> pass. <b>You</b> know what Shakespeare says-- ...|$|R
