40|$|Abstract. We propose {{so called}} clausal tableau systems for <b>the</b> common modal <b>logics</b> K, KD, T, KB, KDB and B.

Basing on these systems, we give a {{decision}} procedure for <b>the</b> <b>logics,</b> which uses O(n 2) -space for <b>the</b> <b>logics</b> T, KB, KDB and B, and O(n. log n) -space for <b>the</b> <b>logics</b> K and KD.

5|$|Controversy rapidly {{surrounded}} Edward's death. With Mortimer's {{execution in}} 1330, rumours began to circulate that Edward {{had been murdered}} at Berkeley Castle. Accounts {{that he had been}} killed by the insertion of a red-hot iron or poker into his anus slowly began to circulate, possibly as a result of deliberate propaganda; chroniclers in the mid-1330s and 1340s spread this account further, supported in later years by Geoffrey le Baker's colourful account of the killing. It became incorporated into most later histories of Edward, typically being linked to his possible homosexuality. Most historians now dismiss this account of Edward's death, querying <b>the</b> <b>logic</b> in Edward's captors murdering him in such an easily detectable fashion.|$|E
5|$|Dalton applied <b>the</b> <b>logic</b> of abolitionism to {{the cause}} of women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E

30|$|We use the {{framework}} of institutional logics (Friedland and Alford 1991; Thornton et al. 2012) to analyse how the norms and values built into <b>the</b> <b>logics</b> of excellence and innovation influence individual researchers affiliated with these two different centres. <b>The</b> <b>logics</b> of excellence and innovation may sometimes be in conflict but also overlap depending on their degree of compatibility and centrality in each specific situation (Besharov and Smith 2014), resulting in different degrees of synergy, negotiations and tensions. This offers an opportunity to study temporary research centres as agents of change: how researchers relate to and identify with <b>the</b> <b>logics</b> associated with <b>the</b> centres (Meyer and Hammerschmid 2006), also {{in order to better}} understand <b>the</b> <b>logics</b> associated with triple helix relations.|$|R
30|$|Both logics {{were present}} in both centre types, but with some {{variation}} depending on the perceived compatibility and centrality of <b>the</b> <b>logics.</b> All <b>the</b> informants in the CoE in natural science made statements that showed {{a high degree of}} compatibility between <b>the</b> <b>logics,</b> but <b>the</b> centrality of <b>the</b> <b>logics</b> was low (only one needed to reach the centre goal). The researchers exposed a rather tension-free attitude compared to their colleagues from social sciences who largely made statements that excellence and innovation are/should be separate (low compatibility), even though they themselves collaborated with public agencies. In <b>the</b> CoERIs, both <b>logics</b> were central, but we also observed different identifications with <b>the</b> <b>logics.</b> In centres where the compatibility was contested, there were tensions, while in centres where the compatibility was perceived as high, the researchers identified with both logics.|$|R
5|$|Eventually, {{tensions}} faded, but {{a bigger}} decision awaited Robert Breckinridge in 1828. He {{was chosen to}} sit on a committee that would draft Kentucky's response to the Nullification Crisis. Because much of South Carolina's reasoning for their actions was based on <b>the</b> <b>logic</b> of the Kentucky Resolutions, which had been supported by Senator John Breckinridge, Robert Breckinridge now had to determine whether he should support the words of his late father or refute them. In the end, his Unionist sympathies overrode his sense of loyalty to his father; he sided with the committee's majority in condemning South Carolina's actions.|$|E
5|$|In Greek mythology, Serpens {{represents}} a snake {{held by the}} healer Asclepius. Represented in the sky by the constellation Ophiuchus, Asclepius once killed a snake, but the animal was subsequently resurrected after a second snake placed a revival herb on it before its death. As snakes shed their skin every year, they were known as the symbol of rebirth in ancient Greek society, and legend says Asclepius would revive dead humans using the same technique he witnessed. Although this is likely <b>the</b> <b>logic</b> for Serpens' presence with Ophiuchus, the true reason is still not fully known.

5|$|Qiyas or analogical {{reason is}} the fourth source of the sharia for the {{majority}} of Sunni jurisprudence. It aims to draw analogies to a previously accepted decision. Shiites do not accept analogy, but replace it with reason (aql); among Sunnis, the Hanbalites have traditionally been reluctant to accept analogy while the Zahirites don't accept it at all. Analogical reason in Islam is the process of legal deduction according to which the jurist, confronted with an unprecedented case, bases his or her argument on <b>the</b> <b>logic</b> used in the Qur'an and Sunnah.

5|$|Several {{journalists and}} conservationists have {{challenged}} <b>the</b> <b>logic</b> of the strategy, arguing that destroying the ivory makes it scarcer, which should drive up black market prices {{and lead to}} an increase in poaching, rather than a decrease. Karl Mathiesen disputes this claim from a basic economics perspective, pointing out that it is the seizure of the ivory, not destroying it, which takes it off the market and affects its scarcity, so the price should not be significantly affected based on whether that seized ivory is kept stockpiled in a warehouse or destroyed. Although destroying seized ivory should not affect a perfectly rational market, Daniel Stiles suggests that what these events effectively communicate to poachers and illegal traders is the perception of scarcity, if not actual scarcity, which he argues could also {{lead to an increase}} in poaching.|$|E

This redesign, and the absence of expansion slots, kept manufacturing costs low. This lack of expansion abilities, along with the small screen size and Macintosh's popularity in the burgeoning field of desktop publishing led to such oddities as video displays that connected through the SCSI port by users seeking to connect a larger full- or dual-page display to their Mac. The Classic design was used once more in 1991 for the Classic II, which succeeded the Classic and replaced the Macintosh SE/30.|$|E

5|$|The twentieth-century philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr {{attempted}} to reinterpret the Augustinian theodicy {{in the light}} of evolutionary science by presenting its underlying argument without mythology. Niebuhr proposed that Augustine rejected the Manichean view that grants evil ontological existence and ties humans' sin to their created state. Augustine's argument continued, according to Niebuhr, by proposing that humans have a tendency to sin because of a biologically inherited nature and rejected the Pelagian view that human will could overcome sin on its own. Niebuhr believed Augustine's argument placed sin in the human will, which was corrupted by Adam's original sin. He argued that <b>the</b> <b>logic</b> behind Augustine's theodicy described sin as inevitable but unnecessary, which he believed captured the argument without relying on a literal interpretation of the fall, thus avoiding critique from scientific positions.|$|E
