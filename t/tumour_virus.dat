40|$|AbstractThe {{study of}} small DNA <b>tumour</b> <b>viruses</b> like SV 40 and polyoma {{was one of}} the major entry points for the study of eukaryotes.

40|$|Import of viral DNA {{into the}} nucleus is {{essential}} for the successful replication of DNA <b>tumour</b> <b>viruses.</b> To achieve this goal, viruses have adapted strategies to traverse the barriers between the plasma membrane and the nucleus of a host cell. Two DNA <b>tumour</b> <b>viruses,</b> simian virus 40 and adenovirus, achieve the nuclear-entry step in slightly different ways. SV 40 DNA enters the nucleus through the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) in apparently intact virions. By contrast, adenovirus particles dissociate near the NPC before the viral DNA is imported into the nucleus. In both cases, karyophilic protein components of the viruses appear to mediate nuclear entry of the viral genomes.

We have investigated the mechanism of activation in SV 40 -transformed cells and we find that the effect is due to an increase in the activity of the general class III transcription factor TFIIIC, achieved both by an increase in factor abundance and by a change in its phosphorylation state. SV 40 transformation also stimulates transcription of other genes by RNA polymerase III but the effect may be balanced by compensatory post-transcriptional changes. TFIIIC may mediate the stimulation of polymerase III transcription by a range of transforming viruses...|$|R

40|$|With between 10 % and 15 % {{of human}} cancers {{attributable}} to viral infection, {{there is great}} interest, from both a scientific and clinical viewpoint, as to how these pathogens modulate host cell functions. Seven human <b>tumour</b> <b>viruses</b> {{have been identified as}} being involved in the development of specific malignancies. It has long been known that the introduction of chromosomal aberrations is a common feature of viral infections. Intensive research {{over the past two decades}} has subsequently revealed that viruses specifically interact with cellular mechanisms responsible for the recognition and repair of DNA lesions, collectively known as the DNA damage response (DDR). These interactions can involve activation and deactivation of individual DDR pathways as well as the recruitment of specific proteins to sites of viral replication. Since the DDR has evolved to protect the genome from the accumulation of deleterious mutations, deregulation is inevitably associated with an increased risk of tumour formation. This review summarises the current literature regarding the complex relationship between known human <b>tumour</b> <b>viruses</b> and the DDR and aims to shed light on how these interactions can contribute to genomic instability and ultimately the development of human cancers...|$|R

50|$|Phytoreoviruses {{are unique}} among Reoviridae {{in that there}} are 12 dsRNA {{segments}} in each virus. Like all other Reoviridae, they contain their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, allowing for endogenous synthesis of viral mRNA within the virus. Although less well studied than orthoreovirus and orbivirus, considerable structural and biochemical studies have been undertaken to characterize phytoreoviruses, which in general infect plants. There are three recognized phytoreoviruses: wound <b>tumour</b> <b>virus</b> (WTV), rice dwarf virus (RDV) and rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV). Possible additional family members include tobacco leaf enation virus (TLEF), rice bunchy stunt virus and sweet potato virus (ICTV, VIDE). There are also several RDV isolates, all of which share over 90% sequence identity. Of these phytoreoviruses, RDV has been extensively studied and is the best characterized member.

40|$|Persistent {{infection}} with cancer risk-related viruses leads to molecular, cellular and immune response changes in host organisms {{that in some}} cases direct cellular transformation. Alternative splicing is a conserved cellular process that increases the coding complexity of genomes at the pre-mRNA processing stage. Human and other animal <b>tumour</b> <b>viruses</b> use alternative splicing as a process to maximize their transcriptomes and proteomes. Medical therapeutics to clear persistent viral infections are still limited. However, specific lessons learned in some viruses (e. g. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV)) suggest that drug-directed inhibition of alternative splicing could be useful for this purpose. This review describes the basic mechanisms of constitutive and alternative splicing in a cellular context and known splicing patterns and the mechanisms by which these might be achieved for the major human-infective <b>tumour</b> <b>viruses.</b> The roles of splicing-related proteins expressed by these viruses in cellular and viral gene regulation are explored. Moreover, we discuss some currently available drugs targeting serine-arginine-rich SR proteins that are the main regulators of constitutive and alternative splicing, and their potential use in treatment for so-called persistent viral infections...|$|R

40|$|Retroviral {{integrase}} catalyses {{the integration}} of viral DNA into host target DNA, which is an essential step in {{the life cycle of}} all retroviruses 1. Previous structural characterization of integrase???viral DNA complexes, or intasomes, from the spumavirus prototype foamy virus revealed a functional integrase tetramer 2, 3, 4, 5, and it is generally believed that intasomes derived from other retroviral genera use tetrameric integrase 6, 7, 8, 9. However, the intasomes of orthoretroviruses, which include all known pathogenic species, have not been characterized structurally. Here, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, we determine an unexpected octameric integrase architecture for the intasome of the betaretrovirus mouse mammary <b>tumour</b> <b>virus.</b> The structure is composed of two core integrase dimers, which interact with the viral DNA ends and structurally mimic the integrase tetramer of prototype foamy virus, and two flanking integrase dimers that engage the core structure via their integrase carboxy-terminal domains. Contrary to the belief that tetrameric integrase components are sufficient to catalyse integration, the flanking integrase dimers were necessary for mouse mammary <b>tumour</b> <b>virus</b> integrase activity. The integrase octamer solves a conundrum for betaretroviruses as well as alpharetroviruses by providing critical carboxy-terminal domains to the intasome core that cannot be provided in cis because of evolutionarily restrictive catalytic core domain???carboxy-terminal domain linker regions. The octameric architecture of the intasome of mouse mammary <b>tumour</b> <b>virus</b> provides new insight into the structural basis of retroviral DNA integration...|$|E

40|$|Small DNA <b>tumour</b> <b>viruses</b> produce {{proteins}} that redirect cellular gene expression and growth control. The E 1 A polypeptides of adenovirus perform {{the functions of}} transcriptional activation and cellular transformation. These two functions are carried out by different domains within the E 1 A protein. The E 1 A protein associates with several cellular proteins, including {{the product of the}} retinoblastoma gene, pRb- 1. Mutational analysis correlates transformation with the sites required for binding pRb and two other cellular proteins, p 107 and a 300 kDa polypeptide. This correlation suggests that these proteins are targets for E 1 A-mediated transformation. Transforming proteins from other small DNA <b>tumour</b> <b>viruses</b> interact with pRb, raising the possibility that a common event in viral transformation is the inactivation of {{proteins that}} inhibit cellular proliferation. The role of the E 1 A-associated 60 kDa protein, p 60, in transformation is being investigated. In the absence of E 1 A, p 60 binds to the human homologue of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc 2 gene product, p 34, to form a complex that has kinase activity that oscillates during the cell cycle. Ongoing studies of the effect of adenovirus infection, and specifically E 1 A expression, on this cellular kinase may provide clues to how E 1 A overcomes cell cycle controls and transforms cells...|$|R
