500|$|The {{day before}} the All-Star Game, Giants' manager and 2011 NL All-Star Manager, Bruce Bochy, {{announced}} his decision to bat Kemp third in the line up. Explaining his decision, Bochy said about Kemp, [...] "He's a guy with speed, power, a guy that can beat you with a base hit or a long ball. He's {{what you call a}} complete player – tremendous defender, but more so in the 3-hole, he can do so many <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> He's so dangerous." [...] Kemp, with a single and a walk, became the first Dodger to reach base twice in an All-Star Game since Mike Piazza in 1996.|$|E
