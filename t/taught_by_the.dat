This is considered an exemplary interaction between Daoist master and disciple, reflecting the testing a seeker must undergo before being accepted.

5|$|Astronomy {{classes at}} the University of Illinois date to its {{earliest}} days. The first courses focused on measurement {{of the night sky}} and was taken by civil engineering students to sharpen their surveying skills. A small observatory consisting of a 4-inch refractor and a small transit telescope was constructed by 1872. The astronomy courses were typically <b>taught</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mathematics department and by the early 1890s, several mathematics instructors wanted to do more with astronomy. An expanded astronomy curriculum would require a new larger facility. The Illinois state legislature voted in 1895 to fund a new teaching observatory at the University of Illinois, providing $15,000 for construction. The site chosen was a grass knoll between Matthews Avenue and Burrill Avenue, just north of the Morrow Plots, a National Historic Landmark that is the nation's oldest experimental field. Contracts were extended to Charles A. Gunn, the architect and an instructor on campus, and Bevis and Company in Urbana as the general contractor with construction beginning in April 1896. The building was completed by August at a total cost of $6,800. The principle telescope was installed in November and the final telescope was in place by February 1897.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, Johns became commandant of the Engineer School at Fort Belvoir. The wartime Engineer School was {{responsible}} for the training of officers. Some were engineers in civilian life who were trained as officers; other were officers transferred from other arms who were given training in engineering subjects. The Officer Candidate School (OCS) prepared enlisted men for commissioning as officers. There had been strong criticism of the content of training courses from SWPA, where it was the norm for machinery to be operated around the clock and for engineer officers to supervise all manner of construction tasks. The commanders there felt that the training courses <b>taught</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Engineer School were concentrating too much on leadership in combat, and not enough on technical matters, such the operation and maintenance of construction equipment. Johns reformed the curriculum, but by this time {{it was too late for}} the changes to have much effect in the overseas theaters of operations.

This study was {{conducted}} in the Fifth Semester of English Department of the Faculty of Teacher Training and Education of Mahasaraswati University in Denpasar with the subjects was the Fifth Semester Students of the Academic Year 2011 / 2012. The population of this study was 11 classes consisted of 300 students who took writing IV course. From all populations, 60 students were used as sample which were divided into two groups, i. e. experimental group and control group and recruited by using Cluster Random Sampling Technique. The experimental group was semester VC (30 students) and were treated by using Theme and Rheme technique and the control group was semester VD (30 students) and were treated by using Conventional technique. The research design was Posttest Only Control Group Design by using 2 x 2 factorial design. There were three variables in this study, namely: independent, moderator, and dependent variables. The independent variable was Theme and Rheme technique and moderator variable was students 2 ̆ 7 achievement motivation level (high and low), and the dependent variable was students 2 ̆ 7 writing competency in writing paragraph (short story, personal letter, and business letter). The research used two data-collection instruments, i. e. the writing competency test and the scale of achievement motivation in studying English as foreign language. The data were analyzed by using descriptive statistic and inferential statistic i. e. two-way ANOVA and then continued by using Tukey test. The results of the finding were: (1) there was a significant difference in writing competency between the students who are <b>taught</b> <b>by</b> using Theme and Rheme technique and those who are <b>taught</b> <b>by</b> using Conventional technique.
