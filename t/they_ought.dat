5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to be starved. They are slaves; therefore <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to be beaten. They work hard; therefore <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E
5|$|Some municipalities, {{particularly}} in South Jersey, are dry towns where no alcohol can be legally served or sold. Some {{of them are}} dry because of their origins as Quaker, Methodist, or other Protestant religious communities. For example, the seaside resort town of Ocean City has been dry since {{it was founded in}} 1879 by four Methodist clergymen. In recent years, several municipalities have questioned whether <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to remain dry. Dry towns frequently have public referendums on whether they should remain dry or allow liquor sales in order to attract new businesses and increase property tax revenue.|$|E
40|$|Individuals have {{various kinds}} of obligations: keep promises, don’t cause harm, return {{benefits}} received from injustices, be partial to loved ones, help the needy and so on. How does this work for group agents? There are two questions here. The first is whether groups can bear {{the same kinds of}} obligations as individuals. The second is whether groups’ pro tanto obligations plug into what <b>they</b> all-things-considered <b>ought</b> to do to the same degree that individuals’ pro tanto obligations plug into what <b>they</b> all-things-considered <b>ought</b> to do. We argue for parity on both count...|$|R

5|$|A {{public enquiry}} {{was held in}} 1873, to {{determine}} whether it would be advantageous for the city to be administered by a municipal corporation. The result being in the affirmative, the city council, sometimes archaically called the corporation, was founded by a Charter of Incorporation dated 17 March 1874, under the government of a mayor, six aldermen and 18 councillors. Something of an anomaly, the Parliamentary Boundary Commission of 1868 had decided that the urban parts of Fletton and Woodston were so involved in Peterborough that <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to be in the borough and added the newly built-up portions of these parishes to the parliamentary constituency. In local matters they were still in Huntingdonshire and, as the City of Peterborough did not extend south of the River Nene, the full title of the new municipality was the City and Borough of Peterborough and its inhabitants, citizens and burgesses.|$|E
5|$|Adam and Rachel (James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale), and Karen and David (Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst) {{arrive in}} Sydney, Australia for Pete and Jo's (John Thomson and Kimberley Joseph) hastily {{arranged}} wedding. Jo's father Rod Ellison (Gary Sweet) is {{surprised to learn}} that his daughter is getting married to a man he suspects is only after his money. After speaking to Rod, Adam tells Pete that he thinks the wedding is going ahead for the wrong reasons. Pete reacts angrily and tells Adam to forget being his best man. The following morning, Rod tries to bribe Pete to call off the wedding, but Pete declines. He later overhears Rod forbidding Jo to marry him and tells her <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to postpone the wedding. Jo is devastated at his decision, and tells him to get out of her house. She confides her sorrow in her ex-fiancé Shawn (Sandy Winton), who unsuccessfully tries to restart their relationship by proposing to her.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most of {{the other}} ironclads of the Ottoman fleet, the four Osmaniye-class ships were kept out of action during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, since they were among the largest and most {{powerful}} vessels of the fleet and the high command decided <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to be preserved. As a result, they generally remained safely in the Sea of Marmara, though Osmaniye was briefly used as a troop transport in the Mediterranean Sea. The four ships were reduced to reserve status in Constantinople after the war, {{with the rest of the}} Ottoman fleet. The four ships were heavily rebuilt in the early 1890s, being converted into more modern barbette ships. Nevertheless, they were in poor condition by the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, with many of their guns damaged or incomplete. Training exercises conducted in May highlighted the very low standard of training of their crews, and reinforced the decision not to confront the Greek Navy at sea.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{interested}} in exploring adolescent sexuality using this perspective typically investigates how gender, race, culture, socioeconomic status {{and sexual orientation}} affect how adolescent understand their own sexuality.

Because they are girls, they believe <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to engage in sexual behavior in order to please their boyfriends.|$|E

According to a second account, on 1 January he insisted on marching his battalion into Princeton. Major Weltner argued strongly against this, and when the colonel and 10 men continued into the town, they were made prisoners. While he was in New York City, other prisoners including Ethan Allen and Alexander Graydon reported that Haussegger told them that the American cause was finished. He suggested to the others that <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to ask forgiveness and make peace with the British. Haussegger bragged that he dined with Hessian General Leopold Philip von Heister.|$|E

25|$|There {{were many}} herds and flocks. The flocks were {{committed}} to a shepherd, who gave receipt for them and took them out to pasture. The Code fixed his wage. He was responsible for all care, must restore ox for ox, sheep for sheep and must breed them satisfactorily. Any dishonest use of the flock had to be repaid tenfold, but loss due to disease or wild beasts fell upon the owner. The shepherd made good all loss due to his own neglect. If he let the flock feed on a field of crops, he had to pay damages fourfold; if he turned them into standing crops when <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to have been folded, he paid twelvefold.|$|E
25|$|Reception to Wenjack {{was later}} {{overshadowed by the}} controversies around Boyden's {{genealogy}} and tribal affiliations. Debbie Reese, an Indigenous author and researcher of Native American portrayal in children’s literature, had an overall negative perception of Boyden’s novella. In a series of tweets {{a few months after}} the release of Wenjack, she criticizes Boyden’s act as just one of many that “ Native ancestry … the centerpiece of who they are”, and the belief that “they can speak/write of things <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> not.” Pieta Woolley, in an article titled “Cultural thieves” for the United Church Observer, mentioned Wenjack as an introduction to labelling Boyden as “the latest alleged offender” in the midst of social questions regarding cultural thievery.|$|E
25|$|Simmias confesses that he {{does not}} wish to disturb Socrates during his final hours by unsettling his belief in the {{immortality}} of the soul, and those present are reluctant to voice their skepticism. Socrates grows aware of their doubt and assures his interlocutors {{that he does}} indeed believe in the soul's immortality, {{regardless of whether or not}} he has succeeded in showing it as yet. For this reason, he is not upset facing death and assures them that <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> to express their concerns regarding the arguments. Simmias then presents his case that the soul resembles the harmony of the lyre. It may be, then, that as the soul resembles the harmony in its being invisible and divine, once the lyre has been destroyed, the harmony too vanishes, therefore when the body dies, the soul too vanishes. Once the harmony is dissipated, we may infer that so too will the soul dissipate once the body has been broken, through death.|$|E
