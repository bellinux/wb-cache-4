5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> was a {{specific}} {{piece of the}} Inner Border that became the physical embodiment of the Iron Curtain that stood between East Germany and West Germany in the decades following the conclusion of World War II. <b>The</b> <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> stretched approximately 28 miles (45km) through the city of Berlin and another 75 miles (120km) {{around the edges of}} West Berlin and stood close to 15 feet (5 meters) in height. The sheer physical stature of <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> in addition to becoming an iconic, international symbol of the Cold War and its virtues, drove it to become a popular site of tourism throughout its existence, and even after its dismantling. Tourism of <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> reached its height in 1961, although an exact number cannot be given for the number of visitors to <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall,</b> as there were no official records of tourism to the site made at the time. Estimates, however, are provided through the counting of tourists by Western and Eastern border guards. The numbers obtained from the border guards suggest that Berlin Wall tourism was a popular outing for German people and foreigners alike, it is reported that <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> received approximately 1.65 million tourists in 1969 alone, with around 23,000 of those being foreign visitors. Day trips were the most popular of the ways to visit <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall,</b> which could be conducted even through organized tours that were governmentally funded, so long as they were presented as educational in nature.|$|E

5|$|After the {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> in August 1961, the Seventh Army began sending infantry units from the divisions in West Germany on a rotating basis to reinforce the Berlin Brigade. The 24th Division's units participated in this action.|$|E
5|$|Between 1950 and 1988, around 4 million East Germans {{migrated}} to the West; 3.454million left between 1950 {{and the construction of}} <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> in 1961. After the border was fortified and <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> constructed, the number of illegal crossings fell dramatically and continued to fall as the defences were improved over the subsequent decades. However, escapees were never more than a small minority {{of the total number of}} emigrants from East Germany. During the 1980s, only about 1% of those who left East Germany did so by escaping across the border. Far more people left the country after being granted official permits, by fleeing through third countries or by being ransomed by the West German government.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{general purpose}} of this study is to look at what four {{different}} Swedish newspapers reported about <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> <b>walls</b> fall. <b>The</b> newspapers chosen for the study are Ny Dag, Arbetet, Svenska Dagbladet and Dagens Nyheter. The method used is a qualitative method while analyzing newspaper materials. This is accomplished by using four different questions. What was the reaction? What was the predicted future? How the magazines opinion is shown through their general ideological believes? Was <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> <b>walls</b> fall viewed as a threat? The general reaction was a euphoric feeling and a new time for Europe. The future talks centered on the uniting of the two Germanys and why this should or shouldn’t happen. The political messages were different in every newspaper. Svenska Dagbladet went hard against communism while Ny Dag defended it. Arbetets reporting was milder and Dagens Nyheter tried to play both sides. The newspapers did report about a threat perspective and it was about the relationship between superpowers and the impending question about immigrants from DDR. The threat perspective was lowering while a peace perspective was rising...|$|R

5|$|As {{the press}} conference had been {{broadcast}} live, within hours, thousands of people gathered at <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> demanding that the guards open the gates. The border guards were unable to contact their superiors for instructions and, fearing a stampede, opened the gates. The iconic scenes that followed– people pouring into West Berlin, standing on the Wall and attacking it with pickaxes– were broadcast worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Former {{students}} from Prague, including Constantine Menges, and Czech {{refugees from the}} crisis, {{who were able to}} escape or resettle in Western Countries continued to advocate for human rights, religious liberty, freedom of speech and political asylum for Czech political prisoners and dissidents. Many raised concerns about the Soviet Union and Red Army's continued military occupation of the Czechoslovakia in the 1970s and 1980s, prior to the fall of <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> and collapse of Communism in Moscow and Eastern Europe.|$|E
50|$|Later on, after <b>the</b> fall of <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall,</b> <b>the</b> {{line has}} been re-connected to Potsdam again. Reconstruction began in April 1991 and was {{completed}} in 1 April 1992. Between <b>the</b> fall of <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> and 1 April 1992, Potsdam was connected through the fastest way via Griebnitzsee to interchange at Wannsee, besides transit traffic. S1 was temporarily extended from Wannsee to Potsdam Stadt from 2003 to 2006.|$|R

5|$|The fall of <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> and German reunification {{made for}} a sudden spike of {{importance}} for the Stadtbahn. The first InterRegio train ran to Cologne in 1990. Since 1991, Intercity trains to Karlsruhe, Cologne and Hamburg used the Stadtbahn. The Hamburg line was soon extended to Dresden and Prague, and the former Interzonenzug trains from Munich were converted to InterCity trains and now ran on the Stadtbahn as well.|$|E
5|$|The use of lethal {{force on}} <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> <b>Wall</b> was an {{integral}} part of the East German state's policy towards its border system. Nonetheless, the East German government was well aware that border killings had undesirable consequences. The West German, US, British and French authorities protested killings when they occurred and the international reputation of East Germany was damaged as a result. It also undermined the East German government's support at home.|$|E
