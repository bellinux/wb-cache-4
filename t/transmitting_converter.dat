30|$|The AC/DC/AC {{converters}} {{equipped with}} bidirectional IGBTs are connected between rotor windings and grid bus. The power that <b>transmitted</b> via <b>converters</b> is typically about 25 – 30 % of generator nominal power [4]. The rotor side converter (RSC) and grid side converter (GSC) are voltage sourced converters that use forced commutated power electronic components to synthesize AC voltage from DC voltage source. The shunt capacitor that connected to DC side {{works as a}} DC voltage source. The controllers of converters are divided into two main parts such as RSC controller and GSC controller, where the RSC is used to control active power and reactive power (or voltage level), while the GSC is used to control DC-link voltage and reactive power.|$|R

Abstract — Data converters, in particular the <b>transmit</b> digitalto-analog <b>converter</b> (DAC), should not limit performance in a digital-communication transceiver. Typically, the number of DAC bits is chosen to be large enough so that the effect of DAC quantization noise on the local receiver is negligibly small. As described in this paper, the DAC quantization noise can be cancelled in a echo-canceling full-duplex transceiver. The proposed quantization-noise cancellation allows use of a simpler, lower resolution DAC. The quantization-noise cancellation concept is described, and simulation results are presented that demonstrate its operation...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{power line}} {{communication}} (PLC) in digitally controlled high-frequency switched-mode power supplies in distributed architectures that share the same bus voltage. Communication between different dc–dc converters is obtained by using switching frequency modulation and by detecting the switching signal on the common supply bus voltage. In case of low power transmission, a small duty-cycle perturbation at half of switching frequency is added to enhance {{the energy of the}} <b>transmitted</b> signal. Each <b>converter</b> operates at three different switching frequencies: the first is associated with bit 1 transmission, the second is associated with bit 0 transmission, and the third is associated with no transmission state. In the proposed solution, {{there is no need for}} an additional power amplifier in order to inject the communication signal on the power lines, but the signal used for the PLC is inherently generated by the pulsewidth modulation of dc–dc converters. Even if aimed at a dedicated digital IC, the communication architecture has been implemented in fieldprogrammable gate arrays. Simulation and experimental results on dc–dc synchronous buck converters confirm that the performance is achievable by the proposed PLC techniques...|$|R
5000|$|Long Island City Power Station in Hunter's Point, NY {{was built}} by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1906 in {{preparation}} for the North River Tunnels and the opening of Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. The station consisted of 64 coal-fired boilers and three steam turbine generators with a total capacity of 16 MW. In 1910, the station was expanded with two additional turbine generators for a total capacity of 32.5 MW. Power was <b>transmitted</b> to rotary <b>converters</b> (AC to DC machines) for use in the PRR's original third rail electrification scheme. Like most DC electric distribution systems of the time (Thomas Edison's being the most famous), 25 Hz power was used to drive rotary converters at substations along the line. Some sources state that the station was largely dormant by the 1920s. When AC overhead electrification was extended in the 1930s, Long Island City connected to the 11 kV catenary distribution system. Operation of the station was transferred to Consolidated Edison in 1938, although ConEd began supplying power from the adjacent Waterside Generating Station, most likely due to declining overall demand for 25 Hz power. The station was disused and sold in the mid-1950s.|$|R
40|$|Interaction {{of heavy}} ions with ideal and non-ideal plasmas {{is the key}} {{research}} activity of plasma physics at the Z 6 experimental area. The plasma can be either created by direct laser irradiation of the target or indirectly by using a two-steps heating scheme. While the direct method provides ideal-plasma conditions, the indirect heating allows the creation of non-ideal plasmas which are homogeneous over the time scale of several nanoseconds. In the proposed scheme [1] a main cylinder of 1 - 2 mm length filled with low-density CH foam is directed along the ion–beam axis. The laser heats directly {{the walls of the}} first target section, the so called converter, separated from the main target by a thin foil. Soft X-ray radiation in the energy range of 0. 3 - 2 keV with a spectral distribution close to the thermal equilibrium produces a volumetric heating of the foam up to Te = 20 - 30 eV at a particle density of 10 20 cm- 3.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to increase the independence and safety of the sight impaired by developing an enhanced travel aid {{in the form of a}} sensor embedded long-cane to reduce the risk of injury from walking into suspended or overhanging objects while providing the sight impaired community with a familiar and well accepted tool. Prior research at the Electromechanical Systems Laboratory had established a theoretical framework for ultrasound-based ranging and spatial obstacle localization from the moving reference frame of a long-cane. A prototype was implemented using analog threshold detection techniques. This research focused on a new approach. A coded pulse was transmitted and correlation techniques were used to identify echoes and determine time of flight. Compared to the prior effort this new approach was more sensitive, had greater noise immunity, and provide greater spatial resolution for obstacle detection. The first step in the coded pulse approach was to generate a transmit pulse with an embedded binary code that is highly distinguishable. A transmit pulse generated by phase modulating a 40 kHz carrier signal with a 13 -bit Barker code word, with each bit consisting of 4 cycles of the 40 kHz carrier was used. Digitized representative echoes were used as reference vectors for correlation to account for the effect of the impulse responses of the transducers, the air, and the reflection, on the transmitted pulse. In a detection cycle, the coded pulse was <b>transmitted,</b> the A/D <b>converters</b> took 2600 samples at the 150 kHz sampling rate to capture any echoes from objects between 1 and 4 meters in front of the cane. The receiver data was cross-correlated with the stored echo image to find echoes in the received signal. The correlation peak positions from the upper receiver were then compared to the peak positions from the lower receiver and if they collaborated within the synthetic aperture, the range and height were calculated annunciation was made by a synthesized voice. The new obstacle detection system described above was designed and a prototype was constructed and embedded into the shaft of an 18 mm diameter body of a long cane...|$|R
