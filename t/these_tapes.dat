While staying in one of the President's safe houses, she recorded her affair with the President. <b>These</b> <b>tapes</b> were later played in a press conference, causing great humiliation for Imelda. They stayed married through a deal; Imelda had free rein on her projects in exchange for delivering votes for Ferdinand in the second election.|$|E

25|$|The Santa Barbara County sheriff {{released}} a videotape showing Jackson's arrest. They also {{released a}}n audiotape of his ride to the police station. In it, Jackson complains about the handcuffs and is politely told by an officer how he can relieve the discomfort. He is heard to be whistling, and he asks for the air conditioning to be turned on (it was). Police allege <b>these</b> <b>tapes</b> prove that Jackson's claims are false; Jackson, along with his family, claim that what is being shown is merely a biased portion of what actually occurred. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer ordered an independent investigation into Jackson's complaints. After interviewing 163 witnesses, the complaints were rejected in August 2004.|$|E
5000|$|<b>These</b> <b>tape</b> drives were {{mechanically}} sophisticated floor-standing drives {{that used}} vacuum columns to buffer long U-shaped loops of tape. Between active control of powerful reel motors and vacuum control of <b>these</b> U-shaped <b>tape</b> loops, extremely rapid {{start and stop}} of the tape at the tape-to-head interface could be achieved. When active, the two tape reels thus fed tape into or pulled tape out of the vacuum columns, intermittently spinning in rapid, unsynchronized bursts resulting in visually striking action. Stock shots of such vacuum-column tape drives in motion were widely used to represent [...] "the computer" [...] in films and television.|$|R

25|$|In Australia, karaoke was {{gradually}} popularized {{in the late}} 1980s. A number of Filipino migrants brought with them their own 'minus-one' music from cassette music tapes and video tapes purchased mainly in the Philippines. A number of Philippine-imported karaoke units with two cassette drives were used in private households. Video TV tapes, mainly consisted of popular and contemporary songs rendered by Filipino artists, and {{with a mix of}} English and Tagalog songs were soon used. Projected lyrics on TV screens became very common as the main source of karaoke renditions. <b>These</b> <b>tapes</b> were soon replaced by CD+Gs, but a plug-n-play karaoke microphone that housed a factory built-in songchip loaded with hundreds of karaoke songs quickly became a favourite. This unit would usually be purchased in the Philippines and brought into Australia, becoming a common household item and is popularly used during gatherings.|$|E
25|$|Eno {{started the}} Obscure Records label in Britain in 1975 to release works by lesser-known composers. The {{first group of}} three {{releases}} included his own composition, Discreet Music, and the now-famous The Sinking of the Titanic (1969) and Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet (1971) by Gavin Bryars. The second side of Discreet Music consisted of several versions of Pachelbel's Canon, the composition which Eno had previously chosen to precede Roxy Music's appearances on stage, to which various algorithmic transformations have been applied, rendering it almost unrecognisable. Side one consisted of a tape loop system for generating music from relatively sparse input. <b>These</b> <b>tapes</b> had previously been used as backgrounds {{in some of his}} collaborations with Fripp, most notably on Evening Star. Only ten albums were released on Obscure, including works by John Adams, Michael Nyman, and John Cage. At this time Eno was also affiliating with artists in the Fluxus movement.|$|E

25|$|The {{international}} home release {{structure of}} Sailor Moon {{is complicated by}} the licensing and release of the companies involved in producing and distributing the work. In North America, Buena Vista Home Video distributed part of DiC's edited dub in six VHS tapes, containing two selected episodes from the first season, between 1996 and 1997. <b>These</b> <b>tapes</b> were originally available exclusively through Toys 'R' Us stores, but later saw wider distribution in other chains. A single VHS boxset containing the first 13 episodes of Sailor Moon R was also released. ADV Films later licensed the home video rights to the first two seasons, and released the DiC episodes to VHS and DVD beginning in 2001, and later released the episodes in Japanese with English subtitles in two DVD boxsets in 2003. Pioneer Entertainment (later Geneon) held the home video rights to the third and fourth seasons, and released them to VHS in three formats (edited English dubbed, uncut English dubbed, and Japanese with English subtitles) alongside uncut bilingual DVDs beginning in 2000. They later released both seasons in collected bilingual boxsets. Both ADV and Geneon's licenses expired in 2004 and 2006 respectively.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} treat {{patients}} of other species, doctors must download into their brains [...] "Educator tapes" [...] containing the necessary medical knowledge, and <b>these</b> <b>tapes</b> also transmit the personalities of their donors. As a result, doctors {{have to struggle}} with the tastes imported from their donors, ranging from a dislike of their own species' normal food to sexual attraction {{for members of the}} donor's species.

500|$|At {{the time}} the {{compilation}} was released, Madonna was riding a wave of publicity {{as a result of}} the film Evita and her pregnancy with daughter Lourdes. Bray decided to cash-in the publicity for the release, although he knew that Madonna would never approve of the album. He said in an interview with Extra that Madonna would receive royalties for the release, and added [...] "There's nothing in <b>these</b> <b>tapes</b> that would be embarrassing, and just hoping that she would like it as much as we do."

500|$|When {{necessary}} physicians, surgeons and pathologists download {{information about}} patients' species into their minds from [...] "Educator tapes", {{recordings of the}} memories of great practitioners in the appropriate species. However, in addition to medical knowledge, the educator tapes also capture the personalities of the medical experts who recorded them. Thus having an educator tape active threatens the recipient with multiple personality disorder. The new personality is from a vastly different species, often with very different behavior codes and sexual preferences, and, to make matters worse, the donors were often very dominant personalities. The mildest symptom of such conflicts is a running gag in which users of <b>these</b> <b>tapes</b> are often seen in the Sector General's cafeteria, eating a bland-looking sandwich with closed eyes. On the other hand, [...] the risk of finding members of other species sexually attractive is a serious concern.|$|E

In November, Nixon's lawyers revealed that an audio tape of conversations held in the White House on June 20, 1972 featured an 18Â½ minute gap. Rose Mary Woods, the President's personal secretary, {{claimed responsibility for the}} gap, alleging that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape, though her tale was widely mocked. The gap, while not conclusive proof of wrongdoing by the President, cast doubt on Nixon's statement that he had been unaware of the cover-up.|$|E

[...] <b>These</b> <b>tapes</b> gained widespread negative publicityâ€”with news stories that described these practices as perverted and a form of brainwashing.
