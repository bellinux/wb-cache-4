5000|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of jet service at Pueblo, the {{original}} Frontier Airlines operated nonstop and direct flights to Denver and Santa Fe, NM with Convair 580 <b>turboprops</b> and flew direct to Albuquerque, Phoenix, Tucson and other cities in Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico. Central Airlines Convair 600 <b>turboprops</b> flew nonstop to Denver and Amarillo as well as direct to Kansas City and other cities in Kansas. The original Frontier Airlines acquired Central in October 1967. Continental Airlines served Pueblo in the early 1960s with Vickers Viscount four engine <b>turboprops</b> with service to Denver, Albuquerque, Santa Fe and El Paso. Later, Rocky Mountain Airways de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters and DHC-7 Dash 7s flew nonstop or direct to Denver. Rocky Mountain Airways later operated Continental Express service to Denver on behalf of Continental Airlines with ATR 42 and Beechcraft 1900 <b>turboprops.</b> [...] Mesa Airlines flying as United Express on behalf of United Airlines also operated service to Denver with Beechcraft 1900 <b>turboprops.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Bristol Type 175 Britannia was a British medium-to-long-range {{airliner}} {{built by}} the Bristol Aeroplane Company in 1952 to fly across the British Empire. During development two prototypes were lost and the <b>turboprop</b> engines proved susceptible to inlet icing which delayed entry into service while solutions were sought.|$|E
5|$|The Flight 825 {{aircraft}} was a Vickers Viscount 782D, a British-made <b>turboprop</b> aircraft with two engines on each wing. It {{was named the}} Hunyani after the river of the same name, which flowed between Lake Kariba and the Rhodesian capital Salisbury.|$|E
5|$|The Osprey is the world's first {{production}} tiltrotor aircraft, {{with one}} three-bladed proprotor, <b>turboprop</b> engine, and transmission nacelle mounted on each wingtip. It {{is classified as}} a powered lift aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration. For takeoff and landing, it typically operates as a helicopter with the nacelles vertical and rotors horizontal. Once airborne, the nacelles rotate forward 90° {{in as little as}} 12 seconds for horizontal flight, converting the V-22 to a more fuel-efficient, higher speed <b>turboprop</b> aircraft. STOL rolling-takeoff and landing capability is achieved by having the nacelles tilted forward up to 45°. Other orientations are possible. It has a ferry range of over 2,100 nmi. Its operational range is 1,100 nmi.|$|E

5|$|The F-84 was {{the first}} {{production}} fighter aircraft to utilize inflight refueling and the first fighter capable of carrying a nuclear weapon, the Mark 7 nuclear bomb.

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{successful}} contract bid in June 1946, the B-52 design {{evolved from a}} straight wing aircraft powered by six <b>turboprop</b> engines to the final prototype YB-52 with eight turbojet engines and swept wings. The B-52 took its maiden flight in April 1952. Built to carry nuclear weapons for Cold War-era deterrence missions, the B-52 Stratofortress replaced the Convair B-36. A veteran of several wars, the B-52 has dropped only conventional munitions in combat. The B-52's official name Stratofortress is rarely used; informally, the aircraft has become {{commonly referred to as}} the BUFF (Big Ugly Fat Fucker).|$|E

5|$|Bristol won the Type I and Type III contracts, {{delivering}} their Type I design, the Bristol Brabazon in 1949. The {{requirement for}} the 1946 British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Medium Range Empire (MRE) Requirements coincided with the Type III, Specification C.2/47, issued in April 1947 by the Minister of Supply. The specifications called for an airliner capable of carrying 48 passengers and powered with Bristol Centaurus radial engines or Napier Nomad turbo-compound diesel engine. <b>Turboprop</b> options were also considered, but they were so new that Bristol could not guarantee the performance specifications.|$|E
5|$|Business {{aviation}} {{has shown}} strong growth, although {{the numbers of}} aircraft on the UK register have declined. This reflects a shift away from <b>turboprop</b> aircraft towards foreign-registered business jets based in the UK, which {{are estimated to be}} growing in numbers. However, twin piston-engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly, reflecting pressures on the light air-taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services, and a more sophisticated corporate charter business. The amount of flight training conducted by UK schools has declined, largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools, which benefit from lower costs and better weather.|$|E
5|$|The F-84 {{nomenclature}} can {{be somewhat}} confusing. The straight-wing F-84A to F-84E and F-84G models were called the Thunderjet. The F-84F Thunderstreak and RF-84F Thunderflash were different airplanes with swept wings. The XF-84H Thunderscreech (not its official name) was an experimental <b>turboprop</b> {{version of the}} F-84F. The F-84F swept wing version {{was intended to be}} a small variation of the normal Thunderjet with only a few different parts, so it kept the basic F-84 number. Production delays on the F-84F resulted in another order of the straight-wing version; this was the F-84G.|$|E
