50|$|For most verbs, {{the verbal}} {{adjective}} is {{nearly the same}} as the present participle, however the verbal adjectif is inflected as an adjective, e.g. le garçon sautant (<b>the</b> <b>jumping</b> boy), la fille sautante (<b>the</b> <b>jumping</b> girl), les garçons sautants (<b>the</b> <b>jumping</b> boys), les filles sautantes (<b>the</b> <b>jumping</b> girls). This is called the Present verbal adjective (Adjectif verbal présent). The past participle can act as the Past verbal adjective (Adjectif verbal passé) (e.g. la fille sauvée (the girl that has been rescued)).|$|R
5|$|Because the {{aircraft}} was fully booked, a passenger {{was allowed to}} sit in <b>the</b> <b>jump</b> seat in the cockpit. The passenger had no connection with the airline, but was granted permission by the captain via acquaintance in the airline. Several of the other passengers were employees in Widerøe and shouldaccording to the airline's rulesinstead have been seated there. From Namsos to Brønnøysund there were available seats in the cabin, but <b>the</b> <b>jump</b> seat passenger continued {{to sit in the}} cockpit. The commission felt that the passenger's conversation with the captain drew his attention and concentration away from his duties at a critical point of the flight. This also disrupted communication between the two pilots, resulting in the mutual control being disrupted.|$|E
5|$|Energy and {{momentum}} are conserved {{only on the}} average in interactions between matter and radiation, but not in elementary processes such as absorption and emission. This allows one to reconcile the discontinuously changing energy of the atom (<b>the</b> <b>jump</b> between energy states) with the continuous release of energy as radiation.|$|E
5|$|Ryu has {{the ability}} to jump on and off ladders and walls, and by using the {{directional}} pad, he can climb up or down ladders. Ryu can spring off walls by holding the directional pad in the opposite direction he is facing and pressing <b>the</b> <b>jump</b> button. He cannot attack while on walls or ladders. Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between walls and columns by holding down <b>the</b> <b>jump</b> button and alternating between left and right on the directional pad. Ryu can also vertically climb a single wall by springing off it and then quickly pressing the directional pad back towards the wall.|$|E
50|$|The final {{started at}} 2.30 p.m. {{on the same}} day. <b>The</b> <b>jumping</b> order is not {{available}} and <b>the</b> <b>jumping</b> series are only known for the medalists.|$|R

50|$|In Amsterdam he also {{competed in}} <b>the</b> <b>jumping</b> events. In <b>the</b> {{individual}} <b>jumping</b> he finished in 27th {{place and the}} Dutch team placed tenth in <b>the</b> team <b>jumping</b> competition.|$|R
5|$|The {{aircraft}} made a stop-over at Namsos, where sixteen of {{the passengers}} disembarked. This {{reduced the number of}} passengers on board to thirty-three, but the passenger occupying <b>the</b> <b>jump</b> seat continued to sit there on the next leg. The captain was the flying pilot for the segment. The aircraft departed Namsos at 20:07 and contacted Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center (ATCC) at 20:13 to receive permission to ascend to flight level 90 (FL 90), which was received. During the flight, the passenger in <b>the</b> <b>jump</b> seat held a conversation with the captain and asked several questions regarding the operations. The first officer did not participate in this discussions, and it was he who conducted radio contact with air traffic control and the airline's operations' center.|$|E
5|$|Following his promotion, Harvey took a {{leave of}} absence from the Navy which would last three years. He stood for {{parliament}} in the seat of Maldon in Essex, which he won in 1780 and represented for the next four years. In 1781 Harvey briefly commanded HMS Dolphin, but took leave once again four months later. In 1782 Harvey again returned to the Navy just as peace was agreed and was promoted to commander on 21 March 1782, briefly taking over the sloop HMS Otter before rapidly making <b>the</b> <b>jump</b> to Post Captain less than a year later, on 20 January 1783.|$|E
5|$|Formby's ENSA {{commitments}} were heavy, touring factories, theatres {{and concert}} halls around Britain. He also gave free concerts for charities and worthy causes, and raised £10,000 for the Fleetwood Fund {{on behalf of}} the families of missing trawlermen. He and Beryl also set up their own charities, such as the OK Club for Kids, whose aim was to provide cigarettes for Yorkshire soldiers, and <b>the</b> <b>Jump</b> Fund, to provide home-knitted balaclavas, scarves and socks to servicemen. Formby also joined the Home Guard as a dispatch rider, where he took his duties seriously, and fitted them around his other work whenever he could.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we study}} <b>the</b> <b>jumping</b> numbers {{of an ideal}} in the local ring at {{rational}} singularity on a complex algebraic surface.

This shows, in particular, how to compute <b>the</b> <b>jumping</b> numbers of a plane curve from the numerical data of its minimal resolution. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>jumping</b> numbers of <b>the</b> maximal ideal at the singular point in a Du Val or toric surface singularity are computed, and applications to the smooth case are explored.

40|$|We report magnetotransport {{measurements}} on bilayer GaAs hole systems with unequal hole {{concentrations in the}} two layers. At magnetic fields where one layer is in the integer quantum Hall state and the other has bulk extended states at the Fermi energy, the longitudinal and Hall resistances of the latter are hysteretic, in agreement with previous measurements. For a fixed magnetic field inside this region and at low temperatures (T< 350 mK), the time evolutions of the longitudinal and Hall resistances show pronounced jumps followed by slow relaxations, with no end to <b>the</b> sequence of <b>jumps.</b> Our measurements demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>jumps</b> occur simultaneously in pairs of contacts 170 μm apart, and appear to involve changes in the charge configuration of the bilayer. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>jumps</b> can occur with either random or regular periods, excluding thermal fluctuations as a possible origin for <b>the</b> <b>jumps.</b> Finally, while remaining at a fixed field, we warm the sample to above 350 mK, where <b>the</b> <b>jumps</b> disappear. Upon recooling the sample below this temperature, <b>the</b> <b>jumps</b> reappear, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>jumps</b> do not result from nearly dissipationless eddy currents either...|$|R
5|$|Hysterical Lydia, {{who thought}} Sarah and Zoe were having an affair, had a {{conversation}} with Charlotte and revealed when they split up, she attempted suicide, proving the character's vulnerability. After sabotaging Zoe's parachute, they are mixed up and a terrified Lydia began to worry that she might have got the sabotaged parachute. While doing <b>the</b> <b>jump,</b> Zoe's deploys, however Sarah's does not. As she hits the ground, Lydia screams in terror. She is completely destroyed by Sarah's death, but does not admit to being responsible when Zoe is arrested, and with that Lydia tries to commit suicide once again.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Montreal-based {{publisher}} Drawn and Quarterly {{began with}} an anthology title also named Drawn and Quarterly. It quickly picked up {{a number of other}} titles, such as Julie Doucet's semi-autobiographical, bilingual Dirty Plotte, which, like Yummy Fur, had started out as a minicomic; Seth's Palookaville; illegal resident from the US Joe Matt's Peepshow; and Yummy Fur, which made <b>the</b> <b>jump</b> with its twenty-fifth issue. At the time, an autobiographical comics trend took place. Brown, Seth and Matt in particular were thought of as a Toronto comics rat pack, depicting one another in their comics and doing signings and interviews together.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, he {{collaborated with}} Masakazu Katsura, {{his good friend}} and creator of I"s and Zetman, for <b>the</b> <b>Jump</b> SQ {{one-shot}} Sachie-chan Good!!. It was published in North America in the free SJ Alpha Yearbook 2013, which was mailed out to annual subscribers of the digital manga magazine Shonen Jump Alpha in December 2012. The two worked together again in 2009, for the three-chapter one-shot Jiya in Weekly Young Jump.|$|E
50|$|In free jumping, a chute is used {{to direct}} the horse over <b>the</b> <b>jumps.</b> <b>The</b> chute {{consists}} of all <b>the</b> <b>jumps</b> in <b>the</b> line {{as well as a}} small stretch for entry and exit so the horse approaches and leaves <b>the</b> <b>jumps</b> straight. <b>The</b> width of the chute is the width of the poles for <b>the</b> <b>jumps.</b> <b>The</b> “walls” of the chutes usually consist of jumping poles at a height above <b>the</b> highest <b>jump</b> with additional poles underneath if there is a chance the horse will try to go under the poles. This is to discourage any refusals and make the horse face <b>the</b> <b>jumps</b> head on without them seeing an easier way out. <b>The</b> series of <b>jumps</b> should increase in height down the line to allow the horse to get going before faced with a large <b>jump.</b> <b>The</b> striding between <b>jumps</b> can vary depending on what the trainer wants to achieve. When starting a horse in free jumping {{it is a good idea}} to start with fewer and lower jumps until a horse is comfortable and then increase the difficulty. A good practice is to lead the horse through the chute the first time and work towards either running the horse to the chute and letting it go, or sending the horse through the chute without having to touch it.|$|R

5|$|In Paris it {{was planned}} that two stunt men, B.J. Worth and Don Caldvedt, would help film two takes of a {{parachute}} drop off a (clearly visible) platform that extended from a {{top edge of}} the Eiffel Tower. However, sufficient footage was obtained from Worth's jump, so Caldvedt was told {{he would not be}} performing his own jump. Caldvedt, unhappy at not being able to perform <b>the</b> <b>jump,</b> parachuted off the tower without authorisation from the City of Paris. He was subsequently sacked by the production team for jeopardising the continuation of filming in the city.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s blues music was largely known in Britain through blues-influenced boogie-woogie, and <b>the</b> <b>jump</b> blues of Fats Waller and Louis Jordan. Imported {{recordings}} of American artists were brought over by African American servicemen stationed in Britain {{during and after}} World War II, merchant seamen visiting the ports of London, Liverpool, Newcastle on Tyne and Belfast, and in a trickle of (illegal) imports. From 1955 major British record labels HMV and EMI (the latter, particularly through their subsidiary Decca Records), began to distribute American jazz and increasingly blues records to the emerging market.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning Sissener {{suggests}} the two go driving blindfolded. The stunt goes surprisingly well, but as Sissener pulls over the car, he dies. Odd is now left with responsibility for Sissener's dog and with an urgency to live life to the fullest. He makes {{his way up to}} the Holmenkollen ski jump, where he sees a vision of his mother as a young woman, doing <b>the</b> <b>jump.</b> He comes to a decision and starts to do the ski jump. Odd, for the first time no longer wearing his railwayman's jacket, rides the train to Bergen, where Svea is happily waiting for him on the platform.|$|E

5|$|Lesbians in the U.S. are {{estimated}} to be about 2.6% of the population, according to a National Opinion Research Center survey of sexually active adults who had had same-sex experiences within the past year, completed in 2000. A survey of same-sex couples in the United States showed that between 2000 and 2005, the number of people claiming to be in same-sex relationships increased by 30%—five times the rate of population growth in the U.S. The study attributed <b>the</b> <b>jump</b> to people being more comfortable self-identifying as homosexual to the federal government.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies certain invariants of singularities {{of complex}} algebraic surfaces. In the first main result, {{we show that}} all integrally closed ideals on log terminal surfaces are multiplier ideals by extending an existing proof for smooth surfaces. Next, we turn {{our attention to the}} computation of <b>the</b> <b>jumping</b> numbers of an ideal in the local ring of a surface at a rational singularity. By understanding the contributions of reduced divisors on a fixed resolution, we are able to present an algorithm for finding <b>the</b> <b>jumping</b> numbers of <b>the</b> ideal. This shows, in particular, how to compute <b>the</b> <b>jumping</b> numbers of any plane curve from the numerical data of its minimal resolution. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>jumping</b> numbers of <b>the</b> maximal ideal at the singular point in a Du Val or toric surface singularity are computed, and applications to the smooth case are explored. We end by giving a new and insightful computation of <b>the</b> <b>jumping</b> numbers of <b>the</b> germ of a unibranch plane curve...|$|R
