5|$|Austria and Switzerland {{are both}} {{members of the}} Partnership for Peace, and border NATO member states. Malta {{is also a member}} of the Partnership for Peace and the European Union. However, each country has a long-standing policy of neutrality. Cyprus is the only Member state of the European Union that is not a member of the Partnership for Peace, with any treaty blocked by Turkey's {{concerns}} regarding the Cyprus dispute. According to Minister of Foreign Affairs Enver Hoxhaj, integration with NATO is a priority for Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. Hoxhaj stated in 2014 that the country's goal is to be a NATO member by 2022. However, four NATO member states, Greece, Romania, Spain, and Slovakia, do not recognize Kosovo's independence. United Nations membership, which Kosovo does not have, is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> for NATO membership.|$|E
5|$|Christian baptismal {{theology}} {{prior to}} the Reformation taught that sacraments, including baptism, are means or instruments through which God communicates grace to people. The sacrament was considered valid regardless of who administered it. Not everyone who received a sacrament, however, received the grace signified by the sacrament. Some medieval theologians spoke of an obstacle of mortal sin which blocks the grace of the sacrament, while others insisted that the recipient be positively open and responding in faith to the sacrament {{in order to receive}} any benefit. Baptism was believed to be used by the Holy Spirit to transform the believer, and offered the benefits of remission of sins, regeneration, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The sacrament of penance was believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> for forgiveness for sins committed after baptism.|$|E
5|$|During {{the offseason}} that followed, the new Red Sox {{ownership}} (led by John W.

Believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> {{in pursuit of a}} trade for Texas Rangers shortstop Alex Rodriguez, the team put Ramirez on irrevocable waivers, thus making him available to any team willing to assume the remainder of his contract. However, all 29 other teams passed on the opportunity to claim Ramirez due to the high cost, and Rodriguez was acquired by the Yankees instead, rather ironically as a replacement for Boone after the latter had blown out his knee playing offseason basketball.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the revolution of 1905, Tsar Nicholas II accepted a series of liberal reforms in his October Manifesto, after which Lenin felt it safe to return to St. Petersburg. Joining {{the editorial board of}} Novaya Zhizn ("New Life"), a radical legal newspaper run by Maria Andreyeva, he used it to discuss issues facing the RSDLP. He encouraged the party to seek out a much wider membership, and advocated the continual escalation of violent confrontation, believing both <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> for a successful revolution. Recognising that membership fees and donations from a few wealthy sympathisers were insufficient to finance the Bolsheviks' activities, Lenin endorsed the idea of robbing post offices, railway stations, trains, and banks. Under the lead of Leonid Krasin, a group of Bolsheviks began carrying out such criminal actions, the best known taking place in June 1907, when a group of Bolsheviks acting under the leadership of Joseph Stalin committed an armed robbery of the State Bank in Tiflis, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Methoxyflurane has a {{very high}} lipid {{solubility}} (oil:gas partition coefficient of around 950), which gives it very slow pharmacokinetics (induction and emergence characteristics); this being undesirable for routine application in the clinical setting. Initial studies performed in 1961 revealed that in unpremedicated healthy individuals, induction of general anesthesia with methoxyflurane-oxygen alone or with nitrous oxide was difficult or even impossible using the vaporizers available at that time. It was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to administer an intravenous anesthetic agent such as sodium thiopental to ensure a smooth and rapid induction. It was further found that after thiopental induction, {{it was necessary to}} administer nitrous oxide for at least ten minutes before a sufficient amount of methoxyflurane could accumulate in the bloodstream to ensure an adequate level of anesthesia. This was despite using high flow (liters/minute) of nitrous oxide and oxygen, and with the vaporizers delivering the maximum possible concentration of methoxyflurane.|$|E
5|$|Not all ticks in an infective {{area are}} {{infected}} with pathogens, and both attachment of the tick and a long-feeding session seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> for transmission of these diseases to take place. Thus tick bites often do not lead to infection, especially if the ticks are removed within 36 hours. Adult ticks can be removed with fine-tipped tweezers or proprietary tick removal tools, disinfecting the wound. It is also possible to freeze them off with a medical wart remover. If the tick's head and mouthparts break off during removal, they can be removed with tweezers like a splinter.|$|E

5|$|Oral {{antibiotics}} {{are recommended}} for {{no longer than}} three months as antibiotic courses exceeding this duration {{are associated with the}} development of antibiotic resistance and show no clear benefit over shorter courses. Furthermore, if long-term oral antibiotics beyond three months are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary,</b> it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide and/or a retinoid be used {{at the same time to}} limit the risk of P. acnes developing antibiotic resistance. Dapsone is not a first-line topical antibiotic due to higher cost and lack of clear superiority over other antibiotics. Topical dapsone is not recommended for use with benzoyl peroxide due to yellow-orange skin discoloration with this combination.|$|E
5|$|The Einsatzgruppen had {{its origins}} in the ad hoc Einsatzkommando formed by Heydrich {{following}} the Anschluss in Austria in March 1938. Two units of Einsatzgruppen were stationed in the Sudetenland in October 1938. When military action turned out not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> because of the Munich Agreement, the Einsatzgruppen were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents. They secured government buildings, questioned senior civil servants, and arrested as many as 10,000 Czech communists and German citizens. The Einsatzgruppen also followed Wehrmacht troops and killed potential partisans. Similar groups were used in 1939 for the occupation of Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|The Einsatzgruppen {{were formed}} under the {{direction}} of SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich and operated by the Schutzstaffel (SS) before and during World War II. The Einsatzgruppen had its origins in the ad hoc Einsatzkommando formed by Heydrich to secure government buildings and documents following the Anschluss in Austria in March 1938. Originally part of the Sicherheitspolizei (Security Police; SiPo), two units of Einsatzgruppen were stationed in the Sudetenland in October 1938. When military action turned out not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> due to the Munich Agreement, the Einsatzgruppen were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents. They also secured government buildings, questioned senior civil servants, and arrested as many as 10,000 Czech communists and German citizens.

5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{existing}} airport infrastructure to meet forecast demand is limited, and government policy published in 2003 supports the development of additional airport capacity by 2030 to address this. The strategy is generally based on making {{the best use of}} existing facilities, although an additional five new runways nationwide are considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary,</b> three of them at the London airports of Stansted, Heathrow and, {{towards the end of the}} timeframe involved, Gatwick. This policy is designed to be a balanced and measured approach to the future of the air transport industry; one that recognises both an economic advantage in providing for growth in demand for air travel and also the need to address the consequent environmental impacts. The strategy has been criticised by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee, by environmentalist and campaign groups, and in research papers, for implementing a predict and provide model that overstates the economic advantages whilst paying insufficient heed to the environmental consequences.|$|E
5|$|About a {{third to}} a half of {{individuals}} with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from {{the first year of}} life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, {{and are more likely to}} simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E
5|$|Lenin had {{not wanted}} {{to return to the}} Russian Empire, fearing arrest. He changed his opinion when Tsar Nicholas II {{accepted}} a series of liberal reforms in his October Manifesto, with Lenin believing that these would protect him from the Okhrana. Thus, Lenin and his wife returned to Russia in cognito via Sweden and Finland, moving between different safe houses in St. Petersburg, from which he monitored events and wrote up many of his ideas on the progress of the revolution. He was invited to join the editorial board of Novaya Zhizn (New Life), a radical legal newspaper run by Maxim Gorky's wife M.F. Andreyeva, and used this as a vehicle to discuss issues facing the RSDLP. He encouraged the party to seek out a much wider membership, and also advocated the continual escalation of violent confrontation, believing both <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> for the revolution to succeed. However, after the armed Moscow Uprising failed, Lenin began to urge the party to stand in elections for the Duma, believing that this would raise the party's public profile. At a Bolshevik Congress in Tampere, Finland, Lenin first met young Bolshevik Joseph Stalin. He also changed his mind {{on the issue of the}} Mensheviks, and began calling for reconciliation between the party's two factions. Members of both groups met at the 4th Party Congress in Stockholm, Sweden in April 1906 where the Mensheviks condemned Lenin for supporting bank robberies and encouraging violence. The Congress resulted in the election of a new Central Committee comprising 7 Mensheviks and 3 Bolsheviks.|$|E
