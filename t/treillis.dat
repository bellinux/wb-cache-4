50|$|The trellis was {{originally}} intended to support vine stock — which gives its name : lat Trichila = greenery bower.Though it is unknown when and where the trellis was invented, the trellis has been mentioned in literature and botanical works throughout history. Pliny the Younger, {{in the first and}} second centuries, wrote about trellises in some of his letters about gardens. In the 19th century, Walt Whitman also mentioned a trellis in his poem Give me the Splendid, Silent Sun.Trellis was used to support shrubs in espalier, also to separate roads from thickets and diverse sections of vegetable gardens. These sorts of fences were made by the gardeners. When the art of gardening was perfected by André Le Nôtre and Jules Hardouin-Mansart, the <b>treillis</b> became an object of decoration and was entrusted to particular workers named treillageurs. They worked individually until 1769, when they joined the corporation of carpenters. The treillageur has to have at least some elementary notions and principles of architecture and l’art du trait.Could trellis be designed as a gallery, portico, room, and different element of architecture thus evolved into garden architecture linked to landscaping.In the 20th Century landscape architects such as Edouard François and Lewis Duncan, Gilles Clément, uses trellis, as well as artists such as Nils Udo or Jean-Max Albert whose spacial creations belong to land art, Site specific art, or Environmental sculpture.|$|E

30|$|It must be {{mentioned}} here that although efficient, the MS-VQs {{used in this}} study are not the best quantizers available. For instance, we have not used fully optimized (i.e., using <b>treillis</b> search as in [30]) MS-VQ, but basic (i.e., sequential search) MS-VQ. Also, more sophisticated frame-wise methods have been proposed to obtain transparent LSF quantization at rates lower than the ones required for MS-VQ, but at the cost of increased complexity [35, 36]. Refined versions of split-VQ are also good candidates for improved performances. We restricted ourselves with a relatively simple VQ technique because the goal {{of the present study was}} primarily to show the interest of the long-term approach. Therefore, it is very likely that the performances of the proposed LT coding algorithm can be significantly improved by using high-performance (but more complex) quantizers, 13 since the reduced set of LSF vectors may be quantized with lower ASD/resolution compared to the MS-VQ. In contrast, it seems very difficult to improve the performances of the reference 2 D-transform methods, since we used optimal (non-uniform) quantizers to encode the corresponding 2 D coefficients.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the iterative decoding of channels with strong phase noise. We propose to use a random discrete measure to estimate the phase posterior pdf given the past observations (forward pdf) and another random discrete measure to estimate the phase posterior pdf given the future observations (backward pdf). The particle filter algorithm is used to recursively generate the supports in the relevant phase space area and recursively update the weights associated to these supports. An estimation of the phase posterior pdf given all the past and future observations is then derived from the forward and backward measures. The relevance of our proposal is finally illustrated through simulation of binary LDPC codes and QPSK modulation over a severe Wiener-Levy phase noise {{with a standard deviation}} of σΔ = 6 degrees.

Most of the observations {{made during the}} reconnaissance visits confirmed the current knowledge on the inelastic response of these structural systems. This permits the anticipation of proper seismic behavior for buildings designed according to the seismic provisions that have been recently introduced in the Canadian building code and standard for steel structures. In some cases, however, the observed damage raised concerns that should be addressed in future investigations or next editions of these codes. Preventing potentially hazardous nonstructural damage, avoiding premature nonductile failures anywhere along the lateral load paths, limiting structural and nonstructural damage due to brace buckling, and accounting for the vertical ground motion are among those issues.

40|$|Algorithms for the {{parallel}} evaluation of expressions and arithmetic circuits {{may be considered}} as extractors of the intrinsic parallelism contained in sequential programs; far beyond {{the parallel}}ism that can be read from the dependence graph, this parallelism comes from {{the meaning of the}} operators that are employed. The knowledge of their algebraic properties, such as associativity or distributivity, allows the reorganization of the computations without affecting the results. The more the algebraic structure used in the program possesses such properties, the more they can be taken into account to speed up the parallel evaluation of the program. We generalize the algorithms designed for programs over semi-rings in order to propose an algorithm, the complexity of which improves previously known upper bounds for the evaluation of arithmetic circuits over lattices. Simulations of this algorithm highlight its power as an ``automatic complexity predictor''. Furthermore, the explicit reorganization of the computations by means of these evaluation algorithms, by means of a complete compilation, helps to compare real algorithms for distributed memory machines with theoretical parallel ones. A prototype of the compiler has been developed, based on a simplification/extension of the C language. Then, the use of these techniques in the area of automatic parallelization of nested loops is discussed: they can help the detection of hidden reductions in these nested loops in an easy and efficient way, by providing relevant information on the probability of the existence of reductions. This last point proves that the design of theoretical parallel algorithms is related to the search for effective parallelization. Les algorithmes d'evaluation parallele des expressions et des circuits arithmetiques peuvent etre vus comme des extracteurs du parallelisme intrinseque contenu dans les programmes sequentiels, parallelisme qui depasse celui qui peut etre lu sur le graphe de precedence et qui tient a la semantique des operateurs utilises. La connaissance des proprietes algebriques, comme l'associativite ou la distributivite, permet une reorganisation des calculs qui n'affecte pas les resultats. Plus la structure algebrique utilisee sera riche en proprietes, plus il sera possible d'en tirer parti pour ameliorer les algorithmes d'evaluation. Generalisant les algorithmes concus pour les semi-anneaux, nous proposons un algorithme qui ameliore les majorations precedemment connues pour la contraction de circuits arithmetiques dans un <b>treillis.</b> Des simulations de cet algorithme ont permis de mettre en evidence ses qualites de >.

40|$|In this study, {{we looked}} {{for a way to}} replace query by {{navigation}} to search for images in an image collection or a database. Our work resulted in a technique based on Galois' lattices, a graph structure that shown to be useful for both indexing and retrieval by grouping images sharing common properties. While lacking precision for users who need detailed queries, it is an easy-to-use yet powerful search for users who prefer to browse fastly an important set of images. This Galois' latticesbased technique could be applied to other media type, but it is particularly adapted to images since it is a still media that can be visualised quickly even in a reduced format. On the one hand an image search based on navigation through Galois' lattice had several advantages: – Navigation is very fast, – a Galois' lattice is intrinsically a multi-dimensional classification technique, – the tool is insensitive to correlations, – it helps to correct users' mistakes very easily, – the Galois' lattice structure easily hides unwanted features. But there were also notable drawbacks, the biggest problem being the lack of scalability. We addressed the scalability problem by combining the Galois' lattice to a clustering technique; then we improved the structure quality by taking global properties into account, without increasing the algorithmic complexity of the lattice construction. Finally, we introduced a user personalisation process {{to take into account the}} different needs of users. Compared to other techniques based on navigation, the specificity of our approach is to be solely based on a before-hand calculated structure, launching no query. Consequently, it is extremely fast and responsive, allowing user to go and back through the structure without having to wait for a query result processing. The main application we thought for our proposal is a structure to build a static collection, for example the catalogue of an image provider. However, the construction algorithm being incremental it can be used for a dynamic collection, since the collection does not exceed a certain size (a few thousands of images using the basic proposal). Les données dites multimédia (images, vidéos) se distinguent des données classique par une densité variable d'information et l'impossibilité de normaliser ces données. Du fait de ces particularités, de nouvelles techniques d'indexation et de recherche d'information ont du être etudiées. Il y a principalement deux problèmes a résoudre pour la recherche d'information dans les collections multimédia (ou les bases de données multimédia) : (1) la représentation des données et (2) le processus de recherche du point de vue de l'utilisateur. Dans le cas des bases de données, l'indexation est fortement liée a ces deux problèmes. Dans le cas particulier des images, on distingue trois grandes classes: – la recherche par requêtes formelles, héritée des bases de données classiques; – la recherche avec boucle de retour, où l'utilisateur fait partie intégrante du processus de recherche; – la navigation où les images sont organisées en une structure preparée à l'avance, utilisée comme index et comme structure de recherche.
