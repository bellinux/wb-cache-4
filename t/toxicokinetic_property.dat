40|$|International audienceSecond-generation {{anticoagulant}} rodenticides (SGARs) {{have been}} used since the 1980 s for pest management. They are highly efficient even in warfarin-resistant rodents. Nevertheless, because of their tissue persistence, nontarget poisoning by SGARs is commonly described in wildlife. Due to this major problem, {{a new generation of}} anticoagulants must be developed to limit this risk. This study proposes a method of developing a new generation of anticoagulant rodenticides by revisiting the old SGARs based on the concept of stereochemistry. Each current SGAR is a mixture of diastereomers. Diastereomers of each compound were purified, and their biologic properties were compared by determining their ability to inhibit vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) activity involved in the activation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and their <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>properties.</b> Systematically, for each SGAR, both diastereomers are as effective in inhibiting VKOR activity. However, their <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>properties</b> are very different, with one of the two diastereomers always more rapidly cleared than the other one. For all SGARs except flocoumafen, the less persistent diastereomer is always the less predominant isomer present in the current mixture. Therefore, the development of baits containing only the less persistent diastereomer would avoid the ecotoxicological risk associated with their use without decreasing their efficacy...|$|R

Confirmation of the suspected toxicosis {{was obtained by}} detecting colchicine in serum and urine using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. Although the serum colchicine concentration had declined to an apparently nontoxic level of 2. 4 ng/ml, a more prominent concentration (640 ng/ml) indicative of colchicine poisoning was detected in the urine. This {{finding is consistent with}} the known <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>properties</b> of colchicine, whereby a large volume of distribution results in low circulating blood concentrations and prolonged urinary excretion...|$|R
40|$|CD 47 is {{a widely}} {{expressed}} cell surface protein that functions as a regulator of phagocyto-sis mediated by cells of the innate immune system, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. CD 47 serves as the ligand for a receptor on these innate immune cells, SIRP-alpha, which in turn delivers an inhibitory signal for phagocytosis. We previously found increased expression of CD 47 on primary human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) stem cells, and dem-onstrated that blocking monoclonal antibodies directed against CD 47 enabled the phagocy-tosis and elimination of AML, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), and many solid tumors in xenograft models. Here, we report {{the development of a}} humanized anti-CD 47 antibody with potent efficacy and favorable <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>properties</b> as a candidate therapeutic. A novel monoclonal anti-human CD 47 antibody, 5 F 9, was generated, and antibody humani-zation was carried out by grafting its complementarity determining regions (CDRs) onto a human IgG 4 format. The resulting humanized 5 F 9 antibody (Hu 5 F 9 -G 4) bound monomeric human CD 47 with an 8 nM affinity. Hu 5 F 9 -G 4 induced potent macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of primary human AML cells in vitro and completely eradicated human AML i...|$|R
40|$|To {{estimate}} the health {{risk of a}} specific {{part of the population}} due to an environmental factor, the exposure can be measured and consecutively evaluated by means of toxicity data from the literature. To facilitate the choice between parameters of external exposure (ExEx) versus biomarkers of exposure (BmEx), a guideline is proposed, which consists of eleven considerations. (1) Local effects (directly on airways, eyes or skin) usually require ExEx, whereas systemic effects call for BmEx. (2) Determination of the contribution of a specific, environmental source among multiple, e. g., non-environmental sources of a substance calls for ExEx. (3) The availability of a reliable exposure-response relationship for the effect considered and of a health-based limit value; theoretically a relationship based on BmEx can be more reliable. (4) The possibility to determine reliably the exposure data that are needed, depending on the time and duration of the sampling with respect to the pattern of the external exposure, on the number of samples, and the <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>properties.</b> (5) Inconvenient route of entry points to BmEx. (6) The presence of a group at risk due to intake-related behaviour or toxicokinetics calls for BmEx. (7) In the case of non-specificity of BmEx due to other substances the increase or decrease of the effect predicting value should be evaluated. (8) Substantial probability of effects calls for BmEx. (9) Feasibility of sampling technique and reliability of the analysis. (10) Acceptance by the public points to BmEx. (11) Cost-effectiveness. Several examples illustrate this guidelin...|$|R
40|$|Certain drugs {{containing}} a nitroaromatic moiety (e. g., tolcapone, nimesulide, nilutamide, flutamide, nitrofurantoin) {{have been associated}} with organ-selective toxicity including rare cases of idiosyncratic liver injury. What they have in common is the potential for multistep nitroreductive bioactivation (6 -electron transfer) that produces the potentially hazardous nitroanion radical, nitroso intermediate, and N-hydroxy derivative. These intermediates {{have been associated with}} increased oxidant stress and targeting of nucleophilic residues on proteins and nucleic acids. However, other mechanisms including the formation of oxidative metabolites and mitochondrial liability, as well as inherent <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>properties,</b> also determine the drugs&# 039; overall potency. Therefore, structural modification not only of the nitro moiety but also of ring substituents can greatly reduce toxicity. Novel concepts have revealed that, besides the classical microsomal nitroreductases, cytosolic and mitochondrial enzymes including nitric oxide synthase can also bioactivate certain nitroarenes (nilutamide). Furthermore, animal models of silent mitochondrial dysfunction have demonstrated that a mitochondrial oxidant stress posed by certain nitroaromatic drugs (nimesulide) can produce significant mitochondrial injury if superimposed on a genetic mitochondrial abnormality. Finally, there may be mechanisms for all nitroaromatic drugs that do not involve bioactivation of the nitro group, e. g., AHR interactions with flutamide. Taken together, the focus of research on the hepatic toxicity of nitroarene-containing drugs has shifted over the past years from the identification of the reactive intermediates generated during the bioreductive pathway to the underlying biomechanisms of liver injury. Most likely one of the next paradigm shifts will include the identification of determinants of susceptibility to nitroaromatic drug-induced hepatotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|For human risk {{assessments}} extrapolation of experimental {{data to the}} real human exposure situation is required. In this context the REACH guidance document has proposed default extrapolation factors for inter-species differences, {{as well as for}} differences in duration of exposure. Already several groups have analysed interspecies and time-extrapolation factors, but predominately based on limited datasets (Kalberlah et al., 2002; Vermeire et al., 2001; Pieters et al., 1998). The Fraunhofer Institute ITEM has developed the database RepDose on subacute to chronic toxicity studies in rodents. The high quality and amount of data in RepDose allows to reevaluate the current extrapolation factors for rats and mice and for time-extrapolation. A tiered approach is applied to evaluate both assessment factors distinguishing oral and inhalation exposure. Based on allometric considerations, for <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>properties</b> a factor of 7 is proposed by the guidance to extrapolate doses as mg/kg bw from mice to humans and a factor of 4 for rats. Thus an extrapolation factor of 1. 75 would account for differences between rats and mice. Further according to the guidance a factor of 2. 5 is applied to account for toxicodynamic differences between species. The data in RepDose show, that on average the differences between both species are smaller than the standard extrapolation factor. Assessment factors for time-extrapolation are derived for subchronic to chronic, subacute to chronic and subacute to subchronic exposure. For the chemicals covered in RepDose, in general lower time-extrapolation factors are derived compared to those proposed by the REACH guidance document. The impact of local effects and certain physical-chemical properties like accumulation is described...|$|R
40|$|Manganese (Mn) {{exposure}} {{is a growing}} public health concern as new evidence continues to show that high level exposure to this essential metal is toxic. Chiefly toxic to {{the central nervous system}}, it produces signs and symptoms resembling, but not identical to idiopathic Parkinson’s disease. The hypothesis tested in this dissertation is that Mn accumulation in body tissues produces subclinical changes in the central nervous system altering neuronal repair mechanisms and leading to neurodegenerative damage. The studies in this dissertation evaluated the extent of these changes in the central nervous system. Changes in the <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>properties</b> of Mn in bone affecting the parameters of accumulation, distribution, and elimination were also identified. Importantly, the half-life of Mn in bone was estimated to be approximately 8. 6 years in humans, a finding which will be essential in developing a biomonitoring system for Mn exposure. Significant accumulation of Mn in brain and body tissues was observed along with significant metal dyshomeostasis following Mn exposure. Several brain regions had altered neurochemistry, and as a consequence, impaired motor function was observed. The subventricular zone (SVZ), one of two neurogenic niches in the adult brain, had the largest magnitude of change. Therefore, effects of Mn exposure on cell proliferation and differentiation in this region were investigated further. The processes involved in adult neurogenesis were significantly altered following Mn exposure, particularly with regard to cell proliferation. The full extent of the consequences resulting from Mn exposure in the pathology of neurodegenerative disease remains unknown, but the results of these studies demonstrate that although Mn exposure undoubtedly leads to several changes observed early in neurodegenerative disease pathology, no overt neurodegeneration was observed. The results of this work will help researchers studying the effect of metal exposure on adult neurogenesis and will also help researchers studying neurodegenerative disease and other disorders of the central nervous system. ...|$|R
40|$|Short-chain mono-alkylphenols {{provide an}} example of where a category-approach to {{read-across}} {{may be used to}} estimate the repeated-dose endpoint for a number of derivatives. Specifically, the NOAELs of 50 mg/kg bw/d for mono-methylphenols based on a LOAEL of very low systemic toxicity can be read across with confidence to untested mono-alkylphenols in the category. These simple alkylphenols are non-reactive and exhibit an unspecific, reversible polar narcosis mode of toxic action. Briefly, polar narcotics act via unspecific, reversible interactions with biological membranes {{in a manner similar to}} cataleptic anaesthetics. The read-across premise includes rapid and complete absorption via the gastrointestinal tract, distribution in the circulatory system, first-pass Phase 2 metabolism in the liver, and elimination of sulphates and glucuronides in the urine. Thus, toxicokinetic parameters are considered to be similar and have the same toxicological significance. Five analogues have high quality experimental oral repeated-dose toxicity data (i. e., OECD TG 408 or OECD TG 422). These repeated-dose toxicity test results exhibit qualitative consistency in symptoms. Typical findings include decreased body weight and slightly increased liver and kidney weights which are generally without concurrent histopathological effects. The sub-chronic findings are quantitatively consistent with the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of ≥ 50 mg/kg bw/d. Chemical similarity between the analogues is readily defined, and data uncertainty associated with the similarities in <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>properties,</b> as well as toxicodynamic properties, are low. Uncertainty associated with mechanistic relevance and completeness of the read-across is low-to-moderate, largely because there is no adverse outcome pathway or intermediate event data. Uncertainty associated with mechanistic relevance and completeness of the read-across is reduced by the concordance of in vivo, in vitro, USEPA toxicity forecaster (ToxCast) results, as well as the in silico data. The rat oral repeated-dose NOAEL values for the source substances can be read across to fill the data gaps of the untested analogues in this category with uncertainty deemed equivalent to results from a TG 408 assessment...|$|R
40|$|The aim {{of present}} study was to reveal the <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>properties</b> and {{absolute}} oral bioavailability of deoxynivalenol (DON) in turkey poults. Six turkey poults were administered this Fusarium mycotoxin per os and intravenously in a two-way cross-over design. Based on non-compartmental analysis, DON was absorbed rapidly (Tmax = 0. 57 h) but incomplete, as the oral bioavailability was only 20. 9 %. Deoxynivalenol was rapidly eliminated as well, both after oral (T 1 / 2 elimination PO = 0. 86 h) as well as intravenous (T 1 / 2 elimination IV = 0. 62 h) administration. Furthermore, semi-quantitative analysis using high-resolution mass spectrometry revealed that DON- 3 α-sulfate is the major metabolite of DON in turkeys after intravenous as well as oral administration, with DON- 3 α-sulfate/DON ratios between 1. 3 - 12. 6 and 32. 4 - 140. 8 after intravenous and oral administration, respectively. Glucuronidation of DON to DON- 3 α-glucuronide is a minor pathway in turkey poults, with DON- 3 α-glucuronide/DON ratios between 0. 009 - 0. 065 and 0. 020 - 0. 481 after intravenous and oral administration, respectively. Only trace amounts of other metabolites were found including 10 -DON-sulfonate, de-epoxydeoxynivalenol and 10 -de-epoxydeoxynivalenol-sulfonate. In addition, a similar two-way cross-over study was performed in three broiler chickens, in order to compare the biotransformation of DON in both poultry species. High-resolution mass spectrometry revealed that DON- 3 α-sulfate was the major metabolite of DON in broiler chickens as well, with DON- 3 α-sulfate/DON ratios between 243 - 453 and 1365 - 29624 after intravenous and oral administration, respectively. These ratios indicate that broiler chickens metabolize DON even more extensively to the sulfate conjugate compared to turkey poults. Only trace amounts of other metabolites were detected in broiler chickens. In conclusion it can be stated that the toxicokinetic behavior of DON in broiler chickens and turkey poults is comparable (low absolute oral bioavailability, rapid absorption and elimination, extensive biotransformation to DON- 3 α-sulfate), however, relative differences in DON- 3 α-sulfate/DON ratios exist between both species which might explain the hypothesized difference in sensitivity of both poultry species to DON...|$|R
30|$|The use of {{different}} cell lines and different methods for measuring cytotoxicity {{raises the question}} how much technical variations influence the outcome of in vitro cytotoxicity assays. Generally, {{there appears to be}} a good correlation between the different methods and cell lines. For instance, Saito et al. [118] found for the goldfish GFS cell line a high correlation of cytotoxicity results obtained with the lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity method and the MTT staining. Tan et al. [140] compared two methods for measuring cytotoxicity—MTT and the protein dye Coomassie Blue—and found high similarity between the two methods as well. Caminada et al. [29] compared the cytotoxicity of pharmaceuticals in the fish cell lines PLHC- 1 and RTG- 2, and found that for most compounds PLHC- 1 was slightly more sensitive than RTG- 2, but the differences were within an order of magnitude. In a study on nanoparticle cytotoxicity, Connolly et al. [40] found no significant differences between the results from fish cell lines and fish primary hepatocytes. The agreement of in vitro cytotoxicity data extends even from fish to mammalian cells, as reported by Castano and Gómez-Lechón [33] who observed a good correlation of IC 50 values (half maximal inhibitory concentration of the chemical; r[*]=[*] 0.915) between fish and mammalian cell lines. These results are corroborated by the results of the MEIC study [36, 37], which compared growth and viability endpoints for 50 chemicals in more than 60 in vitro systems from animals and humans. They found a “remarkable similarity of all toxicity data” [36 – 38], irrespective of the choice of the endpoint or cell system. This similarity is because basal cytotoxicity, as it was measured in the assays of the MEIC study, arises from chemical interference with fundamental cellular features that are common to all cells and, therefore, should not show cell type specificity. However, exceptions from the generality of the basal cytotoxicity concept must not be overlooked. For instance, Segner [125], when performing a principal component analysis of the cytotoxicity of six chlorophenols to six fish cell lines, found that five cell lines grouped closely together whereas the PLHC- 1 cell line displayed a dissimilar behaviour. Differences in <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>properties,</b> i.e. cell-specific biotransformation, can contribute to different cytotoxicity outcomes between cell systems [36]. Also cell type-specific vulnerabilities of the membrane integrity or energy metabolism may lead to deviations from the expectations of the cytotoxicity concept [80, 133]. Last but not least, the choice of the cell system makes a difference if it comes to the study of specific modes of action [110].|$|R
40|$|The {{toxicokinetics}} of inhaled compounds {{is defined}} by exposure, absorption of the material and its local metabolites, the tissue–plasma concentration–time curve, distribution within the body, and overall metabolism and excretion. Under controlled conditions of animal studies and human clinical trials, total exposures and estimated doses of individual compounds or simple mixtures of aerosols, gases and PM can readily be defined. However, methods for defining the <b>toxicokinetic</b> and toxicodynamic <b>properties</b> of mixtures at this time are ill {{equipped to deal with}} exposures to atmospheres that contain thousands of individual components at varying concentrations. In general, {{attempts have been made to}} model and define empirically the disposition of only very simple mixtures. For example, the most complex of toxicokinetic data and models generated have been with refined gasoline and seven to eight primary chemical components (Dennison et al., 2003, 2004). The caveat to these studies is that, unlike the variety of chemical components that are contained within combustion-derived materials, many liquid- and vapour-phase gasoline components have similar structure and generally similar pathways of absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) is a {{conceptual}} construct that describes existing knowledge on {{the link between}} a molecular initiating event and an adverse outcome. A sequential chain of causally related events is portrayed {{at different levels of}} biological organisation. AOPs are considered to be useful mechanistic blueprints for the development of novel tools for human and environmental risk assessment. Following OECD guidance, an increasing number of AOPs for chemically-induced adverse effects in humans and environmental species are being proposed. Due to their unique properties, the toxicity of nanomaterials (NMs) and chemicals is often difficult to directly compare since their mechanisms usually differ. While there are still many knowledge gaps in our understanding of NM toxicity, an ever increasing number of mechanistic studies are shedding light on their <b>toxicokinetic</b> and toxicodynamic <b>properties.</b> In this paper, we introduce the concept of AOPs and analyse its possible implementation for nanotoxicology. We illustrate how the AOP framework can be used to rationally combine mechanistic knowledge relating to both NM- and chemically-induced liver toxicity to fill information gaps and guide the development of toxicity testing strategies. The differences between NM and chemically-induced adversity are proposed to be primarily related to differences in toxicokinetics {{and the nature of the}} initial Key Events in the AOP. Consequently, much of the mechanistic knowledge captured by AOPs that have been developed from consideration of chemically-induced toxicity is also relevant to describe AOPs applicable to NMs, at least in qualitative terms, and thus can be used to inform predictive modelling and risk assessment of NM toxicity...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{environmental}} pollutants on honeybee behaviour has focused mainly on currently used pesticides. However, honeybees are also exposed to {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs). The aim of this laboratory based {{study was to determine}} if exposure to sublethal field-relevant concentrations of POPs altered the spontaneous behaviour of foraging-age worker honeybees. Honeybees (Apis mellifera) were orally exposed to either a sublethal concentration of the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture Aroclor 1254 (100 [*]ng/ml), the organochlorine insecticide lindane (2. 91 [*]ng/ml) or vehicle (0. 01 % DMSO, 0. 00015 % ethanol in 1 M sucrose) for 1 – 4 days. The frequency of single event behaviours and the time engaged in one of four behavioural states (walking, flying, upside down and stationary) were monitored for 15 [*]min after 1, 2, 3 and 4 days exposure. Exposure to Aroclor 1254 but not lindane increased the frequency and time engaged in honeybee motor activity behaviours in comparison to vehicle. The Aroclor 1254 —induced hyperactivity was evident after 1 day of exposure and persisted with repeated daily exposure. In contrast, 1 day of exposure to lindane elicited abdominal spasms and increased the frequency of grooming behaviours in comparison to vehicle exposure. After 4 days of exposure, abdominal spasms and increased grooming behaviours were also evident in honeybees exposed to Aroclor 1254. These data demonstrate that POPs can induce distinct behavioural patterns, indicating different <b>toxicokinetic</b> and toxicodynamic <b>properties.</b> The changes in spontaneous behaviour, particularly the PCB-induced chronic hyperactivity and the associated energy demands, may have implications for colony health...|$|R
