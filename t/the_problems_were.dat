5|$|Soon after Bloomberg's {{ceremonial}} ride, {{the opening}} {{date of the}} subway extension was pushed back from June to early fall 2014, then to November 2014, then to February 2015, and then to May 2015.

5|$|Christie {{urged the}} Navy Department to {{allocate}} a target ship for extensive field {{tests of the}} torpedo and exploder. The Chief of Naval Operations authorized {{the use of the}} obsolete destroyer , but placed so many restrictions on its use, Newport was forced to decline the offer. As a result, neither the Mark 6 exploder nor the Mark 14 torpedo ever underwent a live test, and their shortcomings would not become apparent until the outbreak of hostilities. It would be twenty months before <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> corrected, over Christie's objections.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, a {{time when}} federal aid for urban renewal was plentiful, Albany did not have growth in its economy or infrastructure. It lost more than 20 percent of its {{population}} during the Corning years, as people moved to newer housing in the suburbs, followed {{by most of the}} downtown businesses moving there as well. While cities across the country grappled with similar issues, <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> magnified in Albany: interference from the Democratic political machine hindered progress considerably.|$|E
50|$|If P0, &hellip; Pm are all {{positive}} semidefinite, then <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> convex.

50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> linear we can {{use some}} type of matrix inverse method—often <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> ill-posed or {{unstable}} so {{we will need to}} regularize it: good, simple methods include the normal equation or singular value decomposition.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> only transient, however, and by {{the time}} 1984 had come to a close, Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil was a success. Having only $60,000 left in the bank, Laliberté went back to the Canadian {{government}} to secure funding for a second year. While the Canadian federal government was enthusiastic, the Quebec provincial government was resistant to the idea. It was not until Quebec's premier, René Lévesque, intervened on their behalf that the provincial government relented. The original big top tent that was used during the 1984 Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil tour can now be seen at Carnivàle Lune Bleue, a 1930s-style carnival that is home to the Cirque Maroc acrobats.|$|E
5|$|Buckingham Palace finally {{became the}} {{principal}} royal residence in 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoria, {{who was the}} first monarch to reside there; her predecessor WilliamIV had died before its completion. While the state rooms were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. For one thing, it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down, and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence. Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when it was decided to install gas lamps, there was a serious worry about the build-up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty. Following the Queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, Prince Albert, concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace. <b>The</b> <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> all rectified by the close of 1840. However, the builders were to return within the decade.|$|E
5|$|Capcom auditioned {{actors to}} be used as {{references}} by the character designers. The faces of the main protagonists were shaped and based on real people, while motion capture was used to animate their models. About 60 percent of the characters' motions were animated based on the captured data, while the rest was created from scratch. The developers initially struggled to develop a system for computer graphic animation. However, Nintendo provided Capcom with assistance and <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> eventually solved. Capcom also hired new voice actors and rewrote the game's script to make the plot more convincing. The game was developed over the course of one year and two months. Final development of the game was very intense, as programmers had to work for two straight months with no days off to meet the proposed deadline. Resident Evil was released in March 2002 in Japan, April 2002 in North America, and September 2002 in Europe.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} three general {{problems}} concerning construction of evolutionary trees are considered. Algorithms for <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> presented and <b>the</b> complexity of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> investigated. <b>The</b> thesis {{consists of three}} corresponding parts. The first part <b>is</b> devoted to <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of constructing evolutionary trees in the experiment model. Different algorithms for <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>are</b> given, including an optimal algorithm for constructing evolutionary trees and an optimal algorithm for merging two evolutionary trees. Matching lower bounds are also provided. The {{second part of the}} thesis presents results related to the inferred consensus tree <b>problem.</b> <b>The</b> optimization version of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> shown to be NP-complete and two heuristic algorithms are presented. Further, the ordered version of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> studied. In <b>the</b> last part of the thesis the complexity of the maximum homeomorphic subtree <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> examined. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> shown to be hard to approximate, unless P=NP, even for trees of constant height, whereas a constant approximation ratio is obtained in case of a constant number of trees of constant height...|$|R
5|$|Force H was {{recalled}} to the United Kingdom in January and Argus loaded 12 Swordfish of 812 Squadron {{for her own}} protection. Whilst in the United Kingdom, she loaded some Supermarine Spitfire {{fighters and}} returned to Gibraltar on 24 February. There, the ship transferred the Spitfires to Eagle and embarked nine Fairey Fulmar fighters of 807 Squadron. The plan for Operation Spotter I was for Argus to provide fighter cover for Eagle as she flew off the Spitfires for Malta, but the operation had to be cancelled when the long-range fuel tanks of the Spitfires proved defective. <b>The</b> <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> not rectified until 7 March, when the 15 Spitfires were successfully flown off. During Operation Picket I, nine more Spitfires were flown off by Eagle on 21 March whilst a dozen Sea Hurricane IIBs from 804 Squadron provided air cover from Argus. The two carriers repeated the delivery on 29 March when Eagle flew off seven more Spitfires whilst 807 Squadron provided air cover from Argus. The latter ship also carried six Albacores bound for Malta as well, but the weather deteriorated over Malta and their fly-off was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Strikes and {{industrial}} unrest were frequent {{in the aftermath}} of World War I, arising from discontent over poor conditions and the rise of militant labour organizations like the Communist Party of Australia and the Industrial Workers of the World. <b>The</b> <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> made worse in Australia due to the overlapping system of industrial courts that had evolved since Federation. Although federal arbitration was intended for industrial disputes that impacted upon multiple states or federal employees, courts had through several judgments greatly expanded the potential jurisdiction of federal arbitration, and the system had developed into a duality with both state and federal tribunals weighing into a wide range of industrial disputes. This was exploited by both unions and employers, who pursued matters in the courts they felt most likely to be favourable and switched between different jurisdictions to arrive at the best combination of state and federal conditions. Protracted disputes arose as employers and employees pursued disputes in different courts or refused to recognise the rulings of one in favour of the other. Billy Hughes and several of his predecessors had sought resolution to the problem through greater Commonwealth powers, but all referendums to expand Commonwealth industrial powers had failed at the ballot box.|$|E
