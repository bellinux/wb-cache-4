5|$|Albin {{performed}} various {{tasks in}} this period on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>papacy.</b> On 15 May 1253, Bishop Albin and Richard de Inverkeithing, Bishop of Dunkeld, were appointed to be papal mandatories, and instructed by <b>the</b> <b>papacy</b> to protect Bishop William de Bondington from being summoned to lay courts on account of matters concerning his bishopric.|$|E
5|$|In the 13th century mendicant orders—the Franciscans and the Dominicans—who swore vows {{of poverty}} and earned their living by begging, were {{approved}} by <b>the</b> <b>papacy.</b> Religious {{groups such as the}} Waldensians and the Humiliati also attempted to return to the life of early Christianity in the middle 12th and early 13th centuries, but they were condemned as heretical by <b>the</b> <b>papacy.</b> Others joined the Cathars, another heretical movement condemned by <b>the</b> <b>papacy.</b> In 1209, a crusade was preached against the Cathars, the Albigensian Crusade, which in combination with the medieval Inquisition, eliminated them.|$|E
5|$|Foliot {{was mainly}} {{a force for}} {{moderation}} in the quarrel between the king and the archbishop, urging restraint on Becket and curbing the king's attempts to impose the Constitutions more rigorously. Foliot's rhetoric against the archbishop was pointed and effective. Foliot also developed the novel legal filing of ad cautelam, which was an appeal to <b>the</b> <b>papacy</b> against any future action by the archbishop. Although Foliot's tactic of ad cautelam was ridiculed by his opponents, <b>the</b> <b>papacy</b> did not challenge the technique.|$|E
50|$|Historically, Protestants {{objected to}} <b>the</b> <b>papacy's</b> claim of {{temporal}} power over all secular governments, including territorial claims in Italy, <b>the</b> <b>papacy's</b> complex relationship with secular {{states such as}} the Roman and Byzantine Empires, and the autocratic character of the papal office. In Western Christianity these objections both contributed to and are products of the Protestant Reformation.|$|R

5|$|In 1266, {{conflict}} between the Hohenstaufen house and <b>the</b> <b>Papacy</b> led to Sicily's conquest by Charles I, Duke of Anjou. With the usurpation of the Sicilian throne from Conradin by Manfred of Sicily in 1258, the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>Papacy</b> and the Hohenstaufen had changed again. Instead of the boy Conradin, safely sequestered across the Alps, <b>the</b> <b>Papacy</b> now faced an able military leader who had greatly supported the Ghibelline cause {{at the battle of}} Montaperti in 1260. Accordingly, when negotiations broke down with Manfred in 1262, Pope Urban IV again took up the scheme of disseising the Hohenstaufen from the kingdom, and offered the crown to Charles of Anjou again. With Papal and Guelph support Charles descended into Italy and defeated Manfred at the battle of Benevento in 1266 and in 1268 Conradin at the battle of Taglicozzo.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 1366, Walter was {{commissioned}} by <b>the</b> <b>papacy</b> to authorise dispensation for the irregular marriage between John Stewart, Earl of Carrick (much later King Robert III) and Annabella Drummond.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{was not a}} {{religious}} man; he viewed <b>the</b> <b>papacy</b> {{as a means to}} consolidate his family's position. He appointed Alessandro as cardinal against accusations of nepotism, fathered a number of illegitimate children, and spent large sums of church money collecting art and antiquities. Around 1545 Charles took the political and military advantage, weakening Paul's hold on <b>the</b> <b>papacy.</b> Aware of the changing tides of influence, Titian abandoned the commission before completion, and for the next 100 years the painting languished unframed in a Farnese cellar.|$|E
50|$|Pope Pius XII {{supported}} this {{idea in the}} 1949 encyclical Redemptoris nostri cruciatus. It was proposed again during <b>the</b> <b>papacies</b> of John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul II and Benedict XVI.|$|R
5000|$|This was {{followed}} by the move of <b>the</b> Roman <b>papacy</b> to Avignon, France in 1305. Although the move had precedent, <b>the</b> Avignon <b>Papacy's</b> (1305-1377) image was damaged by accusations of corruption, favoritism toward the French, and even heresy. Indeed, Pope Clement VI who was criticized for his apparent extravagant lifestyle asserted that his [...] "predecessors {{did not know how to}} be Pope." [...] During the span of <b>the</b> Avignon <b>Papacy</b> all <b>the</b> popes and most Cardinals and curial officials were French. The reputation of <b>the</b> Avignon <b>Papacy</b> led many to question the absolute authority of the pope in governing the universal Catholic Church.|$|R

5|$|The French were {{initially}} opposed to Albani's election, but they quickly dropped {{their opposition to}} him. He was elected unanimously on 23 November 1700. He was unsure whether he should accept <b>the</b> <b>papacy</b> {{due to the fact}} that he had nephews who he suspected would be angry if he followed the bull on nepotism. He was eventually convinced to accept <b>the</b> <b>papacy</b> by theologians who told him that not accepting an unanimous election would not be following the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{revived the}} scheme of his predecessor, Baldwin of Forde, to found a church in Canterbury that would be secular and not monastic. He promised that the new foundation's canons {{would not be allowed}} to vote in archiepiscopal {{elections}} nor would the body of Saint Thomas Becket ever be moved to the new church, but the monks of his cathedral chapter were suspicious and appealed to <b>the</b> <b>papacy.</b> The dispute from the time of Baldwin of Forde flared up again, with <b>the</b> <b>papacy</b> supporting the monks and the king supporting the archbishop. Finally, Pope Innocent III ruled for the monks and ordered Walter to destroy what had been built.|$|E
5|$|Although Alcuin had scorn for Æthelhard for fleeing Canterbury, <b>the</b> <b>papacy</b> saw it differently. Pope Leo III praised Æthelhard for fleeing {{and refusing}} to submit to Eadberht, whom Leo {{compared}} to the later Roman emperor Julian the Apostate. There are indications, though, that the Kentish community considered electing another archbishop while Æthelhard was in exile.|$|E
50|$|The film also tackles <b>the</b> <b>papacy's</b> {{struggles with}} {{cleaning}} up the Vatican Bank of its corrupt financial policies as an international institution, starting with Benedict XVI's hindered investigations and ending in Francis' supposedly radical initial reforms.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} 698, {{pressure}} from Pope Sergius I, and no doubt <b>the</b> <b>papacy’s</b> geopolitical location of Grado led to the shift of Aquileia to readopt <b>the</b> Roman <b>papacy’s</b> orthodox. However, this further led to another conflict to arise whereas Aquileia and Grado, while now technically in communion belonged to two separate kingdoms, with Aquileia still being the center of Lombard rule in the North, and Grado, {{the vision of the}} Byzantium’s Imperial rule.|$|R
60|$|By the {{outrageous}} discrepancy between <b>the</b> <b>Papacy's</b> professed and actual aims it was fast becoming {{an object of}} execration, and it is Alexander's misfortune that, coming when he did, he has remained as the type of his class.|$|R
5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in Europe, {{the collapse of}} papal authority in the Papal Schism allowed the Scottish Crown to gain effective control of major ecclesiastical appointments within the kingdom. This de facto authority over appointments was formally recognised by <b>the</b> <b>Papacy</b> in 1487. This led to the placement of clients and relatives of the king in key positions, including James IV's illegitimate son Alexander, who was nominated as Archbishop of St. Andrews {{at the age of}} 11, intensifying royal influence and also opening the Church to accusations of venality and nepotism. James IV used his pilgrimages to Tain and Whithorn to help bring the respective regions of Ross and Galloway, which lay on the edges of the kingdom, under royal authority. Relationships between the Scottish Crown and <b>the</b> <b>Papacy</b> were generally good, with James IV receiving tokens of papal favour. In 1472 St Andrews became the first archbishopric in the Scottish church, to be followed by Glasgow in 1492.|$|E
5|$|As the Catholic Church {{holds that}} women cannot be validly ordained, {{women are not}} {{eligible}} for <b>the</b> <b>papacy.</b> Though the pope is the Bishop of Rome, he need not be of Italian background. , the three most recent conclaves have elected a Pole, a German, and an Argentinian.|$|E
5|$|Despite growing {{pressure}} for his deposition, Stigand continued {{to attend the}} royal court and to consecrate bishops, until in 1070 he was deposed by papal legates and imprisoned at Winchester. His intransigence towards <b>the</b> <b>papacy</b> was used as propaganda by Norman advocates of {{the view that the}} English church was backward and needed reform.|$|E
5000|$|Caspar Röist (13 July 1478 [...] - [...] 6 May 1527) was a Swiss papal {{official}} and commander of <b>the</b> <b>papacy's</b> Swiss Guard. He died whilst commanding {{it in its}} last stand during the sack of Rome in 1527.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the massive}} debts {{incurred}} during his pontificate greatly weakened his successors, who {{were unable to}} maintain <b>the</b> <b>papacy's</b> longstanding political and military influence in Europe. He was also involved in a controversy with Galileo and his theory on heliocentrism during his reign.|$|R
25|$|Political intrigue {{within the}} Church in the mid-14th century caused the Western Schism. During this forty-year period, two popes—one in Avignon {{and one in}} Rome—claimed rulership over the Church. Although the schism was {{eventually}} healed in 1417, <b>the</b> <b>papacy's</b> spiritual authority had suffered greatly.|$|R
5|$|Federico Altieri began {{seeking to}} secure {{election}} to <b>the</b> <b>papacy</b> for himself. He {{had sought to}} both have a public persona favourable to Leopold I, while also working to curry the favour of Louis XIV. The zelanti faction and Flavio Chigi opposed him, which was enough to stop his victory.|$|E
5|$|Following her husband's {{death in}} 1461, Catherine's role receded {{to that of}} queen dowager at the court of her stepson, King Stephen Tomašević. Two years later, forces of the Ottoman Empire led by Mehmed the Conqueror invaded Bosnia {{and put an end}} to the {{independent}} kingdom. Catherine's stepson was executed, while Sigismund and Catherine, her son and daughter by Thomas, were captured and taken to Constantinople, where they converted to Islam. Queen Catherine escaped, taking refuge in Dubrovnik and eventually settling in Rome, where she received a pension from <b>the</b> <b>papacy.</b> From Rome she strove to be reunited with her children. Her efforts to negotiate and offer a ransom proved futile. She died a Franciscan tertiary in Rome, having named <b>the</b> <b>papacy</b> guardians of Bosnia and her children heirs to the throne, should they ever return to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Haakon also {{attempted}} to strengthen his ties with <b>the</b> <b>papacy</b> by issuing a vow of crusade. In 1241 he however converted {{this into a}} vow of engaging in warfare against pagan peoples in the north {{in light of the}} Mongol invasion of Europe. When a group of Karelians ("Bjarmians") had been forced westwards by the Mongols, Haakon allowed them to stay in Malangen and had them Christianized—something that would please <b>the</b> <b>papacy.</b> Later, in 1248, Louis IX of France proposed (by Matthew Paris as messenger) to Haakon to join him for a crusade, with Haakon as commander of the fleet, but Haakon turned the offer down. While Haakon had been unsuccessful in gaining the recognition of Pope Gregory IX, he quickly gained the support from Pope Innocent IV who sought alliances in his struggle with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Haakon finally achieved royal recognition by Pope Innocent in 1246, and Cardinal William of Sabina was sent to Bergen and crowned Haakon in 1247.|$|E

50|$|Pius {{also made}} a {{proposal}} for Jerusalem to become an international city, either under the United Nations or a related organization.

5|$|In 1151, David again {{requested}} a pallium for the Archbishop of St Andrews. Cardinal John Paparo met David at his residence of Carlisle in September 1151. Tantalisingly for David, the Cardinal {{was on his}} way to Ireland with four pallia to create four new Irish archbishoprics. When the Cardinal returned to Carlisle, David made the request. In David's plan, the new archdiocese would include all the bishoprics in David's Scottish territory, as well as bishopric of Orkney and the bishopric of the Isles. Unfortunately for David, the Cardinal does not appear to have brought the issue up with <b>the</b> <b>papacy.</b> In the following year <b>the</b> <b>papacy</b> dealt David another blow by creating the archbishopric of Trondheim, a new Norwegian archbishopric embracing the bishoprics of the Isles and Orkney.|$|E
5|$|In 610 Laurence {{received}} {{letters from}} Pope Boniface IV, addressed {{to him as}} archbishop and Augustine's successor.

While in Rome Mellitus attended a synod, and brought the synodical decrees back with him to Laurence.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the secular politics that impacted them, papal elections during this period were marked by a strategy among elite families to acquire prestige and power. These strategies often played out over several generations through patronage and the accumulation of wealth, and bestowing favours on family members once an individual was elected to <b>the</b> <b>papacy</b> was expected.|$|E
50|$|The 14th {{century had}} also {{produced}} upheaval in the Roman Catholic Church with {{the resolution of}} the Western Schism {{in the early part of}} the century, the controversies surrounding <b>the</b> <b>papacies</b> of <b>the</b> Renaissance era and new pressures brought by the invasions of Christendom by the burgeoning Ottoman Empire.|$|R
