5|$|In 1943 French agents {{reported}} that the Germans were planning to mount an offensive against the United Kingdom that would involve the use of secret weapons resembling giant mortars sunk {{in the ground and}} served by rail links. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> abnormal activity at Mimoyecques were spotted by analysts at the Allied Central Interpretation Unit in September 1943, when aerial reconnaissance revealed that the Germans were building railway loops leading to the tunnels into the eastern and western sites. Further reconnaissance flights in October 1943 photographed large-scale activity around the tunnels.|$|E
5|$|In June 1838 Barry {{and colleagues}} {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} Britain to locate a supply of stone for the building, eventually choosing Magnesian Limestone from the Anston quarry of the Duke of Leeds. Work started on building the river frontage on 1 January 1839, and Barry's wife laid the foundation stone on 27 April 1840. The stone was badly quarried and handled, and with the polluted atmosphere in London {{it proved to be}} problematic, with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> deterioration showing in 1849, and extensive renovations required periodically.|$|E
5|$|Mitoxantrone therapy may be {{associated}} with immunosuppressive effects and liver damage; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related cardiac toxicity. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an echocardiogram and a complete blood count before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> heart damage, infection or liver dysfunction during therapy.|$|E

5|$|Osbert fitzHervey (died 1206) was an Anglo-Norman royal judge. Brother of Hubert Walter and Theobald Walter, Osbert served three {{kings of}} England {{and may have}} contributed to the legal {{treatise}} attributed to his uncle, Ranulf de Glanvill. Ralph of Coggeshall, a medieval writer, praised Osbert's knowledge of law, but condemned his acceptance of gifts from plaintiffs and defendants in legal cases. Osbert was one of a group of men who are considered <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> a professional judiciary in England.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{also helped}} with the {{creation}} of a more professional group of royal justices. Although the group, which included Simon of Pattishall, Ralph Foliot, Richard Barre, William de Warenne, Richard Herriard, and Walter's brother Osbert fitzHervey, had mostly already served as justices prior to Walter's term of office, it was Walter who used them extensively. It appears likely that Walter chose them for their ability, not for any familial ties to himself. This group of men replaced the previous system of using mostly local men, and are <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> a professional judiciary.|$|E
5|$|In {{partnership}} with the goddess Brìghde, the Cailleach {{is seen as a}} seasonal deity or spirit, ruling the winter months between Samhainn (1 November or first day of winter) and Bealltainn (1 May or first day of summer), while Brìghde rules the summer months between Bealltainn and Samhainn. Some interpretations have the Cailleach and Brìghde as two faces of the same goddess, while others describe the Cailleach as turning to stone on Bealltainn and reverting to humanoid form on Samhainn in time to rule over the winter months. Depending on local climate, the transfer of power between the winter goddess and the summer goddess is celebrated any time between Là Fhèill Brìghde (1 February) at the earliest, Latha na Cailliche (25 March), or Bealltainn (1 May) at the latest, and the local festivals marking the arrival of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> spring may be named after either the Cailleach or Brìghde.|$|E

5|$|The {{agricultural}} trade boom in Eastern Europe showed <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> {{the approaching}} {{crisis in the}} 1580s, when food prices stopped increasing. It {{was followed by a}} gradual decline in agricultural products prices, a price depression, initially present in Western Europe. The negative consequences of this process on folwark economies of the East had reached its culmination {{in the second half of}} the 17th century. Further economic aggravation resulted from Europe-wide devaluation of the currency around 1620, caused by the influx of silver from the Western Hemisphere. At that time however massive amounts of Polish grain were still exported through Danzig (Gdańsk). The Commonwealth nobility took a variety of steps to combat the crisis and keep up high production levels, burdening in particular the serfs with further heavy obligations. The nobles were also forcibly buying or taking over properties of the more affluent thus far peasant categories, a phenomenon especially pronounced from the mid 17th century.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> Meyerbeer {{breaking}} {{with the}} Italian traditions {{in which he}} had trained are in Il crociato in Egitto. Amongst other notable features of the opera were its lavish orchestral forces (extending to two onstage military bands in the final act). The grandiosity of the work reflected the need to make an impact on the sophisticated and technologically advanced stages of London and Paris, for which it was extensively rewritten. Meyerbeer's contribution was revealed at this stage to be the combination of Italian vocal lines, German orchestration and harmony, and the use of contemporary theatrical techniques, ideas which he carried forward in Robert and his later works. However Meyerbeer's background in the Italian operatic traditions can be clearly seen as late as 1859 in the 'mad scene' in Dinorah (the virtuoso aria Ombre légère).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> a {{rehabilitation}} were seen during Leonid Brezhnev's rule, when information {{about him was}} again allowed {{to be included in}} Soviet encyclopaedias. His connection, support and work in the Anti-Party Group was mentioned in encyclopaedias published in 1973 and 1974, but eventually disappeared altogether by the mid-to-late-1970s. Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko further rehabilitated Molotov; in 1984 Molotov was even allowed to seek membership in the Communist Party. A collection of interviews with Molotov from 1985 was published in 1994 by Felix Chuev as Molotov Remembers: Inside Kremlin Politics. In June 1986, Molotov was hospitalized in Kuntsevo hospital in Moscow and he died, during the rule of Mikhail Gorbachev, on 8 November 1986. During his long life Molotov suffered seven myocardial infarctions, but lived to 96 years and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> panic {{were seen}} {{when a group}} of {{passengers}} attempted to rush port-side lifeboat No.14 as it was being lowered with 40people aboard. Fifth Officer Lowe, {{who was in charge of}} the boat, fired three warning shots in the air to control the crowd without causing injuries. No.16 was lowered five minutes later. Among those aboard was stewardess Violet Jessop, who would repeat the experience four years later when she survived the sinking of one of Titanics sister ships, , in the First World War. Collapsible boat C was launched at 01:40 from a now largely deserted area of the deck, as most of those on deck had moved to the stern of the ship. It was aboard this boat that White Star chairman and managing director J. Bruce Ismay, Titanics most controversial survivor, made his escape from the ship, an act later condemned as cowardice.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatise}} Tractatus of Glanvill, {{which is}} traditionally attributed to Osbert's uncle Ranulf de Glanvill, {{and to which}} Osbert himself may have contributed, names only seven judges, including Osbert. He {{was one of a}} group of royal justices that included Simon of Pattishall, Ralph Foliot, Richard Barre, William de Warenne, and Richard Herriard, used by Hubert Walter, the Justiciar of England during Richard's reign, and chosen for their ability rather than any familial ties. This group replaced the previous system of using mostly local men, and represent <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> a professional judiciary. In 1194 Osbert was one of the collectors of the carucage in eastern England, along with Barre and de Warrene.|$|E
5|$|This {{same period}} of {{economic}} and political uncertainty, however, produced an unsurpassed literary flowering in England. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> a new literary movement had appeared {{at the end of the}} second decade of Elizabeth's reign, with John Lyly's Euphues and Edmund Spenser's The Shepheardes Calender in 1578. During the 1590s, some of the great names of English literature entered their maturity, including William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe. During this period and into the Jacobean era that followed, the English theatre reached its highest peaks. The notion of a great Elizabethan era depends largely on the builders, dramatists, poets, and musicians who were active during Elizabeth's reign. They owed little directly to the queen, who was never a major patron of the arts.|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{clinical}} presentations of malignant tumour metastases {{outside of the}} eye and orbit, were seen in four patients: a 52 -year-old man who was scheduled to have a surgical removal of an oesophageal carcinoma and who presented with retinal detachment, a 58 -year-old woman in whom retinopathy was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> a cervical carcinoma (cancer-associated retinopathy), a 71 -year-old {{man who had been}} treated for colon carcinoma and who presented with an orbital mass, and finally a 67 -year-old woman with an orbital mass as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> a Grawitz tumour.

5|$|For an {{hour after}} dawn on 13 August, there were few German tracks upon the plot tables in {{operations}} rooms, and none {{at all in the}} central and eastern Channel. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> concentration, however, came earlier than usual, for between 05:30 and 05:40 two formations of 30 or more aircraft were located in the Amiens area. For 30minutes, they remained over land, but at 06:10 they began moving inland. The Observer Corps and radar tracked them and guided the RAF units to intercept. Unaware of the German intent, the controllers directed three full Squadrons and detachments of three others were alerted by 06:15. No. 151 was protecting a convoy in the Thames, No. 111 was protecting RAF Hawkinge and No. 74 Squadron RAF was covering RAF Manston. Parts of No. 85, No. 43 and No. 238 Squadron RAF were also airborne near London. By 06:25, the German formations were well over the Channel. No. 238 was moved to cover their own base at RAF Warmwell. No. 257 Squadron RAF was also ordered to take off at 06:20 to patrol Canterbury. Not satisfied with the strength of the forces already airborne, controllers dispatched No. 601, 213, 64 and 87 Squadrons to intercept between 06:30 and 06:35. The first combats began at 06:30.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, the Dunstan Government {{stepped up}} its {{legislative}} efforts. Some bills, {{such as the one}} to remove the sodomy law and decriminalise male homosexuality, had been initially blocked by the Legislative Council. However, the bill to abolish capital punishment passed with ease, and the homosexuality law reforms eventually passed in September. Rape law was properly codified and defined as a crime within marriage {{for the first time in}} Australia. Shopping hours, previously the most restrictive in the nation, became the most open. Following a royal commission, Friday night shopping was introduced for the city and Thursday night shopping for the suburbs. The deposits on beverage containers was finally passed. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> Monarto's eventual failure began to appear: birth rates started dropping significantly, immigration slowed and the economy was stagnant. South Australia's robust population growth, previously the highest per capita among the states, came to an abrupt halt. However, state money continued to be poured into the Monarto project, despite the fact that the Whitlam government cut funding to $600,000 in 1975, while his Liberal successor Malcolm Fraser gave nothing at all the following year. However, by the time Monarto was eventually scrapped after Dunstan's departure, no less than $20 million had been used to buy land, plant trees and formulate development plans, and the failed project is often seen as Dunstan's greatest failure. In addition, the federal government removed subsidies for shipbuilding at Whyalla, forcing the operations to be scaled down.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{touched down}} at 6:18p.m. CST (00:18UTC) near Castleberry High School {{northwest}} of downtown Fort Worth. Initially, the tornado lacked a condensation funnel, and {{could only be}} visually identified as dust swirls near the ground beneath the rotating wall cloud aloft; the tornado maintained this appearance {{for the first five}} minutes of its lifespan, after which a condensation funnel eventually developed. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> damage occurred in the River Oaks area along Texas State Highway 183 where metal roof panels were stripped off of a vacant fast food restaurant. After crossing the highway, the tornado inflicted sporadic F0damage to an older residential area, breaking tree branches and causing some damage to outbuildings; a few chimneys were toppled off of homes. At the time, the tornado's damage path was only a few hundred feet wide. A roof of a home near Roberts Cut Off Road was partially removed, signifying the first instance of F1damage. Several large and rotted trees were uprooted by the tornado's strong winds as it moved through the area. The tornado then passed directly over Castleberry High School, causing significant damage to the school's field house. Tornadic debris—including rooftop air conditioning units, gravel, and other detached construction—was thrown by the tornado at the school's western façade, causing minor damage. Throughout River Oak, three homes sustained major damage while 51others experienced minor damage.|$|E

25|$|Another Early Neolithic {{mass grave}} {{was found at}} Herxheim, near Landau in the Rhineland-Palatinate. The site, unlike the mass burials at Talheim and Schletz, serves as proof of ritual {{cannibalism}} rather than of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> violence in Europe.|$|E

40|$|Cutaneous metastases of lung {{tumors are}} {{occurring}} in 1 - 12 % of cases. High prevalence {{of lung cancer}} {{increases the likelihood of}} finding these changes in clinical practice.
