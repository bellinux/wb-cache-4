2500|$|Upon landing, {{the crew}} {{were unable to}} shut down the No.1 engine, which had to be doused by {{emergency}} crews for three hours after landing until flameout was achieved. The pilots considered whether to evacuate the plane immediately after landing as fuel was leaking from the left wing onto the brakes, which were extremely hot from maximum braking. The SCC pilot, David Evans, noted in an interview, [...] "We’ve got a situation where there is fuel, hot brakes and an engine that we can’t shut down. And really the safest place was on board the aircraft until such time as things changed. So we had the cabin crew with an alert phase the whole time through ready to evacuate, open doors, inflate slides at any moment. As time went by, that danger abated and, thankfully, we were lucky enough <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>everybody</b> off very calmly and very methodically through one set of stairs." [...] The plane was on battery power and had to contend with only one VHF radio to coordinate emergency procedure with the local fire crew.|$|E

Water {{is a part of}} our lives in so many different ways: not just for survival activities of drinking or cooking, but also in the production of our food, in many industrial activities, and even as a carrier of our waste. And in India, as in many other densely populated and rapidly industrialising sub-tropical regions, water scarcity, water pollution and too much water (flooding) are all major societal challenges. Responding to these challenges properly requires understanding how water is the quintessential environmental public good, and what kind of public actions may be required...|$|R
