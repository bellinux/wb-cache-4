5|$|There {{are several}} folk {{tales of the}} Tylwyth Teg, the fairy people who {{inhabited}} the area and an invisible land in Cardigan Bay. One tells of a farmer from Aberdaron {{who was in the}} habit of stepping outside his house before retiring to bed. One night he was spoken to by a stranger, who asked why <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> was annoyed by him. <b>The</b> <b>farmer,</b> confused, asked what the stranger meant and was told to stand with one foot on the stranger's. This he did, and could see another house, just below his own, and that all the farm's slops went down the chimney of the invisible house. The stranger asked if <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> would move his door {{to the other side of}} the house, which <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> subsequently did, walling up the original door; from that day, the farmer's livestock flourished, and he became one of the most prosperous men in the area.|$|E
5|$|The central {{feature of}} the {{monument}} depicts the theme {{of a young man}} called from civil life to serve his nation in a time of need and it transforms the theme into a contemporary allegory. It captures the decisive moment as farmer is caught mid-transition, with his left hand still on the plow handle, and taking the sword with his right hand from Liberty. The details of <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> includes realistic work clothes, a yoked shirt with rolled sleeves and work trousers tucked into his boots. Liberty, identified by her Phrygian cap, stands just above <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> in classical robes with a breastplate, sandals and cloak. Her face is impassive as she bestows the sword upon <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> with her left hand while her right hand holds her pike.|$|E
5|$|European pioneer {{farmers in}} the prairies of North America, {{where there is no}} wood for construction, often made their first home in a dug-out cave in the side of a hill or ravine, with a {{covering}} over the entrance. When they had time, they would build a sod house. <b>The</b> <b>farmer</b> would use a plow to cut the sod into bricks , which were then piled up to form the walls.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of {{the study}} was to {{ascertain}} the extent of adoption of aquaculture technologies by <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> as well as constraints faced by them in adopting the aquaculture technologies. The study also explored its relationships with the selected characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>farmers.</b> In addition, an attempt was also made to determine some selected attributes of the technologies and their relationships with the adoption by <b>the</b> <b>farmers.</b> <b>The</b> study was conducted with <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> of 10 upazilas of greater Mymensingh district who were the beneficiaries of three NGOs viz. SARA, ORD, and GRAMAUS. There were 351, 241 and 249 beneficiaries under SARA, ORD and GRAMAUS, respectively who adopted the aquaculture technologies under DSAP. About 25 % farmers from each of the three NGOs were selected for the study. The total sample size was 212. Pre-designed and pre-tested interview schedules were used for collecting data from <b>the</b> <b>farmers.</b> Field data were collected from <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> during August-September, 2004. Pearson product moment correlation co-efficient were computed in order to explore the relationships of the selected characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> as well as selected attributes of technology with the adoption of aquaculture technologies by <b>the</b> <b>farmers.</b> <b>The</b> same statistical test was used to determine the relationships between the selected characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> and their constraints in adopting the aquaculture technologies...|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of the study was}} to find out the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) {{mediated}} extension service by <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> for increasing farm productivity. Six ICT centers were established during 2010 in 6 villages under working area of Bangladesh Agricultural University Extension Center (BAUEC) for supplying farm information to <b>the</b> <b>farmers.</b> Since then farm information has been provided to <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> by using ICT facilities. Motivation campaign was conducted among <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> of BAUEC about utility of ICT center. Data were collected by using structured questionnaire and check list from a randomly selected sample of 120 out of 900 farmers of BAUEC. One-fifth (20 percent) of <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> were highly aware about the role of ICT, 45. 8 percent having medium awareness while 34. 2 percent of <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> had low awareness about the role of ICT in dissemination of farm information. The initial response of <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> seems positive and encouraging since ICT is a new initiative in extension work. Majority (75 percent) of <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> considered <b>the</b> benefit/outcome of using ICT in agriculture as medium to high, while 25 percent of <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> opined <b>the</b> benefit as low. It was found that <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> using ICT in farming activities have increased 5. 91 percent of their farm productivity (rice production) in compare to immediate past year while farmers having no exposure to ICT have also increased 3. 90 percent of farm productivity. This can apparently be assumed that the ICT alone can contribute 2. 01 percent increase of farm productivity. The awareness of <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> was found to have positive significant correlation with benefit of using ICT in agriculture. Among the characteristics, level of education, training exposure and extension media contact of <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> were highly correlated with benefit of using ICT in farming. The other characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> had no significant relationships with their use of ICT in getting farm information. The majority of the respondents were young to middle aged while all of them have varying levels of literacy and average family size. Considering the farm size and annual income, large majority of <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> were resource-poor and having good amount of farming experience. <b>The</b> <b>farmers</b> mostly preferred local sources while professional sources were less preferred for getting farm information. <b>The</b> <b>farmers</b> were found to have poor involvement in various socio-cultural organizations while moderate extent of training exposure. The management of ICT centers and technical ‘know how’ of BAUEC extension personnel were the problems faced by <b>the</b> <b>farmers</b> in using ICT for useful farming information. Strengthening of monitoring and supervision of ICT centers and motivational campaign could minimize majority of the problems to a reasonable extent has been opined by <b>the</b> <b>farmers...</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1836, native Vermonter John Deere set {{out from}} Rutland, Vermont to Grand Detour, Illinois, founded by his friend and fellow Vermont native Leonard Andrus. The town lacked a local blacksmith, Deere's trade, and within two days Deere had a forge and new {{business}} established. In Vermont, Deere produced plows made from cast-iron and when he first arrived in Illinois he produced the same plows. Soil conditions in Illinois differ from those in Vermont. In Vermont the soil is sandy and falls easily away from the plow blade but in Illinois the soil is thicker and wetter; it stuck to the plow {{and had to be}} scraped off by <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> as he plowed.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to better {{conditions}} for <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> (by which Tillman always meant white males only), in 1884 he founded the Edgefield Agricultural Club. It died for lack of members. Undeterred, Tillman tried again in January 1885, beginning the Edgefield County Agricultural Society. Its membership also dwindled, but Tillman was elected one of three delegates to the August joint meeting of the state Grange and the state Agricultural and Mechanical Society at Bennettsville, and was invited {{to be one of}} the speakers.|$|E

5|$|One {{approach}} is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more probable. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about what precise probability any given evidence justifies putting on the general statement. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are subjective, or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.|$|E

5|$|A {{farmer and}} his son were {{ploughing}} a field on the Isle of Mull using a team of four horses beside Loch Freisa, but work stalled {{after one of the}} horses lost a shoe and was unable to continue. Noticing a horse grazing nearby they decided to try using it as a replacement. Once harnessed to the wooden plough the horse appeared to be familiar with the task, and initially worked steadily. As it began to work towards an area closest to the loch, it became restless and <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> gently used a whip to encourage the animal to continue. It reacted by immediately transforming into a gigantic boobrie, giving out a loud bellow and diving into the loch, pulling the plough and the other three horses with it. The frightened farmer {{and his son}} watched as the creature swam to the centre of the loch then dived underwater, taking the other horses and plough with it. Seven hours later there was still no sign of the three horses.|$|E
5|$|Balch's {{investigations}} into geomorphology and hydrology {{led to his}} decision {{to try to find}} the origins of the water that rose to the surface at Wookey Hole Caves, the source of the River Axe. In 1901, he led a team of miners and cavers to dig into Swildon's Hole, where he found the 'Forty Foot Pot' as well as chambers full of stalagmites. Despite the publicity around the find, Balch refused to disclose the location of the cave as he believed it was too dangerous for amateur explorers. <b>The</b> <b>farmer</b> who owned the land denied them entrance the following year, turning the valley into a fish farm, so the team headed upstream where they discovered Eastwater Cavern, one of Balch's personal favourites.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Siege is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game developed by Gas Powered Games {{and published by}} Microsoft Game Studios on April 5, 2002, for Microsoft Windows, and the following year for MacOS. Set in the pseudo-medieval kingdom of Ehb, the high fantasy game follows a young farmer and his companions as they journey to defeat an invading force. Initially only seeking to warn {{the nearby town of}} the invasion of a race of creatures named the Krug, <b>the</b> <b>farmer</b> and the companions that join him along the way are soon swept up in finding a way to defeat another race called the Seck, resurgent after being trapped for 300 years. Unlike other role-playing video games of the time, the world of Dungeon Siege does not have levels but is a single, continuous area without loading screens that the player journeys through, fighting hordes of enemies. Also, rather than setting character classes and manually controlling all of the characters in the group, the player controls their overall tactics and weapons and magic usage, which direct their character growth.|$|E

5|$|On 3 September 1993, a Coroner's inquest {{was held}} at Lowestoft, and the hoard was {{declared}} a treasure trove, meaning that it was deemed to have been hidden {{with the intention of}} being recovered at a later date. Under English common law, anything declared as such belongs to the Crown if no one claims title to it. However, at the time, the customary practice was to reward anyone who found and reported a treasure trove promptly with money equivalent to the market value of the treasure, with the money being provided by the national institution that wished to acquire the treasure. In November 1993, the Treasure Trove Reviewing Committee valued the hoard at £1.75 million (today £), which was paid to Lawes, as finder of the treasure. He shared his reward with <b>the</b> <b>farmer,</b> Peter Whatling. Three years later, the 1996 Treasure Act was enacted, which allowed for the finder, tenant and landowner to share in any reward.|$|E
