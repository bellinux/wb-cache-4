At CRYPTO 2009, Icart [5] introduced a deterministic function Fq → E(Fq) {{which can be}} computed efficiently, and allowed him and Coron [3] to define well-behaved hash functions with values in E(Fq).

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} anesthesia {{recovery and}} hemodynamic status in patients under thiopental infusion or halothane maintenance anesthesia undergoing ocular surgery. Methods: Fifty-nine voluntary patients undergoing ocular surgery in Farabi hospital were allocated {{to one of}} two maintenance anesthesia groups: inhaled halothane, 0. 8 to 1 per cent, (group I, n= 37) and thiopental infusion, 10 to 12 mg/kg/hour, (group II, n= 22). Hemodynamic parameters were recorded at the time of patient entrance to the operation room and at the 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 minutes following anesthesia. Anesthesia recovery variables were also compared between the two groups. Results: In group I, arterial blood pressure at 10 to 40 min and heart rate at 1 and 25 min after the administration of anesthetics were significantly lower when compared with group II (W- 2 = 25. 10, p= 0. 005).

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we develop a {{probabilistic}} microscale compartmental model {{and use it}} to study macroscale properties of axonal transport, the process by which intracellular cargo is moved in the axons of neurons. By directly modeling the smallest scale interactions, we can use recent microscopic experimental observations to infer all the parameters of the model. Then, using techniques from probability theory, we compute asymptotic limits of the stochastic behavior of individual motor-cargo complexes, while also characterizing both equilibrium and nonequilibrium ensemble behavior. We use these results in order to investigate three important biological questions: (1) How homogeneous are axons at stochastic equilibrium? (2) How quickly can axons return to stochastic equilibrium after large local perturbations? (3) How is our understanding of delivery time to a depleted target region changed by taking <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> cell <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view...|$|R

Finally, the point clusters are grouped according to their topological relationship and spatial proximity to form strokes for recovering the road map. Experimental results show that our algorithm is robust to noise and varied sampling rates. The generated road maps show high geometric accuracy...|$|R

Beck and his bandmates hammered out fourteen songs in fourteen days, although just twelve made it onto the album, 1998's Mutations. Beck decided on Nigel Godrich, producer for Radiohead's OK Computer the previous year, to be behind the boards for the project. Godrich was leaving the United States for England in a short time, {{which led to the}} album's quick production schedule—"No looking back, no doctoring anything". <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the record was to capture the performance of the musicians live, an uncharacteristic far-cry from the cut-and-paste aesthetic of Odelay.

The artist then sought to void his contracts with both record labels, and in turn the labels sued him for breach of contract.

500|$|Pollock {{returned}} to office as Mint Director in 1869. Although Pollock opposed redemption, Treasury Secretary George S. Boutwell did not, and a bill allowing for redemption of base-metal coins {{in lots of}} at least $20 {{was signed into law}} by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 3, 1871. By then, early versions of what became the Coinage Act of 1873 were being considered by Congress. This was a major piece of legislation that reformed the laws relating to the Mint. As introduced by Ohio Senator John Sherman on April 28, 1870, it included Linderman's proposal for the use of copper-nickel in the minor coins. The debate over the bill stretched over the next three years. The use of nickel was a sticking point for the legislation; some congressmen alleged that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the bill was to benefit Wharton. Between 1870 and 1872, different versions of the bill, with a larger three-cent piece, twice passed the House and once the Senate, but differences between the houses could not be reconciled. After the second House passage, in May 1872, the Senate Finance Committee struck the provisions for copper-nickel coinage. After a conference committee met, both houses passed a version that left the cent, three-cent nickel piece, and nickel unaltered, and it was signed by President Grant on February 12, 1873. The act eliminated the two-cent piece, silver three-cent piece, silver half dime and the standard silver dollar (the last denomination was reinstated in 1878). The three-cent piece was made legal tender to twenty-five cents, as were the other two base-metal coins, the cent and nickel (the surviving silver coins were legal tender to five dollars). Numismatic writer Breen deemed the decision to eliminate the silver three-cent piece and the half dime, which might directly compete with the two copper-nickel coins, a favor to Wharton. Carothers called the abolition of the silver three- and five-cent pieces [...] "a necessity if the 3 cent and 5 cent nickel pieces were to be continued after the revival of silver coinage".|$|E

[...] Franks was given advice from the charity DrugScope on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research, and she said she believed the scenes to be very realistic. She wanted the drugs storyline to help people, saying, [...] "If {{there are people who have}} a drugs problem, or an addiction problem of any kind really, they might watch something like this and it could trigger something in their mind that is relevant to them, or someone that they know. Hopefully it could make people think twice about carrying on with that, and perhaps look into getting some help. The organisation that we worked with, DrugScope, gives a lot of help and advice for people with drug addictions.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study are to assess pig farmers’ preference for highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) vaccine, and estimate the cost and benefit of PRRS vaccination in Vietnam. This study employed an integrated epidemiological and economic analysis which combined susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model, choice experiment (CE) and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) together. The result of SIR model showed the basic reproduction number (R 0) of PRRS transmission in this study is 1. 3, consequently, the optimal vaccination percentage is 26 %. The results of CE in this study indicate that Vietnam pig farmers are showing a high preference for the PRRS vaccine. However, their mean willingness to pay is lower than the potential cost of PRRS vaccine. It can be considered {{to be one of the}} reasons that the PRRS vaccination ratio is still low in Vietnam. The results of CBA specified from <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> society’s <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view (Social perspective), the benefits of PRRS vaccination are 2. 3 to 4. 5 times larger than the costs.
