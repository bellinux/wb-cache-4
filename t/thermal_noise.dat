NICMOS contained a heat sink of solid nitrogen to reduce the <b>thermal</b> <b>noise</b> from the instrument, but shortly after it was installed, an unexpected thermal expansion resulted in part of the heat sink coming into contact with an optical baffle. This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4.5 years to about 2 years.|$|E
5|$|From 1920 John Carson, {{also working}} for AT, {{began to develop}} a new way of looking at signals using the {{operational}} calculus of Heaviside which in essence is working in the frequency domain. This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel to invent many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished many of the old ideas. For instance the old telegraph engineers thought of the signal as being a single frequency and this idea persisted into the age of radio with some still believing that frequency modulation (FM) transmission could be achieved with a smaller bandwidth than the baseband signal right up until the publication of Carson's 1922 paper. Another advance concerned the nature of noise, Carson and Zobel (1923) treated noise as a random process with a continuous bandwidth, an idea that was well ahead of its time, and thus limited the amount of noise {{that it was possible to}} remove by filtering to that part of the noise spectrum which fell outside the passband. This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with wide-band FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry Nyquist whose <b>thermal</b> <b>noise</b> power formula is well known today.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We study {{transport}} {{properties of}} <b>thermal</b> shot <b>noise,</b> thermo power and thermal conductance through superconductor-ferromagnetic / 2 DEG junction under {{the effect of}} Fermi energy, number of open channels and excitation energy. <b>Thermal</b> shot <b>noise,</b> PT hermal {{is directly related to}} the conductance through the fluctuation- dissipation theorem; the model consists of a 2 DEG region inserted between two identical superconductor electrodes. Ferromagnetic strips are placed onto top of each superconductor/ 2 DEG junction and voltage applied across the model.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{analytical}} approach in obtaining the probability density function (pdf) of the random decision variable Y, formed at {{the output of}} power-cubic all-optical nonlinear preprocessor followed by the photodetector. Our approach {{can be used to}} accurately evaluate the performance of ultrafast pulse detection in the presence of Gaussian noise. Through rigorous Monte-Carlo simulation, the accuracy of widely used Gaussian approximation of decision variable Y is refuted. However, in this paper we show that the so called Log-Pearson type- 3 probability density function (LP 3 pdf) is an excellent representation for the decision variable Y. Three distinguishable parameters of the LP 3 pdf are obtained through analytical derivation of three moments of the decision variable Y. Furthermore, toward a more realistic model, in addition to ASE Gaussian noise, the effects of shot and <b>thermal</b> <b>noises</b> are also included. Finally, using the presented analytical approach, it is shown that power-cubic preprocessor outperforms its quadratic counterparts, i. e., Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) and Two Photon Absorption (TPA) devices, in high power regime where shot and <b>thermal</b> <b>noises</b> can be neglected...|$|R

25|$|Interferometric {{detectors}} {{are limited}} at high frequencies by shot noise, which occurs because the lasers produce photons randomly; one analogy is to rainfall—the rate of rainfall, like the laser intensity, is measurable, but the raindrops, like photons, fall at random times, causing fluctuations around the average value. This leads to noise at {{the output of}} the detector, much like radio static. In addition, for sufficiently high laser power, the random momentum transferred to the test masses by the laser photons shakes the mirrors, masking signals of low frequencies. <b>Thermal</b> <b>noise</b> (e.g., Brownian motion) is another limit to sensitivity. In addition to these 'stationary' (constant) noise sources, all ground-based detectors are also limited at low frequencies by seismic noise and other forms of environmental vibration, and other 'non-stationary' noise sources; creaks in mechanical structures, lightning or other large electrical disturbances, etc. may also create noise masking an event or may even imitate an event.
