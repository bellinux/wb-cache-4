30|$|<b>The</b> <b>producer</b> {{could follow}} {{analogous}} procedures. <b>The</b> <b>producer</b> will apply {{not only the}} risk pair AQLp and [1  − P(AQLp)] as would be traditional, but also the risk pair LTPDp and P(LTPDp) recognizing that <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> suffers from his own secondary risk even though by a lesser degree. For example, <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> could set [1  − P(AQLp)] to 1 % and P(LTPDp) 10 %.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>producer</b> {{will agree}} to deliver a film (based on an agreed script/cast/budget) to a {{distributor}} in respect of certain territories in consideration (inter alia) for payment of a [...] "minimum distribution guarantee" [...] payable at the point in time when <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> has delivered <b>the</b> completed film. <b>The</b> <b>producer</b> obviously requires such funds upfront to finance the film so <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> takes <b>the</b> signed distribution contract to a bank/financier and will effectively use it as collateral against a production loan. It is at this stage that the bank will require a completion bond to be executed {{to provide them with}} the required level of security against the risk of non-delivery by <b>the</b> <b>producer.</b> <b>The</b> parties to the completion bond agreement are typically <b>the</b> <b>producer,</b> <b>the</b> financier(s), the completion guarantor company and the distributor(s).|$|R

5|$|Although it {{was planned}} that some key {{scenes of the}} episode would be filmed without an {{audience}} {{in order to avoid}} leaks of plot spoilers, <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> decided not to worry about the issue and filmed it all in front of the live studio audience. <b>The</b> <b>producers</b> also instigated the rumor that multiple endings would be filmed; in fact, only one was planned and shot.|$|E
5|$|At {{the taping}} of the episode, {{the cast and}} crew passed around yearbooks, {{custom-made}} by the production staff, and signed them for each other. The cast gave <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> inscribed Cartier SA watches, while <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> gave the cast Neil Lane jewelry. As the sets were broken down, {{the cast and crew}} each got a chunk of the street outside Central Perk in a glass box as a keepsake.|$|E
5|$|During post-production, as <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> {{decided to}} change the film into a more serious horror film, they filmed {{numerous}} scenes for that purpose without {{the participation of the}} director. Among those scenes is the entire prologue of the astronauts in space and West waking up in a hospital--these are the only scenes in which Rebar's face is seen without makeup. Additionally, the film was extensively re-edited by <b>the</b> <b>producers.</b> Sachs criticized the acting in those re-shot scenes, as well as the change of tone they bring into the film along with the re-editing by <b>the</b> <b>producers.</b>|$|E

30|$|A {{producer}} {{must answer}} two questions: (1) will <b>the</b> <b>producer’s</b> goods contain credence qualities? and (2) will <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> seek certification? <b>The</b> <b>producer</b> of a credence good, like other producers, wants to maximize net benefits. In this model, <b>the</b> <b>producer’s</b> objective function {{is comprised of}} (1) the price received for the good, less (2) the cost of production and certification, plus (3) the “motivation benefit” of production, which is roughly an extrinsic or intrinsic reward from producing a good with certain qualities. <b>The</b> <b>producer</b> maximizes net benefit by choosing {{the quality of the}} good and whether or not to seek third-party certification.|$|R
5|$|In the episode, Bart and Tom watch The Ren & Stimpy Show. <b>The</b> <b>producers</b> {{contacted}} Nickelodeon to get {{authorization to}} use the two characters for that sequence. Nickelodeon was strict about what The Simpsons was allowed to do, and <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> {{were not allowed to}} have the savageness that they wanted. The Ren & Stimpy Shows animators offered to do the layouts of Ren and Stimpy for the episode.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Fox, Dominic Monaghan and Jorge Garcia {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Sawyer, who at the time {{was supposed to be a}} suit-wearing city con man, but the role was given to Josh Holloway. Garcia was the first actor <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> knew they were going to cast. While <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> thought Garcia was spectacular, they did not think he fit in the role of Sawyer, so they created the Hurley character for him instead. When Holloway auditioned for Sawyer, <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> liked his southern accent and the edge he brought to the character (Holloway reportedly forgot his lines and kicked a chair in frustration). <b>The</b> <b>producers</b> knew he did not suit the role, but thought he was very watchable, so they rewrote the role to suit him, making him more feral, Southern, but kept the same intelligence he originally had. After appearing in The Lord of the Rings, Dominic Monaghan was offered many fantasy-based roles, like elves and pixies. He was keen to portray a different role, so he wanted a contemporary part that had layers and an edge. Originally Charlie was an older rocker that has been a big hit in the 1980s but now had a heroin addiction. After <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> enjoyed Monaghan's audition of Sawyer, they decided to cast him as Charlie and rewrote the script to make Charlie a young has-been instead.|$|E
5|$|Megan Mullally was {{originally}} {{going to provide}} {{a voice in the}} film. According to Mullally, <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> were dissatisfied to learn that the voice of her character Karen Walker on the television show Will & Grace was not her natural speaking voice. <b>The</b> <b>producers</b> hired her anyway, and then strongly encouraged her to use her Karen Walker voice for the role. When Mullally refused, she was dismissed.|$|E
30|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{fabrication}} of the lot, but before expediting the {{lot to the}} consumer, an inspection should occur to verify its quality level p. The interest of <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> is to expedite lots with acceptable quality to assure customer satisfaction and future transactions. When an inspection by <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> results in rejected lots, the common practice is to apply universal 100 % inspection to the rejected lot still in the factory replacing all bad parts. From <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> point of view, the major worry is the probability of the rejection of good lots P(x > c/p ≤ AQLp), which are false positives FP known as producer risk, a false alarm calling <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> to action where action is not necessary. <b>The</b> <b>producer</b> priority is to avoid the rejection of good lots, and, consequently, the sampling plan includes relatively large c. Clearly, with c large, <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> judges some bad lots as conforming, but as emphasized above this error is less troublesome for <b>the</b> <b>producer.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Producer</b> of a serial(Jagathi Sreekumar) {{is killed}} during its shooting. The director(Mukesh) {{is accused of}} it as he is <b>the</b> <b>Producer's</b> Son-in-law.|$|R
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the show, <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> from WCW/Turner Broadcasting System made several changes to the format, {{including}} reducing the overall time by 40 minutes. This forced AAA to change the first three matches from the traditional best-of-three falls to a single fall. <b>The</b> <b>producers</b> also cut back on the elaborate entrances that AAA usually had for their major shows and did not allow AAA to have a dark match before the broadcast started to rev up the crowd. <b>The</b> <b>producers</b> also pushed to change the semi-main event to a singles match between El Hijo del Santo and Eddie Guerrero, but in the end, the match went on as originally planned and advertised.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>producers</b> {{originally}} intended to have Diamonds Are Forever re-create commercially successful aspects of Goldfinger, including hiring its director, Guy Hamilton. Peter R. Hunt, who had directed On Her Majesty's Secret Service and worked in all previous Bond films as editor, was invited before Hamilton, but due to involvement with another project could only work on the film if the production date was postponed, which <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> declined to do.|$|E
5|$|Though <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> {{knew that}} Macfayden {{would leave the}} series, {{they did not know}} when he would do so, and so the first two episodes were {{initially}} written without him. In either case, <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> created a new character, Adam Carter. In addition, the writers heavily researched the episodes; many of the story lines are based on truth. <b>The</b> <b>producers</b> also took information from advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The series was directed in five blocks of two episodes in each. Filming started in January 2004 and took place over six to seven months. Shooting took place almost entirely in London, England, with some scenes shot in a cross-English Channel ferry in the fifth episode.|$|E
5000|$|The film had {{a wrestling}} match between Dara Singh and King Kong. <b>The</b> <b>producer</b> said while <b>the</b> {{shooting}} {{of the match}} was in progress, he noticed blood oozing from King Kong's mouth. He was concerned and shouted, [...] "cut, cut". But the wrestler King Kong wanted the blood {{to be seen in}} the film. King Kong almost hit <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> but Dara Singh intervened and told him that he is <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> of <b>the</b> film, <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> reminisced in an interview later.|$|R
5000|$|... has {{supplied}} the product, where <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> cannot {{be identified and}} any attempt by the injured party to elicit <b>the</b> <b>producer's</b> identity is frustrated or ignored.|$|R
5000|$|When Kyle asks <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> why he {{is doing}} this, <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> {{explains}} that {{when he became a}} grandfather, one day he asked his grandson who his favorite celebrity was, and his grandson said it was PewDiePie. Bewildered that his grandson worshiped an insignificant Internet personality, and was unimpressed with anyone to whom he tried to introduce him, <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> says that with the television special, he will assimilate the younger generation's culture into his own. Stan is astonished that <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> is [...] "such a grandpa".|$|R
5|$|Troy McClure hosts a {{television}} special {{from the museum}} of TV and television introducing three spin-off productions, created using characters from The Simpsons. The Fox network only has three filled slots for the next season and so commissions <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> of The Simpsons to create thirty-five new shows. <b>The</b> <b>producers</b> instead decided to create just three new shows.|$|E
5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> knew Macfadyen would leave, <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> {{decided to}} {{introduce}} new cast members, {{one of which}} was Rupert Penry-Jones as Adam Carter, the new protagonist. Early on in the creation of Adam, <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> had an interest in casting Penry-Jones for the role; however, it took the actor three auditions until <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> finally decided to cast him. Unlike Tom, Adam would have a different character dynamic; he has an MI6 background, and is married. A change from the girlfriend/boyfriend storyline for Tom and Ellie Simm in the first series, <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> noted it is common for secret service officers to be in a relationship with others in the same field of work. This led to the introduction of Fiona Carter, portrayed by Olga Sosnovska. Sosnovska was previously approached to appear in the second series, but was unavailable. She later auditioned for Fiona, and was later told she won the part when she was in New York City. The actress was only given a brief on her character—a ball breaker, ultimate professional, cold and calculated—which did not give her much to work with. Sosnovska initially found Fiona irritating in the fourth episode, but later opened up to the character after her return in the seventh.|$|E
5|$|After Siskel's {{death in}} 1999, <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> retitled the show Roger Ebert & the Movies and used {{rotating}} co-hosts. In September 2000, Chicago Sun-Times columnist Richard Roeper became the permanent co-host {{and the show}} was renamed At The Movies With Ebert & Roeper and later At the Movies.|$|E

5|$|After {{allowing}} {{himself to}} be used by the casting director, Harry gets a small role as a cop in the film for which he had previously been rejected. On-set he impresses <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> and they offer him a part in a TV series.|$|E
5|$|After {{the series}} {{was picked up by}} HBO, <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> leased a {{building}} with a store front in Kearny, New Jersey. For the remainder of the production period, this building served as the shooting location for scenes outside and inside the pork store, now renamed Satriale's.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many of the}} first-season cast {{were set}} to return, <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> had {{a large number of}} new {{characters}} to cast for the second season. Due to this, Benioff and Weiss postponed the introduction of several key characters and merged several characters into one or assigned plot functions to different characters.|$|E

5000|$|In general, <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> is not <b>the</b> [...] "boss" [...] of {{the people}} on the game {{development}} team, but the [...] "boss" [...] of the game. So while a programmer may answer to a programming director, where matters of the game are involved, they answer to <b>the</b> <b>producer.</b> Producers may issue reprimands or issue accolades, but usually the fate of the developer's employment is not in the hands of <b>the</b> <b>producer.</b> So while they may suggest termination or promotions of certain employees, <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> normally cannot fire or promote team members single-handedly.|$|R
40|$|Legislation has {{prompted}} changes in milk price volatility. Milk price volatility impacts <b>the</b> <b>producer’s</b> exposure to business risk which is compound by the firms financial risk. Financial risk {{is a function}} of the firms capital structure. In the short run it is difficult for <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> to significantly change the firms capital structure and therefore balance increased business risk with reduced financial risk. <b>The</b> <b>producer</b> can however reduce financial and business risk by using futures contracts to lock in a price for milk produced. <b>The</b> <b>producer’s</b> risk preferences dictate <b>the</b> <b>producer’s</b> hedge ratio. Using the return on equity as a profitability measure and the conditional value at risk as a risk measure the optimal hedge ratio is derived for various probabilities of negative returns on equity...|$|R
