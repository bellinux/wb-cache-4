The paper finds: (1) Local <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> shortages raise the employment-population rate arid reduce the unemployment rate of disadvantaged youths by substantial amounts. (2) Shortages also raise the hourly earnings of disadvantaged youths. In the 19805 the earnings gains for youths in <b>tight</b> <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> offset the deterioration in the real and relative earnings of the less skilled that marked this decade.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years the United States has enjoyed the unique {{economic}} duet of very low unemployment and declining price inflation. For decades, we have come to associate <b>tight</b> <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> with accelerating wages and prices. But in 1997, the unemployment rate sank below 5 percent, and neither wage nor price inflation became a problem. Have our inflation processes fundamentally changed for the better? Are we in a new era of permanently better economic performance due to new behavior by our citizens? Or are we simply enjoying good luck in the form of positive supply shocks? A careful reading of the full inflation story reveals that nominal wage inflation has been subdued by exceptionally modest price inflation, according to the author. Real, or price-adjusted, wage inflation has been increasing in response to low unemployment, just as in past decades. Price inflation has been held down by a set of "supply shocks," including a strong dollar, falling energy prices, and a cost-reducing regime shift in the healthcare industry.

40|$|In this paper, I {{develop a}} simple model of spatial {{equilibrium}} to investigate theoretically what determines the sign {{and magnitude of}} ''local multipliers' (defined as elasticity of employment in the non-tradable sector with respect to increase in employment in the tradable sector). I estimate the local multiplier with data for France {{and focus on the}} heterogeneity of local multipliers across local <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> and across sectors. In order to cope with possible endogeneity issues, I use a shift-share instrument (Bartik, 1991), already used in the literature, and build another instrument based on trade-shocks (in the spirit of Autor et al. (2012) and referred to as ''import-per-worker' index (IPW) below). I find an average elasticity of 0. 36 (1. 25 job-to-job effect), a result considerably higher than previous studies of European economies and similar to previous findings with the US data (Moretti and Thulin, 2012). The two instruments give broadly comparable results. I find that the local multiplier is larger for local <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> with high initial unemployment rate. Similar results hold when using hours supplied instead of mere headcount, suggesting that ?tight' <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> fail to adjust through the intensive margin. On the other hand, when using overall payroll, the difference between slack and <b>tight</b> <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> cease to be significant. This suggests that increase in labor demand push up wages in <b>tight</b> <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> while the adjustment occurs purely through quantities purely in slack <b>labor</b> <b>markets.</b> Hence the incidence of shifts in local labor demand depends on initial <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> conditions. Finally, I find evidence of higher local job multipliers associated with high-tech sector and show that when estimating the local earning multiplier the difference becomes insignificant, suggesting that more intensive pecuniary externality drives that sectoral heterogeneity and not some sort of technological externality...|$|R
