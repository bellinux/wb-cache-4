5|$|In 1736, {{during the}} War of the Polish Succession, Don Carlos was banished from <b>Tuscany</b> {{as part of}} a {{territorial}} swap, and Francis III of Lorraine was made heir in his stead. In January 1737, the Spanish troops, who had occupied <b>Tuscany</b> since 1731, withdrew; 6,000 Austrian soldiers took their place.|$|E
5|$|Gian Gastone de' Medici, Grand Duke of <b>Tuscany</b> (1671-1737) married Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, no issue.|$|E
5|$|Grand Duke Cosimo III of <b>Tuscany</b> in 1688 sought Violante Beatrice as {{a prestigious}} bride — Bavaria {{was one of}} the most {{powerful}} states of the Holy Roman Empire — for his elder son and heir, Ferdinando, Grand Prince of <b>Tuscany.</b> As Cosimo's father, Ferdinando II, had embroiled Elector Ferdinand Maria in an abortive financial venture costing him 450,000 ungheri worth of gold, relations between Munich and Florence were sour.|$|E
5|$|He married Marguerite Louise d'Orléans, {{a cousin}} of LouisXIV. The {{marriage}} was solemnized by proxy in the King's Chapel at the Louvre, on Sunday, 17 April 1661. It was a marriage fraught with tribulation. Marguerite Louise eventually abandoned <b>Tuscany</b> for the Convent of Montmartre. Together, they had three children: Ferdinando in 1663, Anna Maria Luisa, Electress Palatine, in 1667, and Gian Gastone, the last Medicean ruler of <b>Tuscany,</b> in 1671.|$|E
5|$|In May 1716, the Emperor {{assured the}} Electress and the Grand Duke {{that there was}} no insurmountable {{obstacle}} preventing her accession, but that Austria and <b>Tuscany</b> must soon reach an agreement regarding which royal house which was to succeed the Medici. As an incentive to accelerate Cosimo's reply, the Emperor hinted that <b>Tuscany</b> would reap territorial advancements. In June 1717 Cosimo declared his wish that the House of Este should succeed. Charles VI's promises never materialised. In 1718 he repudiated Cosimo's decision, declaring a union between <b>Tuscany</b> and Modena (the Este lands) unacceptable. On 4 April 1718 England, France and the Dutch Republic (and later Austria) selected Don Carlos of Spain, the eldest child of Elisabeth Farnese and Philip V of Spain, as the Tuscan heir. By 1722 the Electress was not even acknowledged as heiress, and Cosimo was reduced to spectator at the conferences for Tuscany's future.|$|E
5|$|In later life, he {{attempted}} to have Anna Maria Luisa recognised as the universal heiress of <b>Tuscany,</b> but CharlesVI, Holy Roman Emperor, would not allow it because Florence was nominally an imperial fief, and he felt he alone could alter the Tuscan laws of succession. All Cosimo's efforts to salvage the plan foundered, and in 1737, upon his younger son's death, <b>Tuscany</b> passed to the House of Lorraine.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} is a simplified example of the fiscal cycle for the general fund of the City of <b>Tuscany,</b> a fictitious city government.|$|E
5|$|After meeting {{again on}} {{separate}} holidays in New York, they began dating and married in October 2001 {{in a ceremony}} in <b>Tuscany,</b> Italy. Ripley {{gave birth to the}} couple's first child, a daughter, in October 2002. She gave birth to a son in October 2006.|$|E
5|$|Carlos II of Spain died in November 1700. His death, {{without any}} {{ostensible}} heir, {{brought about the}} War of the Spanish Succession, which involved all of the European powers. <b>Tuscany,</b> however, remained neutral.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to further}} {{conflicts}} with imperial officials, Conrad had to flee in 1112 {{and was not}} able to return to Salzburg until 1121. While in exile, he lived in <b>Tuscany,</b> Admont in Styria, and Saxony.|$|E
5|$|Gian Gastone {{arrived in}} <b>Tuscany,</b> without his wife, in 1708. The Emperor, {{thinking}} {{it unlikely that}} any male heirs were to be born to the Medici, prepared to occupy <b>Tuscany,</b> under the pretext of Medici descent. He intimated that upon the Grand Prince's death the Tuscans would rebel against Cosimo's autocratic government. Cosimo, {{in an act of}} desperation, had Francesco Maria, the Medici family cardinal, renounce his religious vows and marry Eleanor of Gonzaga, the youngest child of the incumbent Duke of Guastalla. Two years later, Francesco Maria died, taking with him any hope of an heir.|$|E
5|$|In 1800, French First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte {{advanced}} into Italy, achieving victories {{against the}} Austrian Empire {{at the battle}} of Marengo. After a year of warfare, the French and Austrians signed the Treaty of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, which divided Northern Italy between the states and awarded the Grand Duchy of <b>Tuscany</b> to the French. Included in this division was the island of Elba in the Ligurian Sea off the Western Italian coast, which at that time was shared between <b>Tuscany</b> and the Kingdom of Naples. On 28 March 1801, the Treaty of Florence was signed between Naples and France, officially turning the entirety of Elba over to French control, although it had not yet been surrendered by its Neapolitan and Tuscan commanders.|$|E
5|$|In the Italian {{province}} of Massa and Carrara, {{located within the}} <b>Tuscany</b> region, it was a peasant food consumed as a one-course meal, topped with grated cheese and olive oil. In Massa and Carrara, it was sometimes accompanied with stracchino cheese or charcuterie. Testaroli remains a very popular dish in Pontremoli, a small city in the {{province of}} Massa and Carrara, where it is served at virtually every restaurant in the city, during both mornings and evenings. Testaroli is also a common and specialty dish in the Lunigiana region and historical territory of Italy, which is located between the Liguria and <b>Tuscany</b> regions.|$|E
5|$|Testaroli is {{sometimes}} served with pesto sauce, {{which is a}} common addition {{to it in the}} Liguria and <b>Tuscany</b> regions of Italy. Another dressing method includes the addition of olive oil, Pecorino cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, garlic and basil. Significant amounts of sauce may absorb into testaroli.|$|E
5|$|The palace {{was bought}} by the Medici family in 1549 and became the chief {{residence}} of the ruling families of the Grand Duchy of <b>Tuscany.</b> It grew as a great treasure house as later generations amassed paintings, plates, jewelry and luxurious possessions.|$|E
5|$|The {{race of the}} two seas {{began with}} a flat team time trial {{starting}} and ending in Marina di Carrara in <b>Tuscany</b> on the Tyrrhenian coast. The course cut inland briefly, but doubled back and ended less than a kilometer from where it started.|$|E
5|$|Villani also {{describes}} in vivid detail {{the effects of}} another widespread famine in <b>Tuscany</b> during the year 1347, which killed an estimated 4,000 people in Florence {{a year before the}} Bubonic Plague.|$|E
5|$|Violante Beatrice of Bavaria (Violante Beatrix; 23 January 167330 May 1731) was Grand Princess of <b>Tuscany</b> as {{the wife}} of Grand Prince Ferdinando of <b>Tuscany</b> and Governor of Siena from 1717 until her death. Born a Duchess of Bavaria, the {{youngest}} child of Elector Ferdinand Maria, she married {{the heir to the}} Tuscan throne, Ferdinando de' Medici, in 1689. Violante Beatrice loved him but Ferdinando did not return her affection, declaring her too ugly and too dull. Her brother-in-law, Prince Gian Gastone, befriended her out of sympathy, a friendship that lasted until Violante Beatrice's demise.|$|E
5|$|After the War of the Polish Succession {{broke out}} in 1733, Charles marched a Spanish army south and {{defeated}} the Austrians holding the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily. Pursuant to preliminary peace terms negotiated in 1735 (but not finalized until after Gian Gastone's death with the 1738 Treaty of Vienna), Charles surrendered Parma and the claim to the Tuscan throne to Francis III of Lorraine in exchange for being crowned king of Naples and Sicily. (Francis was forced to surrender Lorraine to Stanisław Leszczyński, the losing claimant to the Polish throne.) Neither the Grand Duke nor Francis III were consulted. The latter was reluctant to cede his homeland to France, but the Holy Roman Emperor (soon to be his father-in-law) compelled him. Gian Gastone was angry; he had become quite attached to the Infante-Duke, and didn't like {{the prospect of a}} foreigner ruling <b>Tuscany.</b> Spain accordingly withdrew its troops from <b>Tuscany</b> in January 1737; 6,000 Austrians took their place on Francis's behalf.|$|E
5|$|Cosimo III left a <b>Tuscany</b> one of {{the poorest}} nations in Europe; the {{treasury}} empty and the people weary of religious bigotry, the state itself was reduced to a gaming chip in European affairs. Among his enduring edicts is the establishment of the Chianti wine region. Gian Gastone repealed Cosimo's Jewish persecution laws, and eased tariffs and customs. Cosimo's inability to uphold Tuscany's independence led to the succession of the House of Lorraine upon Gian Gastone's death in 1737.|$|E
5|$|Cosimo de' Medici {{was born}} on 14 August 1642, the eldest {{surviving}} son of Vittoria della Rovere of Urbino, and Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of <b>Tuscany.</b> Their previous two children had died shortly after birth. Grand Duke Ferdinando wished to give his son the finest scientific education available, but the pious Grand Duchess Vittoria opposed. The latter got her way. Volunnio Bandinelli, a Sienese theologian, was appointed Cosimo's tutor. His character was analogous to the Grand Duchess's.|$|E
5|$|Despite her mother's {{efforts to}} induce a {{miscarriage}} {{by means of}} riding, Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici, the only daughter and second child of Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of <b>Tuscany,</b> and his consort, Marguerite Louise d'Orléans, was born in Florence on 11 August 1667. She was named after her maternal aunt Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of an extinct relative, Globicephala baereckeii, {{have been}} found in Pleistocene {{deposits}} in Florida. Another Globicephala dolphin was discovered in Pliocene strata in <b>Tuscany,</b> Italy, and was named G. eturia. The pilot whales were also close relatives of the extinct blunt-snouted dolphin. Close living relatives of the pilot whales are the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and Risso's dolphin.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{continued}} to receive visitors until 1642, when, after suffering fever and heart palpitations, {{he died on}} 8 January 1642, aged 77. The Grand Duke of <b>Tuscany,</b> Ferdinando II, wished to bury him in {{the main body of}} the Basilica of Santa Croce, next to the tombs of his father and other ancestors, and to erect a marble mausoleum in his honour.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, former presenters Katy Hill and Trey Farley, who had {{presented}} the show together in Series 8, {{went on to}} marry each other at a register office in Surrey before flying to <b>Tuscany</b> to seal their marriage. They later had two children together- a daughter called 'Kaya Skye' born in 2006 and a son called 'Akira' born in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In June 1717, Cosimo {{declared}} his {{wish that the}} House of Este should succeed the Electress. Charles VI had previously offered the Grand Duke territorial compensation—in {{the form of the}} State of Presidi—if he chose quickly, but reneged. In 1718, Charles VI repudiated Cosimo's decision, declaring a union of <b>Tuscany</b> and Modena (the Este lands) unacceptable. Hereafter, a stalemate existed between them.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{with the}} Portuguese were intense, but stalled over certain clauses: Ferdinando and Isabel Luisa {{would live in}} Lisbon, Ferdinando would renounce his right to the Tuscan throne unless the Infanta's father, King Peter II, {{remarried}} and had male issue, and if Isabel Luisa became Queen of Portugal, and Cosimo III, Gian Gastone and Francesco Maria died without any male heirs, <b>Tuscany</b> would be annexed by Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Potamon fluviatile {{is widely}} {{distributed}} {{in much of}} mainland Italy, especially in the provinces of Trento, Lombardy, Veneto, Liguria, <b>Tuscany,</b> Umbria, Lazio, Campania, Apulia, and Calabria, {{as well as on}} the island of Sicily. Although it used to be found as far north as Lake Garda, P.fluviatile no longer occurs north of the River Po.|$|E
5|$|She also {{begins a}} brief power {{struggle}} with freshman Jenny Humphrey. After she unites with Chuck and Nate {{in order to}} save Serena from the scheming Georgina Sparks, Chuck realizes that his feelings for Blair are real and suggests that they spend the summer together in <b>Tuscany.</b> However, he is discouraged by his father at the last minute, and stands Blair up.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Prince finally {{succumbed to}} {{syphilis}} on 30 October 1713, sparking a succession crisis. Cosimo III deposited {{a bill in}} the Tuscan senate, the nominal legislature, provisioning for a male line succession failure by making the Electress Palatine Gian Gastone's heiress. It passed and was disseminated to chancelleries across Europe. Austria refused to sanction it, fearing that <b>Tuscany</b> would fall into the Bourbons' hands. However, France and England did.|$|E
5|$|The fiscal cycle {{begins with}} the {{approval}} of a budget by the mayor and city council of the City of <b>Tuscany.</b> For Fiscal Year 2009, which began on July 1, 2008, the Mayor's Office estimated general fund revenues of $35 million from property taxes, state grants, parking fines and other sources. The estimate was recorded in the fund's general ledger with a debit to Estimated Revenues and a credit to Fund Balance.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} was unhappy from the start. A few nights following the formal entry, Marguerite Louise demanded the Tuscan crown jewels {{for her own}} personal use; Cosimo refused. The jewels that she did manage to extract from Cosimo were almost smuggled out of <b>Tuscany</b> by her attendants but for the efforts of Ferdinando's agents.|$|E
5|$|The {{trade in}} New England ice {{expanded}} during the 1830s and 1840s across the eastern {{coast of the}} U.S., while new trade routes were created across the world. The first and most profitable of these new routes was to India: in 1833 Tudor combined with the businessmen Samuel Austin and William Rogers to attempt to export ice to Calcutta using the brigantine ship the <b>Tuscany.</b> The Anglo-Indian elite, concerned {{about the effects of}} the summer heat, quickly agreed to exempt the imports from the usual East India Company regulations and trade tariffs, and the initial net shipment of around a hundred tons (90,000kg) sold successfully. With the ice fetching for three pence (£0.80 in 2010 terms) per pound (0.5kg), the first shipment aboard the <b>Tuscany</b> produced profits of $9,900 ($253,000), and in 1835 Tudor commenced regular exports to Calcutta, Madras and Bombay.|$|E
5|$|Villani was {{inspired}} to write his Cronica after attending the jubilee celebration in Rome in 1300 and noting the venerable history of that city. He outlined the events in his Cronica year for year, following a strictly linear narrative format. He provided intricate details on many important historical events {{of the city of}} Florence and the wider region of <b>Tuscany,</b> such as construction projects, floods, fires, famines, and plagues.|$|E
5|$|Violante Beatrice of Bavaria, to whom Gian Gastone {{had become}} quite attached, disliked the Electress and {{therefore}} left the grand ducal {{court for the}} position of governor {{of the town of}} Siena. The Electress, now the First Lady of <b>Tuscany,</b> and Gian Gastone were not on good terms: he scorned her for marrying him to Anna Maria Franziska, who, for eleven years, made his life unbearable.|$|E
5|$|After {{gathering}} a large {{coalition of}} peoples, Alboin crossed the Julian Alps in 568, entering an almost undefended Italy. He rapidly {{took control of}} most of Venetia and Liguria. In 569, unopposed, he took northern Italy's main city, Milan. Pavia offered stiff resistance however, and was taken only after a siege lasting three years. During that time Alboin {{turned his attention to}} <b>Tuscany,</b> but signs of factionalism among his supporters and Alboin's diminishing control over his army increasingly began to manifest themselves.|$|E
