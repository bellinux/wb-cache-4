5|$|Gone with <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>has</b> {{been criticized}} as {{historical}} revisionism glorifying slavery, but nevertheless, {{it has been}} credited for triggering changes to the way African-Americans are depicted cinematically.

500|$|The {{hard part}} of filming was {{controlling}} the buildup; Beeman {{wanted to build}} the drama, visuals, and the wind from the storm up together. Mike Walls brought in [...] "jet-powered wind machines", which had been used for the movie Twister, to simulate the high velocity winds for the storm {{that was going to}} blow through Smallville. The [...] "wind" [...] is first introduced when Chloe arrives to pick Clark up for the prom.

500|$|Other non-sandy deserts {{consist of}} exposed {{outcrops}} of bedrock, dry soils or aridisols, {{and a variety}} of landforms affected by flowing water, such as alluvial fans, sinks or playas, temporary or permanent lakes, and oases. A hamada is a type of desert landscape consisting of a high rocky plateau where the sand has been removed by aeolian processes. Other landforms include plains largely covered by gravels and angular boulders, from which the finer particles have been stripped by the wind. These are called [...] "reg" [...] in the western Sahara, [...] "serir" [...] in the eastern Sahara, [...] "gibber plains" [...] in Australia and [...] "saï" [...] in central Asia. The Tassili Plateau in Algeria is an impressive jumble of eroded sandstone outcrops, canyons, blocks, pinnacles, fissures, slabs and ravines. In some places <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>has</b> carved holes or arches and in others it has created mushroom-like pillars narrower at the base than the top. In the Colorado Plateau it is water that has been the eroding force. Here the Colorado River has cut its way over the millennia through the high desert floor creating a canyon that is over a mile (6,000 feet or 1,800 meters) deep in places, exposing strata that are over two billion year old.|$|E
500|$|... "Lovebird" [...] {{was written}} by Bonnie McKee, Joshua Coleman and Dr. Luke, and {{produced}} by Josh Abrahams, Oligee, and Coleman (under his production name, Ammo). The song was engineered by Ryan Williams, assisted by Daniela Rivera. [...] "Lovebird" [...] was mixed by Phil Tan at the Ninja Beat Club in Atlanta, Georgia and mastered by Colin Leonard at SING Mastering using SING Technology, both located in Atlanta. The song was recorded at Pulse Recording in Los Angeles. [...] "Lovebird" [...] is a power ballad of three minutes and thirty seconds. The song's musical structure bears strong resemblances to one of Lewis' previous singles, [...] "Bleeding Love", from her début studio album Spirit (2007). The track opens with a piano introduction similar to that on [...] "Bleeding Love", and features an [...] "instantly hummable chorus". Lewis informs her lover in the lyrics – with the lines [...] "But the time went on, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>has</b> blown, and I have grown" [...] – that enough time has passed since their relationship started {{for her to have}} developed as a person. As power ballad beats and [...] "airy synths" [...] play, she sings [...] "Your lovebird's flying away/ Cos my heart's been stuck in a cage". The hook consists of Lewis singing [...] "I've got to sing my song, so pretty/ Dum, dum, diddy".|$|E

500|$|Gone with <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>has</b> {{been criticized}} as having perpetuated Civil War myths and black stereotypes. David Reynolds writes that [...] "The white women are elegant, their menfolk noble {{or at least}} dashing. And, in the background, the black slaves are mostly dutiful and content, clearly {{incapable}} of an independent existence." [...] Reynolds likened Gone with the Wind to The Birth of a Nation and other re-imaginings of the South during the era of segregation, in which white Southerners are portrayed as defending traditional values {{and the issue of}} slavery is largely ignored. The film {{has been described as a}} [...] "regression" [...] that promotes the myth of the black rapist and the honourable and defensive role of the Ku Klux Klan during Reconstruction, and as a [...] "social propaganda" [...] film offering a [...] "white supremacist" [...] view of the past. From 1972 to 1996, the Atlanta Historical Society held a number of Gone with the Wind exhibits, among them a 1994 exhibit titled, [...] "Disputed Territories: [...] Gone with the Wind and Southern Myths". One of the questions explored by the exhibit was [...] "How True to Life Were the Slaves in GWTW?" [...] This section showed slave experiences were diverse and concluded that the [...] "happy darky" [...] was a myth, as was the belief that all slaves experienced violence and brutality.|$|E
500|$|The third section, from Final Fantasy VIII, {{was also}} {{arranged}} by Wanamo, and is named [...] "Mono no aware" [...] after the Japanese {{term for the}} [...] "awareness of impermanence". The name is intended to capture a theme from the game of the conflict between childhood and adulthood, {{as well as the}} destruction of the present in favor of an uncertain future. The arrangement roughly follows the games storyline, fading away in the end like the game with uncertainty as to the conclusion of the characters' themes; Wanamo has said that the arrangement was difficult to create due to the similar emotional themes in many of the songs. Wanamo tried to [...] "explore pieces that shared fragments and worked well together", interleaving pieces and motifs throughout the arrangement. The final arrangement of the concert, that of Final Fantasy V, is named [...] "Library of Ancients". Valtonen based the arrangement on [...] "Musica Machina", played in the game in the ancient base underneath the library used by the heroes. As in the game <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>has</b> disappeared, the arrangement thereafter uses the song as a base to represent the source of the wind flowing from there through to other locations and battles from the game. The concerts feature two encore pieces; [...] "Clash on the Big Bridge" [...] from Final Fantasy V, which is interrupted and interspersed with the series' [...] "Chocobo Theme" [...] in humorous counterpoint, and [...] "Main Theme of Final Fantasy", originally from the first Final Fantasy game. The Tampere, Finland performance featured a third encore piece {{in the middle of the}} performance, a piano arrangement of [...] "You’re Not Alone" [...] by Wanamo.|$|E

2500|$|Hepburn's second film of 1964 was George Cukor's film {{adaptation}} of the stage musical My Fair Lady, released in November. Soundstage wrote that [...] "not since Gone with <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>has</b> a motion picture created such universal excitement as My Fair Lady", yet Hepburn's casting {{in the role of}} Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle sparked controversy. Julie Andrews, who had originated the role in the stage show, had not been offered the part because producer Jack L. Warner thought Hepburn or Elizabeth Taylor were more [...] "bankable" [...] propositions. Hepburn initially asked Warner to give the role to Andrews but was eventually cast. Further friction was created when, although non-singer Hepburn had sung in Funny Face and had lengthy vocal preparation for the role in My Fair Lady, her vocals were dubbed by Marni Nixon as the songs were not written for her vocal range. Hepburn was initially upset and walked off the set when informed.|$|E

But, together on the shore, Isoletta tells Baron Valdeburgo that she fears her Arturo has changed his attitude toward her and believes that he has {{fallen in love with}} a mysterious woman living as a hermit in a hut by the lake: (Duet: Isoletta to Valdeburgo: Agli atti, al volto / non mortal, divina imago / [...] "From her gestures, her expression, she {{did not appear to be}} mortal, but rather a divine image". Valdeburgo, to himself: Giovin rosa, il vergin seno / schiudi appena al ciel sereno / [...] "A newly bloomed rose has scarce opened / her virgin breast to the serene sky, / and already she wilts in pallor".)

2500|$|The Clarkson wind engine {{consisted}} of a rotor or a number of rotors, one behind the other, revolving in a casing with fixed guide vanes between and of opposite pitch {{to those of the}} rotors, and having a further casing to admit a fresh supply of wind to the rotors behind. The cylindrical casings are open at each end with a larger opening facing the wind. The wind catches a number of wheels and feathered vanes fixed to a shaft revolving in bearings inside the casings. When <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>has</b> passed between the vanes of the front wheel it is directed by the guide vanes to the second wheel and is again taken up by guides and passed to a third wheel and so on, the action each time increasing the effect of the wind on the shaft and improving efficiency. The Clarkson of which an illustration survives (1919) was erected by the Air Power Co. of Prestwich, Cheshire on the estate of Lord Derby. This small engine was designed to work in a [...] wind, but could start under load in a wind of only [...] The wind wheel was only [...] diameter and is designed to lift [...] of water per hour to a height of [...] in a [...] wind, or double that quantity in a [...] wind.
