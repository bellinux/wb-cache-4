5|$|The final {{match on}} the undercard was a {{standard}} match that featured Triple H and The Rock. Continuing the storyline of The Rock's injured arm, Triple H was scripted to target and attack The Rock's arm. Towards {{the final moments}} of the bout, Triple H asked Chyna, his valet, to retrieve a folding chair. The referee, however, <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> from him, which led to an argument between Triple H and the referee; the mishap prompted Triple H to push the referee down. The referee disqualified Triple H for this action; thus, The Rock won the match. After the match, Mankind ran in to save The Rock from Triple H and Chyna.|$|E

Cancellara came close to another stage win in the stage nine individual time trial, but fell short by seventeen seconds. Next, Cancellara won the prologue of the Tour de France. He then held the lead until the second stage came to an end, after stage winner Sylvain Chavanel <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> However, Cancellara regained the lead the after {{the next day and}} held it until stage seven when Chavanel again took the lead. Later in the Tour, Cancellara won the stage nineteen individual time trial that stretched from Bordeaux to Pauillac by seventeen seconds over German rider Tony Martin.|$|E
5|$|South Slavic legends about Kraljević Marko or Krali Marko are {{primarily}} based on myths {{much older than}} the historical Marko Mrnjavčević. He differs in legend from the folk poems; in some areas he was imagined as a giant who walked stepping on hilltops, his head touching the clouds. He {{was said to have}} helped God shape the earth, and created the river gorge in Demir Kapija ("Iron Gate") with a stroke of his sabre. This drained the sea covering the regions of Bitola, Mariovo and Tikveš in Macedonia, making them habitable. After the earth was shaped, Marko arrogantly showed off his strength. God <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> by leaving a bag as heavy as the earth on a road; when Marko tried to lift it, he lost his strength and became an ordinary man.|$|E

25|$|Twentieth-Century Fox brought Allen {{in for a}} rewrite {{when they}} were unhappy with the script that David Mamet had {{produced}} from Barry Reed's novel The Verdict, thinking he had deviated too much from the original material. She produced a script they were happy with, but then handed it to Robert Redford, who began to tinker it to fit his persona. Eventually the producers <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> from Redford and offered it to Lumet, who had just seen a production of Mamet's, American Buffalo with Al Pacino, and preferred to use Mamet's original script. In the end the studio had paid both Allen and Redford and ended up with Mamet's original script anyway.|$|E

500|$|Dylan {{composed}} {{this song}} {{in the form of}} a 12-bar blues. In the sleeve notes of Freewheelin, Dylan explained to Nat Hentoff: [...] "What made the real blues singers so great is that they were able to state all the problems they had; but at the same time, they were standing outside of them and could look at them. And in that way, they had them beat." [...] Into this song, Dylan injected one explicit mention of an absence that was troubling him: the sojourn of Suze Rotolo in Perugia: [...] "My baby took my heart from me/ She packed it all up in a suitcase/ Lord, she <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> to Italy, Italy." ...|$|E

500|$|The Black Crowes had {{previously}} sent Was demos to interest him in producing By Your Side, but Was believed the demos were {{good enough to}} be the album. Columbia Records disagreed with Was' assessment, however, leading to Kevin Shirley's hiring. With complete artistic control under V2 Records, the band was free to hire Was for Lions. [...] Recording took place in January and [...] at Montana Rehearsal Studios and Theater 99 Recording in New York City. [...] The recording sessions progressed as smoothly as the writing; only [...] "Come On" [...] caused conflict between the band and Was. Rich acknowledged, [...] "We must have recorded 'Come On' about five times in different ways... Then [...] just <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> with him and came back with this different mix", which impressed the band, leading to its inclusion on the album. [...] The band ultimately was satisfied by the recording experience, finding that Was was devoted to helping realize their vision for the album rather than imposing his own.|$|E
500|$|The {{first session}} was on 26 February, {{three of the}} first songs—fully {{recorded}}—attempted during the session were [...] "Baby Lemonade", [...] "Maisie" [...] and [...] "Gigolo Aunt". However, Gilmour thought they were losing the [...] "Barrett-ness". After [...] "Baby Lemonade" [...] was attempted, 2 takes of [...] "Maisie" [...] were recorded before Barrett went into 15 takes of [...] "Gigolo Aunt". The next day, two-track demos of [...] "Wolfpack", [...] "Waving My Arms in the Air", [...] "Living Alone" [...] and [...] "Bob Dylan Blues", were recorded. The former two {{made it to the}} album; the latter two didn't. On the recording sheet, it lists Gilmour as having taken home a copy of the latter two, Gilmour later returned and took the master tapes too. Gilmour has since said [...] "Those sessions were done so quickly. We were rushing to gigs every day and had to fit recording sessions in between. I probably <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> to have a listen and simply forgot to take it back. It wasn't intended to be a final mix. Syd knocked it off, I took a tape home." [...] Despite some minor work made to [...] "Gigolo Aunt", Barrett wouldn't return to Abbey Road Studios until 1 April, due to Pink Floyd working on their 1970 album, Atom Heart Mother. On various occasions, Barrett would [...] "spy" [...] on the band as they recorded the album. Again, Barrett recorded some work to a song, [...] "Wolfpack," [...] on the 3rd, before the sessions were postponed until 5 June, this time due to Gilmour and Wright going on tour in the US with Pink Floyd.|$|E
500|$|Inevitably {{linked with}} Roosevelt, Taft {{generally}} {{falls in the}} shadow of the flamboyant Rough Rider, who chose him to be president, and who <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> Yet, a portrait of Taft as a victim of betrayal by his best friend is incomplete: as Coletta put it, [...] "Was he a poor politician because he was victimized or because he lacked the foresight and imagination to notice the storm brewing in the political sky until it broke and swamped him?" [...] Adept at using the levers of power in a way his successor could not, Roosevelt generally got what was politically possible out of a situation. Taft was generally slow to act, and when he did, his actions often generated enemies, as in the Ballinger–Pinchot affair. Roosevelt was able to secure positive coverage in the newspapers; Taft had a judge's reticence in talking to reporters, and, with no comment from the White House, hostile journalists would supply the want with a quote from a Taft opponent. And it was Roosevelt who engraved in public memory the image of Taft as a Buchanan-like figure, with a narrow view of the presidency which made him unwilling to act for the public good. Anderson pointed out that Roosevelt's Autobiography (which placed this view in enduring form) was published after both men had left the presidency (in 1913), was intended in part to justify Roosevelt's splitting of the Republican Party, and contains not a single positive reference to the man Roosevelt had admired and hand-picked as his successor. While Roosevelt was biased, he was not alone: every major newspaper reporter of that time who left reminiscences of Taft's presidency was critical of him. Taft replied to his predecessor's criticism with his constitutional treatise on the powers of the presidency.|$|E

2500|$|The 2010 Under-19 Cricket World Cup {{was held}} in New Zealand in January 2010. [...] The tournament was hosted in New Zealand after the ICC <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> from Kenya on the flimsiest of reasons which {{ridiculed}} its own mission to spread the game. Kenya were further kicked by the ICC as their side {{was not allowed to}} participate as it had not won the African qualifying event - a weakened side had been fielded as at the time, as hosts, they did not need to qualify. As it was, New Zealand did a decent job but crowds were dismal and the group stages were as tediously predictable as in the senior tournament, with the better-funded big nations dominating. South Africa did beat Australia in a good match but a dead rubber. The competition came alive in the quarter-finals as West Indies beat England and Sri Lanka defeated South Africa. The best tie of the competition came when Pakistan beat fierce rivals India by two wickets with three balls remaining in a low-scoring match. The final between Australia and Pakistan was a rematch of the first tournament, and Australia won by 25 runs in a game where fortunes ebbed and flowed throughout.|$|E

2500|$|On {{arrival in}} Italy, {{he moved into}} a villa on the Spanish Steps in Rome, today the Keats–Shelley Memorial House museum. Despite care from Severn and Dr. James Clark, his health rapidly deteriorated. The medical {{attention}} Keats received may have hastened his death. In November 1820, Clark declared {{that the source of}} his illness was [...] "mental exertion" [...] and that the source was largely situated in his stomach. Clark eventually diagnosed consumption (tuberculosis) and placed Keats on a starvation diet of an anchovy and a piece of bread a day intended to reduce the blood flow to his stomach. He also bled the poet; a standard treatment of the day, but was likely a significant contributor to Keats's weakness. Severn's biographer Sue Brown writes: [...] "They could have used opium in small doses, and Keats had asked Severn to buy a bottle of opium when they were setting off on their voyage. What Severn didn't realise was that Keats saw it as a possible resource if he wanted to commit suicide. He tried to get the bottle from Severn on the voyage but Severn wouldn't let him have it. Then in Rome he tried again... Severn was in such a quandary he didn't know what to do, so in the end he went to the doctor who <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> As a result Keats went through dreadful agonies with nothing to ease the pain at all." [...] Keats was angry with both Severn and Clark when they would not give him laudanum (opium). He repeatedly demanded [...] "how long is this posthumous existence of mine to go on?" ...|$|E
