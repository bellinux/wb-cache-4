5|$|David Wallace {{comes to}} the Scranton branch and says that the client was so pleased with <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> that they {{decided to make the}} company their {{exclusive}} provider of office supplies. Grateful, David congratulates Dwight for the idea and after a moment's hesitation, Dwight accepts the credit. Michael is shocked and upset. The rest of the office, still angry at Michael for his near-disastrous idea, play along with Wallace's misunderstanding and congratulate Dwight. When David sets up a conference call with the marketing department so Dwight can explain his Golden Ticket promotion, Michael interrupts and goads Dwight into revealing the idea actually came from Michael. After much bickering between Michael and Dwight, a frustrated David leaves the office, appearing indifferent about the outcome.|$|E
5|$|Caulfield was {{chairman}} of the committee that drafted the policies, standards and procedures for water resources planning that became known as Senate Document 97, subjecting new federal water projects to benefit/cost analysis for the first time. He was the staff leader in drafting the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965 and was instrumental in its passage through the U.S. Congress; becoming the first Director of the Water Resources Council, a cabinet-level interagency advisory committee created by that Act. From October 1961 to August 1969 he was the leading professional official within the United States government developing and implementing policies for comprehensive river basin planning. In 1968 he drafted and gained political acceptance of a Water Resources Councils' regulation changing <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> rate used in planning water projects from a formula based on the coupon rate of government bonds to one based on the yield rate—a substantial and important policy change. He also had a leading role in early development of the Water Resources Council's Principles and Standards for water project planning promulgated in September 1973.|$|E
50|$|Debt {{cash flow}} is a finance term {{describing}} a firm's non-equity cash flows. Theoretically, adding <b>the</b> <b>discounted</b> debt cash flow to <b>the</b> <b>discounted</b> flows to equity (also known as equity Cash Flows) {{will give the}} firm's enterprise value, the valuation obtained by calculating <b>the</b> <b>discounted</b> cash flow.|$|R
50|$|When using <b>the</b> <b>discounted</b> {{payback period}} for {{decision}} making, a firm must first determine a discount {{rate at which}} to <b>discount</b> <b>the</b> future cash flow values of a specified period of time. For example, they could <b>discount</b> <b>the</b> future cash flows for the next 4 years. Once <b>the</b> <b>discounted</b> cash flow values have been calculated they should be positive values. After that you follow the same procedure you would to calculating the payback period. <b>The</b> <b>discounted</b> payback period should be in terms of years. If <b>the</b> <b>discounted</b> payback period {{is less than the}} predetermined period of time then the decision rule is to accept the project. On the other hand, if <b>the</b> <b>discounted</b> payback period is greater than the predetermined period then the decision rule would be to reject the project.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{degree of}} <b>discounting</b> is vitally {{important}} in describing hyperbolic <b>discounting,</b> especially in <b>the</b> <b>discounting</b> of specific rewards such as money. <b>The</b> <b>discounting</b> of monetary rewards varies across age groups due to <b>the</b> varying <b>discount</b> rate. <b>The</b> rate depends {{on a variety of}} factors, including the species being observed, age, experience, and the amount of time needed to consume the reward.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>discount</b> {{for lack}} of control is {{separate}} and distinguishable from <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> {{for lack of}} marketability. It is the valuation professional's task to quantify the lack of marketability of an interest in a privately held company. Because, in this case, the subject interest is not a controlling interest in the Company, {{and the owner of}} that interest cannot compel liquidation to convert the subject interest to cash quickly, and no established market exists on which that interest could be sold, <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> for lack of marketability is appropriate.|$|E
25|$|In DCF valuations, <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> rate, {{often an}} {{estimate}} of the cost of capital for the business, is used to calculate the net present value of a series of projected cash flows. <b>The</b> <b>discount</b> rate can also be viewed as the required rate of return the investors expect to receive from the business enterprise, given the level of risk they undertake.|$|E
25|$|A {{discount}} rate or capitalization rate {{is used to}} determine the present value of the expected returns of a business. <b>The</b> <b>discount</b> rate and capitalization rate are closely related to each other, but distinguishable.

30|$|Huang et al. (Huang et al., 2016) specify that a {{low level}} of {{interest}} rates makes <b>the</b> <b>discounting</b> cash flow high, thus justifying the increase in current stock prices. Based on the stock valuation models, stock prices are predicted by <b>the</b> <b>discounted</b> value of expected cash flow. Therefore, according to the theory, the primary factor determining the value of stocks is directly related to <b>the</b> <b>discounting</b> rate, namely interest rates.|$|R

25|$|Careful {{matching}} of <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> rate to {{the appropriate}} measure of economic income {{is critical to the}} accuracy of the business valuation results. Net cash flow is a frequent choice in professionally conducted business appraisals. The rationale behind this choice is that this earnings basis corresponds to the equity discount rate derived from the Build-Up or CAPM models: the returns obtained from investments in publicly traded companies can easily be represented in terms of net cash flows. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> rates are generally also derived from the public capital markets data.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{dividend}} <b>discount</b> {{model is}} closely related to both discounted earnings and discounted cashflow models. In either of the latter two, the value of a company is based on how much money is made by the company. For example, if a company consistently paid out 50% of earnings as dividends, then <b>the</b> <b>discounted</b> dividends would be worth 50% of <b>the</b> <b>discounted</b> earnings. Also, in <b>the</b> dividend <b>discount</b> model, a company that does not pay dividends is worth nothing.|$|R
25|$|The {{alternate}} case {{is where}} the government receives more taxes on a particular day than it spends. In this case, {{there may be a}} system-wide deficit of reserves. As a result, surplus funds will be in demand on the interbank market, and thus the short-term interest rate will rise towards <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> rate. Thus, if the central bank wants to maintain a target interest rate somewhere between the support rate and <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> rate, it must manage the liquidity in the system to ensure that there is the correct amount of reserves in the banking system.|$|E

25|$|Banks {{with more}} {{reserves}} {{than they need}} {{will be willing to}} lend to banks with a reserve shortage on the interbank lending market. The surplus banks will want to earn a higher rate than the support rate that the central bank pays on reserves; whereas the deficit banks will want to pay a lower interest rate than <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> rate the central bank charges for borrowing. Thus they will lend to each other until each bank has reached their reserve requirement. In a balanced system, where there are just enough total reserves for all the banks to meet requirements, the short-term interbank lending rate will be in between the support rate and <b>the</b> <b>discount</b> rate.|$|E
