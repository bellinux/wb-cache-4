5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> of {{oil shale}} in Estonia, {{both of which}} are {{sedimentary}} rocks laid down during the Ordovician geologic period. Graptolitic argillite is the larger resource, but, because its organic matter content is relatively low, it is not used industrially. The other one is kukersite, which has been mined for almost a hundred years and is expected to last for another 25–30years. By the end of 2012, the total kukersite resource was 4.8billion tonnes, of which up to 650million tonnes was recoverable. Kukersite deposits in Estonia account for 1.1% of global oil shale deposits.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> of flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.|$|E
5|$|Geometrical optics {{provides}} further matrix applications. In this approximative theory, {{the wave}} nature of light is neglected. The {{result is a}} model in which light rays are indeed geometrical rays. If the deflection of light rays by optical elements is small, the action of a lens or reflective element on a given light ray can be expressed as multiplication of a two-component vector with a two-by-two matrix called ray transfer matrix: the vector's components are the light ray's slope and its distance from the optical axis, while the matrix encodes {{the properties of the}} optical element. Actually, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> of matrices, viz. a refraction matrix describing the refraction at a lens surface, and a translation matrix, describing the translation of the plane of reference to the next refracting surface, where another refraction matrix applies.|$|E

25|$|Bank {{statements}} are accounting records produced by banks under the various accounting {{standards of the}} world. Under GAAP <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> of accounts: debit and credit. Credit accounts are Revenue, Equity and Liabilities. Debit Accounts are Assets and Expenses. The bank credits a credit account to increase its balance, and debits a credit account to decrease its balance.|$|E

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> of lacquer, laca, {{using more}} modern {{chemicals}} and maque, a pre Hispanic method using a wax {{derived from the}} female insect coccus axin found in the Tierra Caliente, as well as chia, chicalote or more recently linseed oils. Thse are mixed with dolomite limestone or lime-enriched plaster, locally called teputzchuta. Colorings are usually mineral in origin but sometimes from animal and vegetable sources as well.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, an {{equation}} {{is a statement}} of an equality containing one or more variables. Solving the equation consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true. Variables are also called unknowns and {{the values of the}} unknowns which satisfy the equality are called solutions of the equation. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> of equations: identities and conditional equations. An identity is true for all values of the variable. A conditional equation is true for only particular values of the variables.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> of {{competition}} sparring: point sparring, {{in which all}} strikes are light contact and the clock is stopped when a point is scored; and Olympic sparring, where all strikes are full contact and the clock continues when points are scored. Sparring involves a Hogu, or a chest protector, which muffles any kick's damage to avoid serious injuries. Helmets and other gear is provided as well. Though other systems may vary, a common point system works like this: One point for a regular kick to the Hogu, two for a turning behind kick, three for a back kick, and four for a spinning kick to the head.|$|E

25|$|Microsporogenesis (part of pollen formation) distinguishes {{some members}} of Asparagales from Liliales. Microsporogenesis {{involves}} a cell dividing twice (meiotically) to form four daughter cells. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> of microsporogenesis: successive and simultaneous (although intermediates exist). In successive microsporogenesis, walls are laid down separating the daughter cells after each division. In simultaneous microsporogenesis, there is no wall formation until all four cell nuclei are present. Liliales all have successive microsporogenesis, which {{is thought to be}} the primitive condition in monocots. It seems that when the Asparagales first diverged they developed simultaneous microsporogenesis, which the 'lower' Asparagale families retain. However, the 'core' Asparagales (see Phylogeny section) have reverted to successive microsporogenesis.|$|E
25|$|A similar defense {{comes from}} Australian philosopher Frank Jackson (born 1943) who revived {{the theory of}} epiphenomenalism which argues that mental states do not {{play a role in}} {{physical}} states. Jackson argues that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> of dualism. The first is substance dualism that assumes there is second, non-corporeal form of reality. In this form, body and soul are two different substances. The second form is property dualism that says that body and soul are different properties of the same body. He claims that functions of the mind/soul are internal, very private experiences that are not accessible to observation by others, and therefore not accessible by science (at least not yet). We can know everything, for example, about a bat's facility for echolocation, but we will never know how the bat experiences that phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|That is, the {{partition}} of vertices among the different colors is as uniform as possible. For instance, giving each vertex a distinct color would be equitable, but would typically use many more colors than are necessary in an optimal equitable coloring. An equivalent way of defining an equitable coloring {{is that it is}} an embedding of the given graph as a subgraph of a Turán graph with the same set of vertices. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>kinds</b> of chromatic number associated with equitable coloring. The equitable chromatic number of a graph G is the smallest number k such that G has an equitable coloring with k colors. But G might not have equitable colorings for some larger numbers of colors; the equitable chromatic threshold of G is the smallest k such that G has equitable colorings for any number of colors {{greater than or equal to}} k.|$|E
