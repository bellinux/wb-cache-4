25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 233, the Xianbei {{chieftain}} Budugen, who had previously surrendered to Wei, rebelled and collaborated with another Xianbei leader Kebineng. Bi Gui, the Inspector of Bing Province in Wei, led an army from his province to attack the Xianbei but was defeated. Budugen and Kebineng became more united after <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> constantly raided Wei's northeastern borders. Cao Rui ordered Qin Lang to lead another army from the capital to attack the Xianbei, and Qin succeeded in driving the enemy far into the deserts in the north. By winter, Budugen's subordinates had surrendered to Qin Lang in Bing Province, so Qin and his army returned to Luoyang.|$|E
25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? All that kind of stuff. Once we got through <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the hardest one to watch for me because we'd worked so hard on it and you could see all the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E
25|$|From 1970 to 2009, the House {{expanded}} delegates, {{along with}} their powers and privileges representing U.S. citizens in non-state areas, beginning with representation on committees for Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner in 1970. In 1971, a delegate for the District of Columbia was authorized, and in 1972 new delegate positions were established for U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. 1978 saw an additional delegate for American Samoa, and another for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands began in 2009. These six Members of Congress enjoy floor privileges to introduce bills and resolutions, and in recent congresses they vote in permanent and select committees, in party caucuses and in joint conferences with the Senate. They have Capitol Hill offices, staff and two annual appointments {{to each of the}} four military academies. While their votes are constitutional when Congress authorizes their House Committee of the Whole votes, recent Congresses have not allowed for <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> cannot vote when the House is meeting as the House of Representatives.|$|E

500|$|While {{there are}} certain aspects readers can almost always expect in García Márquez's writing, like {{instances}} of humour, he did not stick to any clear and predetermined style template. In an interview with Marlise Simons, García Márquez noted:In every book I {{try to make a}} different path [...] One doesn't choose the style. You can investigate and try to discover what the best style would be for a theme. But the style is determined by the subject, by the mood of the times. If you try to use something that is not suitable, it just won't work. Then the critics build theories around <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> see things I hadn't seen. I only respond to our way of life, the life of the Caribbean.|$|E
500|$|With the {{publication}} of the 25th anniversary edition in 2000, the historians of biology Michael Yudell and Rob Desalle reviewed the nature-nurture controversy around the book. [...] "Once again", they wrote, [...] "biological reductionism and genetic determinism became the focus of rancorous debates, discussions and diatribes within both academia and popular culture." [...] They pointed out that the quest for a [...] "sociobiologization" [...] of biology was not new, mentioning Darwin's The Descent of Man, R.A. Fisher, and Julian Huxley, all touching on the biological basis of human society, followed by Konrad Lorenz, Desmond Morris and Robert Ardrey in the 1960s, and Richard Dawkins and David Barash in the 1970s. Wilson's choice of title echoed the modern synthesis (named by Huxley in 1942) and, the reviewers argued, meant to build upon and extend it. 25 years on, they noted, most of the discord had gone, and the discipline had been renamed as evolutionary psychology; they were surprised to find that Wilson was happy with <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> called the new discipline pop psychology for people [...] "who like telling just-so stories".|$|E
500|$|In the English-language version, IGN {{said that}} the {{character}} [...] "has a tendency to speak a little too high and fast when he gets excited". Andrew Long of RPGamer criticized James Arnold Taylor's work, saying that Tidus is supposed to sound [...] "impulsive and energetic" [...] but his dialogue is [...] "stupid and childish". Eurogamer's Tom Brawell agreed, calling Tidus' voice [...] "whiny" [...] and [...] "detestable". Despite his dislike of the voice acting, Chris Carter of Destructoid enjoyed playing as Tidus in the crossover fighting game Dissidia Final Fantasy and looked forward to its reboot. On the other hand, PSXextreme liked Taylor's work in voicing Tidus. In the book Gaming Lives in the Twenty-First Century, the writers recalled that Tidus' characterization differs in the original Japanese release of Final Fantasy X and its English dub; the localized version failed to emulate the original Tidus. In a Final Fantasy X scene, Yuna tells Tidus to laugh (to cheer him up) and Tidus forces a laugh. Although fans criticised the laughter as too forced, Taylor {{said that it was}} supposed to sound like <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> should [...] "get over it". JoeHoganArt designed a YouTube video, [...] "Make Tidus Laugh! Tell Tidus a Tale", in which fans sent the actors puns and Taylor produced the forced laugh in response to the best ones received.|$|E

She raised her children Baptist. Kelly's father was absent throughout his son's life. Kelly's family lived in the Ida B. Wells Homes public housing project in Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood. Kelly's high school music teacher Lena McLin described Kelly's childhood home: [...] "It was bare. One table, two chairs. There was no father there, I knew <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> had very little". Kelly began singing in the church choir at age eight.|$|E

And what happened was, I saw Pong, and I said, well, that's the arena for him.

2500|$|Derbyshire {{beat the}} Bangladeshis {{with more than}} 10 overs to spare in a day-night match at Derby. The Bangladeshis won the toss and chose to bat first against a Derbyshire side that had made two changes from the National League game with Kent – the injured Michael di Venuto and Tim Lungley was left out for Nick Walker and Graeme Welch. When Javed Omar, Nafees Iqbal and Rajin Saleh were out in single figures the {{tourists}} fell to 19 for 3. Tushar Imran and Habibul Bashar then put on 80 for the fourth wicket, a partnership that included two sixes from Tushar Imran, but the Bangladeshis could not stretch any partnership past 30 following <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were all out for 189 with 3.5 overs to spare. Bangladesh's bowling, which had taken six wickets in the two Tests with England, took four wickets in Derbyshire's innings – including Walker, who had been promoted to opener with a List A average of 10.10 – but Jonathan Moss's 72 helped the hosts home with 11.5 overs and six wickets to spare.|$|E

2500|$|Kenseth {{started out}} his {{season with a}} {{promising}} race in the Daytona 500. He led 40 laps in the waning stages in the race. He took the white flag to start the final lap, but was passed by teammate Denny Hamlin and Martin Truex, Jr.. Kenseth's attempt at blocking backfired as he went sideways and lost several positions. Kenseth finished 14th while Hamlin edged Truex to the stripe to win the closest finish in the race's history. One week later in the Atlanta race, he was tagged for [...] "improper fueling" [...] during a green flag pit stop {{and was forced to}} serve a pass-through penalty. He was given the black flag with the white cross marks for not pitting within three laps. After serving that penalty, he ended up in 31st two-laps down. After the race, he said [...] "I got black-flagged for some type of pit road penalty and I didn’t know it and pitted the lap they told me to do a pass through – I'm assuming they were black flagging us before <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> pulled our card. I never heard anything about it or at least saw the flag or anything, so I came when they told me to come and I guess they must have penalized us a couple laps or something. I don’t really know. I haven’t really seen it.” However, Kenseth did go on to finish 19th. He finished 37th at Las Vegas after being involved in a multi-car wreck with Chase Elliott, Kurt Busch, and Carl Edwards late in the race.|$|E
