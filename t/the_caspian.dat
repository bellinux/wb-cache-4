5|$|The Rus' {{launched}} the first large-scale raid in 913. A fleet of 500 ships reached the southern shores of <b>the</b> <b>Caspian</b> Sea through {{the country of}} the Khazars. In order to secure a peaceful passage through {{the land of the}} Khazars, the Rus' promised the Khazars half of their spoils. They sailed down the Dnieper River into the Black Sea, then into the Sea of Azov, then up the Don River past the Khazar city of Sarkel, and then by a portage reached the Volga, which led them into <b>the</b> <b>Caspian</b> Sea.|$|E
5|$|Another {{project is}} Baku–Tbilisi–Kars railway project, {{which will be}} able to shorten the route via <b>the</b> <b>Caspian</b> Sea by {{bypassing}} Iran. The new railway lines constructed in Kazakhstan will make it shorter. The new route, in this case, will be China–Kazakhstan–Azerbaijan–Georgia–Turkey.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Caspian</b> expeditions of the Rus' were {{military}} raids {{undertaken by}} the Rus' between 864 and 1041 on <b>the</b> <b>Caspian</b> Sea shores, of what are nowadays Iran, Dagestan, and Azerbaijan. Initially, the Rus' appeared in Serkland in the 9th century traveling as merchants along the Volga trade route, selling furs, honey, and slaves. The first small-scale raids {{took place in the}} late 9th and early 10th century. The Rus' undertook the first large-scale expedition in 913; having arrived on 500 ships, they pillaged in the Gorgan region, in the territory of present-day Iran, and more to the west, in Gilan and Mazandaran, taking slaves and goods. On their return, the northern raiders were attacked and defeated by the Khazars in the Volga Delta, and those who escaped were killed by the local tribes on the middle Volga.|$|E

40|$|On {{the ground}} of data {{obtained}} in 1998 – 2007, it was demonstrated that the geochemical barrier of the Volga delta – the shallow water of <b>the</b> North <b>Caspian</b> - serves as a filter preventing natural and anthropogenic hydrocarbons from entering into the high sea with the river runoff.  This circumstance explains a relevantly low level of <b>the</b> north <b>Caspian</b> offshore pollution and increased toxicity of desalinated water of <b>the</b> North <b>Caspian</b> in comparison to marine water. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUsing gravity, geoid, {{topography}} {{and surface}} heat flow data, we have modeled the density and temperature {{distribution in the}} lithosphere along three profiles crossing Iran in SW-NE direction from the Arabian foreland in the SW to <b>the</b> South <b>Caspian</b> Basin and <b>the</b> Turan Platform to the NE. We find thin lithosphere (100 - 120 km) underneath Central Iran, whereas thick lithosphere (up to 240 km), is found underneath Arabia, <b>the</b> South <b>Caspian</b> Basin and <b>the</b> Turan Platform. Crustal thickening is found under the Zagros and Alborz mountains (up to 60 km) and under the Kopet-Dagh Mountains (48 km), whereas the thin crust under <b>the</b> southern <b>Caspian</b> Sea is either an oceanic crust or a highly thinned continental one. Below <b>the</b> South <b>Caspian</b> Sea, <b>the</b> shape of the crust-mantle interface and {{the base of the}} lithosphere indicate a subduction of <b>the</b> South <b>Caspian</b> block towards <b>the</b> N-NW. Further east, under the Kopet-Dagh, no evidence for active subduction is visible. This can be explained by a rheologically very strong South Caspian block, surrounded by weaker continental lithosphere...|$|R

5|$|In August, Robinson {{was sent}} to Anzac Cove as a naval liaison officer and on his second day there, was badly wounded near the front line, forcing his {{evacuation}} to England, where King George V presented him with his medal at Buckingham Palace. Returned to the Mediterranean in December 1915 following his recuperation, {{he took over the}} coastal monitor HMS M21, in which he shelled Turkish positions throughout Egypt and Palestine and was awarded another mention in despatches and the Egyptian Order of the Nile, 4th Class. Returning to England in the summer of 1917, he narrowly missed selection for Keyes's operations against Zeebrugge and Ostend owing to his war wounds, and instead trained crews of coastal torpedo boats, a role which led to a distant posting in <b>the</b> <b>Caspian</b> Sea during the Russian Civil War, fighting the Bolshevik forces along the Russian coastline. Robinson commanded a squadron of coastal torpedo boats in <b>the</b> <b>Caspian</b> and forced the surrender of several enemy forts through aggressive tactics. These achievements would later win him the Imperial Russian Order of St. Anne, 2nd Class. His most notable achievement at this time was leading a small coastal motor boat inside the harbour of Fort Alexandrovsk, where he sank a barge and prompted a mass surrender from the garrison.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the cheetah ranged across vast {{stretches}} of Asia: from the Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula {{in the west}} to the Indian subcontinent in the east, and as far north as <b>the</b> <b>Caspian</b> and Aral Seas. However, the cheetah has disappeared from the majority of its historic range, save for Iran and possibly a few areas in Afghanistan, the Indian subcontinent, and Turkmenistan.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Syrrhaptes {{are found in the}} steppes of central Asia. Their range extends from <b>the</b> <b>Caspian</b> Sea through {{southern}} Siberia, Tibet and Mongolia to northern and central China. They are normally resident, but Pallas's sandgrouse can be locally migratory and very occasionally is irruptive, appearing in areas well outside its normal range. This happened in 1863 and 1888, and a major irruption took place in 1908 when many birds were seen as far afield as Ireland and the United Kingdom where they bred in Yorkshire and Moray.|$|E
40|$|We examine active {{deformation}} {{of the region}} surrounding <b>the</b> eastern South <b>Caspian</b> Sea {{using a combination of}} seismic, geological, geodetic, and geomorphological data. Global positioning system (GPS) velocities indicate a westward component of motion of <b>the</b> South <b>Caspian</b> basin, relative to Eurasia and central Iran. We identify major zones of shear (the Ashkabad and Shahrud fault zones) that accommodate this westward extrusion on either side of <b>the</b> South <b>Caspian</b> block. Estimates of total strike-slip motion could, at present-day slip rates derived from GPS observations, be achieved in ∼ 10 m. y. Therefore, the northwest extrusion of <b>the</b> South <b>Caspian</b> region, which is accommodated by subduction beneath <b>the</b> North <b>Caspian</b> region (stable Eurasia) along the Apsheron-Balkan sill, may also date from that time. This suggests that the onset of subduction may be older than previous estimates (ranging from 1. 8 to 5. 5 Ma).

5|$|Phocids {{are known}} to have existed for at least 15 million years, and {{molecular}} evidence supports a divergence of the Monachinae and Phocinae lineages 22mya. The fossil monachine Monotherium and phocine Leptophoca were found in southeastern North America. The deep split between the lineages of Erignathus and Cystophora 17mya suggests that the phocines migrated eastward and northward from the North Atlantic. The genera Phoca and Pusa could have arisen when a phocine lineage traveled from the Paratethys Sea to the Arctic Basin and subsequently went eastward. The ancestor of the Baikal seal migrated into Lake Baikal from the Arctic (via the Siberian ice sheet) and became isolated there. <b>The</b> <b>Caspian</b> seal's ancestor became isolated as the Paratethys shrank, leaving the animal in a small remnant sea, <b>the</b> <b>Caspian</b> Sea. The monochines diversified southward. Monachus emerged in the Mediterranean and migrated to the Caribbean and then the central North Pacific. The two extant elephant seal species diverged close to 4mya after the Panamanian isthmus was formed. The lobodontine lineage emerged around 9mya and colonized the southern ocean in response to glaciation.|$|E
