Shortly afterward, Jimsy goes to Mahesh's {{house with the}} magazine containing her photo. Although she rebukes him for photographing her without permission, she also praises the photo. They become interested in each other, and soon fall in love. Jimsy realises this first, and calls Mahesh <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> future. She tells him that she is Jimson's younger sister, but his agitation is overshadowed by love and he decides to continue their relationship.|$|E
5|$|People {{struggled}} to survive together, and a rich culture based on shebeens (informal and mostly illegal pubs), mbaqanga music and beer-brewing developed. The shebeens {{were one of}} the main forms of entertainment. People came to the shebeens not only for skokiaan or baberton (illegally self-made alcoholic beverages), but <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> daily worries, their political ideas and their fears and hopes. In these shebeens the politicians tried to influence others and get them to conform to their form of thinking. If one disagreed he immediately became suspect and was classified as a police informer.|$|E

50|$|Michael is a {{young boy}} on a bus who competes with an old man for bus tickets, which they both collect (as did Nyman as a child). The man {{turns out to be}} Kurt Schwitters, a dada artist who escaped Germany, {{although}} his wife has been killed and his son missing, and is facing deportation. They get <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> collections. Schwitters invites Michael to come to his apartment to see them. Michael refuses for obvious reasons, but asks what he does with them, and is told about merz collages.|$|R
25|$|Another aim is {{to provide}} a {{platform}} for local talent and bands to promote themselves, and is also a feature for local people <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> trade, crafts and charities, including Stafford MP Jeremy Lefroy, who chatted with the team and the restoration work they are involved in, and former Stafford Mayor Angela Loughran, who visited the station in April 2014.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{the social}} sharing of emotion derived from studies about {{emotional}} trauma. These studies show that after natural disasters, catastrophes, or life-change events people have a tendency <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> experiences and disclose their feelings and emotions. For example, in a 1975 study exploring the psychological reactions {{to the death of}} a loved one, it was found that 88% of bereavers felt a need to talk about the event to others. Other studies produced similar findings for people who experienced natural disasters and for cancer patients. Rimé later proposed the term “social sharing of emotions” to describe this phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Historical {{repression}} {{of identity and}} the inability to practice their culture and language has led the Talysh to an internalized self repression. This {{makes it hard to}} gauge support for any type of Talysh movement. According to Hema Kotecha, many Talysh fear being associated with the separatist Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic, with Russia, or with Armenia if they acknowledged or attempted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> beliefs in the public sphere. One instance of current repression was when a school in Lerik wanted to invite a poet from Lenkoran to have a party in his honor and for him to speak to Children; the headmaster was told that he would be dismessed if the event went ahead. The fear of the police is also another factor to this silence, although support for a secular democracy and shared Azerbaijani-Talysh feelings towards Nagorno-Karabakh contribute as well.|$|E

25|$|The social {{sharing of}} {{emotions}} {{is a phenomenon}} {{in the field of}} psychology that concerns the tendency to recount and share emotional experiences with others. According to this area of research, emotional experiences are not uniquely fleeting and internal. Scientific studies of catastrophes and important life events demonstrate the propensity of victims <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> experiences and express their emotions. At the onset of these empirical studies, Rimé et al. coined the term “social sharing of emotions” in 1991 to name the observed phenomenon. This research was a significant development in social psychology because it questioned the accepted view of emotions—that emotions are short-lived and intrapersonal episodes—that was prevalent in the literature. Yet, the first set of experiments revealed that 88–96% of emotional experiences are shared and discussed to some degree. Therefore, the studies concerning the social sharing of emotions contribute a substantial new perspective to the understanding of emotions and their underlying processes.|$|E
25|$|The next scene {{takes place}} in this back room. Drunk, Tamashima draws his sword and reveals himself as Nippon Daemon in a rousing speech, before {{demanding}} Kōbei hand over {{all the money in}} the shop. Though Rikimaru and Kozō have made off with 100 ryō, the entire ordeal was a ruse to help Daemon earn Kōbei's trust, and to get himself into the back room. Sōnosuke throws himself between the two, offering his own life instead of that of his father-in-law; Daemon stops, noting that he once had a son who would be roughly Sōnosuke's age. The two older men begin <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> pasts and come to the realization that not only is Daemon Sōnosuke's true father, but Kōbei is in fact Kozō's true father. Both men, for differing reasons, lost their sons at a crowded ritual ceremony at the Hase-dera over a decade prior, and agree to forget about Daemon's criminal scheme as they thank one another for taking care of one another's sons, though Kōbei does ask that Daemon attempt to turn all five of the thieves away from their lives of crime.|$|E

[...] He [...] "wanted to make a film that would revive and reassess their reputation". Years later, he met writer Lars K. Andersen, who had also read the book during his childhood, and this led them to envision a film. The project started in 1999; the idea for the film did not attract sponsors because it was viewed as [...] "past history" [...] or because it portrayed the resistance [...] "outrageously". This was precisely one of Madsen's objectives: <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> story because Danish wartime archives listed many fatalities simply as casualties of war instead of counting them as murders, thus [...] "suppress" [...] their real story.
