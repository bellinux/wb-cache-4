5|$|Advaita {{literally}} means non-duality, {{and it is}} a monistic {{system of}} thought. It deals with the non-dual nature of Brahman and Atman. Advaita is considered the most influential sub-school of the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy. Gaudapada {{was the first person to}} expound the basic principles of the Advaita philosophy in a commentary on the conflicting statements of the Upanishads. Gaudapada's Advaita ideas were further developed by Shankara (8th century CE). King states that Gaudapada's main work, Māṇḍukya Kārikā, is infused with philosophical terminology of Buddhism, and uses Buddhist arguments and analogies. King also suggests that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>clear</b> differences between Shankara's writings and the Brahmasutra, and many ideas of Shankara are at odds with those in the Upanishads. Radhakrishnan, on the other hand, suggests that Shankara's views of Advaita were straightforward developments of the Upanishads and the Brahmasutra, and many ideas of Shankara derive from the Upanishads.|$|E
5|$|Round Hill's elevated, fairly central {{position}} gives excellent {{inward and}} outward views. To the northeast, the South Downs can be seen; long {{views of the}} English Channel are possible to the south, beyond the city centre and St Peter's Church; to the southeast, Elm Grove, Race Hill and Brighton General Hospital {{can be seen on}} high ground beyond the Lewes Road valley; and to the west, Preston Park (the city's oldest and largest public park) can be seen. Crescent and Wakefield Roads have long southward views towards the city centre, as do the small blocks of flats which replaced some large villas {{in the middle of the}} suburb. The tall viaduct is the main landmark to the west and north. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>clear</b> views into Round Hill from many parts of Brighton, especially areas to the east and southeast such as Race Hill.|$|E

25|$|With few {{exceptions}} throughout the literature, symbolic predispositions has presented more substantive and statistical explanatory power on {{attitudes and behaviors}} than self-interest. Only in occasional exceptions, as when <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>clear</b> and substantial stakes as job cuts or regarding tax burdens or ambiguous and dangerous threats as compulsory military draft lottery, self-interest has a clear effect on political attitudes and behavior. Even in these cases, the impact of self-interest are quite specific to the issues in question.|$|E
25|$|The {{publication}} {{may vary}} from Pinto's manuscript (some sentences are erased {{and others are}} edited). The disappearance of references to the Society of Jesus, {{one of the most}} active religious orders in the Orient, is notable, as <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>clear</b> indications of Pinto's relationship with the society. Pinto's memoirs are just that, his memories of events, giving rise to doubts regarding historical accuracy. However, it documents the impact of the Asian civilizations on the Europeans and is a reasonable analysis of Portuguese action in the Orient (in comparison to Luís de Camões' Os Lusíadas).|$|E
25|$|He {{spoke on}} major spiritual traditions {{including}} Jainism, Hinduism, Hassidism, Tantrism, Taoism, Christianity, Buddhism, {{on a variety}} of Eastern and Western mystics and on sacred scriptures such as the Upanishads and the Guru Granth Sahib. The sociologist Lewis F. Carter saw his ideas as rooted in Hindu advaita, in which the human experiences of separateness, duality and temporality are held {{to be a kind of}} dance or play of cosmic consciousness in which everything is sacred, has absolute worth and is an end in itself. While his contemporary Jiddu Krishnamurti did not approve of Rajneesh, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>clear</b> similarities between their respective teachings.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{following}} the collapses, {{there was some}} confusion about who {{had the authority to}} carry out an official investigation. While <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>clear</b> procedures for the investigation of aircraft accidents, no agency had been appointed in advance to investigate building collapses. A team was quickly assembled by the Structural Engineers Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers, led by W. Gene Corley, Senior Vice President of CTLGroup. It also involved the American Institute of Steel Construction, the American Concrete Institute, the National Fire Protection Association, and the Society of Fire Protection Engineers. ASCE ultimately invited FEMA to join the investigation, which was completed {{under the auspices of the}} latter.|$|E
25|$|Cilicia Pedias ("flat Cilicia"—; Assyrian Kue), to the east, {{included}} the rugged spurs of Taurus {{and a large}} coastal plain, with rich loamy soil, known to the Greeks such as Xenophon, who passed through with his mercenary group of the Ten Thousand, for its abundance (euthemia), filled with sesame and millet and olives and pasturage for the horses imported by Solomon. Many of its high places were fortified. The plain is watered by the three great rivers, the Cydnus (Tarsus Çay), the Sarus (Seyhan) and the Pyramus (Ceyhan River), each of which brings down much silt from the deforested interior and which fed extensive wetlands. The Sarus now enters the sea almost due south of Tarsus, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>clear</b> indications that at one period it joined the Pyramus, {{and that the united}} rivers ran to the sea west of Kara-tash. Through the rich plain of Issus ran the great highway that linked east and west, on which stood the cities of Tarsus (Tarsa) on the Cydnus, Adana (Adanija) on the Sarus, and Mopsuestia (Missis) on the Pyramus.|$|E
500|$|The fort and fortlet at Castleshaw are {{situated}} on {{a step of}} Grindslow shale {{on the eastern side}} of Castleshaw Valley below Standedge, part of the Pennine ridge in northern England. From the site <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>clear</b> views up and down the valley, although it is overshadowed by higher ground on all sides. It is remote and exposed and lies along the Deva Victrix (Chester) to Eboracum (York) Roman road. The road crosses the Pennines at Standedge where the area dips and narrows, creating a traversable pass which would have been guarded by the Castleshaw fort. The nearest forts are Mamucium (Manchester) [...] to the west and one at Slack [...] to the east, both on the line of the Roman road. There was also possibly a fortlet or signal station at Worlow, between Slack and Castleshaw. The later fortlet is on the same site as the fort (...) [...]|$|E

500|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>clear</b> gender {{divisions}} {{among the}} Betsimisaraka. When traveling by {{foot in a}} mixed gender group, it is forbidden for women to walk before men. [...] Women are traditionally the ones to act as porters, carrying light items {{on the head and}} heavy items on the back; if a woman is present, it is considered ridiculous for a man to carry something. [...] When eating, men use a single spoon to fill their plates from the communal bowl and to eat the food on their plates, whereas women are required to use two separate spoons to fill their plates and to eat. Men are generally responsible for tilling the rice fields, obtaining food, gathering firewood and building the family home and furniture, and they engage in discussion and debate about public affairs. Women's tasks include growing crops, weeding the rice fields and harvesting and processing the rice, fetching water, lighting the hearth fire and preparing daily meals, and weaving.|$|E
500|$|The precise {{location}} of the Red Cliffs battlefield {{has long been the}} subject of both popular and academic debates, but has never been conclusively established. Scholarly debates have continued for at least 1,350 years , and a number of arguments in favour of alternative sites have been put forward. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>clear</b> grounds for rejecting at least some of these proposals, but four alternative locations are still advocated. According to , many of the current debates stem {{from the fact that the}} course and length of the Yangtze River between Wuli and Wuhan has changed since the Sui and Tang dynasties [...] The modern-day debate is also complicated by the fact that the names of some of the key locations have changed over the following centuries. For example, although modern Huarong city is located in Hunan, south of the Yangtze, in the 3rd century the city of that name was due east of Jiangling, considerably north of the Yangtze ( [...] ; [...] ). Moreover, one candidate site, Puqi (蒲圻), was renamed [...] "Chibi City" [...] (赤壁市) in 1998 in a direct attempt to tie this location to the historical battlefield.|$|E
500|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) {{is short}} and line-shaped, but longer than in other manavi-like species. The central groove in the nasal {{depression}} is relatively narrow. The frontal bones are rounded and bear a well-developed sagittal crest. Further back on the braincase, the lambdoid crest is also prominent. The middle part of the palate is flat, as in M.manavi but unlike in M.brachytragos, M.griveaudi, and M.mahafaliensis, which have a curved palate. At the palate's back margin is a long, thin posterior palatal spine. Miniopterus aelleni has 36teeth in the dental formula [...] (two incisors, one canine, two premolars, and three molars in both upper toothrows and three incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molars in the lower toothrows). As is characteristic of Miniopterus, the first upper premolar (P2; P1 and P3 are missing) is smaller and more simplified than the second (P4). <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>clear</b> diastemata (gaps) between the upper canine (C1) and P2 and between P2 and P4, which are weaker or absent in M.griveaudi and M.manavi. Behind C1, the toothrows are about parallel, not divergent as in M.manavi. The third upper molar (M3) is more compressed than in M.manavi and M.griveaudi. In some measurements of the skull and teeth, Anjouan specimens are larger than those from Madagascar.|$|E

500|$|Asked {{about the}} motif and [...] "casual {{approach}} to" [...] bisexual characters in his novels, continued in Imperial Bedrooms, Ellis stated he [...] "really [...] know", {{and that he}} wished he could provide [...] "an answer – depicting [...] as extremely conscious of those choices". He believes it to be an [...] "interesting aspect of [...] work". Details notes how Ellis' own sexuality, frequently described as bisexual, has been notoriously hard to pin down. Reviewers have long tried to probe Ellis on autobiographical themes in his work. He reiterates to Vice that he is not Clay. Ellis says that other contemporary authors (naming Michael Chabon, Jonathan Franzen, Jonathan Lethem as examples) don't get asked if their novels are autobiographical. (However, Ellis tells one interview, that he [...] "cannot fully" [...] say that [...] "I'm not Clay" [...] because of their emotional [...] "connections".) Vice attributes this streak to Ellis' age when Less Than Zero came out, which led to him being seen as a voice-of-the-generation. Ellis feels that the autobiographical truths of his novels lie in their writing processes, which to him are like emotional [...] "exorcisms". Crace's abovementioned parody suggests that Less Than Zero Clay was originally a flattering portrayal of Ellis. Ellis discusses lightly the kinds of self-insertion present in the book. While Clay is clearly (parodically) working on the film adaptation of The Informers, he {{is at the same time}} fully aware that he has been a character in Less Than Zero, and that ostensibly, Ellis is 'the author' whom Clay knew. However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>clear</b> differences to the characters, as well. For example, Ellis had to omit lines from the book he felt Clay would never have thought of, on subjects he would never have noticed. Ellis himself feels he is adapting to middle-age very well; Clay, however, isn't.|$|E
