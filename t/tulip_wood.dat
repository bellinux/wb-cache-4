[...] I stepped over {{and looked at it}} closely. It was made of <b>tulip</b> <b>wood,</b> inlaid in patterns; and was mounted in ormolu. I pulled open one of the drawers, a deep one where I could see the work to great advantage. As I pulled it, something rattled inside as though rolling; there was a tinkle as of metal on metal.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have spoken}} of two {{openings}} into the vale. From {{the one to}} the northwest issued a rivulet, which came, gently murmuring and slightly foaming, down the ravine, until it dashed against the group of rocks out of which sprang the insulated hickory. Here, after encircling the tree, it passed on {{a little to the}} north of east, leaving the tulip tree some twenty feet to the south, and making no decided alteration in its course until it came near the midway between the eastern and western boundaries of the valley. At this point, after a series of sweeps, it turned off at right angles and pursued a generally southern direction meandering as it went--until it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure (although roughly oval), that lay gleaming near the lower extremity of the vale. This lakelet was, perhaps, a hundred yards in diameter at its widest part. No crystal could be clearer than its waters. Its bottom, which could be distinctly seen, consisted altogether, of pebbles brilliantly white. Its banks, of the emerald grass already described, rounded, rather than sloped, off into the clear heaven below; and so clear was this heaven, so perfectly, at times, did it reflect all objects above it, that where the true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced, it was a point of no little difficulty to determine. The trout, and some other varieties of fish, with which this pond seemed to be almost inconveniently crowded, had all the appearance of veritable flying-fish. It was almost impossible to believe that they were not absolutely suspended in the air. A light birch canoe that lay placidly on the water, was reflected in its minutest fibres with a fidelity unsurpassed by the most exquisitely polished mirror. A small island, fairly laughing with flowers in full bloom, and affording little more space than just enough for a picturesque little building, seemingly a fowl-house--arose from the lake not far from its northern shore--to which it was connected by means of an inconceivably light--looking and yet very primitive bridge. It was formed of a single, broad and thick plank of the <b>tulip</b> <b>wood.</b> This was forty feet long, and spanned the interval between shore and shore with a slight but very perceptible arch, preventing all oscillation. From the southern extreme of the lake issued a continuation of the rivulet, which, after meandering for, perhaps, thirty yards, finally passed through the [...] "depression" [...] (already described) {{in the middle of the}} southern declivity, and tumbling down a sheer precipice of a hundred feet, made its devious and unnoticed way to the Hudson.|$|E

It contains the first two nature preserves in Delaware. These nature preserves are <b>Tulip</b> Tree <b>Woods</b> and Freshwater Marsh. Flint Woods is a satellite area of the park and has become the park's third nature preserve. Flint Woods is home to species of rare song birds and an old-growth forest.

50|$|The current Woodbridge Township Hall {{was built}} in 1855 after the Woodbridge Township board voted and {{approved}} $250 {{for the construction of}} a town hall. They also appropriated $10 to purchase a suitable site located in Section 16 of Woodbridge Township. The building committee eventually selected the building site at the corner of Woodbridge and Montgomery roads, just west, and above the St. Joseph River. The original structure was constructed using popular, or <b>tulip</b> <b>wood</b> and completed in 1856. Approximately twenty years later an addition was built onto the original structure and soon after, in 1890, polling booths and a dividing fence were completed.|$|E
50|$|MTD {{handmade}} American basses come in 35 inch-scale 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-string {{models and}} are available {{in a variety of}} configurations. Necks are made from maple or ash with a rosewood fingerboard. Wood bodies are made from medium weight ash, domestic <b>tulip</b> <b>wood</b> (aka Eastern yellow poplar), alder, and mahogany. MTD bodies and necks are ergonomically carved to allow access to the instrument's extended scale and feature an asymmetrical neck, a design where the neck is thinner on the lower side than the upper. Pickups and active electronics are a proprietary design for MTD made by Bill Bartolini. All currently manufactured MTD basses, including Kingston basses, employ the Buzz Feiten Tuning System.|$|E
5000|$|The Deperdussin Monocoque was a mid-wing {{monoplane}} with parallel-chord wings {{with the}} spars made of hickory and ash, and ribs made of pine. The fuselage {{was made in}} two halves, each made by glueing and pinned a layer of <b>tulip</b> <b>wood</b> to a framework of hickory supported by a former, and then applying two further layers of tulipwood, {{the thickness of the}} shell being around 4 mm ( [...] in). The shells were then removed from the formers, internal fittings added and the two halves glued together and covered in fabric. Every effort was made to reduce drag: a large spinner was fitted over the hub of the propeller and the undercarriage was an aerodynamically clean design made from a pair of U-shaped plywood frames.|$|E

40|$|Schizophyllum commune is an edible {{mushroom}} {{grown on}} wood under natural conditions. Present {{study focused on}} cultivation of S. commune on different wood substrates since it is not commercially cultivated. A pure culture of S. commune was obtained by growing a tissue of the mushroom on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) medium. Spawns were produced by growing the mycelium on paddy grains. Mushroom was cultivated on sawdust of seven different wood substrates. The maximum yield was observed in sawdust of jackfruit (Artocarpusheterophyllus) followed by sawdust of rambutan (Nepheliumlappaceum) and country almond (Terminaliacatappa). A significant difference was not observed when mango (Mangiferaindica) elephant apple (Dilleniaindica), <b>tulip</b> <b>wood</b> tree (Harpulliaarborea) and thungfaa (Alstoniamacrophylla) sawdust used as substrate. The lowest yield was observed in thungfaa (Alstoniamacrophylla) sawdust. Effect of some additives on the yield was studied and significant difference in yield was observed when rice bran and used-tea leaves used as additives. Effect of rice bran on yield was studied using different ratios of sawdust to rice bran and the highest was observed in 2 : 1 ratio of sawdust to rice bran. The best incubating temperature for mycelial growth on the substrate was 350 C. The composition of the mushroom on a dry weight basis was; 71. 4 % moisture, 23. 35 % crude protein and 6 % ash. Tested wood species are promising substrates for cultivation of S. communeas cottage industry...|$|E
