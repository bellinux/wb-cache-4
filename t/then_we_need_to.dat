At a Christian Science Monitor breakfast in June 2012, Barbour suggested that the Republican Party should take a more moderate approach to certain elements of its platform. He suggested barring corporations and unions from making direct campaign contributions, expressed satisfaction with Mitt Romney's moderate brand of Republicanism, and suggested that the party should soften its stance on illegal immigration and reach out to Latino voters: [...] "We need a secure border for lots of reasons, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> recognize that we're not going to deport 12 million people and we shouldn't." ...|$|E
