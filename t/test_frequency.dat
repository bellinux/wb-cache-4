This paper discusses issues relating to material attenuation, transducer design and performance, and instrumentation design for ultrasonic imaging, thickness gaging, and flaw detection at 50 MHz and up. Advances in transducer manufacturing technology and associated instrument electronics have led to the introduction of commercial products that provide the capability for ultrasonic imaging, thickness gaging, flaw detection, and material analysis at <b>test</b> <b>frequencies</b> greater than 50 MHz. In many materials like fine grain metals, ceramics, and thin polymers, these higher <b>test</b> <b>frequencies</b> permit measurement of significantly lower thickness limits and detection of significantly smaller flaws and other internal structures as compared to conventional <b>test</b> <b>frequencies</b> of 20 MHz and below.
