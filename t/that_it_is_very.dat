5|$|For a phylum with {{relatively}} few species, ctenophores {{have a wide}} range of body plans. Coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so fragile <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> difficult to capture them intact for study. In addition oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes. Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis. At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.|$|E
5|$|The deity {{depicted}} on page 9 of the Grolier Codex {{is believed to}} be the Mountain God with split head. This image was otherwise unknown in the 1960s. Other examples of it were later discovered at the Maya sites of Tancah and Pasión del Cristo. Coe and his colleagues argue <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> unlikely that a forger would have known about this deity before it was described elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In most jumping spiders, {{the main}} eyes focus {{accurately}} on an object {{up to about}} 75cm away. However, P. schultzi does not react at all to objectives when the light is under 100lux. Between 100 and 500lux, it detects and approaches the objective from distances up to 6cm, from 500lux to 1500lux, its response distance increases gradually {{to a maximum of}} about 10cm, and stronger light causes no increase in the response distance. For comparison, Trite auricoma swivels towards a movement up to 75cm away and approaches targets from about 20cm. Perhaps P. schultzi gains little from being alerted to objectives at distances because this spider moves so slowly <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> unlikely to reach a more distant target in time to catch it.|$|E

5|$|The predilection {{of insects}} for this {{mushroom}} was noted by 19th-century British mycologist Anna Maria Hussey, {{who wrote in}} 1847: {{there are very few}} of the soft-fleshed tribes, all of which are the nurseries of innumerable insects, so much in favour as the poisonous Boletus luridus, on breaking an old one it is a living mass of larvae. Our present subject is so soon attacked by insects <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> rare to find specimens devoid of wriggling life, and being a very common and abundant kind, it must be of great service in the economy of insect existence. Several fly species have been recorded feeding on the fruit bodies, including Phaonia boleticola, P.rufipalpis, Thricops diaphanus, and, in North America, Drosophila falleni, Pegomya mallochi, P.winthemi, Megaselia pygmaeoides, and Muscina assimilis. In contrast, slugs tend to avoid consuming this species.|$|E
5|$|Apolinario de la Cruz {{was born}} on July 22, 1815 in Barrio Pandác {{in the town of}} Lucban in Tayabas {{province}} (now Quezon Province) back when the Philippines was a colony of the Spanish Empire. His parents—Pablo de la Cruz and Juana Andres—were peasants and devout Catholics. Dela Cruz was literate, but stated that he had no formal education. Despite <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> likely that he received primary religious instruction and attended the local public primary school in Lucban. In 1829, he decided to become a priest and tried to join the Order of Preachers in Manila. During those times, Roman Catholic religious orders barred indios (native people of the Philippines) from joining, thus de la Cruz's application was rejected for the sole reason of his race. He then decided to work as a donado (lay brother) at the San Juan de Dios Hospital where he was admitted to the Cofradía de San Juan de Dios, a brotherhood affiliated with the hospital and was open to indios. During this time, he improved his public speaking and studied the Bible along with other religious writings.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns1 valence electron configuration, which results in weak metallic bonding. Hence, all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities, melting and boiling points, as well as heats of sublimation, vaporisation, and dissociation. They all crystallise in the body-centered cubic crystal structure, and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited. The ns1 configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic and ionic radii, as well as very high thermal and electrical conductivity. Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost s-orbital to form the +1 oxidation state, due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy. Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity; thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited. What little is known about francium shows <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> close in behaviour to caesium, as expected. The physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed; hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations.|$|E

50|$|Although Maguelone {{was well}} {{protected}} on the inland side, its strategic position meant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> vulnerable to invasions from the sea; in 673, the Visigoth King Wamba was besieged here {{during his campaign}} of reconquest of Narbonne.|$|R

25|$|The {{main problem}} with pottery is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> fragile. While well-fired clay is {{virtually}} indestructible, if bumped or dropped it will shatter.

25|$|Results of the {{experiment}} showed performance of {{the experiment}}al condition to be slightly less accurate than the no-overlap condition. Irwin attributed this decrease in accuracy to the extra neural processes involved in performing an eye movement, combined with processing the dot pattern. He concluded from this that transsaccadic memory does exist, but <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> similar if not identical to short term visual memory and less similar to sensory memory.|$|E
25|$|Roman and Jewish {{literary}} sources {{suggest that}} in the 1st century BC the domestic beet was represented in the Mediterranean basin primarily by leafy forms like chard and spinach beet. Zohary and Hopf also argue <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> probable that beetroot cultivars were also grown at the time, and some Roman recipes support this. Later English and German sources show that beetroots were commonly cultivated in Medieval Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Goodfellow {{was fascinated}} by the earth {{movement}} and studied the earthquake's effects.

25|$|The seepage {{salamander}} {{does not}} experience much {{competition from other}} species of salamanders due to its habitat. Because it is a terrestrial salamander, it is not disturbed by the semi-aquatic and aquatic salamanders. Almost all other Desmognathus species are found at closer distances to streams. The lack of competition also {{may be due to}} the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> secretive. It is seldom seen on the surface, which may be an anti-predatory response.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} {{of the staff}} and ticket system is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> inflexible. If a locomotive fails in a station, for example, a token staff {{may be at the}} wrong end of a section and will have to be moved by road. This situation does not occur under the Electric Token System (ETS), a more advanced system in which tokens can be obtained at either end of a section from a token instrument.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet light {{irradiation}} (UV, from a germicidal lamp) {{is useful for}} sterilization of surfaces and some transparent objects. Many objects that are transparent to visible light absorb UV. UV irradiation is routinely used to sterilize the interiors of biological safety cabinets between uses, but is ineffective in shaded areas, including areas under dirt (which may become polymerized after prolonged irradiation, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> difficult to remove). It also damages some plastics, such as polystyrene foam if exposed for prolonged periods of time.|$|E

25|$|Hyperion {{is unique}} among the large moons in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> irregularly shaped, has a fairly {{eccentric}} orbit, and is near {{a much larger}} moon, Titan. These factors combine to restrict the set of conditions under which a stable rotation is possible. The 3:4 orbital resonance between Titan and Hyperion may also make a chaotic rotation more likely. The fact that its rotation is not locked probably accounts for the relative uniformity of Hyperion's surface, in contrast to many of Saturn's other moons, which have contrasting trailing and leading hemispheres.|$|E

Gevar tells Höðr that he would most certainly approve of the marriage, but that Baldr has already requested Nanna's hand. Gevar says that he fears Baldr's wrath, for Baldr's body is infused with a holy strength and cannot be harmed by steel. Gevar is, however, aware of a sword that will kill Baldr, and he explains <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> well protected, and tells him how to retrieve the sword.|$|E
25|$|Although {{research}} has suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> difficult {{to eliminate the}} bias, some factors may help in closing the gap of the optimistic bias between an individual and their target risk group. First, by placing the comparison group closer to the individual, the optimistic bias can be reduced: studies found that when individuals were asked to make comparisons between themselves and close friends, {{there was almost no}} difference in the likelihood of an event occurring. Additionally, actually experiencing an event leads to a decrease in the optimistic bias. While this only applies to events with prior experience, knowing the previously unknown will result in less optimism of it not occurring.|$|E
