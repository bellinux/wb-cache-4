5|$|The President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, {{discussed}} {{the matter of}} command arrangements in the Pacific in Washington, D.C., on 9 March. Roosevelt proposed that <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> divided into British and American areas of responsibility, with the United States having responsibility for the Pacific, where {{there would be an}} American supreme commander responsible to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Churchill responded favourably to the proposal, and the governments of Australia and New Zealand were then consulted. They endorsed the idea of an American supreme commander, but wanted to have some input into matters of strategy.|$|E
5|$|With {{global warming}} causing glaciers and {{permafrost}} to melt rapidly and allowing {{a large amount}} of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be a disruption in the thermohaline circulation. Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, a disruption in this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> likely to have an effect on their migration. The whales summer in the cool, high latitudes, where they feed in krill-abundant waters; they winter in warmer, low latitudes, where they mate and give birth.|$|E

25|$|While {{most of this}} {{research}} was carried out in South Africa, it was recognised that further study in other areas of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> useful in selecting dung beetle species for introduction to Australian climates not matched by those in South Africa. To this end, a further research unit was set up in Montpellier, France, as a base from which to study European species that may be more suited for introduction to cooler, southern areas of Australia.|$|E

25|$|Fossils in China {{demonstrate}} a migration of Asian mammals into North America around 55 million years ago. By 20 million years ago, evidence in North America shows a further interchange of mammalian species. Some, like the ancient saber-toothed cats, have a recurring geographical range: Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America. The {{only way they}} could reach the New World was by the Bering land bridge.

25|$|Satellite radio (also called SDARS by the FCC) uses two {{proprietary}} standards instead of DAB-S, which requires users to change equipment when switching from one provider to the other, and prevents other competitors from offering new choices as stations {{can do on}} terrestrial radio. Had the FCC picked DAB-T for terrestrial radio, no separate satellite receiver would have been needed at all, and the only difference from DAB receivers {{in the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the need to tune S band instead of L band.|$|E
25|$|The novel Darwin's Dreams by Sean Hoade was {{published}} in 2008 and republished in a new edition in 2016. The novel begins with {{the first meeting of}} Darwin and FitzRoy and ends with Darwin receiving notice of FitzRoy's suicide. The plot is interlaced with fictional ″dreams″ that imagine how <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> if the ideas of evolutionary thinkers over the millennia had been literally true. The dreams also show how Darwin′s subconscious dealt with major themes in his life such as the death of his beloved daughter Annie and his lifelong friendship and rivalry with FitzRoy.|$|E

25|$|In the Islamic apocalyptic tradition, {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{preceded by}} the release of Gog and Magog, whose {{destruction}} by God in a single night would usher in the Day of Resurrection. Reinterpretation did not generally continue after Classical times, but {{the needs of the}} modern world have produced a new body of apocalyptic literature in which Gog and Magog are identified as the Jews and Israel, or the Ten Lost Tribes, or sometimes as Communist Russia and China. One problem these writers have had to confront is the barrier holding Gog and Magog back, which is not {{to be found in the}} modern world: the answer varies, some writers saying that Gog and Magog were the Mongols and that the wall is now gone, others that both the wall and Gog and Magog are invisible.|$|E
