50|$|Jonathan ben Uzziel was a pupil of Hillel the Elder. According to scholars, Targum Jonathan ben Uzziel {{found in}} the Chumash was not written by Jonathan ben Uzziel, who refer to it instead as Pseudo-Jonathan. According to the Encyclopaedia Judaica {{internal}} evidence shows that it was written sometime between the 7th and 14th centuries CE.

And if they do, there's {{got to be a}} consequence. We make directly culpable the people who love him most." [...] Bob Guza on the consequences of Michael's actions. From November 2007 to February 2008, then headwriter, Robert Guza temporarily vacated his post during the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike and was temporarily replaced by Garin Wolf. It was during this time that the first gun violence storyline with Michael unfolded and Michael accidentally shoots Kate Howard (Megan Ward). Though his family uncovers his involvement in the shooting, Michael does not face any consequences. When Guza returned to his post as head writer, rumors circulated on Internet message boards that Michael would be the next casualty of a mob war. According to one poster, Michael would be left comatose in order to [...] "spirit the character off the canvas and ignite the current true-loving Jason's bloodlust for the Zaccharas." [...] It was originally speculated that the character would be killed off the show entirely. The storyline culminated on April 4, 2008 and the character ends up in a coma. [...] "It will play out for months. It's a major, major thing. And the ripple effect on the emotional lives of the characters {{is going to go on}} for maybe years… You're going to see relationships shatter, new relationships forged out of grief and a need to understand the un-understandable. That's the only way you can justify doing it." [...] Bob Guza on the aftermath of Michael's shooting. It was Guza's belief that the most appropriate way to address fan disapproval of the lack of consequences for Michael's recent actions was to have Michael take a bullet himself. According to Guza, the incident also forces—Sonny, Carly, Jason, and Jax—the adults in Michael's life to reevaluate their choices. Guza's dialogue for the Johnny Zacchara character expresses that all four are to blame, stating, [...] "kill each other for power <b>and</b> money <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> lie <b>and</b> <b>say</b> that we have honor, that we protect family, that women and children are safe." [...] However, Michael's shooting would not completely do away with the violence in the show. It instead serves as a catalyst forcing those around Michael to make life-altering decisions.|$|R
40|$|Some musicians have {{difficulty}} {{with the concept of}} 'algorithmic composition', so at the start I might <b>turn</b> the notion <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> that I believe that all composition is algorithmic composition, whether composers realise this or not. Composers imagine soundworlds, and construct new sound experiences which evolve through time. So there are two parts to their activities: one is involved with the imagining, the other with the realisation- everything that is to do with the putting-together of the composition that is to be heard by an audience. The imagining part is very small, but of course essential. It takes up very little time, compared with that spent in the realisation. Sometimes it may even seem as if the imagining is instantaneous, and we describe it as a 'moment of inspiration'. This moment gives the composer a mental model, a conception about how the musical idea may be expressed. It gives a conception which is a network of musical relationships- not one, at this level, which needs to be expressed in time, because the conception, the mental model, is complete The way that this model will unfold in time is the task of realisation. The model {{can be thought of as}} the seed- a tiny part. The major task of the composer is the realisation. Composers think in symbolic forms- they have evolved symbols which are useful to them in beginning to express their conceptions. Working with symbols, writing down what we can call musical ideas in symbolic terms, usually involves compromise. Perhaps the repertory of symbols is not rich enough to capture the essence of the imagine...|$|R
40|$|One {{could ask}} oneself {{what is the}} {{importance}} of reading, and why should anyone read? I would like to <b>turn</b> the question <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> why not? This is a pedagogical essay that will discuss the theory and practice of teaching literature in schools. The use of literature in schools is often limited to the reading itself, without connections to a broader perspective, or while-reading activities, followed by oral discussions, or book reviews. A different approach, putting the novel {{at the center of the}} teaching for a period of several weeks, is what I aim to present, suggesting coherent lessons with a theme to follow, instead of non-related chapters from a textbook. Harper Lee wrote the magnificent novel To Kill a Mockingbird in 1960. The novel gives the opportunity to teach about for example: language aspects, symbolism, culture, geography, history, family values, and moral questions. Why is To Kill a Mockingbird a suitable novel to use in the teaching, and how can it be used? are the questions to be answered in this essay. The project is aimed for Upper Secondary students, or adults. Chapter one is a theoretical chapter that deals with what other people have said about using literature in the classroom. What can one gain from reading, especially novels? It will also discuss the teacher’s role in choosing literature. As a part of chapter two the questions why To Kill a Mockingbird is a suitable novel to use in the classroom, and what to teach from the novel will be addressed. Moreover there are certain features that both teachers and pupils need to be aware of, as well as understand in order to get the most out of To Kill a Mockingbird. These will be explained in chapter two. The third chapter is a description of how To Kill a Mockingbird can be used in the teaching, providing exercises that reach over eight sessions.
