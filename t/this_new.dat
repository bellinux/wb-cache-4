5|$|The Chicken Big King {{was added}} April 2014. <b>This</b> <b>new</b> {{variation}} on the original Big King sandwich {{was part of a}} corporate menu restructuring that began the previous year. This was part of Burger King CEO Alex Macedo's plan to introduce simpler products that require few or no new ingredients in order to simplify operations. <b>This</b> <b>new</b> sandwich uses the company's existing Crispy Chicken Jr patty in place of the beef and adds an extra layer of King sauce to ensure that the product stays moist.|$|E
5|$|The {{catalytic}} subunit α {{of protein}} kinase A {{is a key}} regulatory enzyme that in humans is encoded by the PRKACA gene. They named <b>this</b> <b>new</b> enzyme the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and proceeded to purify and characterize <b>this</b> <b>new</b> enzyme. Fischer and Krebs won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1992 for this discovery and their continued work on kinases, and their counterparts the protein phosphatases. Today, this cAMP-dependent protein kinase is more simply noted as PKA.|$|E

5|$|A {{major step}} forward {{in the study of}} {{bacteria}} came in 1977 when Carl Woese recognised that archaea have a separate line of evolutionary descent from bacteria. <b>This</b> <b>new</b> phylogenetic taxonomy depended on the sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA, and divided prokaryotes into two evolutionary domains, as part of the three-domain system.|$|E

The first edition of <b>this</b> <b>new</b> series, dated March 1948 but released in May, included a heated condemnation of the Indonesian leadership for perceived unwillingness to deal with the suffering which occurred during the occupation. <b>This</b> <b>new</b> publication, which Jassin described as unoriginal, ceased in 1954. It was later replaced by Konfrontasi, led by Alisjahbana, which published bi-monthly from 1954 until 1962.|$|E

The airline took its first delivery of <b>this</b> <b>new</b> aircraft in September 2004, with the eighth and final aircraft delivered on 22 June 2006.

He continued his role as an occasional punt returner with 24 returns. Allison also continued to contribute defensively, playing in all 16 regular season games and recording an interception and fumble recovery.|$|E

5|$|Early work on <b>this</b> <b>new</b> {{category}} of nova was performed during the 1930s by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky at Mount Wilson Observatory. They identified SAndromedae, {{what they considered}} a typical supernova, as an explosive event that released radiation approximately equal to the Sun's total energy output for 107 years. They decided to call <b>this</b> <b>new</b> class of cataclysmic variables super-novae, and postulated that the energy was generated by the gravitational collapse of ordinary stars into neutron stars. The name super-novae was first used in a 1931 lecture at Caltech by Zwicky, then used publicly in 1933 {{at a meeting of}} the American Physical Society. By 1938, the hyphen had been lost and the modern name was in use.|$|E

The answers can be found either in possible collective actions, or in individual duties.|$|E
