5|$|A small, fast-swimming predator, the blacknose shark feeds {{primarily}} on small, bony fishes, including pinfish, croakers, porgies, anchovies, spiny boxfish, and porcupinefish, {{as well as}} on octopus and other cephalopods. When competing for bait, <b>their</b> <b>speed</b> allows them to snatch food from larger sharks such as the Caribbean reef shark (C. perezi). This species may form large schools that are sometimes associated with anchovies and mullet. Blacknose sharks demonstrate a high degree of philopatry: both juveniles and adults have been documented returning to the same local area year after year.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{whales are}} not easy to catch or kill. <b>Their</b> <b>speed</b> and power meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead {{targeted}} sperm and right whales. In 1864, the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with harpoons specifically designed for catching large whales. The harpoon gun was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, but Foyn perfected it, and soon several whaling stations were established on the coast of Finnmark in northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.|$|E

5|$|Missouri Fox Trotters {{are used}} {{extensively}} by trail riders, who appreciate their gaits, stamina and weight-carrying abilities. They {{are also used}} in handicapped riding programs, and their smooth gait has proven useful for riders with minor physical disabilities. Crosses between Fox Trotter mares and donkey jacks are often made, creating mules with the fox trot gait {{that are used to}} carry hunters and trail riders, especially in the western United States. The US Forest Service also employs Fox Trotters for <b>their</b> <b>speed,</b> stamina and gait, and members of the breed were used to make the first horse-back descent of the north rim of the Grand Canyon.|$|E
5|$|The {{class had}} greatly {{improved}} handling characteristics over the preceding Nassau class. The Helgolands were much better sea boats {{and did not}} suffer from the severe rolling that the Nassaus did. The ships were responsive to the helm, and had a tight turning radius, and lost only minimal speed during swells. The ships lost up to 54% of <b>their</b> <b>speed</b> at hard rudder, and would heel up to 7°. For comparison, the earlier Nassaus lost up to 70% speed and held a 12° heel with the rudder hard over.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} {{reactivated}} {{for a number}} of ceremonial duties in the late 1880s, including for the dedication of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal in June 1887 and a tour of the Baltic by the recently crowned Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1888. In the 1890s, all four ships returned to active service with the fleet, serving in the I Division until the middle of the decade, when the new s began entering service. The four Sachsens were then displaced to the II Division. In the late 1890s, all four of the ships were extensively reconstructed; their secondary armament was modernized and their propulsion systems were rebuilt with new machinery, which increased <b>their</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E

50|$|All heavy {{vehicles}} in Europe and New Zealand have law/by-law governors that limits <b>their</b> <b>speeds</b> to 90 km/h or 100 km/h. Fire engines and other emergency vehicles {{are exempt from}} this requirement.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{of these}} devices are also {{equipped}} with a [...] "lockup" [...] mechanism which rigidly binds the engine to the transmission when <b>their</b> <b>speeds</b> are nearly equal, to avoid slippage and a resulting loss of efficiency.|$|R
5|$|Both species {{walk with}} a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass {{with the body}} held {{horizontal}} and laterally flattened. When disturbed, they typically fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then go into a crouch. In short grass, they can escape from a dog using <b>their</b> <b>speed</b> and maneuverability, running with the body held almost horizontal. The typical flight is weak and fluttering, especially that of the African crake, but for longer flights, such as migration, the corn crake has a steadier, stronger action with its legs drawn up. Flocks of up to 40 corn crakes may form on migration, sometimes associating with common quails. Migration takes place at night, and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites. The ability to migrate is innate, not learned from adults; chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate to Africa and return with similar success to wild-bred young.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy VI is menu-based, {{in which}} the player selects an action {{from a list of}} such options as Fight, Magic, and Item. A maximum of four {{characters}} may be used in battles, which are based on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV. Under this system, each character has an action bar that replenishes itself at a rate dependent on <b>their</b> <b>speed</b> statistic. When a character's action bar is filled, the player may assign an action. In addition to standard battle techniques, each character possesses a unique special ability. For example, Locke possesses the ability to steal items from enemies, while Celes' Runic ability allows her to absorb most magical attacks cast until her next turn.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds will rob other seabirds such as boobies, {{particularly}} the red-footed booby, tropicbirds, shearwaters, petrels, terns, gulls and even ospreys of their catch, using <b>their</b> <b>speed</b> and manoeuvrability to outrun and harass their victims until they regurgitate their stomach contents. They may either assail their targets {{after they have}} caught their food or circle high over seabird colonies waiting for parent birds to return laden with food. Although frigatebirds are renowned for their kleptoparasitic feeding behaviour, kleptoparasitism is not thought to play {{a significant part of}} the diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%.|$|E

5|$|Horse {{improvement}} as a goal, {{and horse}} breeding as an enterprise, date to medieval times; King John imported a hundred Flemish stallions, Edward III imported fifty Spanish stallions, and various priories and abbeys owned stud farms. Laws were passed restricting and prohibiting horse exports {{and for the}} culling of horses considered undesirable in type. By the 17th century, specific horse breeds were being recorded as suitable for specific purposes, and new horse-drawn agricultural machinery was being designed. Fast coaches pulled by teams of horses with Thoroughbred blood could make use of improved roads, and coaching inn proprietors owned hundreds of horses to support the trade. Steam power took {{over the role of}} horses in agriculture from the mid-19th century, but horses continued to be used in warfare for almost another 100 years, as <b>their</b> <b>speed</b> and agility over rough terrain remained unequalled. Working horses had all but disappeared from Britain by the 1980s, and today horses in Britain are kept almost wholly for recreational purposes.|$|E
5|$|Most vertebrates—the amphibians, the {{reptiles}} {{and some}} mammals such as humans and bears—are plantigrade, {{walking on the}} whole of the underside of the foot. Many mammals, such as cats and dogs, are digitigrade, walking on their toes, the greater stride length allowing more speed. Digitigrade mammals are also often adept at quiet movement. Some animals such as horses are unguligrade, walking on the tips of their toes. This even further increases their stride length and thus <b>their</b> <b>speed.</b> A few mammals, namely the great apes, are also known to walk on their knuckles, at least for their front legs. Giant anteaters and platypuses are also knuckle-walkers. Some mammals are bipeds, using only two limbs for locomotion, which can be seen in, for example, humans and the great apes. Bipedal species have a larger field of vision than quadrupeds, conserve more energy and have the ability to manipulate objects with their hands, which aids in foraging. Instead of walking, some bipeds hop, such as kangaroos and kangaroo rats.|$|E
5|$|Norway sent {{a strong}} {{contingent}} with four jumpers {{able to win}} the event, including reigning Olympic and world champion Jacob Tullin Thams. Andersen had won all eight Norwegian qualification events. World record holder Nels Nelsen from Canada was not permitted to participate due to financial problems. Japan participated in an international ski jumping competition for the first time, also becoming the first Asian country to do so. After the first jump, three Norwegians were in the lead. A 40-minute discussion erupted regarding the speed, with Central European jumpers wanting it increased. This was complied with by the jury, resulting in falls by several favorites, including the most vocal speed increase proponents, Gérard Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani. Andersen and Ruud won by reducing <b>their</b> <b>speed</b> on the in-run.|$|E

5|$|Players {{can choose}} from a cast of 20 playable drivers divided in 10 pairs. All of the {{characters}} have their own special items which are unique to them, like Mario and Luigi with Fireballs, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong with Giant Bananas, Bowser and Bowser Jr. with Bowser Shells, Yoshi and Birdo with Eggs, Peach and Daisy with Hearts, Wario and Waluigi with Bob-ombs, Koopa Troopa (who previously appeared in Super Mario Kart) and Paratroopa with Triple Shells, Toad and Toadette with Golden Mushrooms, and Baby Mario and Baby Luigi with Chain Chomps. Petey Piranha and King Boo have the unique ability to use {{any of the other}} characters' special items excluding Luigi's Green Fireball and Birdo's Pink Egg. There are 21 karts in all and the character's weight class (light, middle, or heavy) determines the kart in which they can ride as well as <b>their</b> <b>speed,</b> acceleration, and weight attributes.|$|E
5|$|Slalom is a single-player game {{in which}} players race {{downhill}} {{in a series of}} slalom races. There are 24downhill runs total that are evenly spread across three mountains. Before the game starts, players choose their mountain based on difficulty: Snowy Hill for beginners, Steep Peak for intermediate players, and Mount Nasty for experts. The goal for each run is to reach the finish line within the allotted time. Players must dodge obstacles including trees, flags, snowmen, sledders, and other skiers on their way downhill, or else they will tumble and lose time. With enough momentum, players can jump over these obstacles. Players must ski around flags to maintain <b>their</b> <b>speed.</b> If they ski {{on the wrong side of}} the flag, the racer will snowplow and slow down.|$|E
5|$|The Earp party rode {{north to}} the Percy Ranch, but were not welcomed by Hugh and Jim Percy, who feared the Cowboys; after a meal and some rest, they left around 3:00 {{in the morning of}} March 27. The Earp party slipped into the area near Tombstone and met with supporters, {{including}} Hairlip Charlie Smith and Warren Earp. On March 27, the posse arrived at the Sierra Bonita Ranch owned by Henry Hooker, a wealthy and prominent rancher. That night, Dan Tipton caught the first stage out of Tombstone and headed for Benson, carrying $1,000 from mining owner and Earp supporter E. B. Gage for the posse. Hooker congratulated Earp on the killing of Curly Bill. Hooker fed them and Wyatt told him he wanted to buy new mounts. Hooker was known for his purebred stallions and ran over 500 brood mares that produced horses that became known for <b>their</b> <b>speed,</b> beauty, and temperament. He provided Wyatt and his posse with new mounts, but refused to take Wyatt's money. When Behan's posse was observed in the distance, Hooker suggested Wyatt make his stand there, but Wyatt moved into the hills about three miles (5km) distant near Reilly Hill.|$|E
