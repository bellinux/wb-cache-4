40|$|There {{are many}} {{critical}} concerns (including <b>the</b> accounting for <b>endogeneity)</b> {{when one is}} properly estimating response functions. However, it is sometimes (certainly not always) better to leave some variables exogenous when building mathematical models intended to help decision makers.

As opposed to the test based on the IVQR estimator of Chernozhukov and Hansen (2006) in the case of {{more than a couple of}} variables, our approach does not imply an infeasible computation time.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{consider}} potential endogeneity, I borrow an estimated RTA coefficient from Egger et al.

This specification is the benchmark of my analysis. In the benchmark scenario, the trade cost coefficients other than RTAs are estimated using observed 2012 data when constraining RTA for potential endogeneity. This procedure ensures that I fit the model to the 2012 baseline data while accounting for <b>the</b> potential <b>endogeneity</b> of RTAs. Also In addition, to check robustness, I also constrain the estimated RTA coefficients from Head and Mayer (2014) in the preliminary step of the baseline gravity estimation.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>endogeneity</b> {{problem is}} {{particularly}} relevant {{in the context}} of time series analysis of causal processes. It is common for some factors within a causal system to be dependent for their value in period t on the values of other factors in the causal system in period t &minus; 1. Suppose that the level of pest infestation is independent of all other factors within a given period, but is influenced by the level of rainfall and fertilizer in the preceding period. In this instance it would be correct to say that infestation is exogenous within the period, but endogenous over time.|$|E

This test {{can be used to}} check for <b>the</b> <b>endogeneity</b> of a {{variable}} (by comparing instrumental variable (IV) estimates to ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates). It {{can also be used to}} check the validity of extra instruments by comparing IV estimates using a full set of instruments Z to IV estimates that use a proper subset of Z. Note that in order for the test to work in the latter case, we must be certain of the validity of the subset of Z and that subset must have enough instruments to identify the parameters of the equation.|$|E
50|$|The intuition {{behind the}} RDD is well {{illustrated}} using {{the evaluation of}} merit-based scholarships. The main problem with estimating the causal effect of such an intervention is <b>the</b> <b>endogeneity</b> of performance to the assignment of treatment (e.g. scholarship award): Since high-performing {{students are more likely}} to be awarded the merit scholarship and continue performing well at the same time, comparing the outcomes of awardees and non-recipients would lead to an upward bias of the estimates. Even if the scholarship did not improve grades at all, awardees would have performed better than non-recipients, simply because scholarships were given to students who were performing well ex ante.|$|E

5000|$|Selection bias, {{a special}} case of confounding, occurs where {{intervention}} participants are non-randomly drawn from the beneficiary population, and the criteria determining selection are correlated with outcomes. Unobserved factors, which are associated with access to or participation in the intervention, and are causally related to the outcome of interest, {{may lead to a}} spurious relationship between intervention and outcome if unaccounted for. Self-selection occurs where, for example, more able or organized individuals or communities, who {{are more likely to have}} better outcomes of interest, are also more likely to participate in the intervention. Endogenous program selection occurs where individuals or communities are chosen to participate because they are seen to be more likely to benefit from the intervention. Ignoring confounding factors can lead to a problem of omitted variable bias. In the special case of selection bias, <b>the</b> <b>endogeneity</b> of the selection variables can cause simultaneity bias.|$|E
50|$|The legal origins theory {{claims that}} the two main legal traditions or origins, civil law and common law, crucially shape lawmaking and dispute {{adjudication}} and have not been reformed after the initial exogenous transplantation by Europeans. Therefore, they affect economic outcomes to date. According to the evidence reported by the initial proponents of such a theory, countries that received civil law would display today less secure investor rights, stricter regulation, and more inefficient governments and courts than those that inherited common law. These differences would reflect both a stronger historical emphasis of common law on private ordering and the higher adaptability of judge-made law. Recent contributions however have criticized the idea that transplanted legal institutions remained intact and have documented that indeed they evolve moved by how each country solves the trade-off between the uncertainty of judge-made law and the bias possibly injected into civil law by inefficient political institutions. Crucially, these latest studies show that considering both <b>the</b> <b>endogeneity</b> between legal traditions and {{the economy and the}} evolution of legal systems over time implies that civil law can often economically dominate common law.|$|E
5000|$|A 2008 study {{finds that}} the rates of crimes {{committed}} by immigrants are substantially higher than nationals.

In the case of nationals, their contribution to the increase in the crime rate is primarily concentrated in offences against persons." [...] By controlling for socioeconomic and demographic factors, the gap between immigrants and natives is reduced but not fully. The authors also find [...] "that a higher proportions of American, non-UE European, and African immigrants tend to widen the crime differential, the effect being larger for the latter ones". The same paper provides supports for the notion that labour market conditions impact the relationship between crime and immigration. Cultural differences were also statistically detected.

5000|$|In one trial {{subjects}} were asked to drive go-karts around a track under various conditions. It was found that subjects who started driving unbelted drove consistently faster when subsequently belted. [...] Similarly, a study of habitual non-seatbelt wearers driving in freeway conditions found evidence that they had adapted to seatbelt use by adopting higher driving speeds and closer following distances. A 2001 analysis of US crash data aimed to establish the effects of seatbelt legislation on driving fatalities and found that previous estimates of seatbelts effectiveness had been significantly overstated. According to the analysis used, seatbelts were claimed to have decreased fatalities by 1.35% for each 10% increase in seatbelt use. The study controlled for endogenous motivations of seat belt use, which it is claimed creates an artificial correlation between seat belt use and fatalities, leading to the conclusion that seatbelts cause fatalities. For example, drivers in high risk areas are more likely to use seat belts, {{and are more likely to}} be in accidents, creating a non-causal correlation between seatbelt use and mortality. After accounting for <b>the</b> <b>endogeneity</b> of seatbelt usage, Cohen and Einav found no evidence that the risk compensation effect makes seatbelt wearing drivers more dangerous, a finding at variance with other research.|$|E

40|$|The {{endogenous}} money theory {{constitutes the}} core {{element of the}} post-keynesian monetary theory. The first formulation of this theory {{can be found in}} the works of Kaldor published in the 1970 s. Taking these studies as a starting point, the post-keynesians elaborated two versions of the endogenous money theory which differ in their assumptions about the behaviour of the monetary authorities and the banking system, and hence offer different conclusions about the slope of the money supply curve. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the importance of the endogenous money theory using a criterion which can be defined on the basis of Keynesâs distinction between a real exchange economy and a monetary economy. As is well known, Keynes (1933 a, 1933 b) uses the former term to refer to an economy in which money is merely a tool to reduce the cost of exchange and whose presence does not alter the structure of the economic system, which remains substantially a barter economy. A monetary economy instead refers to an economic system in which the presence of fiat money radically changes the nature of exchange and the characteristics of the production process. Keynes (1933 a, p. 410) notes that the classical economists formulated an explanation of how the real-exchange economy works, convinced that this explanation could be easily applied to a monetary economy. He believed that this conviction was unfounded and stressed the need to elaborate a âmonetary theory of production, to supplement the realâexchange theories which we already possessâ (Keynes, 1933 a, p. 411). The specification of the elements determining the non-neutrality of money is thus the key factor differentiating Keynesâs theory from the classical one. 1 The criterion used to evaluate the significance of the endogenous money theory is whether it enables us to elaborate on and to broaden the explanation of the justification the nonneutrality of money formulated by Keynes. In The General Theory the reasons for the non-neutrality of money are grounded in the store of wealth function of money; the liquidity preference theory is the element on which the keynesian explanation of income fluctuation is based. The importance of <b>the</b> money <b>endogeneity</b> theory can therefore be assessed in relation to its ability to specify determinant factors for the non-neutrality of money that have not been highlighted by the liquidity preference theory; in other words, the significance of the endogenous money theory depends on its capacity to bring out elements of a monetary economy that have been overlooked in the liquidity preference theory. This paper presents the following results. First of all, it shows that the endogenous money theory makes it possible to extend the analysis of the factors accounting for the non-neutrality of money beyond what Keynes has done in The General Theory; in particular this paper argues that the theory of money endogeneity obtains this result by underlying the means of payment function of money. Second, the work shows that <b>the</b> money <b>endogeneity</b> theory gives credence to certain points developed by Keynes in some works published in 1933 and between 1937 and 1939. Third, the work emphasises that the novel aspects of <b>the</b> money <b>endogeneity</b> theory do not depend on the particular version of this theory, i. e. they do not depend on the slope of the credit supply curve. Finally, in the paper the most significant aspects of <b>the</b> money <b>endogeneity</b> theory are presented by means of a theoretical model that distinguishes clearly between the credit market and the money market. It is shown that an important element of <b>the</b> money <b>endogeneity</b> theory is that it elaborates an alternative credit theory to the neoclassical one. The paper is divided into three parts. In the first one, the most relevant aspects of <b>the</b> money <b>endogeneity</b> theory are presented starting from Kaldorâs work, and we bring out the consistency between that theory and the considerations formulated by Keynes in some writings which preceded and followed the publication of The General Theory. In the second part the two versions of <b>the</b> money <b>endogeneity</b> theory are analysed and it is noted that the debate between the supporters of these two versions risks overshadowing the innovative aspects of <b>the</b> money <b>endogeneity</b> theory that do not depend on the slope of the credit and money supply curves. Then in the third part, the aspects that distinguish a monetary economy from a real-exchange economy and that emerge because of <b>the</b> money <b>endogeneity</b> theory are described. ...|$|R
