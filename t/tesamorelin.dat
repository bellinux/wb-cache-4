50|$|<b>Tesamorelin</b> (INN) (trade name Egrifta) is a {{synthetic}} form of growth-hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) {{which is used}} in the treatment of HIV-associated lipodystrophy. It is produced and developed by Theratechnologies, Inc. of Canada. The drug is {{a synthetic}} peptide consisting of all 44 amino acids of human GHRH {{with the addition of a}} trans-3-hexenoic acid group.|$|E
5000|$|Many GHRH analogs remain {{primarily}} research chemicals, {{although some}} have specific applications. Sermorelin, a functional peptide fragment of GHRH, {{has been used}} in the diagnosis of deficiencies in growth hormone secretion. [...] <b>Tesamorelin,</b> under the trade name Egrifta, received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in 2010 for the treatment of lipodystrophy in HIV patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy, and, in 2011, was investigated for effects on certain cognitive tests in the elderly. As a category, the use of GHRH analogs by professional athletes may be prohibited by restrictions on doping in sport because they act as growth hormone secretagogues.|$|E
50|$|Growth hormone secretagogues (GSHs) are a {{class of}} drugs which act as secretagogues (i.e., induce the secretion) of growth hormone (GH). They include {{agonists}} of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), such as ghrelin (lenomorelin), pralmorelin (GHRP-2), GHRP-6, examorelin (hexarelin), ipamorelin, and ibutamoren (MK-677), and agonists of the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR), such as growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) (somatorelin), CJC-1295, sermorelin, and <b>tesamorelin.</b> Many also induce the secretion of {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1), as well as of other hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as prolactin and cortisol. The main clinical application of these agents is the treatment of growth hormone deficiency. They also see black market use, similarly to anabolic steroids, for bodybuilding purposes.|$|E
40|$|FDA Approved Indications: <b>Tesamorelin</b> is {{a growth}} hormone {{releasing}} factor (GRF) analog indicated for {{the reduction of}} excess abdominal fat in HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy. 1 Background/Reason for Review: Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) taking antiretroviral therapy frequently develop increased visceral adiposity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance, which {{may be associated with}} increased cardiovascular risk. Studies have shown that growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) has shown positive changes in fat distribution in HIV-infected patients. 1, 2 <b>Tesamorelin</b> is a synthetic growth hormone-releasing factor analog that has been approved for the use of HIV infected patients with lipodystrophy. This review will evaluate the available evidence of efficacy, safety, and tolerability to further define its role in therapy and to identify potential parameters for use. Issues/Key questions: Is <b>tesamorelin</b> effective and safe for the treatment of excess abdominal fat in HIV-infected patients? Does treatment with <b>tesamorelin</b> result in improved health outcomes? Efficacy: There were two, Phase 3, randomized, controlled studies that evaluated the efficacy of <b>tesamorelin</b> compared to placebo; both studies conducted an initial 26 -week phase and a 26 -week extension phase to evaluate long-term safety. 7 - 9 Both studies saw a significant change in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in patients treated with <b>tesamorelin</b> (- 15. 2 % and- 10. 9 %) compared to placebo (+ 5. 0 % and- 0. 6 %, p< 0. 001 for both trials). Secondary efficacy endpoints from the extension phases indicate that this decrease in VAT is not maintained after treatment discontinuation. There was limited reduction in body mass index or waist circumference after 26 weeks after treatment with <b>tesamorelin...</b>|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether <b>tesamorelin,</b> a stabilized growth hormone-releasing hormone analogue, would alter insulin sensitivity or control of diabetes. A 12 -week randomized, placebo-controlled study of 53 patients with type 2 diabetes. Three treatment groups: placebo, 1 and 2 mg <b>tesamorelin.</b> Fasting glucose, glucose and insulin from oral glucose tolerance test, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c), home blood glucose, insulin-like growth factor- 1, and lipids. Relative insulin response following oral ingestion of glucose. No significant differences were observed between groups in relative insulin response over the 12 -week treatment period. At Week 12, fasting glucose, HbA 1 c and overall diabetes control were not significantly different between groups. In addition, relevant modifications in diabetes medications were similar between groups. Total cholesterol (- 0. 3 ± 0. 6 mmol/L) and non-HDL cholesterol (- 0. 3 ± 0. 5 mmol/L) significantly decreased from baseline to Week 12 in the <b>tesamorelin</b> 2 mg group (p< 0. 05 vs. placebo).

40|$|Metabolic and morphologic {{abnormalities}} {{in persons}} with HIV remain common contributors to stigma and morbidity. Increased abdominal circumference and visceral adiposity were first {{recognized in the}} late 1990 s, soon after the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy. Visceral adiposity is commonly associated with metabolic abnormalities including low HDL- cholesterol, raised triglycerides, insulin resistance and hypertension, a constellation of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus known as the metabolic syndrome. Medline and conference abstracts were searched to identify clinical research on factors associated with visceral adiposity and randomized studies of management approaches. Data were critically reviewed by physicians familiar with the field. A range of host and lifestyle factors, as well as antiretroviral drug choice, were associated with increased visceral adiposity. Management approaches included treatment switching. Supraphysiological doses of recombinant HGH and the hGHRH <b>tesamorelin</b> both significantly and selectively reduce visceral fat over 12 - 24 weeks; however, the benefits are only maintained if dosing is continued. In summary, the prevention and management of visceral adiposity remains a substantial challenge in clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|Treatment {{with highly}} active {{antiretroviral}} drugs (HAART) {{is associated with}} several endocrine and metabolic comorbidities. Pituitary growth hormone (GH) secretion seems to be altered in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and about one-third of patients have biochemical GH deficiency (GHD). We undertake a historical review of {{the functioning of the}} GH/insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) axis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and provide an overview of the main changes of the GH/IGF- 1 axis occurring today in patients with HIV. Both spontaneous GH secretion and GH response to provocative stimuli are reduced in patients with HIV infection, especially in those with HIV-related lipodystrophy. The role of fat accumulation on flattened GH secretion is discussed, together with all factors able to potentially interfere with the pituitary secretion of GH. Several factors {{contribute to the development of}} GHD, but the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in the genesis of GHD are complex and not yet fully elucidated owing to the difficulty in separating the effects of HIV infection from those of HAART, comorbidities and body changes. An update on the putative mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of altered GH secretion in these patients is provided, together with an overview on the therapeutic strategies targeting the GH/IGF- 1 axis to counteract fat redistribution associated with HIV-related lipodystrophy. The clinical significance of GHD in the context of HIV infection is discussed. The administration of <b>tesamorelin,</b> a GH releasing hormone analogue, is effective in reducing visceral fat in HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy. This treatment is promising and safer than treatment with high doses of recombinant human growth hormone, which has several side-effects...|$|E
40|$|Landmark {{advances}} {{in the field of}} synthetic protein chemistry have enabled the preparation of complex, homogeneous proteins, including those that carry specific posttranslational modifications (PTMs). In addition, chemical synthesis will allow one to incorporate unnatural elements to generate new biologics with altered properties and functions. Native chemical ligation (NCL) is a milestone in the chemical synthesis of proteins (Kent et al., Science, 1994, 266, 776 - 779), in which a C-terminal peptide thioester and an N-terminal cysteine (Cys) -containing peptide-both in side-chain unprotected forms-are selectively coupled to generate a natural peptidic linkage at the site of ligation. This method requires a cysteine at the optimal convergent ligation site. However, Cys is one of the least abundant amino acids in natural proteins. Therefore, the development of new ligation methods at other amino acids will be necessary and important in this regard. Along these lines, our laboratory has developed a novel thiol-independent approach-serine/threonine ligation (STL). It uses the N-terminal serine or threonine of a peptide segment to chemoselectively react with another peptide segment with a C-terminal salicylaldehyde ester to form an N,O-benzylidene acetal linked product, followed by acidolysis to afford the final product at the natural Ser/Thr site. To extend the application of STL in chemical protein synthesis, we have developed a robust method for the preparation of peptide salicylaldehyde esters via Fmoc-based solid phase peptide synthesis. Furthermore, we have successfully applied this ligation method in the convergent synthesis of peptide drugs of significant therapeutic importance, including Teriparatide (Forteo), Corticorelin (oCRH), Exenatide (Byetta) and <b>Tesamorelin</b> (hGHRH). Of significance, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our STL in the assembly of a more complex target of biological interest: human erythrocyte acylphosphatase (~ 11 kDa). In summary, we have developed a new serine/threonine ligation, which can be effectively used to synthesize peptides and proteins. As there are countless serine and threonine residues in natural proteins, particularly those carrying posttranslational modifications, this method is anticipated to offer new opportunities in synthetic protein chemistry and chemical biology. published_or_final_versionChemistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
