2500|$|A tight {{lower bound}} {{is not known}} {{on the number of}} {{required}} additions, although lower bounds have been proved under some restrictive assumptions on the algorithms. In 1973, Morgenstern proved an Ω(NlogN) lower bound on the addition count for algorithms where the multiplicative constants have bounded magnitudes (which is true for most but not all FFT algorithms). This result, however, applies only to the unnormalized Fourier transform (which is a scaling of a unitary matrix by a factor of [...] ), and does not explain why the Fourier matrix is harder to compute than any other unitary matrix (including the identity matrix) [...] under the same scaling. Pan (1986) proved an Ω(NlogN) lower bound assuming a bound on a measure of the FFT algorithm's [...] "asynchronicity", but the generality of this assumption is unclear. For the case of power-of-two N, Papadimitriou (1979) argued that the number [...] of complex-number additions achieved by Cooley–Tukey algorithms is optimal under certain assumptions on the graph of the algorithm (his assumptions imply, among other things, that no additive identities in the roots of unity are exploited). (This argument would imply that at least [...] real additions are required, although this is not a <b>tight</b> <b>bound</b> because extra additions are required as part of complex-number multiplications.) Thus far, no published FFT algorithm has achieved fewer than [...] complex-number additions (or their equivalent) for power-of-twoN.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a self-consistent theoretical framework {{associated with the}} Schwinger unitary operators whose basic mathematical rules embrace a new uncertainty principle that generalizes and strengthens the Massar-Spindel inequality. Among other remarkable virtues, this quantum-algebraic approach exhibits a sound connection with the Wiener-Kinchin theorem for signal processing, which permits us to determine an effective <b>tighter</b> <b>bound</b> that not only imposes a new subtle set of restrictions upon the selective process of signals and wavelets bases, but also represents an important complement for property testing of unitary operators. Moreover, we establish a hierarchy of <b>tighter</b> <b>bounds,</b> which interpolates between the <b>tightest</b> <b>bound</b> and the Massar-Spindel inequality, {{as well as its}} respective link with the discrete Weyl function and tomographic reconstructions of finite quantum states. We also show how the Harper Hamiltonian and discrete Fourier operators can be combined to construct finite ground states which yield the <b>tightest</b> <b>bound</b> of a given finite-dimensional state vector space. Such results touch on some fundamental questions inherent to quantum mechanics and their implications in quantum information theory. Comment: 31 pages, 3 figures, comments welcom...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a novel approach}} to find a <b>tighter</b> <b>bound</b> of {{the transformation of the}} Min-Max problems into the one of Least-Square Estimation. It is well known that the above transformation of one problem to the other can lead to the proof that their target functions linearly bound each other. However, this linear bound is not a tight one. In this paper, we prove that if we transform the Min-Max problem into two Least-Square Estimation problems, where one minimizes the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) of the original function and the other one minimizes the RMS of the difference between the original function and an arbitrary constant, one can obtain a <b>tighter</b> <b>bound</b> between their target functions. The <b>tighter</b> <b>bound</b> given by this novel approach depends on the outcome of the second Least-Square Estimation problem, so there is a great incentive to choose the arbitrary constant which gives the smallest RMS of the second Least-Square Estimation problem. For a problem with a large number of variables, this novel <b>tighter</b> <b>bound</b> can be two to three order tighter than the old one.
