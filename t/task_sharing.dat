40|$|Older {{adults in}} need of {{long-term}} care often receive help from both informal and formal caregivers. The division of tasks between these different types of caregivers may vary among such mixed care networks. Traditional models of task division suggest that formal and informal caregivers may either supplement each other or specialise in the care activities performed. Our study explores the determinants of various forms of task division in the Netherlands, using data collected in 2007 on 458 mixed care situations. Four types of task divisions of informal and formal care are distinguished: the complementation model [neither Activities of Daily Living (ADL) nor instrumental ADL (IADL) <b>tasks</b> <b>shared,</b> 14 %], the supplementation model (both ADL and IADL <b>tasks</b> <b>shared,</b> 39 %) and informal and formal specialisation (one type of <b>task</b> <b>shared,</b> one type of <b>task</b> not <b>shared,</b> 27 % and 20 % respectively). Marginal effects calculated with multinomial regression analyses show that the intensity of care provision, the informal caregivers' motives {{and the presence of}} privately paid help - more than care receiver's health - are related to type of task division with formal care. For example, when the informal caregiver provides more hours of help and out of a strong personal bond, the likelihood of informal specialisation increases, whereas the likelihood of formal specialisation decreases. When privately paid help is present, the complementation model is more likely, whereas the supplementation model is less likely to be found. Results are discussed regarding the differential consequences for co-ordination and co-operation in mixed care networks. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R
50|$|In February 1980 the Commandant of the Marine Corps and the Chief of Naval Operations {{revised the}} {{operational}} <b>task</b> <b>sharing</b> between both referring {{branches of the}} armed forces in a memorandum. Hitherto the USMC had a supporting role within the United States Naval Forces Europe (NAVEUR). When that agreement came into effect on July 1, 1980, Headquarters, Fleet Marine Force Europe, the predecessor of the present unit, was founded in London including an independent 40-person staff as a Designed Component Command, to act as a Command Unit for further formations to be put under EUCOM-Command in case of a crisis situation. That staff immediately began preparing operation plans for optimal replenishment and deployment when required. FMF Europe arranged Marine support for Operation Provide Comfort, Operation Provide Promise, and Operation Deny Flight. To match increasing challenges better, headquarters were transferred to Böblingen near Stuttgart on November 8, 1993. In February 1994 the headquarters was renamed MARFOREUR.|$|E
50|$|Today GHRSST {{is a truly}} {{international}} {{project with}} over $24 Million US invested across all of the project activities. A basic 'version-1.0' of the GHRSST Regional/Global <b>Task</b> <b>Sharing</b> (R/GTS) system has been implemented in an internationally distributed manner. Global and regional coverage SST data products are now produced by RDAC in the USA, Australia, France, Japan, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Italy and Canada. Products are passed in near real time to a recently operational GDAC at NASA JPL, USA. Research and development within GHRSST projects continue to tackle the problems of diurnal variability, skin temperature deviations and SST validation. Data management teams continue to refine the GHRSST data management structures to provide a functional system that conforms to federal directives (e.g., ISO, FGDC, INSPIRE). A Long Term Data Stewardship and Reanalysis Facility (http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/SatelliteData/ghrsst/ LTSRF) is operated by the NOAA National Center for Environmental Information {{in collaboration with the}} JPL GDAC (http://ghrsst.jpl.nasa.gov). The GHRSST-PP International Project Office, jointly funded by the European Space Agency and Met Office, UK, continues to manage the international co-ordination of the project.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} interpretation <b>task</b> <b>sharing</b> between the central server and the remote wearable ECG recorder. Adaptive <b>task</b> <b>sharing</b> is presented {{as an alternative to}} the remote embedded and to the centralized interpretation commonly used today. The patient-dependent adaptation of the <b>task</b> <b>sharing</b> needs an extreme care, since it is advantageous only if based on medically justified rules. Three procedures are involved in optimization and control of the task sharing: human expert-derived diagnosis priority, statistic-based automatic assessment of result reliability and machine estimation of remote resources availability. The paper discusses these procedures and their impact to the distant interpretation performance and diagnosis reliability. Presented approach was designed and programmed in C++ language and consists an integral part of distributed architecture of the ECG interpretive software. The prototype implemented in the PDA-based ECG monitor and the stationary server enabled the assessment of the <b>task</b> <b>sharing</b> correctness for standard test signals. With the promising results achieved with the prototype we plan to transfer the <b>task</b> <b>sharing</b> rules to a multithreaded mansupervised server.

This study was designed to assess the effect of <b>task</b> <b>sharing,</b> mutually between midwives and Family Health Workforces (FHWs), on the number of needed staff across the Iranian Health Posts. Methods The workload and required number of midwives and FHWs in a Health Post were calculated and compared in two different scenarios of task division using a combined approach for estimating the number of required staff. In the first scenario, the midwives and FHWs provide their specialized services and in the second one, using mutual <b>task</b> <b>sharing,</b> a midwife provides all services traditionally delivered by FHWs and each FHW provides prenatal care in addition to the special tasks. Sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate the effects of different hypotheses.
