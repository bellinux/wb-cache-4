5|$|A {{major issue}} in her initial {{election}} was whether the <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> would vote to override President George W. Bush's veto of {{an expansion of the}} State Children's Health Insurance Program. Tsongas said she would vote to override, and it was reported Ogonowski would uphold the veto. Hours after being sworn into office on October 18, Tsongas voted to override, but the vote failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to London from Wallsend, {{he attended a}} full meeting of Labour MPs to decide who would become the Party Chairman. This effectively meant choosing the leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, because Labour was the largest opposition party in the House of Commons. The <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> were Ramsay MacDonald and J. R. Clynes, and Hastings, who supported MacDonald, persuaded six new MPs to support him. MacDonald was elected {{by a margin of}} only five votes, and Hastings later regretted his support.|$|E
5|$|Alan Tudyk applied {{through a}} casting office and {{several months later}} was called in for an audition, where he met with Whedon. He was called back to test with <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> {{for the role of}} Zoe (Wash's wife) and was told that it was down to him and one other candidate. The Zoes he tested with were not {{selected}} (Gina Torres eventually received the role) and Tudyk was sent home, but received a call informing him he had the part anyway.

5|$|In 1586, {{following}} the death of previous Polish king, Stefan Bathory, the Swedish duke Sigismund III Vasa and Habsburg Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria took part in the election to the joint Polish–Lithuanian throne.

The rivalry between Zamoyski and the Zborowski family dated years past and tensions during the elections ran high.|$|E

5|$|In 1848, Kentucky Democrats {{nominated}} Linn Boyd for governor, but Boyd {{declined the}} nomination. Powell {{was chosen to}} replace Boyd on the ticket, {{largely due to the}} influence of James Guthrie. The Whig party nominated Senator John J. Crittenden, and the race was complicated by former Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson's announcement that he would run as an independent Democratic candidate. Knowing the Democrats' chances were dimmed by having <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> in the race, Powell arranged a meeting with Johnson, following which the latter withdrew his candidacy and pledged his support to Powell. Nevertheless, Crittenden won the election.|$|E
5|$|In January 1950, Douglas opened {{campaign}} headquarters in Los Angeles and San Francisco, which {{was seen as}} a signal that she was serious about contesting Downey's seat and would not withdraw from the race. Downey challenged Douglas to a series of debates; Douglas, who was not a good debater, declined. The <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> traded charges via press and radio, with Downey describing Douglas's views as extremist.|$|E

5|$|Later sources {{suggest that}} {{perceptions}} of legitimacy {{played a part}} in the arguments, as did the relative age of the <b>two</b> <b>candidates.</b> In time, Edward was anointed by Archbishops Dunstan and Oswald at Kingston upon Thames, most likely in 975. There is evidence that the settlement involved a degree of compromise. Æthelred appears to have been given lands which normally belonged to the king's sons, some of which had been granted by Edgar to Abingdon Abbey and which were forcibly repossessed for Æthelred by the leading nobles.|$|E

5|$|The UFA government, {{which had}} campaigned on electoral reform, {{introduced}} AV {{in the rural}} constituencies in 1926, with the unique feature of only two rounds: rather than redistribute votes from each last-place candidate in several counts, only the top <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> from the first count would advance to the second count. Edmonton and Calgary were also converted to STV districts, where a complicated system of vote transfers resulted in roughly proportional results.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to invite Bach {{was made by}} the council on 15 January 1723.

Graupner's performance took place on the last Sunday after Epiphany, 17 January 1723. Two days before the event, the town council already agreed to offer him the position.|$|E

5|$|The decisive {{battle between}} the <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> was won by Stephen Báthory at Sânpaul on July 8, 1575. In the same year, he was elected king of Poland, thus a {{personal}} union was formed {{between the two countries}} that lasted until his death in 1586. He left the administration of the principality first to his brother, Christopher Báthory (15751581), and then to his brother's minor son, Sigismund Báthory (15811602), bestowing on them the title of voivode, while he himself took the title of prince.|$|E
