In reality, {{even though}} Birns {{was killed by}} a car bomb, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> to link Greene to his murder. Even though it is {{commonly}} speculated that Greene killed Birns, his murder remains officially unsolved.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} reported {{that some of}} the attackers were British citizens, but the Indian government later stated that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> to confirm this. Similarly, early reports of 12 gunmen were also later shown to be incorrect.|$|E
5|$|Arguing for {{the defence}} was lawyer Jagmal Singh.

5|$|In 1997, the {{survivors}} filed a claim with a South Korean compensation committee under the binational Status of Forces Agreement.

5|$|In 2002, the {{controversy}} was revived. Alerted to the incident, American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), which had established the Cornelius P. Rhoads Memorial Award in 1979, commissioned a new investigation. It {{was led by}} Jay Katz, emeritus professor at Yale Law School and a specialist in medical ethics. He concluded <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of unethical human experimentation, but the letter was so offensive that the prize should be renamed. AACR concurred and stripped the honor from Rhoads because of his racism.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Sikorski was exhumed and his {{remains were}} {{examined}} by Polish scientists, who in 2009 concluded that he died due to injuries consistent with an air crash, and that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> that Sikorski was murdered, ruling out theories that he was shot or strangled before the incident; however they did {{not rule out the}} possibility of sabotage, which is still being investigated by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance. , the investigation continues.|$|E

5|$|On July22, 1916, a bomb {{exploded}} during the San Francisco Preparedness Day Parade, killing ten people and wounding 40. Police suspected Berkman, although <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence,</b> and ultimately their investigation focused on two local labor activists, Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings. Although neither Mooney nor Billings were anarchists, Berkman {{came to their}} aid: raising a defense fund, hiring lawyers, and beginning a national campaign on their behalf. Mooney and Billings were convicted, with Mooney sentenced to death and Billings to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the fire could not be {{determined}} with certainty. One possibility is that a fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel, {{and the opening of}} the elevator shaft in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen, causing the fire to spread. There is also a theory that the fire was set by burglars who tried to cover their tracks; however, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of a burglary.|$|E
5|$|The {{site and}} the finds from it are the {{property}} of the Glastonbury Antiquarian Society.

5|$|A {{grand jury}} petition, bearing over 1,400 {{signatures}} across 134 pages, was {{filed with the}} Tulsa County election board by Medlin on November 6, 1989. The petition alleged that local and state officials violated the state's open meetings, conspiracy, and conflict of interest laws while planning the turnpike. The election board certified the petition as meeting the required threshold of 1,000 signatures on December 15. Work on the turnpike continued despite the investigation. After meeting for seven days, on January 19, 1990, the grand jury determined that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> to support the allegations and no need for further investigation.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{concerns}} are hypothyroidism, allergies, epilepsy, diabeties and glandular disorders which may cause baldness. The hair loss occurs at around {{six months of}} age, affecting the neck, thighs and tail; however the frequency has been reduced through work conducted by the breed clubs. Hip dysplasia is seen in around 8.3% of the breed, according to surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals over a twenty five-year period between 1974 and 1999. This {{was one of the}} lower results of the sporting breeds, with Greyhounds coming lowest with 3.4%, and the related Boykin Spaniel coming in second highest at 47%. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of elbow dysplasia found. The breed has an average life span of 1013 years.|$|E
5|$|After he was arrested, Gonzalez gave {{permission}} for his vehicle, parked nearby, to be searched. Agents recovered 800 rounds of ammunition, two hatchets, and a machete from the car.

5|$|After {{his release}} on bond, Jernigan {{returned}} to {{the room at the}} Continental Inn in Lexington where he had been living prior to his arrest. On July 18, 1984, Jernigan's son Randy found him dead in the room. An autopsy showed that Jernigan suffered from coronary atherosclerosis, and heart disease was officially listed as the cause of death. Lexington police determined that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> to suggest foul play. Jernigan's ex-wife continued to pursue Jernigan's case against Wilkinson, but a Fayette County Circuit Court Judge awarded Wilkinson a summary judgment to dismiss the case in 1986.|$|E
5|$|At one time, one {{hurricane}} researcher {{identified a}} tropical storm over Cuba in late August, although <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> the storm actually existed. There was also a report of a hurricane over Louisiana on October22, although it is unknown if it was related to other storms in the season. There may have been additional unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines.|$|E

Frontal brain lobe functions were relatively spared from deterioration and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of progressive neurological disease, depressive symptoms or other functional illness. Her cognitive functioning was in fact found to improve slightly over the six-month period. Calment reportedly remained mentally intact until the end of her life.|$|E
