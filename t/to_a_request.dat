5|$|Because of {{its effects}} in the United States, the name Frances was retired {{in the spring of}} 2005 by the World Meteorological Organization, and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. It was {{replaced}} with Fiona for the 2010 season. Due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>request</b> by France in the 2003 WMO Meeting, the name Frances was to be removed from the rotating cyclone lists after the 2004 hurricane season, even if Frances wasn't as destructive, but the destruction caused by Frances in the United States was enough to warrant retirement on its own merit.|$|E

5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1917, the {{unrestricted}} submarine warfare campaign—which Germany had launched {{at the beginning of}} February—had so succeeded that the entire Allied war effort was endangered. Strong reinforcements to the Allied antisubmarine forces were desperately needed to avert defeat and needed at once.

However the next Mayor, Boris Johnson, elected in 2008, {{announced that the}} scheme would not go ahead as it was not cost effective and too disruptive. In response <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>request</b> from Johnson, Transport for London undertook to reduce the bus flow in Oxford Street by 10% in both 2009 and 2010. Subsequently, the New West End Company called for a 33% reduction in bus movements in Oxford Street.|$|E

Conscious that his division was the only sizable non-American unit in a theatre of operations having an overall American command structure, Barrowclough requested, and received, a charter {{that allowed him to}} seek instructions from the New Zealand Government if he felt the division was to be involved in operations that could result in significant casualties.|$|E

During the Second World War he provided James Chadwick with samples of uranium hexafluoride for Tube Alloys, the British wartime nuclear weapons program, and later established a pilot plant to produce it in Widnes. In 1944, in response <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>request</b> from the Americans for someone with expertise in both uranium chemistry and industrial operations, he went to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to assist the Manhattan Project.|$|E

5|$|During 1944 the 4th Armoured Brigade {{provided}} crews for comparative {{trials of}} the American M4 Sherman and British Churchill tank in New Guinea conditions that were conducted by the Australian Army in response <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>request</b> from the British War Office. Macarthur-Onslow proposed including other tanks in these trials, including a British Cromwell that had been shipped to Australia in 1943, but this did not occur. Before the tanks were sent to New Guinea, the 4th Armoured Brigade trialled two Sherman tanks alongside Grants and Matilda IIs in Queensland during mid-1944. The Churchills and Shermans were subsequently trialled in the Madang region of New Guinea; the Churchill proved better suited to jungle conditions. The Australian Army later ordered 510 Churchills, but none were delivered {{before the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|From 1–14 February 1945, Hartmann briefly led I. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 53 {{as acting}} Gruppenkommandeur {{until he was}} {{replaced}} by Helmut Lipfert. In March 1945, Hartmann, his score now standing at 336 aerial victories, was asked a second time by General Adolf Galland to join the Me262 units forming to fly the new jet fighter. Hartmann attended the jet conversion program led by Heinrich Bär. Galland also intended Hartmann to fly with Jagdverband 44. Hartmann declined the offer, preferring to remain with JG52. Some sources report that Hartmann's decision to stay with his unit was due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>request</b> via telegram made by Oberstleutnant Hermann Graf. Now Gruppenkommandeur of I./JG52, Erich Hartmann claimed his 350th aerial victory on 17 April, {{in the vicinity of}} Chrudim. The last wartime photograph of Hartmann known was taken in connection with this victory.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>request</b> {{from the}} New Zealand government, Barrowclough was nominated by Freyberg for {{command of the}} Pacific Section of 2NZEF, which was based in Fiji. With the entry of Imperial Japan into the war, this was an important command as Fiji was {{the last line of}} defence for mainland New Zealand. Barrowclough embarked for New Zealand in early 1942 but during his transit, the commanding officer of the Pacific Section became seriously ill and was invalided home to be immediately replaced by Major General Owen Mead. On Barrowclough's arrival in New Zealand, he was disappointed to find that his expected command was no longer available. He was eventually posted as the commander of the Northern Division with the rank of major general. He was responsible for the defence of the upper North Island, and {{for the next few months}} oversaw the reorganisation and training of his new command.|$|E
