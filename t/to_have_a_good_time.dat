25|$|Kwaito is a {{political}} and party-driven genre, as performers use the music to express their political views, and also to express their desire <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time.</b> Kwaito is a music that came from a once hated and oppressed people, but it is now sweeping the nation. The main consumers of Kwaito are adolescents {{and half of the}} South African population is under 21. Some of the large Kwaito artists have sold more than 100,000 albums, and in an industry where 25,000 albums sold is considered a gold record, those are impressive numbers.

These include Tumi, Ben Sharpa, HipHop Pantsula, Tuks Senganga.|$|E

500|$|Before {{his arrival}} on screen, Barber {{described}} Rhys as being determined and focused, while Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy said his arrival {{would cause a}} stir. Rhys is ambitious, persuasive and manipulative. His profile on the official Neighbours website states that he believes Erinsborough is [...] "a bit of a backwater", while he {{is more of a}} city guy. Rhys is an enthusiastic young doctor and often riles his colleague, Karl, in his quest to become a surgeon. He wants to succeed and can justify why he does certain things, which hurt other people. Rhys is good at separating his work life from his home life and he knows how <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time.</b> Barber revealed that Rhys does have a sensitive side and he can mean well.|$|E
500|$|... "Blow" [...] is a electropop and dance-pop {{song that}} uses a synth infused beat as a backing. [...] The song opens with {{laughing}} followed by a command to dance. As the chorus of the song starts in, Kesha's vocals change into an auto-tuned [...] "stuttering" [...] as she repeats [...] "This place about to blow" [...] four times over an electro beat. During the song's bridge, Kesha's vocals change pace into a rap-sing style as she tells her listeners to [...] "Go insane, go insane / Throw some glitter / Make it rain on 'em / Let me see them Hanes." [...] Kesha uses layered vocals that are enhanced in some parts {{with the use of}} Auto-Tune. Lyrically, [...] "Blow" [...] portrays a simple message, described as a party-anthem, the song speaks of having a desire <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> at the club. According to Robert Cospey from Digital Spy, the track is of similar character to Benny Benassi's track, [...] "Satisfaction" [...] (2002).|$|E

Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times stated, [...] "despite that first-night stumble and several numbers in which her dancing was no more than adequate, Spears can safely call this performance a success". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that [...] " [...] was less a concert than a Las Vegas-style revue of intimidating complexity. Throughout, though she spoke little, Ms. Spears appeared radiant and unfettered, often smiling and never uncommitted". Dixie Reid of The Sacramento Bee commented that the show was [...] "a mesmerizingly big production with entertaining videos (including the infamous Spears-Madonna kiss), confetti, sparklers and even a stilt-walker. Who could ask for more? Everyone seemed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> at the circus". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph said Spears is [...] "the queen of production line pop and reclaims that diamanté crown with the most perfectly plastic pop show ever staged".|$|E

500|$|Loud is a {{departure}} from the personal, melodramatic themes of Rated R. Stylistically, it is a return to the Caribbean-inspired dance-pop of Rihanna's earlier work. Ryan Burleson of Consequence of Sound described the album as [...] "a dynamic R and dance-pop record". In an interview with MTV, Rihanna said [...] "I wanted songs that were all Rihanna songs, that nobody else could do. I didn't want the generic pop record that Ke$ha or Lady Gaga or Katy Perry could just do and it'll work. I wanted a song, or songs, that were Rihanna songs, that only I could do, had that little West Indian vibe to it, had that certain tone, a certain sass and a certain energy." [...] During the promotion of Loud, Rihanna said that much of the music was born out of frustration. She explained: [...] "When you go to a club and have to listen to bad music you revert to the liquor, because you want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time.</b> I hate having to skip a track. I wanted to make an album you can just play." ...|$|E
500|$|J. Broad {{wrote that}} the phrase [...] "have a nice day" [...] is an apt middle ground for the [...] "drop dead" [...] the cashier is {{thinking}} and the [...] "come back soon" [...] the owner wants. Broad stated that the phrase is meaningless {{because it has been}} castrated by excessive usage and pretense. He compared the phrase to the salutation [...] "How are you?" [...] and the phrase [...] "had a lovely time", which are [...] "conversational space-fillers" [...] that help prevent embarrassing silences. Usage of the term has been compared to inserting the phrase [...] "you know" [...] or the word [...] "like" [...] in sentences. In 1982, comedian George Carlin joked at Carnegie Hall, [...] "That's the trouble with 'Have a nice day'; it puts all the pressure on you. Now you've got to go out and somehow manage <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time,</b> all because of some loose-lipped cashier. 'Have a nice day ...'

After delving into her musical history, Beyoncé states [...] "I just want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> with y'all" [...] before she begins the concert with her rendition of Michael Jackson's [...] "I Wanna Be Where You Are". Following her rendition of [...] "I Wanna Be Where You Are", Beyoncé begins a medley of past Destiny's Child songs, stopping each track to discuss her life and mindset during each stage of her career. During her performance of [...] "Independent Women" [...] she reveals how her father, Mathew Knowles, submitted the track to the Charlie's Angels (2000) soundtrack without permission, reveals that she wants to write a song [...] "that celebrates a woman's curves" [...] inspired by Stevie Nicks' guitar riff in [...] "Edge of Seventeen" [...] (1982) for [...] "Bootylicious" [...] and states [...] "With a lot of success comes a lot of negativity...they were being nasty but it inspired me" [...] before performing [...] "Survivor".|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after his}} casting was announced, Barber told a {{reporter}} for the Herald Sun that he loved his character and said his determination and focus would get him into trouble. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy said Rhys's arrival would cause a stir in Erinsborough and may not go down well with some of the local residents. Barber also called Rhys ambitious and said that while he is not a villain, he is not an entirely good guy either. The actor explained [...] "He rides that line and that's {{a lot of fun to}} play. There are a lot of different dynamics. He can be very persuasive, bordering on manipulative, but he has a sensitive side as well, which is coming out gradually." [...] Barber told a writer for Inside Soap that Rhys is good at separating his work life from his home life, and can easily switch from one to the other. Barber quipped that Rhys knows how <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time,</b> while the official Neighbours website said he considers himself [...] "a bit of a ladies' man". A Herald Sun reporter said Rhys would [...] "rile" [...] his colleague, Karl Kennedy. Alan Fletcher, who plays Karl, revealed that his character and Rhys would share many scenes. Fletcher explained that it can be [...] "somewhat galling" [...] for Karl to be faced with Rhys, who is an enthusiastic young doctor. The actor added [...] "So expect some fun confrontation but also cleverly the writers have explored what Rhys and Karl might have in common." ...|$|E

Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "It's not that it doesn't have effective moments, it's that it doesn't have as many as it thinks it does.
