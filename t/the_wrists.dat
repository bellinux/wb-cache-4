5|$|Early in {{this section}} Heilmann embarks on a {{thorough}} description of the Berlin Archaeopteryx specimen, which includes detailed comparisons to specific aspects of modern birds. Following a comparison of its skull to that of Aetosaurus, Euparkeria, and a modern pigeon, Heilmann states that he disagrees with the scientific consensus {{of the time that}} the skull of Archaeopteryx is that of a true bird. He writes that the reptilian features of the skull are much more pronounced, citing features of the teeth, fenestrae, and jaw structure as being undeniably un-birdlike. Heilmann found that much of Archaeopteryxs anatomy, in fact, was decidedly reptilian and generally opposed to that of modern birds. This included the pelvis, which lacks a pectineal process and has a very different os sacrum from modern birds, as well as the carpus, which Heilmann wrote exhibited the same phenomena found in <b>the</b> <b>wrists</b> of modern reptiles. Its tail was also noted by Heilmann as being extremely reptilian and resembling nothing known of modern birds.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>wrist</b> strap is used {{to secure}} the grip to the gymnast's hand and to {{transfer}} body weight from the fingers to <b>the</b> <b>wrist.</b> It encircles <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> and is then locked in place with either velcro or buckles. Gymnasts typically wear soft material, such as cloth wristbands, under <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> straps to prevent skin chafing. Some brands of grips include soft, removable pads that fit under <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> straps.|$|R
50|$|The {{most visible}} change {{was made to}} the stock. The {{buttstock}} comb was extended further forward on <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> to strengthen <b>the</b> <b>wrist's</b> weak spot. <b>The</b> <b>wrist</b> itself was also thickened.|$|R
50|$|Extensor tendon {{compartments}} of <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> are anatomical tunnels on {{the back}} of <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> that contain tendons of muscles that extend (as opposed to flex) <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> and <b>the</b> digits (fingers and thumb).|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>wrist</b> (carpus), {{composed}} of the carpal bones, articulates at <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> joint (or radiocarpal joint) proximally and the carpometacarpal joint distally. <b>The</b> <b>wrist</b> {{can be divided into}} two components separated by the midcarpal joints. The small movements of the eight carpal bones during composite movements at <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> are complex to describe, but flexion mainly occurs in the midcarpal joint whilst extension mainly occurs in the radiocarpal joint; the latter joint also providing most of adduction and abduction at <b>the</b> <b>wrist.</b>|$|R
50|$|How muscles act on <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> {{is complex}} to describe. The five muscles acting on <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> {{directly}} — flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, extensor carpi radialis, extensor carpi ulnaris, and palmaris longus — {{are accompanied by}} the tendons of the extrinsic hand muscles (i.e. the muscles acting on the fingers). Thus, every movement at <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> is <b>the</b> work {{of a group of}} muscles; because <b>the</b> four primary <b>wrist</b> muscles (FCR, FCU, ECR, and ECU) are attached to the four corners of <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> they also produce a secondary movement (i.e. ulnar or radial deviation). To produce pure flexion or extension at <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> these muscle therefore must act in pairs to cancel out each other's secondary action. On the other hand, finger movements without <b>the</b> corresponding <b>wrist</b> movements require <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> muscles to cancel out the contribution from the extrinsic hand muscles at <b>the</b> <b>wrist.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{use of any}} {{keyboard}} {{may cause}} serious injury (that is, carpal tunnel syndrome or other repetitive strain injury) to hands, wrists, arms, neck or back. The risks of injuries can be reduced by taking frequent short breaks {{to get up and}} walk around a couple of times every hour. As well, users should vary tasks throughout the day, to avoid overuse of the hands and wrists. When inputting at the keyboard, a person should keep the shoulders relaxed with the elbows at the side, with the keyboard and mouse positioned so that reaching is not necessary. The chair height and keyboard tray should be adjusted so that <b>the</b> <b>wrists</b> are straight, and <b>the</b> <b>wrists</b> should not be rested on sharp table edges. Wrist or palm rests should not be used while typing.|$|E
25|$|This {{position}} has the subject bound in a horizontal position, sometimes face up but usually face down. The body is lifted into this position either by attaching bondage equipment to <b>the</b> <b>wrists</b> and ankles, or {{to other areas}} of the body, or a mixture of both, with the subject's weight born by these areas. The ankles or wrists may be brought together or kept apart by a spreader bar. In case of <b>the</b> <b>wrists</b> and ankles ropes or suspension cuffs can be used. When the body itself is used to suspend the person, they may first be tied into a conventional bondage position such as a hogtie or ball tie, then by attaching ropes or chains to ropes under areas of the body able to take weight the person is lifted into the air.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Fifty-two {{asymptomatic}} {{adults who}} were between twenty and thirty-five years old had arthrog-raphy of <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> {{with use of}} a single injection into the radiocarpal joint. The {{purpose of the study}} was to eval-uate the integrity of the triangular fibrocartilage, the scapholunate ligament, and the lunotriquetral ligament. Contrast medium was injected under fluoroscopic guid-ance, and posteroanterior and lateral radiographs of <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> were made after the subjects had performed exer-cises of <b>the</b> <b>wrist.</b> No patient who had a history of trauma to <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> pain in <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> or inflammatory arthritis was included in the study. All of the subjects had an examination of both upper exfremities that included measurement of the active motion of <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> with a goniometer, strength-testing with a Jamar dynamometer...|$|R
50|$|Arthritis of <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> {{can occur}} over time due to {{avascular}} necrosis and nonunion of the scaphoid. Symptoms may include aching in <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> decreased {{range of motion}} of <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> and pain during activities such as lifting or gripping. If x-ray results show arthritis due to an old break, the treatment plan will first focus on treating the arthritis through anti-inflammatory medications and wearing a splint when an individual feels pain in <b>the</b> <b>wrist.</b> If these treatments do not help the symptoms of arthritis, steroid injections to <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> may help alleviate pain. Should these treatments not work, surgery may be required.|$|R

25|$|An {{experiment}} {{that was the}} subject of a documentary on the National Geographic Channel's Quest For Truth: The Crucifixion, showed that nailed feet provided enough support for the body, and that the hands could have been merely tied.

25|$|Seals at <b>the</b> <b>wrists</b> {{and neck}} prevent water {{entering}} the suit by a close contact fit against {{the skin around}} <b>the</b> <b>wrists</b> and neck. The seals are not absolutely watertight, however, and the wearer may experience some seepage during use. The wearer will also get damp due to sweat and condensation. The seals are typically made from latex rubber or foam neoprene, but are also available in silicone rubber. Latex seals are supple but easily damaged and deteriorate with exposure to oils, oxygen, and other materials, so they must be replaced periodically, every two years or more often. Latex also causes an allergic reaction in some users. Neoprene seals last longer and are non-allergenic, but, being less elastic, let more water enter {{because they do not}} seal as effectively as latex seals to the contours of wrist and neck. They are also typically glued and sewn together to form a tube, and may leak along that seam.|$|E
25|$|If the {{prevailing}} fashion be {{to reject the}} long sleeve, and to partially display the arm, let the glove advance considerably above the elbow, and there be fastened with a draw-string or armlet.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveReporting {{clinical}} and electrodiagnostic characteristics of sport-related ulnar neuropathies at <b>the</b> <b>wrist.</b> Patients and methodsEight sport-related and 45 non-sport-related cases from 53 ulnar neuropathies at <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> cases over 14 years. ResultsSport-related ulnar neuropathies at <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> cases {{were due to}} cycling (5 cases), kayaking (2 cases), and big-game fishing (1 case). No patient had sensory complaints in ulnar digits, and all had motor impairment. Conduction across <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> with recording on the first dorsal interosseous muscle was impaired in all cases, with conduction block in 5. Two cyclists showed bilateral ulnar neuropathies at <b>the</b> <b>wrist.</b> All cases recovered within 2 to 6 months with sport discontinuation. Distal lesions of the deep motor branch were more frequent in sport- than non-sport-related cases. ConclusionsThe 8 sport-related ulnar neuropathies at <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> cases involved <b>the</b> deep motor branch. Conduction study to the first dorsal interosseous muscle across <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> is <b>the</b> key to electrodiagnostics. Bilateral cases in cyclists does not require wrist imaging...|$|R
50|$|Patients usually {{present with}} a history of an injury and {{localized}} pain. There is often a deformity in <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> with associated swelling. Numbness of the hand can occur because of compression on the median nerve across <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> (carpal tunnel syndrome). <b>The</b> <b>wrist</b> deformity often limits motion of the fingers.|$|R
25|$|Again, {{some claim}} that pro-active {{ways to reduce}} stress on <b>the</b> <b>wrists,</b> which alleviates wrist pain and strain, involve {{adopting}} a more ergonomic work and life environment. For example, some have claimed that switching from a QWERTY computer keyboard layout to a more optimised ergonomic layout such as Dvorak was commonly cited as beneficial in early CTS studies, however some meta-analyses of these studies claim that the evidence that they present is limited.|$|E
25|$|The tide {{began to}} turn against the 'thecodont' {{hypothesis}} after the 1964 discovery of a new theropod dinosaur in Montana. In 1969, this dinosaur was described and named Deinonychus by John Ostrom of Yale University. The next year, Ostrom redescribed a specimen of Pterodactylus in the Dutch Teyler Museum as another skeleton of Archaeopteryx. The specimen consisted mainly of a single wing and its description made Ostrom aware of the similarities between <b>the</b> <b>wrists</b> of Archaeopteryx and Deinonychus.|$|E
25|$|People with CTS {{experience}} numbness, tingling, or burning sensations in {{the thumb}} and fingers, {{in particular the}} index and middle fingers and radial half of the ring finger, because these receive their sensory and motor function (muscle control) from the median nerve. Ache and discomfort can possibly be felt more proximally in the forearm or even the upper arm. Less-specific symptoms may include pain in <b>the</b> <b>wrists</b> or hands, loss of grip strength, and loss of manual dexterity.|$|E
50|$|These cysts most {{frequently}} occur around the dorsum of <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> and on <b>the</b> fingers. A common site of occurrence is along the extensor carpi radialis brevis, {{as it passes}} over the dorsum of <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> joint. Although most commonly found in <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> ganglion cysts also may occur in the foot.|$|R
40|$|A {{positioning}} stand {{can help}} a surgeon with positioning and locking endoscopic tools, thereby avoiding the need foran assistant surgeon. The kinematic configuration of the positioning stand is comprised of two main parts: the arm (forpositioning), and <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> (for orienting <b>the</b> tool). The main requirement of <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> is to perform spherical movements around the incision point. A concentric multilink spher-ical joint design has been developed for <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> mechanism. <b>The</b> size synthesis is performed to minimize the overall size of <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> and also to maximize its range of angular movements. The type synthesis of the positioning arm {{has led to the}} use of a SCARA con-figuration as a balanced and easily moved arm configuration. The size synthesis of the arm is carried out with the goal of minimizing its overall dimensions, based on the arm’s reachable workspace and manipulability. The integration of <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> and arm is performed by optimizing the orientation of <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> {{in such a way that}} the in-terference between <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> and <b>the</b> workspace of the surgeon is minimized. 1...|$|R

40|$|The hanger reflex is {{a strong}} force {{illusion}} that was previously known {{to occur in the}} human head. We applied the hanger reflex to <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> and had expected that “sweet spots ” would exist for the hanger reflex at <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> similar to <b>the</b> properties of the hanger reflex at the head. By measuring the pressure distribution and the rotation angle when the hanger reflex device was attached to <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> we found “sweet spots ” that efficiently generate the hanger reflex at <b>the</b> <b>wrist.</b> Based on <b>the</b> pressure distribution obtained, we developed a device to control hanger reflex generation at <b>the</b> <b>wrist.</b> This device reproduces the pressure distribution by pressing on the hanger reflex “sweet spots” using four linear actuators, and thus generates the hanger reflex at <b>the</b> <b>wrist.</b> <b>The</b> results of user testing indicated that the device can produce rotational forces efficiently.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> {{effect of}} <b>wrist</b> angulation on <b>the</b> grip force (GF) scaling in healthy subjects. The first experiment investigated if hyperflexion or hyperextension of <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> affects <b>the</b> scaling of GF. Subjects performed sets of 10 lifts with <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> positioned in (i) a self-chosen, regular, slightly extended angulation, (ii) a hyperextended angulation and (iii) a hyperflexed angulation. The second experiment tested if wrist angulation applied during a preceding lift influenced GF scaling when lifting the object with a predefined wrist angulation. Compared with the regular and hyperflexed wrist angulations, subjects generated an overshoot of GF when lifting the object with <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> hyperextended. Irrespective of <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> angulation {{applied in the}} preceding lift, subjects generated an overshoot of GF when lifting the object with <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> hyperextended, but not during lifts with <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> in a regular or hyperflexed angulation. We demonstrate that {{a change in the}} horizontal angulation of <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> of <b>the</b> grasping hand interferes with the scaling of GF. We interpret these data to reflect a very basic strategic response of the motor system to changes in the geometry of the hand in order to ensure grasp stability...|$|R
