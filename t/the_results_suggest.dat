5|$|A 1996 {{molecular}} {{analysis of}} 38 different Suillus species used the sequences of their internal transcribed spacers to infer phylogenetic relationships and clarify the taxonomy of the genus. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that S.pungens was genetically similar to S.collinitus, S.neoalbidipes, S.pseudobrevipes, S.luteus, S.brevipes, S.weaverae, and certain isolates of S.granulatus.|$|E
5|$|A Chinese study {{published}} in 2001 used the molecular biological technique {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} to analyze the differences in DNA sequence between 23 A.gallica specimens collected from the Northern Hemisphere. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that based on the restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns observed, there are four global A.gallica subpopulations: the Chinese, European, North American–Chinese, and North American–European geographical lineages. A 2007 study on the northeastern and southwestern Chinese distribution of Armillaria, using fruit body and pure culture morphology, concluded that there are several unnamed species (Chinese biological species C, F, H, J and L) that are similar to the common A.gallica.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that wild Asiatic dayflower populations found growing on copper mine spoils in eastern China {{exhibited}} very high concentrations of copper within the plants, more so than the 48 species tested. Commelina communis had sequestered some 361mg/kg of copper, while the plant with the next highest concentration, Polygonum macrathum, had 286mg/kg. Five of the species examined, including the Asiatic dayflower, also showed high concentrations of other metals such as zinc, lead, and cadmium. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that the Asiatic dayflower is a good candidate for copper mine spoil revegetation and phytoremediation.|$|E

25|$|Another isotopic {{method has}} been {{employed}} {{to investigate whether}} protein sources in human diets in the early Anglo-Saxon varied with geographic location, or with respect to age or sex. This would provide evidence for social advantage. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that protein sources varied little according to geographic location and that terrestrial foods dominated at all locations.|$|E
25|$|The Y-chromosomal {{data has}} also {{revealed}} a common Finno-Ugric ancestry for the males {{of the neighboring}} Balts, speakers of the Indo-European Baltic languages. According to the studies, Baltic males are most {{closely related to the}} Finno-Ugric-speaking Volga Finns such as the Mari, rather than to Baltic Finns. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that the territories of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have been settled by Finno-Ugric-speaking tribes since the early Mesolithic period.|$|E
25|$|Experimental astroecology investigates {{resources}} in planetary soils, using actual space materials in meteorites. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that Martian and carbonaceous chondrite materials can support bacteria, algae and plant (asparagus, potato) cultures, with high soil fertilities. The results support that life could have survived in early aqueous asteroids and on similar materials imported to Earth by dust, comets and meteorites, {{and that such}} asteroid materials {{can be used as}} soil for future space colonies.|$|E

25|$|Reeves and Nass ran {{the test}} again but added a voice speaker to both {{computers}} that would verbally communicate {{information to make}} the human-social theme more explicit. The test resulted in {{almost exactly the same}} results. They concluded that people are polite to computers in both verbal and textual scenarios. The respondents did not need much of a cue to respond socially to the computers. The experiment proves that social rules can apply to media and computers can be social initiators. Participants denied being intentionally polite to the computer, but <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> differently.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, {{additionally}} {{to smoking}} bans in public buildings and transports, an anti-smoking ordinance for {{bars and restaurants}} was implemented in late 2007. A study by the University of Hamburg (Ahlfeldt and Maennig 2010) demonstrates, that the smoking ban had, if any, only short run impacts on bar and restaurant revenues. In the medium and long run no negative effect was measurable. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> either, that the consumption in bars and restaurants is not affected by smoking bans in the long run, or, that negative revenue impacts by smokers are compensated by increasing revenues through non-smokers.|$|E
25|$|In psoriatic {{arthritis}} (PsA), inhibitors of TNF, such as infliximab, improve {{the signs and}} symptoms. Several therapies with modest efficacy have been studied in nail psoriasis. Among available agents, higher quality data are available to support the efficacy of cyclosporine and infliximab. Based on studies in AS, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab {{have the potential to}} reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severely active axial involvement in PsA in patients who have had an inadequate response to NSAID (level 1a, grade A). The anti-TNF agents (infliximab and etanercept; level 1b, grade A) are more effective for the treatment of enthesitis than traditional agents. Results suggest infliximab is effective for the treatment of dactylitis in PsA.|$|E

500|$|The {{controversy}} over Lee's plans and his officers' implementation {{of them have}} led historians to question whether the charge could have succeeded if done differently. [...] One study used a Lanchester model to examine several alternative scenarios and their outcomes. [...] <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that Lee could have captured a foothold on Cemetery Ridge if he had committed several more infantry brigades to the charge; but this likely would have left him with insufficient reserves to hold or exploit the position.|$|E

2500|$|Professor Jim Stevenson from Southampton University, {{and author}} of the report, said: [...] "This has been a major study {{investigating}} an important area of research. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> that consumption of certain mixtures of artificial food colours and sodium benzoate preservative are associated with increases in hyperactive behaviour in children.|$|E
