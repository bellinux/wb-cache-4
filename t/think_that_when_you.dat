2500|$|The band {{returned}} to Rock's Plantation Studios in Hawaii in May 2003 {{to begin the}} first recording sessions for the album. Their intention was to record an album even more simplified than Gravity and even closer in sound to what they sounded like live, an overall different record. [...] "I think we all knew going into it {{that it was an}} important record for us," [...] said Duncan Coutts. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> get more than ten years into a band, It has to be a rebirth for us. We didn't want to go and remake any of our past records." [...] In one month, they recorded 12 songs live off the floor, most in two or three takes each. Following these sessions, several of the songs including [...] "Walking in Circles", [...] "No Warning" [...] and [...] "Wipe That Smile Off your Face" [...] were premiered live. After touring concluded for the year, the band was set to finish the album that October in time for a January 2004 release. While satisfied with the recorded material at first, with time the band became more critical of it and decided they would only be demos. They felt strongly about the songs [...] "Picture", [...] "Will the Future Blame Us?" [...] and [...] "Angels/Losing/Sleep" [...] but felt {{that the rest of the}} songs didn't live up to them. [...] "Even though we loved the energy of what we'd done, not enough of the songs were making the hair stand up on the back of your neck and so we realized that we needed to do more work," [...] bass player Duncan Coutts explained. They decided to postpone the album's release until June and then August to continue recording.|$|E
2500|$|Spears {{talked about}} her {{feelings}} toward the conservatorship her father contains and how she feels about her life, and quotes [...] "There's no excitement, there's no passion... I have really good days, and then I have bad days. Even {{when you go to}} jail, you know there's the time when you're gonna get out. But in this situation, it's never ending. It's just like Groundhog Day every day." [...] Spears added [...] "I think it's too in control, If I wasn't under the restraints I'm under, I'd feel so liberated. When I tell them the way I feel, it's like they hear but they're really not listening. I never wanted to become one of those prisoner people. I always wanted to feel free." [...] The singer also commented on her feelings towards fans and her music style. [...] "It's weird because your music is a reflection of what you're going through," [...] she says. [...] "It's such a part of me, the record, 'cause of what I've gone through." [...] In another clip, Spears talks about how she uses her work as a dancer and singer to deal with the stress of her life and how it helps her deal with her emotions. She said that for her, dancing is like therapy. [...] "If I have a lot of nervous energy, when I start dancing, it all goes away and I just feel emotion. It's like a rollercoaster," [...] she says. [...] "People <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> go through something in life {{you have to go to}} therapy. For me, art is therapy, because it's like you're expressing yourself in such a spiritual way. [...] "Sometimes you don't need to use words to go through what you need to go through," [...] she continues. [...] "Sometimes it's an emotion you need to feel when you dance, that you need to touch. And the only thing that can touch it is when you move a certain way." ...|$|E

5000|$|Rachel Platten {{said of her}} inspiration: [...] "'Fight Song' was {{inspired}} by a lot of experiences that were hurting me and that were making me feel like maybe I didn’t have a chance in this industry. I wrote it because I needed to remind myself that I believed in myself. No matter what, I still was gonna make music, even if it was on a small scale. Even if it was just for me." [...] She also said: [...] "I really challenged myself in writing {{the past couple of years}} to be vulnerable in my lyrics. I didn’t want to skate past what was hurting. It didn’t scare me to be vulnerable because I <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> get something great." ...|$|R

2500|$|Lyrically, love, independence, and {{maturity}} became reoccurring themes throughout the album. With {{songs such as}} [...] "'I'm Still in Love with My Ex" [...] and [...] "Better Without You" [...] inspired by Rowland's former relationship with American football player Roy Williams, most of the tracks Rowland recorded were relationship-driven, something {{she said she was}} not hesitant about discussing. [...] "I just went in the studio and just did me, because I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> get your best product. <b>That's</b> <b>when</b> it's just natural. It just flew out of my mouth and came out in lyrics [...] I had great writers involved." [...] While recording her vocals, Rowland was inspired by several singers, citing former bandmate Beyoncé Knowles, and singers Brandy and Whitney Houston as major inspirations, [...] "I listened to a lot of Whitney Houston for her vocals. I love her. I love Beyoncé's voice, and I love Brandy. Those are three vocalists who inspire me. I love how different they are. I love how they take themselves to the next level." ...|$|R

They will throw themselves down on the ground, leap up as you pass over them, stab your horses from below, seize your legs and try to drag you from your saddles, leap up on to the crupper behind you, and stab you to the heart.

My family is, as you are aware, not without influence at court, and they would, were I the husband of your daughter, do all in their power to incline the emperor favorably towards you; while, were I rejected, they would probably view your refusal to accept my offers as a slight to the family, and resent it accordingly.

I know how poor and weak has been my life; but I know how rich and strong is that other life. Do not cry, Nelly,--not till I am gone; and then not beyond measure.

It seems that our great {{grandfather}} had an elder son--a wild sort of fellow--the old people used to tell stories of him. He went on, in short, till he was disinherited, and went off to America. What became of him afterwards I never could make out; but I have sometimes questioned how I should receive any of his heirs if they should turn up some day. Mind you, you need not have the slightest scruple in holding your own. It was made over to my grandfather by will, as I have made it sure for you; but I do <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come to think how to dispose of it, the possibility of the existence of these Charlecotes might be taken into consideration.' ...|$|E

60|$|In {{regard to}} the general history of the expedition, and of the manners, customs, religion, and {{politics}} of Carthage, I have followed M. Hennebert in his most exhaustive and important work on the subject. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have read to the end you will perceive that although our sympathies may remain with Hannibal and the Carthaginians, it was nevertheless {{for the good of}} the world that Rome was the conqueror in the great struggle for empire. At the time the war began Carthage was already corrupt to the core, and although she might have enslaved many nations she would never have civilized them. Rome gave free institutions to the people she conquered, she subdued but she never enslaved them, but rather strove to plant her civilization among them and to raise them to her own level. Carthage, on the contrary, was from the first a cruel mistress to the people she conquered. Consequently while all the peoples of Italy rallied round Rome in the days of her distress, the tribes subject to Carthage rose in insurrection against her as soon as the presence of a Roman army gave them a hope of escape from their bondage.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{expect a}} man to produce {{beautiful}} and wonderful works of art, you ought to allow him a certain freedom of action, you ought {{to give him a}} long rope, you ought to let him follow his fancy and look for his material wherever he thinks he may find it! A mother can't nurse her child unless she follows a certain diet; an artist can't bring his visions to maturity unless he has a certain experience. You demand of us to be imaginative, and you deny us that which feeds the imagination. In labor we must be as passionate as the inspired sibyl; in life we must be mere machines. It won't do. When you have got an artist to deal with, you must take him as he is, good and bad together. I don't say they are pleasant fellows to know or easy fellows to live with; I don't say they satisfy themselves any better than other people. I only say that if you want them to produce, you must let them conceive. If you want a bird to sing, you must not cover up its cage. Shoot them, the poor devils, drown them, exterminate them, if you will, in the interest of public morality; it may be morality would gain--I dare say it would! But if you suffer them to live, let them live on their own terms and according to their own inexorable needs!" ...|$|E
60|$|I have a {{suspicion}} that Esquemeling--though how or where I can make no surmise--must have obtained {{access to these}} records, and that he plucked from them the brilliant feathers of several exploits to stick them into the tail of his own hero, Captain Morgan. But that is by the way. I mention it chiefly as a warning, for when presently I come to relate the affair of Maracaybo, {{those of you who}} have read Esquemeling may be in danger of supposing that Henry Morgan really performed those things which here are veraciously attributed to Peter Blood. I <b>think,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come to weigh the motives actuating both Blood and the Spanish Admiral, in <b>that</b> affair, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> consider how integrally the event is a part of Blood's history--whilst merely a detached incident in Morgan's--you will reach my own conclusion as to which is the real plagiarist.|$|R
