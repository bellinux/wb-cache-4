50|$|In {{international}} law, {{customary law}} {{refers to the}} Law of Nations or the legal norms that have developed through the customary exchanges between states over time, whether based on diplomacy or aggression. Essentially, legal obligations are believed to arise between states {{to carry out their}} affairs consistently with past accepted conduct. These customs can also change based on the acceptance or rejection by states of particular acts. Some principles of customary law have achieved the force of peremptory norms, which cannot be violated or altered except by a norm of comparable strength. These norms are said to gain their strength from universal acceptance, such as the prohibitions against genocide and slavery. Customary international law can be distinguished from treaty law, which consists of explicit agreements between nations <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> <b>obligations.</b> However, many treaties are attempts to codify pre-existing customary law.|$|E
40|$|The The Diploma Thesis {{deals with}} the {{institute}} of Catholic marriage, also called matrimony, and aims to provide detailed analyses on nullity of matrimony due to invalidity of matrimonial consent and its declaration. Firstly, the Thesis states a definition of matrimony with respect to Sacrament of Marriage being governed by the divine law, the canonical law, and, in regards to certain effects, the civil law. Pursuant to Code of Canon Law [CIC], 1983, canon 1055, § 1, the matrimonial covenant, by which {{a man and a}} woman establish between themselves a communion of the whole life, is by its nature ordered toward the good of the spouses and procreation and education of offspring. Hence, marriage is a contract by which {{a man and a woman}} become irrevocably united, the Code of Canonic Law set up essential properties of marriage obligationes matrimonii essentialis, which are not to be excluded by either contractants. The Thesis further provides commentary on the grounds for the invalidity of the matrimonial consent, by descripting the reasons for nullity of matrimony which are defined by the Code of Canon Law, and can be grouped under these main causes: serious mental incapacity, incapacity <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> <b>obligations,</b> ignorance, error of person,simple error, fraud, simulation, conditional marriage, force and [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} {{of the law of}} the sea has been shaped largely by two notions, namely, freedom of navigation on the one hand, and restricted access on the other hand. The interaction between these two opposing notions has led to the acceptance of two compromise concepts, namely, the territorial sea and the right of innocent passage. These concepts have now been codified in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This paper examines the right of innocent passage in the territorial sea under the Law of the Sea Convention regime as matched against contemporary state practice. It would appear that many coastal states prefer the restriction of this right – seemingly infringing what the Convention stands for. It is submitted that states should restructure their policies and regulations to conform <b>to</b> their <b>assumed</b> <b>obligations</b> under the Convention...|$|R

In this paper we analyze the distribution of credit in Spain for the period from 2000 and 2012 using financial indicators, a bankruptcy prediction model, and studying inequality. There are two main findings: between 2000 and 2012 the credit in Spain is highly concentrated in a few companies with an increasing tendency; and that Banks granted credit to firms without taking into account the financial performance of firms. Given the financial crisis that Spain has suffered, we offer a complementary approach and we claim for a credit revision of financial markets performance...|$|R

40|$|Forty-seven {{states parties}} to the Convention on the Rights of the Child have {{accompanied}} their ratification of the instrument with reservations or interpretative declarations intended to limit the scope of their obligations. Thus, although the Convention on the Rights of the Child is now the most successful and widely-ratified human rights treaty, with more than 175 states parties, this impressive support for the instrument is regrettably mitigated by the reservations. Of the few holdouts that have failed to ratify, the United States is surely the most important. Though it signed the treaty in February 1995 without reservation, {{there can be no}} doubt that if the United States ever ratifies the Convention this will be associated with a substantial list of reservations should past behavior be any guide. Making reservations to multilateral treaties is a well-accepted practice in international law.

As the European Union is {{preparing}} to launch the discussions that will eventually lead to the admission of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Cyprus, a question that is increasingly being asked by the prospective members is what should they hope to obtain from those discussions or accession negotiations. They have already {{been told that the}} negotiations will determine their terms of accession and will ascertain their ability <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> the <b>obligations</b> of membership or ‘acquis communautaire’. In fact what they like to know is whether they could receive any exceptions or special treatment that will ease the pain of adjustment to life inside the EU. They want to know whether and how they can obtain derogations from the acquis. Yet, "derogation" is a dirty word in the European Union. No one admits it exists, nor {{that it is possible to}} obtain any during the accession negotiations. This short paper attempts to separate myth from reality and highlight what may be realistically pursued in the negotiations [...] The rest of this short paper explains why negotiations are necessary, reviews the various types of derogations and provide examples from past accession negotiations to indicate what appears to be a feasible request for derogation and how past applicant countries presented and justified their requests...|$|R
40|$|Pathology has {{recently}} entered {{the era of}} personalized medicine. This brings new expectations for the accuracy and precision of tissue-based diagnosis, in particular, when quantification of histologic features and biomarker expression is required. While for many years traditional pathologic diagnosis has been regarded as ground truth, this concept is no longer sufficient in contemporary tissue-based biomarker research and clinical use. Another major change in pathology is brought by the advancement of virtual microscopy technology enabling digitization of microscopy slides and presenting new opportunities for digital image analysis. Computerized vision provides an immediate benefit of increased capacity (automation) and precision (reproducibility), but not necessarily {{the accuracy of the}} analysis. To achieve the benefit of accuracy, pathologists will have <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> an <b>obligation</b> of validation and quality assurance of the image analysis algorithms. Reference values are needed to measure and control the accuracy. Although pathologists' consensus values are commonly used to validate these tools, we argue that the ground truth can be best achieved by stereology methods, estimating the same variable as an algorithm is intended to do. Proper adoption of the new technology will require a new quantitative mentality in pathology. In order to see a complete and sharp picture of a disease, pathologists will need to learn to use both their analogue and digital eyes...|$|R

Contrary <b>to</b> this <b>assumed</b> <b>obligation,</b> all G 20 countries with the exception of France and the UK saw significant increases in their CO 2 emissions over the last 25 years, surpassing 300 % in the case of China. This paper attempts to forecast the evolution of carbon dioxide emissions in Bahrain over the 2012 – 2021 decade by employing seven Automated Forecasting Methods, including the exponential smoothing state space model (ETS), the Holt–Winters Model, the BATS/TBATS model, ARIMA, the structural time series model (STS), the naive model, and the neural network time series forecasting method (NNAR). Results indicate a reversal of the current decreasing trend of pollution in the country, with a point estimate of 2309 metric tons per capita at the end of 2020 and 2317 at the end of 2021, as compared to the 1934 level achieved in 2010. The country’s baseline level corresponding to year 1990 (as specified by the Doha amendment of the Kyoto protocol) is approximately 25. 54 metric tons per capita, which implies a maximum level of 20. 96 metric tons per capita for the year 2020 (corresponding to a decrease of 18 % relative to the baseline level) in order for Bahrain to comply with the protocol. Our results therefore suggest that Bahrain cannot meet its assumed target...|$|R
