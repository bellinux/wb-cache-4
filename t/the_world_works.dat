5|$|Mr. Bean {{often seems}} unaware of basic {{aspects of the}} way <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>works,</b> and the {{programme}} usually features his attempts at what would normally be considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, interior decorating, or going to church. The humour largely comes from his original (and often absurd) solutions to problems and his total disregard for others when solving them, his pettiness, and occasional malevolence.|$|E

25|$|According to the theory, {{accommodation}} is {{the process}} of reframing one's mental representation of the external world to fit new experiences. Accommodation can be understood as the mechanism by which failure leads to learning: when we act on the expectation that the world operates in one way and it violates our expectations, we often fail, but by accommodating this new experience and reframing our model of the way <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>works,</b> we learn from the experience of failure, or others' failure.|$|E

25|$|While Ethical Culturists {{generally}} {{share common}} beliefs {{about what constitutes}} ethical behavior and the good, individuals are encouraged {{to develop their own}} personal understanding of these ideas. This does not mean that Ethical Culturists condone moral relativism, which would relegate ethics to mere preferences or social conventions. Ethical principles are viewed as being related to deep truths about the way <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>works,</b> and hence not arbitrary. However, it is recognized that complexities render the understanding of ethical nuances subject to continued dialogue, exploration, and learning.|$|E
25|$|The museum {{regularly}} hosts notable special exhibitions, often {{focusing on}} the works of one artist that have been loaned out {{from a variety of}} other museums and sources {{for the duration of the}} exhibition. These exhibitions are part of the attraction that draw people both within and outside Manhattan to explore the Met. Such exhibitions include displays especially designed for the Costume Institute, paintings from artists from across <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>works</b> of art related to specific art movements, and collections of historical artifacts. Exhibitions are commonly located within their specific departments, ranging from American decorative arts, arms and armor, drawings and prints, Egyptian art, Medieval art, musical instruments, and photographs. Typical exhibitions run for months at a time and are open to the general public. Each exhibition provides insight into the world of art as a transformative, cultural experience and often includes a historical analysis to demonstrate the profound impact that art has on society and its dramatic transformation over the years.|$|E
500|$|Actor Billy Bob Thornton {{admitted}} to {{watching the show}} during a 2016 interview with GQ. He and his daughter Bella used to watch My Little Pony, which she eventually grew out of, and when searching for the series to watch again, came across Friendship Is Magic and started watching it with her. He also liked the show's positive messages about how <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>works,</b> pointing to [...] "The Cutie Map" [...] as an example. On an episode of Late Night with Seth Meyers, Thornton also claimed that while his daughter's favorite character is Twilight Sparkle, his favorites were Fluttershy (who he said was his favorite because [...] "she talks like Marilyn Monroe") and Rainbow Dash.|$|E

500|$|The city's {{historical}} and cultural attractions have been lauded by numerous national newspapers, including the Boston Globe and The New York Times. Omaha {{is home to the}} Omaha Community Playhouse, the largest community theater in the United States. The Omaha Symphony Orchestra and its modern Holland Performing Arts Center, the Opera Omaha at the Orpheum theater, the Blue Barn Theatre, and The Rose Theater form the backbone of Omaha's performing arts community. Opened in 1931, the Joslyn Art Museum has significant art collections. Since its inception in 1976, Omaha Children's Museum has been a place where children can challenge themselves, discover how <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>works</b> and learn through play. The Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts, one of the nation's premier urban artist colonies, was founded in Omaha in 1981, and the Durham Museum is accredited with the Smithsonian Institution for traveling exhibits. The city is also home to the largest singly funded mural in the nation, [...] "Fertile Ground", by Meg Saligman. The annual Omaha Blues, Jazz, & Gospel Festival celebrates local music along with the Omaha Black Music Hall of Fame.|$|E
500|$|Paloma Josse, an {{advanced}} {{soon to be}} thirteen-year-old, belongs {{to one of the}} conventional families living in the posh apartment building where Renée works. Daughter of an important parliamentarian father (a former government minister), and a Flaubert-quoting mother, Paloma has a penchant for absurdism. She regards her sister's scholarship as [...] "cold and trivial" [...] and deems her mother's culture as conventional and useless. Paloma herself values Japanese works, and reads manga, haiku, and tanka. She keeps two diaries, one called [...] "Journal of the Movement of the World" [...] to record her observations of the world around her, and the other called [...] "Profound Thoughts" [...] to record her many and wide-ranging reflections on art, poetry, people and herself. She is introspective, and truly kind, though she tries her best to avoid the inquisition of others. She understands many facets of the world that are unseen by others, and deeply [...] understand the way <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>works,</b> and the many perils and pitfalls of adulthood and the many hypocrisies of modern society, and therefore resolves in not an all melodramatic way, to commit suicide. However, a drastic plot twist {{at the end of the}} tale opens to her an amazing new truth: beauty, that provides meaning to our lives.|$|E

[...] Anthroposophist Frederick Dennehy opined in Lilipoh magazine that [...] "Tarnas’ deeply radical hypothesis is that the disenchantment of the modern universe is unreal – the result of a “simplistic epistemology” and moral positioning totally inadequate to the depths, complexity and grandeur of the cosmos." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{weeks before}} the film's premiere, the Daily Telegraph erroneously {{reported}} that Luhrmann gave in to studio pressure after [...] "intense" [...] talks with executives and re-wrote and then re-shot the ending of Australia for a happier conclusion after [...] "disastrous reviews" [...] from test screenings. To counter these negative reports, the studio had Jackman and Kidman promoting Australia on The Oprah Winfrey Show, which dedicated an entire episode of the program to the film, and Fox Co-Chairman Tom Rothman spoke to the Los Angeles Times where he described the Telegraph article as [...] "patently nonsensical. It's all too typical of the way <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>works</b> today that everybody picked up an unsourced, anonymous quote-filled story in a tabloid from Sydney and nobody ever bothered to {{check to see if}} it was accurate". Rothman also said that Luhrmann had final cut on his film. The director admitted that he wrote six endings in the drafts he authored, and shot three of them.|$|E
2500|$|André Téchiné {{was born}} on 13 March 1943 at Valence-d'Agen, {{a small town in}} the [...] Midi-Pyrénées region, {{department}} of Tarn-et-Garonne, France. [...] His family, of Spanish ancestry, owned a small business making agricultural equipment. [...] He grew up in the south west French country side and in his adolescence acquired a passion for films. From 1952 to 1959 he [...] went to a Catholic boarding school in Montauban. [...] He was allowed to leave the school only on Sunday afternoons when he would go to the cinema, although he often had to return before the screening ended. From 1959 he attended a secular state school, which exposed him to a different culture, with Marxist teachers, a cine club and a film magazine, La Plume et l'écran, to which he contributed. [...] "Films were my only opening to the world," [...] Téchiné explained in an interview. [...] "They were my only possibility of escaping my family environment and my boarding school. It was probably dangerous because, through movies, I learned how <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>works</b> and how human relations work. But it was magical, and I was determined to follow the thread of that magic." ...|$|E

2500|$|Charlie has wild curly hair, is wary of people, and {{frequently}} enthralled with objects and patterns. According to Krumholtz, Charlie wants {{to understand how}} <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>works.</b> His father has said Charlie is easily fascinated, possesses a big heart and is thorough, but he misses certain things completely. Meanwhile, Larry observed that he is [...] "a talented theoretician with an ego problem" [...] and a student once described him as fast-talking and disorganized, to the agreement of Larry. Fleinhardt also accurately noticed that his colleague has a high standard of guilt and is a pragmatist. Charlie is rather fond of providing excessive explanations (e.g., his discussion of Occam's razor) and reducing complex phenomena to intuitively obvious situations through practical analogies that are quite unlike Larry's metaphysical musings and cosmic metaphors. (These analogies are known as [...] "audience visions" [...] or, as friend Megan Reeves calls them, [...] "those cute little analogies.") While contemplating, his antics and mannerisms may even disconcert more conventional thinkers. Wearing his headset, Dr. Eppes has an intense focusing ability as he voraciously writes equations, often covering several chalkboards with a staccato clacking and {{the aid of a}} red chalk holder. Nevertheless, if his line of thought is interrupted during a tense moment, as one of restricted foresight, he can become very disgruntled. Further, when deeply concentrating on a particular problem, it seems Charlie is unable to provide insights to other topics for the sake that they are simply needed or wanted—he has to write what is in his head. Like his brother Don, he is characteristically stubborn and obsessive ("one part exuberance, two parts obsession"), {{especially when it comes to}} work, but he's rather naïve when it comes to human behavior. The latter often interferes with his FBI work and, thus, is the cause of much distress for him at times.|$|E
60|$|Take common sense. Does {{not common}} sense {{tell us that}} if God made this world, and governs it by righteous and God-like laws, {{this must be a}} world in which evil-doing cannot thrive? God made the world better than that, surely! He would be a bad law-giver who made such laws, that it was as well to break them as to keep them. You would call them bad laws, surely! No, God made the world, and not the devil; and <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>works</b> by God's laws, and not the devil's; and it {{inclines}} towards good, and not towards evil; and he who sins, even in the least, breaks God's laws, acts contrary to the rule and constitution of the world, and will surely find that God's laws will go on in spite of him, and grind him to powder, if he by sinning {{gets in the way of}} them. God has no need to go out of His way to punish our evil deeds. Let them alone, and they will punish themselves. Is it not so in every thing? If a tradesman trades badly, or a farmer farms badly, there is no need of lawyers to punish him; he will punish himself. Every mistake he makes will take money out of his pocket; every time he offends against the established rules of trade or agriculture, which are God's laws, he injures himself; and so, be sure, it is in the world at large,--in the world in which men and the souls of men live, and move, and have their being.|$|E
