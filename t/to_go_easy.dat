500|$|Werner Erhard and his est Training {{programs}} and later The Forum have been parodied in films, both directly and through more subtle references. [...] Still in other films {{that did not}} directly intend to parody the subject matter, other reviewers have found elements of the est movement as applied to the genre of fictional self-help films. [...] The 1977 movie Semi-Tough, starring Burt Reynolds, parodied the est training. [...] Bert Convy played [...] "Friedrich Bismark," [...] a caricature of Werner Erhard. [...] Bismark's organization and its training went by the name [...] "B.E.A.T.", which stands for: [...] "Bismark Earthwalk Action Training." [...] In real life, Erhard had a Mercedes Benz with a llicense plate that said [...] "SO WHUT", in the film, Bismark rode in a limousine that said: [...] "BEAT IT". A form of Rolfing was also parodied in the film, and Lotte Lenya's character [...] "Clara Pelf", called PELFING", was described as: [...] "a Rolf like masseuse." [...] The press caught on to this satire of Erhard in the film, and gave these sections of the film positive reviews. [...] The Wall Street Journal did not give an overall positive review, but did appreciate the portions where Werner Erhard was parodied: [...] "The movie isn't much - an erratic ramble - But it has some pleasant moments, and a delicious send-up of The self-improvement guru Werner Erhard." [...] The Charlotte Observer praised Bert Convy's portrayal of the self-help guru Frederick Bismark, writing: [...] "Bert Convy is a hilariously smug consciousness-raiser with a more than passing resemblance to EST's Werner Erhard." [...] After the film's release, Bert Convy appeared on The Tonight Show and discussed his experiences when he attended an est training seminar in preparation {{for his role as}} Frederick Bismark. [...] During actual filming on Semi-Tough, Convy received a late-night phone call from actress Valerie Harper, known in Hollywood as a devoted student of Werner Erhard. [...] She related to Convy that Erhard was [...] "pleased" [...] with the role, and she wished him success in the film. [...] However, Convy suspected that her real reason for calling was to subtly pressure him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>easy</b> on his parody of Erhard in the film. However, several EST graduates shunned the film for making fun of the training, its methods, its philosophy, as well as Werner Erhard, himself.|$|E
2500|$|The 1935 Senior {{race was}} {{postponed}} {{until the next}} day due to poor weather. The race produced a dramatic competition. Guthrie led away at number 1 while Stanley Woods starting at number 30 had a 15-minute wait. By the last lap, Guthrie had built up a lead of 26 seconds. As the Moto Guzzi pit-attendants made preparations for Stanley Woods to refuel on the last lap, the Norton pit-crew signalled to Guthrie <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>easy</b> the pace on the last lap. Stanley Woods riding for Moto Guzzi went straight through the TT Grandstand area without stopping on the last lap and set a new overall lap record of 26minutes and 10 seconds at an average speed of 86.53mph. Despite the Norton team telephoning the signal-station at Ramsey on the last lap to indicate to Guthrie to speed up the pace, Stanley Woods won the race by 4 seconds from Guthrie in 3hours, 7minutes and 10 seconds at an average speed of 84.68mph. After the race Guthrie said [...] "I went as quick as I could but Stanley went quicker. I am sorry but I did the best I could." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Semi-Toughs {{release in}} 1977, Bert Convy was {{contacted}} {{by a number}} of est followers, as well as by Werner Erhard. [...] After Convy appeared on The Tonight Show and discussed his experiences attending Erhard Seminars Training in preparation for his role as Friedrich Bismark, he received a letter from Erhard stating: [...] "it would be great for us to get together". [...] Of the est seminar itself, Convy recalled that when another attendee complained of a headache during the course, the group leader told him to [...] "experience it", and when another attendee wet his pants, he was told to [...] "experience the warmth". [...] In a scene from the film, a woman exclaims to Friedrich Bismark {{in the middle of a}} seminar: [...] "I peed in my pants and it felt good." [...] During actual filming on Semi-Tough, Convy received a late-night phone call from actress Valerie Harper, known in Hollywood as a devoted student of Werner Erhard. [...] She related to Convy that Erhard was [...] "pleased" [...] with the role, and she wished him success in the film. [...] Convy suspected that her real reason for calling was to subtly pressure him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>easy</b> on his parody of Erhard in the film.

2500|$|Ian Chappell {{came from}} a South Australian cricket dynasty, his {{maternal}} grandfather Vic Richardson had been captain of Australia and his younger brothers Greg and Trevor Chappell also played for Australia. In the 1960s the young Ian Chappell had been noted as an aggressive batsman and gifted slip fielder who played for South Australia when only 18 and Australia when 21. He was not an immediate success with the bat, he made only one century in his first 17 Tests, but kept his place due to some extraordinary slip catches and his ability as a part-time leg-spinner. He ended his run-drought with 548 runs (68.50) against the West Indies in 1968–69. He {{was known as a}} man who could make runs when Australia were under pressure, and some thought he was a better batsman than his gifted brother Greg for this reason. Despite a poor tour of South Africa in 1969–70 Chappell was made Bill Lawry's vice-captain in the 1970–71 Ashes series. Lawry's defensive tactics earned him few friends and when Australia went into the last Test needing a victory to retain the Ashes he was controversially replaced by the aggressive Chappell, who had already made two centuries in the series. Chappell won the toss, put England in to bat and Australia had a 100 run lead in the first innings, but Ray Illingworth's team fought back to win the Test and the series. Nevertheless Chappell was made captain for the 1972 Ashes series and his young team surprised Illingworth’s veterans by halving the series 2–2. He now had young talent in the shape of Rod Marsh, Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee, Bob Massie, Ross Edwards, Max Walker and Jeff Thomson and moulded them into a tough, combative team that dominated the mid-1970s; they beat Pakistan 3–0 and the West Indies 2–0 in 1972–73, New Zealand 2–0 in 1973–74, England 4–1 in 1974–75 and 1–0 in 1975. This success was not without its price as the Ugly Australians won few prizes for sportsmanship, with Chappell demanding 100% commitment from his players, and winning at all costs. In the 1975 Cricket World Cup Australia made 328/5 against Sri Lanka and Chappell told his team <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>easy</b> as the newcomers could not possibly win and he wanted to improve their image, but he reversed his decision when they reached 70/1. As a result Sidath Wettimuny was carried off the field after being hit three times by Jeff Thomson, the 5'2" [...] Duleep Mendis retired hurt after being hit between the eyes by a bouncer and Australia won by 52 runs. In 1975–76 he passed on the Australian captaincy to his brother Greg, but stayed in the team as they beat Clive Lloyd's West Indians 5–1. He was instrumental in the creation of Kerry Packer's professional World Series Cricket to rival the Australian Board of Control and improve the financial lot of Australian cricketers and captained the WSC Australia XI. When Packer and the ABC came to a deal Chappell returned to Test cricket against England the West Indies in 1979–80 before finally retiring.|$|E

The Iron Man had no chance. Billy was too completely the master, guarding every blow, himself continually and almost at will tapping the other's face and body. There was no weight in Billy's blows, only a light and snappy tingle; but their incessant iteration told on the Iron Man's temper. In vain the onlookers warned him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>easy.</b> His face purpled with anger, and his blows became savage. But Billy went on, tap, tap, tap, calmly, gently, imperturbably. The Iron Man lost control, and rushed and plunged, delivering great swings and upper-cuts of man-killing quality. Billy ducked, side-stepped, blocked, stalled, and escaped all damage. In the clinches, which were unavoidable, he locked the Iron Man's arms, and in the clinches the Iron Man invariably laughed and apologized, only to lose his head with the first tap the instant they separated and be more infuriated than ever.|$|E
