5|$|The Buckeye {{was first}} bred and {{developed}} in 1896, by a Warren, Ohio resident named Nettie Metcalf. They {{are the only}} American breed of chicken {{known to have been}} developed by a woman, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> were customarily given charge of the household poultry flock throughout much of U.S. history. Metcalf crossbred Barred Plymouth Rocks, Buff Cochins, and some black breasted red games to produce the Buckeye. Her goal was a functional breed that could produce well in the bitter Midwest winters. Contrary to popular belief the Buckeye breed was created before the Rhode Island Red breed and Metcalf actually sent birds to the RIR breeders for them to improve their breed.|$|E
5|$|Fitzgerald's {{goal was}} to produce a {{literary}} work which would truly prove himself as a writer, and Gatsby {{did not have the}} commercial success of his two previous novels, This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and Damned. Although the novel went through two initial printings, some of these copies remained unsold years later. Fitzgerald himself blamed poor sales on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> tended to be the main audience for novels during this time, and Gatsby did not contain an admirable female character. According to his own ledger, now made available online by University of South Carolina's Thomas Cooper library, he earned only $2,000 from the book. Although 1926 brought Owen Davis's stage adaption and the Paramount-issued silent film version, both of which brought in money for the author, Fitzgerald still felt the novel fell short of the recognition he hoped for and, most importantly, would not propel him to becoming a serious novelist in the public eye. For several years afterward, the general public believed The Great Gatsby to be nothing more than a nostalgic period piece.|$|E
5|$|Globally, women's {{access to}} health care remains a challenge, both in {{developing}} and developed countries. In the United States, before the Affordable Health Care Act came into effect, 25% of women of child bearing age lacked health insurance. In the absence of adequate insurance, women are likely to avoid important steps to self care such as routine physical examination, screening and prevention testing, and prenatal care. The situation is aggravated by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> living below the poverty line are at greater risk of unplanned pregnancy, unplanned delivery and elective abortion. Added to the financial burden in this group are poor educational achievement, lack of transportation, inflexible work schedules and difficulty obtaining child care, all of which function to create barriers to accessing health care. These problems are much worse in developing countries. Under 50% of childbirths in these countries are assisted by healthcare providers (e.g. midwives, nurses, doctors) which accounts for higher rates of maternal death, up to 1:1,000 live births. This is despite the WHO setting standards, such as a minimum of four antenatal visits. A lack of healthcare providers, facilities, and resources such as formularies all contribute to high levels of morbidity amongst women from avoidable conditions such as obstetrical fistulae, sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer.|$|E

In New Zealand the working man brings his female relations in a van to the poll, and sees to it that they vote in accordance with his orders.

5|$|In most cases, {{the owner}} and {{the driver of the}} chariot were {{different}} persons. In 416 BC, the Athenian general Alcibiades had seven chariots in the race, and came in first, second, and fourth; obviously, he could not have been racing all seven chariots himself. Philip II of Macedon also won an Olympic chariot race in an attempt to prove he was not a barbarian, although if he had driven the chariot himself he would likely have been considered even lower than a barbarian. The poet Pindar did praise the courage of Herodotes of Thebes, however, for driving his own chariot. This rule also meant that women could win the race through ownership, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> were not allowed to participate in or even watch the Games. This happened rarely, but a notable example is the Spartan Cynisca, daughter of Archidamus II, who won the chariot race twice. Chariot racing was a way for Greeks to demonstrate their prosperity at the games. The case of Alcibiades indicates also that chariot racing was an alternative route to public exposure and fame for the wealthy.|$|E
25|$|About 70 {{percent of}} ECT {{patients}} are women. This {{may be due}} to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> {{are more likely to be}} diagnosed with depression.

25|$|Hajibeyov devoted {{much energy}} {{to the idea of}} {{integrating}} woman's role and status into the male-dominated world. The concept of women's emancipation runs through many of his works often in the form of comedy or satirization as in the case when he makes fun of the process of selecting marriage partners, a process hindered by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> were still wearing veils until the 1920s when the Soviet regime prohibited them.|$|E
25|$|Cultural factors, such as {{discrimination}} {{of various}} kinds, can negatively affect productivity {{such as age}} discrimination, stereotyping, discrimination against people with physical disability, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, and caste discrimination. Women are the group suffering from {{the highest rate of}} poverty after children; 14.5% of women and 22% of children are poor in the United States. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> {{are more likely to be}} caregivers, regardless of income level, to either the generations before or after them, exacerbates the burdens of their poverty.|$|E
25|$|Domestic {{workers are}} those who perform a variety of tasks for and in other peoples' homes. For example, they may cook / clean the house and look after children.

25|$|Throughout {{the history}} of ECT, women have {{received}} it {{two to three times}} as often as men. Currently, about 70 percent of ECT patients are women. This may be due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> {{are more likely to be}} diagnosed with depression. A 1974 study of ECT in Massachusetts reported that women made up 69 percent of those given ECT. The Ministry of Health in Canada reported that from 1999 until 2000 in the province of Ontario, women were 71 percent of those given ECT in provincial psychiatric institutions, and 75 percent of the total ECT given was given to women.|$|E
25|$|The repeal {{movement}} was initiated and {{financed by the}} Association Against the Prohibition Amendment, who worked to elect Congressmen who agreed to support repeal. The group's wealthy supporters included John D. Rockefeller, Jr., S. S. Kresge, and the Du Pont family, among others, who had abandoned the dry cause. Pauline Sabin, a wealthy Republican who founded the Women's Organization for National Prohibition Reform (WONPR), argued that Prohibition should be repealed because it made the United States a nation of hypocrites and undermined its respect {{for the rule of}} law. This hypocrisy and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> had initially led the prohibition movement convinced Sabin to establish the WONPR. Their efforts eventually led to the repeal of prohibition.|$|E
25|$|Women {{tend to have}} {{different}} occupational hazards and health issues than men in the workplace. Women get carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, anxiety disorders, stress, respiratory diseases, and infectious diseases due to their work at higher rates than men. The reasons for these differences may be differences in biology or in the work that women are performing. Women's higher rates of job-related stress {{may be due to}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> are often caregivers at home and do contingent work and contract work at a much higher rate than men. Another significant occupational hazard for women is homicide, which was the second most frequent cause of death on the job for women in 2011, making up 26% of workplace deaths in women. Immigrant women are at higher risk for occupational injury than native-born women in the United States, due to higher rates of employment in dangerous industries.|$|E

25|$|These {{studies suggest}} {{that men and women}} are {{different}} in terms of sexual arousal patterns and that this is also reflected in how their genitals react to sexual stimuli of both genders or even to non-human stimuli. Sexual orientation has many dimensions (attractions, behavior, identity), of which sexual arousal is the only product of sexual attractions which can be measured at present with some degree of physical precision. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> are aroused by seeing non-human primates having sex does not mean that women's sexual orientation includes this type of sexual interest. Some researchers argue that women's sexual orientation depends less on their patterns of sexual arousal than men's and that other components of sexual orientation (like emotional attachment) {{must be taken into account}} when describing women's sexual orientations. In contrast, men's sexual orientations tend to be primarily focused on the physical component of attractions and, thus, their sexual feelings are more exclusively oriented according to sex.|$|E
500|$|Much of Brant's {{influence}} {{came from}} her connections to Sir William Johnson and her stepfather Brant Kanagaradunkwa. Additional influence came from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> in Iroquois society had more political influence than did women in patriarchal societies. Under the Iroquois matrilineal kinship system, inheritance and social status were passed through the maternal line. Women elders influenced the selection of chiefs. [...] Because Brant's ancestry is unclear, historians have apparently disagreed about whether she was born into an influential clan. Brant {{has been described as}} the [...] "head of the Six Nations matrons", although historian Robert Allen writes that [...] "there is no substantive evidence to suggest that Molly was ever a clan matron or mother within the Iroquois matrilineal society". Fiester and Pulis write that [...] "although not born to the position, she became one of the Mohawk matrons".|$|E
500|$|Authors Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens {{commented that}} [...] "the video portrayed the deconstructive gender-bending {{approach}} associated with free play and self-reflexivity of images in postmodernism." [...] They had initially thought the video as a feminist approach to sexuality, {{leading them to}} say that [...] "the video might also relate to several core political questions raised by feminism." [...] However, they deduced that the scenes showing Madonna in a seductive manner and chained to her bed do not portray women in an empowering position, but emphasizes <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> can be in control because of their sexual prowess. Jarman-Ivens added that the epigraph establishes the status-quo, with a clear distinction of the body (workers, hand, labors) and the mind (elite, intellect capital). Unlike Metropolis, where the line denoted the binary oppositions of the labor class against the elitist, in the video Madonna did not distinguish between the two. Jarman-Ivens noted that the video portrayed {{both men and women}} being looked at, actively or passively. The body and the hand are not separate there, instead the heart, hand and head are portrayed as a balance in everybody, male or female. Scholar Theodore Gracyk also noted of the initial portrayal of female sexuality in the video, in his book, I Wanna Be Me: Rock Music and the Politics of Identity, and criticized the video for its portrayal of male domination. However, on close inspection, Gracyk {{came to the conclusion that}} [...] "Express Yourself" [...] was a smart move for Madonna, as it actually portrayed women in a much stronger position. Author John Evan Seery wrote in his book Political Theory for Mortals, that [...] "Madonna with her 'Express Yourself' video splicing together images of machines with images of sex,... represents the ultimate cyborg of late twentieth-century America." [...] Allen Metz felt that the scenes of Madonna grabbing her crotch and dancing were reminiscent of [...] "Michael Jackson's androgynous imitation of phallic masculinity." [...] He went on to compliment the video for its gender-bending depiction.|$|E

2500|$|Often, {{when faced}} with a person {{experiencing}} painful intercourse, a gynecologist will recommend Kegel exercises and provide some additional lubricants. Strengthening the muscles that unconsciously tighten during vaginismus may be extremely counter-intuitive for some people. Although vaginismus has not been shown to affect a person's ability to produce lubrication, providing additional lubricant can be helpful in achieving successful penetration. This is due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> may not produce natural lubrication if anxious or in pain. Treatment of vaginismus may involve the use Hegar dilators, (sometimes called vaginal trainers) [...] progressively increasing the size of the dilator inserted into the vagina.|$|E

To emphasis, [...] "food {{and nutrition}} insecurity is a gender justice issue". <b>The</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>women</b> and girls are the most oppressed by [...] "the inequitable global economic processes that govern food systems and by global trends such as climate change", shows how institutions continue to place women in positions of disadvantage and impoverishment to make money and thrive on capitalizing the food system.
