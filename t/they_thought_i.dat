25|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Pearce, he recalls the event:This {{has to do}} with politics, not to do with me because they had a local election and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was going to bring an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is like old women. I don't care about old women gossiping. If {{at the end of the}} day, it means I don't play, good, I don't want to play in the city of old women talking about people behind their backs. And they are so stupid they believe in all the rumours.|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{the episode}} was not {{planned to be}} {{produced}} during the seventh season. However, just before the writing crew prepared to take their Christmas break, one of the scheduled scripts {{was removed from the}} line-up. In order to meet the deadline, Frank Spotnitz, John Shiban, and Vince Gilligan decided to write a script about [...] "modern medicine versus backyards supernatural arts". Gilligan later joked that [...] "I think I was enlisted for the fact that I'm Southern, and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was the closest thing they had to a hillbilly on the staff".|$|E
500|$|Ben Stein's famous {{monotonous}} lecture {{about the}} Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was not originally in Hughes's script. Stein, by happenstance, was lecturing off-camera to the amusement {{of the student}} cast. [...] "I {{was just going to}} do it off camera, but the student extras laughed so hard when they heard my voice that (Hughes) said do it on camera, improvise, something you know a lot about. When I gave the lecture about supply-side economics, I thought they were applauding. Everybody on the set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had learned something about supply-side economics. But they were applauding because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was boring...It was the best day of my life", Stein said.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the podium}} ceremony, {{in which two}} Brazilian drivers participated {{for the first time}} since the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix, the top three {{finishers}} appeared in the obligatory press conference. Hamilton said that the decision to not make a pit stop during the safety car period was the team's decision: [...] "We had two very comfortable, two very decent stints and the team opted for me to stay out. I guess <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could pull out a gap but it was a 23 second gap I needed and I only had seven laps or something, so I don't know how that worked out." [...] Hamilton added that he felt that things looked good for the rest of the season, stating that [...] "if we [...] can continue with this momentum we have got we are looking very good".|$|E
500|$|The band's {{debut album}} {{warranted}} a Parental Advisory label {{because of the}} album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song [...] "Daddy" [...] was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: [...] "When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really {{like to talk about}} that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it..." [...] "Kill You" [...] was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother. Follow the Leader marked the first album where the majority of the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like [...] "Justin" [...] and [...] "Pretty" [...] written about incidents occurring during adulthood.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the season, O'Ree faced blatant racism from opponents, {{remarking}} [...] "people {{just wanted}} a piece of me, maybe because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was different, so I had to defend myself. [...] I wasn't going to be run out of any rink." [...] He endured racial slurs from fans in each of Chicago, Detroit and New York, though the taunts were largely absent in Montreal and Toronto. [...] O'Ree was supported by his teammates and Boston fans. He stated [...] "they were mean to me in places like Detroit and New York, too. [...] But never in Boston. [...] I'll never forget how my teammates there took care of me — men like Johnny Bucyk, Doug Mohns, Charlie Burns and Don McKenney. [...] They accepted me totally. [...] All of them had class." [...] In 1961, O'Ree was traded to Montreal {{but was unable to}} crack the Canadiens' line-up. [...] Playing over 20 minor league seasons, O'Ree twice won the Western Hockey League's scoring title: in 1964, with the Los Angeles Blades, and in 1969, with the San Diego Gulls.|$|E
30|$|At the beginning, {{my parents}} <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was crazy – {{both of them}} are intellectuals, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> should not give up my degree for a man.

6000|$|... "That {{is first}} rate!" [...] Harry said heartily, {{when he had}} finished. [...] "They did not give me meat, in prison. <b>I</b> suppose <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> was not strong enough for it." ...|$|R

500|$|Though {{newspapers}} {{reported that}} Baker had {{died as a}} result of engine failure, unsubstantiated rumors began to circulate that his death was not accidental. Those who knew him were aware of his reluctance to return to civilian life and his feelings over the loss of Scott. He could have returned to America and played professional sport, where he could have earned far more money than from a job in finance, but his upbringing made that impossible for him. A career in business held no appeal; during a weekend vacation with a fellow Princeton graduate, Baker revealed that he felt his life was over, and he would never again experience the thrills of football or hockey. In 1966, author John D. Davies published a biography of Baker, in which he noted that a relative of Baker's could not see a future for him in the post-war world. However, Davies refused to elaborate on what he called the [...] "suicide theory of [...] enigmatic death", as he feared that [...] "some of the old guard would be furious if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was trying to prove it".|$|E
500|$|In 531 career {{professional}} games, Cook scored 183 goals and 335 points. He {{was also an}} early innovator of the slapshot and of the drop pass. According to Cook: [...] "I had a dream about the drop pass one night and at our next practice, I told Frank and Bill about it. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was crazy, but they decided to humour me. By gosh, it worked! I'd cross over from left wing to centre as I moved in on defense. I'd fake a shot and leave the puck behind and skate away from it, with Frank or Bill picking it up. We {{got a lot of}} goals off the crisscross and drop pass." [...] Ed Sullivan, then of the New York Graphic, praised Cook's creativity: [...] "When Bun Cook is hot, {{he is one of the}} most amazing players in hockey. At such moments, he attempts plays that stagger the imagination." [...] In 1995, Cook was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame by the veterans committee. Often overshadowed by his linemates, he was the last member of the Bread Line to gain entry into the Hall, as he followed Bill (1952) and Frank Boucher (1958).|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} that {{followed}} the premiere Renoir reduced the film's running time from its original 113 minutes to 100 minutes, then to 90 minutes and finally to 85 minutes. He told Margurite Renoir and Zwobada to cut the scenes that the audience had found the most upsetting. Renoir said he mostly cut his own scenes or dialogue [...] "as though I were ashamed, after this rebuff, of showing myself on the screen." [...] He later defended his own performance as being awkwardthe way Octave should have been. The reduction in length removed Octave's complexity and completely changed the character's motives {{at the end of the}} film. In the 85 minute version Octave does not intend to run away with Christine and merely lends André his coat for warmth before sending him out to the greenhouse. The omission of this plot point resulted in the misconception that the film has an alternative ending; this was first reported by Roger Manvell after he watched it at its London premiere in 1946. At one point Jean Jay told Renoir to restore the film to the 100-minute version [...] "to avoid commercial disaster", but none of the shorter versions improved its reception or attendance figures. When asked about the film's poor reception with audience members, Renoir said [...] "I thought I was gentle with them, and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was laughing at them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That depends," [...] said Alan. [...] "If it {{was only}} you, they would likely send two-three lively, brisk young birkies, and if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> was {{to appear in the}} employ, I daresay ten or twelve," [...] said he.|$|R

[...] "Never have I {{had so many}} journalists on my doorstep, even on that notorious Thursday when <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> was going to declare war. I really fancy, Maraton, {{that they are going}} to make a celebrity of you. Have you seen the papers?" ...|$|R
500|$|As his {{political}} significance waned, Livingstone gained more {{work in the}} media, commenting that the press [...] "started to use me only once <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was harmless". To receive these outside earnings, he founded a company known as Localaction Ltd. In 1987 he authored an autobiography for HarperCollins, If Voting Changed Anything They'd Abolish It, conducted journalism for the London Daily News, stood in for BBC Radio 2 disk-jockey Jimmy Young, {{and served as a}} judge for that year's Whitbread Prize. In 1989, Unwin Hyman published his second book, Livingstone's Labour: A Programme for the 90s, in which he expressed his views on a variety of issues, while that same year he was employed to promote Red Leicester cheese in adverts for the National Dairy Council and to appear in adverts for British Coal alongside Edwina Currie. In October 1991 Livingstone began writing a column for Rupert Murdoch's right-wing tabloid The Sun, a controversial move among British socialists. In his column he often discussed his love of amphibians and campaigned {{for the protection of the}} great crested newt, on the basis of which he was appointed vice president of the London Zoological Society in 1996–97. He subsequently began to write a food column for Esquire and then the Evening Standard, also making regular appearances on the BBC quiz show Have I Got News For You?. In 1995, Livingstone was invited to appear on the track [...] "Ernold Same" [...] by the band Blur.|$|E
2500|$|Unknown speaker 1: [...] "I {{was held}} hostage {{in the front of}} the plane by the Arabs. They wouldn't believe that I was an American citizen, because they saw my {{passport}} that I was in Israel two weeks before. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was connected with the Israeli military, and I was held at gunpoint in front of the plane." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barbeau {{was cast}} in {{numerous}} television films and series such as The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, Valentine Magic on Love Island and Battle of the Network Stars. In her autobiography, she claimed: [...] "I actually thought CBS asked me to be on Battle of the Network Stars because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was athletic. My husband clued me in: who cared if I won the race, as long as I bounced when I ran?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't {{watch for}} the postman any more {{if it makes you}} have bad {{thoughts}} about him. Yes, <b>they</b> are bad <b>thoughts.</b> <b>I</b> won't have you think that he doesn't do everything that is right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, I don't think so. Two {{of the men}} {{sat here}} talking with feyther till past eleven o'clock, but <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> was in bed, as I had said goodnight and had gone into my room an hour before, and I did not see any one about in the village as I came back over the moor behind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, those idiots at {{the hotel}} have {{returned}} a letter sent {{to me by my}} lawyer. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> had left Madeira for good, and the letter was marked, 'If left, return to Messrs. Borley and Son,' with the address. And the mail went out this afternoon into the bargain, so it will be a month before I can get it back again." ...|$|R
2500|$|In February 2015, Eddie Murphy {{stated that}} his cameo {{appearance}} in the pilot ironically doomed the show's chances: [...] "I was gonna be in the pilot, and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> should be recurring. I’m not gonna do Beverly Hills Cop on TV. I remember when they tested it — they had this little knob that you turn {{if you like it}} or you don’t like it. So when Axel shows up in the pilot, some people turned the knob so much, they broke it. So the network decided 'if he isn’t recurring, then this isn’t gonna happen.' So it didn’t happen." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I did {{the pilot}} for Britain's Got Talent – which was {{originally}} {{going to be}} called Paul O'Grady's Got Talent. But I told the producers they were having a joke if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would front a show with that title. The original panel of judges was going to be Simon Cowell, Fern Britton and Piers Morgan. I was the host. Then when I had the row with ITV I was banned from the studios. I remember I rang Simon and told him he had a huge hit on his hands, {{but there was no way}} I could do it. I said, if I am banned I have to be banned from everything. I can’t be a hypocrite and come in and do this. I had to bow out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Emerson did not own {{a record}} player, he enjoyed {{listening}} to music on the radio, particularly Floyd Cramer's 1961 slip note-style [...] "On the Rebound" [...] {{and the work of}} Dudley Moore. He used jazz sheet music from Dave Brubeck and George Shearing and learned about jazz piano from books. He also listened to boogie-woogie, and to country-style pianists including Joe [...] "Mr Piano" [...] Henderson, Russ Conway and Winifred Atwell. Emerson later described himself: [...] "I was a very serious child. I used to walk around with Beethoven sonatas under my arm. However, I was very good at avoiding being beaten up by the bullies. That was because I could also play Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard songs. So, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was kind of cool and left me alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's odd," [...] I answered, [...] "but <b>I</b> suppose <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> had {{not enough}} grass for their horses, or Heaven knows what <b>they</b> <b>thought.</b> Stay now, <b>I</b> will do something," [...] and, opening the door, I {{called to the}} guards, honest fellows in their way, whom I had known in past times.|$|R

6000|$|... "Then {{go back to}} {{your young}} woman and comfort her," [...] I said, which he did, and when he had gone, not madly rushing into his loved one's arms, but {{shuffling}} along in a timid way, as if he was afraid the ghost hadn't gone yet, I asked Jone how he happened to think I was here, {{and he told me that}} he and Mr. Poplington had taken the road to the left when they reached the fork, because that was the proper one, but they had not gone far before he <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> might not know which way to turn, so they came back to the fork to wait for me. But I had been closer behind them than <b>they</b> <b>thought,</b> and <b>I</b> must have come to the fork before they turned back, so, after waiting a while and going back along the road without seeing me, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> must have taken the right-hand road, and they came that way, going down the hill very carefully. After a while Jone found my hat in the road, which up to that moment I had not missed, and then he began to be frightened and they went on faster.|$|R
2500|$|Hofmann started drag racing on the East Coast of the United States. He went to Australia {{twice for}} a three-month visit. [...] "Those trips {{were a good}} thing for me," [...] said Hofmann. [...] "Not only did I win a couple of championships, but I got the chance to meet the people from Blower Drive Service from Whittier, California. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had some {{potential}} and backed it up with $100,000 in sponsorship funding." [...] Hofmann added, [...] "That allowed me to hire Tom Anderson as a crew chief, one of the best moves I ever made. It was impossible for me to do both the driving and tuning by myself, and Tom had a lot more experience anyway. We ended up winning a lot of races together." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{youngest}} in {{his family}} with two sisters and a brother, Purden {{is believed to have}} been born in 1974. He was raised in Lanarkshire, Scotland. As a teenager, he won the title of Mr. Scotland in a Daily Record competition in 1992. The win opened the door to working as a catwalk model in Paris and Milan, including a three-year modelling stint for Giorgio Armani in Milan.}} [...] According to Purden, [...] "I was surrounded by beautiful people so I remember laughing my head off that <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> looked exotic. I was just a wee boy from a housing estate in Lanarkshire but I had thick, long curly hair and they liked me. The designer Romeo Gigli used me as his muse, and designed an entire collection on me. It was an amazing time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zander Hollander, {{who wrote}} The Complete Handbook of Pro Football, said about Gradishar, [...] "Not as nasty as Butkus, doesn't snarl like Lambert, but Gradishar {{makes all the}} plays. Hey, he can hit, too. Just ask Saints' Henry Childs, after Gradishar knocked his helmet off, [...] "It {{was the first in}} my career like that, in the open field". Gradishar's hitting ability was a {{sentiment}} echoed in Rick Korch's book, The Truly Great. In it, Tony Dorsett recalled the hit Gradishar gave him in a 1980 game, [...] "I ran a pass pattern and was wide open but Danny White did not see me. I go back to the huddle and tell Danny that I am wide open. I ran the same route again but this time I was almost decapitated. My eyes were only partially open when I hit the ground. Trainers and doctors came running onto the field. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was dead. Hey, I thought I was dead, too." [...] Hall of Fame defensive lineman Dan Hampton remembers asking Walter Payton, [...] "Walter, who gave you the hardest hit you ever took in the NFL?". According to Hampton, Payton replied, [...] "Randy Gradishar, 1978". In 1981 SPORT magazine named Gradishar one of the Top 5 hardest hitters in the NFL, quoting the modest Gradishar, [...] "The chance for a real good shot comes very seldom, but when it's there I take full advantage of it".|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{could make}} myself {{understood}} among {{them because they}} still talk a corrupt Zulu, as do all the tribes in those parts.

6000|$|... "That <b>they</b> did. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> {{was never}} going to get to sleep," [...] George said; and Bill gave a similar account of himself. [...] "Still, mother, a short night does no harm for once, and you haven't been able to get to church." ...|$|R
