5|$|On Election Day, Goldwater {{lost the}} {{election}} to Johnson by {{what was then the}} largest margin in history. Goldwater accumulated 52 electoral votes to Johnson's 486 and 39% of the popular vote (27,178,188) to Johnson's 61% (43,129,566). Goldwater carried six states: Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina and his home state of Arizona. Goldwater's strong showing in the south is largely due to his support of the white southern view on civil rights: that states should be able <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> laws without federal intervention.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the story}} is {{presented}} as a melodrama—the villainous slave-dealer even twirls his mustache—it conveys the injustices of the Code noir and realities of how slavery disrupted family life. European legal and ethical traditions allowed Africans to be deprived of legal personhood and the right <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> bodies; within this system, the Maroons who reclaimed their freedom became outlaws.|$|E

Nauruans wanted to maintain ties to their island. After the war the fight for phosphate royalties continued with renewed vigor, ending only when the Nauruans bought the phosphate industry from the commission for A$20 million, a transaction entwined intimately with Nauru's declaration of independence in 1968.|$|E

25|$|Death with Dignity National Center (DDNC) is a 501(c)3, nonpartisan, nonprofit {{organization}} headquartered in Portland, Oregon {{that has led}} the legal defense of and education about Death with Dignity laws throughout the US for 20 years.

Wahid {{rescinded}} Presidential Instruction No. 14/1967 and the 1978 Minister of Home Affairs directive. Confucianism once again became officially recognised as a religion in Indonesia. Chinese culture and Chinese-affiliated activities were again permitted. However, after the implementation of Otonomi Daerah (Regional Autonomy), provinces and regencies were permitted <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> administrative procedures. In 2014, there are again administrative districts that only permit five possible religious affiliations on the national identity card, a restriction that they have programmed into their computer databases.|$|E
25|$|When colonies {{attained}} dominion status, {{they also}} attained the right <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> systems of weights and measures. Many adopted the imperial {{system of units}} with local variations. India and Hong Kong supplemented the imperial system of units with their own indigenous units of measure, parts of Canada and South Africa included land survey units of measure from earlier colonial masters in their systems of measure while many territories used only {{a subset of the}} units used in the United Kingdom—in particular the stone, quarter and cental were not catalogued in, amongst others, Australian, Canadian and Indian legislation. Furthermore, Canada aligned her ton with US measures by cataloguing the ton of 2000lb as being legal for trade, but kept the imperial gallon.|$|E

25|$|The Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope {{expanded}} {{beyond the}} initial settlement and its borders were formally consolidated as the composite Dutch Cape Colony in 1778. At the time, the Dutch had subdued the indigenous Khoisan and San {{peoples in the}} Cape and seized their traditional territories. Dutch military expeditions further east were halted when they encountered the westward expansion of the Xhosa people. Hoping to avoid being drawn into a protracted dispute, the Dutch government and the Xhosa chieftains agreed to formally demarcate their respective areas of control and refrain from trespassing on each other's borders. However, the Dutch proved unable <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> independently minded settlers, who disregarded the agreement and crossed into Xhosa territory, sparking one of Southern Africa's longest colonial conflicts: the Xhosa Wars.|$|E
500|$|Franklin is {{best known}} for her {{writings}} on the political and social effects of technology. For her, technology was much more than machines, gadgets or electronic transmitters. It was a comprehensive system that includes methods, procedures, organization, [...] "and most of all, a mindset". She distinguished between holistic technologies used by craft workers or artisans and prescriptive ones associated with a division of labour in large-scale production. Holistic technologies allow artisans <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> work from start to finish. Prescriptive technologies organize work as a sequence of steps requiring supervision by bosses or managers. Franklin argued that the dominance of prescriptive technologies in modern society discourages critical thinking and promotes [...] "a culture of compliance".|$|E
500|$|Birth control {{advocacy}} {{also took}} on a global aspect as organizations around the world began to collaborate. In 1946, Sanger helped found the International Committee on Planned Parenthood, which evolved into the International Planned Parenthood Federation and soon became the world's largest non-governmental international family planning organization. In 1952, John D. Rockefeller III founded the influential Population Council. Fear of global overpopulation became {{a major issue in}} the 1960s, generating concerns about pollution, food shortages, and quality of life, leading to well-funded birth control campaigns around the world. The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development and the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women addressed birth control and influenced human rights declarations which asserted women's rights <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> bodies.See also: Petchesky, Rosalind Pollack (2001), [...] "Reproductive Politics", in The Oxford Companion to Politics of the World, Joël Krieger, Margaret E.

2500|$|In relationships, many OA members attested trying <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> {{lives and}} those of others. Paradoxically, an OA member's {{experience}} of themselves was also characterized by strong feelings of personal failure, dependence, despair, stress, nervousness, low self-esteem, powerlessness, lack of control, self-pity, frustration and loneliness. As part of these feelings, the self was perceived as being both a victim of circumstances and {{a victim of the}} attitude of others. Many members viewed this lack of self-esteem as deriving from their external appearance.

2500|$|In the Abrahamic religions, Hell has {{traditionally}} been regarded as a punishment for wrongdoing or sin in this life, {{as a manifestation of}} divine justice.

This view opens the possibility of seeing Hell not as retributive punishment, but rather as an option that God allows, so that people who do not wish to be with God are not forced to be. C. S.
