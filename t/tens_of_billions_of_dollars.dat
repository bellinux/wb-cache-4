25|$|Following the 2011 Japanese Fukushima nuclear disaster, {{authorities}} {{shut down}} the nation's 54 nuclear power plants, {{but it has been}} estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life. As of 2013, the Fukushima site remains highly radioactive, with some 160,000 evacuees still living in temporary housing, and some land will be unfarmable for centuries.

25|$|The loss of 30% of the country's {{generating}} capacity led to much greater reliance on {{liquified natural gas}} and coal. Unusual conservation measures were undertaken. In the immediate aftermath, nine prefectures served by TEPCO experienced power rationing. The government asked major companies to reduce power consumption by 15%, and some shifted their weekends to weekdays to smooth power demand. Converting to a nuclear-free gas and oil energy economy would cost <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> in annual fees. One estimate is that even including the disaster, more lives would have been lost if Japan had used coal or gas plants instead of nuclear.|$|E

25|$|With {{the help}} of {{increasing}} oil revenues, Saddam diversified the largely oil-based Iraqi economy. Saddam implemented a national infrastructure campaign that made great progress in building roads, promoting mining, and developing other industries. The campaign helped Iraq's energy industries. Electricity was brought to nearly every city in Iraq, and many outlying areas. Before the 1970s, most of Iraq's people lived in the countryside and roughly two-thirds were peasants. This number would decrease quickly during the 1970s as global oil prices helped revenues to rise from less than a half billion dollars to <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> and the country invested into industrial expansion.|$|E

He {{initiated}} the construction of the Three Gorges Dam on 14 December 1994, and later began preparations for the Shenzhou Manned Space Program. Both programs were subject to much controversy within China and abroad. The Shenzhou program was especially criticized due to its extraordinary cost (<b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars)</b> in a country that sometimes referred to itself as a Third World nation. Many economists and humanitarians suggested that those billions in capital might be better invested in helping the Chinese population deal with economic hardships and improvement in the China's education, health services, and legal system.|$|E

25|$|The {{early history}} of New Orleans was one of {{uninterrupted}} growth. In the 1850 census, New Orleans ranked as the 6th largest city in the United States, with a population reported as 168,675. It was the only city in the South with over 100,000 people. By 1840 New Orleans had the largest slave market in the nation, which contributed greatly to its wealth. During the antebellum years, two-thirds {{of the more than}} one million slaves who moved from the Upper South in forced migration to the Deep South were taken in the slave trade. Estimates are that the slaves generated an ancillary economy valued at 13.5 percent of the price per person, generating <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> through the years.|$|E
25|$|Saddam {{borrowed}} <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> {{from other}} Arab {{states and a}} few billions from elsewhere during the 1980s to fight Iran, mainly to prevent the expansion of Shi'a radicalism. However, this had proven to completely backfire both on Iraq and {{on the part of}} the Arab states, for Khomeini was widely perceived as a hero for managing to defend Iran and maintain the war with little foreign support against the heavily backed Iraq and only managed to boost Islamic radicalism not only within the Arab states, but within Iraq itself, creating new tensions between the Sunni Ba'ath Party and the majority Shi'a population. Faced with rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure and internal resistance, Saddam desperately re-sought cash, this time for postwar reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|Dwarfing {{the other}} cities in the antebellum South, New Orleans had the nation's largest slave market. The market {{expanded}} after the U.S. ended the international trade in 1808.

The money generated by the sale of slaves in the Upper South has been estimated at 15 percent {{of the value of the}} staple crop economy. The slaves were collectively valued at half a billion dollars. An ancillary economy grew up around the trade—for transportation, housing and clothing, fees, etc., estimated at 13.5 percent of the price per person, amounting to <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> (2005 dollars, adjusted for inflation) during the antebellum period, with New Orleans as a prime beneficiary.|$|E
