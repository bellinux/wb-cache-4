The effects of switching from 5 to 10 °C, and from 10 to 5 °C were also investigated. 17, 20 βP plasma levels were higher at 5 °C than at 10 °C. A switch from 10 to 5 °C stimulated 17, 20 βP secretion, whereas a switch from 5 to 10 °C had the opposite effect. Ovulation occurred spontaneously in the females kept at 5 °C, and in those switched from 10 to 5 °C. In contrast, ovulation was inhibited in females reared at 10 °C, and in those switched from 5 to 10 °C. Oocyte maturation at 5 °C and at 10 °C {{in the presence of}} LH or of 17, 20 βP was also investigated in vitro using donor females reared at 5 or 10 °C. Both LH and 17, 20 βP stimulated oocyte maturation more effectively in oocytes incubated at 5 °C than at 10 °C. At both incubation temperatures, the rearing temperature of <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> <b>females</b> {{had a significant impact on}} their responsiveness to LH stimulation, but had no effect on their responsiveness to 17, 20 βP stimulation. In addition to the inhibition of LH secretion, which had already been reported, the results reported here show that in Arctic charr raising the temperature above the physiological range reduces both follicular responsiveness to LH stimulation and the sensitivity of oocytes to 17, 20 βP stimulation...|$|E

The present study focuses on the differential response of 2 day-old mouse pups of C 57 Bl/ 6 (C) and Balb/C (B) strains to the odor of milk (Experiment 1) and nipples (Experiment 2) that are matched/unmatched in terms of pup's age or strain. In Experiment 1, C and B pups were tested {{in a series of}} tests simultaneously opposing either murine milk and a blank (water), or two milks collected in early and late lactation (lactation days 2 and 15, respectively) from females belonging to their own or the other strain. Results showed that C and B pups were attracted to the odor of the different milks regardless of the lactation age and the strain of the donor female. Nevertheless, C and B pups preferred the odor conveyed by early- than late-lactation milk of either strain. Moreover, early-lactation milk from C females was more attractive than early-lactation milk from B females for pups of either strain. In Experiment 2, differential nipple grasping response of C and B pups was measured when they were exposed to nipples of females in early or late lactation. The proportion of C pups that grasped a nipple was greater when they were exposed to a nipple in early lactation regardless of the strain of <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> <b>females,</b> whereas the proportion of B pups that grasped a nipple was greater when they were exposed to a nipple in early lactation, but only from own strain.

40|$|In living donor liver {{transplantation}} (LDLT), a right liver graft {{is larger}} than a left liver graft and hence leads to better recipient survival. However, in comparison with donor left hepatectomy, donor right hepatectomy carries a higher donor risk. We estimated {{the expansion of the}} applicability of left liver living donor liver transplantation (LLDLT) by lowering the graft weight (GW) /standard liver volume (SLV) ratio in increments of 5 %. Consecutive LDLT cases were included in this study. The results of computed tomography volumetry provided the graft volume measurements, and the GW was derived from the graft volume with the conversion factor of 1. 19 mL/g. We tried to estimate how many more times LLDLT would have been feasible if the GW/SLV requirement had been lowered to 40 %, 35 %, 30 %, or 25 %. In all, 361 consecutive donor-recipient pairs underwent LDLT. Right liver living donor liver transplantation (RLDLT) accounted for 95 % of the LDLT cases. Most recipients were male (74. 2 %), and most <b>donors</b> were <b>female</b> (60. 4 %). The median GW/SLV ratio was 46 % (47 % for RLDLT and 37 % for LLDLT, P < 0. 001). Two of <b>the</b> 218 <b>female</b> <b>donors</b> donated <b>the</b> left liver, and 12 of the 93 female recipients received a left liver. In 147 of the 173 cases (85 %) when <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> was <b>female</b> and <b>the</b> recipient was male, the GW/SLV ratio did not reach 30 %. LLDLT could have been performed more often than 5 % of the time if a lower GW/SLV requirement had been adopted. With GW/SLV ratios ≥ 40 %, ≥ 35 %, ≥ 30 %, and ≥ 25 %, the proportion of LLDLT cases would have risen from 5 % to 5. 8 %, 12. 5 %, 29. 1 %, and 62. 3 %, respectively. LLDLT could have been performed approximately twice as often with every 5 % reduction of the GW/SLV requirement.

40|$|Cross-fostering is an {{assisted}} reproductive {{method that}} has been used to improve the_ productivity of endangered marsupial fauna. Pouch young from endangered species are transferred to the pouch of related common species, allowing <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> <b>female</b> to produce further offspring without going through the entire lactation cycle. In this project I tested the applicability of cross-fostering in rat-kangaroos (family Potoroidae) using the Tasmanian bettong (Bettongia gaimardt) and the Longnosed potoroo (Potorous tridacty/us) as model species. The effect of a 'transfer age difference' (TAD) between transferred young was investigated to determine the most beneficial time for pouch young transfer: optimising both the mother's reproductive rate and young's survival to independence. Thirty two young were transferred, 18 intra-species and 14 inter-species. The transfers were carried out at various stages of pouch life (1 to 11 weeks) with TADs ranging from 0 to 3 weeks. Nutritional analyses were undertaken on 460 milk samples. Growth measurements and development data were obtained for 110 bettong and 46 potoroo young. The effect of cross-fostering on species specific behaviour patterns was investigated using both video-recordings and direct observations. Twenty one young survived and 19 subsequently bred successfully. Milk composition and production rates {{did not appear to be}} affected by transfers. Comparisons of growth rates between cross-fostered and either fostered or untransferred young showed an advantage for cross-fostered potoroos and a disadvantage for cross-fostered bettong. These were most pronounced during the period between pouch vacation and weaning. During asynchronous intraspecies transfers the younger of the two transferees grew faster than untransferred bettong young. The magnitude of both these effects increased with TAD up to an age difference of three weeks when growth related problems appeared. Although cross-fostered young were influenced by transfer mothers' behaviour, they developed normal pecies-specific behaviour. Difficulties in reuniting cross-fostered young with their own species were probably a consequence of different levels of sociability in the two species. At maturity, all surviving transfer young were successful in both mate recognition and production of offspring. Growth and development of the transfer young are affected by the design of the fransfer procedure. The combination of species, temperament and experience of the transfer mother; the age of young at transfer arid the TAD all affect the outcome. The accessibility of the young in the pouch enables progress monitoring and, where required, early intervention for repeated transfers and/or hand-rearing.

Among reported cases, chronic glomerulonephritis is the most common cause, accounting for more than one third of patients, while diabetic nephropathy accounts for< 20 % of all patients in India. Delayed diagnosis and failure to institute measures to slow the pro-gression of renal failure have resulted in a pre-dominantly young ESRD population, with a median age of 44 years. Because of financial constraints, less than one third of all patients referred to a tertiary care center receive any kind of renal replacement therapy. Most hemodialysis patients who stop treatment and die do so because of cost constraints within the first three months, and < 5 % of patients are started on ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Renal transplantation is the cheapest option, but, 10 % of all patients with ESRD have a trans-plant. Cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednis-olone continue to be the backbone of post-transplant immunosuppression, but cyclospor-ine is stopped in a significant proportion of patients at one year post-transplant to cut down costs. Living related donor transplants constitute 70 % of all transplants; two thirds of <b>the</b> <b>donors</b> are <b>females,</b> while more than three fourths of all recipients are males. Spouses account for 20 % of donors from within families. Almost 30 % of transplanted kidneys are donated by living unrelated donors, while cadaver donors ac-count for only 2 %. More resources must be mobilized to care for these patients; early detection of renal disease must be facilitated, and measures to delay ESRD must be imple...|$|R

40|$|Mammalian liver {{is known}} to contain cytosolic receptors for both estrogens and androgens. Furthermore, certain {{mammalian}} hepatic functions are known to display a sexual dimorphism. However, in clinical liver transplantation, the sex of <b>the</b> <b>donor</b> is not taken into consideration in selection of <b>the</b> <b>donor.</b> In this study, the effect of liver transplantation on the estrogen and androgen receptor content of the liver was determined. Adult male and female rats were subjected to orthotopic liver transplantation, using <b>donors</b> form both <b>the</b> same and the opposite sex as the recipient. The animals were killed on the tenth postoperative day, and the livers were assayed to determine their cytosolic estrogen and androgen receptor content. Transplantation of a liver from a male donor into a male recipient, from a male <b>donor</b> into <b>female</b> recipient and from a <b>female</b> <b>donor</b> into a male recipient produced similar changes {{in the number of}} cytosolic estrogen and androgen receptors in hepatic cytosol. In all three situations, the estrogen receptor content in the cytosol of the transplanted liver was the same as that found in an unoperated male liver, and the cytosolic content of the androgen receptor was {{the same as that of}} an unoperated female liver. After transplantation of the liver from a <b>female</b> <b>donor</b> into a <b>female</b> recipient, the estrogen and androgen receptor content in the cytosol of the transplanted liver was the same as that of an unoperated female. A consistent finding in this study was a reduction in the cytosolic androgen receptor activity of the transplanted liver when a male was either <b>the</b> recipient or <b>donor.</b> This reduction was maximal at 10 days posttransplantation. At 40 days following transplantation, a partial recovery in the androgen receptor acitivy of hepatic cytosol had occurred. These studies demonstrate that orthotopic liver transplantation changes the cytosolic content of both the estrogen and androgen receptors of the liver, and their ratios may have important effects during the immediate postoperative period and profound long‐term consequences relative to gender differences in hepatic function.

40|$|Background & objectives: Hepatitis B virus (HBV), human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and syphilis infections pose a great threat to blood safety. This study was undertaken to investigate the seroprevalence of serologic markers for transfusion transmitted infections (TTIs) among blood donors at a hospital based blood centre in north India {{over a period of}} nine years. Methods: The results of serologic markers for TTIs (HBsAg, anti-HCV, anti-HIV and syphilis) of all blood donations (both voluntary and replacement) at our hospital from January 2005 to December 2013 were screened. Additional analysis was conducted to examine the prevalence trends associated with each of the positive marker. Results: The data of 180, 477 donors [173, 019 (95. 86 %) males and 7, 458 (4. 13 %) females] were analyzed. Replacement donations [174, 939 (96. 93 %) ] represented the majority whereas, only 5, 538 (3. 06 %) donations were from <b>the</b> voluntary <b>donors.</b> <b>The</b> risk of blood being reactive was three times higher in male donors when compared with <b>the</b> <b>female</b> <b>donors.</b> <b>The</b> risk of blood being reactive for one or more infectious markers was 2. 1 times higher in replacement donors when compared with <b>the</b> voluntary <b>donors.</b> Seropositivity of HIV, HBsAg, HBcAb, syphilis showed a significant decreasing trend (P< 0. 05) while there was an increasing trend in HCV infection which was insignificant. Interpretation & conclusions: This study reflects that the risk of TTIs has been decreased over time with respect to HIV, HBV and syphilis, but the trends for HCV remains almost the same in blood donors. Blood transfusion remains a risk factor for the spread of blood-borne infections. Therefore, improvements are needed to strengthen both safety and availability of blood...|$|R
40|$|Living kidney {{donation}} {{continues as}} {{the cornerstone of}} transplantation. In order to determine with ever-renewing assurance that living donation is safe for <b>the</b> <b>donor,</b> we need to periodically review the literature, review the United Network for Organ Sharing database for donor characteristics that may put them in danger, and scour databases for donors starting dialysis and/or listed for transplant. Additionally, we must encourage financing studies that follow large diverse cohorts of donors over their entire lifetimes in order to detect key characteristics that influence outcomes. Currently, it can be stated that living donation is, on the whole, safe, with few perioperative deaths, complications, or long-term medical issues. Additionally, <b>the</b> living <b>donor</b> reflects <b>the</b> demographics {{of the general population}} including increased rates of obesity with some donors having hypertension and low-grade proteinuria. In the long run, death rates (for <b>the</b> white <b>donor)</b> are no different than for the general population, whereas end-stage renal disease rates are slightly increased over the general population, ranging from 0. 1 % to 1. 1 %. The higher risk is especially notable in <b>the</b> black <b>donor.</b> Preeclampsia in <b>female</b> <b>donors</b> may also be marginally greater than in those with 2 kidneys.

40|$|Eight {{patients}} with skin {{coverage of the}} hand by the distally based posterior interosseous island flap (DBPIIF) are presented.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of embryo banking for rat and mousemodels of human disease and normal biological pro-cesses {{depends on the}} ease of obtaining embryos. Authors report {{on the effect of}} genotype on embryo produc-tion and rederivation. In an effort to establish banks of cryopreserved embryos, they provide two databases for com-paring banking efficiency: one that contains the embryo col-lection results from approximately 11, 000 rat embryo donors (111 models) and another that contains the embryo collec-tion results from 4, 023 mouse embryo donors (57 induced mutant models). <b>The</b> genotype of <b>donor</b> <b>females</b> affected <b>the</b> {{efficiency of}} embryo collection in two ways. First, the pro-portion of females yielding embryos varied markedly among genotypes (rats: 16 - 100 %, mean= 71 %; mice: 24 - 95 %, mean= 65 %). Second, the mean number of embryos recov-ered from females yielding embryos varied considerably (rats: 4 - 10. 6, mean= 7. 8; mice 5. 3 - 32. 2, mean= 13. 7). Geno-type also affected the efficiency of rederivation of banked rat and mouse embryos models by embryo transfer. For rats, thawed embryos («= 684) from 33 genotypes were transferred into 66 recipient females (pregnancy rate: 76 %). The aver-age rate of developing live newborns for individual rat geno-types was 30 % with a range of 10 to 58 %. For mice, thawed embryos (n= 2, 064) from 59 genotypes were transferred into 119 pseudopregnant females (pregnancy rate: 78 %). The average rate of development of individual mouse genotypes was 33 % with a range of 11 to 53 %.

50|$|Often times females mate voluntarily {{with more}} than one male. Mating with several males reduces the risk of females having un{{fertilize}}d eggs because one male may not have enough sperm to fertilize all her eggs. In dark-eyed juncos, a female mates {{with more than}} one male because often times, her social partner is of low genetic quality than other potential sperm <b>donors.</b> <b>The</b> <b>females</b> voluntarily mate with other males besides their mate because she sees the potential to improve her offspring viability and sexual attractiveness. Females may also mate with several males for genetic benefits such as genetic diversity among her offspring due to the variety of sperm available to her. In song birds, extra-pair matings occur because females are able to sneak away from their home territories to solicit to other males. When female song birds seek extra-male partners, they sexually select males with colorful plumage more elaborate than those of their social partner. Studies show that female song birds that have less plumage partners most actively seek extra-pair matings, furthermore males with the most developed traits—such as longer tails or brighter plumage survive better. Thus, when female song birds have multiple mating partners, they are increasing the genetic quality of their offspring.|$|R
