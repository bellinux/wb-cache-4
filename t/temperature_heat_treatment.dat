50|$|The {{start point}} is a single steel tube of {{internal}} diameter slightly less than the desired calibre. The tube is subjected to internal pressure of sufficient magnitude to enlarge the bore {{and in the process}} the inner layers of the metal are stretched in tension beyond their elastic limit. This means that the inner layers have been stretched to a point where the steel is no longer able to return to its original shape once the internal pressure has been removed. Although the outer layers of the tube are also stretched, the degree of internal pressure applied during the process is such that they are not stretched beyond their elastic limit. The reason why this is possible is that the stress distribution through the walls of the tube is non-uniform. Its maximum value occurs in the metal adjacent to the source of pressure, decreasing markedly towards the outer layers of the tube. The strain is proportional to the stress applied within elastic limit; therefore the expansion at the outer layers is less than at the bore. Because the outer layers remain elastic they attempt to return to their original shape; however, they are prevented from doing so completely by the now permanently stretched inner layers. The effect is that the inner layers of the metal are put under compression by the outer layers {{in much the same way}} as though an outer layer of metal had been shrunk on as with a built-up gun. The next step is to subject the compressively strained inner layers to a low <b>temperature</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> which results in the elastic limit being raised to at least the autofrettage pressure employed in the first stage of the process. Finally the elasticity of the barrel can be tested by applying internal pressure once more, but this time care is taken to ensure that the inner layers are not stretched beyond their new elastic limit. The end result is an inner surface of the gun barrel with a residual compressive stress able to counterbalance the tensile stress that would be induced when the gun is discharged. In addition the material has a higher tensile stress as a result of the heat treatment process.|$|E

As-milled and heat treated products were characterised using techniques of combustion analysis, X-ray diffractometry (XRD), selected area electron diffracton (SAED) and high resolution {{transmission electron microscopy}} (HRTEM). Both the mechanisms of hydrogen uptake and of hydrogen evolution during subsequent heat treatment {{were found to be}} dependent on the mode of milling. Samples milled under a ball-particle impact mode absorbed more hydrogen (2. 7 wt%) than the samples milled under shearing mode, but the fraction of hydrogen released during subsequent low <b>temperature</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> (220 - 500 ºC) was significantly less than for the samples milled under shear. XRD of the shear milled product showed increased, but varying c-axis lattice parameters while XRD of the impact milled product showed complete loss of (002) graphite and formation of peaks which could be associated with CnHx species. Low <b>temperature</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> of the shear milled product resulted in significant disorder in the graphite structure, characterised by a loss of diffraction peak contrast and high background scattering in both XRD and selected area electron diffraction patterns. In contrast there was little change in XRD patterns from impact milled samples during low <b>temperature</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatment.</b> For the shear milled samples which were heat treated for short times there was also an associated loss of contrast from graphene layers in HRTEM images, however, HRTEM contrast from samples shear milled and heat treated for longer times showed an increased fraction of graphene sheets in the product. It was concluded that hydrogen uptake under impact mode milling was predominately via an irreversible mechanism involving destruction of graphene sheets and reaction to from product including CnHx -type molecules. However, hydrogen uptake under shearing mode milling occurred via a partially reversible mechanism involving absorption between graphite layers and expansion of the graphite inter-sheet spacing...|$|E

The {{supercritical}} material F 92 {{steel is}} regarded as the research object, and the influence law of <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> process on its tissue and properties is analyzed. The results show that when the <b>temperature</b> of <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> quenching and tempering is too low, a large number of alloying elements cannot be fully integrated into the austenite, and the optimal obdurability of F 92 steel is still not fully exploited; while too high <b>temperature</b> of <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> quenching and tempering will weaken the strength, plasticity and toughness. When F 92 steel is processed by heating quenching at 1050 ℃ and tempering at 680 ℃, its tissue is the smaller tempered lath martensite.

The high <b>temperature</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> of wood {{is one of these}} commercially viable and environmentally friendly alternative wood modification technologies. During this treatment, wood is heated to temperatures above 200 °C by contacting it with hot gas. The chemical structure of wood changes leading to increased dimensional stability and resistance to microorganisms. Wood darkens making it aesthetically more attractive.

40|$|Selective Laser Melting (SLM) shows a big {{potential}} among metal {{additive manufacturing}} (AM) technologies. However, the large thermal gradients {{and the local}} melting and solidification processes of SLM result {{in the presence of}} a significant amount of residual stresses in the as built parts. These internal stresses will not only affect mechanical properties, but also increase the risk of Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC). A twister used in an air extraction pump of a condenser to create a swirl in the water, was chosen as a candidate component to be produced by SLM in 316 L stainless steel. Since the main expected damage mechanism of this component in service is corrosion, corrosion tests were carried out on an as-built twister as well as on heat treated components. It was shown that a low <b>temperature</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> at 450 °C had only a limited effect on the residual stress reduction and concomitant corrosion properties, while the internal stresses were significantly reduced when a high <b>temperature</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatment</b> at 950 °C was applied.

40|$|The. use of high-chromium {{cast irons}} for {{abrasive}} wear resistance is restricted {{due to their}} poor fracture toughness properties. An. {{attempt was made to}} improve the fracture characteristics by altering the distribution, size and. shape of the eutectic carbide phase without sacrificing their excellent wear resistance. This was achieved by additions of molybdenum or tungsten followed by high <b>temperature</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatments.</b> The absence of these alloying elements or replacement of them with vanadium or manganese did not show any significant effect and the continuous eutectic carbide morphology remained the same after application of high <b>temperature</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatments.</b> The fracture characteristics of the alloys with these metallurgical variables were evaluated for both sharp-cracks and blunt notches. The results were used in conjunction with metallographic and fractographic observations to establish possible failure mechanisms. The fracture mechanism of the austenitic alloys was found to be controlled not only by the volume percent but was also greatly influenced by the size and distribution of the eutectic carbides. On the other hand, the fracture mechanism of martensitic alloys was independent of the eutectic carbide morphology. The uniformity of the secondary carbide precipitation during hardening <b>heat</b> <b>treatments</b> was shown to be a reason for consistant fracture toughness results being obtained with this series of alloys although their eutectic carbide morphologies were different. The collected data were applied to a model which incorporated the microstructural parameters and correlated them with the experimentally obtained valid stress intensity factors.
