5|$|The {{magnetosphere}} of Jupiter {{is responsible}} for intense episodes of radio emission from the planet's polar regions. Volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io (see below) injects gas into Jupiter's magnetosphere, producing a torus of particles about the planet. As Io moves through this torus, the interaction generates Alfvén waves that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter. As a result, radio waves are generated through a cyclotron maser mechanism, and <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> <b>transmitted</b> out along a cone-shaped surface.

The method transfers energy using the principle of capacitive coupling (like a condenser) of radio waves of 13,56-MHz. No external shielding is needed. Oncothermia utilizes the special absorption rate of the near-membrane extracellular liquid of the tumor. The tumor tissue has lower impedance than the surrounding tissues, so most of <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> <b>transmitted</b> and absorbed by the cancerous lesion. This selection of the tumour tissues (self-focusing) renders external focusing unnecessary.|$|E

50|$|If {{the wave}} height (the {{difference}} between wave crest and wave trough) {{is larger than}} the stroke length, the translator will reach a standstill at the lower end stop. At the upper end stop the wave flushes over the buoy and at the lower the line slackens. In both of these cases no power is produced (voltage induced) until the translator starts to move again. This happens when the wave is lower than the buoy’s top position in the upper state, and in the lower state when the wave has risen so much that the buoy once again starts to pull the translator upwards.

50|$|The KRISS Vector {{uses the}} KRISS Super V Recoil Mitigation System, {{that is an}} {{articulated}} mechanism which allows the bolt and an inertia block to move downward into a recess behind the magazine well.

When fired, the barrel axis is in line with the shoulder as in the M16 rifle, but also in line with the shooter's hand. This is intended to reduce muzzle climb when combined with the off-axis bolt travel, though it also greatly raise the sight line in comparison to the bore axis.

The birth {{of the theory of}} sonics [...] can be considered the publication of the book A treatise on transmission of power by vibrations in 1918 by the Romanian scientist Gogu Constantinescu.ONE of the fundamental problems of mechanical engineering is that of transmitting energy found in nature, after suitable transformation, to some point at which can be made available for performing useful work. The methods of transmitting power known and practised by engineers are broadly included in two classes: mechanical including hydraulic, pneumatic and wire rope methods; and electrical methods....According to the new system, energy is transmitted from one point to another, which may be at a considerable distance, by means of impressed variations of pressure or tension producing longitudinal vibrations in solid, liquid or gaseous columns. <b>The</b> <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> <b>transmitted</b> by periodic changes of pressure and volume in the longitudinal direction and may be described as wave transmission of power, or mechanical wave transmission.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} nonlinear waves is reported {{for a system}} of one-dimensional second sound waves in superfluid helium within a cylindrical resonator of high Q quality factor.

The restricted geometry of the resonator results in a discrete energy spectrum, where <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> <b>transmitted</b> from the driving frequency to the high-frequency edge of the spectrum, where dissipation occurs—a Kolmogorov-like energy distribution. It is found that the main resonance occurs at the driving frequency, and that the next few harmonics are approximately sinusoidal, coherent with the driving force, but that higher harmonics appear to be chaotic and are no longer phase coherent with the drive. For developed turbulence, the probability density function of the high-frequency harmonics is well approximated by a Gaussian distribution.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of internal solitary waves (ISWs) propagating in a rotating channel is studied numerically {{in the framework}} of a fully-nonlinear, nonhydrostatic numerical model. The aim of modelling efforts was the investigation of strongly-nonlinear effects, which are beyond the applicability of weakly nonlinear theories. Results reveal that small-amplitude waves and sufficiently strong ISWs evolve differently under the action of rotation. At the first stage of evolution an initially two-dimensional ISW transforms according to the scenario described by the rotation modified Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, namely, it starts to evolve into a Kelvin wave (with exponential decay of the wave amplitude across the channel) with front curved backwards.
