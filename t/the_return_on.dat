5|$|The {{maritime}} fur {{trade was}} dominated by American traders from the 1790s to the 1820s. Between 1788 and 1826, American merchant ships made at least 127 voyages between the United States and China, via the Northwest Coast. The returns were lucrative. During the late 1810s, <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> investment ranged from about 300% to 500%. Even higher profits were common {{in the first decade}} of the 19th century. Returns of 2,200% or higher were common, although when taking into account the cost of buying and outfitting vessels, the 2,200% return would be closer to 525%.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E

5|$|The Bears won {{the coin}} toss and {{deferred}} {{until the second}} half. The Bears special teams unit struggled, with returner Marc Mariani muffing <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> both of the Vikings' first two punts. Despite this, the Bears took the lead with Robbie Gould's 55-yard field goal. However, Minnesota scored on Marcus Sherels's 65-yard punt return touchdown, the third return touchdown allowed by the Bears in 2015. Despite this, Sherels muffed his return on the ensuing punt; Blair Walsh eventually kicked a 43-yard field goal {{in the second quarter}} to make the score 10–3. After the game's next three drives ended in punts (twice by the Bears), the first turnover of the game occurred when Kyle Fuller intercepted Bridgewater's pass for Stefon Diggs. The Bears capitalized on the takeaway with Cutler's 21-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery, who jumped over Rhodes to make the catch in the left corner of the endzone. In the third quarter, the Bears reclaimed the lead with Gould's 33-yard field goal, and after the Vikings punted, had the chance to increase the margin to six points on Gould's 51-yard attempt. However, Gould's kick went wide left, his first miss of the season and ending a 17-kick streak. Minnesota took advantage by tying the game via Walsh's 48-yard field goal. The game's next two possessions ended with touchdowns for both teams: the Bears scored with Cutler, whose targets (Jeffery and Mariani) were unavailable, running four yards and colliding with safety Harrison Smith at the goal line for the touchdown. Afterwards, the Vikings tied the score with Bridgewater throwing a pass to Diggs, who escaped Sherrick McManis to score on the 40-yard play. With 1:49 left in the game, the Bears' next drive ended with a punt to the Vikings' 22-yard line. However, aided by Bridgewater's 35-yard pass to Charles Johnson, Walsh kicked a 36-yard field goal as time expired to seal the win.|$|E

40|$|This article studies {{equilibrium}} asset pricing when agents face nonnegative wealth constraints. In {{the presence}} of these constraints it is shown that options on the market portfolio are nonredundant securities and the economy's pricing kernel is a function of both the market portfolio and the nonredundant options. This implies that the options should be useful for explaining risky asset <b>returns.</b> To test <b>the</b> theory, a model is derived in which <b>the</b> expected excess <b>return</b> <b>on</b> any risky asset is linearly related (via a collection of betas) to <b>the</b> expected excess <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market portfolio and to <b>the</b> expected excess <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nonredundant options.

25|$|A {{synthetic}} ETF has counterparty risk, {{because the}} counterparty is contractually obligated to match <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> the index.

Furthermore, the investment bank could use its own trading desk as counterparty. These types of set-ups are not allowed under the European guidelines, Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS), so the investor should look for UCITS III-compliant funds.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} infrastructural {{investments}} in the energy sector, developing storage facilities is capital intensive.

It {{has been estimated that}} investors require a rate or return between 12 percent to 15 percent for regulated projects, and close to 20 percent for unregulated projects. The higher expected return from unregulated projects is due to the higher perceived market risk. In addition significant expenses are accumulated during the planning and location of potential storage sites to determine its suitability, which further increases the risk.|$|E

50|$|In finance, {{a common}} {{approach}} for measuring risk premia {{is to compare}} <b>the</b> risk-free <b>return</b> <b>on</b> T-bills and <b>the</b> risky <b>return</b> <b>on</b> other investments (using <b>the</b> ex post <b>return</b> {{as a proxy for}} the ex ante expected <b>return).</b> <b>The</b> difference between these two returns can be interpreted as a measure of <b>the</b> excess expected <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> risky asset.

25|$|Under this scheme, {{the foreign}} partner {{that makes the}} initial {{investment}} can repatriate <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> the investment (at a pre-agreed fixed rate) through goods and services produced by the project.

In the medium to long-term, more appropriate laws and regulations will probably replace the buy-back scheme. In other words, once the constitutional concerns have been dealt with, the foreign partners of buy-back agreements can take over the projects that they are involved in, or they can enter into a joint venture with an Iranian partner.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{experience}} with barcode scanning in those stores revealed additional benefits. The detailed sales information {{acquired by the}} new systems allowed greater responsiveness to customer habits, needs and preferences. This {{was reflected in the}} fact that about 5 weeks after installing barcode scanners, sales in grocery stores typically started climbing and eventually leveled off at a 10–12% increase in sales that never dropped off. There was also a 1–2% decrease in operating cost for those stores, and this enabled them to lower prices and thereby to increase market share. It was shown in the field that <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> investment for a barcode scanner was 41.5%. By 1980, 8,000 stores per year were converting.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} way to understand the aggregation problem does not involve the Classical pricing equations. Think about {{a decrease in the}} r, <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> capital (corresponding to a rise in w, the wage rate, given that initial levels of capital and technology stay constant). This causes a change in the distribution of income, the nature of the various capital goods demanded, and thus a change in their prices. This causes a change in the value of K (as discussed above). So, again, the rate of return on K (i.e., r) is not independent of the measure of K, as assumed in the neoclassical model of growth and distribution. Causation goes both ways, from K to r and from r to K. This problem is sometimes seen as analogous to the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu results (e.g., by Mas-Colell 1989) in general equilibrium theory, which shows that representative agent models cannot be theoretically justified, except under restrictive conditions (see Kirman, 1992 for an explanation of the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu results as an aggregation problem). Note that this says that it's not simply K that is subject to aggregation problems: so is L.|$|E
