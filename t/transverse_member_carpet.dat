40|$|Bearing reinforcement, {{which is}} {{composed}} of a longitudinal member (steel deformed bar) and <b>transverse</b> (bearing) <b>members</b> (a set of equal angle steel), has been established as an effective earth reinforcement material. The equation for estimating the pullout resistance of this reinforcement in coarse-grained soils has been previously developed. The usage of locally available soils as a backfill is particularly cost effective for construction sites {{where there is a}} lack of available quality materials. The pullout resistance mechanism of the bearing reinforcement embedded in cohesive-frictional soils with various fine contents is presented in this paper. The total pullout resistance is the sum of the pullout friction and bearing resistances. The pullout friction resistance is approximated from soil shear strength and interaction factor a, which is linearly related to fine content. The bearing pullout resistance of a single isolated <b>transverse</b> <b>member</b> can be approximated from the modified punching shear mechanism where the failure plane angle, b is primarily dependent upon fine content. The relationship between b and fine content is expressed by a polynomial function. The b value of p= 2 is suggested for fine contents less than 45 %. The <b>transverse</b> <b>member</b> interference is classified into three zones, depending upon spacing and dimension of <b>transverse</b> <b>member,</b> S/B ratio. The larger softened region caused by <b>transverse</b> <b>member</b> interference develops with smaller fine content. Based on a critical analysis of the test results, the pullout resistance equations for bearing reinforcement with different normal stresses, dimensions and spacing of <b>transverse</b> <b>members</b> embedded in different cohesiveefrictional soils compacted at optimum point (optimum water content and maximum dry unit weight) are developed in term of total strength parameters.

40|$|The {{effect of}} molding water {{contents}} (on dry and wet sides of optimum water content) on the pullout resistance {{mechanism of the}} bearing reinforcement embedded in a marginal lateritic soil is investigated in this paper. The total pullout resistance is contributed from the pullout friction and bearing resistances. The pullout friction resistance is approximated from the soil shear strength and interaction factor, α. The peak and residual interaction factors (α p and α r) are independent of molding water contents tested and are approximately 0. 63 and 0. 46, respectively. The bearing pullout resistance of a single isolated <b>transverse</b> <b>member</b> is dependent upon both shear strength and failure mode and can be approximated from the modified punching shear solution with various angles of transformation, β. The β values of the compacted soil at 0. 67 ≤w/wOWC≤ 1. 0 are essentially constant and equal to π/ 2 (where w OWC is the optimum water content). For 1. 0 OWC. The failure mechanism of the bearing reinforcement is classified into three zones (block, interference and individual), depending upon spacing and dimension of <b>transverse</b> <b>member,</b> S/B ratio. The <b>transverse</b> <b>member</b> interference zone is independent of water content when 0. 67 ≤w/wOWC≤ 1. 0 and decreases as w/w OWC increases when 1. 0 <w/wOWC≤ 1. 33.

40|$|Due to the {{economic}} and ecologic advantages of geogrids, this kind of geosynthetic material has been widely used in practice to reinforce various soil structures. Geogrid reinforcing effects are performed via the interaction of geogrids together with the surrounding soil. In order to improve the understanding of geogrid–soil interaction, discrete element modeling (DEM) based on 2 D software Particle Flow Code (PFC 2 D) {{was carried out in}} this study. Compared with 3 D modeling, 2 D investigations have the particular advantage of giving insights into key mechanisms with less computational time. In the numerical modeling of unbonded soil particles, a new iterative approach was suggested for the determination of reasonable 2 D porosities in DEM studies. In the DEM investigations of geogrids, a piecewise linear model was developed to characterize the nonlinear tensile behavior of geogrids. Based on the developed models of soil and geogrids, the geogrid-soil interaction was investigated under different experimental loading conditions. In the numerical compound tensile tests, the frictional interaction between one geogrid tensile member and soil was visualized by the force development and soil particle rotations in the specimen. Based on the discrete element modeling of geogrid pullout tests, the bearing resistance caused by the geogrid <b>transverse</b> <b>members</b> was obtained. The numerically obtained normal stress distribution in the geogrid plane was found to be not constant with increasing clamp displacement but on average in agreement with the prescribed normal stress. In the DEM investigations of biaxial compression tests, the compound stress-strain behavior of geogrid reinforced specimen was significantly improved with increasing number of geogrid longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>members.</b> The geogrid reinforcement mechanisms were visualized by the kinematic behavior and load transfer behavior of unreinforced and reinforced specimens. Besides the DEM investigations under each single experimental load, the developed DEM models were applied in the numerical modeling of real geogrid reinforced soil structures under combined loading conditions.

The magnitude of bearing stress is mainly controlled by H. The lateral movement pattern is primarily dependent upon S v for a particular H. The inward movement exists for small S v value while the outward movement exists for large S v value. The magnitude of lateral movement is controlled by E, T, L and n. For a particular foundation condition (E and T), an increase in n is more advantageous than an increase in L because the lateral movement is insignificantly reduced when L/H H/ 2.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A fiber-optic sensor {{was used}} to {{investigate}} the modal response of a highly-flexible graphite/bismaleimide lattice structure. The natural frequencies and modal amplitudes were determined based on strain readings taken from the structurally-integrated fiber-optic sensor. The advanced composite lattice structure to which the sensor was attached is a half-scale model of the aluminum grid currently being used for active control studies at the Air Force Astronautics Laboratory. The dynamically-scaled compos-ite lattice structure, which employs 2. 604 -cm (1. 025 -inches) wide strips to form a five-by-five grid, is 76. 52 -cm (30. 125 -inches) square overall with a nominal thickness of 0. 094 cm (0. 037 inches). The longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>members</b> employ the same seven-ply [O 3 / 90]s stacking sequence with reference to their local coordinate system, except at the intersections, where the layers are alternated. The scaled lattice structure was fabricated from G 40 - 600 / 5245 C graphite/bismaleimide prepreg tape. The first seven modes from an ANSYS finite element model based on eight-node quadrilateral shell elements were used to optimize {{the path of the}} integral fiber-optic sensor. To form this sensor, an optical fiber was bonded to the surface along an "L"-shaped path and spliced into the sensor arm of a modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which provides a voltage proportional to sensor elongation to supply real-time integrated strain data. The structure was cantilevered verti-cally from a specially-designed vise, and the natural frequencies and modal amplitudes of the lattice structure were measured using the integral fiber-optic strain sensor. The ex-perimental results were confirmed with noncontact proximity sensors.

40|$|In {{the finite}} element {{modelling}} of steel frames, external loads usually act along the members {{rather than at}} the nodes only. Conventionally, when a member is subjected to these transverse loads, they are converted to nodal forces which act at the ends of the elements into which the member is discretised by either lumping or consistent nodal load approaches. For a contemporary geometrically non-linear analysis in which the axial force in the member is large, accurate solutions are achieved by discretising the member into many elements, which can produce unfavourable consequences on the efficacy of the method for analysing large steel frames. Herein, a numerical technique to include the transverse loading in the non-linear stiffness formulation for a single element is proposed, and which is able to predict the structural responses of steel frames involving the effects of first-order member loads as well as the second-order coupling effect between the transverse load and the axial force in the member. This allows for a minimal discretisation of a frame for second-order analysis. For those conventional analyses which do include <b>transverse</b> <b>member</b> loading, prescribed stiffness matrices must be used for the plethora of specific loading patterns encountered. This paper shows, however, that the principle of superposition {{can be applied to the}} equilibrium condition, so that the form of the stiffness matrix remains unchanged with only the magnitude of the loading being needed to be changed in the stiffness formulation. This novelty allows for a very useful generalised stiffness formulation for a single higher-order element with arbitrary transverse loading patterns to be formulated. The results are verified using analytical stability function studies, as well as with numerical results reported by independent researchers on several simple structural frames...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical simulation of the bearing reinforcement earth wall by PLAXIS 2 D. The bearing reinforcement {{was regarded as}} a cost-effective earth reinforcement. The model parameters for the simulation were obtained from the conventional laboratory tests and back analyses from the laboratory pullout tests of the bearing reinforcement. The simplified method for modeling the bearing reinforcement, which converts the contribution of friction and bearing resistance to the equivalent friction resistance, is introduced. This method is considered to be acceptable and practical in working state with sufficient factor of safety and small pullout displacement. The bearing reinforcement is modeled as the geotextile and the equivalent friction resistance is represented by the soil/reinforcement interface parameter, R, which was obtained from a back analysis of the laboratory pullout test results. The R values are 0. 65 and 0. 75 for the bearing reinforcement with 2 and 3 <b>transverse</b> <b>members,</b> respectively. The change in bearing stresses, settlements, lateral earth pressures and tensions in the reinforcements during and after construction is simulated. Overall, the simulated test results are in good agreement with the measured ones. The simulated results show that the BRE wall behaves as a rigid body, retaining the unreinforced backfill. The simulated bearing stress {{presents a}} trapezoid distribution shape as generally assumed by the conventional method of examination of the external stability of MSE walls. The simulated settlement is almost uniform due to a high stiffness of the rigid foundation and the bearing reinforcements. The maximum lateral movement occurs at about the mid-height of the wall, resulting in the bi-linear maximum tension plane. The knowledge gained from this study can be applied to other BRE walls with different wall heights, foundations and features of bearing reinforcements...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1970 ’s geogrids {{are being}} used for soil {{reinforcement}} in all fields of geotechnics as in bearing layers under transportation ways and foundations and as in slopes. Generally, it is the goal to build these bearing layers stiffer and these slopes steeper than possible with a locally available soil without additives. The reinforcement of locally available soils additionally leads to more economic and sustainable constructions. Surface-parallel geogrids in slopes, as in veneer cover systems, e. g., of landfills, take up the downward-directed part of the top soil’s weight. Hence, the geogrid tensile force increases along the slope from bottom to top. This high tensile force has to be anchored within a small area at the top, which is often carried out in anchorage trenches. The current design of the German EBGEO (2010) regards only the ultimate and not the serviceability limit state, {{and is based on}} some assumptions that, based on this work and e. g. BAM (2012), are rated to be too simplifying. Additionally, the design does not comprise a proof of the junctions between longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> tensile <b>members</b> of the grids, although these are being loaded regularly. Especially in regard to landfill constructions with their required endurance of 100 years, a design model should be sufficiently detailed and conservative (Koerner 2012 a, p. 454). Due to these arguments, the execution of anchorage trenches in landfill constructions in Germany is currently restricted. Therefore, in this work a mechanically based model for the design of anchorage trenches with geogrids, taking into account all decisive effects, was developed to resolve the uncertainties of the current design after EBGEO (2010). After a comprehensive literature review, the nonlinear influences on the pullout behavior of normal stress, number of <b>transverse</b> <b>members,</b> soil type and soil density were quantified with pullout tests using four geogrid products and three soils. Basing on these findings, a mechanically based interaction model for horizontal anchorage was developed that combines various existing approaches and takes into account the load transfer mechanisms of friction on the surfaces of the longitudinal tensile members as well as bearing in front of the <b>transverse</b> tensile <b>members.</b> For use in an anchorage trench with a non-horizontal but deviated geogrid alignment, this model had to be upgraded. Therefore, approaches to take into account deviation effects and different possible failure mechanisms were combined with the interaction model for horizontal anchorage. With its mechanically based approaches for the interaction, the deviation effects and the failure mechanisms and due to its successful validation, this model could be used for modeling the resistance mobilization of geogrids in anchorage trenches. With the developed anchorage trench model, the design approach of EBGEO (2010) was checked with characteristic calculations within a parametric study. The comparison showed that the deviations along the geogrid led to an increase in resistance and in stiffness of anchorage trenches. In almost all cases, the failure mechanism sliding with only resistance forces at the bottom side of the geogrid was decisive, which is not considered in the current design practice. In total, the design of EBGEO (2010), even when considering the mechanism sliding, tended to unsafe results for anchorage trenches with lower stiffness. In order to still be able to safely design with the approach of EBGEO (2010), the resulting resistance has to be reduced by a model factor of γMF,EBGEO = 1. 67. Only for anchorage trenches with higher stiffness of kR ≥ 1820 kPa, EBGEO design leads to safe results without the model factor. However, in almost all cases, design with EBGEO (2010) and the model factor is not economic. For safe and, at the same time, economic design of geogrid anchorage trenches, the model was incorporated into a design concept, which was based on the existing design concept for anchorage trenches. For the known proofs of the ultimate limit state, the model gives the design resistance, while the tensile force resulting {{at the top of the}} slope, as design action, can still be determined according to EBGEO (2010). Additionally, the design model comprises two proofs against failure of the junctions between longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> tensile <b>members</b> (shear resistance and maximum allowable displacement), for which the model calculates the design actions. For the first time, with the developed model a design of the serviceability limit state is possible. For these, the model calculates the geogrid displacement at the top of the slope for the regarded load case as design action. To be able to use the design model for design of the ultimate limit state not only with the written code and the software Matlab, but also with a simple spreadsheet calculation, it was simplified by a coarse discretization of the geogrid into only three sections. The resulting reduced accuracy of the simplified design model is taken into account using a stiffness-dependent model factor that was defined. Thereby, a safe design of the ultimate limit state is possible with the simplified design model as well as the detailed design model, in contrast to design with EBGEO (2010), including a proof of the geogrid junctions. By introduction of a model factor for the approach of EBGEO (2010), design using EBGEO (2010) is still possible. However, this design is less economic than using the presented new design models. Additionally, with the detailed design model, for the first time, a design of the serviceability limit state is possible...|$|R

40|$|Cylindrical {{shells of}} {{arbitrary}} section, reinforced by longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>members</b> (stringers and ribs) are considered by us, for a sufficiently close spacing of the ribs, {{as in our}} previously published papers (references 1 end 2), as thin-walled orthotropic spatial systems at the cross-sections of which only axial (normal and shearing) forces can arise. The longitudinal bending and twisting moments, due to their weak effect on the stress state of the shell, are taken equal to zero. Along the longitudinal sections of the shell there may arise transverse forces {{in addition to the}} normal ~d shearing forces. Under the so-called static assumptions there is taken for the computation model of the shell a thin-walled spatial system consisting along its length (along a generator) of an infinite number of elementary strips capable of bending. Each of these strips is likened to a curved rod operating in each of its sections not only in tension (compression) but also in transverse bending and shear. The interaction between two adjoining transverse strips in the shell expresses itself in the transmission from one strip to the other of only the normal and shearing stresses. The static structure of the computation model here described is shown in figure 1, where the connections through which the normal and shearing stresses transmitted from one transverse strip to smother are indicated schematically by the rods located in the middle surface of the shell. In addition to the static hypothesis we introduce also geometric hypotheses. According to the latter the elongational deformations of the shell along lines parallel to the generator of its middle surface and the shear deformations in the middle surface, as ma+gitudes having. little effect {{on the state of the}} fundamental internal forces of the shell, are taken equal to zero. The deformations of the shell in our computational model are such that in the first place the lines of this surface perpendicular to the generator are inextensible at each point end in the second place the angles between the lines of principal curvature (the coordinate lines) which are straight before the deformation remain straight after the deformation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} study was to evaluate the fatigue strength of welded diaphragm-to-beam connections. Experimental tests were performed {{in order to determine}} the fatigue resistance of the detail, examine failure modes, and to evaluate repair methods. Two diaphragm configurations were studied: one with diaphragms positioned back-to-back and one with staggered diaphragms. The experimental results indicate that the back-to-back diaphragms distribute load laterally more than the staggered diaphragms. The back-to-back configuration provides stiffness to the beam web and acts as a continuous <b>transverse</b> <b>member.</b> Because of the stiffness, many of the web and flange welds connecting the diaphragm to the beam fractured for the non-staggered diaphragms that resulted in decreased load transfer. Horizontal cracking also developed in the beam webs but did not affect the fatigue strength of the beam. The staggered diaphragms do not stiffen the beam web, but pull the beam web out-of-plane causing high out-of-plane bending stresses to develop. In the staggered diaphragm tests, cracks perpendicular to the stress field developed in the beam webs at the toe of a bottom flange weld. However, the beams did not fracture immediately. The repair methods investigated were removing the diaphragm and drilling holes at the beam crack tips, removing the diaphragm and peening the bottom flange weld toes, and leaving the diaphragm in place and peening the bottom flange weld toes. Peening the bottom flange weld toes before fatigue cracks developed did prevent cracks from forming for both diaphragm configurations. When a crack was present in the beam web, drilling holes at the crack tips arrested the crack growth. Finite element models of the welded diaphragm-to-beam connection were developed {{in order to determine the}} stresses near the welds. The stresses were then used in a crack propagation model that predicts the fatigue life of cracked beam members that have the welded diaphragm connection. Based upon the experimental and analytical results, it has been shown that beam members that develop cracks have a long fatigue life. Also, repair methods are effective in extending the fatigue life of a beam member once cracks develop and before the onset of cracks. ...|$|R
50|$|Structures {{involves}} {{selection of}} material of construction, structural analysis of global and local {{strength of the}} vessel, vibration of the structural components and structural responses of the vessel during motions in seaway. Depending {{on the type of}} ship, the structure and design will vary in what material to use as well as how much of it some ships are made from glass reinforced plastics but the vast majority are steel with possibly some aluminium in the superstructure. The complete structure of the ship is designed with panels shaped in a rectangular form consisting of steel plating supported on four edges. Combined in a large surface area the Grillages create the hull of the ship, deck, and bulkheads while still providing mutual support of the frames. Though the structure of the ship is sturdy enough to hold itself together the main force it has to overcome is longitudinal bending creating a strain against its hull, its structure must be designed so that the material is disposed as much forward and aft as possible. The principal longitudinal elements are the deck, shell plating, inner bottom all of which are in the form of grillages, and additional longitudinal stretching to these. The dimensions of the ship are in order to create enough spacing between the stiffeners in prevention of buckling. Warships have used a longitudinal system of stiffening that many modern commercial vessels have adopted. This system was widely used in early merchant ships in the great eastern, it later shifted to transversely framed structure another concept in ship hull design that proved more practical. This system was later implemented on modern vessels such as tankers because of its popularity and was then named the Isherwood system. The arrangement of the Isherwood system consists of stiffening decks both side and bottom by longitudinal members, they are separated enough so they have the same distance between them ass the frames and beams. This system works by spacing out the <b>transverse</b> <b>members</b> that support the longitudinal by about 3 or 4 meters, with the wide spacing this causes the traverse strength needed by displacing the amount of force the bulkheads provide.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the elastic {{buckling}} analysis of isolated plate panels, having all edges elastically restrained against torsion and loaded by uniaxial compressive forces. Despite of the classical solutions, the energy method is applied, regarding the plating {{as part of an}} infinitely wide stiffened panel, reinforced by longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> supporting <b>members.</b> A dedicated program is developed in MATLAB, to solve the eigenvalue problem derived by the energy method, after having developed the vertical displacement field into appropriate double sine trigonometric series. The convergence of solution is investigated and a new buckling formula, as function of stiffeners’ and transverse beams’ torque rigidities ratios, is derived by curve fitting of a large amount of data. To show the feasibility of the proposed formula, different stiffened panels under uniaxial compression are analyzed and the new formula is compared with the relevant results obtained by some FE eigenvalue buckling analyses, carried out by ANSYS. In all cases the new proposed expression estimates with good accuracy the elastic buckling strength of platings under uniaxial compression with all edges elastically restrained against torsion...|$|R
