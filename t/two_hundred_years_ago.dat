The geology of Thanet consists mainly of chalk, deposited when the area was below the sea. The Isle of Thanet was formed when the English Channel was formed by the sea breaking through, an island of chalk being left {{on the east side}} of the county. It was separated from the rest of Kent by the Wantsum Channel.|$|E
5|$|The {{village is}} built beside four sandy bays; Minnis Bay to the west, Grenham Bay and Beresford Gap towards the centre and Epple Bay to the east. The village is {{situated}} on the Isle of Thanet, which was a separate island from mainland Kent until around <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> when the channel in between became silted up. The area {{to the west of}} the village, between Birchington and Herne Bay, was once part of the channel and is now low-lying marshland. In the east of the village the land rises, forming chalk cliffs and cliff stacks around the beaches at Grenham Bay, Beresford Gap and Epple Bay. A sea wall stretches along the foot of the cliffs to prevent further erosion. The geology of Thanet consists mainly of chalk, deposited when the area was below the sea. Isle of Thanet became exposed above sea-level once the English Channel broke through between Kent and France, causing the sea-level to fall. The whole of the northeast Kent coast has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E

KOGAN, is a word of Chinese origin and mainly used by urologists. Its etymologic meaning is unclear. About one to <b>two</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> many classical Japanese books of medicine used EKIGAN the Chinese character of which is quite similar to KOGAN, and which etymologically was described as "pleasure balls of man" by a contemporary anatomist in Japan, although I presume it was intended to mean "a couple of balls, side by side". In order to avoid terminologic confusion, SEISO, the standard word used in many academic fields, is recommended for universal use not only in scientific papers but in daily language in Japan...|$|R

25|$|<b>Two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> {{bighorn sheep}} were {{widespread}} throughout the western US, Canada, and northern Mexico. Some estimates placed their population at over 2 million. By around 1900, hunting, competition from ranching, and diseases had decreased {{the population to}} several thousand. A program of reintroductions, natural parks, and reduced hunting, together with a decrease in domesticated sheep {{near the end of}} World War II, allowed the bighorn sheep to make a comeback. In 2009, the California Department of Fish and Game issued 21 permits for the hunting of bighorn sheep, and 19 permits for the 2010–11 hunting season.|$|E

25|$|Since the Industrial Revolution some <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> {{the food}} {{processing}} industry has invented many technologies that both help keep foods fresh longer and alter the fresh state of food {{as they appear}} in nature. Cooling is the primary technology used to maintain freshness, whereas many more technologies have been invented to allow foods to last longer without becoming spoiled. These latter technologies include pasteurisation, autoclavation, drying, salting, and separation of various components, all of which appearing to alter the original nutritional contents of food. Pasteurisation and autoclavation (heating techniques) have no doubt improved the safety of many common foods, preventing epidemics of bacterial infection. But some of the (new) food processing technologies have downfalls as well.|$|E
25|$|The lands ravaged and {{depopulated}} by {{the civil}} war were filled up by arriving Turks who colonised the land through a mixture of conquest and trade. The result was that Byzantium's power was undermined beyond all recovery — <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> Byzantium could rely on {{the people living in}} the lands of Anatolia, Greece, Macedonia and several large islands like Cyprus and Crete. Now the population under its control was limited to the few remaining cities in Byzantine possession, namely Thessalonica and Constantinople and the surrounding countryside, and the Despotate of the Morea. The immigration of Turks would be decisive in the survival of the Empire as it gave her most dire enemy, the Ottomans, a new power base, not in Asia but now in Europe.|$|E

The caves led to an ancient abandoned city built by the enigmatic D'ni civilization. The D'ni practiced an ancient ability known as the Art. By writing a description of another world, the D'ni created [...] "linking books" [...] which served as portals to the worlds described, known as Ages.

Sachs insists on retaining complexity (geography, technological progress, etc.) in explaining differences in economic performance, rather than just simplifying to one factor (institutions).
