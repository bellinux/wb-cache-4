As a network, they involve ‘regular interaction across national boundaries when at least one actor is a non-state agent or does not operate {{on behalf of a}} national government or intergovernmental organisation’. The CCP program operates within nation-states via national and regional campaigns, as well as cross boundaries between international nations, between state and non-state actors, fitting Risse-Kappen’s <b>transnational</b> <b>governance</b> network definition. <b>Transnational</b> <b>governance</b> networks assemble information, knowledge and values objectifying ‘the integration of new conceptions of… environmental phenomena into everyday worldwide views and practices’ of public and private actors. The CCP program is identified as a public <b>transnational</b> <b>governance</b> network, as opposed to a hybrid or private transnational network, as such networks are established by and for public actors.

First, <b>transnational</b> judicial <b>governance</b> is an important form of global governance that interacts with, but is distinct from, other forms of global governance such as international institutions, transgovernmental networks, and private governance. Second, there is evidence suggesting that the influence of U.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the United Nations (UN) Guidelines on Business and Human Rights {{adopted in}} 2011 by the UN Human Rights Council {{from the perspective}} of <b>Transnational</b> Business <b>Governance</b> Interactions (TBGI) analytical framework (Eberlein et al. 2014). The article identifies and discusses dimensions of interaction and components of regulatory governance which characterise the Guiding Principles, focusing in particular on the rule formation and implementation. The article notes that the Guiding Principles actively enrolled other actors for the rule-making process ensuring support in a politically and legally volatile field. It identifies mutual ‘piggy-backing’ by the Guiding Principles and other TBGI schemes, complementing the Principles’ very limited limitation and enforcement modalities and lending support to the rule-making and implementation of other schemes. The article concludes that the UN Guiding Principles are unique in several respects of relevance to <b>transnational</b> business <b>governance</b> interaction and indicate the relevance of the TBGI approach to public regulatory <b>transnational</b> business <b>governance</b> initiatives. The analysis of the Guiding Principles as interactional <b>transnational</b> business <b>governance</b> suggests that this form of governance offers prospects for public institutions as a means towards regulating global sustainability concerns...|$|R

The CCP program is the most influential example of this celebratory work along the climate scale, as a public <b>transnational</b> <b>governance</b> network, involving public authorities in governance across both local and global scales. The CCP program as a <b>transnational</b> <b>governance</b> network exemplifies how boundaries of formal intergovernmental diplomacy are over-reached, engaging in public authoritative steering in seeking to address the mitigation of GHG emissions, at a local scale. As a <b>transnational</b> <b>governance</b> network, the CCP program network is a crucial means in improving municipal performance in respect to climate change.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{challenges to}} accountability {{in the context}} of <b>transnational</b> climate <b>governance.</b> It argues that the emergence of a distinct transnational regime complex and the increasingly integrated structure of international and <b>transnational</b> climate <b>governance</b> create new challenges for using established analytical frameworks that rely on accountability regimes for individual actor types. Instead, studying accountability requires a system-level conceptualization and a revisiting of accountability regimes, taking diversity and networked governance structures into account. Using data from the CONNECT-project on the transnational regime complex for climate change, the article uses a framework of six elements of an accountability regime to identify three overarching accountability challenges. First, the expanding borders of the transnational regime complex for climate change are starting to shift accountability from the multilateral level (the UNFCCC) to a networked and more intricate structure. Second, transparency, monitoring, and reporting remain an urgent challenge despite a rapidly increasing flow of data and repositories in particular concerning ex-post impacts. Third, the availability and utility of sanctions are poorly understood {{in the context of}} <b>transnational</b> climate <b>governance...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a first step}} towards a better theoretical and empirical knowledge of the emerging arena of <b>transnational</b> climate <b>governance.</b> The need for such a re-conceptualization emerges from the increasing relevance of non-state and transnational approaches towards climate change mitigation {{at a time when}} the intergovernmental negotiation process has to overcome substantial stalemate and the international arena becomes increasingly fragmented. Based on a brief discussion of the increasing trend towards transnationalization and functional segmentation of the global climate governance arena, we argue that a remapping of climate governance is necessary and needs to take into account different spheres of authority beyond the public and international. Hence, we provide a brief analysis of how the public/private divide has been conceptualized in Political Science and International Relations. Subsequently, we analyse the emerging <b>transnational</b> climate <b>governance</b> arena. Analytically, we distinguish between different manifestations of <b>transnational</b> climate <b>governance</b> on a continuum ranging from delegated and shared public-private authority to fully non-state and private responses to the climate problem.

50|$|Key to {{securing}} <b>transnational</b> <b>governance</b> network participation are CCP cities whom see {{the program}} {{as a means of}} promoting their interests, values and norms in regards to climate change at a local scale. In maintaining a valuable, worthwhile, and effective GHG emissions reductions governance network, member CCP cities must establish open connections within the network, creating solid network interactions. Member cities illustrating open connections toward the CCP program, through the active involvement of continual monitoring and reporting of energy use, and participation in CCP program workshops, often gain additional financial resources from the network. Alone, the production and exchange of information from CCP cities is insufficient in maintaining a transnational network. Forged on the basis financial and political resources are offered to member cities by the CCP program, based on the formation of close network links, openly connected member cities receive legitimacy of their ideas, creation of knowledge for local climate protection and shared norms, rather than the reliance upon the dissemination of technical information actively sought upon by less connected CCP cities. In maintaining a significant connection as a CCP city within a <b>transnational</b> <b>governance</b> network, members must not exclusively rely upon the dissemination of information, but rather build upon knowledge, norms and resources linked within the process of building and maintaining networks.|$|E

Research has focused on the overarching institutional architecture of global adaptation, particularly how it relates to development, political economy, efficiency and equity. In contrast to the transnational dimension of climate mitigation, the transnationalization of adaptation governance has received scant attention. By creating a dataset of adaptation projects, we examine <b>transnational</b> adaptation <b>governance</b> in terms of its scope, institutionalization and main functions. We find <b>transnational</b> adaptation <b>governance</b> to be firmly anchored within the UNFCCC, but a recent change towards adaptation governed by a transnational constituency can be identified. When non-state actors become integral to the project of governing adaptation, a 'fourth era' of adaption seems to be emerging. This new era is not replacing other forms of governing, but is emerging alongside and in a complementary fashion. In the 'fourth era', adaptation is increasingly governed globally and transnationally, and the attention is turned toward 'softer' forms of governance such as agenda setting, information sharing and capacity building.
