40|$|This is a {{study of}} {{photography}} as performance and as an ethnographic research and dissemination method. This project {{was part of a}} qualitative research methods course where doctoral students learned to collect and analyze visual data as well as what happens when they engage in a study of their own lives using photography as the main tool. Photographs, taken by the students, with short titles, constituted the only data. Analysis of the photographs without any text proved to be difficult. Written statements in addition to the <b>titles</b> <b>complementing</b> the photographs would have helped in creating the context for understanding the photographs and thereby more clearly communicating the intent of the photographers. The results indicate that an ethnography study based only on photographs would not be possible. Photography needs to be used together with other kinds of data. However, the making and presentation of the photographs allowed the students to construct and perform visually their identities as doctoral students. URN: urn:nbn:de: 0114 -fqs 080238...|$|R
50|$|Folha da Tarde began {{publishing}} on November 22, 1924, but {{it lasted}} then {{for just a}} month; {{it was a way}} to circumvent a ban instituted by the authorities against Folha da Noite. In 1949, the newspaper was relaunched as an afternoon <b>title,</b> to <b>complement</b> Folha da Manhã and Folha da Noite. On January 1, 1960, the three papers were merged to create Folha de S.Paulo.|$|R

25|$|Another rival of Tipperary is Cork in the Munster Championship. These {{teams have}} met 80 {{times in the}} championship, {{more than any other}} rivalry in hurling. They have also met them countless times in the National League and {{pre-season}} challenge tournaments. A Tipp and Cork Munster hurling final in Semple Stadium is often claimed by supporters of both counties to be the most traditional Munster final and the games between them are nearly always close. The draw and replay games of 1987 and 1991 and the 1949–1954 rivalry encapsulates this rivalry and the 1991 replayed final in Thurles is claimed {{to be one of the}} greatest Munster hurling finals. This is one of the few rivalries in the provincial championships that is contested by two teams of similar stature whose honours and <b>titles</b> <b>complement</b> each other on a fairly equal basis. Kilkenny and Wexford in hurling have major difference in titles and in football, Dublin and Meath also have a gap between their respective winnings. The football teams of Galway and Mayo enjoy a similar rivalry and whose honours are divided in equal measure.|$|R

5000|$|TCU has fielded a {{baseball}} team since 1896, before the school found its home in Fort Worth, TX.

In the Japanese release's liner notes, critic Mia Clarke described the slow ballad [...] "Off You" [...] as having a lackadaisical feel; Pitchfork Medias Will Bryant {{was struck by the}} song's creepy quality, and compared it to the mood of the Pink Floyd album The Wall. Rolling Stones Arion Berger said [...] "Off You" [...] is [...] "as direct and heartbreaking as an eighty-five-year-old blues recording, and Kim, her voice clear and full of hope, can't help sounding like a young woman who's lived ten awful lifetimes." ...|$|R
