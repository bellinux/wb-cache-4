25|$|Mk2 New rounder {{body shape}} with {{mechanicals}} {{similar to the}} SA model and the solid rear axle replaced by a <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> setup.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, {{the company}} started {{development}} of new semi-spaceframe chassis with a central backbone. This chassis used outriggers and a steel bulkhead to carry mounting points for doors. In contrast to the earlier chassis, the new design allowed for the seats to be mounted low (six inches from the ground) {{on either side of}} the backbone tunnel. The <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> suspension from the Volkswagen Beetle was used for both the front and rear suspension, setting the precedent of all-independent suspension for TVRs in the future.|$|E
25|$|For the Japanese {{domestic}} market, the 610 was {{pitted against}} {{the second generation}} Toyota Corona Mark II. Also in Japan, the 610 was initially sold alongside the 510 but eventually replaced the 510. 610's were available as a four-door, two-door hardtop (HT), and a five-door wagon/light van. Trim levels in Japan were GL (Grand Luxe), SSS (Super Sports Sedan), DX (Deluxe) or STD (Standard). It borrowed its suspension and drive train from the outgoing 510, with some modifications. Likewise, the 610 four-door and two-door retained the class-leading, independent rear <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> design, while the wagon reused the rear live axle with leaf springs from the 510 wagon.|$|E
5000|$|Front suspension: Independent with <b>trailing</b> <b>arms,</b> {{leaf springs}} and {{friction}} shocks.|$|R
5000|$|Suspension:Swingarms rear w/torsion bars, <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> {{front with}} hairpin springs, oil filled metal dampers ...|$|R
5000|$|Rear: <b>Trail</b> <b>arm</b> {{heavy-duty}} 343mm / 13.5" [...] {{travel with}} dual coil over springs, gas/hydraulic shocks ...|$|R
2500|$|The car used unit body construction, had a {{wheelbase}} of [...] and a {{dry weight}} of 1,400kg. The all-independent suspension {{was of the}} double wishbone type with coil springs upfront, and <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> type with transverse torsion bars at the rear.|$|E
2500|$|The {{undercarriage}} was retractable, {{with a pair}} {{of small}} wheels {{on the end of a}} <b>trailing</b> <b>arm,</b> each fitted with a vertical shock absorber; the arm was slightly kinked to tuck the wheels almost entirely within the fuselage when retracted and also to act as a protective skid on rough ground. [...] There was a small tail bumper.|$|E
2500|$|The 8C 2900 was {{designed}} to compete in sports car races {{in general and the}} Mille Miglia in particular. [...] It used the 2.9L version of the 8C engine and was based on the 8C 35 Grand Prix racing chassis. As such, it had an inline 8-cylinder 2.9-litre engine using two Roots type superchargers fed by two updraught Weber carburettors and fully independent suspension with Dubonnet-type <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> suspension with coil springs and hydraulic dampers at front and swing axles with a transverse leaf spring at the rear.|$|E
50|$|The Quattroporte was a four-door, five-seater saloon with a steel unibody construction. The {{overall layout}} {{remained}} unchanged from the Biturbos {{from which the}} car descended: longitudinal front engine, rear-wheel drive, all-independent suspension with MacPherson struts upfront and <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> at the rear. Despite these similarities the suspension had been re-engineered: rear <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> had a tube framework structure like on the Shamal, and together with the limited slip differential were attached to the body via a newly designed tubular subframe.|$|R
50|$|The twist-beam rear {{suspension}} (also torsion-beam axle or deformable torsion beam) {{is a type}} of automobile suspension based on a large H or C shaped member. The front of the H attaches to the body via rubber bushings, and the rear of the H carries each stub-axle assembly, {{on each side of the}} car. The cross beam of the H holds the two <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> together, and provides the roll stiffness of the suspension, by twisting as the two <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> move vertically, relative to each other.|$|R
50|$|The {{geometry}} and high (relative to total) unsprung weight gave it some bump steer, which owners sometimes treated {{by moving the}} supports forward and lengthening the <b>trailing</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Under the bonnet, the car {{utilised}} the new Villiers Mk 35A unit {{designed specifically}} for it. A development of the 9E, the new engine incorporated numerous mechanical refinements to improve strength and reliability, albeit slightly {{at the cost of}} overall power, now rated at [...] at 4,500rpm. Rear suspension was completely revised, with <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> units controlled by Armstrong dampers. The rod and cable brake systems of previous cars was also replaced by a Lockheed semi hydraulic and rod braking system (front brake fully hydraulic, but rear brakes still rod operated from a central floor-mounted hydraulic cylinder) acting on all three wheels.|$|E
2500|$|The {{undercarriage}} was {{a variant}} of the well-proved pattern used on the Blériot XI, with the wheels mounted on a <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> free to slide up and down and sprung [...] by bungee cords. [...] Unlike that of the Blériot XI, the main vertical members terminated in a crossbar below the fuselage rather than one attached to the upper longerons, and it was also braced by a pair of diagonal struts either side, the front pair leading {{to the front of the}} upper longerons and forming the front of the raked engine cowling. The tailskid was made of two U-shaped pieces of rattan cane.|$|E
2500|$|The Ridgeline has a four-wheel {{independent}} suspension with MacPherson struts {{in front and}} a multi-link <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> rear with upright springs and dampers. [...] It has a turning diameter of [...] using variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering. [...] It has four-wheel disc brakes with [...] ventilated front discs with floating twin piston calipers. [...] The rear brakes use [...] solid rear discs with floating single piston calipers and integrated emergency/parking brakes using a [...] "drum-in-hat" [...] design. [...] The disc brakes are controlled via a four-channel Anti-lock Braking System with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution and Brake Assist. [...] Although [...] to 0 stopping distances of [...] to [...] have been reported, the average appears to be between [...] and [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} track is slightly wider on the V8S achieved with revised wishbones {{at the front}} and revised <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> at the rear. Disc brakes are fitted all round.|$|R
50|$|The Audi 80 had a MacPherson strut front suspension, and a C-section beam {{rear axle}} located by <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> and a Panhard rod, and using coil springs and {{telescopic}} dampers.|$|R
50|$|The HB used a {{completely}} different suspension design from the HA, having double-wishbone and coil springs with integrated telescopic dampers at the front, and <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> and coil springs at the rear. Lateral location and anti-squat of the rear axle was achieved using upper <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> mounted at approximately 45° fixed to lugs {{at the top of}} the differential. Both front and rear could also be fitted with optional anti-roll bars. The HB set new standards for handling in its class as a result of the adoption of this suspension design, where many of its contemporaries stuck with leaf springs and MacPherson struts.|$|R
2500|$|With the 1988 {{model year}} came a {{completely}} new front and rear suspension with vented disc brakes at all four corners- what Pontiac's engineers had planned for the car to have from the beginning. The front suspension geometry was changed to decrease the scrub radius thus decreasing steering effort without adding a bulky power steering system. The camber curve was also much improved, the dampers are moved inside the coil springs, and new sealed bearing/hub units were used in 1988. The rear suspension featured multi-link (two lateral links and one <b>trailing</b> <b>arm)</b> Chapman strut suspension, and the tie-rod related bump steer experienced with the earlier suspension design was fixed. The brakes were also upgraded to [...] vented rotors {{on the front and}} rear with an improved slide caliper design having larger diameter slides. The Fiero Formula (new for 1988) and Fiero GT models also received a rear anti-sway bar to compliment non-progressive rate springs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{suspension}} also automatically accommodates differing payloads in the car- {{with four}} people and cargo {{on board the}} wheelbase increases by around 4cm (2in) as the suspension deflects, and the castor angle of the front wheels increases {{by as much as}} 8 degrees thus ensuring that ride quality, handling and road holding are almost unaffected by the additional weight. On early cars friction dampers (like a dry version of a multi-plate clutch design) were fitted at the mountings of the front and rear swinging arms to the cross-tubes. Because the rear brakes were outboard, they had extra tuned mass dampers to damp wheel bounce from the extra unsprung mass. Later models had tuned mass dampers ("batteurs") at the front (because the leading arm had more inertia and [...] "bump/thump" [...] than the <b>trailing</b> <b>arm),</b> with hydraulic telescopic dampers / shock absorbers front and rear. The uprated hydraulic damping obviated the need for the rear inertia dampers. It was designed to be a comfortable ride by matching the frequencies encountered in human bipedal motion.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 May 2012, General Atomics {{conducted}} the successful first flight of its upgraded MQ-9 Block 1-plus Reaper. The Block 1–plus version {{was designed for}} increased electrical power, secure communications, automatic landing, increased gross takeoff weight (GTOW), weapons growth, and streamlined payload integration capabilities. A new high-capacity starter generator offers increased electrical power capacity to provide growth capacity; a backup generator is also present and is sufficient for all flight-critical functions, improving the electrical power system's reliability via three independent power sources. New communications capabilities, including dual ARC-210 VHF/UHF radios with wingtip antennas, allow for simultaneous communications between multiple air-to-air and air-to-ground parties, secure data links, and an increased data transmission capacity. The new <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> main landing gear allows the carriage of heavier payloads or additional fuel. Development and testing were completed, and Milestone C was achieved in September 2012. [...] Follow-on aircraft will be redesignated MQ-9 Block 5. On 15 October 2013, the USAF awarded General Atomics a $377.4 million contract for 24 MQ-9 Block 5 Reapers. The MQ-9 Block 5 flew its first combat mission on 23 June 2017.|$|E
5000|$|The Type Two {{platform}} was a {{front wheel}} drive platform designed by the Italian Fiat Group and used during the late 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s {{for a range of}} Alfa Romeo, Fiat and Lancia models. It introduced the concept of a [...] "modular" [...] platform, albeit not as modular as current platforms are, allowing the group to assemble various models, also with some special modifications, from the same floorpan.It uses four-wheel independent suspension, composed of MacPherson struts at the front and <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> at the rear, with Alfa Romeo Spider and GTV using a multilink setup rather than <b>trailing</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} initially had outboard {{springs and}} shock absorbers, but with later versions, this was moved inboard with a rocker arm upper suspension arm. There were {{two types of}} rear suspension offered: one with a live axle, located by <b>trailing</b> <b>arms,</b> leading arms and a panhard rod. The other had independent rear suspension.|$|R
50|$|The {{platform}} chassis and suspension {{is similar}} to the 2CV, being independent all round using leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> and coil springs interconnected front to rear. For a detailed suspension description see Citroën 2CV.|$|R
2500|$|In 1935, {{to compete}} with Mercedes Benz and Auto Union, Enzo Ferrari (Race team manager) and Luigi Bazzi (Designer) built a racer with two 3.2 (3.165-litre) engines, one {{in the front and}} one in the rear, giving 6.3litres and [...] The {{drivetrain}} layout was unusual. The two engines were connected by separate driveshaft to a gearbox with two input shafts, and two angled output shafts, so each of the rear wheels had its own driveshaft. It could never quite succeed against the Mercedes W25 B of Rudolf Caracciola, and was hard on fuel and tyres. The gain in speed was offset by increased pit times. On May 12, 1935, two were entered in the Tripoli Grand Prix driven by Nuvolari and Chiron who finished fourth and fifth. Chiron managed a second at the following 1935 Avus race. On June 16, 1935 Nuvolari drove a specially prepared Bimotore from Florence to Livorno and set a new speed record [...] with an average speed of over [...] After that it was sidelined in favour of the Tipo C. It was the first racer to use the Dubonnet independent <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> front suspension. The V12 was under development, but was not race ready. It was noticed that the Bimotore had a traction advantage on rough ground, so a version of the Bimotore chassis with the independent Dubonnet front end, and a new independent rear with swing axles with radius rods and a transverse leaf spring was used for the Tipo C 3.8s.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2012, General Atomics {{released}} a new <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> {{design for the}} Reaper's main landing gear; benefits include an over 30 percent increase in landing weight capacity, a 12 percent increase in gross takeoff weight (from [...] to [...] ), a maintenance-free shock absorber (eliminating the need for nitrogen pressurization), a fully rejected takeoff brake system, and provisions for automatic takeoff and landing capability and Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) field upgrades. In April 2012, General Atomics announced possible upgrades to USAF Reapers, including two extra [...] fuel pods under the wings to increase endurance to 37 hours. The wingspan can also be increased to , increasing endurance to 42 hours. The USAF has bought 38 Reaper Extended Range (ER) versions, carrying external fuel tanks (which don't affect weapon capacity), the heavy-weight landing gear, a four-bladed propeller, a new fuel management system which ensures fuel and thermal balance among external tank, wing, and fuselage fuel sources, and an alcohol water injection (AWI) system to shorten required runway takeoff length; these features increase endurance from 27 to 33–35 hours, while the company is still pitching the lengthened wing option. The Reaper ER first flew operationally in August 2015. The aircraft also has the sensor ball replaced with a high-definition camera, better communications so ground controllers can see the higher quality video, software to enable automatic detection of threats and tracking of 12 moving targets at once, {{and the ability to}} [...] "super ripple" [...] fire missiles within 0.32 seconds of each other.|$|E
5000|$|... 20.3.3.2.1: Truck <b>Trailing</b> <b>Arm</b> Crossmember Assembly:Truck <b>Trailing</b> <b>Arm</b> Mounting Brackets ...|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} system uses Land Rover Discovery beam axles front and rear. The front axles are located by radius rods and a Panhard rod. The rear axle is located by <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> and Watt's linkage.|$|R
2500|$|Engine and {{transmission}} selections are {{identical to those}} used in the Hatch/Hardtop model, except the [...] One Diesel; and the rear suspension set-up shares {{many of the same}} designs features including the rear <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> and the anti-roll bars.|$|R
5000|$|The {{front was}} by [...] "A" [...] arms and coil springs with an {{anti-roll}} bar {{serving as the}} front half of the top A arm. The rear had <b>trailing</b> <b>arms,</b> a triangular centre locating member and solid rear axle.|$|R
50|$|F. The {{horizontal}} centerline of {{the highest}} truck <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> mounting bolt must not be higher than the top surface of the truck <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> crossmember, at the respective truck <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> mounting bracket, when the vehicle is at inspection orientation.|$|E

5000|$|Suspension: Independent front <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> {{and live}} axle rear {{suspension}} ...|$|E
50|$|Front {{suspension}} used <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> {{and independent}} springs in combination, {{while at the}} back a rigid “swing” axle was supported by leaf springs. Both at the front and at the back the suspension was enhanced with “rubber air-filled hollow springs”.|$|R
50|$|The Visa {{featured}} a soft but well-damped, long-travel, fully independent suspension (Coil-sprung MacPherson struts at the front, with coil sprung <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> at the rear) {{that contributed to}} a soft ride similar to the Citroën 2CV, but without extreme bodyroll.|$|R
50|$|In {{place of}} the usual rear solid axle, there is {{independent}} suspension from lower wishbones, the original <b>trailing</b> <b>arms,</b> an upper strut and an anti-roll bar. At the front a radius rod on each side {{was added to the}} standard double wishbones.|$|R
