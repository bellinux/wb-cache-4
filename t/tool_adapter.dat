40|$|Tool Integration is a {{vital part}} in the modern IT industry. With the ever {{increasing}} complexity in reality, more tools in different domains are needed {{in research and development}} process. However, currently no vendor has a complete solution for the whole process, and no mature solution to integrate different tools together, thus tools are still used separately in the industry. Due to this separation, the same information is created more than once for different tools, which is both time wasting and error prone. This thesis is part of the research to deliver a model-based tool integration framework that helps the end user design their own scenario of tool integration and implement it with less effort by generating most common parts automatically. This thesis itself is mainly focused on tool adapters, including the model-based <b>tool</b> <b>adapter</b> construction and discovery. In the first part, a model-based <b>tool</b> <b>adapter</b> construction platform conforming to OSLC is designed and implemented, based on which, the construction process of a <b>tool</b> <b>adapter</b> is presented with an example. With this platform, most of the codes and configuration files can be generated, with the exemption of the tool specific functionalities. The <b>tool</b> <b>adapter</b> is constructed as a separate SCA component, and can be included in the SCA based tool chain with minor configuration. With SCA, the deployment of the <b>tool</b> <b>adapter</b> and future management can be largely eased. In the second part, the model-based discovery process of an unknown <b>tool</b> <b>adapter</b> conforming to OSLC and our assumptions is presented in detail. With the discovery tool, the sharing of the <b>tool</b> <b>adapter</b> is made possible, and the integration of the different tools are largely eased. An example of discover an unknown <b>tool</b> <b>adapter</b> is also included for a more clear explanation. Finally, in the meanwhile of the design and implementation of the construction platform and the discovery process, the existing Matlab/Simulink <b>tool</b> <b>adapter</b> is extended and refined to make it full compatible to the standard and our tool chain...|$|E

40|$|The All-Terrain Hex-Legged Extra-Terrestrial Explorer (ATHLETE) is a six-limbed robot {{designed}} to support surface explorations on Near Earth Objects, the Moon and Mars.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{handheld}} adapter equipped with a tri-axial accelerometer is the most convenient and efficient approach for measuring vibration exposure at the hand-tool interface, especially when the adapter is incorporated into a miniature handheld or wrist-strapped dosimeter. To help optimize the adapter approach, the specific aims {{of this study are}} to identify and understand the major sources and mechanisms of measurement errors and uncertainties associated with using these adapters, and to explore their improvements. Five representative adapter models were selected and used in the experiment. Five human subjects served as operators in the experiment on a hand-arm vibration test system. The results of this study confirm that many of the handheld adapters can produce substantial overestimations of vibration exposure, and measurement errors can significantly vary with <b>tool,</b> <b>adapter</b> model, mounting position, mounting orientation, and subject. Major problems with this approach include unavoidable influence of the hand dynamic motion on the adapter, unstable attachment, insufficient attachment contact force, and inappropriate adapter structure. However, {{the results of this study}} also suggest that measurement errors can be substantially reduced if the design and use of an adapter can be systematically optimized toward minimizing the combined effects of the identified factors. Some potential methods for improving the design and use of the adapters are also proposed and discussed.

40|$|Engineers are {{tasked with}} {{designing}} new systems {{every day to}} meet changing or unexpected technical requirements. After the tragic explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger on January 28, 1986, NASA engineers embarked on a complete overhaul of many of their long-standing quality systems and procedures. When the official cause of the accident {{was determined to be}} an O-ring failure in the right Solid Rocket Booster, NASA's Shuttle Program initiated a thorough redesign of the rocket boosters' clevis ends, which are the O-ring's mating surfaces. One of the unique systems that NASA engineers developed {{as a result of this}} effort included a heating assembly that is coupled to the outside of the rocket boosters. When the assembly is affixed to the external surface of the boosters, the very nature of its design allows for the warming of the O-rings prior to launch. After the engineers completed the assembly's design, however, they found that it was nearly impossible to tighten the spanner nuts required for attaching the system, given the minimum amount of clearance they had in the limited and confined space. Under these circumstances, the standard wrenches typically used for tightening these types of nuts did not work, and there were no other existing devices to solve the problem. NASA engineers embraced the challenge, developing a torque wrench <b>tool</b> <b>adapter</b> that allowed for a full rotation of spanner nuts in confined spaces.

40|$|In the thesis, a {{prototype}} object-oriented fuzzy expert system called SAM (Smart Assistant to Machinist) is presented for rotating cutter selection and cutting condition design. Object-Oriented Design and Programming Methods are employed {{to construct and}} implement the system. Based on partial and imprecise information, the system is able to select rotating cutter products available in current commercial market, and design cutting conditions for an optimized objective. The system consists of four modules: a database, a rule base, a cutter selection module and a cutting condition design module. The database consists of six kinds of data files: machinability of workpieces, machining plan, fuzzy rule, <b>tool</b> <b>adapter,</b> machine tool, as well as cutter inventory files. The rules in the rule base are developed based on fuzzy set theory. They are used to cross-define unknown information and to determine {{the relationships between the}} inputs and outputs information. The cutter selection module is developed based on fuzzy logic, in which the cutter selection is conducted in three steps. First, the input information is 2 ̆ 2 fuzzied 2 ̆ 2. Next, using the fuzzy correlation functions, insert grades and cutters are selected. Then, the selected grades and cutters are searched against the cutter inventory data file to check the availability. The cutting condition design module is developed based on fuzzy non-linear programming where the design constraints could be fuzzy. The model is solved by Hill Climbing Algorithm. Finally, the use of system is demonstrated using two examples. Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering.

40|$|Abstract. During {{the overall}} {{development}} of complex engineering sys-tems different modeling notations are employed. For example, {{in the domain}} of automotive systems system engineering models are employed quite early to capture the requirements and basic structuring of the entire system, while software engineering models are used later on to describe the concrete software architecture. Each model helps in addressing the specific design issue with appropriate notations and at a suitable level of abstraction. However, when we step forward from system design to the software design, the engineers have to ensure that all decisions cap-tured in the system design model are correctly transferred to the soft-ware engineering model. Even worse, when changes occur later on in either model, today the consistency has to be reestablished in a cumber-some manual step. In this paper, we present how model synchronization and consistency rules can be applied to automate this task and ensure that the different models are kept consistent. We also introduce a gen-eral approach for model synchronization. Besides synchronization, the approach consists of <b>tool</b> <b>adapters</b> as well as consistency rules covering the overlap between the synchronized parts of a model and the rest. We present the model synchronization algorithm based on triple graph gram-mars in detail and further exemplify the general approach by means of a model synchronization solution between system engineering models in SysML and software engineering models in AUTOSAR which has been developed for an industrial partner. ...|$|R

This thesis investigated increasing the capability of creating genetic circuits through cost reduction and automation using Golden Gate assembly as a model assembly method. Nearly 20 -fold reduction in cost was achieved by lowering the total reaction volume {{as well as the}} amount of enzymes used, the major cost factor. Lowering the DNA assembly reaction volume was achieved using pin tools capable of transferring nanoliter scale volumes. Automation was achieved by creating an on-the-fly swappable pin <b>tool</b> <b>adapter</b> for use with the Tecan Freedom EVO liquid handling robot. Software was developed as part of the BioCAD framework to enable easy programmed use of pin tools. Proof-of-concept experiments with pre-mixed DNA inputs reliably achieved 100 % correctness at the colony screening level. A seven-way reaction, assembled from individual DNA sources in a total volume of 2 [mu]L using 0. 5 units of BsaI and 1 Weiss units of T 4 DNA ligase (20 times less than used by researchers manually) showed an efficiency of 10 %, with approximately 100 correct colonies formed at the colony screening level, more than necessary for down-stream processing. These proof-of-concept results suggest that using pin tools and automation is a viable approach to reduce the costs of reactions run daily by many synthetic biologists. by Kristjan Eerik Kaseniit.

40|$|Kongsberg Automotive {{produces}} injection molded parts. These {{are removed}} from the mold with a robot gripper. These robot grippers have grown larger as {{the complexity of the}} molds grew. This has increased the amount of collisions between the mold and the gripper. Kongsberg Automotive wants to find out if it is a possibility to use additive manufacturing to produce smaller and better grippers for their production lines. During this thesis work a new design concept for robot grippers was developed. The purpose of this design is to reduce the production halts resulting from contact between the gripper assembly and its surrounding machinery, and to decrease the wear due to high moments of inertia imposing high loads on the assembly substructures. The design of the structural subunits is utilizing topology optimization. (Optistruct and Inspire by Altair) This thesis is written in collaboration with Kongsberg Automotive, Raufoss. It has also developed and manufactured a prototype gripper that fits the injection molding tool and machinery used in production at Kongsberg Automotive, Raufoss. The gripper subassembly was manufactured using additive manufacturing of metal, utilizing powder bed fusion. The prototype is made from the aluminum alloy powder CL 30 AL, delivered by Concept Laser Co. specifically for use in additive manufacturing. The design for the prototype was narrower than the currently used design, while fulfilling the demands to strength and stiffness. This gives the gripper sufficient room on all sides when it is inside the mold. It also has the quick change <b>tool</b> <b>adapter</b> build into the body of the part.

40|$|Hand-arm {{vibration}} syndrome (HAVS) {{is a disease}} commonly experienced by workers exposed to vibrating hand-held <b>tools.</b> A hand-held <b>adapter</b> approach to quantify vibration exposures at the palm of the hand is the most prevalent method recommended in the International Standards: ISO 10819 and ISO 5349. Due to {{the differences in the}} biodynamic responses of the palm and fingers, it is important to differentiate between palmar and finger exposure measurements, where the occurrence of HAVS may be more dominant. Grip and feed forces are influential factors of vibration exposure and the ability to reliably measure these forces may provide helpful insight on hand-tool coupling and exposure-response relationships, which are both crucial in designing effective prevention methods. Two biomechanical sensor systems, for laboratory- and field-based measurements, were developed in order to measure vibration exposures and grip forces at the palm and fingers during the exposure monitoring. The laboratory-based adapter system expands upon the adapter system in ISO 10819 by adding a finger adapter that allows for the evaluation of a glove attenuation effectiveness at the finger and, thus, assesses the overall vibration-reducing effectiveness of a glove more objectively. The field-based system expands upon the adapter system recommended in ISO 5349 with addition of a finger adapter that allows for differentiating between palmar and finger vibration exposures and reliably measuring palm and finger forces via force sensitive resistors (FSR). Both systems were manufactured using fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3 D printing using polylactic acid (PLA) material and were thoroughly tested for vibration transmissibility to show that FDM 3 D printing is a viable <b>tool</b> for manufacturing <b>adapters</b> for vibration exposure measurements. Palm and finger force measurements were verified using a cylindrical dynamometric handle and a force plate and showed that the field-adapter system is able to quantify grip force measurements with decent precision, especially in static dynamometric gripping.

Overall, both systems were able to accurately measure simulated tool vibration spectra and confirmed their viability in vibration exposure assessment...|$|R

Architectural studies have indicated that one useful role for ATHLETE in planetary (moon or Mars) exploration is to "walk" cargo off the payload deck of a lander and transport it across the surface. Recent architectural approaches are focused on the concept that the lander descent stage will use liquid hydrogen as a propellant. This is the highest performance chemical fuel, but it requires very large tanks. A natural geometry for the lander is to have a single throttleable rocket engine on the centerline at the bottom, and to have the propellant tanks arranged as compactly as possible around and above that engine, with nearly-straight structural load paths that carry the heavy LO 2 tanks as well as the ascent stage or cargo on a top deck. (The requirement for exactly one descent engine stems from the need to avoid symmetry planes in the exhaust plume that can entrain surface particles and loft them up into the system at hypervelocity.) This geometry is especially attractive since abort considerations drive the ascent stage to have as much open space around it as possible, in case the ascent stage needs to fire away from an out-of-control descent stage. These considerations lead to a configuration where the cargo deck of the lander is relatively high off the ground (over 6 meters in current concepts, using a 10 -meter diameter launch shroud). These considerations have led some observers to presume that there is a "lander offloading problem". ATHLETE has been demonstrated as a solution to this problem, walking cargo off the high deck. This paper describes the applicability of the ATHLETE concept to exploration of the moon, Mars and even to Near- Earth Objects. Recent field test results for long-range traverse are described, along with plans for testing in the simulated microgravity environment of a NEO...|$|R

And now, many chat applications emerging from a web, desktop or mobile. There are many protocols {{that are used to}} building chatt applications such as IRC, MTProto, YMSG and the latest is WebSocket. WebSocket is a protocol that provides full-duplex communication channel by a single TCP, WebSocket designed for applied in a web browser, a web server and a client server application. WebSocket also support for android and IOS mobile. WebSocket very suitable for a group chat application, because the features and advantages that match wiith the characteristics of the chat, such as real-time, two-way communication that allows the server push the data from client to client, and its traffic is not too heavy. Group chat using WebSocket application in android created using Eclipse that installed Tomcat 7, Eclipse Java EE Developer <b>Tools,</b> JST Server <b>Adapters,</b> and JST Server Adapters Extensions, the Android SDK.

40|$|Conventional {{tools are}} {{incapable}} of preparing the curved articular surface geometry required during cartilage repair procedures. A novel curved surface preparation technique was proposed and tested to provide an accurate low-cost solution. Three shapes of samples, with flat, 30  mm radius and 60  mm radius surfaces, were manufactured from foam bone substitute for testing. Registering guides and cutting guides were designed and 3 -D printed to fit onto the foam samples. A rotational cutting <b>tool</b> with an <b>adapter</b> was used to prepare the surfaces following the guidance slots in the cutting guides. The accuracies of the positions and shapes of the prepared cavities were measured using a digital calliper, and the surface depth accuracy was measured using a 3 -D scanner. The mean shape and position errors were both approximately ±  0. 5  mm and the mean surface depth error ranged from 0 to 0. 3  mm, range −  0. 3 to +  0. 45  mm 95 % CI. This study showed that the technique was able to prepare a curved surface accurately; with some modification {{it can be used}} to prepare the knee surface for cartilage repair...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of highly integrated, safety-relevant automotive functions {{is faced with}} the challenge of increasing complexity resulting from product customization and variants in implementation through software-hardware solutions. In order to reduce development time in this scenario, systematic reuse of engineering artifacts is important. This paper introduces a systematic model-based engineering approach that combines architecture design, requirements engineering, and safety analyses with variant management and provides evaluation results to address these challenges. In detail, this tool-supported approach achieves a new level of seamless safety engineering across variants by enabling typical safety lifecycle artifacts to be represented in a homogeneous, UML-compliant model notation. Safety-related information is no longer scattered in various isolated tools and formats, but instead consolidated and integrated. A further and decisive benefit of this notation is that variability can now be expressed and managed easily by regular variant management <b>tools</b> with UML <b>adapters.</b> Together with changeimpact analysis, which is facilitated equally the ultimate goal of developing and maintaining modular safety cases can be achieved. Examples on how to use this model-based safety engineering method for variant-rich automotive functions are presented for a hazard analysis, a fault tree analysis and for a safety concept specification...|$|R
