5000|$|The Royal Star had a {{relatively}} small 1" [...] single Amal monobloc carburettor, and later Concentric carburettor, but in 1964 new 8.5:1 pistons and a new gearbox improved performance. The machine had {{a top speed of}} about 90 mph and was relatively free of vibration. Sharing common engine and cycle parts with the larger BSA A65 Star 650 twin, it was an over-engineered machine and proved very robust. The only major fault with the engine design was a plain crankshaft bearing on the <b>timing</b> <b>side</b> which, when worn, would cause a drop in oil pressure. In 1965, BSA addressed the bearing issues with a roller bearing on the <b>drive</b> <b>side,</b> as it had been on the pre-unit engines, with an improved bronze bushing on the <b>timing</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R

It allows us {{for the first time to}} tackle these two architectures with a polynomial attack complexity. In greater detail, our power and <b>timing</b> <b>side</b> channels provide information on the single outputs of the many parallel Arbiter PUFs inside an XOR Arbiter PUF or Lightweight PUF. They indicate how many of these single outputs (in sum) were equal to one (and how many were equal to zero) before the outputs entered the final XOR gate. Taken for itself, this side channel information is of little value, since it does not tell which of th...|$|R

40|$|When {{multiple}} job {{processes are}} served by a single scheduler, the queueing delays of one process are often affected by the others, resulting in a <b>timing</b> <b>side</b> channel that leaks the arrival pattern of one process to the others. In this work, we study such a <b>timing</b> <b>side</b> channel between a regular user and a malicious attacker. Utilizing Shannon’s mutual information {{as a measure of}} information leakage between the user and attacker, we analyze privacy-preserving behaviors of common work-conserving schedulers. We find that the attacker can always learn perfectly the user’s arrival process in a longest-queue-first (LQF) scheduler. When the user’s job arrival rate is very low (near zero), first-come-first-serve (FCFS) and round robin schedulers both completely reveal the user’s arrival pattern. The near-complete information leakage in the low-rate traffic region is proven to be reduced by half in a work-conserving version of TDMA (WC-TDMA) scheduler, which turns out to be privacy-optimal in the class of deterministic-working-conserving (det-WC) schedulers, according to a universal lower bound on information leakage we derive for all det-WC schedulers.

50|$|Dead pedals {{have never}} been a {{required}} addition to standard automobile pedal sets. This is because the advantages of having a dead pedal are most commonly associated with manual transmission cars. Furthermore, cars with left <b>side</b> <b>drive</b> often have a natural footrest because of the wheel well so it is more common to find right <b>side</b> <b>drive</b> cars with dead pedals. However, the dead pedal promotes safe driving habits by serving as a place for drivers to place their foot and prevent accidental left foot braking. It is not recommended to brake with the left foot because it is less confusing when switching between automatic and manual transmission cars. Resting one's foot on the brake pedal may also accidentally light up the brake lights when the vehicle is not decelerating.|$|R

40|$|Infrastructure and {{especially}} mass transit {{play a major}} role in urban economics and are the centre of many research questions. Probably due to simultaneous determination of infrastructure supply and demand most research is only carried out on the supply <b>side</b> <b>driven</b> relationship explaining how transport leads to urban development. The intention of the paper is to provide a new and purely empirical perspective on the chicken-and-egg-problem. We propose a panel VAR approach employing a unique data set for historic Berlin between 1870 and 1936. We argue that it is of a planner?s interest to not only incorporate the supply <b>side</b> <b>driven</b> relationship but also the demand sided one. We turn the simultaneity problem into a purely empirical question since in practice it becomes difficult to derive theoretical implications from a comprehensive model that fully reflects all mutual interactions. Our analysis follows a twofold approach: Firstly, we estimate the interaction between population and transport. We then secondly extend the analysis by looking into the relation between land values and transport. Our estimates suggest a supply <b>side</b> <b>driven</b> relationship between transport and population and a positive reciprocal one between transport and land values. We conclude that new lines are not built entirely into undeveloped land but need to be connected to areas characterised by high land values to serve as a commuting mode...|$|R
