50|$|Regional Express Rail is {{a project}} to improve GO Transit train service by adding all-day, two-way service to <b>the</b> Barrie <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> inner {{portions}} of <b>the</b> Kitchener <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Stouffville <b>line,</b> <b>and</b> by increasing frequency of train service on various lines to as often as every 15 minutes on five of the corridors. This would be achieved with the full electrification of <b>the</b> Lakeshore East <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Barrie <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> electrification of the inner portions of <b>the</b> Lakeshore West <b>line,</b> <b>the</b> Kitchener <b>line,</b> <b>the</b> Barrie <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Stouffville <b>line.</b>|$|R

5|$|For {{the general}} {{case of a}} line {{terminated}} in some arbitrary impedance it is usual to describe the signal as a wave traveling down <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> analyse it in the frequency domain.

5|$|In late April 1800, Confiance cruised off Sunda Strait, {{where she}} {{captured}} an American ship; she {{then left the}} strait to avoid the frigate , which was known to cruise in these waters, and sailed to the Seychelles. There, he escaped a British ship of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> a frigate, and sailed on to cruise the Bay of Bengal.|$|E
5|$|Metrorail {{currently}} operates 23 stations, {{and combined}} with the Metromover in Downtown Miami and Brickell, the entire Metro system operates 43 stations.

5|$|On 1 August 1798 a British {{fleet of}} 13 ships of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> one fourth rate ship under Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson {{discovered}} a French fleet of 13 ships of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> four frigates at anchor in Aboukir Bay on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. Nelson {{had been in}} pursuit of the French for three months, crossing the Mediterranean three times in his efforts to locate the fleet and a convoy under its protection which carried the French army commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte intended for the invasion of Egypt. The convoy successfully eluded Nelson and the army landed at Alexandria on 31 June, capturing the city and advancing inland. The fleet was too large to anchor in Alexandria harbour and instead Bonaparte ordered its commander, Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers to take up station in Aboukir Bay.|$|E
5|$|On 16 January 1958, a {{passenger}} train {{collided with a}} light engine which was standing foul of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> was derailed. The light engine ended up on its side.

5|$|The {{positions}} {{specific to}} punt plays are the punter (P), long snapper, and gunner. The long snapper snaps the football {{directly to the}} punter, who then drops and kicks it before it hits the ground.

5|$|A four-track Second Avenue Subway would {{originate}} from {{a connection to}} the IRT Pelham Line at 138th Street, the Bronx, to Grand Street, Manhattan. The connection to the Pelham Line would allow for eight additional trains per hour operating between Manhattan and the Pelham Line. It would then be possible to operate 10-car trains via <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> it would also be possible to operate full express service via the line's center express track. The trains operating via Nassau Street would go to Brooklyn via the Montague Tunnel. During non-rush hours trains would terminate at Broad Street. There would be a passageway built from Grand Central via 43rd Street to Second Avenue to permit transfers.|$|E
