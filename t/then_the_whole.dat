5|$|Bottom time is {{the time}} spent at depth before {{starting}} the ascent. Bottom time used for decompression planning may be defined differently depending on the tables or algorithm used. It may include descent time, but not in all cases. It is important to check how bottom time is defined for the tables before they are used. For example, tables using Bühlmann's algorithm define bottom time as the elapsed time between leaving the surface {{and the start of}} the final ascent at 10 metres per minute, and if the ascent rate is slower, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of the ascent time needs to be considered part of the bottom time for the algorithm to remain safe.|$|E

25|$|The order {{complex of}} a {{partially}} ordered set consists of the chains (totally ordered subsets) of the partial order.

It may be interpreted as the clique complex of the comparability graph of the partial order.|$|E
25|$|Understandably, high combat {{fatigue and}} low morale meant the Stab, I. and III. Gruppen of JG 27 were {{withdrawn}} to Sicily in October, to operate over Malta.

25|$|At 12.50, {{just after}} I {{had emerged from}} a state of jubilation at finding the first {{definite}} fossils on Everest, {{there was a sudden}} clearing of the atmosphere, and the entire summit ridge and final peak of Everest were unveiled. My eyes became fixed on one tiny black spot silhouetted on a small snow-crest beneath a rock-step in the ridge; the black spot moved. Another black spot became apparent and moved up the snow to join the other on the crest. The first then approached the great rock-step and shortly emerged at the top; the second did likewise. <b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> fascinating vision vanished, enveloped in cloud once more.|$|E

50|$|The method {{begins with}} one part, {{such as the}} last (distal) {{phalange}} of the little finger, treated as {{one side of a}} square. Rotating that square's diagonal gives a 1 : √2 rectangle, suitable for the next (medial) phalange. The method is repeated to get <b>the</b> next phalange, <b>then</b> (using <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> finger) to get <b>the</b> palm; <b>then</b> using <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> hand to get the forearm to <b>the</b> elbow, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> forearm to get the upper arm.|$|R

25|$|At each node or edge, {{there are}} at most 2k sets S for which we need to {{calculate}} these values, so if k is a constant <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> calculation takes constant time per edge or node. The size of the maximum independent set is the largest value stored at the root node, and the maximum independent set itself can be found (as is standard in dynamic programming algorithms) by backtracking through these stored values starting from this largest value. Thus, in graphs of bounded treewidth, the maximum independent set problem may be solved in linear time. Similar algorithms apply to many other graph problems.|$|E
25|$|When auto-changing {{turntables}} were commonplace, {{records were}} typically pressed with a raised (or ridged) outer edge and a raised label area, allowing records to be stacked onto each other without the delicate grooves coming into contact, {{reducing the risk}} of damage. Auto-changers included a mechanism to support a stack of several records above the turntable itself, dropping them one at a time onto the active turntable to be played in order. Many longer sound recordings, such as complete operas, were interleaved across several 10-inch or 12-inch discs for use with auto-changing mechanisms, so that the first disk of a three-disk recording would carry sides 1 and 6 of the program, while the second disk would carry sides 2 and 5, and the third, sides 3 and 4, allowing sides 1, 2, and 3 to be played automatically; <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> stack reversed to play sides 4, 5, and 6.|$|E
25|$|This {{majority}} {{was furious}} {{with the new}} Governor. Besides despising him for switching parties and supporting the hated abolitionists, they thought he had virtually won {{his office at the}} point of a bayonet. The State House refused to allow Cannon the use of its facilities for his inauguration, and a joint committee of the General Assembly said his inaugural message was not only impertinent, but insolent in the extreme, entirely unbecoming a State Executive, especially one elected by “fraud and violence against the known wish of a majority of the citizens of Delaware.” <b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> affair was repeated a year later, when federal troops supervised a special election to fill the seat of deceased U.S. Representative William Temple. This time the Democrats boycotted the election, but they were just biding their time. Finally, once again the elections of 1864 were supervised by federal troops, but this time the Democrats voted and swept the election. Without the veto, Cannon was powerless to accomplish anything with the General Assembly. As if to emphasize the point the General Assembly even rejected Cannon’s request to approve the Thirteenth Amendment, prohibiting slavery. This act had been approved by neighboring border state Maryland, but Delaware’s Democrats would refuse to pass this measure for another generation.|$|E

25|$|Thus, a zpool (ZFS storage pool) is vaguely {{similar to}} a computer's RAM. The total RAM pool {{capacity}} depends {{on the number of}} RAM memory sticks and the size of each stick. Likewise, a zpool consists of one or more vdevs. Each vdev {{can be viewed as a}} group of hard disks (or partitions, or files, etc.). Each vdev should have redundancy, otherwise if a vdev is lost, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> zpool is lost. Thus, each vdev should be configured as RAID-Z1, RAID-Z2, mirror, etc. It is not possible to change the number of drives in an existing vdev (Block Pointer Rewrite will allow this, and also allow defragmentation), but it is always possible to increase storage capacity by adding a new vdev to a zpool. It is possible to swap a drive to a larger drive and resilver (repair) the zpool. If this procedure is repeated for every disk in a vdev, then the zpool will grow in capacity when the last drive is resilvered. A vdev will have the same base capacity as the smallest drive in the group. For instance, a vdev consisting of three 500 GB and one 700GB drive, will have a capacity of 4×500GB.|$|E
500|$|The 9th Brigade {{made their}} way along the rocky Wadi Sir to Baqa, where they saw German {{soldiers}} retiring {{along the road to}} Deir Sheraf. The brigade artillery came into action against this target, initially one section and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of the IX Mountain Artillery Brigade and some machine guns, completely blocking the road with smashed vehicles. The 93rd Burma Infantry reached the road [...] northeast of El Funduq at 15:10, where they captured about 250 prisoners, many of them German. A company of the 2nd Battalion, Dorsetshire Regiment on the extreme left captured 151 prisoners north of Qaryat Hajja.|$|E
500|$|Although Hamming {{had been}} hired to work on {{elasticity}} theory, he still {{spent much of his}} time with the calculating machines. Before he went home on one Friday in 1947, he set the machines to perform a long and complex series of calculations over the weekend, only to find when he arrived on Monday morning that an error had occurred early in the process and the calculation had errored off. Digital machines manipulated information as sequences of zeroes and ones, units of information that Tukey would christen [...] "bits". If a single bit in a sequence was wrong, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> sequence would be. To detect this, a parity bit was used to verify the correctness of each sequence. [...] "If the computer can tell when an error has occurred," [...] Hamming reasoned, [...] "surely there is a way of telling where the error is so that the computer can correct the error itself." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the late}} 19th century {{the village was}} in steep decline. In 1894, Whellan {{described}} Carr Hill as [...] "a scattered village, which... was dotted with windmills, now fallen into ruins, as are many of the houses." [...] Carr Hill Pottery had operated throughout the 19th century, but the once thriving pottery had by 1860 become {{little more than a}} cottage industry, employing a mere 8 employees and paying just £15 per annum in rent. Ownership subsequently transferred to Thomas Patterson, of neighbouring Sheriff Hill Pottery, who eventually closed the Carr Hill works in 1893. The buildings were demolished completely in 1932; only the Old Brown Jug public house and a street named in honour of Warburton survive as reminders of the area's rich pottery heritage. Carr Hill Quarry on Elgin Quarry was infilled and replaced by a school, and although the windmills still stood, none operated as a going concern by 1890, and were instead used as tenement property or storehouses Carr Hill Mill was demolished between 1919 and 1939 as was the last remaining mill in 1963. Elliot's glassworks suffered a similar fate, closing in about 1900 and demolished in 1932. Carr Hill House fell into disrepair and was demolished in 1921. Carr Hill Reservoir survived until 1973, but by <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of Gateshead and Newcastle were supplied by the Newcastle and Water Company from Catcleugh and Whittle Dene in Northumberland and it had become redundant, and was covered soon after.|$|E
500|$|Later, Dr. Lee {{explains}} {{what they are}} dealing with. Gabriel allows Michael {{to come in the}} hospital, but nobody else. Michael enters the building and realizes that he has a [...] "dead man switch", meaning that if Wyath is shot, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> building will blow up. Gabriel goes up near the window to handle a man who is screaming, and the police are prepared to shoot him. However, to prevent Gabriel from using his switch, Michael jumps at him, causing him to divert his path. Gabriel knocks him out, and shortly after injects him with ketamine. Michael suddenly wakes up in his [...] "green reality". Michael is looking for a ring, which is Dr. Wild's. He sees a hallucination of a penguin, caused by the drugs. The penguin tells him that Rex has the ring. He calls him down, and Rex reveals that he stole it for his girlfriend, Emma (Daniela Bobadilla). Michael meets Emma and gets the ring back. Dr. Evans (Cherry Jones) claims that he is [...] "having a nightmare about madness". He wakes up in the [...] "red reality" [...] and sees Dr. Lee helping him. The police are coming in to shoot him. Michael quickly phones and tells them to stop, due to the [...] "dead man switch". Gabriel and Michael talk about Gabriel's two reality life. This makes Michael think about his life. Shortly later, Michael and Dr. Evans are talking about his mind. He thinks about his life and tells her that he is okay. During a subsequent discussion, he finds out that Dr. Lee was not really inside his mind; he was actually helping himself.|$|E
500|$|The Berlin Vossische Zeitung, wrote: [...] "We have {{to count}} on reverses like that near Arras. Such events {{are a kind of}} {{tactical}} reverse. If this tactical reverse is not followed by strategical effects i.e., breaking through {{on the part of the}} aggressor, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> battle is nothing but a weakening of the attacked party in men and materiel." [...] The same day, the Frankfurter Zeitung commented: [...] "If the British succeed in breaking through it will render conditions worse for them as it will result in freedom of operations which is Germany's own special art of war". General Ludendorff was less sanguine. The news of the battle reached him during his 52nd birthday celebrations at his headquarters in Kreuznach. He wrote: [...] "I had looked forward to the expected offensive with confidence and was now deeply depressed". He telephoned each of his commanders and [...] "gained the impression that the principles laid down by OHL were sound but the whole art of leadership lies in applying them correctly". (A later court of inquiry would establish that Falkenhausen had indeed misunderstood the principles of defence in depth.) Ludendorff immediately ordered reinforcements. Then, on 11 April, he sacked Falkenhausen's chief of staff and replaced him with [...] Loßberg. Loßberg went armed with vollmacht (a power of command [...] enabling him to issue orders in the army ccommander's name), replacing Falkenhausen. Within hours of arriving, Loßberg began to restructure the German defences. The British aimed to consolidate the gains made in the first days of the offensive, to keep the initiative and to break through in concert with the French at Aisne. From 16 April, it was apparent that the French part of the Nivelle Offensive on the Aisne had not achieved a breakthrough. Haig continued to attack at Arras, to continue to divert troops from the French on the Aisne.|$|E
