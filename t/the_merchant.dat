50|$|After his father's {{defeat at}} Theodosia, {{as well as}} his own, Leukon's {{subjects}} were not pleased with their king. Leukon suspected that there would be an attempt on the throne, and rallied <b>the</b> <b>merchants</b> to his aid and borrowed whatever money he could from them. He argued that if his throne was lost, <b>the</b> <b>merchants</b> {{would not be able to}} get their money. <b>The</b> <b>merchants</b> then armed themselves and some acted as his bodyguards while others protected the palace, with the help of <b>the</b> <b>merchants,</b> he killed <b>the</b> conspirators.

They {{had intended to}} leave early in 1620, but they were delayed several months due to difficulties in dealing with <b>the</b> <b>Merchant</b> Adventurers, including several changes in plans for the voyage and in financing. The congregation and the other colonists finally boarded the Speedwell in July 1620 in the Dutch port of Delfshaven.|$|E
5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>merchant</b> marine was technologically outdated, {{and slower}} {{than that of}} the First World, it still {{attracted}} a consistent volume of cargo. The reason for the technological backwardness of <b>the</b> <b>merchant</b> marine were First World induced boycotts of Soviet shipping. This led the Soviet Union to become isolated from the international shipping industry, and skip over such important innovations as shipping containers. Under Mikhail Gorbachev's rule the Soviet Union became the largest buyer of new ships in the world. Because of the size of its navy, the Soviet Government advocated for the traditional freedoms of the sea.|$|E
50|$|Chiang Kai-shek led {{his army}} of Whampoa Military Academy {{graduates}} to defeat <b>the</b> <b>merchant's</b> army.

The British led an international flotilla to support <b>the</b> <b>merchants.</b> Chiang seized <b>the</b> western-supplied weapons from <b>the</b> <b>merchants,</b> and battled against them.

5|$|Adhesion problems. The lighter loading {{on their}} driving axles {{meant that they}} were even more prone to wheelslip than <b>the</b> <b>Merchant</b> Navy class, {{requiring}} very careful control when starting a heavy train.

5|$|As with <b>the</b> <b>Merchant</b> Navy class, {{electric}} lighting was provided on both locomotive and footplate, {{powered by a}} steam-powered generator below the footplate. The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and the brake pipe vacuum pressure gauge whilst eliminating dazzle, {{making it easier for}} the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the ergonomics of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and fireman, thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to the fireman, a treadle used steam pressure to open the firehole doors, where the coal is shovelled into the firebox. The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on <b>the</b> <b>Merchant</b> Navy class included steam-powered clasp brakes and the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{problems}} {{with some of}} the more novel features of Bulleid's design, all members of the class were modified by British Railways during the late 1950s, losing their air-smoothed casings in the process. <b>The</b> <b>Merchant</b> Navy class operated until the end of Southern steam in July 1967. A third of the class has survived and can be seen on heritage railways throughout Great Britain.|$|E
