The evolving nature of integrated marketing communications will continue to transform its concepts especially with technologies being developed at a fast pace. Organisations are seeking strategic approaches to gain a competitive advantage which IMC delivers through combining the most dynamic elements and incorporating mediums such as social networks and media enables marketing communications to interconnect globally. As we have identified that the cross-functional approach holds an advantage tactically nevertheless needs the supervision of all departments and senior management to identify internal and external weaknesses so they're rectified to succeed in integration.|$|E

50|$|Pricing {{is one of}} {{the most}} vital and highly demanded {{component}} within the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing</b> mix. It helps consumers to have an image of the standards the firm has to offer through their products, creating firms to have an exceptional reputation in the market. The firm's decision on the price of the product and the pricing strategy impacts the consumer's decision on whether or not to purchase the product. When firms are deciding to consider applying any type of pricing strategy they must be aware of the following reasons in order to make an appropriate choice which will benefit their business. The competition within the market today is extremely high, for this reason, businesses must be attentive to their opponent's actions in order to have the comparative advantage in the market. The technology of internet usage has increased and developed dramatically therefore, price comparisons can be done by customers through online access. Consumers are very selective regarding the purchases they make due to their knowledge of the monetary value. Firms must be mindful of these factor and price their products accordingly.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the author has}} {{reviewed}} in brief advances and obstacles met on {{the way of the}} marketing thought to construct the general <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing.</b> The attention, in considerable part, is focused on understanding general <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing</b> in Russia. Based on analysis of the most important works, made by Western scholars in the field of marketing, the conclusions highlighting a huge work as well as its incompleteness is made. The original classification schemes designed by well-known Western marketing scholars are estimated as the approaches to the general <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing</b> only. The hypotheses concerning a need to use a deductive approach supported by positive instruments of Marxist political economy was formulated. The author has made the conclusion the kit of tools for designing the general <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing</b> is to be added by an analytical knowledge extracted from exact sciences. Finally, a holistic model of emphatically-communicative approach to building general <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing,</b> applicable, to the author’s opinion, to putting in order partial marketing theories (sub-theories) and arranging well-focused theoretical studies in this field of marketing science. general <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing,</b> main category, cost-value approach, market theory evolution, matched marketing filtration, marketing empathy and ecology,...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{academic}} and practitioner literature on urban destination marketing, suggesting that it contains within it a dominant paradigm which the author characterises as 'the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing</b> competitive advantage'. As such, this theory requires towns and cities to differentiate themselves through the provision of unique products, based on which they subsequently undertake branding, market positioning, distribution and other activities through bespoke destination marketing organisations (DMOs). Practice is then contrasted with theory by reference to a discordant strad of the literature {{as well as the}} actual destination marketing currently being undertaken in 60 European towns and cities. The <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing</b> competitive advantage is shown to be an ideal which rarely translates into practice. Irrespective of whether or not a town or city possesses competitive advantage, DMO destination marketing gravitates almost inexorably towards a 'marketing of everything'. Such an approach, in turn, reduces to a bland and monolithic 'theming of urban sameness', all of which is diametrically opposite to what one would expect to be the case as per the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>marketing</b> competitive advantage. The author contends that this gap between theory and practice matters, necessitating a rethinking of how academics and practitioners should in future seek to explain or otherwise account for urban destination marketing...|$|E

These are: (1) science as a spontaneous order; (2) new business models; (3) co-operation in developing technologies; (4) clusters and innovation externalities; and (5) copying processes and local adaptation...|$|R

40|$|An {{economy is}} a coordinated system of {{distributed}} knowledge. Economic evolution occurs as knowledge grows {{and the structure of}} the system changes. This paper is about the role <b>of</b> <b>markets</b> in this process. Traditionally, the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets</b> has not been a central feature of evolutionary economics. This seems to be due to the orthodox view <b>of</b> <b>markets</b> as information-processing mechanisms for finding equilibria. But in economic evolution markets are actually knowledge-structuring mechanisms. What then is the relation between knowledge, information, markets and mechanisms? I argue that an evolutionary <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets,</b> in the manner of Loasby (1999), requires a clear formulation of these relations. I suggest that a conception <b>of</b> knowledge and <b>markets</b> in terms <b>of</b> a graphical <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> complex systems furnishes precisely this.
