Construction began in January 2011, on its own right-of-way parallel to the existing road;, the track was completed in October 2012. The first <b>test</b> <b>run</b> to Lagunen was conducted on 6 December 2012, and the line was {{opened to the public}} on 22 June 2013.|$|E
5|$|During the drawn Third Test, opening batsman Sid Barnes was injured. This {{opened up}} a vacancy for the Fourth Test. Hamence made 30 as Australia {{defeated}} Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match before the Fourth Test at Headingley. Hamence was overlooked for the vacancy as Harvey was called in. Australia scored 3/404 to set a world record for the highest successful <b>Test</b> <b>run</b> chase; Harvey scored a century.|$|E

Then in October 2007 the same crew ran the first powered complete <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> {{of the same}} test cars, and gave the roller coaster enthusiasts a tour during the Phoenix Phall Phunfest 2007. Later that month they began to <b>run</b> <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> of a five-car test train {{which will be the}} full length of the train.|$|R

The water has been dyed with the 'Blue Lagoon' aquatic dye to control the growth of algae and bacteria. The nontoxic aquatic dye attenuates the penetration of light into the water, and tints the water blue.|$|E
5|$|On March 17, 2007, seven {{employees}} received {{minor injuries}} when their seats changed position during a <b>test</b> <b>run</b> of the roller coaster. An inspection {{discovered that the}} ride operator accidentally pushed a button controlling the seat positions while the ride was in motion. That button was later modified to only work when the ride is stopped.|$|E

When dropped from the Yorkshire team in 1986 he was the leading run scorer in first-class cricket. In 1965, while still a young player, he had been named as one of five Cricketers of the Year by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and he was inducted into the International Cricket Council's Hall of Fame in 2009.|$|E
5|$|An {{accident}} occurred aboard K-152 Nerpa at 8:30 PM {{local time}} on 8 November 2008, during an underwater <b>test</b> <b>run</b> in the Pacific Ocean. A total of 208 people – 81 {{military personnel and}} 127 civilians – were on board {{at the time of}} the accident. At least 20 people were killed by asphyxiation and at least 21 more were injured, making it the worst Russian submarine disaster since Kursk sank in 2000. Three of the dead were military personnel and the rest were civilians from the Vostok, Zvezda, Era and Amur shipbuilding yards who were members of the acceptance team.|$|E
5|$|As {{they travel}} together, Natalie {{questions}} Ryan's philosophies on life, particularly on relationships and love, but Ryan is adamant {{that he is}} more than happy with his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie is shattered when her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by text message, and Ryan and Alex try to comfort her. Natalie later lectures Ryan about his refusal to consider a commitment to Alex {{in spite of their}} obvious compatibility, and becomes infuriated; she apologizes later, but soon afterward they are both ordered back to Omaha to implement Natalie's program. On the <b>test</b> <b>run,</b> the earlier concerns Ryan raised prove valid; one laid-off person breaks down in tears before the camera, and Natalie is unable to comfort him.|$|E

5|$|Centaur entered {{operation}} as {{a hospital}} ship on 12 March 1943. The {{early stages of}} Centaur's first voyage as a hospital ship were test and transport runs; the initial run from Melbourne to Sydney resulted in the Master, Chief Engineer, and Chief Medical Officer composing {{a long list of}} defects requiring attention. Following repairs, she conducted a <b>test</b> <b>run,</b> transporting wounded servicemen from Townsville to Brisbane to ensure that she was capable of fulfilling the role of a medical vessel. Centaur was then tasked with delivering medical personnel to Port Moresby, New Guinea, and returning to Brisbane with Australian and American wounded along with a small number of wounded Japanese prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|In 2069, Agent Miles Kilo, EuroCorp's latest agent, is {{equipped}} with the new prototype DART 6 chip created by Eurocorp scientist Lily Drawl (voiced by Rosario Dawson). After a successful <b>test</b> <b>run</b> of the chip's abilities, EuroCorp CEO Jack Denham (voiced by Brian Cox) assigns him to kill Lily's counterpart, Chang, at the rival syndicate Aspari. Accompanied by his mentor Agent Jules Merit (voiced by Michael Wincott), Kilo attacks the Los Angeles branch of Aspari and corners Chang, who shoots himself. Kilo retrieves Chang's chip and learns from an encrypted conversation that Lily has been sharing information about the DART 6 chip with him.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the second}} innings in Adelaide saw England set Australia a near-impossible 532 for victory; even today, the highest {{successful}} <b>Test</b> <b>run</b> chase is 418. Australia lost its first wicket at three when Jack Fingleton was bowled by Larwood. Woodfull {{was joined by}} Bradman, who played in an unorthodox counterattacking method, before being dismissed for 66. Woodfull continued on to score an unbeaten 73, carrying his bat as his teammates capitulated around him. Australia was eventually all out for 193, with Oldfield unable to bat due to his fractured skull.|$|E

5|$|On {{an early}} <b>test</b> <b>run</b> the R engine {{produced}} 1,400hp (1,040kW) and was noted to idle happily at 450revolutions per minute (rpm). With increased boost ratings and fuel developed by Banks, the R engine ultimately developed 2,530hp (1,890kW) at 3,200rpm; well over double the maximum power {{output of the}} Buzzard. The engine was further tested and cleared for limited sprint racing at 2,783hp (2,075kW) at 3,400rpm and +21lb (1.45bar) of boost, but this capability was not used due to concerns with the S.6B's airframe {{not being able to}} withstand the power, and the inability of the aircraft to lift the extra fuel required to meet the increased consumption.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the grass}} on the putting greens was the wide-bladed Bermuda. The greens lost speed, {{especially}} during the late 1970s, after {{the introduction of a}} healthier strain of narrow-bladed Bermuda, which thrived and grew thicker. In 1978, the greens on the par 3 course were reconstructed with bentgrass, a narrow-bladed species that could be mowed shorter, eliminating grain. After this <b>test</b> <b>run,</b> the greens on the main course were replaced with bentgrass in time for the 1981 Masters. The bentgrass resulted in significantly faster putting surfaces, which has required a reduction in some of the contours of the greens over time.|$|E

On July 26, GSN announced plans to renew the show for a second season, which began airing on August 16, 2010. A syndication <b>test</b> <b>run</b> was shown on {{a select group of}} Sinclair Broadcast Group's stations January 10, 2011. The series began airing in syndication in the United States in September 2012, becoming the first original program in the network's history to achieve such a feat.|$|E
5|$|While {{performing}} a <b>test</b> <b>run</b> {{prior to the}} park opening on July 9, 2013, one of the roller coaster trains became stuck {{near the top of}} the lift hill. The train was eventually brought down a week later, and the ride remained closed for more than two months. Kings Dominion later explained the closure through a statement released on their official Facebook page on August 28, 2013, which stated that a problem with the weight distribution on the gearbox caused a part to warp and fail. The replacement part had to be custom-built in another country, causing the extended closure. The ride eventually reopened on September 14, 2013.|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper [8], {{it was shown}} how tests for {{database}} application systems can be executed ef-ficiently. The challenge was to control {{the state of the}} database during testing and to order the <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> {{in such a way that}} expensive reset operations that bring the database into the right state need to be executed as seldom as possible. This work ex-tends that work so that <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> can be executed in parallel. The goal is to achieve linear speed-up and/or exploit the available resources as well as possible. This problem is challenging because parallel testing can involve interference between the execution of concurrent <b>test</b> <b>runs.</b> ...|$|R
