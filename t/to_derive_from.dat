5|$|The {{origin of}} the word walrus is thought by J.R.R. Tolkien <b>to</b> <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> a Germanic language, {{and it has been}} {{attributed}} largely to either the Dutch language or Old Norse. Its first part is thought <b>to</b> <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> a word such as Dutch walvis 'whale'. Its second part has also been hypothesized to come from the Old Norse word for 'horse'. For example, the Old Norse word hrossvalr means 'horse-whale' and is thought to have been passed in an inverted form to both Dutch and the dialects of northern Germany as walros and Walross. An alternate theory is that is comes from the Dutch words wal 'shore' and reus 'giant'.|$|E
5|$|The {{cross is}} thought to date from the tenth century, and {{exhibits}} distinctive Hiberno-Scottish mission influences, in common with several other monuments in the area. Tradition and folk etymology suggest that the cross marked the burial site of Camus, leader of the Norse army purportedly defeated by King Malcolm II at the apocryphal Battle of Barry. The name of the stone is likely <b>to</b> <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> the extinct village of Camuston, which has a Celtic toponymy.|$|E

5|$|The term 'clock' {{encompasses}} {{a wide spectrum}} of devices, ranging from wristwatches to the Clock of the Long Now. The English word clock is said <b>to</b> <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> the Middle English clokke, Old North French cloque, or Middle Dutch clocke, all of which mean bell, and are derived from the Medieval Latin clocca, also meaning bell. Indeed, bells were used to mark the passage of time; they marked the passage of the hours at sea and in abbeys.|$|E
5|$|Udale, {{located in}} Cromarty, Scotland, is first {{recorded}} in 1578, and is thought <b>to</b> <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> Old Norse y-dalr. Robert Bevan-Jones proposes {{a connection between}} veneration of Ullr and Ýdalir among the settling pagan Norse in Scotland and their bestowment of the name ydalr to the location.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Lorentz more {{generally}} explained Fresnel's coefficient {{based on the}} concept of local time. However, Lorentz's theory had the same fundamental problem as Fresnel's: a stationary aether contradicted the Michelson–Morley experiment. So in 1892 Lorentz proposed that moving bodies contract in the direction of motion (FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction hypothesis, since George FitzGerald had already arrived in 1889 at this conclusion). The equations that he used to describe these effects were further developed by him until 1904. These are now called the Lorentz transformations in his honor, and are identical in form to the equations that Einstein was later <b>to</b> <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> first principles. Unlike Einstein's equations, however, Lorentz's transformations were strictly ad hoc, their only justification being that they seemed to work.|$|E

5|$|The name of {{the cross}} is likely <b>to</b> <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> the village of Camuston. No trace of this village can be seen today, and it had ceased to exist {{by the time of}} the first Ordnance Survey map, {{published}} in 1888, but surveyed in 1857 to 1859. Its former location is indicated in the 1794 map by Ainslie, about half a mile to the east of the cross. Camuston can be found with earlier spelling variations, for example, 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425 and 1426, and has a Celtic rather than Scandinavian etymology.|$|E
5|$|The {{family name}} of Dokeianos is {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> Dokia in the Armeniac Theme. The family only came into {{prominence in the}} mid-11th century, with Michael {{one of the first}} to be mentioned. He is generally considered as the Dokeianos who married an unnamed daughter of Manuel Erotikos Komnenos and sister of the future emperor Isaac I Komnenos (reigned 1057–59), probably ca. 1030. Together, they had a son, Theodore Dokeianos. According to the near-contemporary official and historian John Skylitzes, Michael Dokeianos was a simple man and not suited for command, and according to the modern scholar Konstantinos Varzos he owed his rise to high office to his family ties with the Komnenoi. It is known that he was wealthy, and possessed estates in Paphlagonia, possibly adjacent or part of the Komnenos family estates in the same region.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Brasenose College, Oxford {{stretches}} back to 1509, when the college {{was founded on}} the site of Brasenose Hall. Its name is believed <b>to</b> <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> the name of a bronze knocker that adorned the hall's door. The college was associated with Lancashire and Cheshire, the county origins of its two founders– Sir Richard Sutton and the Bishop of Lincoln, William Smyth– a link that was maintained strongly until {{the latter half of the}} nineteenth century. The first principals navigated Brasenose, with its Catholic sympathisers, through the reformation and continuing religious reforms. Most of Brasenose favoured the Royalist side during the English Civil War, although it produced notable generals and clergy on both sides. The library and chapel were completed in the mid-seventeenth century, despite Brasenose suffering continuing financial problems.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} at Great Falls of the Passaic River in New Jersey was selected due to access to raw materials, it being densely inhabited, and {{having access to}} water power from the falls of the Passaic. The factory town was named Paterson after New Jersey's Governor William Paterson, who signed the charter. The profits were <b>to</b> <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> specific corporates rather than the benefits to be conferred to {{the nation and the}} citizens, which was unlike the report. Hamilton also suggested the first stock to be offered at $500,000 and to eventually increase to $1million, and welcomed state and national government subscriptions alike. The company was never successful: numerous shareholders reneged on stock payments, some members soon went bankrupt, and William Duer, the governor of the program, was sent to debtors' prison. In spite of Hamilton's efforts to mend the disaster, the company would expire by 1796.|$|E
5|$|The {{research}} into {{the reconstruction of the}} consonants of Middle Mongol has engendered several controversies. Middle Mongol had two series of plosives, but there is disagreement as to which phonological dimension they lie on, whether aspiration or voicing. The early scripts have distinct letters for velar plosives and uvular plosives, but as these are in complementary distribution according to vowel harmony class, only two back plosive phonemes, */k/, * (~ *, *) are to be reconstructed. One prominent long running disagreement concerns certain correspondences of word medial consonants among the four major scripts (UM, SM, AM, and Ph, which were discussed in the preceding section). Word medial /k/ of Uyghur Mongolian (UM) has, not one, but two correspondences with the three other scripts: either /k/ or zero. Traditional scholarship has reconstructed */k/ for both correspondences, arguing that */k/ got lost in some instances, which raises the question of what the conditioning factors of those instances were. More recently, the other obvious possibility has been assumed, namely that the correspondence between UM /k/ and zero in the other scripts points to a distinct phoneme, /h/, which would correspond to the word-initial phoneme /h/ that is present in those other scripts. /h/ (sometimes also called /x/) is sometimes assumed <b>to</b> <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> *, which would also explain zero in SM, AM, Ph in some instances where UM indicates /p/, e.g. debel > Khalkha deel.|$|E
