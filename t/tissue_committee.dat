40|$|Fibronectin (Fn) is an {{integral}} protein in the Extracellular matrix (ECM) and {{is known for its}} ability to lengthen under mechanical strain. It is hypothesized that this ability is based on unfolding of the protein s tertiary structure, exposing integrin-binding domains that serve as cellular binding partners. It is through this interaction that cellular processes, such as mechanotransduction, may occur. The current methods of tracking the mechanical state of Fn is through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), which is limited to in vitro testing and is not applicable to studying Fn in tissue. It is the goal of this study to evaluate an alternative approach to tracking the mechanical unfolding of Fn. By implementing phage display, Fn fibers in relaxed and strained mechanical states were exposed to the fuse 5 library to locate high affinity binders. The results produced a peptide sequence complementary to binding sites specific to the relaxed and strained states. By applying fluorophores to these high affinity binders, molecular probes can be created to quantify mechanical strain undergone by Fn in <b>tissue.</b> <b>Committee</b> Member/Second Reader: Santangelo, Philip; Faculty Mentor: Barker, Thoma...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: When {{surgical}} pathology reports are dispatched {{to patients and}} clinicians, sometimes they are discovered to have errors, {{and it is a}} common practice for the pathologists to issue amended reports. Measuring the rate at which {{surgical pathology}} reports are amended {{can be used as a}} tool for assuring quality control in histopathology. AIM: The aim of this study was determine the parameters that can be used as an assessment tool to minimize errors in histopathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was carried out at a major histopathology center. The duration of this study was from January 2001 through January 2011 (ten years). Following parameters were looked for: Interpretational errors, permanent and frozen section correlation, intradepartmental consultation and cases sent for second opinion, cases brought in <b>tissue</b> <b>committee</b> meetings, audits, and cases discussed in hospital meetings. RESULTS: A total of 28, 1931 surgical pathology cases were signed out during the ten-year period. On these, addendums were issued on 5730 cases (2. 0 %). Additional report issued on 3521 (1. 3 %).

40|$|The {{earliest}} {{function of}} the Professional Standards Review Organization (PSRO) will be to conduct or supervise, for federally financed patients in short-term hospitals, concurrent certifications and reviews and medical care evaluation studies. Case and statutory law, as well as PL 92 - 603, make the hospital itself responsible {{for the quality of}} its care, and the PSRO must accept those of the hospital's review services that are of satisfactory quality. The workable hospital quality control system described relies on comprehensive statistical monitoring of both outcome and process of care to [1] provide reasonable surveillance of the care of all patients, and [2] establish priorities for in-depth investigations and concurrent review. Monitor-triggered medical care evaluation studies include deficiency analysis, prescribe corrective action and follow-up, and provide documentation. A PSRO need not duplicate these studies, done as a normal hospital function. Concurrent certification and review will have to be worked out between the PSRO and hospital.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{clinical and}} treatment characteristics of renal soft tissue sarcomas in children, we analyzed {{a series of}} patients enrolled in the protocols coordinated by the Italian Soft <b>Tissue</b> Sarcoma <b>Committee</b> (STSC). METHODS: From 1979 to 2011, 2138 patients with soft tissue sarcomas were registered in different STSC protocols, and 12 had a renal sarcoma: 7 primitive peripheral neuroectodermal tumors, 2 undifferentiated sarcomas, 1 rhabdomyosarcoma, 1 desmoplastic small round cell tumor, and 1 kaposiform hemangioendothelioma. Treatment included conservative surgery, chemotherapy according to the guidelines of the protocols, and radiotherapy for high-risk patients. RESULTS: Nephrectomy was performed in 11 children resulting in a complete tumor resection in 7. In 4 patients, macroscopical (1) or microscopic (3) tumor residuals remained postoperatively. Tumorectomy was performed in patients with congenital renal agenesis. All patients received chemotherapy. Seven patients also received postoperative radiotherapy. Overall, 9 patients are alive in first complete remission with a median follow-up of 6. 1 years (range, 1. 3 - 21. 1 years). Two of the 7 patients with primitive peripheral neuroectodermal tumors (pPNETs) died after an early relapse: 1 had metastatic disease at diagnosis {{and the other was}} initially misdiagnosed with Wilms tumor (WT).

These two phantoms are CT-based, and thus {{do not have}} the image resolution to delineate and perform radiation transport modeling of the individual marrow cavities and bone trabeculae throughout their skeletal structures. Furthermore, new and innovative 3 D microimaging techniques will now be required for the skeletal <b>tissues</b> following <b>Committee</b> 2 ’s revision of the target tissues of relevance for radiogenic bone cancer induction. This target tissue had been defined in ICRP Publication 30 as a 10 -m cell layer on all bone surfaces of trabecular and cortical bone. The revised target tissue is now a 50 -m layer within the marrow cavities of trabecular bone only and is exclusive of the marrow adipocytes. Clearly, this new definition requires the use of 3 D microimages of the trabecular architecture not available from past 2 D optical studies of the adult skeleton. With our recent acquisition of two relatively young cadavers (males of age 18 -years and 40 -years), we will develop a series of reference skeletal models that can be directly applied to (1) the new ICRP reference voxel man and female phantoms developed for the ICRP, and (2) pediatric phantoms developed to target the ICRP reference children.

40|$|Key to {{the success}} of natural and {{engineered}} tissues becoming clinically available until needed is their long-term storage at low temperatures. This can be implemented by means of freezing or vitrification. To this end, vitrification offers an attractive approach for tissue banking by forming an amorphous glass both intra- and extracellularly and thereby avoiding the harmful effects of ice formation. Generally, high concentrations of cryoprotectants (CPAs) are used in conjunction with high cooling and warming rates to achieve this. However, hurdles associated with applying this technique include the ability to adequately deliver and remove CPAs due to cellular osmotic and cytotoxic effects as well as achieving adequate cooling and warming rates throughout the tissue to avoid ice formation. The aim of this work was to account for these factors in designing cryopreservation protocols for native and engineered tissues that had intrinsically different characteristics, including tissue size and extracellular matrix properties. The tissues investigated were two types of three-dimensional, cell encapsulated systems consisting of murine insulinomas and murine embryonic stem cells, and native articular cartilage. A mathematical 3 -D CPA transport model was developed to predict cell volume excursions and intracellular CPA equilibration and applied to cryopreserve an engineered tissue.

The Italian Soft <b>Tissue</b> Sarcoma (STS) <b>Committee</b> performed a multiinstitutional Phase 11 study to evaluate its effect on STS. METHODS. over a 2 -year period between 2002 and 2004, 32 heavily pretreated patients were administered 60 -minute infusions of irinotecan at 20 mg/m(2) /day, for 5 days a week, for 2 consecutive weeks. The Courses were repeated every 4 weeks for at least 2 courses, unless {{there were signs of}} toxicity or disease progression. Thirty patients, 13 with peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), 12 with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), 3 with desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), and 2 with other STS were evaluable for response. RESULTS. A total of 79 cycles were delivered. The main regimen-related toxicity was diarrhea, occurring in 58 % of cycles with 9 episodes graded as 3 or 4. Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia was recorded in 10 % of cycles. The overall response rate was 23 % (2 complete remissions + 5 partial remissions of 30 patients), 38 % for PNET and 16 % for RMS.

40|$|Aim Lipoaspirate, a wasted {{by product}} from liposuction {{procedure}} recently {{has been shown}} to contain abundant mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs have been studied in many research areas to regenerate many cell lineages including, myogenic, cardiomyogenic, and angiogenic lineages. The large quantity of MSCs in lipoaspirate, makes it an attractive source for stem cells used in research and clinical applications. A simplified method which is suitable to be performed in a basic laboratory will facilitate development of stem cell research in developing countries. Therefore the outcomes from this study are expected to encourage the progress of stem cell research in Indonesia. Methods Lipoaspirate was digested using collagenase type I, followed by a basic filtration method. Purification of MSCs was done by cell culture for 2 - 3 days followed by supernatant removal. To confirm the homogenous population of MSCs, an analysis using flowcytometry was performed based on the MSCs minimal criteria developed by Mesenchymal and <b>Tissue</b> Stem Cell <b>Committee</b> of the International Society of Cell Therapy. Resuts MSCs were able to be obtained at 16. 41 ± 8. 22 x 10 8 cells per 120 ml lipoaspirate. The cultured cells showed fibroblastic morphology which is characteristic for MSCs and were able to be purified from non-MSCs cells. This was confirmed by flowcytometry assay showing expression of CD 105 and the absence of HLA-Class II, CD 45, CD 34, CD 14, and CD 19.

40|$|Equispaced beam {{arrangements}} are typically used for IMRT plans. This beam arrangement provides adequate dose coverage {{to the target}} while sparing dose to other structures. However, an equispaced beam arrangement may not provide the best dose coverage to the target while sparing dose to the other structures. Beam angle optimization attempts to optimize the beam directions to produce a better IMRT plan; this is achieved by increasing dose to the target while minimizing dose to the remaining structures. Most methods of beam angle optimization attempt to optimize the beam angles and the beam intensity profiles to find an optimal set of beam angles. This thesis attempts to optimize the beam angles without determining the beam intensity profiles. An MCNP simulation is run to score the beam directions; the simulation is run as an adjoint problem to reduce simulation time, with the target as the source and the detectors scoring the dose for the gantry angles of the beam. Then, an optimization algorithm is run to select a set of beam angles for an optimized IMRT plan. The optimized IMRT plan is compared to an equispaced IMRT plan on a commercial treatment planning system to determine if this method of beam angle optimization is better than using an equispaced beam arrangement. The results of this thesis indicate that the coupling of an MCNP simulation for scoring with an optimization algorithm to select beam angles will produce a better IMRT plan than an equispaced IMRT plan. Three different geometries were used and for all geometries, the optimized IMRT plan had a higher average dose to the target while maintaining or increasing dose sparing to the critical structure and normal <b>tissue.</b> M.

The primary goal of the PhD was analyzing new therapeutic strategies for resistant solid tumors children. The work moved from data analysis on adolescents with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and resistant RMS patients treated with a new second line topotecan (T) /carboplatin (C) based regimen, through a specific training in clinical trials management to obtain the necessary expertise to write down a phase II trial for resistant RMS patients. In the last decades in many types of cancer the survival rates are reported to be less favorable in adolescents compared with younger children. To investigate whether this is true for adolescents with RMS, the results obtained in patients enrolled in protocols run by the Italian STSC were analyzed. Our study concluded that the higher prevalence of unfavorable tumor characteristics among adolescents seems to explain their worse outcome, the limited number of adolescents enrolled in STSC studied is worrisome and cooperation with adult oncologists needs to be improved. Another bad result is about prognosis of children with metastatic or resistant RMS: there is a strong need to find new strategies to improve the outcome of these patients. T and C are known to have activity against a variety of pediatric tumors so a T/C based chemotherapy has been proposed as second line CT for children relapsed after being treated in the STSC protocols. Our study shows that the T/C combination is tolerable in heavily pretreated patients; the response rate (RR) is somewhat lower when compared to other combinations tested in phase II studies but it’s of interest for the population with alveolar subtype. Clinical trials {{are one of the most}} important tools to explore new therapeutic approaches; for this reason the PhD involved a specific training in clinical trials management through participation to courses ad hoc, creation of a team committed to new drugs environment, participation to international phase II and III trials. During the last part of PhD the efforts were coordinated to write a phase II trial on treatment of leptomeningeal dissemination by RMS. Neoplastic meningitis is a devasting complication of both solid and hematologic tumors and despite treatment the median survival duration is in the range of 8 - 16 weeks. Among available therapeutic approaches intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy is one of the most widely used even if no impact on survival has been demonstrated. Few anticancer agents are used in this setting, therefore it’s essential to develop new IT agents with novel mechanism of action.

In the dog many districts have been investigated for MSC but never the female genital tract. In the last decade, progenitor cells isolated from dissociated endometrial tissue, {{have been the subject of}} many studies in several animal species. Recently, endometrial cells showing characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been demonstrated in human, pig and cow uterine tissue samples. The aim of the present study was simultaneously studied the tissue collected from three different sites: ovarian bursa adipose tissue, endometrium and abdominal adipose tissue, used as control. All isolated cells were able to adhere to plastic support, showed similar fibroblastic-like morphology and ability of subculture; MSC isolated from abdominal adipose tissue and endometrium showed ability to generate colony-forming units, plasticity and expressed specific surface antigens. Conversely cells isolated from ovarian bursa adipose tissue did not express specific surface antigens and did not show ability to generate colony-forming units and plasticity. Multipotent stromal cells could be isolated from all bitches anrolled in the study (n= 7). The multipotecncy of cells was demonstrated by their capacity to differentiate into adypocytic, osteocytic and chondrocytic lineages. Clonogenicity and cell proliferation ability were also tested. Furthermore, gene expression analysis by RT-PCR was used to compare the expression of a set of genes (CD 44, CD 29, CD 34, CD 45, CD 90, CD 13, CD 133, CD 73, CD 31 CD 105, Oct 4) with adipose tissue derived MSC. Stromal cells isolated from uterine endometrium showed similar morphology, ability of subculture and plasticity, and also expressed a panel of genes comparable with adipose tissue 4 derived MSC.

40|$|Long-term {{storage of}} tissue by {{cryopreservation}} {{is necessary for}} the efficient mass production of tissue engineered products, and for reducing the urgency and cost of organ transplantation procedures. The goal of this work was to investigate the physical processes thought result in damage during tissue cryopreservation towards development of tissue cryopreservation strategies. Although mathematical models of cell dehydration and intracellular ice formation (IIF) have been successfully used to optimize cryopreservation procedures for cell suspensions, it is not currently possible to use this approach with tissue {{because of the lack of}} tissue-specific permeability parameters for predicting cell dehydration during tissue freezing, and because of the increased complexity of the IIF process in tissue. We have measured the membrane permeability properties of tissue comprising a cell monolayer using a fluorescence quenching technique, and compared the results to the corresponding cell suspensions, revealing significant differences in the membrane transport kinetics between monolayers and suspensions. These data enabled the prediction cell dehydration during freezing of cell monolayers. Whereas the mechanisms of IIF are relatively well understood in cell suspensions, tissue is susceptible to new IIF mechanisms. In particular, cell-cell interactions have been shown to increase the IIF probability by enabling the propagation of ice between neighboring cells. We investigated the effect of cell-cell interactions on IIF using genetically modified cells expressing different levels of intercellular junction proteins. A new IIF mechanism was observed in these cells associated with penetration of extracellular ice into the cell-cell interface, and the incidence of this IIF mechanism was reduced in cells expressing the tight junction protein occludin. In addition, we investigated the effect of the cytoplasm supercooling and viscosity on the kinetics of IIF in tissue. We found that increasing the viscosity or decreasing the supercooling significantly decreased the kinetics of IIF, suggesting that IIF protocols for tissue can be optimized by modulating the cytoplasm supercooling and viscosity. Together, these data represent an important step towards developing cryopreservation strategies for <b>tissue.</b> Ph.

The fiber structure and morphology was studied using WAXD and SEM. The effect of two-stage heat drawing, sonication time for CNF dispersion, fiber drying temperature, and molecular weight of PAN was also studied. Other challenges associated with processing high concentrations of solutions for making composite fibers have been identified and reported. The effect of CNT diameter and concentration on fiber spinnability and electrical conductivity of composite fiber have also been studied. This work suggests that CNT diameter controls the maximum possible concentration of CNTs in a composite fiber. The results show that by properly choosing the type of CNT, length of CNTs, dispersion of CNTs, fiber spinning method, fiber draw ratio, and type of polymer, one can get electrically conducting fibers with wide range of conductivities for different applications. The PEK based control and composite fibers possess high thermal stability with almost no weight loss up to 500 degree C and negligible thermal shrinkage up to 200 degree C. The PEK based fibers showed high toughness which surpassed many of the high-performance fibers like Kevlar(R) and Zylon(R). The 10 % FWNT containing fiber is unique in terms of high electrical conductivity and high toughness. The CNT based fibers may be used as structural material, fire-barrier/protection textile, electrode for electrochemical capacitor or fuel cells, and as a template for directional growth of <b>tissues.</b> Ph.
