5|$|Although most justices were {{immediately}} convinced, Warren {{spent some time}} after this famous speech convincing everyone to sign onto the opinion. Justices Jackson and Reed finally decided <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>their</b> dissent. The final decision was unanimous. Warren drafted the basic opinion and kept circulating and revising it until he had an opinion endorsed by {{all the members of}} the Court. Reed was the last holdout and reportedly cried during the reading of the opinion.|$|E

He is restricted to communicating through Take-Two's attorneys on any future matter, but is able to maintain his outspoken stance against their titles and may act as counsel in lawsuits against Take-Two by other parties. For their part, Take-Two agreed to drop the contempt of court lawsuit against Thompson regarding alleged improper conduct during the court hearings for Rockstar's game Bully in 2006.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, {{members of}} Georgia Tech's college Republican club sued Georgia Tech, {{aided by the}} Alliance Defense Fund, in a case known as Sklar v. Clough that lasted until April 2008.

Clough stepped down after almost fourteen years as President on July 1, 2008, which he previously announced in an email to students and staff on March 15, 2008.|$|E
5|$|According to French {{intelligence}} reports, the Turks sent political {{agents to}} northern Syria {{to persuade the}} inhabitants <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>their</b> armed resistance to the French and embrace French rule, which they claimed would benefit the population. Sometime between April and May, Hananu had Uwaid execute field commander Mustafa Asim Bey for his involvement in an attack against the mostly Christian town of al-Suqaylabiyah, in which many of its inhabitants were killed. Asim Bey was a strongly pro-Ottoman, Arab officer with particularly close connections to the Anatolian insurgency. Hananu believed that the Turks had instructed him {{to carry out the}} raids on al-Suqaylabiyah and other villages to tarnish the image of the rebels among the local inhabitants, as part of Turkey's agreements with France to stifle the revolt in northern Syria. Asim's execution {{may have contributed to the}} rapid withdrawal of the rebels' Turkish military advisers who were upset with the execution.|$|E

50|$|Hazelnuts are {{harvested}} annually in mid-autumn. As autumn {{comes to a}} close, the trees <b>drop</b> <b>their</b> nuts and leaves. Most commercial growers wait for the nuts <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> on <b>their</b> own, rather than using equipment to shake them from the tree. The harvesting of hazelnuts is performed either by hand or, by manual or mechanical raking of fallen nuts.|$|R
60|$|But the devilish {{ingenuity}} {{of these}} cruel, wicked wretches supplied them with other means than a direct attack upon the Cassandra, for, {{when they had}} come within about {{a mile or so}} of us, they hove <b>to,</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>their</b> main-sail, and, running out great oars from the ports between decks, began rowing towards us in a clumsy fashion, somewhat after the manner of a galleon. By this means, and by the aid of the current which set towards us, they were enabled to keep nearly broadside on, and so avoid being raked by our fire.|$|R
5|$|Al-Qassam's militia grew when it {{was joined}} by another militia based in the {{mountains}} {{following the death of}} its commander Umar al-Bitar. However, as the French tightened their control of the area, they were able to successfully pressure several of Jableh's major landowners <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>their</b> financial support for al-Qassam and pay taxes to the French Mandate government. This further isolated al-Qassam who decided to flee Mount Sahyun for Aleppo in May 1920. There he and his fighters joined ranks with Ibrahim Hananu who was leading attacks against the French Army until the latter captured Jisr ash-Shugur in July. As a result of this French victory and the impending capitulation of Aleppo, al-Qassam and members of his unit fled past French Army lines with forged passports to Tartus.|$|E
5|$|Garland's {{history with}} CBS {{prior to the}} series was a {{checkered}} one. She had previously headlined several specials for the network. The first was the inaugural episode of the Ford Star Jubilee which aired in 1955. The special, the first full-scale color telecast on CBS, was a ratings triumph, garnering a 34.8 Nielsen rating. This success led to Garland's signing a three-year, $300,000 contract with the network. Only a single special aired, a live General Electric Theater episode in 1956, before the pact was terminated. The relationship between CBS and Garland and her then-husband and manager, Sid Luft, dissolved in acrimony in 1957 after they and agent Freddie Fields were unable {{to come to terms}} with the network over the format of her next special. Garland filed a US$1.4 million lawsuit against CBS for libel and breach of contract (CBS filed a counterclaim) that was not settled until 1961, when Garland and CBS each agreed <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>their</b> claims and negotiations began for a new round of Garland specials for the network.|$|E
5|$|Wien Air Alaska, {{which had}} its {{headquarters}} in Fairbanks, was the state's largest private employer until it declared bankruptcy in 1983. The resulting shutdown cost hundreds of jobs in Fairbanks. This was a foretaste of more problems to come. In 1986, Saudi Arabia boosted oil production and oil prices plummeted. Alaska banks failed, construction came to a halt, and bankruptcies and foreclosures were common. A common practice in Fairbanks was for workers <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>their</b> house keys off at local banks before catching a flight out of Alaska, the better to speed the foreclosure process. Although an expansion of Fort Wainwright helped the construction industry during this time, Fairbanks lost about 3,000 jobs between 1986 and 1989. The U.S. Army's 6th Infantry Division was stationed at Fort Wainwright in late 1987, but it {{was reduced to a}} single brigade and renamed in 1993.|$|E

5|$|Aerial predators of the Atlantic puffin {{include the}} {{great black-backed gull}} (Larus marinus), the great skua (Stercorarius skua), and similar-sized species, which can catch a bird in flight, or attack one that is unable to escape fast enough on the ground. On {{detecting}} danger, puffins take off and fly down {{to the safety of}} the sea or retreat into their burrows, but if caught they defend themselves vigorously with beak and sharp claws. When the puffins are wheeling round beside the cliffs it becomes very difficult for a predator to concentrate on a single bird while any individual isolated on the ground is at greater risk. Smaller gull species like the herring gull (L. argentatus) and the lesser black-backed gull are hardly able to bring down a healthy adult puffin. They stride through the colony taking any eggs that have rolled towards burrow entrances or recently hatched chicks that have ventured too far towards the daylight. They will also steal fish from puffins returning to feed their young. Where it nests on the tundra in the far north, the Arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus) is a terrestrial predator, but at lower latitudes it is a specialised kleptoparasite, concentrating on auks and other seabirds. It harasses puffins while they are airborne forcing them <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>their</b> catch which it then snatches up.|$|E
25|$|On 11 January 2013, Hicks and Gillett {{finally decided}} <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>their</b> {{case in the}} English Law Courts against Sir Martin Broughton, Christian Purslow and Ian Ayre, the three {{directors}} {{on the board of}} Liverpool F.C. {{at the time of the}} sale of the club to NESV. They also agreed <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>their</b> case against NESV and RBS Bank. The terms of the agreement are confidential, though it is believed that no monies were paid to Hicks or Gillett. Earlier in the week, Hicks and Gillett had lost a Court of Appeal bid to delay a High Court Trial, so they could have more time to raise the monies needed to fund the multi million pound lawsuit.|$|E

Vezina perfected the [...] "stand up" [...] style of goaltending {{in an era when}} goaltenders were not allowed <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> knees to cover the puck, and became the standard by which future goaltenders judged themselves.|$|R
