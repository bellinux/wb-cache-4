The development of space-based ADS-B will allow precise control of aircraft {{in areas that}} are not covered by radar, such as oceanic regions and high latitudes. The Royal Military College of Canada has developed a spaceborne ADS-B receiver scheduled to fly on the Canadian Advanced Nanospace eXperiment- 7 (CanX- 7) satellite. The payload is planned to collect data over the North Atlantic region, which will then be compared to truth data provided by air traffic services. A model was created to determine power levels arriving at the satellite to provide confidence in the ADS-B receiver and antenna proposed for CanX- 7. The model takes into account neutral atmosphere and ionospheric effects, aircraft-satellite geometry, and antenna radiation patterns. A simulation was run by inserting real aircraft data from the North Atlantic Track System into the model and placing the satellite at altitudes of 400, 600, and 800 [*]km.

40|$|To {{compensate}} for sensory processing delays, the visual system must make predictions to ensure timely and appropriate behaviors. Recent work has found predictive {{information about the}} stimulus in neural populations early in vision processing, starting in the retina. However, to utilize this information, cells downstream must in turn {{be able to read}} out the predictive information from the spiking activity of retinal ganglion cells. Here we investigate whether a downstream cell could learn efficient encoding of predictive information in its inputs in the absence of other instructive signals, from the correlations in the inputs themselves. We simulate learning driven by spiking activity recorded in salamander retina. We model a downstream cell as a binary neuron receiving a small group of weighted inputs and quantify the predictive information between activity in the binary neuron and future input. Input weights change according to spike timing-dependent learning rules during a training period. We characterize the readouts learned under spike timing-dependent learning rules, finding that although the fixed points of learning dynamics are not associated with absolute optimal readouts, they convey nearly all the information conveyed by the optimal readout. Moreover, we find that learned perceptrons <b>transmit</b> <b>position</b> and velocity information of a moving bar stimulus nearly as efficiently as optimal perceptrons. We conclude that predictive information is, in principle, readable from the perspective of downstream neurons in the absence of other inputs, and consequently suggests that bottom-up prediction may {{play an important role in}} sensory processing.

40|$|AbstractModern {{industrial}} environments with automated production machinery {{often require}} special indoor positioning and localization techniques, {{due to the}} presence of objects and of the infrastructure that may obstruct the line-of-sight propagation or interfere with the behaviour of electromagnetic waves. These challenges are difficult to overcome by the widely employed GNSS positioning system designed for use in outdoor areas. One of existing indoor positioning systems are the pseudolites, which <b>transmit</b> <b>positioning</b> signals similar to the ones used by GNSS systems. One of the sources of errors for pseudolites is the multipath propagation. Our paper compares the performances of several multipath propagation detection techniques, using Binary Offset Carrier (BOC) navigation signal and determines that errors increases sharply when the receiver uses navigation signals that have multipath propagation. The techniques that we present improve the positioning accuracy, which leads to more precise industrial processes...|$|R
