On the one hand, successful FinTech firms may have weakened the banks’ dominant position by improving the quality and efficiency of traditional services; on the other hand, banks have taken actions to respond to these challenges, possibly by acquiring FinTech start-ups or setting up their own FinTech affiliates. Third, FinTechs could have established a new channel to distribute financial services, as start-ups and incumbents might have different customer bases. If this is the case, direct competition may remain low, which makes it difficult to observe a clear relationship.|$|R

This paper evaluates evidence for shoreline changes and their causative factors using a case study {{on the east coast}} of South Africa. Beach morphology trends were found to be location-specific, but overall the beaches show a receding trend. It was hypothesized that wave, tide, sea level and wind trends as well as anthropogenic influences are causative factors, and their contributions to shoreline changes were evaluated. Maximum significant wave heights, average wave direction, peak period and storm event frequencies all show weak increasing trends, but only the increases in peak period and wave direction are statistically significant. The chronic beach erosion cannot be attributed to wave climate changes since <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> too <b>small</b> to explain the observations. Instead, the impacts of sea level rise and reductions in the supply of beach sediments are suggested as the main causative factors. The analysis also identifies a trend in the frequency of severe erosion events due to storms that coincide with a 4. 5 -yr extreme tide cycle, which demonstrates the potential impact of future sea level rise...|$|R
30|$|The current {{regime of}} large, high-intensity fire is thus understandably {{the focus of}} Canadian forest fire {{researchers}} and managers. The prevailing “large fire, biophysical paradigm” centers attention on lightning strikes that currently ignite {{the majority of these}} burns (e.g., Nash and Johnson 1996), the weather, fuel and topographic factors that favor fire growth (e. g., Stocks et al. 2004), and rapid initial attack through technology (lightning detection, use of aircraft, etc.) {{that can be used to}} suppress these fires while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>small</b> (e.g., Martell and Sun 2008).

From our experience, contemporary researchers and managers working on the basis of the biophysical paradigm tend to conceptualize that lightning ignitions have long burned the majority of the area in many Canadian ecozones (for argument, say > 75 %), and for various reasons do not believe that human ignitions could have substantially contributed to historic fire regimes in most areas (e.g., Johnson et al. 1998, Bergeron et al. 2004 a).|$|R

Here, we developed a new tool based on collective excitation of plasmonic nanoantenna arrays and demonstrated direct detection of vibrational signatures of single protein monolayers.

The tailored nanoantennas are then arranged {{in such a way that}} their in-phase dipolar coupling leads to a collective excitation of the ensemble with strongly enhanced near fields. The combined collective and individual plasmonic responses of the antenna array play a critical role in attaining signal enhancement factors of 104 – 105. We achieved measurement of the vibrational spectra of proteins at zeptomole levels for the entire array, corresponding to only 145 molecules per antenna. The near-field nature of the plasmonic enhancement of the absorption signals is demonstrated with progressive loading of the nanoantennas with varying protein film thicknesses. Finally, an advanced model based on nonequilibrium Green's function formalism is introduced, which explains the observed Fano-type absorption line-shapes and tuning of the absorption strengths with the antenna resonance...|$|R

But while their visibility has increased, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> a <b>small</b> minority, and they remain disliked, distrusted, and not truly American {{in the eyes of}} many. As a result, many nonbelievers are hesitant about disclosing their views, and those who do often face hostility and discrimination. This Article argues that government religious speech such as 2 ̆ 2 In God We Trust 2 ̆ 2 or a Latin cross war memorial violates the Establishment Clause in part because it exacerbates the precarious position of nonbelievers in this country. One of the main goals of the Establishment Clause is to protect religious minorities like nonbelievers. Contrary to claims that government religious speech is essentially harmless and that any offense it causes should not be considered of constitutional dimension, government religious speech harms both the equality and liberty of nonbelievers. It undermines the equality of nonbelievers by sending the message that they are not worthy of equal regard and by reinforcing stereotypes-in particular, that atheists are immoral and unpatriotic-which leads to discrimination against them. The perpetuation of these stereotypes also undermines the liberty of nonbelievers by making them less willing, or even afraid, to follow the dictates of their conscience. In short, the claim that government religious speech does not violate the Establishment Clause because it only offends nonbelievers misunderstands exactly what is at stake...|$|R

Results: The mean volume of the 145 undescended testes among 118  boys was 0. 238  mL. The volume of the undescended testes <b>was</b> significantly <b>smaller</b> (p <  0. 001) than the mean normative value of 0. 418  mL. The volume of postorchiopexy undescended testes (0. 356  mL) revealed a growing trend in the mean 2. 5 -year follow-up with a significance increase of size (p =  0. 001), but has not yet reached the normal testicular size (0. 604  mL). Conclusion: The preorchiopexy volumes of undescended testes <b>are</b> significantly <b>smaller</b> than normative values. The follow-up postorchiopexy volumes of undescended testes actually increased in size, although <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>smaller</b> than normative values. These Taiwanese testicular growth curves should become reference values in pediatric clinical practice when evaluating testicular development.

40|$|Through {{the use of}} an {{automatic}} photo tube dew-point hygrometer, the author succeeded in measuring dew point of gas flows continuously in anesthetic circuits. Simultaneous thermometries were done on the nasal or oral mucosa, on the respiratory gas flows in the anesthetic mask or the endotracheal tube, and on the gas in the inhaling conduit. Experiments were performed on ten adults patients undergoing various types of surgery under general inhalation anesthesia. Anesthetic technics were varied intentionally during the measurements. Thus, both absolute and relative humidities of exhaled and inhaled gases, and respiratory water and heat losses were calculated under various anesthetic conditions, and physiological and clinical considerations were discussed. The conclusions obtained from this research are as follows: (1) When a non-rebreathing system is applied, moisture content of exhaled gas is minimal, and respiratory losses of both water and heat are maximum. With a semi-closed circle method, according to decreasing fresh gas flows, the humidity of the inspiratory and expiratory gases becomes higher, and both heat and water losses through respiration are lessened. When a closed circle method, with carbon dioxide absorption, is employed, temperature and humidity of gas in the inhaling conduit are highest, and the expired gas offers the maximum temperature and moisture contenL Both water and heat losses from anesthesia become minimal when administered in a closed system. (2) While the water and heat that a patient loses through respiration increase with increasing breathing capacity, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>small</b> parts of the total water and heat losses of the patient. Water and heat losses via anesthesia systems are not so predominant in maintaining water balance and heat regulation of patients during anesthesia and surgery. </p...|$|R
