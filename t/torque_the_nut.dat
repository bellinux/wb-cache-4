50|$|Specialized {{locking nuts}} exist {{to prevent this}} problem, but {{sometimes}} it is sufficient to add a second nut. For this technique to be reliable, each nut must be tightened to <b>the</b> correct <b>torque.</b> <b>The</b> inner <b>nut</b> is tightened to about a quarter to a half of <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> of <b>the</b> outer <b>nut.</b> It is then {{held in place by}} a wrench while <b>the</b> outer <b>nut</b> is tightened on top using <b>the</b> full <b>torque.</b> This arrangement causes <b>the</b> two <b>nuts</b> to push on each other, creating a tensile stress in the short section of the bolt that lies between them. Even when the main joint is vibrated, the stress between <b>the</b> two <b>nuts</b> remains constant, thus holding <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> threads in constant contact with the bolt threads and preventing self-loosening. When the joint is assembled correctly, <b>the</b> outer <b>nut</b> bears <b>the</b> full tension of the joint. <b>The</b> inner <b>nut</b> functions merely to add a small additional force to <b>the</b> outer <b>nut</b> and {{does not need to be}} as strong, so a thin nut (also called a jam nut) can be used.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{the details}} of an {{experimental}} method to measure the clamping force value at bolted connections due to application of wrenching <b>torque</b> to tighten <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> have been presented. A simplified bolted joint including a holed plate with a single bolt was considered {{to carry out the}} experiments. This method was designed based on Hooke’s law by measuring compressive axial strain of a steel bush placed between <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> and <b>the</b> plate. In the experimental procedure, the values of clamping force were calculated for seven different levels of applied torque, and this process was repeated three times for each level of <b>the</b> <b>torque.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> effect of lubrication of threads on the clamping value was studied using the same method. In both conditions (dry and lubricated threads), relation between <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> and <b>the</b> clamping force have been displayed in graphs.

40|$|A {{pump system}} of the {{reciprocating}} piston type is described, which facilitates direct motor drive and cylinder sealing. A threaded middle potion of the piston is engaged by a nut connected to rotate with the rotor of an electric motor, {{in a manner that}} minimizes loading on the rotor by the use of a coupling that transmits <b>torque</b> to <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> but permits it to shift axially and radially with respect to <b>the</b> rotor. <b>The</b> <b>nut</b> has a threaded hydrostatic bearing for engaging the threaded piston portion, with an oil-carrying groove in <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> being interrupted. A fluid emitting seal located at the entrance to each cylinder, can serve to center the piston within the cylinder, wash the piston, and to aid in sealing. The piston can have a long stroke to diameter ratio to minimize reciprocations and wear on valves at high pressures. The voltage applied to the motor can be reversed prior to the piston reaching the end of its stroke, to permit pressure on the piston to aid in reversing the motor...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanism}} {{has been}} designed to apply the loads (the stirring and the resection forces and torques) in self-reacted friction stir welding. This mechanism differs somewhat from mechanisms used in conventional friction stir welding, as described below. The tooling needed to apply the large reaction loads in conventional friction stir welding can be complex. Self-reacted friction stir welding has become popular in the solid-state welding community as a means of reducing the complexity of tooling and to reduce costs. The main problems inherent in self-reacted friction stir welding originate in the high stresses encountered by the pin-and-shoulder assembly that produces the weld. The design of the present mechanism solves the problems. The mechanism includes a redesigned pin-and-shoulder assembly. <b>The</b> welding <b>torque</b> is transmitted into the welding pin by a square pin that fits into a square bushing with set-screws. The opposite or back shoulder is held in place by a Woodruff key and high-strength nut on a threaded shaft. The Woodruff key reacts <b>the</b> <b>torque,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> reacts <b>the</b> tensile load on the shaft...|$|R
50|$|Due to the accident, on August 25, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered {{emergency}} {{inspections of}} wing leading-edge slat tracks on all Next Generation Boeing 737 aircraft. The Emergency Airworthiness Directive (EAD) from the FAA requires operators {{to inspect the}} slat track downstop to check for missing parts, ensure proper installation, and check {{the inside of the}} slat can for foreign object debris and damage. The directive requires operators to inspect within 24 days and every 3000 flight cycles thereafter. Following feedback from completed inspections revealing loose parts in several other aircraft and one with a damaged slat can, the FAA issued a new emergency airworthiness directive on August 28. Airlines were then required to perform the inspection on Next Generation Boeing 737 aircraft within 10 days instead of 24 days. In addition, the AD required a one-time <b>torquing</b> of <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> and bolt in the downstop assembly for the slat track within 24 days.|$|R
30|$|The {{very high}} metal ion levels seen in {{reduction}} screw tab washings {{suggest that this}} exposed unoxidized metal surface (at the point where pedicle screw tabs are broken off) might be a more active site of metal ion release. This surface is unpassivated, whereas the unaltered surface of the remaining construct is passivated. This exposed area of unpassivated metal is not dissimilar to the area exposed by <b>the</b> threads and <b>torqued</b> compressions between <b>the</b> rod and the pedicle screws or cross connectors. It appears likely that the maximal exposure of metal ions would occur with exposed unpassivated metal interfaces {{as well as with}} abrading of the anodized surfaces during <b>the</b> <b>torquing</b> of <b>nuts</b> and caps.|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is {{modelling}} polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) locally and on a cell scale. The modelling was done using software based on the finite element method and focused on mass transfer issues and compression pressure distribution {{and its effects on}} local phenomena. Mass transfer, more specifically the flow distribution in the flow field system, was studied on the cathode. The velocity distribution was improved by changing the geometry of the channel system. This improvement was also observed experimentally. Mass transport problems of free-breathing fuel cells were also studied. These cells rely on free convection to provide reactants and remove reaction products. In this thesis, the aim was to develop an accurate model that is also computationally light. The compression distribution in a stack was modelled based on an existing stack design. The results showed poor internal pressure distribution, with most of the cell experiencing insufficient compression. The modelling was then used to find a better end plate structure and suitable <b>torques</b> for <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> and bolt assemblies. The results were validated experimentally. The effect of compression was studied on a local scale on which compression variations caused by the channel structure had been seen to affect the gas diffusion layer properties and contact resistances between components. According to the modelling results, there are strong local transversal electric currents in the cell. This phenomenon can affect the cell performance and lifetime negatively...|$|R

5000|$|The {{design of}} the hub has three main {{elements}} - a splined hub to locate the wheel and two mating cones, one at the inner end which centres the wheel and the other at <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> end. These cones transmit the majority of <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> to <b>the</b> wheel freeing the splines {{of much of the}} load. One of the key features of the Pugh design is that it is self tightening. The wheels {{on the right side of}} the car have a left hand thread on <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> and vice versa.

25|$|In {{both the}} tension and shear joint design cases, some level of tension preload in the bolt and {{resulting}} compression preload in the clamped components {{is essential to the}} joint integrity. The preload target can be achieved by a variety of methods: applying a measured <b>torque</b> to <b>the</b> bolt, measuring bolt extension, heating to expand the bolt then turning <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> down, <b>torquing</b> <b>the</b> bolt to the yield point, testing ultrasonically, or by applying a certain number of degrees of relative rotation of the threaded components. Each method has a range of uncertainties associated with it, some of which are very substantial.|$|R
2500|$|Large-volume users (such as auto makers) {{frequently}} use computer-controlled nut drivers. With such machines, {{the computer}} in effect plots a graph of <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> exerted.

25|$|The preload {{achieved}} by torquing a bolt {{is caused by}} the part of <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> that is effective. Friction in the threads and under <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> or bolt head use up some fraction of <b>the</b> applied <b>torque.</b> Much of <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> applied is lost overcoming friction under <b>the</b> <b>torqued</b> bolt head or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of <b>the</b> applied <b>torque</b> does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head of <b>the</b> bolt or <b>nut</b> (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. <b>The</b> <b>torque</b> value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under <b>the</b> <b>torqued</b> bolt head or <b>nut</b> and <b>the</b> fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|R
40|$|<b>Torque</b> bleeding, <b>the</b> {{unwanted}} loosening of <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> from a bolt connected assembly, is {{a common}} occurrence throughout industry. The phenomenon occurs for various reasons, but it mainly results from improper torque requirements upon fastening due, in part, to the improper characterization of static and dynamic loadings in which the connected assembly is subjected. This project will review <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> bleeding problem for railway crossings and perform several field tests designed to improve {{the performance of the}} bolts in railway crossings...|$|R
2500|$|Typically, a bolt is {{tensioned}} (preloaded) by {{the application}} of a <b>torque</b> to either <b>the</b> bolt head or <b>the</b> <b>nut.</b> <b>The</b> applied <b>torque</b> causes <b>the</b> bolt to [...] "climb" [...] the thread causing a tensioning of the bolt and an equivalent compression in the components being fastened by the bolt. The preload developed in a bolt is due to <b>the</b> applied <b>torque</b> and {{is a function of the}} bolt diameter, the geometry of the threads, and the coefficients of friction that exist in the threads and under <b>the</b> <b>torqued</b> bolt head or <b>nut.</b> <b>The</b> stiffness of the components clamped by the bolt has no relation to the preload that is developed by <b>the</b> <b>torque.</b> <b>The</b> relative stiffness of the bolt and the clamped joint components do, however, determine the fraction of the external tension load that the bolt will carry and that in turn determines preload needed to prevent joint separation and by that means to reduce the range of stress the bolt experiences as the tension load is repeatedly applied. This determines the durability of the bolt when subjected to repeated tension loads. Maintaining a sufficient joint preload also prevents relative slippage of the joint components that would produce fretting wear that could result in a fatigue failure of those parts.|$|R
25|$|Either {{the bolt}} head or <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> can be <b>torqued.</b> If {{one has a}} larger bearing area or {{coefficient}} of friction it will require more <b>torque</b> to provide <b>the</b> same target preload. Fasteners should only be torqued if they are fitted in s.|$|R

50|$|Either {{the bolt}} head or <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> can be <b>torqued.</b> If {{one has a}} larger bearing area or {{coefficient}} of friction it will require more <b>torque</b> to provide <b>the</b> same target preload. Fasteners should only be torqued if they are fitted in clearance holes.|$|R
50|$|Ideally, <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> (or bolts) {{should be}} {{tightened}} with a torque wrench. Lug wrenches {{are much less}} expensive because they lack the ability to measure or limit the force used. Installing a wheel with a lug wrench thus requires a bit of rough guessing about proper tightness. Excessive force can strip threads or make <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> very difficult to remove. Also, uneven <b>torque</b> between <b>the</b> various lug <b>nuts,</b> or excessive torque, can lead to warping of the brake rotor if the car is equipped with disc brakes. For this reason, impact wrenches should properly be used only for removing lug nuts, not for tightening them, although in practice this rule is often ignored for convenience's sake, even by professional mechanics.|$|R
40|$|Screw {{fasteners}} {{are undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} most important machine elements due to their outstanding characteristic to provide a high clamping force just with a simplified design. However, the loosen vibration is their inherent and inevitable fault. The friction locking approach is one of the basic locking fastener categories by enhancing the bearing load on the contact surface of thread by applying a locking force on an antiloosening nut. This locking force may cause more severe deformation in <b>the</b> <b>nut.</b> <b>The</b> contact stress distribution on <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> would be changed and that can cause the variation of <b>the</b> friction <b>torque</b> for <b>the</b> bolt joint. However, there exists no established design calculation procedure that accounts for the rotation deformation and its stiffness of <b>the</b> antiloosening <b>nut</b> under <b>the</b> locking force. The main objective of the work is to develop an analytical solution to the rotation deformation problem encountered in <b>the</b> antiloosening <b>nut.</b> <b>The</b> proposed model is supported by comparison with numerical finite element analysis of different sizes of joint elements and different applied forces...|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} the {{equipment}} for bolting, {{there are two main}} methods for increasing bolt’s prestress (Kang and Wang 2007): one is to increase the bolt-nut tightening torque; the second is to use a bolt tensioning device, which is similar to imposing large prestresses on anchor bolts. The methods for improving bolt-nut tightening torque include: (1) high torque jumbolter. With a high torque jumbolter, it can not only increase <b>the</b> bolt tightening <b>torque,</b> but also achieve an integration of bolt installation to improve installation speed. For instance, <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> of <b>the</b> jumbolter used with continuous miner can reach more than 300  N m. <b>The</b> rated <b>torque</b> of a single jumbolter in China is not greater than 150  N m, and unable to meet the requirement of high tightening <b>torque</b> of <b>the</b> bolt. (2) <b>Torque</b> multiplier. In order to improve <b>the</b> installation <b>torque</b> of <b>the</b> jumbolter, a <b>torque</b> multiplier can be used on the jumbolter to multiply <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> tightening <b>torque</b> when installing bolt. (3) Torque wrench. Using a large torque preload wrench to tighten <b>the</b> bolts and <b>nuts</b> is an effective way to improve the prestress of anchor bolts.|$|R
