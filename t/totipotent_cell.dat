Differentiation of cells is driven by different environmental cues (such as cell-cell interaction) and intrinsic differences (such as those caused by the uneven distribution of molecules during division). Multicellular organisms are composed of cells that fall into two fundamental types: germ cells and somatic cells. During development, somatic cells will become more specialized and form the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. After formation of the three germ layers, cells will continue to specialize until they reach a terminally differentiated state that is much more resistant to changes in cell type than its progenitors.|$|E
50|$|The human {{development}} model is one {{which can be}} used to describe how totipotent cells arise. Human development begins when a sperm fertilizes an egg and the resulting fertilized egg creates a single <b>totipotent</b> <b>cell,</b> a zygote. In the first hours after fertilization, this zygote divides into identical totipotent cells, which can later develop into any of the three germ layers of a human (endoderm, mesoderm, or ectoderm), into cells of the cytotrophoblast layer or syncytiotrophoblast layer of the placenta. After reaching a 16-cell stage, the totipotent cells of the morula differentiate into cells that will eventually become either the blastocyst's Inner cell mass or the outer trophoblasts. Approximately four days after fertilization and after several cycles of cell division, these totipotent cells begin to specialize. The inner cell mass, the source of embryonic stem cells, becomes pluripotent.|$|E

40|$|The {{successful}} implantation of the blastocyst {{depends on}} adequate {{interactions between the}} embryo and the uterus.

This review focuses on the actions of interleukin- 1, leukemia inhibitory factor, epidermal growth factor, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor, and on the network of their interactions leading to early embryo development, peri-implantatory endometrial changes, embryo implantation and trophoblast differentiation.

While the replication of WDV double-stranded DNA forms (replicons) was equivalent between wheat suspension culture cells and embryos, GUS reporter gene activity was 20 - 40 times {{higher in the}} embryo cultures. Maximum expression of WDV replicons occurred in the embryonic axis tissue of wheat embryos but their expression in suspension cells was compromised, compared with transiently maintained input plasmid DNA containing the same sequences.

The term competency is used {{to distinguish between the}} phenomenon described here and control of gene expression by specific transcription factors. Control of competency is independent of Pv, the replacement 35 S promoter and of the complementary sense control of virion sense expression involving specific sequences in Pv.

40|$|In land plants {{comparative}} genomics {{has revealed that}} members of basal lineages share {{a common set of}} transcription factors with the derived flowering plants, despite sharing few homologous structures. The plant hormone auxin has been implicated in many facets of development in both basal and derived lineages of land plants. We functionally characterized the auxin transcriptional response machinery in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, a member of the basal lineage of extant land plants. All components known from flowering plant systems are present in M. polymorpha, but they exist as single orthologs: a single MpTOPLESS (TPL) corepressor, a single MpTRANSPORT inhibitor response 1 auxin receptor, single orthologs of each class of auxin response factor (ARF; MpARF 1, MpARF 2, MpARF 3), and a single negative regulator auxin/indole- 3 -acetic acid (MpIAA). Phylogenetic analyses suggest this simple system is the ancestral condition for land plants. We experimentally demonstrate that these genes act in an auxin response pathway [...] chimeric fusions of the MpTPL corepressor with heterodimerization domains of MpARF 1, MpARF 2, or their negative regulator, MpIAA, generate auxin insensitive plants that lack the capacity to pattern and transition into mature stages of development. Our results indicate auxin mediated transcriptional regulation acts as a facilitator of branching, differentiation and growth, rather than acting to determine or specify tissues during the haploid stage of the M. polymorpha life cycle.

40|$|The {{process by}} which a single <b>totipotent</b> <b>cell</b> becomes a complex {{organism}} is a unidirectional program, with each mitotic division generating new cells that gradually differentiate towards more specified fates and specialized functions. Nuclear transfer (NT) experiments have demonstrated the epigenetic nature of development and showed, that although differentiated cells have a very limited developmental potential, the nuclei of these cells retain the potency to direct embryogenesis after reintroduction into the unfertilized oocyte. Herein, we have used the mouse as a model system for understanding both the nature of epigenetic reprogramming that occurs after NT {{as well as the}} ramifications it has for the development of cloned animals. Specifically, we investigated how epigenetic states are reprogrammed after NT and demonstrated that the inactive X chromosome is reactivated in NT embryos, resulting in normal X inactivation in female clones. Additionally, investigations into the factors that influence the survival of cloned animals, indicate that there are considerable genetic influences on the cloning process. These genetic factors modify the survival of mice cloned from ES cells by influencing the developmental potential of the donor ES cells rather then the reprogramming process itself. This realization has subsequently {{led to the development of}} novel methods for the expedited production of complex mutant mice, which are also described. Finally, we have created cloned embryos by NT from both cortical and mature olfactory sensory neurons to address question of nuclear equivalence in the brain and to investigate whether generation of synaptic diversity or odorant receptor choice, are mediated by genetic as well as epigenetic events. by Kevin C.

40|$|Stem {{cells are}} defined as unspecialized cells capable of {{long-term}} self-renewal and differentiation into specialized cells. Properties and functions of stem cells have been extensively studied {{in the development of}} organisms, cancer, wound healing, and regenerative medicine. In the latter, it has been investigated for tackling complex pathogenic conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases, hematopoietic impairment, and musculoskeletal degeneration. In the development of organism, the single <b>totipotent</b> <b>cell</b> after fertilization divides and specializes into pluripotent cells, such as embryonic stem cells that are necessary for fetal development. The pluripotent cells then further specialize into multipotent cells that commit into lineages with tissue-specific functions. Cells have been successfully identified in or isolated from embryonic, fetal, or adult tissues and demonstrated to have stem cell-like properties in vitro and in vivo. The maintenance, survival and activity of these stem cells is suggested to be dependent on special microenvironmental niche, such that uncommitted pluripotent stem cells can be induced to differentiate to form a particular cell type {{by the nature of the}} environment.

40|$|Transcriptional {{regulation}} of gene expression {{is critical for}} all unicellular and multicellular organisms. The ability to selectively induce or repress expression {{of only a few}} genes from the entire genome gives cells the ability to respond to changing environmental conditions, grow and proliferate. Multicellular organisms begin life as a single <b>totipotent</b> <b>cell,</b> which undergoes many cell divisions during embryonic and later postnatal development. During this process, the dividing cells of the embryo progressively lose their pluripotency and adopt restricted cell fates. Cell fate restriction leads different cell types to gain unique transcriptional profiles. This transcriptional profile or gene expression pattern not only defines the cell types and restricts {{the ways in which they}} can respond to signals, it also has to be faithfully re-established in the progeny of these fate-restricted cells when they divide. Different mechanisms have evolved in multicellular organisms to propagate transcriptional memory of cell identity. Most of mechanisms involve modifications of chromatin such as epigenetic modification of DNA or alterations of associated histones. In contrast to multicellular organisms which have considerable cellular diversity and a long lifespan for which cell fates and transcriptional memory needs to be maintained, single celled budding yeast, Sachharomyces cerevisiae have a life cycle of about 90 minutes in normal nutrient rich conditions. However, even budding yeast have tremendous potential to respond to changing environmental conditions like nutrient availability by inducing expression of various genes. We observed that members of the GAL gene cluster, which encodes genes induced in response to and for metabolizing the sugar galactose, showed heritable transcriptional memory of previous activation. This dissertation thesis describes the studies I have done for my graduate research to define this phenomenon of transcriptional memory at the yeast GAL genes and to determine the mechanism by which it can be formed and inherited. Chapter I gives an introduction to different mechanisms of establishing transcriptional memory in unicellular and multicellular organisms. Chromatin based mechanisms have been well studied in multicellular organisms but not observed in budding yeast. We compare chromatin based or nuclear inheritance with cytoplasmic inheritance that can be observed in yeast. Chapter II describes work done to define the phenomenon of transcriptional memory at GAL 1 gene. We define this as a faster rate of induction of the GAL 1 gene, compared to a naïve gene, after a brief period of repression. We show that this cellular memory persists through mitosis and can be passed on to the next generation. We also show that chromatin remodeling enzymes appear to be required for rapid reinduction, raising the question if yeast may also possess chromatin associated, nuclear mechanisms for cellular memory. Chapter III describes experiments that show that cellular memory observed at GAL 1 is cytoplasmic in nature and also compares our work with similar examples observed recently by other groups. Finally, Chapter IV offers a perspective of the significance of such cellular memory mechanisms in budding yeast and outlines some potential further experiments to better understand the control of GAL 1 induction kinetics...|$|E

A total of 46 unique clones were detected in recipients 5 wk to 7 mo after transplant. Half of these clones (22 of 46) included both lymphoid and myeloid progeny. Eight of the 22 lympho-myeloid clones were represented in multiple recipients, in some cases after injection of limiting numbers of CRU, thus indicating repopulation from sibling <b>totipotent</b> stem <b>cells</b> generated during the initial 4 -wk period in LTC.

40|$|Background: During human {{preimplantation}} development, early blastomeres {{are believed}} to be totipotent. It is likely, however, that blastomeres are allocated to a specific lineage prior to any morphological differentiation. NANOG, SOX 2 and SALL 4 are transcription factors that {{play a key role in}} controlling stemness in embryonic stem cells (ESC) and are therefore candidate markers for developmental triggers in early embryos. KRT 18, a trophoblast-determining gene, may mark early differentiation. Examining the expression pattern of these genes may inform us about when and in which cells totipotency is lost during early human development. Methods: Thirtheen oocytes, 124 preimplantation embryos and 7 human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines were examined for the presence of NANOG, SOX 2, SALL 4 or KRT 18 proteins using immunostaining and confocal microscopy. Results: All stemness markers were expressed in the hESC, but none of them was specific for <b>totipotent</b> <b>cells</b> during human preimplantation development, and none of them seemed to mark cells allocated to the inner cell mass (ICM) or trophectoderm. After lineage specification, only the nuclear expression of NANOG and SOX 2 became restricted to the ICM, at least to some cells because only a subpopulation expressedNANOG. KRT 18 expression was seen for the first time during compaction in some outer cells. KRT 18 was not expressed in hESC. Conclusion: We conclude that the protein expression patterns of markers that define stemness in ESC do not identify the <b>totipotent</b> <b>cells</b> in human preimplantation embryos.
