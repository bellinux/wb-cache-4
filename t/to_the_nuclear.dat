5|$|An {{operation}} {{to expose the}} Erdman Gang leads to the recruitment of Southern, a British Secret Service agent, who is assigned to infiltrate the organisation and leak intelligence on its latest scheme. The gang leader contacts the undercover Southern and Erdman operatives Dempsey and Kenyon at Glen Carrick Castle in the Scottish Highlands, and briefs them on their mission. The trio are to drive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nuclear</b> Plutonium Store, where isotopes for all Britain's power stations are housed, and plant explosives to detonate at 12:30p.m.; this will cause a nuclear explosion of unprecedented scale and devastate half of England. To ensure compliance, the charges, which have already been armed, are contained in wrist bracelets identical to Prescott's and are to be unlocked on retrieval of the key at the Plutonium Store.|$|E

After Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany in 1933, Szilard urged his family and friends to flee Europe while they still could. He moved to England, where he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs. While in England he discovered a means of isotope separation known as the Szilard–Chalmers effect.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, India has {{increased}} its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union. In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not party <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nuclear</b> Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state. India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E

Modern battleships were the crucial element of naval power in spite of their price. Each battleship was a signal of national power and prestige, in a manner similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons of today. Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Japan and Austria all began dreadnought programmes, and second-rank powers including the Ottoman Empire, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.|$|E

5|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) is a membranous synthesis and transport organelle {{that is an}} extension of the nuclear envelope. More than half the total membrane in eukaryotic cells is accounted for by the ER. The ER is made up of flattened sacs and branching tubules that are thought to interconnect, so that the ER membrane forms a continuous sheet enclosing a single internal space. This highly convoluted space is called the ER lumen and is also referred to as the ER cisternal space. The lumen takes up about ten percent of the entire cell volume. The {{endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane allows molecules to be selectively transferred between the lumen and the cytoplasm, and since it is connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> envelope, it provides a channel between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.|$|E
5|$|Two {{shipboard}} accidents {{occurred during}} Tritons post-launch fitting-out. On 2 October 1958, prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> reactor fuel being installed, a steam valve failed during testing, causing a large cloud of steam {{that filled the}} number two reactor compartment, and on 7 April 1959, a fire broke out during the testing of a deep-fat fryer and spread from the galley into the ventilation lines of the crew's mess. Both incidents, neither nuclear related, were quickly handled by ship personnel, with Lt. Commander Leslie B. Kelly, the prospective chief engineering officer, being awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his quick action during the incident on 2 October.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>nuclear</b> {{power is}} <b>the</b> clear energy and <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> power plant {{is the good}} power plant project, but someone {{disagree}} the project for the environment impact from <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> radioactivity. This paper compares the different opinions about <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> power project and analyzes the existing problems. The advantages of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> power plant are the abundant raw material uranium, the light environment pollution, the low operation cost and the environment radioactivity risk. The disadvantages of the project are the public fear from <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> risk, <b>the</b> difficult <b>to</b> dispose <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> waste, and <b>the</b> difficult <b>to</b> dismantle <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> power plant. My opinion is <b>to</b> develop <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> power plant in places with poor energy resource, and develop the hydroelectric power plant in places with rich water resource, and develop the wind power plant in places with rich wind resource, and develop the heat power plant in places with rich coal, oil, natural gas or other fossil fuel resources...|$|R
5|$|While {{assigned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> delivery role, the Victor {{was finished}} in an all-over anti-flash white colour scheme, {{designed to protect}} the aircraft against the damaging effects of a nuclear detonation. The white colour scheme was intended to reflect heat away from the aircraft; paler variations of RAF's roundels were also applied for this same reason. When the V-bombers were assigned to the low-level approach profile in the 1960s, the Victors were soon repainted in green/grey tactical camouflage to reduce visibility to ground observation; the same scheme was applied to subsequently converted tanker aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Promyelocytic leukaemia bodies (PML bodies) are spherical bodies found {{scattered}} throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.1–1.0 µm. They are known {{by a number of}} other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. PML bodies are named after one of their major components, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. PML bodies belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> matrix, an ill-defined super-structure of the nucleus proposed to anchor and regulate many nuclear functions, including DNA replication, transcription, or epigenetic silencing. The PML protein is the key organizer of these domains that recruits an ever-growing number of proteins, whose only common known feature to date is their ability to be SUMOylated. Yet, pml-/- mice (which have their PML gene deleted) cannot assemble nuclear bodies, develop normally and live well, demonstrating that PML bodies are dispensable for most basic biological functions.|$|E
