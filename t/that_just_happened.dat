25|$|An {{important}} {{concept in}} understanding these results {{is that of}} transitional probability, the likelihood of an element, {{in this case a}} syllable, following or preceding another element. In this experiment, syllables that went together in words had a much higher transitional probability than did syllables at word boundaries <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> to be adjacent. Incredibly, infants, after a short two-minute presentation, were able to keep track of these statistics and recognize high probability words. Further research has since replicated these results with natural languages unfamiliar to infants, indicating that learning infants also keep track of the direction (forward or backward) of the transitional probabilities. Though the neural processes behind this phenomenon remain largely unknown, recent research reports increased activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus during the detection of word boundaries.|$|E

He added that the team did not want to make a violent series but an [...] "artistic series <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> to have some violence included in it". About the amount of violence, Shiotani told Urobuchi, [...] "just let us deal with it". Some of these violent scenes occur off-camera, but whenever a protagonist was involved the moment was developed to be memorable. The team twice had to remake scenes because the television station complained that they went [...] "overboard." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{described}} above, {{there are}} arguments about whether {{these and other}} early bands truly qualify as [...] "heavy metal" [...] or simply as [...] "hard rock". Those closer to the music's blues roots or placing greater emphasis on melody are now commonly ascribed the latter label. AC/DC, which debuted with High Voltage in 1975, is a prime example. The 1983 Rolling Stone encyclopedia entry begins, [...] "Australian heavy-metal band AC/DC". Rock historian Clinton Walker writes, [...] "Calling AC/DC a heavy metal band in the seventies was as inaccurate as it is today.... were a rock 'n' roll band <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> to be heavy enough for metal". The issue is not only one of shifting definitions, but also a persistent distinction between musical style and audience identification: Ian Christe describes how the band [...] "became the stepping-stone that led huge numbers of hard rock fans into heavy metal perdition".|$|E
500|$|Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery also awarded it five stars, {{though he}} felt Amy and Rory's breakup was [...] "a little {{difficult}} to buy" [...] {{as it was}} resolved quickly, even if the situation was [...] "sensitively handled" [...] and [...] "deftly performed". Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club graded [...] "Asylum of the Daleks" [...] as a [...] "B+", also writing {{that he had a}} [...] "quibble" [...] with the Ponds' marriage issue as it had not been foreshadowed, but ultimately felt that the episode [...] "gets the season off to a great start while creating a sense that anything could happen". IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode as 8.5 out of 10, finding that the [...] "only downside" [...] was that [...] "it felt less a tale about the Daleks than an adventure <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> to have them in it". Maureen Ryan, writing for The Huffington Post, felt it was a [...] "ripping start to the season" [...] that redeemed the Daleks from [...] "Victory of the Daleks". While she commended Gillan and Darvill's acting during Amy and Rory's emotional confrontation, she noted that they were not a couple that would break up because of infertility.|$|E
500|$|Bullen {{wanted the}} episode {{to be an}} {{ordinary}} episode of Cold Feet <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> to be set in Australia. The original script included stereotypical references to Australian culture, such as [...] "prawns on the barbie", but these were cut to avoid turning the episode into a travelogue. Bullen told the Sun Herald, [...] "I really wanted to go beyond 'no worries' and 'she'll be right mate'. We've asked most of the local actors to improvise with their own sayings, {{to make sure we}} get it right." [...] In 2003, Bullen recalled this episode's script as the most difficult he had ever written. The collapse of Karen and David's marriage was a controversial issue among the writer and producers; two characters had already divorced and Harries wanted to avoid all three of the main relationships failing. After enjoying the quality of the Australian guest stars, Bullen joked to the Sun Herald that he would write a spin-off series featuring Gary Sweet. Eventually, no spin-off series were created. This episode was produced as the final episode of Cold Feet; Mike Bullen did not believe he could continue writing another series and cast members were eager to take other roles. During production in Australia, Bullen's interest in the series was renewed, and he decided he would like to write a final run of episodes.|$|E

500|$|After various failed relationships, Lex finally {{believes}} he has what he wants when he begins a romantic relationship with Lana Lang. In [...] "Hypnotic", {{in an effort to}} stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drives Lana into Lex's arms. Writer Darren Swimmer explains that this was not something <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> in the series, but something that had been hinted at for many seasons. Rosenbaum admits that Lex had a crush on Lana for many years, but contends that he tried to help Clark win Lana early on—he succeeded. When Clark and Lana's relationship crumbled, because of Clark's deceit, Lex was waiting. Rosenbaum believes that Lana was [...] "tired of the boy and wanted a man around". By contrast, Swimmer believes that Lana started dating Lex as a way of making Clark mad, but the relationship [...] "turned into much more". Kreuk contends that Lana went to Lex because [...] "she knows she will never really love him." [...] Kreuk believes that Lana's relationship with the men in her life was originally motivated by a desire to fill a void in her life that was left after her parents were killed. This need to fill that emptiness was fulfilled in [...] "Void", when Lana took a drug to induce death so that she could see her parents in the afterlife. Upon meeting her parents, Kreuk believes that Lana realized that she no longer needed someone else to fill that hole in her. Kreuk sees this filled void as the reason why Lana would gravitate toward Lex. Kreuk feels that if Lex had chosen a different path after the events of [...] "Lexmas", then Lana {{would have been able to}} truly love him.|$|E

The return of Clark's powers in [...] "Hidden", {{as well as the}} secrets and lies that accompany them, caused stress on their relationship. In the series' 100th episode, Clark finally took a chance and told Lana the truth. When it resulted, indirectly, in her death and he was allowed to live the day over again Clark chose not to tell her his secret. In [...] "Hypnotic", in an effort to stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drove Lana into Lex's arms.

2500|$|To {{illustrate}} the theory, Stephen Mumford gives {{the example of}} all ravens are black. Under the theory of Armstrong, Tooley and Dretske, there is a relation of necessity between the universals ravenhood and blackness, rather than there being a relationship with every single raven. This allows the explanation of laws of nature {{that have not been}} instantiated. Mumford cites the frequently-used example of the moa bird: [...] "It is supposed that every bird of this now-extinct species died at a young age, though not because of anything in its genetic makeup. Rather, it died mainly because of some virus <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> to sweep through the population. One bird could have escaped the virus only to be eaten by a predator on the day before its fiftieth birthday."

2500|$|The fleet {{was ordered}} by the British Transport Commission as direct {{comparison}} with British Rail Class 40, and were not actually wanted by the Western Region, who preferred their production fleet of D800 Warships. [...] The D600s {{were the result of}} power politics within the BTC and the WR: the former was unwilling to sanction radical, stressed-skin lightweight construction locomotives at the time, while the latter was equally insistent {{that at least some of}} the new Type 4 power range locomotives on order be equipped with hydraulic transmission. [...] They were much heavier than production Warships (almost [...] compared to [...] ) and can be regarded as standard 1950s British design diesel locomotives <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> to contain two lightweight, high-revving diesel engines coupled to hydraulic transmissions rather than one large, slow-revving diesel engine and electrical generator set. [...] For this reason they were practically obsolete in design terms before they had left the drawing board.|$|E
2500|$|The Fiero {{turned out}} to be an unusual design for GM, one which stood out from the rest of their product lines. The company had {{rejected}} development of a sporty, two-seater Pontiac since the late 1960s, as they believed it would steal sales from the Corvette. However, young Pontiac engineers in 1978 were able to sell the Fiero concept to the corporation as a fuel-efficient four-cylinder [...] "commuter car" [...] <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> to have two seats, rather than a muscle car. When the engineers brought back a running prototype in less than six months, corporate bought it. However, the budget for the car, from design to building the machines for making the parts, was 400 million dollars, just a fraction of what GM generally spent on bringing a typical prototype car into production. Pontiac assigned oversight of the Fiero to Hulki Aldikacti, a Turkish immigrant with a master's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan and an MBA from Michigan State University along with nearly 22 years of experience.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 August 2008, George Friedman, US {{military}} analyst, and a CEO of a US-based think-tank Stratfor, {{wrote in}} the institution's report: [...] "There had {{been a great deal}} of shelling by the South Ossetians of Georgian villages for the previous three nights, but while possibly more intense than usual, artillery exchanges were routine. [...] It is very difficult to imagine that the Georgians launched their attack against U.S. wishes. The Georgians rely on the United States, and they were in no position to defy it. [...] the United States either was unaware of the existence of Russian forces, or knew of the Russian forces but -- along with the Georgians -- miscalculated Russia's intentions. [...] Putin did not want to re-establish the Soviet Union, but he did want to re-establish the Russian sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union region. [...] He did not want to confront NATO directly, but he did want to confront and defeat a power that was closely aligned with the United States, had U.S. support, aid and advisers and was widely seen as being under American protection. Georgia was the perfect choice. [...] The war in Georgia, therefore, is Russia's public return to great power status. This is not something <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> — it has been unfolding ever since Putin took power, and with growing intensity in the past five years." ...|$|E

5000|$|Contemporary {{critics of}} the film have noted a homoerotic subtext between the film's two central male characters.

5000|$|In 1986, the Seventh Circuit observed: Some {{people believe}} with great fervor preposterous things <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> to {{coincide}} with their self-interest. “Tax protesters” have convinced themselves that wages are not income, that only gold is money, that the Sixteenth Amendment is unconstitutional, and so on. These beliefs all lead—so tax protesters think—to the elimination of their obligation to pay taxes.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{criticism}} of the measuring system itself is that it fails the most important criterion of a sample: it is not random in the statistical sense of the word. A {{small fraction of the}} population is selected and only those that actually accept are used as the sample size. In many local areas during the 1990s, the difference between a rating that kept a show on the air and one that would cancel it was so small as to be statistically insignificant, and yet the show <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> to get the higher rating would survive. In addition, the Nielsen ratings encouraged a strong push for demographic measurements. This caused problems with households that had multiple television sets or households where viewers would enter the simpler codes (usually their child's) raising serious questions {{to the quality of the}} demographic data. The situation further deteriorated as the popularity of cable television expanded the number of viewable networks to the point that the margin of error has increased, because the sampling sizes are too small. Compounding matters is the fact that of the sample data that is collected, advertisers will not pay for time shifted programs (those that are recorded for replay at a different time), rendering the [...] "raw" [...] numbers useless from a statistical point of view. Even in 2013, it was noted that Internet streams of television programs were still not counted because they had either no ads (such as Netflix) or totally different advertising (such as Hulu) than their television counterparts, effectively skewing the raw data on how popular a show really is.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Opportunistic {{activity}} and context recognition systems {{draw from the}} characteristic to use sensing devices <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> to be available rather than pre-defining a fixed sensor infrastructure at design time. Opportunistic sensing offers the possibility to obtain data from sensors <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>happen</b> to {{be available in the}} area surrounding the user. This enables users or applications to state recognition goals, saying what has to be sensed for, at runtime to the system. The available sensing devices that can contribute to the recognition goal are configured to an ensemble, which is the best set of sensors to recognize the goal. This paper describes the OPPORTUNITY Framework and shows its functionality with respect to four application cases (goal querying and sensor configuration, sensor appears/disappears, sensor learns from other sensor and sensor self trust) to show the dynamic nature of an opportunistic system as the available sensing infrastructure is not fixed and changes during runtime. ...|$|R
