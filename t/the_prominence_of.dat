5|$|Nevertheless, Antillean {{music can}} be {{characterized}} by <b>the</b> <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> the Carnival celebration (prominently from Trinidad and Tobago), {{and the importance of}} calypso-like song traditions. The Lesser Antilles is also home to a strong Indo-Caribbean population; though Indo-Caribbean music is found elsewhere in the Caribbean, <b>the</b> <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> Indian-influenced styles is a hallmark of the Antillean music scenes. Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in New York City, where Brooklyn's Labor Day Carnival features music and parades, mas and steel bands; this Carnival is distinct to New York, and reflects elements of a pan-Caribbean nature.|$|E

5|$|For a long time, {{bivalves}} {{were thought}} to be better adapted to aquatic life than brachiopods were, outcompeting and relegating them to minor niches in later ages. These two taxa appeared in textbooks as an example of replacement by competition. Evidence given for this included the fact that bivalves needed less food to subsist because of their energetically efficient ligament-muscle system for opening and closing valves. All this has been broadly disproven, though; rather, <b>the</b> <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> modern bivalves over brachiopods seems due to chance disparities in their response to extinction events.|$|E

50|$|Hierarchical {{patterns}} <b>of</b> <b>prominence</b> {{like those}} represented in metrical trees can {{also apply to}} rhythm in music. <b>The</b> <b>prominence</b> level <b>of</b> a note is determined by <b>the</b> relative <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> nodes above it. The timing of notes also depends on the metrical tree for a particular tune. Each node at the bottom level of the tree (terminal nodes) receives a beat. Empty terminal nodes correspond to rests or form part of a note that spans several beats. Syncopation in music can result when relatively strong nodes are empty.|$|R

5|$|Women's {{suffrage}} in Wales {{has historically}} been marginalised due to <b>the</b> <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> societies and political groups in England which led the reform for women throughout the United Kingdom.

Nevertheless, distinct Welsh groups and individuals rose to prominence and were vocal in the rise of suffrage in Wales and the rest of Great Britain.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} {{the role that}} linguistic and cognitive <b>prominence</b> play in <b>the</b> resolution of anaphor–antecedent relationships. In two experiments, we found that pronouns are immediately sensitive to <b>the</b> cognitive <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> potential antecedents when other antecedent selection cues are uninformative. In experiment 1, results suggest that despite their theoret-ical dissimilarities, topic and contrastive focus both serve to enhance cognitive prominence. Results from experi-ment 2 suggest that the contrastive prosody appropriate for focus constructions may also {{play an important role}} in enhancing cognitive prominence. Thus different types <b>of</b> linguistic <b>prominence</b> (topic, contrastive focus) ap-pear to have the common effect <b>of</b> increasing <b>the</b> cog-nitive <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discourse referent. For pronouns with two possible antecedents, <b>the</b> cognitive <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> an antecedent aids in anaphor resolution, immediately biasing selection towards the more promi-nent (and ultimately preferred) antecedent...|$|R

5|$|In Brazil, the Bororo people {{incorporate}} {{the stars of}} Auriga into a massive constellation representing a caiman; its southern stars represent {{the end of the}} animal's tail. The eastern portion of Taurus is the rest of the tail, while Orion is its body and Lepus is the head. This constellation arose because of <b>the</b> <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> caymans in daily Amazonian life. There is evidence that Capella was significant to the Aztec people, as the Late Classic site Monte Albán has a marker for the star's heliacal rising. Indigenous peoples of California and Nevada also noticed the bright pattern of Auriga's stars. To them, the constellation's bright stars formed a curve that was represented in crescent-shaped petroglyphs. The indigenous Pawnee of North America recognized a constellation with the same major stars as modern Auriga: Alpha, Beta, Gamma (Beta Tauri), Theta, and Iota Aurigae.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, thyroid cancer {{presents}} as a painless {{mass in the}} neck. It is {{very unusual}} for thyroid cancers to present with other symptoms, although in some cases cancer may cause hyperthyroidism. Most malignant thyroid cancers are papillary, followed by follicular, medullary, and thyroid lymphoma. Because of <b>the</b> <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> the thyroid gland, cancer is often detected earlier {{in the course of}} disease as the cause of a nodule, which may undergo fine needle aspiration. Thyroid function tests will help reveal whether the nodule produces excess thyroid hormones. A radioactive iodine uptake test can help reveal the activity and location of the cancer and metastases.|$|E
5|$|In the {{tradition}} of sixteenth-century royal festivals, Catherine de' Medici's magnificences took place over several days, with a different entertainment each day. Often individual nobles or {{members of the royal}} family were responsible for preparing one particular entertainment. Spectators and participants, including those involved in martial sports, would dress up in costumes representing mythological or romantic themes. Catherine gradually introduced changes to {{the tradition}}al form of these entertainments. She forbade heavy tilting of the sort that led to the death of her husband in 1559; and she developed and increased <b>the</b> <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. As a result, the ballets de cour, a distinctive new art form, emerged from the creative advances in court entertainment devised by Catherine de' Medici.|$|E

5|$|Money is {{important}} throughout the film. Concerns about money dominate {{much of the}} film—for example, a large portion is devoted to Wei and her students' attempt to earn enough money for bus tickets—as well as motivating them. Most major characters, including Wei, demand payment for their actions, and it is left unclear whether Wei's search for Zhang Huike is motivated by altruism or {{by the promise of}} a 10-yuan bonus. Zhu Ying points out <b>the</b> <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> money in the film creates a conflict between traditional Confucian values (such as the implication that the solutions to Wei's problems can be found through the help of authority figures) and modern, capitalist and individualistic society.|$|E
5|$|The 1500m and mile run {{events have}} {{historically}} been {{some of the most}} prestigious track and field events. Swedish rivals Gunder Hägg and Arne Andersson broke each other's 1500m and mile world records {{on a number of occasions}} in the 1940s. <b>The</b> <b>prominence</b> <b>of</b> the distances were maintained by Roger Bannister, who (in 1954) was the first to run the long-elusive four-minute mile, and Jim Ryun's exploits served to popularise interval training. Races between British rivals Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram characterised middle-distance running in the 1980s. From the 1990s onwards, North Africans such as Noureddine Morceli of Algeria and Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco came to dominate the 1500 and mile events.|$|E
