5|$|By early 1101, Henry's {{new regime}} was {{established}} and functioning, {{but many of}} the Anglo-Norman elite still supported Robert, or would be prepared to switch sides if Henry's elder brother appeared likely to gain power in England. In February, Flambard escaped from the Tower of London and crossed the Channel to Normandy, where he injected fresh direction and energy to Robert's attempts to mobilise an invasion force. By July, Robert had formed an army and a fleet, ready to move against Henry in England. Raising <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>in</b> the conflict, Henry seized Flambard's lands and, with the support of Anselm, Flambard was removed from his position as bishop. Henry held court in April and June, where the nobility renewed their oaths of allegiance to him, but their support still appeared partial and shaky.|$|E

It adds an explanation of how Caesar's soldiers overcame <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>in</b> the Thames – they tied wooden splints filled with sulphur around them, and burned them using Greek fire. It also identifies the standard-bearer of the 10th legion as Valerius Maximus's Scaeva.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{the state}} holding company Corfo sold its {{stakes in the}} three largest water companies—Aguas Andinas, Esval and Esbio—on the stock exchange, {{primarily}} to individual local and foreign shareholders. The sale of the 30% stake in Aguas Andinas alone brought the state revenues of USD 984 million. The sale of <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>in</b> the two other companies brought USD 564 million in revenues. However, the planned sale of shares in a fourth water company, Essal, was suspended because of low prices offered. In 2015, Antofagasta plc, which had won the concession for the local water supply in Antofagasta in 2003, sold its shares to the publicly owned Colombian multi-utility Empresas Públicas de Medellín (EPM)for USD 965 million.|$|E

25|$|Chief {{among the}} Post's {{anonymous}} sources was an individual whom Woodward and Bernstein had nicknamed Deep Throat; 33 years later, in 2005, the informant {{was identified as}} William Mark Felt, Sr., {{deputy director of the}} FBI during that period of the 1970s, something Woodward later confirmed. Felt met secretly with Woodward several times, telling him of Howard Hunt's involvement with the Watergate break-in, and that the White House staff regarded <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>in</b> Watergate extremely high. Felt warned Woodward that the FBI wanted to know where he and other reporters were getting their information, as they were uncovering a wider web of crimes than the FBI first disclosed. All of the secret meetings between Woodward and Felt took place at an underground parking garage somewhere in Rosslyn over a period from June 1972 to January 1973. Prior to resigning from the FBI on June 22, 1973, Felt also anonymously planted leaks about Watergate with Time magazine, the Washington Daily News and other publications.|$|E
25|$|Relations {{continued}} to deteriorate during 1663 and early 1664. Charles faced {{the same problem}} {{that his father had}} faced: financial arrangements that kept hm short of money. Parliament had voted him a seemingly generous grant from the customs and excise duties for life, but his financial needs were greater, and he consequently constantly sought additional sources of income. The chartered companies, like the EIC and the RAC, looked promising in this respect, but their profitability depended on a rather predatory method of doing business that brought them in conflict with (especially) their Dutch competitors, the VOC and the WIC. The EIC was no match for the VOC, but the WIC was in its turn weaker than the RAC. The latter company managed in 1664 to conquer most of the trading posts of the WIC in West Africa, while in the same year an English expedition, outfitted by the Duke of York, Charles' brother, captured the WIC colony of New Netherland. These acts of war happened in peacetime. The English were confident that the Dutch, because of their supposed internal divisions, would not react forcefully. Again this was a miscalculation. De Witt ordered Vice-Admiral De Ruyter, who was at the time cruising in the Mediterranean, to retake the WIC forts (even though the WIC was supposed to handle its own affairs; in a way by involving the Dutch navy, De Witt was therefore raising <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>in</b> the conflict).|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of the}} {{expected}} value originated {{in the middle of}} the 17th century from the study of the so-called problem of points, which seeks to divide <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>in</b> a fair way between two players who have to end their game before it's properly finished. This problem had been debated for centuries, and many conflicting proposals and solutions had been suggested over the years, when it was posed in 1654 to Blaise Pascal by French writer and amateur mathematician Chevalier de Méré. de Méré claimed that this problem couldn't be solved and that it showed just how flawed mathematics was when it came to its application to the real world. Pascal, being a mathematician, was provoked and determined to solve the problem once and for all. He began to discuss the problem in a now famous series of letters to Pierre de Fermat. Soon enough they both independently came up with a solution. They solved the problem in different computational ways but their results were identical because their computations were based on the same fundamental principle. The principle is that the value of a future gain should be directly proportional to the chance of getting it. This principle seemed to have come naturally to both of them. They were very pleased by the fact that they had found essentially the same solution and this in turn made them absolutely convinced they had solved the problem conclusively. However, they did not publish their findings. They only informed a small circle of mutual scientific friends in Paris about it.|$|E

500|$|... "Per Manum" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "good".

Despite this, VanDerWerff noted that the episode [...] "has some issues", largely due to the convoluted nature of the mythology {{at this point in the}} show's run, as well as the fact that Duchovny looked [...] "a little bored" [...] at times. However, he wrote that the episode, along with the subsequent episode [...] "This is Not Happening" [...] was a showcase for Anderson's acting ability, and her performance [...] "knits all of this together". Writing for Television Without Pity, Jessica Morgan rated the episode a [...] "B+", deriding some of the episode's plot points, such as the hospital's locking doors, and questioning the villainy of the antagonistic doctors.|$|E

McNeill was interviewed for the magazine Star Trek Monthly shortly after reading the script for [...] "Twilight" [...] for the first time. He explained that after reading it, he said [...] "Holy crap {{how are we going to}} do that?" [...] He explained that the episode would see the Enterprise destroyed but wasn't yet sure how they were going to film certain sequences such as the roof being blown off the bridge and the crew being sucked out into space.|$|E

2500|$|As {{his critics}} claim, Fleva's {{determination}} did not outlast the [...] "morning dew": Bussche and his Romanian agent, the Slatina revolutionist-turned-Germanophile Bogdan-Pitești, increased <b>the</b> <b>stakes.</b> <b>In</b> October 1915, Fleva {{signed on as}} [...] "Political Director" [...] of Libertatea ("Freedom"). Probably the second Germanophile tribune to be secretly financed by Bogdan-Pitești, {{it was in fact}} edited by the young activist writers Tudor Arghezi and Gala Galaction. This sheet was mainly the voice of left-wing Germanophilia, maintaining that the need to enact social reforms was more pressing than any nationalist casus belli. Although he resigned only a month into his assignment, Fleva still published with Libertatea until Romania declared war on Germany.|$|E
2500|$|The 1998 {{elections}} {{were the first}} to be carried out with a non-partisan National Electoral Council.

The elections also saw [...] "the world's first automated voting system, which featured a single integrated electronic network that was supposed to transmit the results from the polling stations to central headquarters within minutes." [...] Whilst Venezuela had traditionally provided election observers to other Latin American countries, the uncertainty of the new system and the possibility of handover to a non-traditional party raised <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> <b>in</b> terms of demonstrating that the elections would be fair, and Venezuela invited international election observers for the first time.
