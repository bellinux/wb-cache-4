40|$|Abstract:For the {{essential}} requirements of NDE for <b>pressure</b> <b>equipment,</b> this paper compares the Chinese Standard {{with the current}} edition(2007) of ASME Code. Combining the production practice in enterprises in China,it presents some of technical pitfalls and remarks in NDE routine operation. The intention is to provide some opinions for reference about NDE technology {{in connection with the}} international standards. Keywords:Pressure equipment;NDE technology;Radiographic examination;ASME Code;Chinese Standard;Areas of confusion;Remarks Up to now, 260 manufacturing enterprises in China have been certified by ASME and the certified number is increasing at a rate of 11 % each year. The ASME Code is not only the statutory basis for the design and manufacture of <b>pressure</b> <b>equipment</b> in the certified companies, but also the quality guideline for the Chinese products of <b>pressure</b> <b>equipment</b> going towards the world markets. The Chinese Industrial Standard JB 4730 - 2005 NDE of <b>Pressure</b> <b>Equipment,</b> in the term of the four basic NDE methods, has adopted a lot of the important requirements of ASME Code. However, there are still certain differences between the standards of China and America such as in selection of some specific parameters and performance of technological procedures. Some of the practices need to be harmonized internationally. Also, there are some areas of confusion in technique and long-standing mistaken concepts exist in routine inspection. Concerning {{the essential}} requirements of NDE for <b>pressure</b> <b>equipment</b> and combining the practice of production in enterprises in China, the author compared the relative clauses of the current edition(2007) of ASME Code and the Chinese Standard, and discussed those problems worthy of remark in NDE technology in order to link up with the international standards...|$|R
