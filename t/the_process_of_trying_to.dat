Despite ideological {{differences between the}} two regimes, the dominant historiography in both countries since the 1960s has continued to reflect nationalist themes, and this common historical outlook is the basis for talks about Korean unification. In <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> reject Japanese colonial scholarship, Korean nationalist historians have adopted many of its premises. Shin Chaeho's irredentist claims over Manchuria, however, have not made it into the mainstream.|$|E

Moreover, from 1502 to 1503, he witnessed the brutal reality of the state-building methods of Cesare Borgia (1475–1507) and his father, Pope Alexander VI, who were then engaged in <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> bring a large part of Central Italy under their possession. The pretext of defending Church interests was used as a partial justification by the Borgias. Other excursions to the court of Louis XII and the Spanish court influenced his writings such as The Prince.|$|E

2500|$|When {{someone asks}} a person a {{question}} such as [...] "What is your name?", the person automatically knows the answer. However, when someone asks a person a question such as [...] "What {{was the fifth}} dinosaur ever discovered?", the person also automatically knows {{that he or she}} does not know the answer. [...] A person knowing that he or she does not know is another aspect of metamemory that enables people to respond quickly when asked a question that they do not know the answer to. In other words, people are {{aware of the fact that}} they do not know certain information and do not have to go through <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find the answer within their memories, since they know the information in question will never be remembered. One theory as to why this knowledge of not knowing is so rapidly retrieved is consistent with the cue-familiarity hypothesis. The cue familiarity hypothesis states that metamemory judgments are made based on the familiarity of the information presented in the cue. The more familiar the information in the memory cue, the more likely a person will make the judgment that he or she knows that the target information is in memory. With regards to knowing that you don't know, if the memory cue information does not elicit any familiarity, then a person quickly judges that the information is not stored in memory.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fifth}} season, Richard Woolsey replaces Carter {{as the leader}} of the expedition. Teyla, who was held captive by Michael, gives birth to Torren John and escapes with her team, before they are able to cripple Michael. Eventually, he invades Atlantis with a commandeered Puddle Jumper to take Torren and destroy Atlantis but, thanks to the efforts of Sheppard, Teyla, and McKay, Michael is finally killed. The season also {{introduces}} a group of rogue Asgard, who unlike their Ida counterparts, actually experiment on humans to prolong their lives, and steal a device known as [...] "The Attero device" [...] to destroy the Wraith, though the side effect is that any Stargate activated after the device has been turned on will explode. The device is eventually destroyed. With the Attero device, Michael and the Hoffan drug, the Wraith have become weakened, and are no longer the power of the galaxy they once were; this gives the humans of the Pegasus galaxy freedom enough to establish a coalition. McKay falls in love with Keller, who eventually reciprocates his feelings, and they become romantically involved. In the season finale (also the series finale), [...] "Enemy at the Gate", Todd the Wraith alerts Atlantis to the fact that an underling wraith possesses a Hive Ship powered by a ZPM. [...] In <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> retrieve the ZPM and disable the Hive, the Atlantis team is present when the Hive receives a communication sent from an alternate reality giving away Earth's location. [...] The Hive disables both the Daedalus and the Apollo, then heads straight to Earth. With a full set of ZPMs turned over by Todd, the expedition takes the city itself to defend Earth. The Hive ship is then destroyed in the subsequent battle and Atlantis lands in the Pacific Ocean near the Golden Gate Bridge in [...] San Francisco.|$|E

30|$|Fitting {{rooms are}} places where customers’ {{inspection}} for purchase decision-making takes place, and they {{play a vital role}} at fashion retail stores; however, there have not been enough studies done regarding the fitting rooms in the fashion marketing field. Previous studies on fitting rooms in fashion retail stores focused mainly on the physical environment of the fitting room, such as size, color, lighting, and mirrors, as well as consumer’s responses to these elements (Kim and Kim 2015; Song et al. 2013). Baumstarck and Park (2010) identified the effect of fitting room lighting on consumers’ emotional evaluation; Kang (2015)’s study focused on consumers’ psychological experiences in fitting rooms, and reported that distorting the fitting room environment with mirrors and lighting can affect customers’ satisfaction with their self-appearance, thus influencing their purchase behavior. Meanwhile, Moody et al.

40|$|Trials {{against both}} war crimes and treason {{were held in}} the Philippines {{after the end of}} the Japanese {{occupation}} in 1945. In the former, a universalistic category of crimes were punished, while in the latter, the crime was primarily one of betrayal, and its victim was the nation. In January, 1948 a presidential amnesty was proclaimed by Manuel Roxas for all those accused of wartime treason except for military and police collaborators, spies, informers, or those accused of violent crimes. Most of the treason cases not covered by this amnesty were against those guilty of some of the same atrocities being treated as war crimes in trials against the Japanese. This article explores <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> atrocities and sexual violence of mostly military and constabulary collaborators in the postwar Philippines under its law of treason and argues that, if war crimes trials of the early postwar fell short in many ways, punishing the brutality of war as betrayal was a deeply troubled alternative...|$|R

40|$|One big {{difficulty}} in the practical use of support vector machines is {{the selection of}} a suitable kernel function and its appropriate parameter setting for a given application. There is no rule for the selection and people have to estimate the machine’s performance based on a costly multi-trial iteration of training and testing phases. In this paper, we describe a method to reduce the model selection training time for support vector machines. The main idea is, in <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> a series <b>of</b> models, the support vectors in previously trained machines are used to initialize the working set in training a new machine. This initialization helps {{to reduce the number of}} required optimization loops, thus reducing the training time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model selection <b>process.</b> Experimental results on real-life datasets show that the training time for each subsequent machine can be reduced effectively in a variety of situations in <b>the</b> model selection <b>process.</b> <b>The</b> method is applicable to different model search strategies and does not affect the model selection result...|$|R

50|$|Vimy, 1917 — Intended as a {{diversion}} {{to draw attention}} away from French actions farther south, and often serving only as a footnote to the less successful overall Battle of Arras in 1917 waged by the British armies, Vimy was the greatest victory of the war for the Canadian Corps, which by 1917 numbered four divisions.
