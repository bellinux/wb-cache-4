This report, and the growing influence of Plunkett, who {{became a member of}} the Irish Privy Council in 1897, led to the passing in 1899 of an Act establishing the Department of Agriculture and <b>Technical</b> <b>Instruction</b> (DATI) for Ireland, of which the Chief Secretary for Ireland was to be President ex officio.

25|$|The {{financial}} {{problems of the}} College were based upon {{the fact that there}} had been a failure to find a 'local Carnegie' – a business magnate who could finance the University by providing endowments and financing the payment of staff. The passing of the <b>Technical</b> <b>Instruction</b> Act empowered local authorities to level a rate for <b>technical</b> <b>instruction.</b> Bristol was able to apply for a further £2,000 in funds and a further £500 was gained in return for an agreement that free places would be made available to some students. This money was used to build an Engineering block. A few months earlier the Medical School building had been finished and formally incorporated into the College. It was not until 1899 that the College began to receive any kind of state funding, leading one lecturer to joke that the motto of the College should be not Knowledge is power but College is poor; until this time the college was wholly dependent upon the student fees paid for the courses. However, the College was expanded as finances allowed during the 1890s after it had teetered on the edge of bankruptcy several times the decade before.|$|E

60|$|And Magdalen? The {{railroad}} {{had obtained}} authority {{to pass through}} the Goyle, and thus break up her home and shelter.

But there is much difference of opinion as to the best [225] way in which the <b>technical</b> <b>instruction,</b> so generally desired, should be given. Two courses appear to be practicable: the one is the establishment of special technical schools with a systematic and lengthened course of instruction demanding the employment of the whole time of the pupils. The other is the setting afoot of technical classes, especially evening classes, comprising a short series of lessons on some special topic, which may be attended by persons already earning wages in some branch of trade or commerce.|$|E
60|$|Coming now to {{that great}} {{majority}} {{who will not}} choose idleness, I think we may assume that, {{with the help of}} science, and by the elimination of the vast amount of unproductive work involved in internal and international competition, the whole community could be kept in comfort by means of four hours' work a day. It is already being urged by experienced employers that their employes can actually produce as much in a six-hour day as they can when they work eight hours. In a world where there is a much higher level of <b>technical</b> <b>instruction</b> than there is now the same tendency will be accentuated. People will be taught not only, as at present, one trade, or one small portion of a trade, but several trades, so that they can vary their occupation according to the seasons and the fluctuations of demand. Every industry will be self-governing as regards all its internal affairs, and even separate factories will decide for themselves all questions that only concern those who work in them. There will not be capitalist management, as at present, but management by elected representatives, as in politics. Relations between different groups of producers will be settled by the Guild Congress, matters concerning the community as the inhabitants of a certain area will continue to be decided by Parliament, while all disputes between Parliament and the Guild Congress will be decided by a body composed of representatives of both in equal numbers.|$|E

60|$|<b>Technical</b> <b>instruction</b> tempts to {{violence}} (as a short cut) more than liberal education. The sailor in Mr Rudyard Kipling's Captains Courageous, teaching the boy {{the names of}} the ship's tackle with a rope's end, does not disgust us as our schoolmasters do, especially as the boy was a spoiled boy. But an unspoiled boy would not have needed that drastic medicine. Technical training may be as tedious as learning to skate or to play the piano or violin; but it is the price one must pay to achieve certain desirable results or necessary ends. It is a monstrous thing to force a child to learn Latin or Greek or mathematics on the ground that they are an indispensable gymnastic for the mental powers. It would be monstrous even if it were true; for there is no labor that might not be imposed on a child or an adult on the same pretext; but as a glance at the average products of our public school and university education shews that it is not true, it need not trouble us. But {{it is a fact that}} ignorance of Latin and Greek and mathematics closes certain careers to men (I do not mean artificial, unnecessary, noxious careers like those of the commercial schoolmaster). Languages, even dead ones, have their uses; and, as it seems to many of us, mathematics have their uses. They will always be learned by people who want to learn them; and people will always want to learn them as long as they are of any importance in life: indeed the want will survive their importance: superstition is nowhere stronger than in the field of obsolete acquirements. And they will never be learnt fruitfully by people who do not want to learn them either for their own sake or for use in necessary work. There is no harder schoolmaster than experience; and yet experience fails to teach where there is no desire to learn.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Alan Cole's carefully-edited {{translation}} of M. Lefebure's history of Embroidery and Lace {{is one of}} the most fascinating books that has appeared on this delightful subject. M. Lefebure {{is one of the}} administrators of the Musee des Arts Decoratifs at Paris, besides being a lace manufacturer; and his work has not merely an important historical value, but as a handbook of <b>technical</b> <b>instruction</b> it will be found of the greatest service by all needle-women. Indeed, as the translator himself points out, M. Lefebure's book suggests the question whether it is not rather by the needle and the bobbin, than by the brush, the graver or the chisel, that the influence of woman should assert itself in the arts. In Europe, at any rate, woman is sovereign in the domain of art-needle-work, and few men would care to dispute with her the right of using those delicate implements so intimately associated with the dexterity of her nimble and slender fingers; nor is there any reason why the productions of embroidery should not, as Mr. Alan Cole suggests, be placed on the same level with those of painting, engraving and sculpture, though there must always be a great difference between those purely decorative arts that glorify their own material and the more imaginative arts in which the material is, as it were, annihilated, and absorbed into the creation of a new form. In the beautifying of modern houses it certainly must be admitted--indeed, it should be more generally recognised than it is--that rich embroidery on hangings and curtains, portieres, couches and the like, produces a far more decorative and far more artistic effect than can be gained from our somewhat wearisome English practice of covering the walls with pictures and engravings; and the almost complete disappearance of embroidery from dress has robbed modern costume of one of the chief elements of grace and fancy.|$|E
