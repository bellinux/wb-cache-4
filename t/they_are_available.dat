5|$|Customers {{who have}} rooms may leave their room doors open to signal that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>available</b> for sex. An open door {{can also be}} an {{invitation}} for others to watch or join in sexual activity that is already occurring.|$|E
5|$|Its winter range {{includes}} southern Canada {{and stretches}} south through the United States {{to parts of}} Mexico. In winter, {{in the northern part}} of its range, the finch may move nearer to feeders if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>available.</b> In southern ranges, during winter, they remain in areas similar to the fields and flood plains where they live during the summer months.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his life}} Grill kept meticulous notes of his business. Some {{of these are}} in the Gothenburg University library, and most of them, along with Grill's letters and correspondence, {{are now in the}} Godegård Archive in the Nordic Museum. Most of the 7,000 {{documents}} in the archive have been digitized following a request from the Macau Historical Archives in 2003. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>available</b> online, including documentation, letters, cargo lists, provisions for the ships and accounts for the Swedish factory in Canton during Grill's time with the SOIC.|$|E

50|$|In 2010 free worship {{compilation}} CDs <b>were</b> <b>available</b> with {{a purchase}} from the Manna store. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>available</b> for the 20th Parachute Music birthday celebrations.|$|R
5|$|All campsites {{accessible}} only on foot or by horseback are considered backcountry campsites and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>available</b> by permit only, but camping is allowed {{in most of}} these backcountry zones year-round. The National Park Service has a combination of specific sites and zones for backcountry camping with a set carrying capacity of overnight stays per zone to protect the resources from overcrowding. Open fires are not permitted in the backcountry and all food must be stored in an Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee approved bear-resistant container. As of 2012, only four brands of bear-resistant containers had been approved for use in the Grand Teton National Park backcountry. Additionally, hikers may use an approved bear spray to elude aggressive bears.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Hybrid Theory, Linkin Park {{received}} invitations to perform at various rock concerts and tours, including Ozzfest, the Family Values Tour, KROQ-FM's Almost Acoustic Christmas, and the band's self-created tour, Projekt Revolution, which was headlined by Linkin Park and featured other bands such as Cypress Hill and Adema. During this time, Linkin Park reunited with their original bassist, Dave “Phoenix” Farrell. The band kept an online journal on their official website throughout their 2001 and 2002 touring regime, in which each band member made a respective notation. Although the notes are no longer on their website, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>available</b> on fansites. Linkin Park played 324 shows in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Hickok willed her {{personal}} papers to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park, {{part of the}} US National Archives. Her donation was contained in eighteen filing boxes that, according to the provisions of her will, were to be sealed until ten years after her death. In early May 1978, Doris Faber, as part of research for a projected short biography of Eleanor Roosevelt, became perhaps the first person outside the National Archives to open these boxes, and was astounded to discover that they contained 2,336 letters from Roosevelt to Hickok, and 1,024 letters from Hickok to Roosevelt. Most of them dated to the 1930s, but the correspondence continued up to Roosevelt's 1962 death. Hickok's papers remain at the FDR Library and Museum, where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>available</b> to the public.|$|E

50|$|All the {{editions of}} the OJ <b>are</b> <b>available</b> on EUR-Lex, dating back to 1952, when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>available</b> in French, Italian, Dutch and German. <b>They</b> can <b>be</b> easily {{retrieved}} via a search or by browsing.|$|R
50|$|The Kappa had engines fitted transversely, all {{powering}} {{only the}} front wheels. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>available</b> {{with either a}} five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission, unless otherwise indicated.|$|R
5|$|In July, {{the diet}} {{switches}} increasingly to fruit. The protein needed for egg-laying {{and for the}} chicks to grow is replaced by fruit sugar which helps the birds to fatten for migration. Aphids are still taken while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>available,</b> since they often contain sugars from the plant sap on which they feed. Blackcaps eat {{a wide range of}} small fruit, and squeeze out any seeds on a branch before consuming the pulp. This technique makes them an important propagator of mistletoe. The mistle thrush, which also favours that plant, is less beneficial since it tends to crush the seeds. Although any suitable fruit may be eaten, some have seasonal or local importance; elder makes up {{a large proportion of the}} diet of northern birds preparing for migration, and energy-rich olives and lentisc are favoured by blackcaps wintering in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|In the Sahara, 332 {{plant species}} have been {{recorded}} as food plants of the dromedary. These include Aristida pungens, Acacia tortilis, Panicum turgidum, Launaea arborescens and Balanites aegyptiaca. The dromedary eats Acacia, Atriplex and Salsola when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>available.</b> Feral dromedaries in Australia prefer Trichodesma zeylanicum and Euphorbia tannensis. In India, dromedaries are fed with forage plants such as Vigna aconitifolia, V. mungo, Cyamopsis tetragonolaba, Melilotus parviflora, Eruca sativa, Trifolium species and Brassica campestris. Dromedaries keep their mouths open while chewing thorny food. They use their lips to grasp the food and chew each bite 40 to 50 times. Its long eyelashes, eyebrows, lockable nostrils, caudal opening of the prepuce and a relatively small vulva help the camel avoid injuries, especially while feeding. They graze for 8–12 hours per day and ruminate for {{an equal amount of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear weapons {{manufacture}} and other nuclear physics applications {{are a major}} source of artificial lithium fractionation, with the light isotope 6Li being retained by industry and military stockpiles {{to such an extent that}} it has caused slight but measurable change in the 6Li to 7Li ratios in natural sources, such as rivers. This has led to unusual uncertainty in the standardized atomic weight of lithium, since this quantity depends on the natural abundance ratios of these naturally-occurring stable lithium isotopes, as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>available</b> in commercial lithium mineral sources.|$|E
50|$|This set {{features}} 4 reprint cards of Aaron, Mantle, Musial, and Robinson. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>available</b> at the 1991 national baseball card convention. Size: 2.5 × 3.5 in.|$|R
5000|$|Large {{number of}} choultries {{were built in}} the name of Maharaja of Mysore, but people called them [...] "Dewan Purniah's Chatras". <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>available</b> to all travelers.|$|R
50|$|The M939 to M945 were chassis with cabs, {{meant to}} carry {{specialized}} bodies. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>available</b> in long and extra long wheelbases, and {{with or without}} front winches.|$|R
5|$|Springbok are {{primarily}} browsers and may switch to grazing occasionally; they feed on shrubs and young succulents (such as Lampranthus species) before they lignify. They prefer grasses such as Themeda triandra. Springbok can meet their water needs {{from the food}} they eat, {{and are able to}} survive without drinking water through dry season. In extreme cases, they do not drink any water over the course of their lives. Springbok may accomplish this by selecting flowers, seeds, and leaves of shrubs before dawn, when the food items are most succulent. In places such as the Etosha National Park, springbok seek out water bodies where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>available.</b> Springbok gather in the wet season and disperse during the dry season, unlike other African mammals.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic {{diamonds}} {{for use as}} gemstones {{are grown}} by HPHT or CVD methods, and currently represent approximately 2% of the gem-quality diamond market. However, {{there are indications that}} the market share of synthetic jewelry-quality diamonds may grow as advances in technology allows for larger higher-quality synthetic production on a more economic scale. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>available</b> in yellow and blue, {{and to a lesser extent}} colorless (or white). The yellow color comes from nitrogen impurities in the manufacturing process, while the blue color comes from boron. Other colors, such as pink or green, are achievable after synthesis using irradiation. Several companies also offer memorial diamonds grown using cremated remains.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} {{has nine}} or more subspecies which breed {{in different parts}} of its range in temperate Eurasia. This species is found in woodlands of all kinds, but where it overlaps with the short-toed treecreeper in western Europe it {{is more likely to be}} found in coniferous forests or at higher altitudes. It nests in tree crevices or behind bark flakes, and favours introduced giant sequoia as nest sites where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>available.</b> The female typically lays five or six pink-speckled white eggs in the lined nest, but eggs and chicks are vulnerable to attack by woodpeckers and mammals, including squirrels.|$|E

5|$|The device {{incorporates}} a 1.7GHz quad-core Snapdragon 600, an ARMv7 SoC, with 2GB of RAM. The chip provides support for LTE networks where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>available.</b> Most HTC One models come with either 32 or 64 GB of internal, non-expandable storage—unlike the international model, the Chinese and Japanese models include a microSD slot and a removable back cover. Its internal components {{are arranged in}} a pyramid-like layout similar to the HTC Butterfly and HTC Windows Phone 8X with larger components (such as the screen and battery) positioned towards the front and smaller components (such as the motherboard) positioned towards the back. This internal layout also allows the device to have a curved backing.|$|E
5|$|Airports {{generally}} have long, fully lit, hard-surfaced runways, full air traffic control, and navigation and landing aids. They are usually located on urban fringes, support commercial and business operations, and often exclude {{certain types of}} light aircraft. At the more rurally located airfields, the lighter end of aviation, such as microlight and gliding activities, becomes increasingly prevalent, and there are few or no commercial operations other than flying schools. At this level runways are generally shorter, and grass surfaces are increasingly common. Navigation aids are increasingly scarce, being more basic where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>available,</b> and informal ground to air radio communication replaces air traffic control. The smallest airfields {{are too small to}} feature on general purpose Ordnance Survey (OS) maps, and lack basic facilities such as fuel and maintenance. The majority of airstrips are basically single short grass runways with no supporting facilities, although the presence of a hangar is not uncommon at the larger examples. They do not feature on OS maps, and are owned by private clubs or, more commonly, individuals.|$|E
5|$|In Europe the DVD and Blu-ray was {{released}} on November 26, 2010, by Kazé. British distributor Manga Entertainment announced in January 2010 they had licensed Summer Wars for the United Kingdom, and {{was released}} in March 2011. In North America, Funimation released Summer Wars on DVD and Blu-ray on February 15, 2011. The North American DVD and Blu-ray releases included previews, and the interviews with Hosoda, Kamiki, Sakuraba, Fuji, Tanimura and Saitō. The first press copies included art cards. To get out enough copies to meet demand some did not ship with the OZ O-card (cardboard slip-cover), as it required specialty printing that takes longer to produce {{than the rest of}} the product. Funimation offered to send out the O-Card to customers who did not receive one as soon as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>available</b> if they fill out a request form on their official website.|$|E

50|$|In {{the decades}} since its creation, new {{varieties}} of the Slurpee drink have <b>been</b> <b>available</b> as tie-ins to films, television, and other media. The {{following is a}} list of promotional tie-in flavors, along with the dates that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>available.</b>|$|R
50|$|Courses {{were studied}} over two years, taking {{place during the}} third and fourth years (age 13-16) of a pupil's time at {{secondary}} school. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>available</b> {{in a wide range of}} subjects.|$|R
5|$|The red-billed chough breeds {{from three}} years of age, and {{normally}} raises only one brood a year, although the age at first breeding is greater in large populations. A pair exhibits strong mate and site fidelity once a bond is established. The bulky nest is composed of roots and stems of heather, furze or other plants, and is lined with wool or hair; in central Asia, the hair may be taken from live Himalayan tahr. The nest is constructed in a cave or similar fissure in a crag or cliff face. In soft sandstone, the birds themselves excavate holes nearly a metre deep. Old buildings may be used, and in Tibet working monasteries provide sites, as occasionally do modern buildings in Mongolian towns, including Ulaanbaatar. The red-billed chough will utilise other artificial sites, such as quarries and mineshafts for nesting where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>available.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several of C.F.W. Walther's sermons {{have been}} {{preserved}} and translated into English by E. Myers. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>available</b> online.|$|E
