5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} his return from Italy, Etty had a very limited social life. In a <b>typical</b> <b>day</b> he would wake at 7am, paint from around 9 or 10am until 4pm, after which {{he would have a}} meal. Following the meal he would take a walk, and attend life classes between 6 and 8pm. On returning home he would drink two cups of tea, and go to bed at midnight.|$|E
5|$|Beginning at Main Street, U.S.A. Station {{adjacent}} to the Magic Kingdom park's entrance, the trains of the Walt Disney World Railroad travel along its single track in a clockwise direction on its circular route. It takes about 20 minutes for each train to complete a round trip on the WDWRR's main line, and on any given day, either two or three trains run, with two running on a <b>typical</b> <b>day.</b> Each train is operated by an engineer and fireman in the locomotive, {{as well as a}} conductor {{at the rear of the}} train who supervises the passengers.|$|E

5|$|In a <b>typical</b> <b>day,</b> each {{crew member}} divided {{his time between}} {{physical}} exercise, station assembly and maintenance, experiments, communications with ground personnel, personal time, and bio-needs activities (such as rest and eating). The crew's daily schedule usually operated on UTC; for example, a typical morning {{had been scheduled to}} begin with an electronic wake-up tone at about 05:00 UTC. But during the expedition, a more typical wake-up time was actually between 06:00 and 07:00 UTC. The crew's sleep habits were sometimes shifted to accommodate the schedules of visiting shuttles or resupply vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Days {{would be}} {{structured}} so that activities would be planned throughout, with occupational therapy carrying on into evenings and at weekends. A <b>typical</b> <b>day</b> would include breakfast then flower arranging until 10:30, {{followed by an}} hour in the occupation room for therapy. After their work, the patients would go for a walk or join in community singing until 2pm. Between 2pm and 8pm there would be more time in the occupation room, a period of rest and time in the garden. At 8 pm there would be community games and country dancing. Casson believed it was important to keep the therapy room separate {{from the rest of the}} department, as it was specialised knowledge. She also insisted that certain activities, such as knitting, were not used as it was not sufficient distraction from the patient's fantasy system. Some concern existed that patients would not accept being put to work, but of her 100 patients in 1931, only six refused the therapy. A member (and later fellow) of the British Homeopathy Society, Casson also included homeopathic treatments in her programme for the patients.|$|E
5|$|Each {{state was}} allowed to cast a single vote either for or against a {{proposal}} during the debates {{in accordance with the}} majority opinion of the state's delegates. Throughout the Convention, delegates would regularly come and go, with only 30–40 being present on a <b>typical</b> <b>day.</b> Consequently, if a state's delegates were equally divided in their views on a given proposal, or if too few of the state's delegates were in attendance to establish a quorum for the delegation when votes were being cast on a particular proposal, that state's delegation had essentially no effect on the outcome of the vote on the proposal. Thus, for example, after two of New York's three delegates abandoned the Convention in mid July with no intention of returning, New York was left unable to vote on any further proposals at the Convention, although Hamilton would continue to periodically attend and occasionally to speak during the debates.|$|E
50|$|A <b>typical</b> <b>day's</b> {{shooting}} {{begins with}} the crew arriving on the set/location by their call time. Actors usually have their own separate call times. Since set construction, dressing and lighting can take many hours or even days, they are often set up in advance.|$|R

5|$|M-86 {{begins in}} Three Rivers at a {{junction}} with Bus. US131 and M-60. From there the road travels south {{out of town}} on Main Street and across the St. Joseph River. After crossing the river, the highway runs through a residential area of town and turns eastward into rural farm lands. M-86 crosses the Prairie River and follows Burr Oak Street into the community of Centreville. The highway switches to follow Main Street through downtown Centreville; east of downtown, Main Street curves along a bend in the river, and it runs parallel to the river out of town. As part of its support of the state highway system, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks the traffic levels along the roads it maintains. These traffic counts are expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a calculation of the vehicles using a segment of roadway on a <b>typical</b> <b>day</b> of the year. In 2009, MDOT measured 7,642vehicles including 138trucks along M-86 in Centreville, the highest traffic levels along the whole highway. As the highway leaves town, it passes by the north side of Lake Templene, and Sand Lake near Nottawa before meeting M-66.|$|E

The show originally ran from September 21, 1968, through May 20, 1975, and helped introduce police procedures and jargon to the general public in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Five {{trains are}} used during a <b>typical</b> <b>day's</b> operations, each {{consisting}} of a single locomotive, two or three regular coaches and a cab car coach. The extra locomotive and coach are available for backup if needed. Northstar platforms were built long enough to accommodate trains of five coaches, which were used for some weekend trains in the early weeks of service.|$|R

25|$|At {{the time}} of this rebuilding, the railway station was served by 500 trains on a <b>typical</b> <b>day,</b> with 2.75million {{passenger}} journeys a year. Wellington (or City North) became entirely devoted to parcels traffic at this time with the track layout extensively changed. The remaining Midland line trains which previously used City North station were diverted into the City South station, the former LNWR/NER 'New' station, and called simply Leeds from this time.|$|E
25|$|On Thursday, September 12, PA {{engineers}} {{said that}} reported delays for local traffic greatly exceeded any time savings {{for the major}} highway traffic based on reported information for vehicle travel times on Interstate 95 and local traffic counts from that week. In an internal PowerPoint presentation, {{it was estimated that}} the extra daily morning rush hour time, 2,800 vehicle-hours, endured by local traffic on a <b>typical</b> <b>day</b> greatly outweighed time savings, 966 vehicle-hours, for the I-95 traffic.|$|E
25|$|A <b>typical</b> <b>day</b> for 3-82 at Thunder {{involved}} {{anywhere from}} 1 to 2 daytime patrols and 1 to 2 nighttime patrols in its sector.

The main focus in the sector is helping to rebuild the neighborhood and helping the Iraqi Security Forces to take ownership in the areas. They have started two school projects that are approximately $100,000.00 a piece and several others in smaller amounts.|$|E

Although the Harmonites typically wore plain clothing, made {{with their own}} materials by their own tailors, they would wear their fine garments on Sundays and on other special occasions. At Economy, on special occasions and Sundays, women wore silk dresses using fabric of their own manufacture. Clothing varied in color, but often carried the same design.

25|$|Dulles {{is one of}} {{the three}} major {{airports}} in the larger Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area with more than 21 million passengers a year. Dulles has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the Mid-Atlantic outside of the New York metropolitan area, including approximately 90% of the international passenger traffic in the Baltimore-Washington region. On a <b>typical</b> <b>day,</b> more than 60,000 passengers pass through Washington Dulles to and from more than 125 destinations around the world. However, Dulles Airport now ranks behind both Baltimore-Washington International Airport (BWI) and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) in total annual passenger boardings.|$|E
25|$|On a <b>typical</b> <b>day,</b> Dulles averages 1,000 to 1,200 flight operations. Dulles International served 21.6 million {{passengers}} in 2014, a 1.7% decrease over 2013. However, international passenger traffic {{has increased by}} 1.6% to nearly 7.1 million during the same time. Additional international service is commencing service at Washington Dulles. With 45 weekly flights, Dulles is now the third largest United States gateway to the Middle East. Even before the United States economic recession started, international passengers have continued to grow, which prompted the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority to expand the International Arrivals Building to handle 2,400 passengers per hour.|$|E
