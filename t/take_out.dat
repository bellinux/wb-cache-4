Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, motorists are obliged to <b>take</b> <b>out</b> third party liability insurance. This means that victims of car accidents can claim money from the insurer of the driver at fault, even though they {{are not part of the}} original contract. Under the Married Women's Property Act 1882 a husband can <b>take</b> <b>out</b> insurance in his own name, but make it enforceable by his wife and children despite the doctrine of privity.|$|E

5|$|In {{a country}} in which few women may <b>take</b> <b>out</b> loans from large {{commercial}} banks, Grameen has focused on women borrowers; 97% of its members are women. While a World Bank study has concluded that women's access to microcredit empowers them through greater access to resources and control over decision making, some other economists argue that the relationship between microcredit and women-empowerment is less straightforward.|$|E

A 501(c) nonprofit organization was formed in March 2010 to preserve the building, which secured a $50,000 grant from PepsiCo to help <b>take</b> <b>out</b> a $385,000 mortgage.

5|$|The {{core of the}} {{gameplay}} {{is focused}} on stealth-based tactics, which require one to silently <b>take</b> <b>out</b> enemies using silenced weapons or other lethal attacks.

In some stealth based missions, the game will involve various puzzles. Some locations feature low light ambience, which force the player to use their torch despite its drawbacks imposed during stealth missions.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{subjecting}} {{the heavy}} water facility at Vemork to heavy air bombing surfaced, but Tronstad was a staunch opponent {{of such an}} idea, which he saw as too hazardous.

The first attempt to <b>take</b> <b>out</b> the facility, in November 1942, had consisted of British personnel using gliders to land near Vemork. The operation, codenamed Freshman, was a catastrophe, as all units except for one towing aircraft perished, either due to crash landings or in German captivity.|$|E
