5|$|The list of Florida hurricanes from 1900 to 1949 {{encompasses}} 108 Atlantic tropical cyclones {{that affected}} the U.S. state of Florida. Collectively, tropical cyclones in Florida during the <b>time</b> <b>period</b> resulted in about $4billion (2008USD) in damage. Additionally, tropical cyclones in Florida were {{directly responsible for}} about 3,550fatalities during the <b>time</b> <b>period,</b> most of which from the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane. The 1947 season was the year with the most tropical cyclones affecting the state, {{with a total of}} 6systems. The 1905, 1908, 1913, 1927, 1931, 1942, and 1943 seasons were the only years during the <b>time</b> <b>period</b> in which a storm did not affect the Floridian coasts.|$|E

Over time, increasingly shorter <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> have become appropriate in the chronological organization of the arts due to the rate of technological change, modern communications and education, and modern values that favor pluralism and individuality. Century- or decades-based <b>time</b> <b>periods,</b> although arbitrary, avoid difficulties posed by multiple schools of art being active across overlapping <b>time</b> <b>periods.</b> Such arbitrary <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> appear also to serve well for the current time during which the concept of schools of art has weakened...|$|R

Prices for the resource differ between {{at least two of the}} plurality of <b>time</b> <b>periods.</b> Each anticipated demand of the set is associated with a different one of the plurality of <b>time</b> <b>periods.</b> The method further includes setting prices for the resource during each of the plurality of <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> according to the determined set of anticipated demands. The determining of the set of anticipated demands and/or the setting of prices are implemented as instruction code executed on a processor device...|$|R
