5|$|After {{the journey}} restarts, the train enters a tunnel through the Splash Mountain log flume attraction, crosses a <b>trestle</b> <b>bridge</b> over the Critter Country section, wraps around the Rivers of America in the Frontierland section, and rolls through another tunnel before {{reaching}} Mickey's Toontown Depot between the Mickey's Toontown and Fantasyland sections. While {{the train is}} stopped at this station, a non-functioning water tower {{can be seen on}} the opposite side of the track to the station's depot building.|$|E
5|$|The city, {{which began}} as a {{frontier}} town, has several historical attractions. The Lethbridge Viaduct, {{commonly known as the}} High Level Bridge, is the longest and highest steel <b>trestle</b> <b>bridge</b> in North America. It was completed in 1909 on what was then the city's western edge. Indian Battle Park, in the coulees of the Oldman River, commemorates the last battle between the Cree and the Blackfoot First Nations in 1870.|$|E

5|$|Five bridges {{have been}} {{constructed}} across the Indian River Inlet. The first was a creosote timber <b>trestle</b> <b>bridge</b> built in 1934; its timbers deteriorated quickly in the maritime environment prevailing at the inlet. It {{was replaced by a}} concrete-and-steel swing bridge, the first to be named for Cullen, construction of which began in 1938. This swing bridge, which included a 4-foot (1.2-meter) pedestrian walkway and cost $165,900, opened with a dedication ceremony on May 28, 1940, but collapsed on February 10, 1948, succumbing to a combination of a very high tide combined with an easterly wind and ice flows deeply scouring the inlet bottom under its piers; a pickup truck on the bridge {{at the time of the}} collapse fell into the inlet, killing three men who drowned inside the truck. Another concrete-and-steel swing bridge completed in 1952, the second to be named for Cullen, also became structurally unsound due to ice flow and was closed in 1962 due to storm damage.|$|E
25|$|Another timber <b>trestle</b> <b>bridge</b> is {{encountered}} at 26.27km, before Tunnel 15 at (in its middle) 26.55km (curve left, straight, curve right, straight, curve left, 430m). There is a timber <b>trestle</b> <b>bridge</b> at 26.98km, {{followed by}} a timber bridge with a concrete pier at 27.55km. At 27.72km is a small steel deck-type bridge using fishbelly plate girders (Bridge 42) supported mid span by a concrete pier; this is {{followed by a}} single span steel bridge at 27.86km and two single span timber bridges at 28.22km and 28.53km.|$|E
25|$|The Surprise Creek Bridge, at 28.7km, is a 72.54m long steel {{lattice girder}} bridge set on tall {{concrete}} piers {{at the head of}} a waterfall. The approach spans are pin jointed. This is followed by a timber <b>trestle</b> <b>bridge</b> at 29.16km, and then Christmas Creek Bridge at 29.23km. The sixth and final steel {{lattice girder bridge}} on the section, the Christmas Creek Bridge is 39.6m long, with wrought iron trestles.|$|E

2500|$|On October 4, 2004, the BNSF Railway {{applied to}} the Surface Transportation Board to abandon [...] of the line from milepost 66.95 at Bay City to milepost 54.00 at Cane Junction and from milepost 0.00 at Cane Junction to milepost 7.94 at Newgulf. BNSF argued {{that there had been}} no rail traffic for two years. The {{assessment}} noted that there were four ballast deck frame <b>trestle</b> <b>bridges</b> on the Newgulf extension, all built in 1930. In addition, there were four open pile <b>trestle</b> <b>bridges</b> between Cane Junction and Bay City, all built between 1912 and 1922.|$|R
25|$|The {{bridge at}} 19.31km (Bridge 21) is a deck-type steel {{lattice girder bridge}} with timber {{trestles}} on the approach spans, and wrought iron piers. It is immediately followed by Tunnel 4 at 19.39km (straight, 93m). Tunnel 5 is located at 19.64km (curve left, 92 m long); Tunnel 6 at 19.91km (straight, 111m); and Tunnel 7 at 20.06km (curve left, 50m). There is a timber <b>trestle</b> <b>bridge</b> just before Tunnel 8, the latter being located at 20.25km (curve left, 103m), and Tunnel 9 is at 20.53km (straight then curve left, 179m). There is a high embankment between tunnels 8 and 9.|$|E
25|$|The first {{bridge on}} the site was built in 1853 for the {{original}} Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company line to Sandridge from Flinders Street to Port Melbourne at Hobsons Bay on Port Phillip, the first passenger railway line in Australia. In 1857 the St Kilda railway line had opened parallel to part of the line to Sandridge, and the original bridge was replaced in 1858 by a timber <b>trestle</b> <b>bridge</b> carrying two lines of rail traffic, with the tight curve of the original railway removed by rebuilding the bridge on a more oblique angle as seen today.|$|E
25|$|By 1799, {{the canal}} was {{complete}} between Bark Hill near Wigan and Johnson's Hillock near Chorley. However, by 1801, no design {{had even been}} agreed for the aqueduct over the River Ribble, and in July 1801 it was agreed to build a temporary tramroad to cross the river and span {{the gap between the}} northern and southern parts of the canal. The double-track Lancaster Canal Tramroad was opened in 1803 with three steam-worked inclined planes and a low <b>trestle</b> <b>bridge</b> across the Ribble. The canal was extended north from Johnson's Hillock to Walton Summit through a tunnel at Whittle Hills.|$|E
2500|$|For most of 2009, all {{service was}} suspended, {{so as to}} permit work to {{rehabilitate}} the line's four <b>trestle</b> <b>bridges.</b> The longest of these is Riverwood Trestle, which is [...] long and about [...] high.|$|R
25|$|Trestles - Trestles is {{inaccessible}} by vehicle; a {{long walk}} from either the north or south end passing under the <b>Trestles</b> <b>Bridge</b> is necessary for access. This world-famous surfing area {{is known for its}} consistent waves.|$|R
50|$|Crib bridges {{were made}} from {{horizontally}} placed logs. The logs were laid first lengthwise, and then crosswise, in several layers. This consumed more trees than building <b>trestle</b> <b>bridges,</b> but they were easier to build without cranes or rams.|$|R
25|$|A later (>1885?) {{enlargement}} of the tunnel under Fishergate (Moss, 1968) continues in use for vehicle access to the Fishergate Shopping Centre car park - it formerly accessed the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Butler Street goods yard (Biddle, 1989). Part of a support for a bridge over Garden Street remains. A path on {{the northern edge of}} Avenham Park follows the route of the tramway, down the Avenham Incline and across a footbridge over the River Ribble {{on the site of the}} original <b>trestle</b> <b>bridge.</b> The footpath continues along the flood plain embankment to the Penwortham Incline.|$|E
25|$|The Noojee railway line is {{a closed}} railway line in Victoria, Australia. Branching off from the Gippsland line at Warragul station, it was built to service the timber {{industry}} in the upper Latrobe River area, transporting timber {{as well as providing}} a general goods and passenger service to townships in the area. The final section of the line between Neerim South and Noojee traversed increasingly hilly terrain and featured a number of large timber trestle bridges. Extensively and repeatedly damaged by bushfires over the years, the line was closed in the 1950s and dismantled. The last remaining large <b>trestle</b> <b>bridge</b> on the line has been preserved and has become a popular local tourist attraction.|$|E
25|$|The line {{continues}} north past Forwards Lookout {{and then}} passes Robb's Monument, a stone monolith {{east of the}} track. There is a timber <b>trestle</b> <b>bridge</b> at 29.93km, before Bridge 50 over Mervyn Creek at 30.18km, with steel girders on concrete piers. Barron Falls Station, between 30.65km and 30.82km, includes a modern platform, shelter shed and lookout over the Barron Falls, {{as well as a}} footbridge over the line {{at the south end of}} the station. The shelter shed has a similar timber roof frame to the shelter at Stoney Creek Station, although it uses steel posts. The line continues along the west bank of the Barron River past the site of Hydro Station, to Jumrum Creek Bridge at 32.54km. This bridge has timber trestles at each end, with a central span of steel broad flanged beams between concrete piers.|$|E
50|$|The North East Dundas Tramway {{on which}} they worked traversed {{some of the most}} rugged terrain in the world served by a railway at the time. It {{featured}} long stretches of 1-in-25 grades, high <b>trestle</b> <b>bridges</b> and 30-metre-radius reverse curves.|$|R
50|$|The {{line has}} {{a large number of}} short timber <b>trestle</b> <b>bridges</b> with {{concrete}} abutments, along with a smaller number of medium-size timber <b>trestle</b> <b>bridges,</b> such as the High Bridge in the Delaney Gorge. Longer bridges on the line include those at Junction Creek, Lighthouse Creek, the Einasleigh River and the Copperfield River. Some bridges have one or more concrete piers, and some timbers have been replaced with steel. The bridges without stonework are not of cultural heritage significance, as they were designed to be cheaply replaced if damaged during floods, and the larger bridges have been replaced at various times; for example the Copperfield Bridge was destroyed in 1927, 1980 and 2002.|$|R
5000|$|Intensive {{development}} {{began in}} 1950. Development from multiple drilling sites connected by <b>trestle</b> <b>bridges</b> also employed deviated holes. In 1953, {{to maintain the}} reservoir pressure, a water flood was applied. The field is still delivering about [...] after 50 years of exploitation.|$|R
25|$|Travelling west {{along the}} {{southern}} side of the Stoney Creek Gorge, at 20.72km {{there is a second}} steel lattice girder bridge (Bridge 23), with timber trestles on the approaches and two concrete piers, which is followed by two timber trestle bridges (the first also has one concrete pier) prior to Tunnel 10 at 21.06km (straight then curve left, 119m). Tunnel 11 is at 21.30km (curve left, 83m), and is followed by two very small single span steel bridges over concrete drains at 21.58km and 21.60km. Kelly?s Leap follows, where a modern rock fall barrier has been erected near an early open concrete drain. These are followed by timber trestle bridges at 21.76km and 21.92km, and then Tunnel 12 at 22.04km (curve right then straight, 81m). There is a timber <b>trestle</b> <b>bridge</b> at 22.18km, followed by Tunnel 13 at 22.47km (straight then curve left, 88m).|$|E
25|$|From Redlynch Station, {{the railway}} line heads south past Jungara to Horseshoe Bend, before heading {{north along the}} eastern side of the Lamb Range and turning west into Stoney Creek Gorge. Between Redlynch and Stoney Creek Station there are 13 tunnels and 16 bridges. The first bridge (deck type) is located at a {{distance}} of 12.06km from Cairns. It uses timber girders on timber trestles (some trestle piles and headstocks have already been replaced with steel); this is the form used by the majority of timber bridges on the section, although some use single-span timber girders between concrete abutments. A second timber bridge, with a concrete pier, exists at 13.05km. The site of Jungara Station is passed at 13.82km, with a timber <b>trestle</b> <b>bridge</b> at 14.77km, just before Horseshoe Bend, a 5 chain curve with a large earth embankment. There are two more timber trestle bridges at 15.31km and 16.55km, plus a single span timber girder bridge between concrete abutments at 16.95km, before reaching the first tunnel at 17.12km. Tunnel 1 is concrete lined (as are all the tunnels), straight and 66m long. Tunnel 2, located at 18.42km, is straight with a left curve at the uphill end and 76m long; while Tunnel 3 is at 19.11km (curve left, then straight, 109m).|$|E
500|$|Bulldozers carved Schwimmer Drome {{out of the}} jungle. Only a {{few feet}} above the normal level of the Laloki River, it was {{susceptible}} to periodic flooding. The base material used for the [...] runway was laid over alluvial sand and gravel, and Marston Mat used for the surface. The resulting runway was [...] not capable of all-weather operation, so a second runway was constructed parallel to the first. This time gravel dredged from the Laloki River {{was used as a}} base. It was spread while wet and then rolled to form a firm base. Marston Mat was removed from the original to provide a surface for the new [...] all-weather [...] runway, which was ready for use in November 1942. A low <b>trestle</b> <b>bridge</b> over the Laloki River provided access. It was understood that the bridge might be washed away by floods, so pontoon equipment was provided for this eventuality. This was needed; a downpour on 21 October swept away the bridge, and rendered Three Mile, Seven Mile and Thirty Mile non-operational. The bridge was replaced by a high steel structure.|$|E
25|$|After Stoney Creek Bridge {{the line}} {{proceeds}} north-east {{along the northern}} side of the Stoney Creek Gorge, over two timber <b>trestle</b> <b>bridges</b> at 23.39km and 23.78km, plus a single span timber bridge at 23.89km and a single span steel bridge at 24.54km, before entering Tunnel 14 at 24.69km (curve left, 85m). Glacier Rock looms {{to the north of}} the line at this point. The line then passes the site of The Springs Station before cutting alongside The Red Bluff and entering the Barron Gorge. There is a single span steel bridge at 25.49km, and a modern footbridge over the line (Douglas Track) before two timber <b>trestle</b> <b>bridges</b> at 25. km and 25.95km. By this point the line has turned to the north-west.|$|R
50|$|A 14 mi Devils River State Recreational Trail {{is being}} built {{alongside}} the river to provide recreational hiking {{and access to the}} river.

500|$|On January 11, 2016, the DRR {{temporarily}} {{closed to}} accommodate the construction of [...] The original DRR roundhouse building, which became a maintenance facility for ride vehicles of other Disneyland attractions, was demolished around April 2016. The DRR reopened on July 29, 2017, with a new route along {{the northern edge of}} the Rivers of America named Columbia Gorge, which features rock formations, waterfalls, a <b>trestle</b> <b>bridge,</b> and the line's only left-hand turn. The DRR's dioramas were also given new special effects. During a media preview for the attraction's reopening the previous day, John Lasseter brought his Marie E. locomotive and drove it along the DRR's new route. Pulled behind the Marie E. were an inoperable locomotive and train car, which were both previously owned by Ward Kimball and run on his former Grizzly Flats Railroad. The inoperable locomotive, named Chloe, and the train car are now owned by the Orange Empire Railway Museum in Perris, California, which {{was in the process of}} restoring the Chloe to operating condition at the time of the DRR's media preview.|$|E
2500|$|Approximately [...] of {{the rail}} {{formation}} around the Noojee <b>Trestle</b> <b>Bridge</b> has been converted into the Noojee <b>Trestle</b> <b>Bridge</b> Rail Trail.

2500|$|After closure, {{the tracks}} and station {{buildings}} along the line were dismantled and many sections {{of the right of}} way were sold off. The Buln Buln Shire Council purchased the No. 7 Noojee <b>trestle</b> <b>bridge</b> from Victorian Railways for the nominal sum of Â£1 ($2). This historic eighteen-span structure, [...] long and [...] high, was one of three rebuilt in 1939 after the original structures were razed by the Black Friday bushfires.
