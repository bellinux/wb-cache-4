5|$|After the debacles of the Schwarz era {{and brief}} {{control of the}} team by the CFL (see above) the Argos were rescued by David Cynamon and Howard Sokolowski in 2004. There was {{optimism}} surrounding the duo's arrival and attendance figures improved in their six years heading the organization. It was also appreciated that the two were Torontonians after a quarter-century of foreign and/or corporate ownership. But by 2010 losses were great enough that the team was again put on <b>the</b> <b>block</b> <b>and</b> eventually sold to David Braley. There was some controversy surrounding Braley's takeover. He is simultaneously owner of the BC Lions, raising questions of competitive integrity. It was also revealed that Braley had bankrolled half of Cynamon and Sokolowski's initial $2 million buy-in of the Argos in 2004, and covered half their subsequent losses, in exchange for half of the 2007 Grey Cup profits.|$|E
5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> <b>and</b> therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E

25|$|The firm of Whidden & Lewis, Portland's {{pioneering}} architects, {{designed the}} Brewhouse. The building is designed in a medieval Tuscan style.

25|$|The Pershing Park {{site was}} {{originally}} {{occupied by a}} variety of 19th-century structures until about 1930, when the federal government took legal title to <b>the</b> <b>block</b> <b>and</b> demolished the structures on it.

Development of the square proved controversial, as different groups offered competing proposals for memorials to John J. Pershing, who had served as General of the Armies in World War I. These disagreements led to inaction, and by 1962 the square remained bare and often cluttered with trash. In September 1963, District of Columbia officials finally planted grass and flower beds to temporarily beautify the square.|$|E
25|$|Tuesday's Task: When Eric was {{nominated}} for Thursday's eviction, his Tuesday night task was to flatter and {{do whatever it takes}} to make sure a specific person did not vote to evict him, and he completed this task if that person voted to evict the other nominee.

Eric automatically voted for the winner of the AP poll, and he completed the task if the majority of HouseGuests voted to evict the same player he had been instructed to target. Eric successfully completed five of the eight tasks involving persuading the house to evict a nominee.

25|$|The Phoenix Block is a {{collection}} of buildings at 106–108 West Washington St. Today, only two of the original four buildings that made up the Phoenix Block remain. The Phoenix Block was so dubbed by the Daily Pantagraph as a remark on how quickly the buildings rose from the ashes after a fire in 1855. Originally, the buildings' upper floor served as offices for lawyers who tried cases in the original wood frame courthouse. The Kersey H. Fell Building of 1856 is one of downtown Bloomington's oldest structures. The Fell Building housed the office of local attorney Kersey Fell. His second floor office is the place where it is claimed that Jesse Fell first suggested to Abraham Lincoln he should run for president. Aside from the law offices the third floor once housed the Illinois Natural History Museum, in 1857, {{which was one of the}} first museums in Illinois. The storefronts have been home to numerous merchants over the years. From 1905 to 1922 Homuth Jewelry had a location along <b>the</b> <b>block</b> <b>and</b> Sorg's Jewelers had a location on the Phoenix Block from 1946 until 1988.

25|$|Once again, Akers' {{kick and}} Ware's return placed the Giants in good field position, with Manning {{beginning}} the drive at the Giants' 36-yard line with 1:10 left. However, the drive began with two incomplete passes, {{and after a}} third-down sack by DT Trevor Laws put the Giants at their own 29-yard line, the Giants called a timeout as the play clock was about to expire on fourth down with 12 seconds left. Officials then ruled to reset the game clock to 0:14 as the Giants' punt team and the Eagles' punt return team came onto the field. The snap from long snapper Zak DeOssie to punter Matt Dodge was high, and Dodge hastily kicked a line drive punt to Jackson rather than kicking {{the ball out of}} bounds. Jackson received the ball at the Eagles' 35-yard line and immediately muffed the catch before picking the ball up and backpedaling to the 30-yard line. (This was later claimed by some to cause the Giants' coverage to collapse, ironically assisting Jackson.) Jackson ran through a group of Giants and made it to midfield before receiving a huge block by WR Jason Avant on DeOssie, leaving no one in front of Jackson {{on the way to the}} end zone (Avant actually gave himself a concussion on <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> <b>and</b> both players were left lying on the field for the rest of the play). Ware followed Jackson but could not catch him. After the clock hit 0:00, Jackson ran parallel to the goal line across most of the width of the field—according to Jackson after the game, because he wanted to be sure the clock had expired, though some observers believed it to be due to his showboating nature — before advancing into the end zone for the game-winning touchdown. With no flags on the field, Jackson threw the ball into the New Meadowlands stands in celebration as the team gathered around him near the end zone. Giants head coach Tom Coughlin was so livid he threw his play sheet and notes onto the ground and ran onto the field before Jackson even reached the end zone, yelling at Dodge for not punting the ball out of bounds. Per NFL rules, Akers came out to kick the extra point and the Eagles won the game 38–31.|$|E
