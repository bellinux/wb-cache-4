5|$|Exclusive Jurisdiction is {{a concept}} whereby only one Grand Lodge will be {{recognised}} in any geographical area. If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will have <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>between</b> them, {{and they may not}} all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge. Other Grand Lodges had <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>between</b> them until the schism was healed.) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two over-lapping Grand Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share jurisdiction (for example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both).|$|E

50|$|The {{study of}} real estate at the {{graduate}} school level has taken many forms, giving rise to various educational models in different countries. The decision for individuals pursuing higher education in this field often comes down <b>to</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>between</b> a traditional degree {{with a focus on}} real estate (e.g., MBA with concentration in real estate) or an interdisciplinary, comprehensive degree (e.g., Master of Real Estate) focused wholly on real estate studies.|$|R

5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes of missing decompression stops. Diving suit failure in cold water may force the diver <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>between</b> hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver is willing to carry out.|$|E
5|$|A stealth {{game is a}} type {{of video}} game that tasks the player with using stealth to avoid or {{overcome}} antagonists. Games in the genre typically allow the player to remain undetected by hiding, using disguises or avoiding noise. Some games allow the player <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>between</b> a stealthy approach or directly attacking antagonists, but mostly rewarding the player for greater levels of stealth. The genre has employed espionage, counter-terrorism and rogue themes, with protagonists who are special forces operatives, spies, thieves, ninjas, and assassins. Some games have also combined stealth elements with other genres, such as first-person shooters and even platformers.|$|E

At the set, Bart confronts Milhouse and they fight, ruining everything. They end up in front of Greta and demand for her <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>between</b> them. Greta turns both boys down due to loss of interest in the two. The boys reconcile and join Canada's basketball team.|$|E

40|$|A metric for method {{complexity}} {{is proposed}} {{as an aid}} <b>to</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>between</b> competing methods, {{as well as in}} validating the effects of method integration or the products of method engineering work. It is based upon a generic method representation model previously developed by the author and adaptation of concepts used in the popular Function Point metric for system size. The proposed technique is illustrated by comparing two popular I. E. deliverables with counterparts in the object oriented Unified Modeling Language (UML). The paper recommends ways to improve the practical adoption of new methods...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of direct incentives, many firms applied {{to move to the}} Manor Royal estate: it was {{considered}} such an attractive place to relocate to that the Development Corporation was able <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>between</b> applicants to achieve the ideal mix of firms, and little advertising or promotion had to be undertaken. One year after Manor Royal was opened, eighteen firms were trading there, including four with more than 100 employees and one with more than 1,000. By 1964, businesses which had moved to the town since 1950 employed 16,000 people; the master plan had anticipated between 8,000 and 8,500. In 1978 there were 105 such firms, employing nearly 20,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Forced <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>between</b> {{accepting}} depreciated {{money in}} payment for outstanding debts or waiting long times to collect debts, creditors {{turned to the}} courts for relief. In 1822, Bourbon County circuit court judge James Clark ruled {{in the case of}} Williams v. Blair that the replevin law violated the state and federal constitutions. This ruling was so unpopular with the Relief Party that they attempted to remove him from office, but the 5935 vote fell just short of the needed two-thirds majority. Fayette County circuit court judge Francis P. Blair issued a similar ruling in the case of Lapsley v. Brashear.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Hatoful Boyfriend {{is similar}} to most other visual novels for the PC, with the {{controls}} limited to the mouse and the only interactions being clicking to forward the game's narrative or <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>between</b> multiple plot choices. The keyboard {{can also be used}} instead of the mouse, with the 'enter' key serving the same purpose as clicking. The save button can be employed at any point during the game, which also features several pages of save slots, allowing gameplay to be easily picked up from prior to a choice the player made. An arrow button in the upper right corner also allows the player to skip dialogue and interactions they have already experienced.|$|E

5|$|In the Commonwealth context, too, Britain {{knew that}} simply {{granting}} independence to Southern Rhodesia {{was out of}} the question as many of the Afro-Asian countries were also Commonwealth members. Statehood for Salisbury without majority rule would split the Commonwealth and perhaps cause it to break up, a disastrous prospect for British foreign policy. The Commonwealth repeatedly called on Britain to intervene directly should Southern Rhodesian defiance continue, while liberals in Britain worried that if left unchecked Salisbury might drift towards South African-style apartheid. Anxious to avoid having <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>between</b> Southern Rhodesia and the Commonwealth, Whitehall attempted to negotiate a middle way between the two, but ultimately put international considerations first, regarding them as more important.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin {{was one of}} {{the main}} advisors of King John during the dispute with the pope over Stephen Langton's {{appointment}} to the Archbishopric of Canterbury. Jocelin did not immediately leave England after Pope Innocent III placed an interdict on England. Jocelin encouraged John to settle with Innocent in early 1209, worried that Innocent would expand the interdict into an excommunication, forcing John's advisors <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>between</b> serving the king or obeying the pope. Nothing came of the negotiations, however. Jocelin did leave England when John was excommunicated in late 1209. Jocelin, along with Gilbert Glanvill, the Bishop of Rochester, was the subject of a mocking song on his conduct during the interdict.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{previous}} two presidential elections, no candidates were put forward for voters <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>between</b> in 1796. The Constitution provided for the selection of electors who would then elect a president. In seven states voters chose the presidential electors. In the remaining nine states, they were chosen by the state's legislature. The clear favorite of Democratic–Republicans was Jefferson, although he was very reluctant to run. There was little doubt that Adams would be {{the choice of a}} great majority of the Federalists. Even so, Hamilton also had hoped to lead the party.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to address the literature gap regarding online social network adoption in Japan. Two focus group sessions with college students who no longer use Facebook indicated that real name policy, interface complications, and security issues are the most important reasons of quitting the service. A further survey questionnaire also showed that Facebook users are significantly more comfortable using their real names and real profile pictures compared with non-users. The most important finding emerged from this study was that Japanese insularity also plays an important role when it comes <b>to</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>between</b> Japan-made and foreign origin social networks...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} decentralizing public good decision-making from a political and informational perspective. First, we explain why different levels of jurisdiction, central decision-maker and local ones, are likely to take their decisions under different informational structures by deriving the incentives of both potential decision-makers {{to look for the}} relevant pieces of information. By endogenizing the informational structures, we identify a trade-off in the choice between centralization and decentralization. It amounts <b>to</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>between</b> a costly information technology allowing to take optimal decisions and a free information technology subject to several distortionary influences.
