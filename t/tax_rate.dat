The tax would be levied on all U.S. retail sales for personal consumption on new goods and services. Critics argue that the sales <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> defined in the legislation would not be revenue neutral (that is, it would collect less for the government than the current tax system), and thus would increase the budget deficit, unless government spending were equally reduced.|$|E

Since {{it can be}} assumed that auditors who are also chartered tax consultants will not affect effective <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> for past years, longer-run three-year effective <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> are measured here by summing numerators and denominators of <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> over the current and following 2  years according to Mayberry et al. (2015). This procedure reduces the sample to 954 observations.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{computing}} <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> using national accounts and revenue statistics. Using this method we construct time-series of <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> for large industrial countries. The method identifies the revenue raised by different taxes at the general government level and defines aggregate measures of the corresponding tax bases. This method yields estimates of effective <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> on factor incomes and consumption consistent with the tax distortions faced by a representative agent in a general equilibrium framework. These <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> compare favorably with existing estimates of marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rates,</b> and highlight important international differences in tax policy. ...|$|R
5|$|As of 2005, South Dakota has {{the lowest}} per capita total state <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> in the United States.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} of empirical tax research is the identification and calculation of appropriate tax data. While there is consensus that average marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> are most suitable for studying the effects of tax policy on economic growth, due to data limitations the calculation of marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> has been limited to the U. S. and the U. K. This paper provides calculations of average marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> for the four Scandinavian countries using the methodologies of Seater [1982, 1985] and Barro and Sahasakul [1983, 1986]. Then, by pooling the newly calculated <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> for the Scandinavian countries with {{the data for the}} U. S. and the U. K., we investigate the effects of tax policy shocks on the per capita GDP growth rate. Our results suggest that an increase in average marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> has a negative impact on economic growth. Employing Additive Mixed Panel Models with penalized splines as estimation approach, we show that changes in <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> have nonlinear effects. Increasing average marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> {{turn out to be the}} most distorting at relatively moderate <b>tax</b> <b>rates.</b> [...] Average marginal tax rates,tax policy,economic growth,panel data analysis,additive mixed models...|$|R
