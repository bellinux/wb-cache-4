5|$|As a scout for the Houston Astros, Hal Newhouser {{evaluated}} Jeter extensively {{before the}} 1992 MLB draft. The Astros held the first overall {{pick in the}} draft, and Newhouser, convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, lobbied team management to select him. The Astros feared that Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract, so they passed on him, instead choosing Cal State Fullerton outfielder Phil Nevin, who signed with Houston for $700,000. Newhouser felt so strongly about Jeter's potential that he quit his job with the Astros in protest after <b>they</b> <b>ignored</b> his drafting advice.|$|E
5|$|From the 17th century, the Dutch {{established}} {{trade and}} political control on Sulawesi through the Dutch East Indies Company. Over two centuries, <b>they</b> <b>ignored</b> the mountainous {{area in the}} central Sulawesi, where Torajans lived, because access was difficult and it had little productive agricultural land. In the late 19th century, the Dutch became increasingly concerned about the spread of Islam {{in the south of}} Sulawesi, especially among the Makassarese and Bugis peoples. The Dutch saw the animist highlanders as potential Christians. In the 1920s, the Reformed Missionary Alliance of the Dutch Reformed Church began missionary work aided by the Dutch colonial government. In addition to introducing Christianity, the Dutch abolished slavery and imposed local taxes. A line was drawn around the Sa'dan area and called Tana Toraja ("the land of Toraja"). Tana Toraja was first a subdivision of the Luwu kingdom that had claimed the area. In 1946, the Dutch granted Tana Toraja a regentschap, and it was recognised in 1957 as one of the regencies of Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|The absolutist {{restoration}} in Spain and {{the growing}} influence of Artigas generated a political crisis in Buenos Aires, forcing Posadas to resign. Alvear became the new Supreme Director, but had to resign after three months. San Martín's plan was complicated as well by the Disaster of Rancagua, a royalist victory that restored absolutism in Chile, ending the Patria Vieja period. San Martín initially proposed a regular-sized army, simply to reinforce Chile, but changed to propose a larger one, to liberate the country from the occupation. Chileans Bernardo O'Higgins, José Miguel Carrera, Luis Carrera and Manuel Rodríguez, {{the leaders of the}} deposed Chilean rule, sought refugee in Cuyo, along with their armies. O'Higgins and Rodríguez were well received, but the Carrera brothers intended to act as a government in exile. <b>They</b> <b>ignored</b> the local laws of Cuyo, and their soldiers committed acts of vandalism. San Martín imprisoned them and sent them to Buenos Aires. They proposed a plan to liberate Chile, different to the one outlined by San Martín, who rejected it as impractical. This initiated a rivalry between the Carrera and San Martín.|$|E

30|$|From {{the methods}} tested, we {{selected}} three feature filters which included Chi-squared, ANOVA, and mutual information. The advantages of using these feature selection techniques are their speed, scalability and their {{independence of the}} classification. Our reasoning for choosing these methods is their {{ability to deal with}} sparse data. On the other hand, these methods have some drawbacks as well, <b>they</b> <b>ignore</b> feature dependencies and also <b>they</b> <b>ignore</b> interaction with the classifier [69]. In this section, we examine these methods and the results of applying them to our dataset.|$|R

De Tounens returned to Valparaíso to wait for the representatives of the Chilean government. <b>They</b> <b>ignored</b> him.

25|$|Jouett {{also helped}} General Edward Stevens escape. The general was {{recovering}} from wounds he received at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. From Swan Tavern, Jouett rode with General Stevens {{as he made his}} escape, but the wounded Stevens could not ride quickly enough to keep the British from catching up. Fortunately, Jouett had the eccentric habit of dressing in ornate military costume with a scarlet coat and a plumed hat and Stevens was dressed in shoddy clothing. British cavalry assumed that Jouett must be a high military officer, so <b>they</b> <b>ignored</b> the shabby general, and pursued Jouett, who successfully eluded them.|$|E

25|$|Manuel {{wished to}} induce the crusaders to cross to Asia Minor by the Hellespont, keeping {{them away from}} Constantinople. However, <b>they</b> <b>ignored</b> the advice of Manuel's {{ambassador}} and pushed towards Constantinople, arriving on 10 September. Manuel had extensively repaired and strengthened {{the walls of his}} capital as a safeguard against any crusader aggression. The Germans encamped around the suburban palace of Philopatium, but so pillaged it that it became quickly uninhabitable. They then moved to another suburban palace, Pikridion. The crusader force, which may have been suffering from a lack of food, made depredations on, and acts of violence against, the local population. Manuel was determined to get the Germans across the Bosporus as quickly as possible and mobilised part of his military forces to induce them to move.|$|E
25|$|The {{signature}} of Chief of State Phan Khắc Sửu {{was required to}} pass the ruling, but he referred the matter to the High National Council (HNC), an appointed civilian advisory body, to get their opinion. The HNC turned down the request. This was speculated {{to be due to}} the fact that many of the HNC members were old, and did not appreciate the generals’ negativity towards seniors. On 19 December, the generals dissolved the HNC and arrested some of the members as well as other civilian politicians. This prompted U.S. Ambassador Maxwell D. Taylor to angrily berate Thiệu, Thi, Kỳ and Cang in a private meeting and threaten to cut off aid if they did not reverse their decision. However, this galvanized the officers around Khánh for a time and <b>they</b> <b>ignored</b> Taylor's threats without repercussions as the Americans were too intent on defeating the communists to cut funding.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of how healthcare should be structured {{has been at the}} forefront of public debate for quite some time. In particular, debate has raged over the acceptability of socialized and rights-oriented approaches to healthcare as opposed to privatized and commodity-oriented approaches. The present discussion looks at the underlying logic of the debate and at the use of outcome measures as a primary determinant. It suggests that outcome measures are of limited use in deciding the issue because <b>they</b> <b>ignore</b> important variables and further suggests that outcome measures are inappropriate tools when comparing distinct healthcare systems because <b>they</b> <b>ignore</b> valuational components that are integral to deciding whether a healthcare system is consistent with a society's principles and values...|$|R
