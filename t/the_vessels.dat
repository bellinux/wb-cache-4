5|$|Their roles imposed several design {{limitations}} on <b>the</b> <b>vessels.</b> <b>The</b> <b>vessels</b> {{were designed to}} operate in coastal areas, which required a shallow draft {{in order for them}} to be able to enter any port on the Baltic seaboard. They also required a heavy armament, {{in order for them to}} be able to engage any hostile ironclad on equal terms. Because Stosch envisioned only local deployments for <b>the</b> <b>vessels,</b> they had limited coal stowage, as they could easily replenish their supply.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{a torrent}} of Japanese fire, the Australians broke contact and made for the landing craft, {{bringing}} the wounded out with them. The embarkation took only five minutes, but as <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> attempted to depart two of them, overloaded with about 60 men on board, ran aground and stuck fast. In an effort to lighten the load, several men volunteered to leave the craft, which enabled one of <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> to float free. The other, however, remained stuck. Coming under attack from the Japanese, some of whom waded out and attacked {{the men in the}} vessel with grenades, the casualties mounted, with a number of men, including Downs, being either killed or lost overboard and subsequently listed as missing, presumed killed.|$|E
5|$|In the {{simplest}} type of circulatory system, two lateral vessels are {{joined at the}} ends to form a loop. However, many species have additional long-wise and cross-wise vessels. There is no heart nor pumping vessels, and the flow of fluid depends on contraction of both <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> and the body wall's muscles. In some species, circulation is intermittent, and fluid ebbs and flows in the long-wise vessels. The fluid in <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> is usually colorless, but in some species it contains cells that are yellow, orange, green or red. The red type contain hemoglobin and carry oxygen, but {{the function of the}} other pigments is unknown.|$|E
50|$|It {{has also}} {{published}} {{a guide for}} each of the two types of contract between merchant and shipowner: Time Charters and Voyage Charters. In a Voyage Charter, the charterer hires <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> for a single voyage, while <b>the</b> <b>vessel’s</b> owner provides <b>the</b> master, crew, bunkers and supplies. In a Time Charter, <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> is hired for a specific amount of time. <b>The</b> <b>vessel’s</b> owner still manages <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> but <b>the</b> charterer directs <b>the</b> <b>vessel’s</b> operation, and may sub-charter <b>the</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In a time charter, <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> is {{hired for}} a {{specific}} amount of time.

50|$|An {{apparatus}} for underwater activities {{including a}} vessel filled fully or partially with water, which vessel includes {{one or more}} open openings for entering <b>the</b> <b>vessel,</b> wherein <b>the</b> lower portion of <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> is located within a body of water, all of {{the one or more}} open opening for entering <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> are located in that portion of <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> which is located under the surface level of the body of water, and that walls of <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> are transparent, or the walls include sections that are transparent, for allowing observation of the activities taking place inside <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> from outside of <b>the</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|R
5|$|Since 2000, archaeological {{investigations}} have been undertaken {{to find out}} more about <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> and their states of decay. Explanatory labels have been provided. One barge has been scheduled as an ancient monument and several are included in the National Register of Historic Vessels.|$|E

25|$|Charles John Ingstrom, {{owner and}} mate of the Advance, owned <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> from 7 July 1896. <b>The</b> <b>vessel's</b> Sydney {{registration}} number shows that <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> entered registration in Australia in 1897.|$|R
50|$|State of Washington {{was built}} in 1889 by John J. Holland in Tacoma, Washington. From 1889 to 1902 <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> {{was placed on the}} Seattle-Bellingham route. From 1902 to 1907, <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> was {{operated}} as a standby boat on the Tacoma-Seattle run. Later, <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> was assigned to the Hood Canal route. In 1913, <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> was transferred to the Columbia River to be operated by the Shaver Transportation Company. In 1915 <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> was converted to a towboat. In 1921, <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> was destroyed by a boiler explosion. Six crewmen were injured and one man was killed.|$|R
5000|$|A {{time charter}} is {{the hiring of}} a vessel for a {{specific}} period of time; the owner still manages <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> but <b>the</b> charterer selects the ports and directs <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> where to go.

5|$|All the New Spain {{flotilla}} arrived safely at Vera Cruz during February and March 1553. The {{plan was}} to scrap eleven of <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> and keep only five to make the return journey. This was typical. Ships from the Americas to Spain carried a much smaller volume of cargo than ships traveling in the other direction, although the shipments to Spain included valuable gold and silver.|$|E
5|$|Around 02:45, several British destroyers {{mounted a}} torpedo {{attack against the}} rear half of the German line. Markgraf {{initially}} held her fire as {{the identities of the}} destroyers were unknown. But gunners aboard Grosser Kurfürst correctly identified <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> as hostile and opened fire while turning away to avoid torpedoes, which prompted Markgraf to follow suit. Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw. At 05:06, Markgraf and several other battleships fired at what they thought was a submarine.|$|E
5|$|Bayern and Baden were {{regarded}} as exceptional sea boats by the German navy. Bayern and her sisters were stable and very maneuverable. The ships suffered slight speed loss in heavy seas; with the rudders hard over, the ships lost up to 62% speed and heeled over 7degrees. With a metacentric height of , larger than that of their British equivalents, <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> were stable gun platforms for the confined waters of the North Sea.|$|E
50|$|Additional duties include {{communicating}} with <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> person-in-charge utilizing a portable intrinsically safe two-way radio, spotting <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> during arrival to ensure <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> headers {{are lined up}} with the dock header, secure and proper placement of the gangway, operating the dock crane while positioning the transfer hose from the dock to <b>the</b> <b>vessel,</b> assisting in connecting the transfer hose or loading arm to <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> product manifold, and during the transfer monitoring the movement {{on a regular basis}} maintaining an hourly log.|$|R
50|$|When Pohjanmaa was decommissioned, it {{was stated}} that <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> would be either sold or {{scrapped}} if a sufficient buyer is not found. In September 2013, {{it was reported}} that the Estonian Navy was interested in purchasing <b>the</b> <b>vessel.</b> However, it was later reported that Estonia decided not to purchase <b>the</b> <b>vessel.</b> Some interest was also expressed by the Croatian Navy whose representatives even came to Finland to inspect <b>the</b> <b>vessel.</b> <b>The</b> Finnish towing and salvage company Alfons Håkans also offered to buy <b>the</b> <b>vessel,</b> but was declined.|$|R
50|$|When {{a vessel}} has {{negative}} metacentric height (GM) i.e., is in unstable equilibrium, any external force applied to <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> will {{cause it to}} start heeling. As it heels, the moment of inertia of <b>the</b> <b>vessel's</b> waterplane (a plane intersecting the hull at the water's surface) increases, which increases <b>the</b> <b>vessel's</b> BM (distance {{from the center of}} Buoyancy to the Metacenter). Since there is relatively little change in KB (distance from the Keel to the center of Buoyancy) of <b>the</b> <b>vessel,</b> <b>the</b> KM (distance from Keel to the Metacenter) of <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> increases.|$|R
5|$|Brain AVMs may be {{detected}} on computed tomography angiography (CTA or CT angio) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA); CTA is better in showing <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> themselves, and MRA provides more {{detail about the}} relationship between an AVM and surrounding brain tissue. In general, MRI is recommended. Various types of vascular malformations may be encountered: AVMs, micro-AVMs, telangiectasias and arteriovenous fistulas. If surgery, embolization, or other treatment is contemplated (see below), cerebral angiography may be required to get sufficient detail of <b>the</b> <b>vessels.</b> This procedure carries a small risk of stroke (0.5%) and is therefore limited to specific circumstances. Recent professional guidelines recommend that all children with suspected or definite HHT undergo a brain MRI early in life to identify AVMs that can cause major complications. Others suggest that screening for cerebral AVMs is probably unnecessary in those who are not experiencing any neurological symptoms, because most lesions discovered on screening scans would not require treatment, creating undesirable conundrums.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s, Suharto's {{government}} came to {{be dominated}} by civilian politicians such as Habibie, Harmoko, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, and Akbar Tanjung, who owed their position solely to Suharto. As sign of Habibie's growing clout, when two prominent Indonesian magazines and a tabloid newspaper reported on criticism over Habibie's purchase of almost the entire fleet of the disbanded East German Navy in 1993 (most of <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> were of scrap-value), the Ministry of Information ordered the offending publications be closed down on 21 June 1994.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the demise}} of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the {{creation}} of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS), Austria-Hungary transferred <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> of the former Austro-Hungarian Navy to the new nation. The Kingdom of Italy was unhappy with this, and convinced the Allies to share the Austro-Hungarian ships among the victorious powers. As a result, the only modern sea-going vessels left to the KSCS were 12 torpedo boats, and they had to build their naval forces almost from scratch.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>vessel</b> entered {{operation}} with Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) in 1988 as Seaward. <b>The</b> <b>vessel</b> was renamed Norwegian Sea in 1997. In 2005, <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> {{was transferred to}} the Star Cruises fleet and renamed SuperStar Libra.|$|R

5|$|Histamines are {{proteins}} {{associated with}} many allergic reactions. When the UV radiation or light {{comes in contact}} with a person with solar urticaria, histamine is released from mast cells. When this occurs, the permeability of vessels near the area of histamine release is increased. This allows blood fluid to enter <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> and cause inflammation. Antihistamines suppress {{the activity of the}} histamine.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{under the}} code name Project 28, the Indian Navy placed {{an order for}} four ASW corvettes. The corvette's design was {{originally}} planned {{to be based on}} the Russian corvette Project 2038.2, however the basic design was later provided by the Indian Navy's Directorate of Naval Design, followed by the detailed design by GRSE. The design includes many stealth ship features, including reductions in acoustic signature and vibration of <b>the</b> <b>vessels.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>vessel</b> was refloated and towed back to Townsville port by the , the salvage {{paid for}} by a {{syndicate}} of local investors led by a Mr. Page of the Port of Townsville. The contents and cargo of <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> were then sold at a profit, with <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> returning to service with Burns, Philp and Company Limited used as a coal hulk. In 1911, Dr McCabe, a local dentist who owned property at Geoffrey Bay purchased the hulk {{with the intent to}} scuttle <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> to protect <b>the</b> jetty located in the bay. An explosives expert, William Bright, was contracted to sink <b>the</b> <b>vessel.</b> Accounts of <b>the</b> event suggest that while <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> was being towed into place, the fuse for the explosives was lit prematurely by an intoxicated Bright. The tug boat pilot was able to release the tow lines and pilot clear of <b>the</b> <b>vessel.</b> However, <b>the</b> explosives aboard <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> detonated and scuttled the boat in the wrong location and 10m depth.|$|R
50|$|Whilst <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> {{remained}} busy, Micoperi {{were struggling}} financially as the low oil price {{prevalent in the}} late 1980s curtailed oil company investment. In 1991 Micoperi were forced to sell a number of their major assets including the Micoperi 7000 to another Italian contractor Saipem. Saipem took over the running of <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> though they retained <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> crew and <b>the</b> shorebased engineering support. Saipem renamed <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>the</b> Saipem 7000.|$|R
