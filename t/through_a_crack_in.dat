After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood {{over the course of}} a day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.|$|E

Bostock was not consulted about the decision and fully expected to see Australian aircraft as he watched for the Allied formations from a US warship during the battle. He later said that he would have thankfully [...] "fallen <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> the boards on the deck" [...] when he saw only American aircraft flying overhead, and had to apologise to Kenney for the RAAF's absence.

What I loved about this LUT was how it allowed the costume to retain the color but took it from fire-engine red to something a little more weathered." ...|$|E
500|$|Responsible as CAS for {{building}} up Australia's air combat assets, in 1943 Jones had given an assurance to the Australian government {{that he could}} maintain a force of 73squadrons, despite Kenney's prediction that even the RAAF's then-currently approved strength of 45squadrons was beyond its capacity. In the event, {{by the end of}} the war Jones had expanded the RAAF to 70squadrons in the Pacific and Europe, including several heavy bomber units. One of his most controversial decisions of the war was during the invasion of Tarakan in May 1945 when he grounded Australian B-24 Liberator squadrons scheduled to take part in the attack, due to their crews having exceeded their monthly quota of flying hours. Bostock was not consulted, and said that he would have thankfully [...] "fallen <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> the boards on the deck" [...] as he watched the attacking formations from a U.S. warship, minus the expected RAAF aircraft.

After Protesilaus {{was killed in the}} Trojan War he was allowed to return to his wife for only three hours before returning to the underworld because they had only just married. Thereafter Laodamia was described as possibly having committed suicide by stabbing herself, rather than be without him. According to Hyginus' Fabulae, however, the story runs like this: [...] "When Laodamia, daughter of Acastus, after her husband's loss had spent the three hours which she had asked from the gods, she could not endure her weeping and grief. And so she made a bronze likeness of her husband Protesilaus, put it in her room under pretense of sacred rites, and devoted herself to it. When a servant early in the morning had brought fruit for the offerings, he looked <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> the door and saw her holding the image of Protesilaus in her embrace and kissing it.

During the 2012 Olympic Games, the Doctor picks up the Olympic flame and carries it to the end, starting the Games. The series finale takes place in contemporary London, where modern-day Torchwood is the scene for war between the evil alien Daleks and parallel-universe cyborgs the Cybermen; saving the Earth costs the Doctor Rose, who is stranded in a parallel universe, along with Mickey and her mother, in [...] "Doomsday".|$|E
