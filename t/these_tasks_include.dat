500|$|The {{levels are}} based on regions of the United States and other countries. In each level, certain tasks that advance the game's {{narrative}} must be completed before the player can move on. <b>These</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>include</b> score attacks, races, item collection, and reaching one of many gaps found in a level. Each level houses one professional skateboarder, who provides a sidequest that unlocks a trick for the Special Meter. On account of the levels' large sizes and the integration of goals into the story, Underground {{has been described as}} an adventure game. Characters can level up their stats—which include jump height and speed—by completing optional goals in a level; this adds an element of role-playing gameplay. Other gameplay modes include multiplayer minigames—one, a combat mode called [...] "Firefight", can be played online in the PlayStation 2 version of the game—and a [...] "free skate" [...] mode that lets the player explore levels with no goals or story.|$|E
2500|$|Losing {{working memory}} {{has been cited}} as being {{the primary reason for}} a decline in a variety of {{cognitive}} tasks due to aging. <b>These</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>include</b> long-term memory, problem solving, decision making, and language. Working memory involves the manipulation of information that is being obtained, and then using this information to complete a task. For example, the ability of one to recite numbers they have just been given backwards requires working memory, rather than just simple rehearsal of the numbers which would require only short-term memory. One's ability to tap into one's working memory declines as the aging process progresses. It has been seen that the more complex a task is, the more difficulty the aging person has with completing this task. Active reorganization and manipulation of information becomes increasingly harder as adults age.|$|E

50|$|The {{game will}} feature a needs system which will require the player to sleep or eat {{in order to stay}} healthy. Equipment and {{clothing}} will also degrade and require repair.

The main fears are that the permanent milita would turn themselves into enforcers of Shiite domination.

To be considered a self-published author, an author need not complete all of these creative tasks themselves, however. Authors can outsource this creative work to other skilled professionals.

50|$|The {{problem is}} {{considered}} to be among the hardest in all of AI research because the breadth and detail of commonsense knowledge is enormous. Any task that requires commonsense knowledge is considered AI-complete: to be done as well as a human being does it, it requires the machine to appear as intelligent as a human being. <b>These</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>include</b> machine translation, object recognition, text mining and many others. To do these tasks perfectly, the machine simply has to know what the text is talking about or what objects it may be looking at, and this is impossible in general unless the machine is familiar with all the same concepts that an ordinary person is familiar with.|$|E
50|$|Rover Scouts, {{in teams}} of two, walk a {{distance}} of at least 200 km in 10 days completing tasks along the way. <b>These</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>include</b> maintaining a log of the journey, consisting of a daily route, menu, budget and account of the day's activities. Each team must also complete a number of challenges, both Prescribed and Personal which encourage the participants to engage with the local populace and {{to learn about the}} local culture. Each team must find its own way back to a base camp where the expedition leaders are waiting for them. Teams are dropped off in an unknown location with just a map, the location of base camp and a small amount of money on which to survive.|$|E
50|$|The tasks {{presented}} in these games are usually trivial for humans, but difficult for computers. <b>These</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>include</b> labeling images, transcribing ancient texts, common sense or human experience based activities, and more. Human-based computation games motivate people through entertainment {{rather than an}} interest in solving computation problems. This makes GWAPs more appealing to a larger audience. GWAPs {{can be used to}} help build the semantic web, annotate and classify collected data, crowdsource general knowledge, and improving other general computer processes.GWAPs have a vast range of applications in variety of areas such as security, computer vision, Internet accessibility, adult content filtering, and Internet search. In applications such as these, games with a purpose have lowered the cost of annotating data and increased the level of human participation.|$|E

The proposed visualization supports several tasks: the comparison of structural information, including class hierarchies, across several revisions; uncovering collaboration patterns between developers; and determining which classes have been added or deleted to the project during the creation of a given revision. We propose and discuss several design elements supporting <b>these</b> <b>tasks,</b> <b>including</b> interaction patterns and linked views. ...|$|R

If they answered their question correctly, they could select an ingredient and continue to the next location. If they did not, they had to perform a food preparation task before continuing and selecting an ingredient. <b>These</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>included</b> rolling dough for baguettes and butchering a chicken.

5000|$|Mission Control {{decided to}} cancel the first midcourse {{correction}} (MCC-1). This would {{give them a chance}} to fire the SPS engine at the second planned correction. This cancellation meant that tasks that would have been done later could be brought forward and the crew could get to sleep sooner. <b>These</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>included</b> a water dump and putting the spacecraft into Passive Thermal Control (PTC) or what was often called [...] "barbecue mode", as the spacecraft was put into a slow roll so that there was even heat distribution. Nearly 15 hours after launch, the crew switched off the lights in the cabin and went to sleep.|$|R
