5|$|Laubenstein {{developed}} appendicitis in 1984 and {{was afraid}} to undergo surgery {{because of the risk}} that general anesthesia would pose to her lungs, already compromised from polio. After the operation, her surgeons had trouble weaning her off <b>the</b> <b>ventilator</b> and she suffered a psychotic breakdown requiring admission to a psychiatric hospital; the psychiatrists theorized that her hallucinations were caused by hypoxia from the anesthesia. In 1990, she fell ill with a combination of asthma, gastroenteritis and respiratory failure, though she continued to work. She started taking corticosteroids for her respiratory problems—which were exacerbated by allergies to her two pet cats—and was unable to wean herself off them despite experiencing side effects.|$|E

After Girish brings Tara the {{required}} insurance papers, she thanks him for always being there for her and apologises for being rude. She decides {{to go ahead with}} the surgery after all. Rajat is taken to surgery, and she holds his hand until they arrive at the operating room. Shiv, on the other hand, decides to take Pankaja off <b>the</b> <b>ventilator</b> and let his wife herself make the final call. Pankaja tries to breathe on her own as the viewers are treated with flashbacks of the heyday of both couples. Tara takes a seat in the waiting lounge, and is joined by Shiv as the camera pans out.|$|E

Instead, a renegotiated contract was signed, whereby Siemens was obliged to deliver the locomotives, as specified, by mid-1997. If not, the two parties agreed that the contract would be terminated. By late 1996, five locomotives had been delivered, and these were returned to Kiel for upgrades.

5|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, the British {{steamship}} Rosina {{encountered the}} hurricane. The storm damaged the pipes and smokestacks, ripped out <b>the</b> <b>ventilator,</b> and washed 30,000oranges into the sea. Additionally, a Greek sailor was swept overboard and presumably drowned. The storm sunk or drove many ships ashore along the Yucatán Peninsula. Communications were disrupted {{in many areas}} after telegraph lines fell, while a number of roads were left impassible after trees toppled. In the Tampico area, there was considerable damage to the port and many ships being sunk or driven ashore. All of the bridges along Monterey and Mexican Gulf Railroad were destroyed. The roof at the general market was almost completely torn off. Many of the businesses suffered serious losses after rain subsequently poured in the building, with damage reaching at least $4,200 (10,000pesos). The chamber of commerce building collapsed with people inside, though no injuries or deaths occurred. Much of the land between Tampico and Cárdenas in San Luis Potosí was submerged due to flooding. In Barra, a city in Tamaulipas, the hospital was nearly destroyed, as was the marketplace. In San Luis Potosí, the casino and restaurant in Tamasopo were demolished. Twenty bridges were destroyed in San Luis Potosí. Railroad traffic between San Luis Potosí and Monterrey, the capital of Nuevo León, was completely disrupted.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of modern}} {{ventilators}} have basic monitoring tools. There are also monitors that work independently of <b>the</b> <b>ventilator,</b> which allow to measure patients after <b>the</b> <b>ventilator</b> has been removed, {{such as a}} T tube test.|$|E

25|$|Pressure {{support is}} a {{spontaneous}} mode of ventilation also named Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV).

25|$|Within each {{ventilatory}} pattern {{there are}} several variations that can be distinguished by their targeting scheme(s). A targeting scheme is a description of how <b>the</b> <b>ventilator</b> achieves preset targets. A target is a predetermined goal of ventilator output. Examples of within-breath targets include inspiratory flow or pressure and rise time (set-point targeting), tidal volume (dual targeting) and constant of proportionality between inspiratory pressure and patient effort (servo targeting). Examples of between-breath targets and targeting schemes include average tidal volume (for adaptive targeting), percent minute ventilation (for optimal targeting) and combined PCO2, volume, and frequency values describing a “zone of comfort” (for intelligent targeting, e.g., SmartCarePS or IntelliVent-ASV). The targeting scheme (or combination of targeting schemes) is what distinguishes one ventilatory pattern from another. There are 7 basic targeting schemes that comprise the wide variety seen in different modes of ventilation: Set-point: A targeting scheme for which the operator sets all {{the parameters of the}} pressure waveform (pressure control modes) or volume and flow waveforms (volume control modes).Dual: A targeting scheme that allows <b>the</b> <b>ventilator</b> to switch between volume control and pressure control during a single inspiration.Bio-variable: A targeting scheme that allows <b>the</b> <b>ventilator</b> to automatically set the inspiratory pressure or tidal volume randomly to mimic the variability observed during normal breathing.Servo: A targeting scheme for which inspiratory pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort.Adaptive: A targeting scheme that allows <b>the</b> <b>ventilator</b> to automatically set one target (eg, pressure within a breath) to achieve another target (eg, average tidal volume over several breaths).Optimal: A targeting scheme that automatically adjusts the targets of the ventilatory pattern to either minimize or maximize some overall performance characteristic (eg, minimize the work rate done by the ventilatory pattern).Intelligent: A targeting scheme that uses artificial intelligence programs such as fuzzy logic, rule based expert systems, and artificial neural networks.|$|E
25|$|Positive-pressure {{ventilators}} work {{by increasing}} the patient's airway pressure through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. The positive pressure allows air to flow into the airway until <b>the</b> <b>ventilator</b> breath is terminated. Then, the airway pressure drops to zero, and the elastic recoil of the chest wall and lungs push the tidal volume — the breath-out through passive exhalation.|$|E
25|$|Exhalation in {{mechanical}} ventilation {{is almost always}} completely passive. <b>The</b> <b>ventilator's</b> expiratory valve is opened, and expiratory flow is allowed until the baseline pressure (PEEP) is reached. Expiratory flow is determined by patient factors such as compliance and resistance.|$|R

25|$|The most {{traumatic}} case of anesthesia {{awareness is}} full consciousness during surgery {{with pain and}} explicit recall of intraoperative events. In less severe cases, patients may have only poor recollection of conversations, events, pain, pressure, or difficulty in breathing. Some cases of difficulty in breathing are caused by intubation errors and/or problems with <b>the</b> <b>ventilator</b> and a patient might be suffocating.|$|E
25|$|To flush the machine, first remove or disable the vaporizers {{and then}} flush the machine with 10 L/min or greater fresh {{gas flow rate}} for at least 20 minutes. While {{flushing}} the machine <b>the</b> <b>ventilator</b> should be set to periodically ventilate a new breathing circuit. The soda lime should also be replaced. After machine preparation, anesthesia should be induced and maintained with non-triggering agents. The time required to flush a machine varies for different machines and volatile anesthetics. This prevention technique was optimized to prepare older generation anesthesia machines. Modern anesthetic machines have more rubber and plastic components which provide a reservoir for volatile anesthetics, and should be flushed for 60 minutes.|$|E

40|$|Background: Noninvasive positive-pressure {{ventilation}} (NPPV) modes {{are currently}} available on bilevel and ICU ventilators. However, little data comparing {{the performance of}} the NPPV modes on these ventilators are available. Methods: In an experimental bench study, the ability of nine ICU ventilators to function in the presence of leaks was compared with a bilevel <b>ventilator</b> using <b>the</b> IngMar ASL 5000 lung simulator (IngMar Medical; Pittsburgh, PA) set at a compliance of 60 mL/cm H(2) O, an inspiratory resistance of 10 cm H(2) O/L/s, an expiratory resistance of 20 cm H(2) O/L/s, and a respiratory rate of 15 breaths/min. All of <b>the</b> <b>ventilators</b> were set at 12 cm H(2) O pressure support and 5 cm H(2) O positive end-expiratory pressure. The data were collected at baseline and at three customized leaks. Main results: At baseline, all of <b>the</b> <b>ventilators</b> were able to deliver adequate tidal volumes, to maintain airway pressure, and to synchronize with the simulator, without missed efforts or auto-triggering. As the leak was increased, all of <b>the</b> <b>ventilators</b> (except <b>the</b> Vision [Respironics; Murrysville, PA] and Servo I [Maquet; Solna, Sweden]) needed adjustment of sensitivity or cycling criteria to maintain adequate ventilation, and some transitioned to backup ventilation. Significant differences in triggering and cycling were observed between the Servo I and <b>the</b> Vision <b>ventilators.</b> Conclusions: <b>The</b> Vision and Servo I were <b>the</b> only <b>ventilators</b> that required no adjustments as they adapted to increasing leaks. There were differences in performance between these two <b>ventilators,</b> although <b>the</b> clinical significance of these differences is unclear.

500|$|The breastwork monitor was {{developed}} during the 1860s by Sir Edward Reed, Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy, as an improvement of the basic monitor design developed by John Ericsson during the American Civil War. Reed gave these ships a superstructure to increase seaworthiness and raise the freeboard of the gun turrets {{so they could be}} worked in all weathers. The superstructure was armoured to protect the bases of the turrets, the funnels and <b>the</b> <b>ventilator</b> ducts in what he termed a breastwork. The ships were conceived as harbour defence ships with little need to leave port. This meant that they could dispense with the masts, sails and rigging needed to supplement their coal-fired steam engines over any distance. Reed took advantage of the lack of masts and designed the ships with one twin-gun turret {{at each end of the}} superstructure, each able to turn and fire in a 270° arc. These ships were described by Admiral George Alexander Ballard as being like [...] "full-armoured knights riding on donkeys, easy to avoid but bad to close with".
