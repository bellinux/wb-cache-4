5|$|During {{the threat}} display, any sudden {{movement}} by the intruder may provoke the mamba {{into a series}} of rapid strikes leading to severe envenomation. Also, the size of the black mamba, plus its ability <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>its</b> head well off the ground, enable it to launch as much as 40% of its body length upwards, so mamba bites in humans quite often are on the upper body. This behaviour also permits the snake to land a strike at unexpectedly long range. The black mamba's reputed readiness to attack is often much exaggerated and usually is provoked by perceived threats, such as blocking its intended retreat, accidentally or otherwise.|$|E
5|$|High-pressure systems, {{also known}} as anticyclones, rotate outward at the surface and {{clockwise}} in the northern hemisphere as opposed to outward and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. Under surface highs, sinking of the atmosphere slightly warms the air by compression, leading to clearer skies, winds that are lighter, and a reduced chance of precipitation. The descending air is dry, hence less energy is required <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>its</b> temperature. If high pressure persists, air pollution will build up due to pollutants trapped near the surface caused by the subsiding motion associated with the high.|$|E

5|$|The Phengaris rebeli is a brood parasite, an {{organism}} that manipulates another organism (the host) <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>its</b> offspring; in this case, the P. rebeli parasitizes a particular species of ant, the Myrmica schencki. The P. rebeli was first discovered to be a brood parasite when a researcher observed M. schencki ants bringing the P. rebeli larvae {{back to their}} own nest. One of the proposed hypotheses for this parasitism was that P. rebeli larvae released chemicals to confuse the ants into believing they were ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Dudley {{was elected}} {{governor}} in 1645, with Winthrop as his deputy. Endecott, as a consolation, was given {{command of the}} colonial militia, reporting to the governor. He was also once again made a governor's assistant, and was chosen to represent the colony to the confederation in 1646. The threat of Indian conflicts in neighbouring colonies prompted the colony <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>its</b> defensive profile, in which Endecott played a leading role. Winthrop was reelected governor in 1646; {{after his death in}} 1649, Endecott succeeded him as governor. By annual re-elections Endecott served nearly continuously until his death in 1664/5; for two periods (1650–1651 and 1654–1655) he was deputy governor.|$|E
5|$|A {{white dwarf}} star may {{accumulate}} sufficient material from a stellar companion <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>its</b> core temperature enough to ignite carbon fusion, at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting it. There are three avenues by which this detonation is theorized to happen: stable accretion of material from a companion, the collision of two white dwarfs, or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites. The dominant mechanism by which Type Ia supernovae are produced remains unclear. Despite this uncertainty in how Type Ia supernovae are produced, Type Ia supernovae have very uniform properties, and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances. Some calibrations are required {{to compensate for the}} gradual change in properties or different frequencies of abnormal luminosity supernovae at high red shift, and for small variations in brightness identified by light curve shape or spectrum.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the company}} had {{permission}} to construct the railway, it still had to raise the capital for the construction works. The BS was not alone; four other new tube railway companies were looking for investors– the Waterloo and City Railway (W), the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE) and the Great Northern and City Railway (GN) (the three other companies that were put forward in bills in 1892) and the Central London Railway (CLR, which received royal assent in 1891).

5|$|Another {{proposed}} mission {{would have}} seen a Gemini spacecraft rendezvous with a Pegasus satellite in low Earth orbit. The spacecraft would have either been launched directly into an orbit to rendezvous with the Pegasus, or into a lower orbit, subsequently docking with an Agena, and using that <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>its</b> orbit. The Gemini would have flown around the Pegasus, {{and then one of}} the crew would have performed an EVA to recover a piece of one of the spacecraft's micrometeoroid detection panels. This mission would have been used to prove that rendezvous could be accomplished with any spacecraft, to collect data on the satellite's exposure to micrometeoroids — supporting data that the satellite had returned itself, and to demonstrate technology for military flights to inspect hostile satellites.|$|E

5|$|By September 1943, {{the values}} of the D-D and T-D had been revised upwards, raising hopes that a fusion {{reaction}} could be started at lower temperatures. Teller was sufficiently optimistic about the Super, and sufficiently concerned about reports that the Germans were interested in deuterium, to ask the Governing Board <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>its</b> priority. The board agreed to some extent, but ruled that only one person could be spared to work on it full-time. Oppenheimer designated Konopinski, who would {{spend the rest of the}} war working on it. Nonetheless, in February 1944, Teller added Stanislaw Ulam, Jane Roberg, Geoffrey Chew, and Harold and Mary Argo to his T-1 Group. Ulam calculated the inverse Compton cooling, while Roberg worked out the ignition temperature of T-D mixtures. Maria Goeppert joined the group in February 1945.|$|E

By 1824, the canal was giving annual revenues of 850,000 francs.

After seeing the dilapidated rooms of the Zhonghui Building where the museum was then housed, Huang agreed to allocate a prime site on the People's Square, but the museum had <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>its</b> own building funds. Ma raised US$25 million by leasing the old building to a Hong Kong developer. He also made many trips abroad to solicit donations, mainly from the Shanghai diaspora who had fled to Hong Kong after the Communist revolution, raising another US$10 million. The money still ran short, but he eventually persuaded the city government to allocate another 140 million yuan to complete the building.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical studies {{indicate}} that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: the sudden re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a degenerate star or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star's core. In the first instance, a degenerate white dwarf may accumulate sufficient material from a binary companion, either through accretion or via a merger, <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>its</b> core temperature enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star. In the second case, {{the core of a}} massive star may undergo sudden gravitational collapse, releasing gravitational potential energy as a supernova. While some observed supernovae are more complex than these two simplified theories, the astrophysical collapse mechanics have been established and accepted by most astronomers for some time.|$|E
5|$|The SASR {{draws on}} the {{experiences}} of Z Special Unit, M Special Unit, the Independent Companies and the Coastwatchers which operated in the South West Pacific Area against the Japanese during World War II. These units had been disbanded soon after the war {{as part of the}} demobilisation of the Australian military; however, after observing the operations of the British Special Air Service during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s the Australian Army decided <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>its</b> own SAS unit. The 1st Special Air Service Company was established on 25 July 1957 at Swanbourne, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, with a strength of 16 officers and 144 other ranks. In 1960, the company became part of the Royal Australian Regiment (RAR) and was given the responsibility for commando and special forces operations. As part of the pentropic organisation adopted by the Australian Army at the time, the regiment's primary wartime role was divisional-level reconnaissance. On 20 August 1964, the SAS gained regimental status and was expanded to two sabre squadrons and a headquarters, severing the link with the RAR. The raising of a third squadron was approved on 30 April 1965 as part of an overall expansion of the Australian Army.|$|E
