5|$|Beckett {{struggled}} {{in the early}} part of the 2013 season with an 0–5 record and 5.19 ERA in eight starts. He was placed on the disabled list with a groin strain on May 15. While on the disabled list he began to experience numbness and <b>tingling</b> in his hand so he went to see a nerve specialist and expressed doubt as to whether he would be able to pitch again. The Dodgers shut him down from pitching for a month while he underwent a rigorous rehabilitation program in an effort to avoid season-ending surgery. However, the <b>tingling</b> sensation returned when he attempted to resume his throwing program in late June. He was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, which required him to undergo surgery on July 10, 2013 that ended his 2013 season.|$|E
5|$|Shingles, {{also known}} as herpes zoster, {{is a viral disease}} {{characterized}} by a painful skin rash with blisters in a localized area. Typically the rash occurs in a single, wide stripe either on the left or right of the body or face. Two to four days before the rash occurs there may be <b>tingling</b> or local pain in the area.|$|E

50|$|Leigh Ann, Jo Lynn, and Luke head to Mrs. <b>Tingle's</b> {{house that}} night and try to {{convince}} Mrs. <b>Tingle</b> that Leigh Ann is innocent. Mrs. <b>Tingle,</b> however, refuses to listen and hints that she believes them but doesn't care. Luke picks up a loaded crossbow and aims it at Mrs. <b>Tingle,</b> threatening her. A physical struggle ensues, the crossbow goes off, and in the ensuing mêlée Mrs. <b>Tingle</b> is accidentally knocked unconscious. The students panic and tie Mrs. <b>Tingle</b> to her bed. Leigh Ann returns to her house and promises to return in the morning, while Luke and Jo Lynn are left to watch Mrs. <b>Tingle</b> in the bedroom. While under Jo Lynn's watch, Mrs. <b>Tingle</b> regains consciousness and playing on her guilt, Mrs. <b>Tingle</b> feigns dizziness and understanding for the prank and asks to be untied. Jo Lynn proceeds to untie her from the bed, and Mrs. <b>Tingle</b> immediately attacks Jo Lynn and tries to throttle her on the bed. Luke, with loaded crossbow aimed at Mrs. <b>Tingle,</b> convinces her otherwise, and she is retied to her bed, {{this time with a}} gag.|$|R
5|$|Alterations in the {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} can lead to orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing), oily skin and excessive sweating, urinary incontinence, and altered sexual function. Constipation and impaired stomach emptying (gastric dysmotility) can be severe enough to cause discomfort and even endanger health. Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and paresthesia (<b>tingling</b> and numbness). All of these symptoms can occur years before diagnosis of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Its {{toxicity}} {{is due to}} tetrodotoxin, {{which is}} concentrated particularly in the liver, ovaries, intestines and skin. Many species of pufferfish bear this toxin, obtaining it from tetrodotoxin-containing bacteria in their diet. Eating the fish can have fatal consequences. The symptoms of poisoning, which are predominantly neurological, include ataxia, in addition to numbness and/or paraesthesia (<b>tingling)</b> around the mouth, lips, and limb extremities. Cases of pets being poisoned have occurred when the fish have been left where they can eat them.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{is a type}} {{of metal}} poisoning caused by lead in the body. The brain is the most sensitive. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, inability to have children, and <b>tingling</b> in the hands and feet. It causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems. Some of the effects are permanent. In severe cases anemia, seizures, coma, or death may occur.|$|E

5|$|Local {{symptoms}} include immediate and intense pain, followed {{after a few}} minutes (but perhaps by as much as 30 minutes) by swelling and a <b>tingling</b> sensation. Blisters containing blood are not common. The pain may spread within a few hours, along with tenderness and inflammation. Reddish lymphangitic lines and bruising may appear, and the whole limb can become swollen and bruised within 24 hours. Swelling may also spread to the trunk, and with children, throughout the entire body. Necrosis and intracompartmental syndromes are very rare.|$|E
5|$|Paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning (PSP) {{is primarily}} {{caused by the}} consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins by feeding on toxic dinoflagellates, single-celled protists found naturally in the sea and inland waters. Saxitoxin is the most virulent of these. In mild cases, PSP causes <b>tingling,</b> numbness, sickness and diarrhoea. In more severe cases, {{the muscles of the}} chest wall may be affected leading to paralysis and even death. In 1937, researchers in California established the connection between blooms of these phytoplankton and PSP. The biotoxin remains potent even when the shellfish are well-cooked. In the United States, there is a regulatory limit of 80µg/g of saxitoxin equivalent in shellfish meat.|$|E
5|$|The best-studied medical {{treatment}} for intracranial hypertension is acetazolamide (Diamox), which acts by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, and it reduces CSF production by six to 57 percent. It {{can cause the}} symptoms of hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels), which include muscle weakness and <b>tingling</b> in the fingers. Acetazolamide cannot be used in pregnancy, since {{it has been shown}} to cause embryonic abnormalities in animal studies. Also, in human beings it has been shown to cause metabolic acidosis as well as disruptions in the blood electrolyte levels of newborn babies. The diuretic furosemide is sometimes used for a treatment if acetazolamide is not tolerated, but this drug sometimes has little effect on the ICP.|$|E
50|$|Bertmainius <b>tingle,</b> {{also called}} the <b>Tingle</b> {{trapdoor}} spider, is a small basal spider endemic to the <b>tingle</b> and karri forest of southwestern Western Australia. This migid was first recorded in the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tingle's</b> first {{appearance}} in The Wind Waker is in a small, dingy prison cell on Windfall Island. He was imprisoned for being mistaken for a troublemaker. When freed, <b>Tingle</b> gives Link the <b>Tingle</b> Tuner, a device {{that can be used}} if the player connects a Game Boy Advance to the GameCube via the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable. This allows a second player to control <b>Tingle</b> and assist Link by selling him potions, providing him with a shield, allowing him to float and dropping bombs. However, in the Wii U remake, <b>Tingle</b> gives Link the <b>Tingle</b> Bottle, which can be used to post on Miiverse, instead of the <b>Tingle</b> Tuner. <b>Tingle</b> also gives the player a crudely drawn map to <b>Tingle</b> Island, and can be found {{for the rest of the}} game on this island, near the top of <b>Tingle</b> Tower. According to the <b>Tingle</b> Tuner, <b>Tingle</b> is merely a native of a different island with a Tingle-centric legend, in parallel to the Link-centric legend of Outset Island. He deciphers the charts needed to haul the Triforce Shards from the ocean floor. He is also known for his extortionate prices; he demands 398 Rupees per chart, plus 201 Rupees for the IN-credible Chart that shows the location of the Triforce Charts and Triforce Shards from the charts that have been deciphered. This game also introduced his brothers, Ankle and Knuckle, who are twins, and David Jr., who is not related but was (supposedly) saved by <b>Tingle</b> after his ship was sucked into a cyclone.|$|R
5000|$|An {{issue of}} the Japanese {{magazine}} Famitsu published in June 2009 contained a teaser advertisement depicting a tiny picture of <b>Tingle</b> along with a line of text saying Yōsei? (ようせい?, lit. [...] "Fairy?"). On June 12, 2009, Nintendo opened a teaser website, hinting at an upcoming Nintendo DS game starring <b>Tingle.</b> Later, a DSiWare title named Dekisugi <b>Tingle</b> Pack (lit. [...] "Too Much <b>Tingle</b> Pack") was released in Japan on June 24, which {{is a collection of}} <b>Tingle</b> themed applications. Another issue of Famitsu published in late June revealed a Nintendo DS game titled Irodzuki Tincle no Koi no Balloon Trip (lit. [...] "Ripening <b>Tingle's</b> Balloon Trip of Love"), which is a sequel to Freshly-Picked <b>Tingle's</b> Rosy Rupeeland. It was released in Japan on August 6, 2009.|$|R
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome are numbness, <b>tingling,</b> and pain, {{alone or in}} combination. This is followed by weakness of the legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The weakness can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the weakness continues to progress {{for as long as}} four weeks. The muscles of the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves which supply the head and face; this may lead to weakness of the muscles of the face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes weakness of the eye muscles. In 8%, the weakness affects only the legs (paraplegia or paraparesis). Involvement of the muscles that control the bladder and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome continue to be able to walk. Once the weakness has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level ("plateau phase") before improvement occurs. The plateau phase can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful <b>tingling,</b> muscle pain and pain {{in the head and neck}} relating to irritation of the lining of the brain.|$|E
5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as <b>tingling,</b> pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E
5|$|Herpes simplex is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} herpes simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of the}} body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat. Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. <b>Tingling</b> or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E

50|$|The plot of Freshly-Picked <b>Tingle's</b> Rosy Rupeeland follows <b>Tingle's</b> {{transformation}} from a rather ordinary middle-aged man into his green-clothed fairy persona. The story starts when {{one day a}} voice calls <b>Tingle</b> from his home to a spring west of his house. There, Uncle Rupee, {{an old man with}} a Rupee-shaped head, appears and offers <b>Tingle</b> a life in a paradise called Rupeeland if he continues to feed Rupees to the Western Pool. If enough Rupees are fed, the tower found under the pool will grow upwards towards the sky, and <b>Tingle</b> will be able to enter Rupeeland. <b>Tingle</b> accepts the offer and Uncle Rupee transforms him into a giant yellow rupee so that Rupees become his source of life. However, {{near the end of the}} game, the player learns that Uncle Rupee has been deceiving <b>Tingle</b> all along, causing <b>Tingle</b> to battle against him.|$|R
50|$|The trio gathers {{together}} at Mrs. <b>Tingle's</b> house the next morning. Jo Lynn then calls {{the school and}} impersonates Mrs. <b>Tingle</b> calling in sick in order to buy the trio some time, but all are unsure of {{what they should do}} next. Leigh Ann and Luke go to school, leaving Jo Lynn to watch Mrs. <b>Tingle.</b> When they return home, the trio devise a plan to blackmail Mrs. <b>Tingle</b> by using fake photos of Luke and Mrs. <b>Tingle</b> in bed together, suggesting they were having an affair. Meanwhile, Mrs. <b>Tingle</b> plays mind-games with Jo Lynn, planting seeds of jealousy about Leigh Ann's supposed relationship with Luke. Later that day, the plan goes awry when the school's gym teacher, Coach Richard Wenchell, called 'Spanky' by Mrs. <b>Tingle,</b> arrives and is revealed to be having an affair with her. Jo Lynn, again, impersonates Mrs. <b>Tingle</b> and blindfolds Coach Wenchell to hide her identity. When Wenchell passes out after a high intake of alcohol, Leigh Ann, Luke and Jo Lynn decide to blackmail Mrs. <b>Tingle</b> by producing photographic evidence of her love affair with Wenchell.|$|R
5|$|In acute poisoning, typical {{neurological}} {{signs are}} pain, muscle weakness, numbness and <b>tingling,</b> and, rarely, symptoms associated with {{inflammation of the}} brain. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are other acute symptoms. Lead's effects on the mouth include astringency and a metallic taste. Gastrointestinal problems, such as constipation, diarrhea, poor appetite, or weight loss, are common in acute poisoning. Absorption of large amounts of lead over a short time can cause shock (insufficient fluid in the circulatory system) due to loss {{of water from the}} gastrointestinal tract. Hemolysis (the rupture of red blood cells) due to acute poisoning can cause anemia and hemoglobin in the urine. Damage to kidneys can cause changes in urination such as decreased urine output. People who survive acute poisoning often go on to display symptoms of chronic poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Like many boletes, Imperator torosus causes {{gastrointestinal}} {{symptoms such as}} abdominal pain, diarrhoea {{and vomiting}} when eaten raw. These reactions can also happen to some people when the mushroom is eaten cooked, though others have consumed it with no ill effects. In a 1994 study, researchers Ulrich Kiwitt and Hartmut Laatsch looked for the antabuse-like compound coprine in Suillellus luridus and similar species that had been suspected of inducing antabuse-like reactions with alcohol. Coprine ingestion results in heat and flushing in the face, <b>tingling</b> in arms and legs, nausea and vomiting, and increased heart rate within five to ten minutes of consuming alcohol. They found none in the suspect species, but did find indications for it in Imperator torosus. They concluded that the most likely explanation for historical poisoning incidents was a misidentification of I.torosus with Suillellus luridus, though they could {{not rule out the}} latter species containing a hitherto unidentified compound causing alcohol-related reactions. No clinical cases of alcohol-related sensitivity have been recorded for I.torosus.|$|E
5|$|The Rainmen {{entered the}} Finals series without playing a single game in 16 days and were {{defeated}} by Windsor in Game 1, 104–113. Chris Commons led the Express with 33 points and 8 rebounds and Tony Bennett added 25 points. Halifax struggled with fouls {{in the first}} quarter, and point guard Cliff Clinkscales most notably committed three fouls in the first 12 minutes of the game. He would finish the contest with six penalties. By {{the end of the}} game, seven Rainmen players had committed over three personal fouls and the team totaled for 48, allowing Windsor to get 55 free throw attempts. The Express, on the other hand, finished with 32 personal fouls. In the fourth quarter, Halifax's Liam McMorrow took a hard fall to his shoulder and was taken off the court with a stretcher. He would undergo a CT scan and MRI after feeling <b>tingling</b> in the injured area.|$|E

5|$|Long-term use of {{linezolid}} {{has also}} been associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and enduring often irreversible <b>tingling</b> numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. and optic neuropathy, which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed {{by a team of}} researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.|$|E
