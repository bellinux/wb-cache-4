5|$|Commissioned as {{a two-part}} story from Christopher H. Bidmead on 21 November 1984. After {{the news of}} the hiatus, Bidmead was asked by the {{production}} team <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> story but as four 25 minute episodes. It was later adapted as The Hollows of Time by Bidmead for Big Finish as part of their The Lost Stories series in June 2010.|$|E
5|$|Finally, defense {{asked for}} {{adjournment}} {{as a key}} witness fell ill. The court decided <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hearings the next day, after which the hearings would be adjourned until March 4, 2013, in order to hear the defense's witness. Blythe committed to return when the trial resumed.|$|E
5|$|In March 2009, Gillan {{claimed that}} prior to the 1993 reunion of the band, Blackmore had {{requested}} $250,000 be deposited in his bank account in order for him <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> reunion. The {{other members of the}} band did not receive anything. This claim was subsequently denied by Blackmore's solicitor in a statement released soon after.|$|E

5|$|Panzer Dragoon {{received}} positive reviews, both in 1995 and in retrospective coverage. Though {{sales were}} {{not as high as}} Sega expected, possibly due to the success of Sony's PlayStation console over the Saturn, they were substantial enough for Sega to allow the series <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 1996 prequel Panzer Dragoon II Zwei, also released on the Saturn.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiment}} {{started on}} a sour note, however, when an ownership dispute forced Benson to pull San Antonio out on the same evening the franchise was to be formally introduced. Anderson decided <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> venture after Bensons's withdrawal, but made clear {{that he did not}} want to be the only American franchise after 1993.|$|E
5|$|Vasan was {{impressed}} when Kittoo {{told him a}} story based on the chapter. He decided <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> film, and named the heroine Chandralekha. Although the story was developed by Kittoo, it was credited to the entire Gemini story department.|$|E

25|$|Though GM cited cost as a {{deterrent}} <b>to</b> <b>continuing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> EV1, the film interviewed critics contending {{that the cost of}} batteries and electric vehicles would have been reduced significantly if mass production began, due to economies of scale. There is also discussion about electric cars threatening dealer profits since they have so few service requirements—no tuneups, no oil changes, and less brake jobs because of regenerative braking.|$|R
5|$|By 1886 {{the four}} threequarter system had spread {{throughout}} Wales. First instituted by Cardiff RFC in 1884, {{the system was}} designed to allow Cardiff centres Frank Hancock and Tom Williams {{to play at the}} same time, and involved dropping the ninth forward to include a second centre. Newport were reluctant to adopt this style of play, mainly due to Gould's excellent kicking and covering abilities, which allowed the club <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> advantage of the extra forward.|$|E
5|$|Lee Woods {{was tried}} twice, {{after his first}} trial ended in a mistrial due to a juror in her 20s falling ill. Wood's attorney, Samuel J. Karlin, told the judge his client wanted <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ill juror, instead of using an alternate. At his second trial on March 16, 2009, Lee Woods {{was found guilty of}} aggravated murder, {{attempted}} aggravated murder, and 3 charges of gun possession. He was also {{sentenced to life in prison}} without the possibility of parole.|$|E
5|$|On 11 April 1963, Thurmond led Congress in {{an effort}} to fund {{deployment}} of Zeus. In the first closed session of the Senate in twenty years, Zeus was debated and the decision was made <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> planned development of Nike-X with no Zeus deployment. The Army continued the testing program until December 1964 at White Sands Missile Range, and May 1966 at Kwajalein Missile Range.|$|E
40|$|Should polio be {{eradicated}} worldwide, countries {{must decide}} whether <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> vaccinate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> live-attenuated vaccine, <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> vaccinate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> alternative, killed vaccine, or to cease vaccinating. To reap a dividend from polio eradication, countries must choose the last option, but vaccination cessation entails interdependent risks as well as rewards. This article models the polio vaccination cessation game, deriving the conditions that support vaccination cessation as an equilibrium, describing the policies and institutions needed to steer countries toward this equilibrium, and presenting crude quantitative estimates of the gains to supporting this equilibrium.

5|$|On 6 July 2007 Ofcom {{awarded the}} licence {{for the second}} {{national}} ensemble to the 4 Digital Group, who were required to launch its services one year after its licence award. However, on 10 October 2008 the 4 Digital Group pulled its plans for digital radio, including {{the launch of the}} second multiplex. Ofcom held talks with the other remaining shareholders of the 4 Digital Group to see if they were willing <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> launch. In March 2009, Ofcom recommended to the Government that the second national ensemble should be regionalised, formed by the existing regional ensembles.|$|E
5|$|On the {{day before}} the {{installation}} ceremony of the first Chancellor of the University of Surrey, the Aberfan disaster occurred. Alfred Robens, Baron Robens of Woldingham who was appointed the first Chancellor, was also the chairman of the National Coal Board, and as such was expected to visit the site of the disaster. Robens decided instead <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ceremony in Guildford to become Chancellor.|$|E
5|$|The Xindi Council meet {{to discuss}} the {{progress}} of Enterprise. Although the Reptilians and Insectoids want to attack the humans, Degra advises them <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plan to build the superweapon. On Enterprise, Sub-Commander T'Pol continues to help Commander Tucker with Vulcan neuropressure sessions. The ship, seeking the formula for a compound to reinforce its hull against spatial anomalies, then approaches a planet with a vast floating alien bazaar. Captain Archer leads an away team to meet with B'Rat Ud, a chemist who they have met before.|$|E

5|$|The {{grasshopper}} nematode (Mermis nigrescens) {{is a long}} slender worm that infects grasshoppers, {{living in}} the insect's hemocoel. Adult worms lay eggs on plants and the host becomes infected when the foliage is eaten. Spinochordodes tellinii and Paragordius tricuspidatus are parasitic worms that infect grasshoppers and alter the behaviour of their hosts. When the worms are sufficiently developed, the grasshopper is persuaded to leap into a nearby body of water where it drowns, thus enabling the parasite <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> next stage of its life cycle, which takes place in water.|$|E
5|$|Written by Michael Feeney Callan, {{this story}} was {{commissioned}} on 5 February 1985. After {{the news of the}} hiatus, Callan was asked by the production team <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> story but as four 25 minute episodes. It had been planned that an adaptation of this story would appear as part of Big Finish's The Lost Stories range, but fell through due to the author's other commitments and was replaced by The Macros.|$|E
5|$|Britannia {{submitted}} {{an application}} {{to turn the}} fire station into a 227-bed 4-star hotel in June 2010. The Victorian Society praised the proposed conversion. Manchester City Council decided <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> CPO. The city council issued a CPO on 5 August 2010. Despite the plans being approved 16 September 2010, the council continued to pursue a CPO and solicited bids for a development partner in January 2011. Britannia's objection to the CPO led to a public inquiry in April 2011. On 29 November 2011, the Department for Communities and Local Government confirmed the CPO had been rejected. Despite Britannia's guarantee at the inquiry {{to proceed with the}} development it reconsidered its plans. In a letter to English Heritage, Britannia said the proposed scheme was unsustainable for the foreseeable future. Britannia wanted to return to the rejected tower plan. English Heritage and the city council expressed disappointment. The city council offered to buy the building at market value.|$|E

5|$|Following {{a period}} of convalescence, Braithwaite, rather than rejoining the New Zealand Division, resumed service in the British Army with his parent unit, the Royal Welsh Fusiliers. A popular {{commander}} amongst the New Zealanders, rumours circulated in the division that {{his return to the}} British Army was due to his refusal <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 12 October 1917 attack at Passchendaele. Braithwaite returned to the front in February 1918 as a staff officer in a British Corps and was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in June 1918. In October 1918, he was placed in command of the 16th Infantry Brigade when its previous commander, Brigadier General Henry Walker, was wounded in an artillery barrage, and led it through to the armistice. During the course of the First World War he had been mentioned in despatches six times.|$|E
5|$|In August 1999, the {{architect}} informed the project group that the Parliament {{would need to}} be further increased in size by 4,000squaremetres (43,000sqft). A subsequent costing revealed that taking into account the increased floorspace net construction costs had risen to £115m by September 1999. Early in 2000, the SPCB commissioned an independent report by {{the architect}} John Spencely. The report concluded that savings of 20% could be made on the current project and that scrapping the project completely at that stage or moving to another site would entail additional costs of £30m. Spencely also cited poor communication between the SPCB and construction officials as increasingly costly. Given the outcomes of the Spencely report, MSPs voted <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> construction project on the Holyrood site in a debate in the Scottish Parliament on 5 April 2000.|$|E
5|$|Late on Monday 4November, Catesby, John Wright and Bates {{left for}} the Midlands, ready for the planned uprising. That night Fawkes was {{discovered}} guarding the gunpowder in the undercroft beneath the House of Lords. As news of his arrest spread, the next day most of the conspirators still in London fled. Catesby's party, ignorant {{of what was happening}} in London, paused at Dunstable when his horse lost a shoe. When Rookwood caught them up and broke to them the news of Fawkes's arrest, the group, which now included Rookwood, Catesby, Bates, the Wright brothers and Percy, rode toward Dunchurch. At about 6:00pm that evening they reached Catesby's family home at Ashby St Ledgers, where his mother and Robert Wintour were staying. To keep his mother ignorant of their situation, Catesby sent a message asking Wintour to meet him {{at the edge of the}} town. The group continued to Dunchurch, where they met Digby and his hunting party and informed them that the king and Salisbury were dead, thus persuading them <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plan.|$|E
50|$|In 1920, Itchen Pupil Teacher's Centre {{headmaster}} Mr Hemmings {{started up}} the 'Old Students Association'.
