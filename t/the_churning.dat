5|$|Tara is {{described}} {{as the daughter of}} the monkey physician Sushena in the Ramayana, and in later sources, as an apsara (celestial nymph) who rises from <b>the</b> <b>churning</b> of the milky ocean. She marries Vali and bears him a son named Angada. After Vali is presumed dead in a battle with a demon, his brother Sugriva becomes king and appropriates Tara; however, Vali returns and regains Tara and exiles his brother, accusing him of treachery.|$|E
5|$|The Mahabharata (Adi Parva book) {{records that}} Kamadhenu-Surabhi rose from <b>the</b> <b>churning</b> {{of the cosmic}} ocean (Samudra manthan) by the gods and demons to acquire Amrita (ambrosia, elixir of life). As such, she is {{regarded}} the offspring of the gods and demons, created when they churned the cosmic milk ocean and then given to the Saptarishi, the seven great seers. She was ordered by the creator-god Brahma to give milk, and supply it and ghee ("clarified butter") for ritual fire-sacrifices.|$|E
5|$|Hindu scriptures provide diverse {{accounts}} {{of the birth of}} Kamadhenu. While some narrate that she emerged from <b>the</b> <b>churning</b> of the cosmic ocean, others describe her as the daughter of the creator god Daksha, and as the wife of the sage Kashyapa. Still other scriptures narrate that Kamadhenu was in the possession of either Jamadagni or Vashista (both ancient sages), and that kings who tried to steal her from the sage ultimately faced dire consequences for their actions. Kamadhenu plays the important role of providing milk and milk products to be used in her sage-master's oblations; she is also capable of producing fierce warriors to protect him. In addition to dwelling in the sage's hermitage, she is also described as dwelling in Goloka - the realm of the cows - and Patala, the netherworld.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> butter <b>churn</b> {{gave its}} name to <b>the</b> milk <b>churn,</b> early {{examples}} of which were based on butter <b>churns.</b> <b>The</b> milk <b>churn</b> is not, however, used for <b>the</b> act of <b>churning,</b> but rather to transport milk.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> barrel <b>churn</b> {{was also}} used extensively. This type of churn was a barrel turned onto its side with a crank attached. The crank either turned a paddle device inside <b>the</b> <b>churn,</b> as in <b>the</b> paddle <b>churn,</b> or turned <b>the</b> whole barrel, whose action {{converted}} the milk to butter. <b>The</b> barrel <b>churn</b> {{was one of the}} agricultural innovations of 18th century Europe.|$|R
50|$|A {{butter churn}} is a device used to convert cream into butter. This is done through a {{mechanical}} process, frequently via a pole inserted through {{the lid of}} <b>the</b> <b>churn,</b> or via a crank used to turn a rotating device inside <b>the</b> <b>churn.</b>|$|R
5|$|Tropical Depression Sixteen formed {{over the}} {{northern}} Bahamas on September 6. Early on September 7, it organized into Tropical Storm Ophelia, becoming a hurricane the next day. It churned nearly stationary {{for two days}} {{off the coast of}} Florida where significant coastal erosion resulted from <b>the</b> <b>churning</b> waves. On September 12, the storm began moving slowly toward North Carolina, at times nearly stalling and alternating between tropical storm and hurricane intensity. The hurricane did not make landfall, although the western eyewall reached the coastal areas of North Carolina, causing extensive damage in the Outer Banks and around Cape Fear. Ophelia moved north and became extratropical late on September 17 near Nova Scotia, but it continued northeastward, producing strong winds and heavy rain over Atlantic Canada.|$|E
5|$|In the Ramayana, Tara is {{addressed}} by Vali as {{the daughter of}} the vanara physician Sushena. Sometimes, verses are added in the Bala Kanda, the first book of the Ramayana, which describe principal monkeys created by various deities: Vali and Sugriva are described as sons of the king of the gods, Indra and the sun-god Surya respectively; while Tara is described {{as the daughter of}} Brihaspati, the guru of the gods. The 12th century Tamil Ramavataram and the Telugu Ranganatha Ramayanam state that Tara and Ruma rose, along with other apsaras, from the ocean of milk during its churning by the gods and the demons, to acquire the elixir of life (amrita). In the Theyyam drama tradition of Kerala, the gods tire and request Vali to help in <b>the</b> <b>churning.</b> When Vali just starts churning, Tara rises from the ocean and thus is gifted to Vali.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{following}} an appeal for help by Norodom Sihanouk, Angkor Wat was listed in UNESCO's World Heritage in Danger (later removed in 2004) and World Heritage Site {{together with an}} appeal by UNESCO {{to the international community}} to save Angkor. Zoning of the area was set up to protect the Angkor site in 1994, APSARA was established in 1995 to protect and manage the area, and a law to protect Cambodian heritage was passed in 1996. A number of countries such as France, Japan and China are currently involved in various Angkor Wat conservation projects. The German Apsara Conservation Project (GACP) is working to protect the devatas, and other bas-reliefs which decorate the temple, from damage. The organisation's survey found that around 20% of the devatas were in very poor condition, mainly because of natural erosion and deterioration of the stone but in part also due to earlier restoration efforts. Other work involves the repair of collapsed sections of the structure, and prevention of further collapse: the west facade of the upper level, for example, has been buttressed by scaffolding since 2002, while a Japanese team completed restoration of the north library of the outer enclosure in 2005. World Monuments Fund began conservation work on <b>the</b> <b>Churning</b> of the Sea of Milk Gallery in 2008 after several years of studies on its condition. The project restored the traditional Khmer roofing system and removed cement used in earlier restoration attempts that had resulted in salts entering the structure behind the bas-relief, discoloring and damaging the sculpted surfaces. The main phase of work ended in 2012, with the final component being the installation of finials {{on the roof of the}} gallery in 2013.|$|E

25|$|A Vaishnava legend relates Tulsi to the Samudra Manthana, <b>the</b> <b>churning</b> of {{the cosmic}} ocean by the gods and asuras (demons).

25|$|The {{faces on}} the 23m towers {{at the city}} gates, which are later {{additions}} to the main structure, take after those of the Bayon and pose the same problems of interpretation. They may represent the king himself, the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, guardians of the empire's cardinal points, {{or some combination of}} these. A causeway spans the moat in front of each tower: these have a row of devas on the left and asuras on the right, each row holding a naga in the attitude of a tug-of-war. This appears to be a reference to the myth, popular in Angkor, of <b>the</b> <b>Churning</b> of the Sea of Milk. The temple-mountain of the Bayon, or perhaps the gate itself, would then be the pivot around which <b>the</b> <b>churning</b> takes place. The nagas may also represent the transition from the world of men {{to the world of the}} gods (the Bayon), or be guardian figures. The gateways themselves are 3.5 by 7m, and would originally have been closed with wooden doors. The south gate is now by far the most often visited, as it is the main entrance to the city for tourists.|$|E

Upon reaching the summit of <b>the</b> <b>Churning</b> Mists, they encounter an idiosyncratic tribe of moogles who claim the patronage of Hraesvelgr. In exchange for completing dozens of menial tasks, the moogles agree to call for the great wyrm. At their meeting, Ysayle invokes the name of Hraesvelgr's beloved Shiva, but he rebukes her, calling the primal a mockery of Shiva's memory.|$|E
25|$|Colgate and White's {{theory of}} {{supernova}} neutrino production was confirmed in 1987, when neutrinos from supernova 1987A were detected. The water-based detectors Kamiokande II and IMB detected 11 and 8 antineutrinos of thermal origin, respectively, while the scintillator-based Baksan detector found 5 neutrinos (lepton number = 1) of either thermal or electron-capture origin, {{in a burst}} lasting less than 13 seconds. The neutrino signal from the supernova arrived at earth several hours {{before the arrival of}} the first electromagnetic radiation, as expected from the evident fact that the latter emerges along with the shock wave. The exceptionally feeble interaction with normal matter allowed the neutrinos to pass through <b>the</b> <b>churning</b> mass of the exploding star, while the electromagnetic photons were slowed.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{connections}} and similarities between Kali and Alakshmi. First and foremost, Alakshmi’s sister is the consort of Lord Vishnu, who sent his Kalki avatar to earth to defeat Kali. Second, legends say she was born either from <b>the</b> <b>churning</b> of the ocean of milk, the poison from Vasuki (who helped churn the ocean) or the back of Prajapati. As previously mentioned, Kali {{is said to have been}} born from the halahala poison created from churning the ocean or from a lineage created from Lord Brahma’s back. Third, Alakshmi takes the form of an owl. Kali's emblem on his war flag is of an owl. Fourth, whenever Alakshmi enters a house, families fight and turn on one another. The presence of Kali and his family on earth causes mankind to fight and turn on one another. Finally, Alakshmi is said to ride a donkey. Kali also rides a donkey in the Kalki Purana.|$|E

25|$|An earthworm's {{digestive}} system {{consists of a}} mouth, pharynx, esophagus, crop, gizzard, and intestine. The mouth is surrounded by strong lips, which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass, leaves, and weeds, with bits of soil to help chew. The lips break the food down into smaller pieces. In the pharynx, the food is lubricated by mucus secretions for easier passage. The esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay. Temporary storage occurs in the crop where food and calcium carbonate are mixed. The powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt. When <b>the</b> <b>churning</b> is complete, the glands in {{the walls of the}} gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste, which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter. By peristalsis, the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue chemical breakdown. This releases carbohydrates, protein, fat, and various vitamins and minerals for absorption into the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the Kalki Purana describes Kali's lineage starting with the creator-god Brahma, his great-great-grandfather, and ending {{with the birth of}} his children's children. Instead of being born of poison from <b>the</b> <b>churning</b> of the ocean of milk, he {{is the product of a}} long line of incestuous monsters born from Brahma's back. (See Family Lineage below) Kali and his family were created by Brahma to hurry the dissolution of the cosmos after the pralaya period was over. When his family takes human form on earth, they further taint the hearts and minds of mankind to bring about the end of Dvapara Yuga and the {{beginning of}} Kali Yuga. During the first stage of Kali-Yuga, the varnashrama breaks down and God-worship is forsaken by man. All through the second, third, and fourth stages, man forgets the name of god and no longer offers Yajna (offerings) to the Devas. It is at this point when God Vishnu reincarnates as Kalki in the name of the Devas and all of mankind to rid the cosmos of Kali's dark influence.|$|E
