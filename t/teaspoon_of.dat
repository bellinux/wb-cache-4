5|$|Viruses are {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entity in aquatic environments—there are about one million {{of them in a}} <b>teaspoon</b> <b>of</b> seawater—and they are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems. Most of these viruses are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals. They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities and {{this is the most important}} mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine environment. The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by the viruses stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth.|$|E
5|$|A <b>teaspoon</b> <b>of</b> {{seawater}} {{contains about}} 50 million viruses. Most {{of these are}} bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals, and are in fact essential to the regulation of marine and freshwater ecosystems; however, they are also important mortality agents of phytoplankton, {{the base of the}} foodchain in aquatic environments. They infect and destroy bacteria in aquatic microbial communities, and {{are one of the most}} important mechanisms of recycling carbon and nutrient cycling in marine environments. The organic molecules released from the dead bacterial cells stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth, in a process known as the viral shunt. Viral activity may also affect the biological pump, the process whereby carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean.|$|E

5000|$|Frappé is in Greece {{available}} in three degrees of sweetness, {{determined by the}} amount of sugar used. These are: glykós (γλυκός, pronounced , [...] "sweet", 2 <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> coffee and 4 <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> sugar); métrios (μέτριος, [...] "medium", 2 <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> coffee and 2 <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> sugar); and a skétos (σκέτος, [...] "plain", 2 <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> coffee and no sugar). All varieties may be served with evaporated milk (με γάλα [...] ), in which case they may be called in slang φραπόγαλο (frapógalo, , [...] "frappé-milk"), or without. Sometimes, frappé is served without any water (besides the water used in the foam) and milk is used instead. This variation is most commonly found in Cyprus.|$|R
50|$|In Chinese cookbooks, ½ {{tablespoon}} of Western distilled white vinegar is stated to be equivalent in strength to 1 tablespoon Chinkiang vinegar, and recipes which call for 4 <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> red rice vinegar could be substituted with only 3 <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> white vinegar.|$|R
50|$|According to the Food Commission's calculations, {{a single}} serving {{contains}} over 1,250 calories, the equivalent <b>of</b> 22 <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> fat and 11 <b>teaspoons</b> <b>of</b> sugar. However, this assumes a portion size of 1/4 of the pie, {{contrary to the}} recipe which indicates the dish serves 12 adults or 16 children.|$|R

25|$|If commercially {{produced}} oral rehydration {{solutions are}} too expensive or difficult to obtain, solutions can be made. One such recipe calls for 1 liter of boiled water, 1/2 <b>teaspoon</b> <b>of</b> salt, 6 teaspoons of sugar, and added mashed banana for potassium {{and to improve}} taste.|$|E
25|$|Steeping, or brewing, is {{the process}} of making tea, {{generally}} using two grams of tea per 100 ml of water or about 1 <b>teaspoon</b> <b>of</b> green tea per 150 ml cup. Higher-quality teas, like gyokuro, use more tea leaves and are steeped multiple times for short durations.|$|E

25|$|Pure {{sucralose}} {{is sold in}} bulk, but not in quantities {{suitable for}} individual use, although some highly concentrated sucralose–water blends are available online. These concentrates contain one part sucralose for each two parts water. A quarter <b>teaspoon</b> <b>of</b> concentrate substitutes for one cup of sugar. Pure, dry sucralose undergoes some decomposition at elevated temperatures. In solution or blended with maltodextrin, it is slightly more stable. Most products containing sucralose add fillers and additional sweetener to bring the product to the approximate volume and texture of an equivalent amount of sugar.|$|E
25|$|Garlic & Onions* are {{toxic to}} dogs. Onions, Garlic, Chives - {{can cause the}} {{destruction}} of red blood cells known as Heinz body anemia, a form of hemolytic anemia. No clear quantity has been established as to {{the onset of the}} anemia. But for garlic, if your dog consumes the equivalent of 1 <b>teaspoon</b> <b>of</b> garlic for every 10 pounds of their weight (1 teaspoon for a 10-pound dog) it can destroy red blood cells. Poisonous reaction can result from raw, cooked or dried onions, garlic, chives, including those included in powdered or dehydrated forms. Avoid all foods that contain onions or onion variants (such as spaghetti sauce).|$|E

500|$|Closing out the year, My Name Is My Name {{was named}} to {{multiple}} [...] "Best Albums of the Year" [...] lists. It was ranked at number 33 on Rolling Stones list of the 50 best albums of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "The cockier half of the Clipse didn't choose to go solo — he had to after his brother found God. Pusha, in turn, found Kanye West, whose stark and twisted production helped make My Name Is My Name feel like a more lyrically focused companion piece to his own Yeezus. It's the year's sharpest hit of street philosophy." [...] Complex named it the third best album of 2013. They elaborated saying, [...] "everything clicks {{because of the way}} it was calculated. The songs benefit from their respective placement beside each other, each track a background for the next. In that way, it brings the Pusha T fan up to speed with what he's evolved into, without leaving them in unfamiliar territory. If you were the reluctant [...] "we want that old Pusha T" [...] fan, then it fed you the <b>teaspoon</b> <b>of</b> updated classic with the medicine of his reinvention—and by the end, you appreciated both sides." [...] Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly named it the eighth best album of 2013 saying, [...] "With these beats — private-stash stuff from the likes of his label boss Kanye West and Pharrell Williams — he could sell fire in hell. In fact, Pusha plumbs his emotional depths, breaking down his parents' divorce after 35 years of marriage and his conflicted feelings about his brother." [...] Exclaim! named it the second best hip hop album of 2013. XXL named it the fourth best album of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "Song for song, it's tough to put any album in the same category as Pusha's proper solo debut. In the space of a trim 46 minutes, Push coaxed the best verse of Rick Ross' year on [...] "Hold On," [...] made Kendrick Lamar get dark and grim on [...] "Nosetalgia" [...] and even rapped over a beat that seemed impossible to make into a hip-hop track on [...] "King Push," [...] all while keeping his lyricism at the absolute highest level. The worst song on this album could find its way onto a top ten list. If this is what a post-Yeezus world sounds like, sign us up immediately." ...|$|E

2500|$|Oral {{rehydration}} solution (ORS) (a slightly sweetened {{and salty}} water) {{can be used}} to prevent dehydration. Standard home solutions such as salted rice water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given. Home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green coconut water, weak tea (unsweetened), and unsweetened fresh fruit juices can have from half a teaspoon to full <b>teaspoon</b> <b>of</b> salt (from one-and-a-half to three grams) added per liter. Clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given. There are commercial solutions such as Pedialyte, and relief agencies such as UNICEF widely distribute packets of salts and sugar. A WHO publication for physicians recommends a homemade ORS consisting of one liter water with one teaspoon salt (3 grams) and two tablespoons sugar (18 grams) added (approximately the [...] "taste of tears"). Rehydration Project recommends adding the same amount of sugar but only one-half a <b>teaspoon</b> <b>of</b> salt, stating that this more dilute approach is less risky with very little loss of effectiveness. Both agree that drinks with too much sugar or salt can make dehydration worse.|$|E

2500|$|Efamol {{continued}} to ship EPO into the United States and to market its products. In a 1989 article on [...] "health food frauds", the New York Times {{reported on the}} FDA's seizure of [...] "more than $1 million worth" [...] of illegal EPO. The FDA again accused Efamol of marketing the oil [...] "with unsubstantiated claims of treating {{a wide variety of}} illnesses". [...] Efamol's lawyers responded that the product was not dangerous and that it had not made unsubstantiated claims. The American Dietetic Association, representing over 50,000 nutritionists, questioned the value of Horrobin's product since [...] "one-tenth of a <b>teaspoon</b> <b>of</b> ordinary corn oil has as much of the fatty acids as a capsule of Evening Primrose Oil, {{at a fraction of the}} cost". In 1989, the FDA commissioned a report by investigator Stephen Barrett, a medical doctor and consumer protection advocate. Barrett advised the FDA that Horrobin's marketing of Efamol was done in [...] "a transparent attempt to evade the food and drug laws". In a report on the incident published by the consumer information organisation Quackwatch, Barrett also questions Horrobin's research ethics: [...] "Would someone that contemptuous of the law have any qualms about faking data?" ...|$|E
60|$|RECIPE FOR GERMAN COFFEE Take {{a barrel}} of water {{and bring it to}} a boil; rub a chicory berry against a coffee berry, then convey the former into the water. Continue the boiling and {{evaporation}} until the intensity of the flavor and aroma of the coffee and chicory has been diminished to a proper degree; then set aside to cool. Now unharness the remains of a once cow from the plow, insert them in a hydraulic press, and when you shall have acquired a <b>teaspoon</b> <b>of</b> that pale-blue juice which a German superstition regards as milk, modify the malignity of its strength in a bucket of tepid water and ring up the breakfast.
