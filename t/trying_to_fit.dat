5|$|It was Newton's {{conception}} of the universe based upon natural and rationally understandable laws that {{became one of the}} seeds for Enlightenment ideology. Locke and Voltaire applied concepts of natural law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights; the physiocrats and Adam Smith applied natural conceptions of psychology and self-interest to economic systems; and sociologists criticised the current social order for <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> history into natural models of progress. Monboddo and Samuel Clarke resisted elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature.|$|E
5|$|The {{extended}} line {{of research}} that culminated in Astronomia nova (A New Astronomy)—including the first two laws of planetary motion—began with the analysis, under Tycho's direction, of Mars' orbit. Kepler calculated and recalculated various approximations of Mars' orbit using an equant (the mathematical tool that Copernicus had eliminated with his system), eventually creating a model that generally agreed with Tycho's observations to within two arcminutes (the average measurement error). But he was {{not satisfied with the}} complex and still slightly inaccurate result; at certain points the model differed from the data by up to eight arcminutes. The wide array of traditional mathematical astronomy methods having failed him, Kepler set about <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> an ovoid orbit to the data.|$|E

Jules is able to relate well to Glenn, particularly because Glenn seems to have a mother-son bond with her son, Gabriel, as close as Jules has with Travis. Ellie (Christa Miller) is skeptical about Glenn's qualifications, and jealous that Jules now prefers to talk about her problems with Glenn instead of her.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Evans & Sutherland (E) {{decoupled}} their PS300 graphics processor/display, which contained its own display information transformable through a dataflow architecture. Complex graphical objects could be downloaded over a serial line (e.g. 9600, 56K baud) or Ethernet interface and then manipulated without {{impact on the}} host. The architecture was excellent for high performance display but very inconvenient for domain-specific calculations, such as electron-density fitting and energy calculations. Many crystallographers and modellers spent arduous months <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> such activities into this architecture. E designed a card for the PS-300 which had several calculation algorithms using a 100 bit wide finite state machine {{in an attempt to}} simplify this process but it was so difficult to program that it quickly became obsolete.|$|E
25|$|Bucket : This {{pattern is}} similar to the bowl except that one of the planets is in the {{opposite}} hemisphere to all the others. This lone planet, or Singleton, serves as a handle, thus creating a 'bucket' form. The bucket pattern indicates a desire to become associated with activity in the mainstream of society, so that the person feels they belong. However, what this often means is that the person expects the world to discover their own unique talents, rather than them <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> in. They will usually direct their efforts to a single purpose, and strive to achieve objectives rather than act solely for their own self-preservation. The person will probably behave according {{to the nature of the}} Singleton planet that forms the handle of the pattern. This planet will exercise a greater influence than normal in the chart, and will be an important part of the dynamic of the person's activities and basic energy.|$|E

25|$|Aunt Harriet {{was reduced}} to just two cameo {{appearances}} during the third season, due to Madge Blake's poor health {{and the issue of}} <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> so many characters (Batman, Robin, Batgirl, Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Chief O'Hara and a guest villain) into a half hour episode. Another cast change for the final season was replacing Julie Newmar, who had been a popular recurring guest villain as the Catwoman for the first two seasons. Singer-actress Eartha Kitt assumed the role for season three, as Newmar was working on the film Mackenna's Gold at that time, hence she was unable to appear. In the United States, Kitt's performance in the series marked the second mainstream television success of a black female, following Nichelle Nichols as Lt. Uhura in Star Trek and continued breaking the racial boundaries of the time. Kitt's performance as Catwoman would also, later, inspire Halle Berry's portrayal of the character in the 2004 film Catwoman, in which Berry would mimic Kitt's famous purrs. Frank Gorshin, the original actor to play the Riddler, returned for a single appearance after a one-season hiatus, during which John Astin made one appearance in the role.|$|E
500|$|Britain's {{own set of}} {{requirements}} for the AFVG were complicated by the effort of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> the requirements of both the RAF and the Royal Navy onto a single airframe. Accordingly, as a measure to achieve reasonable performance, two {{different versions of the}} AFVG were called for, one being a multirole fighter equipped with pulse-Doppler radar and air-to-air missiles while the other was to be a strike aircraft with limited capability as an interceptor.|$|E

500|$|The Coens {{are known}} for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a {{relatively}} straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls [...] "a pretty savage film". Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.|$|E
500|$|That We Can Play was {{recorded}} {{with a single}} stereo Pro Tools track and [...] "outboard, secondhand vintage synths and sequencers".

Where it gets really complex—and you can't be a slacker—is you have to inventorize all these tiny sounds and constantly be <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> all of these moving parts together and see what sticks—and it's a lot of repetitive, careful-listening kind of work." ...|$|E

[...] AllMusic compared the songs to ambient music by the Aphex Twin, while Exclaim! noted that [...] "Quique follows a similar path as Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient work but with structures that a more rock-based band like Chapterhouse dreamed of matching."

500|$|As a {{consequence}} of the diverging requirements of the RAF and Royal Navy, the aircraft's development had started to stumble. As a result of modifications towards meeting the naval requirements having been performed, by July1963, weight gain had become a considerable issue for the aircraft. By that point, the Royal Navy was expressly criticising the choice of a V/STOL aircraft. By August1963, HSA was openly expressing the view that the range of changes being made to the aircraft was damaging its potential for export sales. At the same time, the Navy stated that it regarded the P.1154 to be a second-rate interceptor, and the RAF openly decried the loss of strike performance. By October1963, the Ministry of Aviation was concerned with the project's progress, and noted that the effort to combine a strike aircraft and a fighter in a single aircraft, and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> that same airframe to both of the services, was [...] "unsound".|$|E
500|$|Renoir said André was [...] "the victim, who, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> into a {{world in}} which he does not belong, fails to respect the rules of the game", and that André thought he could shatter the rules by a world flight, while Christine thought she could do the same by {{following}} her heart. The [...] "rules" [...] of the film's title are its only villain. Renoir said [...] "the world is made up of cliques... Each of these cliques has its customs, its mores, indeed, its own language. To put it simply, each has its rules, and these rules determine the game." [...] Renoir said all human activity is [...] "subject to social protocols that are less apparent than, but just as strict as, those practiced by Louis XIV." [...] Renoir's son Alain said the film continues to be relevant and popular because it shows the artificial joy of the modern age in contrast to the rules of that (or any) age.|$|E
500|$|The Japanese crew, which {{included}} producers Miyamoto, Kensuke Tanabe, Kenji Miki and designer and Metroid co-creator Yoshio Sakamoto, communicated with the Texas-based studio through e-mails, telephone conferences and personal gatherings. The game was originally planned as having third-person perspective gameplay, but after Miyamoto intervened this {{was changed to}} first-person perspective and almost everything already developed was scrapped. The change from third-person perspective was prompted by camera problems experienced by Rare, which was developing the N64 game Jet Force Gemini. According to game director Mark Pacini, Miyamoto [...] "felt that shooting in third person was not very intuitive"; Pacini also said that exploration is easier using first-person. Pacini said that after picking that perspective, the crew decided {{not to make a}} traditional first-person shooter. He said, [...] "We weren't <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> in that genre. We had to break down the stereotypes of what a first-person game is and make a fun Metroid game.|$|E

500|$|Development was {{difficult}} for the team due to its small size and hardware difficulties when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> high-quality artwork onto the PlayStation 2 (PS2), resulting in compromises in the visual quality the team had initially planned for the project. This pressure lasted right up to release, as Ohnishi needed to do emergency work to fix game-breaking bugs. Development was completed in 2006. Vanillaware had great difficulty securing a publisher and the necessary funding for the project, as Kamitani's last project had been the unsuccessful Princess Crown over seven years before. They made unsuccessful pitches to multiple publishers before the title was finally accepted by Atlus, although there was some doubt {{as to whether it}} would prove a success. While the game was completed in 2006, Atlus delayed its release into 2007 as they did not want it to cannibalize the market for their other titles, particularly [...] Odin Sphere was first revealed in February 2007, three months prior to release. Odin Sphere eventually released on May 17, 2007.|$|E
500|$|At this time, {{the priests}} who {{were part of}} St. Peter were doing the best they could to keep the faith alive in their congregation. The priests were smart men who had {{attended}} school in Italy prior to their immigration, but most were unable to speak fluent English. At a time when immigrants were desperately <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> into the American life and be as American as possible, going to a church where the congregation was Italian was not the most desirable choice. [...] Therefore, many Catholic Italians began going to churches and many others changed their religion altogether. Many of these Italians were becoming Protestant. [...] The priests were poorly paid and most lived on about twenty-five cents per day. They had no permanent housing: many slept in the church itself, and preferred the altar floor {{because it was the only}} place in the church that had carpeting. It was also common for the priests to say Mass several churches on the same day. These circuits trips were sometimes as much as twenty-five miles away.|$|E
