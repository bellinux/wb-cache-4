40|$|Olive, var. “Kokërr Madhi I Beratit”is an {{important}} <b>table</b> <b>variety</b> for Albania. Also {{this is one}} of the major difficulties with respect to vegetative propagation from leafy stem cuttings. Leafy stem cuttings of olive cv. “Kokër Madhi i Beratit” were obtained from 1 -year-old olive shoots sampled on 25 April during the 2012 growing season. The shoots were collected at the same height of crown of the tree to avoid the effect of juvenility on root induction. To improve the rooting of olive cuttings, different concentrations of BAP (6 -Benzyl aminopurine), 100 ppm, 150 ppm, 200 ppm and 250 ppm were tested in combination with IBA (Indol Butiric Acid) 4000 ppm. After treatments the stem cuttings were planted in greenhouse equipped with an automatic mist system. At 50 days after the beginning of rooting treatments, cuttings were scored for the presence of callus, percentage of rooted cuttings, root number per cutting and root length. BAP inhibits adventitious root formation, but adding it to IBA in a small ratio (1 : 30 - 1 : 40) improved the rooting. The combination of IBA 4000 ppm + 100 ppm (40 : 1) and IBA 4000 ppm+ 150 ppm BAP modified significantly higher rooting of cuttings. Those combinations of growth stimulators induce also a higher number of roots per cutting in comparison with those treated with IBA alone, but the difference was not verifiabl...|$|E
40|$|The paper reviews cassava {{breeding}} and agronomy research {{carried out by}} MARDI over the 15 -year period, 1984 - 1999. Evaluation of seedling clones derived from sexual seeds introduced from CIAT/Colombia and the Thai-CIAT program has culminated in the release of two varieties: Perintis (in 1988), {{which is a very}} high-yielding variety, and MM 92 (in 1992), which is a six-month variety; both varieties are widely adaptable. The shortcoming of both varieties is their rather low root starch contents compared to the local commercial starch variety, Black Twig. In the pipeline are two new clones: one with potential as a <b>table</b> <b>variety,</b> having low root cyanide content and showing suitability for making oil-fried crisps, a popular snack; the other, having a higher root yield than Black Twig while having a similar starch content. Agronomy research has given attention to: (a) reduction of production costs, (b) maximization of profits, and (c) expansion of cassava production into marginal areas. Strategies to reduce costs include the use of machines in field operations to reduce labor requirements, especially for planting and harvesting; development of a computer software package to diagnose major nutrient insufficiencies and to recommend fertilizer rates instead of using blanket fertilizer rates; decreasing the fertilizer recommendations and frequency of application when growing the early variety MM 92 on drained peat. In order to maximize profits, intercropping with sweet corn and the recycling of starch factory solid wastes as a supplementary fertilizer are advocated. With difficulties in accessing arable land for planting cassava, drained peat was found to be a potential area provided that specific agronomic practices are adopted. Likewise, planting on slopes requires the adoption of certain cultural practices, like the planting of contour grass barriers, to minimize soil erosion and sustain root yields...|$|E

Grape vineyard in Southern Brazil utilize a {{large amount}} of mulch during autumn-winter season demanding extra efforts and costs, being its acquisition very difficult nowadays. In order to evaluate the possibility of replacing the tradicionally mulch by green cover species in the inter-row strip, two experiments were carried out in Indaiatuba and Jundiaí, SP, Brazil, from 1999 / 00 to 2003 / 04, with the <b>table</b> <b>variety</b> Niagara Rosada. The experimental design was a randomized block with four replications and six treatments: 1) no weeded area; 2) cut spontaneous local vegetation; 3) mulch of Brachiaria decumbens; 4) green cover of Avena strigosa from March to October followed by green cover of Mucuna deeringiana from October to March; 5) green cover of Lathyrus sativus from March to October followed by green cover of M. deeringiana from October to March; and 6) Lupinus albus from March to October followed by green cover of M. deeringiana from October to March. The weight, lengh and width of cluster, rachis and berries of grape, the total number of berries and its pedicel diameter were evaluated. The average values were compared by Duncan test at the level of 5 %. The results of all characteristics obtained with the green cover crops were equal or more favorable than those ones using grass mulch cover (B. decumbens), being possible to utilize green manure crops in the inter-rows of grape vineyard without any negative interference on some commercial characteristics of grape fruits...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To enrich {{and improve}} the range of <b>table</b> grape <b>varieties</b> of Ukraine. Methods. Breeding, hybridological, mathematic, visual ones. Results. Modern Ukrainian gene pool of <b>table</b> grape <b>varieties</b> has been created {{on the base of}} the best {{introduced}} and homegrown cultivars and selections. New genotypes that are creating at the National Scientific Centre “Institute of Viticulture and Wine-Making named after V.  Ye. Tairov” under the breeding program “Resistense plus Quality” are the basis of current and future regional assortments for the south and central areas of the steppe zone of Ukraine. The complexity of the origine explains the genetically determined high-level manifestation of commercially valuable characters. New varieties and selections are ecologically safe for humans and the environment, as the level of their resistance to the group of fungal main diseases is not less than 6. 5 points according to the 9 -point scale, therefore they do not require a large pesticide load. New promising <b>table</b> <b>varieties</b> demonstrate a stable yield and high marketability of grapes – 5 – 10 kg per plant with the marketability nearly 80 – 87 % during the last five years. In addition, dense flesh of grapes is a guarantee of high transportability.

40|$|AbstractIt was {{analyzed}} {{the behavior of}} vine varieties with biological resistance in southern climatic conditions of Romania, during 3 years of study. Thus, there were determined: phenology of varieties, fertility and productivity for <b>table</b> <b>varieties</b> and wine varieties, the behavior of these varieties at the attack of the main diseases and phylloxera, physico-mechanical characteristics, the technological attributes of varieties, the physico-chemical characteristics of wines. For determination of the volatile compounds from grapes was used the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method. The vine varieties studied were: Valeria and Muscat de Pölöskei (<b>table</b> vine <b>varieties),</b> Seyval, Valérien and Purpuriu (varieties of wine). In ecopedoclimatic terms from the southern Romania, varieties mature in the ages II-III (Valeria), IV-V (Muscat de Pölöskei, Seyval and Purpuriu) and V-VI (Valérien). From {{the point of view}} of fertility varieties, Valeria and Valérien had the best behavior (over 80 % fertile shoots) and as productivity were noted the varieties Muscat de Pölöskei and Purpuriu with the absolute productivity index of 424, respectively 332 g. Towards the major diseases and phylloxera, the varieties behaved differently, thus, we see that the Valeria variety with an attack grade of 1 % at all diseases and phylloxera and the Seyval variety with an attack grade of 0 % at most diseases but with a significant sensitivity to mold (12 % attack degree).
