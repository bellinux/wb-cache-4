5|$|The most {{successful}} film to open during Super Bowl weekend is the 2008 concert film , which took in $31.1 million, {{almost half the}} total it would earn during a released limited to just that weekend and the following week. In a close second is Dear John, grossing $30.5 million in 2010, for the strongest Super Bowl weekend opening for a conventional release. Both films had strong appeal to female moviegoers, an audience more receptive to moviegoing on a weekend dominated by a sporting event. The 2008 action film Taken, which Cargill noted for its success in appealing to an older audience, took in $24.7 million on its opening weekend {{on its way to}} <b>total</b> <b>receipts</b> of over $100 million, making it a distant third.|$|E

25|$|It {{was agreed}} before the series that {{one half of}} total gate {{receipts}} would be distributed among the players, with the victors receiving the spoils on a winner-takes-all basis. All receipts were put into the bank in a joint account held by the team owners, with no disbursal of funds to take place until one team had won a majority of games in the 7-game series. A similar winner-takes-all allocation of {{the other half of}} the proceeds was made by the respective teams' owners. <b>Total</b> <b>receipts</b> for the series were $13,920.10, from which was first deducted the $100 salaries of the umpires and team travel expenses.

25|$|Because of Paige's strong gate appeal, {{there was}} {{considerable}} demand by outside teams to lease Paige's services to pitch for a single game. With infrequent league games, Wilkinson booked Paige to pitch for small-town teams or other Negro league teams at rates ranging from {{a third of the}} <b>total</b> <b>receipts</b> to a fixed fee $250 to $2,000 per game, plus expenses. Wilkinson purchased a Douglas DC-3 airplane just to ferry Paige around to these outside appearances. Because of the larger gate when Paige pitched, the Monarchs' owners could also insist on a larger share of the receipts from their road games. Wilkinson and Paige each kept a share of the fees. By the early 1940s, Paige's estimated annual earnings were $40,000, which was four times the pay of the average player on the major league New York Yankees and nearly matched the pay of their top star, Joe DiMaggio.|$|E
25|$|Historical tables {{within the}} President's Budget (OMB) provide {{a wide range}} of data on federal {{government}} finances. Many of the data series begin in 1940 and include estimates of the President's Budget for 2009–2014. Additionally, Table 1.1 provides data on receipts, outlays, and surpluses or deficits for 1901–1939 and for earlier multi-year periods. This document is composed of 17 sections, each of which has one or more tables. Each section covers a common theme. Section 1, for example, provides an overview of the budget and off-budget totals; Section 2 provides tables on receipts by source; and Section 3 shows outlays by function. When a section contains several tables, the general rule is to start with tables showing the broadest overview data and then work down to more detailed tables. The purpose of these tables is to present a broad range of historical budgetary data in one convenient reference source and to provide relevant comparisons likely to be most useful. The most common comparisons are in terms of proportions (e.g., each major receipt category as a percentage of <b>total</b> <b>receipts</b> and of the gross domestic product).|$|E
500|$|In 2012, The Devil Inside, a low-budget {{found footage}} horror film {{following}} in the steps of Cloverfield, opened the weekend after New Year's Day. Critics, for whom {{it had not been}} screened, reviewed it harshly if and when they did see it, and audiences reacted angrily to the film's abrupt ending, which directed them to a website for more information. Yet, as Cargill notes, its success was proof that even on that low-potential weekend, a disengaged audience will [...] "throw money at a terrible movie if it looks like it's good." [...] The film's opening weekend take of $33.7 million ranks in the top ten for January. The Devil Inside went on to make over $50 million domestically and almost that much abroad to break $100 million in <b>total</b> <b>receipts.</b>|$|E

500|$|The CBO {{reported}} in several studies that the ACA {{would reduce the}} deficit, and that repealing it would increase the deficit. The 2011 comprehensive CBO estimate projected a net deficit reduction of more than $200 billion during the 2012–2021 period: it calculated the law would result in $604 billion in total outlays offset by $813 billion in <b>total</b> <b>receipts,</b> resulting in a $210 billion net deficit reduction. The CBO separately predicted that {{while most of the}} spending provisions do not begin until 2014, revenue would exceed spending in those subsequent years. The CBO claimed that the bill would [...] "substantially reduce the growth of Medicare's payment rates for most services; impose an excise tax on insurance plans with relatively high premiums; and make various other changes to the federal tax code, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs"—ultimately extending the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 8 years.|$|E
500|$|Bottomley's {{trial began}} on 19 May 1922, before Mr Justice Salter. As {{the case was}} beginning, Bottomley secured the {{agreement}} of the prosecuting counsel, Travers Humphreys, to a 15-minute adjournment each day so that he, Bottomley, could drink a pint of champagne, ostensibly for medicinal purposes. He faced 24 fraud charges, involving amounts totalling £170,000. The prosecution produced evidence that he had regularly used Victory Bonds Club funds to finance business ventures, private debts and his expensive lifestyle. Bottomley, who defended himself, claimed that his legitimate expenses {{in connection with the}} club, and repayments made to Victory Bonds Club members, exceeded <b>total</b> <b>receipts</b> by at least £50,000: [...] "I swear I have never made a penny out of it. I swear before God that I have never fraudulently converted a penny of the Club's money". The weight of evidence suggested otherwise; Salter's summing up, described by a biographer as [...] "masterly; lucid and concise, yet complete", went heavily against Bottomley, and the jury required only 28 minutes to convict him on {{all but one of the}} charges. He was sentenced to seven years' penal servitude. Humphreys commented later: [...] "It was not I that floored him, but Drink".|$|E
500|$|Initially, Pinocchio {{was not a}} box-office success. The {{box office}} returns from the film's initial release were both below Snow White's {{unprecedented}} success and below studio expectations. Of the film's $2.289 million negative cost – twice the cost of Snow White – Disney only recouped $1 million by late 1940, with studio reports of the film's final original box office take varying between $1.4 million and $1.9 million. Animation historian Michael Barrier notes that Pinocchio returned rentals of less than one million by September 1940, and in its first public annual report, Walt Disney Productions charged off a $1 million loss to the film. Barrier relays that a 1947 Pinocchio balance sheet listed <b>total</b> <b>receipts</b> to the studio of $1,423,046.78. This was primarily {{due to the fact}} that World War II and its aftermath had cut off the European and Asian markets overseas, and hindered the international success of Pinocchio and other Disney releases during the early and mid-1940s. Joe Grant recalled Walt Disney being [...] "very, very depressed" [...] about Pinocchio's initial returns at the box office. RKO recorded a loss of $94,000 for the film.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{historian}} Walter LaFeber, Truman {{was known}} to approach defense budgetary requests in the abstract, without regard to defense response requirements {{in the event of}} conflicts with potential enemies. [...] Truman would begin by subtracting from <b>total</b> <b>receipts</b> the amount needed for domestic needs and recurrent operating costs, with any surplus going to the defense budget for that year. [...] From the beginning, Johnson and Truman assumed that the United States' monopoly on the atomic bomb was adequate protection against any and all external threats. [...] Johnson's unwillingness to budget conventional readiness needs for the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps soon caused fierce controversies within the upper ranks of the armed forces. [...] From fiscal year 1948 onwards, the defense department budget was capped at the amount set in FY 1947 ($14.4 billion), and was progressively reduced in succeeding fiscal years until January 1950, when it was reduced yet again to US $13.5 billion.|$|E
