Electrification of atmospheric dust influences the coagulation, wet removal and fall speeds of dust particles. Alignment of dust particles can also occur in fair weather atmospheric electrical conditions if the particles are charged.

Balloon-borne charge and particle instrumentation have been used to investigate the electrical properties of elevated Saharan dust layers. Soundings from the Cape Verde Islands, which experience frequent Saharan dust outbreaks, intercepted several dust layers.

Within the strong-coupling regime, we derive an extended Hubbard model describing {{the dynamics of the}} impurities in terms of polarons, i. e. impurities dressed by a coherent state of Bogoliubov phonons. Using a generalized master equation based on this microscopic model, we show that inelastic and dissipative phonon scattering results in (i) a crossover from coherent to incoherent transport of impurities with increasing BEC temperature and (ii) the emergence of a net atomic current on the lattice tilt changes from ohmic conductance to negative differential conductance within an experimentally accessible parameter regime. This transition is accurately described by an Esaki-Tsu-type relation with the effective relaxation time of the impurities as a temperature-dependent parameter.

We show that remote spins can be entangled in this case even when the intermediary coupling strengths are unequal.

The key to this simplification is the incorporation of prior knowledge {{of the class of}} physical interactions involved in generating the dynamics, which reduces the problem to one of parameter estimation. This allows part of the problem to be tackled using efficient convex methods, which, when coupled with a constraint on some parameters, allows globally optimal estimates for the Krauss operators to be determined from experimental data. Parameterizing the maps provides further advantages: it allows the incorporation of mixed states of the environment, both of which are common physical situations following excitation of the system away from thermal equilibrium. Although the approach is not universal, in cases where it is valid it returns a complete set of positive maps for the dynamical evolution of a quantum system at all times. Citation: Branderhorst, M.

In this paper,we study numerically the ability of a hybrid homodyne detector that combines phase sensitivity and photon-number resolution to set accurate bounds on the entanglement content of two-mode quadrature squeezed states without the need for full state tomography. We show {{that it is possible to}} set tight lower bounds on the entanglement of a family of two-mode degaussified states using only a few measurements.

We show how to use superlattices to engineer many-body entangled states resilient to collective dephasing noise.

Assuming a weak coupling of the impurity atoms to the BEC, we derive a quantum master equation (QME) for the lattice system. In the special case of fixed impurities with two internal states the atoms represent a quantum register and the QME reproduces the exact evolution of the qubits. We characterize the qubit dephasing which is caused by the interspecies coupling and show that the effect of sub- and super-decoherence is observable for realistic experimental parameters. Furthermore, the BEC phonons mediate an attractive interaction between the impurities, which has an important impact on their spatial distribution. If the lattice atoms are allowed to move, there occurs a sharp transition with the impurities aggregating in a macroscopic cluster at experimentally achievable temperatures.

We perform here a {{detailed study of}} the three principal exciton-mediated decoherence channels for optically controlled electron spin qubits in coupled quantum dots: radiative decay of the excitonic state, exciton-phonon interactions, and Landau-Zener transitions between laser-dressed states. We consider a scheme for producing an entangling controlled-phase gate {{on a pair of}} coupled spins which, in its simplest dynamic form, renders the system subject to fast decoherence rates associated with exciton creation during the gating operation. In contrast, we show that an adiabatic approach employing off-resonant laser excitation allows us to suppress all sources of decoherence simultaneously, significantly increasing the fidelity of operations at only a relatively small gating time cost. We find that controlled-phase gates accurate to one part in 10 Â² can realistically be achieved with the adiabatic approach, whereas the conventional dynamic approach does not appear to support a fidelity suitable for scalable quantum computation. Our predictions could be demonstrated experimentally in the near future. Citation: Gauger, E. M., Nazir, A., Benjamin, S. C., Stace, T. M. & Lovett, B. W. (2008).

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for the fast {{generation}} of a quantum register of addressable qubits consisting of ultracold atoms stored in an optical lattice. Starting with a half filled lattice we remove every second lattice barrier by adiabatically switching on a superlattice potential {{which leads to a}} long wavelength lattice in the Mott insulator state with unit filling. The larger periodicity of the resulting lattice could make individual addressing of the atoms via an external laser feasible. We develop a Bose-Hubbard-like model for describing the dynamics of cold atoms in a lattice when doubling the lattice periodicity via the addition of a superlattice potential. The dynamics of the transition from a half filled to a commensurately filled lattice is analysed numerically {{with the help of the}} time evolving block decimation algorithm and analytically using the Kibble-Zurek theory. We show that the timescale for the whole process, i. e. creating the half filled lattice and subsequent doubling of the lattice periodicity, is significantly faster than adiabatic direct quantum-freezing of a superfluid into a Mott insulator for large lattice periods. Our method therefore provides a high-fidelity quantum register of addressable qubits on a fast timescale. Citation: Vaucher, B., Clark, S. R., Dorner, U. & Jaksch, D. (2007).

Within this scheme the spin chain is used repeatedly as an entanglement bus (EB) to create multi-partite entanglement. The noise model we consider comprises of each spin of this EB being exposed to independent local noise which degrades {{the capabilities of the}} EB. Here we concentrate on quantifying its performance as a single-qubit channel and as a mediator of a two-qubit entangling gate, since these are basic operations necessary for graph state generation using the EB. In particular, for the single-qubit case we numerically calculate the average channel fidelity and whether the channel becomes entanglement breaking, i. e. expunges any entanglement the transferred qubit may have with other external qubits. We find that neither local decay nor dephasing noise cause entanglement breaking. This is in contrast to local thermal and depolarizing noise where we determine a critical length and critical noise coupling, respectively, at which entanglement breaking occurs. The critical noise coupling for local depolarizing noise is found to exhibit a power-law dependence on the chain length. For two-qubits we similarly compute the average gate fidelity and whether the ability for this gate to create entanglement is maintained. The concatenation of these noisy gates {{for the construction of a}} five-qubit linear cluster state and a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state indicates that the level of noise that can be tolerated for graph state generation is tightly constrained.
