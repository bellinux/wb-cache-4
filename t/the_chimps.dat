25|$|This {{pavilion}} {{was opened}} in 1989 by Diana, Princess of Wales and Countess of Chester, and {{is home to}} 26 common chimpanzees. This is the largest colony of chimps in Europe, housed in the Roundhouse, a conical indoor enclosure linked to an outside moated island. The island is planted with many bushes and has large poles for <b>the</b> <b>chimps</b> to climb on. The inside area has a climbing frame that allows <b>the</b> <b>chimps</b> to stay close together on several levels of platform. There are seven interconnected off-show dens.|$|E
25|$|A 30-year {{study at}} Kyoto University's Primate Research Institute {{has shown that}} chimps are able to learn to {{recognise}} the numbers 1 through 9 and their values. <b>The</b> <b>chimps</b> further show an aptitude for photographic memory, demonstrated in experiments in which the jumbled digits are flashed onto a computer screen {{for less than a}} quarter of a second. One chimp, Ayumu, was able to correctly and quickly point to the positions where they appeared in ascending order. The same experiment was failed by human world memory champion Ben Pridmore on most attempts.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, {{to prepare}} for {{research}} on AIDS, the U.S. bred them aggressively, with 315 breeding chimpanzees used to produce 400 offspring. By 1996, {{it was clear that}} SIV/HIV-2/SHIV in macaque monkeys was a preferred scientific AIDS model to <b>the</b> <b>chimps,</b> which meant there was a surplus. A five-year moratorium on breeding was therefore imposed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) that year, and it has been extended annually since 2001. As of October 2006, the chimp population in US laboratories had declined to 1133 from a peak of 1500 in 1996.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the peaceful and affectionate behaviours she observed, Goodall also found an aggressive side of chimpanzee nature at Gombe Stream. She discovered that chimps will systematically hunt and eat smaller primates such as colobus monkeys. Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a colobus monkey high in a tree, block all possible exits, then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus. The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing {{with other members of}} the troop in response to begging behaviours. <b>The</b> <b>chimps</b> at Gombe kill and eat as much as one-third of the colobus population in the park each year. This alone was a major scientific find which challenged previous conceptions of chimpanzee diet and behaviour.|$|E

[...] During a vigorous tribal dance, Homer manages to enrage a hippo. It chases after the family, but they escape by using a tribal shield as a raft going down a raging river. After surviving the plunge over Victoria Falls, the family stumble upon a chimpanzee sanctuary maintained by the scientist Dr. Joan Bushwell (a parody of Jane Goodall).

The RZSS {{is the principal}} sponsor {{in the long term}} study and conservation of a group of approximately 60 chimpanzees as part of the Budongo Conservation Field Station in Uganda, Africa. Amidst the opening of Budongo Trail, Jane Goodall described it as a [...] "wonderful facility" [...] where primates [...] "are probably better off [...] living in the wild in an area like Budongo , where one in six gets caught in a wire snare, and countries like Congo, where chimpanzees, monkeys and gorillas are shot for food commercially." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, Gordon Gallup, Jr., {{experimentally}} {{investigated the}} possibility of self-recognition with two male and two female wild pre-adolescent chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), none of which had presumably seen a mirror previously. Each chimpanzee was put into a room by itself for two days. Next, a full-length mirror {{was placed in the}} room for a total of 80 hours at periodically decreasing distances. A multitude of behaviours was recorded upon introducing the mirrors to the chimpanzees. [...] Initially, the chimpanzees made threatening gestures at their own images, ostensibly seeing their own reflections as threatening. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>chimps</b> used their own reflections for self-directed responding behaviours, such as grooming parts of their body previously not observed without a mirror, picking their noses, making faces, and blowing bubbles at their own reflections.|$|E
2500|$|Goodall's {{research}} at Gombe Stream {{is best known}} to the scientific community for challenging two long-standing beliefs of the day: that only humans could construct and use tools, and that chimpanzees were vegetarians. While observing one chimpanzee feeding at a termite mound, she watched him repeatedly place stalks of grass into termite holes, then remove them from the hole covered with clinging termites, effectively “fishing” for termites. <b>The</b> <b>chimps</b> would also take twigs from trees and strip off the leaves to make the twig more effective, a form of object modification which is the rudimentary beginnings of toolmaking. Humans had long distinguished ourselves {{from the rest of}} the animal kingdom as [...] "Man the Toolmaker". In response to Goodall's revolutionary findings, Louis Leakey wrote, [...] "We must now redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as human!".|$|E

2500|$|Emulation {{learning}} and imitative learning {{are two different}} adaptations {{that can only be}} assessed in their larger environmental and evolutionary contexts. In one experiment, chimpanzees and two-year-old children were separately presented with a rake-like-tool and an out-of-reach object. [...] Adult humans then demonstrated two different ways to use the tool, one more efficient, one less efficient. Chimpanzees used the same efficient method following both demonstrations, regardless of what was demonstrated. Most of the human children, however, imitated whichever method the adult was demonstrating. If <b>the</b> <b>chimps</b> and humans were to be compared {{on the basis of these}} results, one might think that chimpanzees are more intelligent. From an evolutionary perspective they are equally intelligent, but with different kinds of intelligence adapted to different environments. Chimpanzee learning strategies are well-suited to a stable physical environment that requires little social cooperation (compared to humans). Human learning strategies are well-suited to a more complex social environment in which understanding the intentions of others may be more important than success at a specific task. [...] Tomasello argues that this strategy has made possible the [...] "ratchet effect" [...] that enabled humans to evolve complex social systems that have enabled humans to adapt to virtually every physical environment on the surface of the earth.|$|E
2500|$|In 1888, Swiss {{psychiatrist}} Gottlieb Burckhardt {{performed the}} first medically sanctioned psychosurgery {{in which the}} cerebral cortex was excised. [...] Although some patients showed improvement of symptoms and became more subdued, one patient died and several developed aphasia or seizure disorders. [...] Burckhardt {{would go on to}} publish his clinical outcomes in a scholarly paper. [...] This procedure was met with criticism from the medical community and his academic and surgical endeavors were largely ignored. In the late 1930s, Egas Moniz conceived the leucotomy (AKA prefrontal lobotomy) in which the fibers connecting the frontal lobes {{to the rest of the}} brain were severed. [...] Moniz’s primary inspiration stemmed from a demonstration by neuroscientists John Fulton and Carlyle’s 1935 experiment in which two chimpanzees were given leucotomies and pre and post surgical behavior was compared. [...] Prior to the leucotomy, <b>the</b> <b>chimps</b> engaged in typical behavior including throwing feces and fighting. [...] After the procedure, both chimps were pacified and less violent. [...] During the Q, Moniz asked if such a procedure could be extended to human subjects, a question that Fulton admitted was quite startling. Moniz would go on to extend the controversial practice to humans suffering from various psychotic disorders, an endeavor for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1949. [...] Between the late 1930s and early 1970s, the leucotomy was a widely accepted practice, often performed in non-sterile environments such as small outpatient clinics and patient homes. [...] Psychosurgery remained standard practice until the discovery of antipsychotic pharmacology in the 1950s.|$|E
