25|$|On 1 June, a {{video was}} {{released}} by the Palestinian Army of Islam {{saying that it was}} holding Johnston. Johnston appeared in the video and said that he had been treated well and was in good health, but it is unclear when the video was taken, and whether he was forced <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did under duress.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} month, Melkite Patriarch Maximos IV declared that, while [...] "Archbishop Zoghby, {{like all}} Fathers of the council, enjoys full freedom <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thinks ... speaks only for himself personally. With {{respect to the}} heart of the problem, the Church must hold fast to the indissolubility of marriage." ...|$|E
500|$|For the {{remainder}} of his speech, Colbert joked about other people in the audience, including Peter Pace, Antonin Scalia, John McCain, and Joe Wilson. During this section, he made another reference to global warming while talking about interviewing Jesse Jackson: [...] "You can ask him anything, but he's going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants, at the pace that he wants. It's like boxing a glacier. Enjoy that metaphor, by the way, because your grandchildren will have no idea what a glacier is." ...|$|E
6000|$|Strether devoted no time <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would be; THAT, visibly, {{would take}} them far. If {{there was nothing for}} it but to repeat, however, {{repetition}} was no mistake. [...] "You owe her everything--very much more than she can ever owe you. You've in other words duties to her, of the most positive sort; and I don't see what other duties--as the others are presented to you--can be held to go before them." ...|$|R
5000|$|Wole Daramola as Mozambique (season 2): A loyal {{member of}} The Veil, Mozambique hides a {{brilliant}} mind behind {{a mountain of}} muscle. It’s hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he’s</b> devoted <b>to</b> more - the movement, or Betty. He remains Betty and XIII's loyal companion during their time as fugitives following the Synequanon bombing. He is willingly killed by XIII during single combat after the group is imprisoned by Xu Corporation, to give the others a chance at freedom.|$|R

500|$|Presley {{undertook}} three brief tours {{during the}} year, continuing {{to generate a}} crazed audience response. A Detroit newspaper suggested that [...] "the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed." [...] Villanova students pelted him with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver, the crowd rioted {{after the end of}} the show, destroying the stage. Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenaged girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as [...] "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious.... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons.... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore." [...] Asked for a response, Presley said, [...] "I admire the man. He has a right <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it.... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|Mateiu Caragiale's {{personal}} life has for long attracted {{interest for the}} traces it left in his literary work. This is enhanced by his reputation for being a secretive man. In a late interview, Cella Delavrancea described him as [...] "made up of [...] small patches, so well sewn together that one never knew what he had said, what he had meant <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is thinking." [...] While Ionel Gherea suspected that Caragiale was merely acting, Eugen Lovinescu, who described Caragiale's personality as [...] "bizarre", also referred to him as [...] "colorful and sterile." [...] Despite his hectic lifestyle, Caragiale feared poverty and lashed out at Bohemianism, stressing that [...] "it kills, and many times not just figuratively". In tandem, fragments of his writings and private records are thought by cultural historian Andrei Oișteanu to show intimate familiarity with substance abuse and the drug subculture of his age, {{in addition to his}} self admitted binge drinking. During his final years of life, he was harvesting an unspecified wild herb from the hills of Cotroceni neighborhood, and using it as a sedative. By then, essayist Ion Vartic notes, Caragiale's obsession with death had developed into [...] "neurosis".|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{there is}} not a shadow of {{evidence}} against you," [...] he objected. [...] "The man alone could supply any, and if he recovers sufficiently <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would <b>say</b> would exonerate you." ...|$|R
6000|$|When Jack put {{his hand}} on the latch, Teddy gasped once--he was {{incapable}} of more! The vision of the poor Indian woman rose before his mental eye, and he--well, it's of no use <b>to</b> attempt <b>saying</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought or felt! ...|$|R
2500|$|Deleuze's {{peculiar}} {{readings of}} the history of philosophy stem from this unusual epistemological perspective. To read a philosopher is no longer to aim at finding a single, correct interpretation, but is instead to present a philosopher's attempt to grapple with the problematic nature of reality. [...] "Philosophers introduce new concepts, they explain them, but they don't tell us, not completely anyway, the problems to which those concepts are a response. [...] The history of philosophy, rather than repeating what a philosopher says, has <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> must have taken for granted, what he didn't say but is nonetheless present in what he did say." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, Panufnik visited Soviet Union {{as part of}} a Polish {{delegation}} to study Soviet teaching methods. [...] He met Dmitri Shostakovich, whom he had befriended at previous conferences, and Aram Khachaturian. During conversations with lesser composers, Panufnik was pressed <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was working on. Having to say something acceptable, he casually mentioned that he had an idea for a Symphony of Peace. This was seized upon, and on returning to Poland he was granted a stay in quiet surroundings so that he could finish the piece (Panufnik interpreted this as an order to complete it). He wrote a three movement work, ending with a setting of words by his friend, the poet Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz. Panufnik hoped to work his own conception of peace into the composition, rather than the official Soviet ideology. The piece was not a success with the authorities.|$|E
2500|$|The reunion {{between the}} Doctor and Rose in the 2008 episode [...] "The Stolen Earth" [...] is stated by {{executive}} producer Russell T Davies in Doctor Who Confidential to be {{a parody of}} romantic film conventions, because the heightened emotional content is abruptly interrupted by the Doctor being shot by a Dalek. In the next episode, [...] "Journey's End", Rose challenges the Doctor <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> didn't get to say before, to which he replies, [...] "Does it need saying?" [...] His half-human duplicate, however, does whisper it into Rose's ear, {{and the two of}} them kiss; Rose gets an emphatically romantic resolution to her romance storyline, as the duplicate-Doctor and Rose continue to live together on a parallel Earth. Gardner commented in Confidential that although the audience cannot hear, it is obvious that he is saying [...] "I love you". David Tennant stated that Rose was the Doctor's girlfriend, though it was never explicitly stated on screen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{what do you}} mean?" [...] demanded Victor Putnam, and now {{his voice}} grew stern. Many a boy would have flinched, but Tom had {{determined}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> just <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought of Crabtree, and he stood his ground.|$|R

2500|$|Following the {{dismissal}} of manager Sam Allardyce, Keegan made a sensational, unexpected return to Newcastle United on 16 January 2008. Thousands of Newcastle United fans attended St James' Park to welcome the manager back to the club as he arrived to see the FA Cup third round replay against Stoke City alongside owner Mike Ashley and chairman Chris Mort. He managed his first game at the club since 1997 against Bolton Wanderers on 19 January 2008. He awarded the club captaincy to Michael Owen, stating, [...] "He's not scared to give his opinion when he's right, and he's not scared <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> feels. He's a tremendous professional, and he trains properly every day." [...] Keegan announced on 22 January that he and Alan Shearer held talks about the two linking up with Shearer as his assistant, but decided against the idea, leaving {{the door open for}} him to take other roles he was interested in.|$|E
2500|$|Noble had {{not done}} any acting work on TV until the summer of 2013 when he {{appeared}} opposite Ian Smith as a gay lover in the Australian TV series [...] "It's a date", or radio, as he prefers stand-up for giving him the freedom <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants without being influenced by a script or crew. Nevertheless, he has made many TV appearances, which mainly {{take the form of}} interviews and panel game participation. In the UK, he has appeared on BBC's Johnny Vaughan Tonight and Friday Night with Jonathan Ross. Noble has also made 16 appearances, the highest number of appearances of any guest, on BBC One's Have I Got News for You including the first show guest presented by Paul Merton. His most memorable appearance on the show saw him and Paul Merton answer all their questions wrong, and getting no points in the entire show. He was Paul Merton's guest on Room 101, where he wanted to consign to history the likes of Craig David, cartoon animals who wear clothes, people who look like cats, clipboards and [...] Christian rock music. He makes regular contributions to BBC Radio 4's Just a Minute and has also appeared on I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue and presented 4 At The Store. In July 2007, Ross featured, as part of his [...] "In The Company Of...", on the Colin Murray show on BBC Radio 1, and in August 2007 Noble appeared on Steve Wright in the Afternoon on BBC Radio 2.|$|E

5000|$|Lalanne {{knew how}} to command line alone <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{precisely}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> [...] He accomplished that result through multi-stage biting: a continuing process that created, through line variance, every atmospheric element he desired. The rest was left to (occasional) burnishing, drypoint corrections/additions, and plate tone - a critical element to Lalanne.|$|R
