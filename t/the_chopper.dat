5|$|Wheelie and <b>the</b> <b>Chopper</b> Bunch premiered in 1973, {{nearly one}} year after the debut of Speed Buggy, another Hanna-Barbera cartoon with similar themes. Executively {{produced}} by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera's Hanna-Barbera Productions, Charles A. Nichols served as the series' director. Several writers contributed to the series, including Lars Bourne, Len Janson, Chuck Menville, Robert Ogle, and Dalton Sandifer. The show's official theme song was composed by Hoyt Curtin, Barbera, and Hanna. Curtin also served as the series' music composer. Iwao Takamoto, who had previously worked on several series for Hanna-Barbera productions in the past, solely produced Wheelie and <b>the</b> <b>Chopper</b> Bunch.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Hanna-Barbera's Speed Buggy (1973) and Wonder Wheels (1977–78), the three series were commonly grouped together {{due to the}} similarities in plot and characters. Reception-wise, several critics reacted negatively to the violence and portrayal of motorcycles in the series, prompting viewers to write letters to NBC in hopes that the show would be pulled off the air. Wheelie and <b>the</b> <b>Chopper</b> Bunch had a total of 13 episodes, each consisting of 3 segments, or a total of 39 segments. It has since been released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.' Archive Collection on a three disc set.|$|E

5|$|Wheelie and <b>the</b> <b>Chopper</b> Bunch was {{broadcast}} on NBC {{as part of}} their Saturday morning children's lineup between September 7 and November 30, 1974; and before being cancelled, it continued to air regularly on the network until August 30, 1975. The series featured a total of 13 episodes with 3 segments each, bringing a total of 39 segments overall. During its original allocated time slot, the show rivaled The Bugs Bunny Show on ABC and repeats of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! on CBS; it also aired immediately following the animated adaptation of The Addams Family and right before Emergency +4 on NBC.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Elena is {{kidnapped by}} Roman, and Nate reunites with Sully and follows {{him to the}} statue. Encouraged by Navarro, Roman opens the sarcophagus, exposing himself to an {{airborne}} virus.

Nate jumps onto the net carrying the treasure which is connected to the transport chopper while a captive Elena gets the pilot killed, causing it to crash on Navarro's cargo ship. Nate kills the remaining mercenaries and attempts to rescue Elena, only to be attacked by Navarro.

25|$|Rounding a {{bend and}} nearing the East River, the tram {{encountered}} Kong {{hanging from the}} Queensboro Bridge. A police helicopter hovering nearby opened fire on Kong to protect the approaching tram. Kong retaliated, pounding the roof of tram and sending <b>the</b> <b>chopper</b> crashing and exploding into the bridge. Narrowly escaping the attack, the tram finally crossed over the river to Roosevelt Island. A second helicopter hovering nearby shone a bright searchlight directly at the tram, inhibiting the view of what lay ahead. The tram operator urged <b>the</b> <b>chopper</b> {{to turn off the}} light, and in doing so, revealed that Kong had cut the tram off. He proceeded to grab, lift and subsequently drop the tram after being fired upon by the circling police helicopter. After narrowly escaping the enraged beast for a second time, small television monitors lowered from the tram's ceiling and guests watched themselves on the ride as part of a breaking news report as the tram safely made its way into the Roosevelt Island station. Although Kong was never actually defeated, the news report indicated that he was making his way away from New York City, thereby alleviating the threat.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Step-down AC <b>Chopper</b> (hereby {{referenced}} as "AC Chopper") {{has been}} presented in recent academic papers as a possible solution for reactive compensation. The goal of this project was to investigate and evaluate the topology {{to see if the}} praise could be justified. In addition, this project set a goal to take the research one step further by investigating if the uses of <b>the</b> AC <b>Chopper</b> could be expanded to include active filtering. The ability of <b>the</b> AC <b>Chopper</b> converter to produce harmonic current was investigated. This was the first step in developing <b>the</b> AC <b>Chopper's</b> active filtering functionality. Theorems were developed and simulations were performed with both open and closed loop control. The results show that using <b>the</b> AC <b>Chopper</b> to produce harmonic current is very difficult if not impossible. This is due to intrinsic characteristics of the topology which leads to the converter producing multiple harmonics for a single control input frequency. Hence it was concluded that <b>the</b> AC <b>Chopper</b> is not fit for performing active filtering and that the results do not support continuing any further research on <b>the</b> AC <b>Chopper's</b> filtering capabilities. A prototype of the converter was developed and built to compare the simulations against real observed behavior. The development process has been well documented in this thesis. Open loop control of the prototype was successfully implemented. The results show a good relation between the theory and the measured values. There are certain challenges connected to the realization of <b>the</b> AC <b>Chopper,</b> and <b>the</b> ways of dealing with these challenges have been described herein. The topology was also compared to available technology to evaluate the competitiveness regarding reactive compensation at fundamental frequency. <b>The</b> AC <b>Chopper</b> was not found advantageous compared to the VSI, a modern available solution. The efficiency of <b>the</b> AC <b>Chopper</b> {{has been found to be}} slightly higher in simulation, but this has yet to be validated with tests on real prototypes. In addition to lacking the filtering capabilities, <b>the</b> AC <b>Chopper</b> has other disadvantages including expensive components and greater volume. Together the findings in this report suggests that <b>the</b> AC <b>Chopper</b> should be limited to use in single phase systems for reactive compensation at fundamental frequency in open loop control...|$|R

Since WWOR had passed from the prior corporate owners (RKO General) to MCA, there were still conflicts in the prior audio from broadcast use, as it was not cleared for location-based entertainment use, and the script was stylized for the ride experience. The announcer for the script as the WWOR reporter was provided by voiceover talent Ron Knight, who also provided voice work {{for many of the}} voices of <b>the</b> <b>chopper</b> pilots, radio dispatch, sheriffs and other characters, as well as voice-over work for two of the other premiere attractions, E.T.'s Adventure, and Jaws.

500|$|Along with Speed Buggy and Wonder Wheels, Wheelie and <b>the</b> <b>Chopper</b> Bunch {{was one of}} {{the many}} Hanna-Barbera {{productions}} that incorporated automobiles able to talk and act like humans into animation; these three shows were dubbed together as a [...] "trilogy" [...] by Perlmutter. Additionally, it was listed as [...] "the precursor to the numerous series featuring vehicles as super-heroes" [...] that would arrive on television in both the 1980s and the 1990s. On the 2003 compilation album Cartoon Network: Toon a Rama, the official theme song for Wheelie and <b>the</b> <b>Chopper</b> Bunch was included on the track listing.|$|E
500|$|The series {{takes place}} in a land full of sentient {{automobiles}} and focuses on Wheelie, his girlfriend Rota Ree, and a motorcycle group colloquially known as the [...] "Chopper Bunch". A writer for Cycle World described the premise of the show: [...] "Wheelie, a car, is the hero, and the villains are a bunch of choppers who do everything dirty to get Wheelie, the clean, all-American car." [...] Nearly every episode of the series focused on <b>the</b> <b>Chopper</b> Bunch attempting to outsmart Wheelie despite their continual failed attempts. The show negatively depicted motorcycles and motorcyclists, and <b>the</b> <b>Chopper</b> Bunch typically received consequences for their actions which often involved the police.|$|E
50|$|Those plans {{changed when}} the International Hockey League {{expanded}} eastward {{out of its}} Great Lakes stronghold to move the Fort Wayne Komets to Knickerbocker Arena as <b>the</b> Albany <b>Choppers.</b> By this time, the IHL had firmly established itself as the AHL's equal, and the AHL was unnerved by this encroachment into its Northeastern heartland.
