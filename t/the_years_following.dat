5|$|After the {{practice}} of lynching was suppressed in central Texas, it received little attention from local historians. However, Waco developed a reputation for racism—propagated in part by American history textbooks—to the vexation of the city's white residents. In <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>following</b> the lynching, African Americans often held Waco in disdain, and some viewed the 1953 Waco tornado outbreak as divine retribution. White leaders of Waco took a non-violent approach in response to demonstrations during the Civil Rights Movement, possibly owing to a desire to avoid stigmatizing the city again.|$|E

5|$|Although Chaplin {{remained}} {{politically active}} in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>following</b> {{the failure of}} Monsieur Verdoux, his next film, about a forgotten vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London, was devoid of political themes.

The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.|$|E

In <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>following</b> incorporation, Arlington gained a local bank, a cooperative creamery, a city park, a library, electricity, and telephone service.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the thyroid}} {{concentrates}} iodine, it also concentrates the various radioactive isotopes of iodine produced by nuclear fission. In {{the event of}} large accidental releases of such material into the environment, the uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by the thyroid can, in theory, be blocked by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large surplus of non-radioactive iodine, taken {{in the form of}} potassium iodide tablets. One consequence of the Chernobyl disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>following</b> the accident.|$|E
5|$|Doge Domenico Contarini (10431071) had a {{relatively}} uneventful reign, healing the rift between the Doge and his subjects and regaining territory {{that had been}} lost in the east to the Kingdom of Croatia in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>following</b> the deposition of Otto Orseolo. However, one fact remained: based on their actions {{in the first half of}} the 11th century, the majority of the people of Venice were clearly not in favor of having a royal hereditary class. This reality, coupled with the fresh memories of power-hungry Doges, set the stage for Domenico Selvo.|$|E
