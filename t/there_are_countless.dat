25|$|Tullio phenomenon, {{another of}} the more {{identifiable}} symptoms leading to a positive SCD diagnosis is sound-induced loss of balance. Patients showing this symptom may experience a loss of equilibrium, a feeling of motion sickness or even actual nausea, triggered by normal everyday sounds. Although this {{is often associated with}} loud noises, volume is not necessarily a factor. Patients describe a wide range of sounds that affect balance: the 'rattle' of a plastic bag; a cashier tossing coins into the register; a telephone ringing; a knock at the door; music; the sound of children playing and even the patient's own voice are typical examples of sounds that can cause a loss of balance when this condition is present, although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>countless</b> others. The presence of Tullio may also mean that involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), sometimes rotational, are set off by sound, giving the sufferer the impression that the world is tipping, clockwise or anticlockwise, depending {{on the site of the}} dehiscence. Some patients report this tilt as being as much as 15°. For such persons, a visit to the concert hall or to a noisy playground may seem like being at the epicenter of an earthquake. A change of pressure within the middle ear (for example when flying or nose-blowing) may equally set off a bout of disequilibrium or nystagmus.|$|E
500|$|The first topic covered is Astronomy, in Book II.

He doubts the four (Aristotelian) elements, fire, earth, air and water, but records the seven [...] "planets" [...] including the sun and moon. The earth is a sphere, suspended {{in the middle of}} space. He considers it a weakness to try to find the shape and form of God, or to suppose that such a being would care about human affairs. He mentions eclipses, but considers Hipparchus's almanac grandiose for seeming to know how Nature works. He cites Posidonius's estimate that the moon is 230,000 miles away. He describes comets, noting that only Aristotle has recorded seeing more than one at once.|$|E
500|$|Thief was {{the first}} 3D stealth game for a {{personal}} computer, and its stealth gameplay innovations influenced later games in the genre. The game has been cited as {{the first to use}} light and shadow as a stealth mechanic, and the first to use audio cues, such as the ability to eavesdrop on conversations and alert guards with loud footsteps. The game's use of sound wave propagation, which allowed sounds to travel around corners and through rooms, became widely considered by game developers. Thiefs influence has been recognized in other stealth games, such as Assassin's Creed, Hitman, Splinter Cell, and Tenchu. Marc Laidlaw, writer and designer on Half-Life, said that [...] "Thief is the single most terrifying, immersive, and rewarding game I have played and the one single-player game I continue to replay. [...] <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>countless</b> books I wish I had written; Thief {{is one of the few}} games I wish I had worked on." [...] Laidlaw called Thief his favorite game, an opinion shared by Fallout 3 lead designer Emil Pagliarulo.|$|E

The name tramp art was a contemporary invention and {{had nothing to do with}} the art form as a whole.|$|R
