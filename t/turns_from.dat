5|$|At Lexington Avenue, NY92 {{begins to}} turn to the {{southeast}} as it heads through more residential areas of the city. At East Avenue, a local street just west of Nottingham Senior High School, a center lane begins, enabling left <b>turns</b> <b>from</b> both directions. The route passes north of the school and St. Mary's Cemetery and south of LeMoyne College before exiting the city limits. At this point, maintenance of the route shifts from Syracuse to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Now in DeWitt, NY92 continues past several blocks lined with homes to an intersection with Erie Boulevard, a six-lane divided highway that carries NY5 through eastern Syracuse. The boulevard ends here, however, and NY5 turns to join NY92 eastward along Genesee Street.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 2012, NYSDOT {{announced}} {{a project to}} reconstruct NY149 and its junction with US4 in Fort Ann. The project would upgrade the intersection by doing an overall expansion, requiring the condemnation of one property. This new widening would help make <b>turns</b> <b>from</b> US4 south to NY149 west. The intersection would be repaved and drainage basins on US4 and NY149, which would tie into the system on Clay Hill Road. NYSDOT's website notes that announced that bids of the new project were announced in Fall2013 with construction beginning soon after. The slated date of completion for the $1.3million project would be in Fall2014.|$|E

5|$|Past this interchange, Route 28 becomes West Westfield Avenue {{and crosses}} into Roselle Park, where it {{continues}} through {{a mix of}} residences and commercial establishments, where it crosses over the Raritan Valley Line and intersects with County Route 617 (Faitoute Avenue/Gordon Street) before heading into the downtown area of Roselle Park. Here, the road comes to junctions with County Route 619 (Locust Street) and County Route 627 (Chestnut Street) before heading into residential areas. The route intersects County Route 616 (Linden Road), forming a brief concurrency with that route until the county route turns north onto Galloping Hill Road. At this point, Route 28 enters Elizabeth, where it continues through more urbanized residential areas before crossing Route 439 (Elmora Avenue). After the intersection with Route 439, the route continues past urban residences and business, narrowing into a two-lane undivided road at the intersection with County Route 618 (Magie Avenue). A short distance later, Route 28 ends at an intersection with the southbound direction of Route 27, which <b>turns</b> <b>from</b> Westfield Avenue to head south on Chilton Street.|$|E
5|$|Young {{started the}} season in the second spot in the Padres {{rotation}} between ace Peavy and Maddux. He pitched his first three <b>turns</b> <b>from</b> the second spot in the rotation. On April 18, he missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second spot in the rotation. Young has since been pitching in the third spot in the rotation. The number three spot in the rotation {{is the only one}} that was not scheduled to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 12–15, 2008. Young, thus, did not make a start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation in 2007. On May 21, 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Young was hit in the face by a line-drive from Albert Pujols. Young was sitting on the ground for several minutes but was able to leave the field under his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a laceration on his nose. Later in the same inning, Pujols would also sprain the ankle of Padres catcher Josh Bard while sliding into home plate. Young returned to the mound on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game where Greg Maddux, who had become a Los Angeles Dodger, earned his 354th victory to tie Roger Clemens for eighth on the all-time list.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{eventual}} hit game Family Feud ran against As The World <b>Turns</b> <b>from</b> July 12, 1976, until April 22, 1977, {{it did not}} become a hit for ABC until its move to the mornings. Only when ABC made its first move to a one-hour soap with All My Children did trouble really began for As the World Turns (and Days of our Lives), since ABC kept that serial's starting time at 1:00/noon, meaning that fans of that serial who tuned to NBC or CBS would miss {{the last half of}} that day's storyline (or, contrariwise, would not, if they watched until the mid-program commercial break and then changed channels, pick up the As The World Turns or Days of Our Lives activities from the episode's beginning, since ABC strategically placed its break several minutes after the bottom of the hour). Further, All My Children's emphasis on youth-oriented, sexier story lines provided a sharp contrast to the domestic, almost quaint tone of As the World Turns (and to a lesser degree, the melodramatic, somewhat topical Days). On January 16, 1978, ABC ballooned its decade-old One Life to Live to the 2:00 PM/1:00 PM starting time, compounding the other networks' headaches. These factors helped contribute to the fall of As The World <b>Turns</b> <b>from</b> the top spot in the ratings {{at the end of the}} 1978-79 season. After finishing the previous season tied with Another World for number one in the Nielsens, As the World Turns fell to fourth behind All My Children, General Hospital, and The Young and the Restless.|$|E
25|$|He bowls {{marathon}} spells, yet he {{is usually}} on the attack. His unique bowling action begins with a short run-up, and culminates with an open-chested extremely wristy release from a partly supinated forearm which had him mistaken for a leg-spinner {{early in his career}} by Allan Border. Aside from his stock delivery, the off-break, of which he claimed to have two variations (during a recorded television 'doosra' show off with Mark Nicholas from Channel 4 in 2004), his main deliveries are a fast topspinner which lands on the seam and usually goes straight on, and the doosra, a surprise delivery which <b>turns</b> <b>from</b> leg to off (the opposite direction of his stock delivery) with no easily discernible change of action. Additionally, he would occasionally use one of his several unnamed novelties. His super-flexible wrist makes him especially potent and guarantees him turn on any surface.|$|E
25|$|By summer 1975, CBS began {{considering}} expansions {{of two of}} the Procter & Gamble-owned {{soap operas}} Search for Tomorrow and As the World Turns) to forty-five minutes daily, in response to NBC's expansion of full-hour expansions of Another World and Days of Our Lives some months earlier. The network changed its mind, however, when it realized that to do so would force them to take the thirty minute station break slot at 1:00 p.m. Eastern that affiliates used to air other programming. CBS then decided to simply expand As the World Turns, which was still the top rated soap opera on television, to sixty minutes. Since CBS decided against taking the 1:00 p.m. slot from the affiliates, and the network did not intend to move As the World <b>Turns</b> <b>from</b> its 1:30 p.m. slot, this made the low-rated Edge of Night expendable and CBS told Procter & Gamble it would not be renewing the series.|$|E
