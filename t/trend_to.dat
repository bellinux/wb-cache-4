5|$|Because Eastern European Romani {{communities}} were less organised than Jewish communities, Porajmos {{was not well}} documented.

5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} {{occurs in}} 4.6–8.0 per 1000 {{people with diabetes}} annually. Rates among those with type 1 diabetes are higher with about 4% in United Kingdom developing DKA a year while in Malaysia the condition affects about 25% a year. In the United States, 135,000 hospital admissions occur annually {{as a result of}} DKA, at an estimated cost of $2.4 billion or a quarter to a half the total cost of caring for people with type 1 diabetes. There has been a documented increasing <b>trend</b> <b>to</b> hospital admissions. The risk is increased in those with an ongoing risk factor, such as an eating disorder, and those who cannot afford insulin. About 30% of children with type 1 diabetes receive their diagnosis after an episode of DKA.|$|E
5|$|In the {{southern}} {{half of the}} village, the highway follows a zig-zag routing as it leaves Fayette Street at River Road {{before returning to the}} north at Washington Street one block to the east. While on Washington Street, the route passes over the Cayuga–Seneca Canal and enters the village's center, changing names to Virginia Street in the process. Not far to the north, NY96 heads into Waterloo's central business district, built up around the junction of Virginia and Main (US20 and NY5) Streets. Past Routes5 and20, NY96 continues north as a residential street to the village line, where the route turns to the west with a slight <b>trend</b> <b>to</b> the north. At this point, the scenery surrounding NY96 shifts from house-lined streets to rural countryside once again, an appearance that follows the road to the northwest through the town of Waterloo and across the county line.|$|E
5|$|Wool was New Zealand's major {{agricultural}} export {{during the}} late 19th century. Even {{as late as the}} 1960s it made up over a third of all export revenues, but since then its price has steadily dropped relative to other commodities and wool is no longer profitable for many farmers. In contrast dairy farming increased, with the number of dairy cows doubling between 1990 and 2007, to become New Zealand's largest export earner. In the year to June 2009, dairy products accounted for 21% ($9.1 billion) of total merchandise exports, and the country's largest company, Fonterra, controls almost one-third of the international dairy trade. Other agricultural exports in 2009 were meat 13.2%, wool 6.3%, fruit 3.5% and fishing 3.3%. New Zealand's wine industry has followed a similar <b>trend</b> <b>to</b> dairy, the number of vineyards doubling over the same period, overtaking wool exports {{for the first time in}} 2007.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} the {{estimated}} bite force at the canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for the body mass, found that for placental mammals the bite force at the canines (in newtons/kilogram of body weight) was greatest in the dire wolf (163), followed among the modern canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the African hunting dog (142), the gray wolf (136), the dhole (112), and the dingo (108). The bite force at the carnassials showed a similar <b>trend</b> <b>to</b> the canines. A predator's largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits. The morphology of the dire wolf {{was similar to that}} of its living relatives, and assuming that the dire wolf was a social hunter, then its high bite force relative to living canids suggests that it preyed on relatively large animals. The bite force rating of the bone-consuming spotted hyena (117) challenged the common assumption that high bite force in the canines and the carnassials was necessary to consume bone.|$|E
5|$|After {{its first}} peak in intensity, Nangka {{slightly}} weakened as convection {{along the west}} side of the system was restricted due to the TUTT cell, and the eye became cloud-filled. Decreasing wind shear and increasing sea surface temperatures allowed the intensification <b>trend</b> <b>to</b> resume, and the structure became more symmetric late on July8 as it moved toward the Northern Marianas Islands. A well-defined inner eye re-developed inside of an outer eyewall. On July9, the JTWC upgraded Nangka to a super typhoon, estimating peak 1minute winds of 250km/h (155mph). The JMA also assessed a 10minute peak of 185km/h (115mph). At 06:00UTC on July9, the eye of Nangka passed over the uninhabited island of Alamagan. The typhoon later weakened while turning more to the west due to increased wind shear. The eye became cloud-filled and was no longer visible by July11, although the organization was sustained by good outflow to the south. However, the convection reorganized the next day and the eye reformed. By that time, Nangka was slowing and nearly stationary as the subtropical ridge receded to the east.|$|E
5|$|In John Gould's Handbook to the Birds of Australia, first {{published}} in 1865, he lamented {{the loss of the}} emu from Tasmania, where it had become rare and has since become extinct; he noted that emus were no longer common in the vicinity of Sydney and proposed that the species be given protected status. In the 1930s, emu killings in Western Australia peaked at 57,000, and culls were also mounted in Queensland during this period due to rampant crop damage. In the 1960s, bounties were still being paid in Western Australia for killing emus, but since then, wild emus have been granted formal protection under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Their occurrence range is between , and a 1992 census suggested that their total population was between 630,000 and 725,000. As of 2012, the International Union for Conservation of Nature considers their population <b>trend</b> <b>to</b> be stable and assesses their conservation status as being of least concern. The isolated emu population of the New South Wales North Coast Bioregion and Port Stephens is listed as endangered by the New South Wales Government.|$|E

5|$|Traditional {{values have}} endured the attempt by western {{institutions}} {{to impose a}} positive image of deviant behavior. For instance, {{in spite of the}} removal of homosexuality from the nomenclature of mental disorders, 62.5% of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in the Rostov Region view it as an illness, and up to three quarters view it as immoral behavior. The psychiatrists sustain the ban on gay parades and the use of veiled schemes to lay off openly lesbian and gay persons from schools, child care centers, and other public institutions. The chief psychiatrist of Russia Zurab Kekelidze in his 2013 interview to Dozhd says that a part of the cases of homosexuality is a mental disorder, he counters the remark that the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the list of mental disorders by stating that it is not true. Homosexuality, which is a mental disorder, was continuously defined as such by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia in 2005 when its president Savenko expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the Executive Committee of the American Psychiatric Association to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry due to political pressure from western NGOs and governments, referred the proposal to antipsychiatric actions, and stated that ideological, social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one. In 2014, Savenko changed his mind about homosexuality, and he along with Alexei Perekhov succumb to pressure and, in their joint paper criticized and referred the <b>trend</b> <b>to</b> consider homosexuality as a mental disorder to Soviet mentality.|$|E
5|$|While {{the victors}} were not {{limited by the}} Treaty of Versailles, many of the major naval powers were {{crippled}} after the war. Faced {{with the prospect of}} a naval arms race against the United Kingdom and Japan, which would in turn have led to a possible Pacific war, the United States was keen to conclude the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess, and required Britain to accept parity with the U.S. and to abandon the British alliance with Japan. The Washington treaty was followed by a series of other naval treaties, including the First Geneva Naval Conference (1927), the First London Naval Treaty (1930), the Second Geneva Naval Conference (1932), and finally the Second London Naval Treaty (1936), which all set limits on major warships. These treaties became effectively obsolete on September 1, 1939 at the beginning of World War II, but the ship classifications that had been agreed upon still apply. The treaty limitations meant that fewer new battleships were launched in 1919–39 than in 1905–14. The treaties also inhibited development by putting maximum limits on the weights of ships. Designs like the projected British , the first American , and the Japanese —all of which continued the <b>trend</b> <b>to</b> larger ships with bigger guns and thicker armor—never got off the drawing board. Those designs which were commissioned during this period were referred to as treaty battleships.|$|E
