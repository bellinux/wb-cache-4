40|$|The authors {{find that}} {{incorporating}} tax-favored consumption in models of environmental <b>tax</b> <b>swaps</b> may overturn key results from earlier studies. In particular, a revenue-neutral pollution tax (or auctioned permits) {{can produce a}} substantial"double dividend"by reducing both pollution {{and the costs of}} the tax system. The second dividend arises because the welfare gain from using environmental tax revenues to cut labor taxes is much larger when labor taxes also distort the choice among consumption goods. Indeed, (ignoring environmental benefits), the overall costs of a revenue-neutral pollution tax are negative in the benchmark simulations, at leastfor pollution reductions up to 17 percent, and possibly up to 42 percent. In addition, the authors show that the presence of tax-favored consumption may drastically increase the efficiency gain from using (revenue-neutral) emissions taxes (or auctioned emissions permits) rather than grand-fathered emissions permits.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{distributional}} and e ciency impacts of climate {{policy in the}} context of fiscal consolidation in a dynamic general-equilibrium overlapping generations model of the US economy. The model includes a disaggregated production structure, including energy sector detail and advanced low- or zero-carbon energy technologies, and detail on government taxes and spending. In contrast to revenue-neutral carbon <b>tax</b> <b>swaps,</b> using the carbon revenue for deficit reduction implies a relaxation of future public budgets as debt repayment results in lower interest obligations. While we show that the intergenerational welfare impacts depend importantly on what tax recycling instrument is used, we find that combining debt consolidation with a carbon policy entails the possibility of sustained welfare gains for future generations. We thus argue that combining fiscal and climate policy may o er the chance for positive societal gains (without considering potential benefits from averted climate change). Importantly, this may enhance the political support for revenue-raising climate policies that are framed over the next couples of decades...|$|R

5000|$|Taylor is the {{president}} of the Niskanen Center, a Washington, D.C. based think tank that advocates for market environmentalism and the adoption of a carbon tax system to combat global warming. Before founding the Niskanen Center in 2015, Taylor was a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, where he previously espoused a skeptical position on environmental issues. Taylor's case is notable as an example of a former climate-change skeptic who came to embrace policies to address climate change after researching the scientific consensus behind man-made global warming. During the 1990s and 2000s Taylor made regular media appearances as a global warming skeptic, including on Penn and Teller's show Bullshit as well as a special edition of the John Stossel show devoted to attacking climate science. Taylor changed his prior beliefs because [...] "the scientific evidence became stronger and stronger over time."

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the pros and}} cons of using a carbon tax to help finance corporate tax reform. Revenues from a plausible carbon tax would be large relative to corporate tax revenues and could thus help finance lower corporate tax rates, extension of business tax preferences, or other corporate tax reforms. Done well, such a <b>tax</b> <b>swap</b> could reduce the environmental risks of carbon emissions and improve the efficiency of America’s corporate tax system. But a carbon-for-corporate <b>tax</b> <b>swap</b> poses a significant distributional challenge. A carbon tax would fall disproportionately on low-income families, while a reduction in corporate taxes would disproportionately benefit those with high incomes. Policymakers can offset some of those impacts through other policy measures, such as paying lump-sum tax rebates. But doing so would reduce the swap’s efficiency benefits. Policymakers may also want to use some carbon revenues for deficit reduction. One option would be to aim for revenue neutrality over an initial period, after which a widening spread between growing carbon revenues and relatively stable corporate tax cuts would reduce the deficit...|$|E

40|$|The Paris Agreement’s very ambitious {{mitigation}} goals, notably to ‘pursue efforts’ {{to limit}} warming to 1. 5 °C, imply that climate policy {{will remain a}} national affair for some time. One key obstacle to very ambitious national mitigation is that some policy makers perceive this to be in competition with major goals of fiscal policy, such as public investment or debt reduction. However, climate policy may actually contribute to these other objectives. Importantly, many fiscal implications of substantial carbon prices, which are essential for stringent mitigation targets such as the 1. 5 °C goal, have long been neglected by economic analyses of climate change mitigation. We systematically review recent contributions on interactions between climate policy and public finance, which include many topics beyond the classic `double dividend’ of environmental <b>tax</b> <b>swaps.</b> We can thus identify new conclusions about climate policy designs that may overcome fiscal objections and research gaps. We find that national climate policy often aligns with other objectives, provided that climate policies and fiscal policies are integrated well. A first class of interactions concerns public revenue-raising: carbon pricing can replace distortionary taxes and alleviate international tax competition; climate policy also changes asset values, which impacts the base of non-climate taxes and boosts productive investment. Second, they concern public spending, which needs to be restructured {{as a part of}} climate policy, while carbon pricing revenues may be recycled for public investment. Third, distributional impacts of climate policies include changes to household expenditures, to asset values and to employment; balancing them often requires fiscal policies. Our findings underline that jointly considering climate policy and fiscal policy can help to make substantial mitigation politically feasible. </p...|$|R
40|$|Air quality co-benefits can {{potentially}} reduce {{the costs of}} greenhouse gas mitigation. However, whereas many studies {{of the cost of}} greenhouse gas mitigation model the macroeconomic welfare impacts of mitigation, most studies of air quality co-benefits do not. We employ a U. S. computable general equilibrium economic model previously linked to an air quality modeling system and enhance it to represent the economy-wide welfare impacts of fine particulate matter. We present a first application of this method to explore the efficiency and distributional implications of a Clean Energy Standard (CES) and a Cap and Trade (CAT) program that both reduce CO[subscript 2] emissions by 10 % in 2030 relative to 2006. We find that co-benefits from fine particulate matter reduction (median $ 6; $ 2 to $ 10 /tCO[subscript 2]) completely offset policy costs by 110 % (40 % to 190 %), transforming the net welfare impact of the CAT into a gain of $ 1 (−$ 5 to $ 7) billion 2005 $. For the CES, the corresponding co-benefit (median $ 8; $ 3 to $ 14 /tCO[subscript 2]) is a smaller fraction (median 5 %; 2 % to 9 %) of its higher policy cost. The eastern United States garners 78 % and 71 % of co-benefits for the CES and CAT, respectively. By representing the effects of pollution-related morbidities and mortalities as an impact to labor and the demand for health services, we find that the welfare impact per unit of reduced pollution varies by region. These interregional differences can enhance the preference of some regions, such as Texas, for a CAT over a CES, or switch the calculation of which policy yields higher co-benefits, compared with an approach that uses one valuation for all regions. This framework could be applied to quantify consistent air quality impacts of other pricing instruments, subnational trading programs, or green <b>tax</b> <b>swaps.</b> United States.

40|$|There is a {{considerable}} body of literature that has studied whether or not an adequately designed <b>tax</b> <b>swap,</b> whereby an ecotax is levied and some other tax is reduced while keeping government income constant, may achieve a so-called double dividend, that is, an increase in environmental quality {{and an increase in}} overall efficiency. Arguments in favor and against are abundant. Our position is that the issue should be empirically studied starting from an actual, non-optimal tax system structure and by way of checking the responsiveness of equilibria to revenue neutral tax regimes under alternate scenarios regarding technological substitution. With the use of a CGE model, we find that the most critical elasticity for achieving a double dividend is the substitution elasticity between labor and capital whereas the elasticity that would generate the highest reduction in carbon dioxide emissions is the substitution elasticity among energy goods.

40|$|This paper sheds {{some light}} on the cost and {{benefits}} of unilateral carbon tax initiatives in a small open economy. We use two substantially revised and updated general equilibrium models for Sweden, with different characteristics, to cater for economy-wide repercussions of domestic tax reform. One has many sectors and households, and is particularly suitable for analysis of distributional impacts. It is based on the 1992 input-output table. The second model is based on the 1996 input-out table, has richer specification of energy good substitution and improved tax data. No evidence of a double dividend is found in either model, which is broadly consistent with the literature. "Winners " {{are to be found in}} sectors that are relatively less carbon-intensive, such as pharmaceuticals and certain manufacturing sectors. "Losers " include the pulp & paper industry and other relatively carbon-intensive, but not labor-intensive sectors.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we study}} labour markets, pension systems, {{and the interaction}} between the two. In the second chapter after the introduction we study the effects of fiscal changes in an overlapping-generations model. A labour tax increase reduces welfare more than a consumption tax increase and a <b>tax</b> <b>swap</b> makes all new-born generations better off. However, during transition it opens up a welfare gap between the retired (worse off) and the working (better off). In the third chapter we study the intergenerational effects of unemployment caused by wage rigidity on the accumulation of pension entitlements. We build an overlapping-generations model in which unions set the wages and firms pick employment. The pension system has an effect on steady state outcomes of labour market variables, but pension systems matter less for the transitional dynamics. The fourth chapter analyses euro area Beveridge curves over the past 25 years. We find an outward shift of the aggregate euro area, Spanish and French Beveridge curves since the onset of the crisis, but an inward shift for Germany. Examining the factors underlying the observed developments we find (tentative) evidence for skill, sectoral and geographical mismatch. In the fifth chapter we estimate wage equations to test for changes in the responsiveness of wages to unemployment using euro area panel estimates. Wages are less responsive at high levels of unemployment. Additionally, differences in bargaining position — in particularly differences between unionised vs. non-unionised labour and permanent vs. temporary jobs — explain {{a large part of the}} downward wage rigidity...|$|E
40|$|Alberta’s {{long-term}} fiscal troubles {{stem from}} rapidly growing expenses; {{a trend that}} existed long before the recent onset of flood-related recovery costs. Financial trouble has led to calls for a broad-based sales tax in Alberta, and strong opposition to that proposal. Most proponents favour a revenue-neutral <b>tax</b> <b>swap</b> that would see a sales tax introduced alongside a decrease in income taxes. Such a switch, they say, would lead to greater saving, investment, and result in less volatile government revenues. Those opposed are concerned about shifting costs onto lower- and middle-income Albertans, {{and the loss of}} Alberta’s identity as the only province without a sales tax. We propose a solution that would break the deadlock between {{the two sides of the}} debate. We recommend Alberta introduce an 8 percent HST and lower its personal income tax rate to 8 percent, which would be revenue neutral. By introducing a generous HST credit for low- and middle-income earners, our proposal would also minimize the adverse distributional effects of the HST, while creating a more tax-competitive economy. On January 24, 2013, the Government of Alberta brought together a group of experts to debate potential fiscal solutions to plunging resource revenues and a growing budget deficit. 1 A divide formed among panelists between those who were in favour of introducing a provincial sales tax and those who were against it.

40|$|From 1995 to 2010 Portugal has {{accumulated}} a negative international asset position of 110 percent of GDP. In a developed and aging economy {{the number is}} astonishing and any argument to consider it sustainable must rely on extremely favorable forecasts on growth. Portuguese policy options are reduced in number: no autonomous monetary policy, no currency to devaluate, and limited discretion in changing fiscal deficits and government debt. To start the necessary deleveraging a remaining possible policy is a budget-neutral change of the tax structure that increases private saving and net exports. An increase in the VAT {{and a decrease in}} the employer’s social security contribution tax can achieve the desired outcome in the short run if they are complemented with wage moderation. To obtain a substantial improvement in competitiveness and a large decrease in consumption, the changes in the tax rates have to be large. While a precise quantitative assessment is difficult, the initial increase in the effective VAT rate needed to allow the social security tax to decrease by 16 percentage points (pp) is approximately 10 pp. Such a large increase in the effective VAT rate could be obtained by raising most of the reduced VAT rates to the new general VAT rate of 23 percent. The empirical analysis shows that over time the suggested <b>tax</b> <b>swap</b> could generate surpluses and improve the trade balance. A temporary version of the suggested tax-swap has the attractiveness to achieve a sharper increase in the private saving rate maintaining the short run gains in competitiveness. Finally, the temporary version of the fiscal devaluation could be the basis for an automatic stabilizer to external imbalances within a monetary union. JEL codes:...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} lay out the {{evidence}} for and against increasing the rate and broadening the base of the GST in terms of the GST’s relative efficiency, equity and revenue raising capacity. Overview The Commonwealth Government has run underlying structural deficits for 8 years and the outlook remains rather pessimistic in terms of revenue growth. For the State Governments, spending on health and education and other vital areas is growing faster than GDP; while at the same time, revenues are threatened because of reduced Commonwealth transfers. The GST debate has consequently been brought forward, in part, to find sustainable ways to address the current and potentially worsening structural budget deficits. That being said, it is also part of a wider debate – recently initiated by the Tax Discussion Paper – about ways to examine the efficiency and sustainability of the tax base in Australia given a fixed government revenue target. However, at this stage, a revenue target is yet to be determined and remains a topic of conjecture, as emphasised recently by Paul Keating. The GST debate has divided political opinion. The NSW and South Australian State Premiers Mike Baird and Jay Wetherill have been firmly in favour of a GST increase; while the Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews put forward the proposal of increasing the Medicare levy to cover additional health spending. The Shorten Labor Opposition has come out in opposition to any changes to the GST, suggesting that it would impact lower income households hardest. On 8 February 2016, Prime Minister Malcom Turnbull identified “economic growth and jobs” as key motivations behind any tax reform; suggesting that he was yet to be convinced about suggested benefits from a direct GST and income <b>tax</b> <b>swap.</b> From this, many concluded that the GST was “off the tax reform table. ” 3 Other tax reform and revenue options remain to be decided upon. Bearing this in mind, this paper seeks {{to lay out}} the evidence for and against increasing the rate and broadening the base of the GST in terms of the GST’s relative efficiency, equity and revenue raising capacity. It also lays out the potential spending options if additional revenues were raised from a GST. As a prelude to that discussion this paper outlines the current application of the GST in Australia, particularly in comparison to similarly developed economies. The final chapter of this paper will then compare the GST with other revenue raising options to assess the possible viability of tax reform to address projected structural budget deficits...|$|E
