5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless {{body fluid}} found in <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> <b>and</b> absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in the ventricles of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus or soft tissues around the spine. Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine (DA, a {{contraction}} of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays several {{important roles in}} <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> body. It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L-DOPA, which is synthesized in <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals.|$|E

5|$|A normal {{variation}} in the PRNP gene can modify {{the course of the}} disease by delaying the age of onset and affecting the type of symptoms that develop. This gene produces prion protein, which is active in <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> other tissues and also appears to be involved in transporting copper. A role for the ApoE gene was initially suspected but could not be confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Clearing waste: CSF {{allows for}} the removal of waste {{products}} from <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> <b>and</b> is critical in the brain's lymphatic system. Metabolic waste products diffuse rapidly into the CSF and are removed into the bloodstream as CSF is absorbed.|$|E

5|$|Fluorine-18 {{is often}} found in {{radioactive}} tracers for positron emission tomography, as its half-life of almost two hours is long enough to allow for its transport from production facilities to imaging centers.

5|$|In addition, {{there are}} two other isoforms of the {{catalytic}} subunit of PKA called Cβ and Cγ arising from different genes but have similar functions as Cα.

5|$|Information {{about the}} {{structure}} and function {{of the human brain}} comes from a variety of experimental methods, including animals and humans. Information about brain trauma and stroke has provided information about the function of parts of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> the effects of brain damage. Neuroimaging is used to visualise <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> record brain activity. Electrophysiology is used to measure, record and monitor the electrical activity of the cortex. Measurements may be of local field potentials of cortical areas, or of the activity of a single neuron. An electroencephalogram can record the electrical activity of the cortex using electrodes placed non-invasively on the scalp.|$|E

5|$|Niccolò Massa {{discovered}} in 1536 that the ventricles {{were filled with}} fluid. Archiangelo Piccolomini of Rome {{was the first to}} distinguish between the cerebrum and cerebral cortex. In 1543 Andreas Vesalius published his seven-volume De humani corporis fabrica. The seventh book covered <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> eye, with detailed images of the ventricles, cranial nerves, pituitary gland, meninges, structures of the eye, the vascular supply to <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> spinal cord, and an image of the peripheral nerves. Vesalius rejected the common belief that the ventricles were responsible for brain function, arguing that many animals have a similar ventricular system to humans, but no true intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} most cases of {{epilepsy}} is unknown. Some cases occur {{as the result}} of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of <b>the</b> <b>brain,</b> <b>and</b> birth defects, through a process known as epileptogenesis. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the cortex of the brain. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may be partly done by imaging <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> performing blood tests. Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), but a normal test does not rule out the condition.|$|E

We obtained magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for 21 autistic children and compared them with 21 control MRI scans. The areas of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> stem <b>and</b> cerebellar vermis were measured using midsagittal im-ages. <b>The</b> <b>brain</b> stem <b>and</b> cerebellar vermis lobules VIII to X {{were found to be}} significantly smaller in autistic children. A positive correlation between the size of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> stem <b>and</b> cerebellar vermis was observed in the autistic children. This correlation was not observed in the control children.
