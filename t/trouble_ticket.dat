40|$|Abstract: Telecom service {{providers}} {{are faced with}} an overwhelming flow of alarms, which makes good alarm classification and prioritisation very important. This paper first provides statistical analysis of data collected from a real-world alarm flow and then presents a quantitative characterisation of the alarm situation. Using data from the <b>trouble</b> <b>ticketing</b> system as a reference, we {{examine the relationship between}} mechanical classification of alarms and the human perception of them. Using this knowledge of alarm flow properties and <b>trouble</b> <b>ticketing</b> information, we suggest a neural network-based approach for alarm classification. Tests using live data show that our prototype assigns the same severity as a human expert in 50 % of all cases, compared to 17 % for a naïve approach...|$|R
