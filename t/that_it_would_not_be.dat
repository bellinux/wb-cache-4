5|$|In October 2013, in {{a conference}} to promote the 25th season of the show, {{producer}} Al Jean revealed that a major character would die in this episode. The character would have appeared more than twice in the show, and be voiced by an Emmy Award-winning voice actor who won an Emmy for the role as the character. Later that month, {{following the death of}} Marcia Wallace, it was confirmed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> her character, Edna Krabappel. Voice actor Hank Azaria, whose roles include Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and Moe Szyslak, stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> one of his characters. It was shown at the 2014 Comic-Con <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> Homer, although there is a scene that features Lisa worrying about Homer's health as he struggles with a CPAP mask.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{the general}} {{euphoria}} in Poland – {{the acquisition of}} Teschen was a very popular development – no one {{paid attention to the}} bitter comment of the Czechoslovak general who handed the region over to the incoming Poles. He predicted <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> long before the Poles would themselves be handing Teschen over to the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Another two judges, Justice Brennan and Justice Dawson, dissented, Justice Brennan arguing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{proper for}} judges {{to use their}} power to adjourn trials to put {{pressure}} on the various legal aid agencies to change their decisions.|$|E

5|$|With the Dodgers crowded outfield situation, Kemp was {{the subject}} of much trade {{speculation}} after the season. His agent, Dave Stewart, publicly stated that he expected Kemp to be traded during the off-season. However, Stewart later remarked that the team had assured him <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> making such a trade.|$|E
5|$|In {{a preview}} of the TGS demo, Ryan Geddes of IGN was left excited as to where the game would go after {{completing}} the demo, along with enjoying the improved visuals over Valkyria Chronicles II. Kotaku's Richard Eisenbeis was highly positive about the game, citing is story as a return to form after Valkyria Chronicles II and its gameplay being the best in the series. His main criticisms were its length and gameplay repetition, along with expressing regret <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> localized.|$|E
5|$|Some {{major changes}} were {{introduced}} in a third watercolour painting (№ 238) which he made during the autumn of 1913. This version was given the text En drömsyn. En konung offras för folket ("a dream vision, a king sacrificed for his people"), a text which was possibly added in the hope <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{considered to be an}} attempt at a historically faithful reconstruction.|$|E
50|$|On November 2, 2012, WADA {{confirmed}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{appeal the}} USADA decision.|$|R

25|$|Mearsheimer {{was also}} {{critical}} of Israel's offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip {{that began in}} December 2008. He argued <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> eliminate Hamas's capability to fire missiles and rockets at Israel, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> cause Hamas to end its fight with Israel. In fact, he argued that relations between Israel and the Palestinians were likely to get worse in the years ahead.|$|R
5|$|The {{plan was}} to begin again in 1976, and seed typhoons by flying out of Guam. However, {{political}} issues blocked the plan. The People's Republic of China announced <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> happy if a seeded typhoon changed course and made landfall on its shores, while Japan declared itself {{willing to put up}} with difficulties caused by typhoons because that country got more than half of its rainfall from tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|Another {{tradition}} {{says that}} the Black Stone was originally an angel that had been placed by God in the Garden of Eden to guard Adam. The angel was absent when Adam ate the forbidden fruit and was punished by being turned into a jewel — the Black Stone. God granted it the power of speech and placed it {{at the top of}} Abu Qubays, a mountain in the historic region of Khurasan, before moving the mountain to Mecca. When Ibrahim took the Black Stone from Abu Qubays to build the Kaaba, the mountain asked Ibrahim to intercede with God so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> returned to Khurasan and would stay in Mecca.|$|E
5|$|Casterman {{felt that}} the {{black-and-white}} volumes of The Adventures of Tintin were not selling as well as colour comic books, and thus that the series should be produced in colour. At the same time, Belgium was facing a paper-shortage, with Casterman wishing to cut down the volumes from 120-pages in length to 62. Hergé was initially sceptical, but ultimately agreed to their demands in February 1942. For these new editions, Casterman introduced a four-colour system, although Hergé insisted that colour should remain secondary to line, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> used for shading.|$|E
50|$|In 1991 Coltart {{spoke out}} against {{proposed}} economic liberalisation, arguing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> work without political liberalisation.|$|R
50|$|On May 18, 2009, Fox officially {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{renew the}} show for a third season.|$|R

5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious six o'clock closing. Blamey took {{the position that}} it was the job of the police to enforce the laws, even if they did not support them. Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{the owners}} of One Times Square filed for {{bankruptcy}} protection. In March 1995, One Times Square was sold to the financial services firm Lehman Brothers for $27.5 million. The new owners felt <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> cost-effective to house new tenants in the tower due {{to the cost of}} the extensive renovation required {{in order to make it}} suitable for tenants as compared to the relatively small rental revenue that its limited floor space would have brought in. Instead, they decided to market the tower as a location for advertising to capitalize on its prominent location within the Square. The entire exterior of One Times Square above the ticker was modified to add a grid frame for mounting billboard signs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Katrina 50 {{families}} that were members of Beth Israel left New Orleans, and gave up membership in the congregation. These included Rabbi Schiff and his family. After the flood Beth Israel's board of directors informed Schiff, who had joined they synagogue in April 2002, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to meet its contractual obligations and pay him past December. Schiff {{and his family had}} also lost their home and much of their possessions, and had been living in Memphis. Schiff resigned effective November 1, 2005, citing this loss, and the lack of a functioning Jewish Day School in the area for his children.|$|E

5|$|Maxie sends his henchmen after Danny. Shark {{and another}} gang member trap {{him in an}} alley. Danny knocks out one of his pursuers. Then Shark stabs Danny, but kills himself in the struggle. Ronnie then finds a profusely {{bleeding}} Danny and takes him to her house on a bayou to recover. She asks him to forget her sordid past and pretend to love her. Danny replies <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> difficult and kisses her. Maxie drives up, accompanied by Dummy (Jack Grinnage), a member of Danny's former gang. Maxie fatally shoots Ronnie. Dummy, who had been befriended by Danny, grapples with Maxie; the gun goes off, killing its owner.|$|E
5|$|One further {{proposal}} {{was made to}} rebury Lody in the 1960s. In 1959 the British and German governments agreed to move German war dead who had been buried in various locations around the UK to a new central cemetery at Cannock Chase in Staffordshire. The German War Graves Commission (VDK) asked {{if it would be}} possible to disinter Lody's body and move it to Cannock Chase. By that time, the plot had been reused for further common graves, buried above Lody's body. The VDK was told <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> possible to disinter the other bodies without the permission of the relatives, which would have been an almost impossible task where common graves were concerned. The {{proposal was}} abandoned and Lody's body remains at Plaistow.|$|E
5|$|State Highway 168 {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1931-1932, traveling from Campbellton in Atascosia County northeastward to Floresville in Wilson County before bending further eastward and terminating at SH 81. The proposal {{was listed as}} a conditional designation, meaning <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> maintained by the State Highway Commission. However, in late 1933, the portion from Campbellton to Floresville was cancelled, and SH 168 was rerouted to Pleasanton. As a result, SH 168 was cancelled and transferred to an extended SH 97. On September 26, 1939, SH 87 was designated to a road that followed the general course of present-day SH 168.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent {{forecasts}} {{indicated that}} weather conditions at Kaafjord were changing rapidly, {{and during the}} morning of 11 September Harris judged <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> feasible to launch the bombers from Scotland with confidence that Kaafjord would be free of cloud {{by the time they}} arrived. Accordingly, he decided to change the plans for the operation, with all of the bombers now flying to Yagodnik first and mounting the attack from that airfield. Harris ordered the attack force to depart that afternoon, before advising the Air Ministry or Soviets of the change in plans.|$|E
5|$|The Oakwood City Council {{wanted the}} Playhouse as a {{community}} center. Thomas appeared before the council and assured them <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> damaged, although he could not disclose what he was intending to use it for. When Talbott Realty proved reluctant to sell, the United States Army Corps of Engineers condemned the property, which became Unit IV on 15 February 1944. Remodeling began on 17 March and the Production Group began moving in on 1 June. Three guard houses were added, along with a wire fence. Changes to the site were minimized {{in order to make}} it easier to restore later. Because it was located in a residential area, efforts were also made to minimize noise and other disruptions.|$|E
5|$|Though {{production}} of hammered coinage ceased in France in 1645, edge lettering wasn't immediately reintroduced to that nation's milled coinage. At some point prior to 1679, Jean Castaing, a French engineer, invented a machine to apply edge lettering to coins, and in 1685, {{he approached the}} French government with a proposal to use his machine in that nation's mints. King Louis XIV favoured the invention, but his financial minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, believed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> economically viable to pay the expenses required {{to put it into}} use. In 1686, over Colbert's objection, the French Council of State entered a contract with Castaing wherein all of the nation's gold and silver coinage would include edge lettering created by his machine.|$|E
