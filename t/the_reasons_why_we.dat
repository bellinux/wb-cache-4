2500|$|In October 2009, the Colorado Springs Independent {{published}} the first extensive interview with Haggard {{to appear in}} the secular press since the 2006 scandal. Over the course of a 2½-hour interview, the former pastor talked about the scandal, his agreement never to return to New Life or the state of Colorado, suicidal ideas, and the prospect of starting a new church in Colorado Springs. [...] "Back in the old days," [...] said Haggard, [...] "when somebody would get in trouble, they'd just need to move 40 or 50 miles, or a hundred miles, and they could start again. Not anymore. Which is one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> needed to come home. Because I needed to finish this story from here." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 30 April 1943, Pius XII {{wrote to}} Bishop Graf von Preysing of Berlin to say: [...] "We {{give to the}} pastors who {{are working on the}} local level the duty of {{determining}} if and to what degree the danger of reprisals and of various forms of oppression occasioned by episcopal declarations... ad maiora mala vitanda (to avoid worse)... seem to advise caution. Here lies one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons,</b> <b>why</b> <b>We</b> impose self-restraint on Ourselves in our speeches; the experience, that we made in 1942 with papal addresses, which We authorized to be forwarded to the Believers, justifies our opinion, as far as We see.... The Holy See has done whatever was in its power, with charitable, financial and moral assistance. To say nothing of the substantial sums which we spent in American money for the fares of immigrants." ...|$|E

You don't need anybody to tell you that you have to pay money. So that was one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> did that, and it's just...it's one of those things that, it happened and we took it and, maybe...it was a really easy symbol for kids to spray paint and it's an easy symbol to put on a shirt and, so, it became, maybe, bigger than what it really was in the beginning. It was just, it was something that we liked and we thought that it would piss our parents off or something, you know? And then, when the records came out it just came everywhere, and so then everyone said 'What does that mean? What does that mean?' Whatever you want it to mean, you know...you decide." ...|$|E

60|$|On {{the other}} side, a {{turbulent}} writer of Occasional Letters, and other vexatious papers, in conjunction perhaps {{with one or}} two friends as bad as himself, is able to disconcert, tease, and sour us whenever he thinks fit, merely by the strength of genius and truth; and after so dexterous a manner, that, when we are vexed to the soul, and well know <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> are so, we are ashamed to own the first, and cannot tell how to express the other.

60|$|Ladies and gentlemen--Fortunately for me, and {{fortunately}} for you, {{it is the}} duty of the Chairman on an occasion of this nature, to be very careful that he does not anticipate those speakers who come after him. Like Falstaff, with a considerable difference, he has to be the cause of speaking in others. It is rather his duty to sit and hear speeches with exemplary attention than to stand up to make them; so I shall confine myself, in opening these proceedings as your business official, to as plain and as short an exposition as I can possibly give you of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> come together.|$|E
6000|$|The {{answer is}} simple enough, as Emily Brontë knew. They quarrel. And an {{excellent}} way of passing the time it is; so excellent, indeed, that the pity were better inverted. But we all lack the knowledge of our chiefest needs. In the first place, and mainly, it is hygienic to quarrel, it disengages floods of nervous energy, the pulse quickens, the breathing is accelerated, the digestion improved. Then it sets one's stagnant brains astir and quickens the imagination; it clears the mind of vapours, as thunder clears the air. And, finally, it is a natural function of the body. In his natural state man is always quarrelling--by instinct. Not to quarrel is indeed one of the vices of our civilisation, one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> are neurotic and anæmic, and all these things. And, at last, our enfeebled palates have even lost the capacity for enjoying a [...] "jolly good row." ...|$|E
60|$|So we trekked {{with the}} moon, Gaasha guiding us, {{and did not}} outspan till dawn. As I have said, we had no horses, but never until I made that journey did it come home to me how slow are oxen, for never before then was I in a hurry, nor, indeed, have I been since that time. It is the Englishmen who are always in a hurry, {{and that is one}} of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> Boers are so {{superior}} to them, and when we choose can master them in everything, except shopkeeping, and especially in fighting. Well, at the best the cattle could not drag the waggon over the roadless veldt at a greater rate than two miles an hour, or cover more than twenty miles a day in all. It was pitiful to see Ralph's impatience; again and again he walked on and returned; indeed, had we allowed it, I think that he would have pressed forward on foot, leaving us to follow in the waggon.|$|E

60|$|It {{must have}} been the result of prejudice, and of {{constant}} reading of articles extracted from the English journals, that influenced me; but I confess it seemed a much easier matter to re-take my ship from seventeen Frenchmen, than from twelve Englishmen. I was not so besotted as to suppose surprise, or artifice, would not be necessary in either case; but, had the issue been made up on brute force, I should have begun the fray with greater confidence in the first than in the last case. All this would have been very wrong in our particular situation, though, as a rule and as applied to sea-faring men, it might be more questionable. How often, and how much, have I seen reason to regret the influence that is thus silently obtained amongst us, by our consenting to become the retailers of other people's prejudices! One of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> have so long been mere serviles on this point, is owing to the incompleteness of the establishments of the different leading presses of the country. We multiply, instead of enlarging these enterprises. The want of concentration of talent compels those who manage them to resort to the scissors instead of the pen; and it is almost as necessary for an American editor to be expert with the shears, as it is for a tailor. Thus the public is compelled to receive hashes, instead of fresh dishes; and things that come from a distance, notoriously possessing a charm, it gets the original cookery of London, instead of that of their own country.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Birrell, M.P., Chief-Secretary for Ireland, in {{introducing}} [...] Mr. Clemens said: [...] "We all love Mark Twain, {{and we are}} here to [...] tell him so. One more point--all the world knows it, and that [...] is why it is dangerous to omit it--our guest is a distinguished [...] citizen of the Great Republic beyond the seas. In America his [...] 'Huckleberry Finn' and his 'Tom Sawyer' are what 'Robinson [...] Crusoe' and 'Tom Brown's School Days' have been to us. They [...] are racy of the soil. They are books to which it is impossible [...] to place any period of termination. I will not speak of the [...] classics--reminiscences of much evil in our early lives. We do [...] not meet here to-day as critics with our appreciations and [...] depreciations, our twopenny little prefaces or our forewords. [...] I am not going to say what the world a thousand years hence [...] will think of Mark Twain. Posterity will take care of itself, [...] will read what it wants to read, will forget what it chooses to [...] forget, and will pay no attention whatsoever to our critical [...] mumblings and jumblings. Let us therefore be content to say to [...] our friend and guest that we are here speaking for ourselves [...] and for our children, to say what he has been to us. I [...] remember in Liverpool, in 1867, first buying the copy, which I [...] still preserve, of the celebrated 'Jumping Frog.' It had a few [...] words of preface which reminded me then that our guest in those [...] days was called 'the wild humorist of the Pacific slope,' and a [...] few lines later down, 'the moralist of the Main.' That was [...] some forty years ago. Here he is, still the humorist, still [...] the moralist. His humor enlivens and enlightens his morality, [...] and his morality is all the better for his humor. That is one [...] of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> love him. I am not here to mention any [...] book of his--that is a subject of dispute in my family circle, [...] which is the best and which is the next best--but I must put in [...] a word, lest I should not be true to myself--a terrible thing [...] --for his Joan of Arc, a book of chivalry, of nobility, and of [...] manly sincerity for which I take this opportunity of thanking [...] him. But you can all drink this toast, each one of you with [...] his own intention. You can get into it what meaning you like. [...] Mark Twain is a man whom English and Americans do well to [...] honor. He is the true consolidator of nations. His delightful [...] humor is of the kind which dissipates and destroys national [...] prejudices. His truth and his honor, his love of truth, and [...] his love of honor, overflow all boundaries. He has made the [...] world better by his presence. We rejoice to see him here. [...] Long may he live to reap the plentiful harvest of hearty, [...] honest human affection!" ...|$|E
