5|$|In June 2015, lenders {{warned that}} {{time was running out}} for a deal to be agreed on a new bailout plan. On 17 June, Tsakalotos warned that Greece {{would not be able to}} repay its €1.6bn loan from the IMF at the end of the month unless a new bailout plan was agreed. The {{deadline}} for the renewal of Greece's bailout package was also looming at the end of June. On 26 June, an emergency cabinet meeting led to the calling of a referendum on <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> deal proposed by the creditors. Capital controls and a bank holiday were announced on 28 June, with the Eurozone refusing an extension of <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> plan and Greece defaulting on its loan to the IMF on 30 June.|$|E

5|$|On 13 April, MTV3 {{organised}} another debate, {{which featured}} the same four party chairpersons {{as the debate}} by the Finnish Broadcasting Company two weeks earlier; Katainen, Kiviniemi, Urpilainen and Soini. The party leaders reiterated their stances regarding the EU-sponsored Portuguese bailout; Katainen and Kiviniemi were in favour of it, insisting that <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> is {{necessary in order to}} assure the stability of the European economy and thus in the interest of Finland. Urpilainen and Soini were against <b>the</b> <b>bailout,</b> with Urpilainen demanding more responsibility from banks and investors and Soini repeating his stance that the eurozone cannot possibly function properly with countries like Portugal and Greece as members. Soini also criticised the governing parties for using scare tactics in the form of threatening Finns with rising unemployment if <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> fails to pass. On other issues, Katainen, as he had stated earlier, willing to consider raising the minimum retirement age, while Urpilainen announced that the SDP would not join any coalition that does so. Katainen was the only party leader in favour of Finland's admission to NATO. However, even he said that the admission does not seem possible during the next four years as the majority of Finns are against NATO membership.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 {{amendment}} to <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> eligibility standard {{went into effect}} on August 5, 1984. Between that date and 2013, 196 jurisdictions bailed out of coverage through 38 bailout actions; in each instance, the Attorney General consented to <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> request. Between that date and 2009, all jurisdictions that bailed out were located in Virginia. In 2009, a municipal utility jurisdiction in Texas bailed out after the Supreme Court's opinion in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder (2009), which held that local governments that do not register voters {{have the ability to}} bail out. After this ruling, jurisdictions succeeded in at least 20 bailout actions before the Supreme Court held in Shelby County v. Holder (2013) that the coverage formula was unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November the Troika (the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Central Bank) and the Cypriot Government {{had agreed}} on <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> terms {{with only the}} amount of money {{required}} for <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> remaining to be agreed upon. Bailout terms include strong austerity measures, including cuts in civil service salaries, social benefits, allowances and pensions and increases in VAT, tobacco, alcohol and fuel taxes, taxes on lottery winnings, property, and higher public health care charges. At the insistence of the EU negotiators, at first the proposal also included an unprecedented one-off levy of 6.7% for deposits up to €100.000 and 9.9% for higher deposits on all domestic bank accounts. Following public outcry, the eurozone finance ministers were forced to change the levy, excluding deposits of less than €100,000, and introducing a higher 15.6% levy on deposits of above €100,000 ($129,600)—in line with the EU minimum deposit guarantee. This revised deal was also rejected by the Cypriot parliament on 19 March 2013 with 36 votes against, 19 abstentions and one not present for the vote.|$|E

5|$|By November 1998, UBS's {{losses from}} its {{exposure}} to LTCM were estimated {{at the level}} of approximately CHF 790million. UBS would prove to be the largest single loser in the LTCM collapse, ultimately writing off CHF 950million. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout of US$3.625billion by the hedge fund's major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets. UBS contributed US$300million to <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> effort, which would largely be recovered. In the aftermath of the LTCM collapse, Mathis Cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of UBS, along with three other executives.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May, the True Finns {{announced}} that they would withdraw from the government formation negotiations due to <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> issue. Soini said he would remain true to the True Finns' campaign promises and not compromise the party's core principles. After Soini's announcement, Jyrki Katainen invited the SDP, Green League, SPP and Christian Democrats to negotiate on forming a coalition led by the NCP. On 18 May, Katainen {{announced that}} he would invite the Left Alliance to negotiate as well, beginning on 20 May. The Left Alliance's participation had been demanded by the Social Democrats.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> support {{programme}} feature sufficient financial transfers until March 2016, Cyprus began slowly to regain its {{access to the}} private lending markets already in June 2014. At this point of time, the government sold €0.75bn of bonds with a five-year maturity, {{to the tune of}} a 4.85% yield. A continued selling of bonds with a ten-year maturity, which would equal a regain of complete access to the private lending market (and mark the end of the era with need for bailout support), is expected to happen sometime in 2015. The Cypriot minister of finance recently confirmed, that the government plan to issue two new European Medium Term Note (EMTN) bonds in 2015, likely shortly ahead of the expiry of another €1.1bn bond on 1 July and a second expiry of a €0.9bn bond on 1 November. As announced in advance, the Cypriot government issued €1bn of seven-year bonds with a 4.0% yield by the end of April 2015.|$|E

5|$|Corzine also chaired {{a presidential}} {{commission}} on capital budgeting for Bill Clinton {{and served as}} Chairman of the U.S. Treasury Department's borrowing committee. As the Goldman Sachs senior partner, he helped develop a private sector plan to rescue the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management when the leveraged fund's collapse {{in the fall of}} 1998 threatened contagion across the U.S. financial system. According to U.S. News & World Report, Corzine did not get along with co-CEO Henry Paulson, who came from the other major area of the bank, investment banking. When Corzine participated in structuring <b>the</b> <b>bailout,</b> Paulson seized control of the firm. As co-chairman of the firm, he oversaw its expansion into Asia. When Goldman Sachs went public after Corzine's departure, Corzine made $400million.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July 2012, for {{the first}} time since September 2010, Ireland was able to return to the {{financial}} markets, selling over €5 billion in long-term government debt, with an interest rate of 5.9% for the 5-year bonds and 6.1% for the 8-year bonds at sale. In December 2013, after three years on financial life support, Ireland finally left the EU/IMF bailout programme, although it retained a debt of €22.5 billion to the IMF; in August 2014, early repayment of €15 billion was being considered, which would save the country €375 million in surcharges. Despite the end of <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> the country's unemployment rate remains high and public sector wages are still around 20% lower than at the beginning of the crisis. Government debt reached 123.7% of GDP in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{supplied}} divers {{are usually}} required to carry an emergency gas supply sufficient {{to allow them}} to return to a place of safety if the main gas supply fails. The usual configuration is a back mounted single cylinder supported by the diver's safety harness, with first stage regulator connected by a low-pressure hose to a bailout block, which may be mounted {{on the side of the}} helmet or band-mask or on the harness to supply a lightweight full-face mask. Where the capacity of a single cylinder in insufficient, plain manifolded twins or a rebreather may be used. For closed bell bounce and saturation dives <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> set must be compact enough to allow the diver to pass through the bottom hatch of the bell. This sets a limit on the size of cylinders that can be used.|$|E

30|$|Finally, {{there are}} {{contributions}} that study <b>the</b> effectiveness of <b>bailout</b> programs in ending or, at least, attenuating government debt crises. Li et al.

5|$|While {{the team}} {{experienced}} on-ice success, it {{spent most of}} its first 23 years struggling financially. Quebec City {{was by far the}} smallest market in the league, and the second-smallest to host a team in the four major sports. The changing financial environment in the NHL made things even more difficult. In 1995, team owner Marcel Aubut asked for a bailout from Quebec's provincial government as well as a new publicly funded arena. <b>The</b> <b>bailout</b> fell through, and Aubut subsequently began talks with COMSAT Entertainment Group in Denver, which already owned the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s Denver Nuggets. In May 1995, COMSAT announced an agreement in principle to purchase the team. The deal became official on July 1, 1995, and 12,000 season tickets were sold in the 37 days after the announcement of the move to Denver. Even though the team was losing money, when the team relocated, it still made a profit, it was sold so owner Marcel Aubut could make a profit off of the franchise.|$|E
25|$|Bailout supply {{pressure}} options: If the interstage pressure for <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> regulator {{is lower than}} the main {{supply pressure}}, the main supply will override <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> gas, and continue to flow. This can be a problem if the diver switches to bailout because main supply is contaminated. If on the other hand, bailout pressure is higher than main supply pressure, <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> gas will override the main gas supply if the valve is opened. This will result in <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> gas being used up if the valve leaks. The diver should periodically check that bailout pressure is still sufficient {{for the rest of the}} dive, and abort the dive if it is not. For this reason <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> regulator must be fitted with a submersible pressure gauge to which the diver can refer to check the pressure. This is usually clipped off or tucked into the harness on the left side, where it can be easily reached to read, but is unlikely to snag on anything.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>bailout</b> {{block is}} a small {{manifold}} fitted either to the harness where {{it is in a}} convenient but protected position, commonly on the right side on the waist strap, or on the helmet, also usually {{on the right side of}} the temple, with the valve knob to the side to distinguish it from the free-flow or defogging valve which is commonly to the front. <b>The</b> <b>bailout</b> block has a connection for the main gas supply from the umbilical through a non-return valve. This route can not be closed and supplies the helmet demand valve and free flow valve under normal circumstances. <b>The</b> <b>bailout</b> gas from the back mounted cylinder passes through a conventional scuba first stage at the cylinder valve, to <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> block, where it is normally isolated by <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> valve. When the diver needs to switch over to bailout gas he simply opens <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> valve and the gas is supplied to the helmet or mask. As the valve is normally closed, a leak in the first stage regulator seat will cause the interstage pressure to rise, and unless an overpressure relief valve is fitted to the first stage the hose may burst. Aftermarket overpressure valves are available which can be fitted into a standard low-pressure port of most first stages.|$|E
40|$|The {{idea that}} strong {{connections}} between investment bank executives and politicians {{leads to a}} government <b>bailout</b> when <b>the</b> bank finds itself struggling with insolvency, otherwise known as crony capitalism, has sparked the interest of scholars and popular writers alike (Bartiromo 2010, Cresswell 2008, Prins 2009, Ritholtz 2009, and Rosas 2006). Research on <b>the</b> <b>bailouts</b> of <b>the</b> 2008 financial crisis in particular has indicated that banks who are politically connected {{are more likely to}} receive aid from the Federal Reserve (Blau 2013).

25|$|Mounting options: <b>The</b> <b>bailout</b> {{cylinder}} may {{be mounted}} with the valve {{at the top}} or at the bottom, depending on local codes of practice. A generally used arrangement is to mount the cylinder with the valve up, as this is better protected while kitting up, and the cylinder valve is left fully open while the diver is in the water. This means that the regulator and supply hose to <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> block will be pressurised during the dive, and ready for immediate use by opening <b>the</b> <b>bailout</b> valve on the harness or helmet.|$|E
