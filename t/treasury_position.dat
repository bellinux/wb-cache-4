25|$|As Commodore Commandant of the Coast Guard one of Reynolds first {{concerns}} was {{a renewed}} {{effort by the}} Navy to control the Coast Guard by congressional action and a bill was introduced by Pennsylvania Representative Guy Campbell to accomplish a transfer to the Navy. Many Coast Guard officers felt they had better pay and advancement opportunities if they were transferred to the Navy and they actively supported the legislation by drumming up support for it through shipping trade organizations.

2500|$|Cost. [...] Robert Stack {{provided}} the <b>Treasury</b> <b>position</b> that [...] "Treasury and the IRS have designed our regulations {{in a way}} that minimizes administrative burdens and related costs." [...] Estimates of the additional revenue raised seemed to be heavily outweighed by the cost of implementing the legislation. In March 2012 the Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists (ACFCS) said FATCA was expected to raise revenues of approximately US$800 million per year for the US Treasury with the costs of implementation more difficult to estimate. ACFCS claimed it was extremely likely that the cost of implementing FATCA, [...] borne by the FFIs, would far outweigh the revenues raised by the U.S. Treasury, even excluding the additional costs to the US Internal Revenue Service for the staffing and resources needed to process the data produced. Contrary to established congressional practice, FATCA was not subject to a cost/benefit analysis by the Committee on Ways and Means. Perhaps not considered by Congress, the cost to the global financial institutions to implement FATCA has been reported to range from Forbes's estimate of US$8 billion a year (approximately ten times the amount of estimated revenue raised), to US$200 billion (based on per capita costs for Australia and the UK), to 1-2 trillion USD (chapter of the Chamber of Commerce).|$|E

50|$|The Smith Commission {{said that}} there should be “no detriment” to either {{government}} in this context, something which is technically difficult to achieve. A Scottish government proposal was that future adjustment to the block grant should be based on the “per capita index”, which takes into account the growth in tax receipts across the UK, not just Scotland. This is significant because Scotland’s economy and population are not growing as fast as the UK’s. However, the <b>Treasury</b> <b>position</b> was that this would be unfair {{to the rest of the}} UK.|$|E

Bibb advocated using Treasury surplus revenue from customs and internal revenue collection to supply the sinking fund.

40|$|On March 4 1997, the Treasury Department of the Australian Government {{announced}} sweeping {{measures to}} reform standard setting arrangements in Australia (<b>Treasury</b> Department, <b>Position</b> Statement 1, 1997, p. 9).

In the context of these issues, the present study has three objectives. First, the Treasury Department’s reform agenda is contrasted with earlier reforms attempted by the Australian accounting profession in 1990, in order to highlight different approaches to agenda building. Second, the agenda building models of Cobb et. al. (1972, 1976) are analysed to identify the Treasury Department’s strategic development of and ultimate control over the harmonization issue.
