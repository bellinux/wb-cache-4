Christopher Hitchens in God is Not Great has argued that [...] "Modern vernacular {{describes}} conscience—not too badly—as whatever it is <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> behave well when nobody is looking... Those who believe that the existence of conscience is a proof of a godly design are advancing an argument that simply cannot be disproved because there is no evidence for or against it." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul Watson {{said he was}} not {{offended}} by his portrayal in the episode, and was glad [...] "Whale Whores" [...] brought the issue of dolphin and whale slaughter to a large audience, as well as the role of the Japanese in the deaths. Watson said, [...] "It's a tough situation we are in. We can't hurt the whalers and we have to stay within the boundaries of the law in opposing illegal whaling operations. If <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> pussies, so be it. It's better than being portrayed as killers." [...] Watson said the episode failed to portray that his actions have hurt Japanese profits from whaling, but that the episode demonstrated how successful Whale Wars and the Sea Shepherd has been.|$|E
500|$|The {{fantasy of}} She {{received}} particular acclaim from Victorian readers and critics. The review appearing in The Academy on 15 January {{was impressed by}} the [...] "grown-up" [...] vision of the novel, declaring [...] "the more impossible it gets the better Mr. Haggard does it... his astonishing imagination, and a certain vraisemblance [...] makes the most impossible adventures appear true". This sentiment was echoed in The Queen: The Lady's Newspaper, with the reviewer pronouncing that [...] "this is a tale {{in the hands of a}} writer not so able as Mr. Haggard might easily have become absurd; but he has treated it with so much vividness and picturesque power as to invest it with unflagging interest, and given to the mystery a port of philosophic possibility <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> quite willing to submit to the illusion.|$|E

500|$|Interviewed at {{the time}} of the album's release, Nicky Wire said that the track [...] "Ifwhiteamericatoldthetruthforonedayit'sworldwouldfallapart" [...] was [...] "not a {{completely}} anti-American song", but instead was about [...] "how the most empty culture in the world can dominate in such a total sense". [...] "Of Walking Abortion" [...] is about right-wing totalitarianism, of which Wire commented: [...] "there's a worm in human nature <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> want to be dominated". [...] "Archives of Pain", dealing with the glorification of serial killers and seemingly advocating capital punishment, he said [...] "was the song that me and Richey worried about most [...] the song isn't a right wing statement, it's just against this fascination with people who kill". Later in 1994, Bradfield described the song as [...] "one of the most important things we've done" [...] but said it was also [...] "very right-wing" [...] and [...] "miscalculated".|$|E
500|$|Hobart {{was more}} {{assertive}} as Senate president than his predecessors had been. [...] It was customary {{for the vice}} president not to rule on disputed points, but to submit them to a vote. [...] Hobart, with his experience as a presiding officer in the New Jersey Legislature, took a more assertive role, ruling on disputes, and trying to expedite legislation. [...] Hobart was initially diffident in his role, feeling himself unproven beside longtime national legislators, but soon gained self-confidence, writing in a letter that [...] "I find that I am as good and as capable as any of them. [...] If they know a whole lot of things I don't know, I also know a whole lot of things they don't know. And there is a common humanity running through them all <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> all as one, after all." [...] Hobart was so successful at guiding the administration's legislative agenda through the Senate that he became known as the [...] "assistant President".|$|E
500|$|Despite briefly {{considering}} [...] "Easy Target" [...] to {{be released}} as the album's third single, [...] "Down" [...] was released instead. The video for [...] "Down", which features real-life ex-gang members, made its television premiere in June 2004. The single was a mixed success, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart {{during the week of}} July 31, 2004, but quickly falling off afterward. [...] "Always" [...] was announced as the fourth and final single from Blink-182 in August 2004. [...] "It's gonna change people's lives and might actually change the world forever", DeLonge jokingly predicted. After deciding on the video concept, the clip was recorded and released in November 2004 and continued success all the way into January 2005. A fifth single from the album ("All of This") was discussed; however, plans were dropped following the band's declaration of an 'indefinite hiatus' in February 2005. In response to the idea of [...] "All of This" [...] becoming a possible single, DeLonge joked [...] "We would love it because it's a bad-ass song, and The Cure's Robert Smith sings on it, and <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> cooler than everybody else." ...|$|E

500|$|The film conveys {{what some}} viewers have {{described}} as {{a sense of the}} sublime and numinous. Roger Ebert writes in his essay on 2001 in The Great Movies: [...] In a book on architecture, Gregory Caicco writes that Space Odyssey illustrates how our quest for space is motivated by two contradictory desires, a [...] "desire for the sublime" [...] characterized by a need to encounter something totally other than ourselves—"something numinous"—and the conflicting desire for a beauty <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> feel no longer [...] "lost in space," [...] but at home. Similarly, an article in The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy, titled [...] "Sense of Wonder," [...] describes how 2001 creates a [...] "numinous sense of wonder" [...] by portraying a universe that inspires a sense of awe, which {{at the same time we}} feel we can understand. Christopher Palmer wrote that there exists in the film a coexistence of [...] "the sublime and the banal," [...] as the film implies that to get into space, mankind had to suspend the [...] "sense of wonder" [...] that motivated him to explore space to begin with.|$|E

2500|$|It {{should be}} noted that in this {{evolutionary}} era Catholic teaching on original sin focuses more on its results than on its origins. As Cardinal Ratzinger had intimated in 1981, and as Pope Benedict XIII clarified in 2008: [...] "How did it happen? This remains obscure.... Evil remains mysterious. It is presented as such in great images, as it is in chapter 3 of Genesis, with that scene of the two trees, of the serpent, of sinful man: a great image <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> guess but cannot explain what is itself illogical." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} and summer of 1998, Lipinski toured with Champions on Ice. She then toured with Stars on Ice for four seasons. Lipinski appealed to a younger audience, {{attracting}} new fans to what had traditionally been an adult-oriented show. Her signing to Stars on Ice was reported as a coup for the tour, which at that time was doing well, with some performances routinely selling out months in advance. Choreographer Sandra Bezic commented, [...] "Tara reminds us why we're doing this – the idealism, the genuine love of skating.

The constant stereotyping through every medium <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> feel like being a normal size is not normal, and heaven forbid if you're plus-size.

2500|$|Most of {{his attack}} is {{directed}} against the common conception of rationality, which he believes is badly flawed. First, he argues that reasons don't cause you to do anything, because having sufficient reason wills (but doesn't force) {{you to do that}} thing. So in any decision situation we experience a gap between our reasons and our actions. For example, when we decide to vote, we do not simply determine that we care most about economic policy and that we prefer candidate Jones's economic policy. We also have to make an effort to cast our vote. Similarly, every time a guilty smoker lights a cigarette they are aware of succumbing to their craving, not merely of acting automatically as they do when they exhale. It is this gap <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> think we have freedom of the will. Searle thinks whether we really have free will or not is an open question, but considers its absence highly unappealing because it makes the feeling of freedom of will an epiphenomenon, which is highly unlikely from the evolutionary point of view given its biological cost. He also says: [...] " [...] All rational activity presupposes free will [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|The year 2015 saw Nyong’o make {{a return}} to stage with a {{starring}} role as an unnamed girl in the play Eclipsed, written by Danai Gurira. The play takes place during {{the chaos of the}} Second Liberian Civil War, where the captive wives of a rebel officer band together to form a community, until the balance of their lives are upset by the arrival of a new girl (played by Nyong'o). Eclipsed became The Public Theater's fastest-selling new production in recent history. The play premiered on Broadway at the John Golden Theatre the following year. The production became the first play with an all-black and female creative cast and crew to premiere at Broadway. Nyong'o said that she understudied the play at Yale in 2009 and was terrified to play the character on stage. Her performance met with critical acclaim. The New York Times critic Charles Isherwood called Nyong'o [...] "one of the most radiant young actors to be seen on Broadway in recent seasons, shines with a compassion <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> see beyond the suffering to the indomitable humanity of its characters." [...] Nyong'o's performance in Eclipsed earned her a Theatre World Award for Outstanding Broadway or Off-Broadway Debut Performance, an Obie Award for a Distinguished Performance by an Ensemble, and a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. In addition, she was nominated for Outstanding Actress in a Play at the Outer Critics Circle Award and a Distinguished Performance Award at the Drama League Award. Nyong'o revealed in her Lenny Letter that she turned down Hollywood films in order to bring Eclipsed to life on Broadway.|$|E
