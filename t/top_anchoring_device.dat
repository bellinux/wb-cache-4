40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} three-dimensional (3 D) -constitutive models for concrete formulated {{in the framework of}} plasticity theory to structural analyses of <b>anchor</b> <b>devices.</b> For this purpose, two commonly employed concrete material models are considered. The first model, the extended Leon model, is based on one yield surface for the description of compressive and tensile failure of concrete. The second material model is a multisurface plasticity model consisting of three Rankine yield surfaces and a Drucker-Prager yield surface. The predictive capability of the models is demonstrated by means of <b>anchor</b> <b>devices,</b> commonly employed in structural engineering for the connection of steel and concrete members. Such devices induce strongly nonuniform triaxial stress states in the surrounding concrete, ranging from tensile, overcompressive, to confined compressive stress states. In the vicinity of the anchor head, even nearly hydrostatic stress states may occur. The numerical simulations {{on the basis of the}} employed 3 D material models for concrete give insight into the load-carrying behavior of the investigated <b>anchor</b> <b>devices.</b> Two headed studs characterized by different shapes of the anchor head and an undercut anchor are considered. Comparison of the peak loads and failure modes of the respective <b>anchor</b> <b>device</b> predicted by the numerical models with experimental data highlight the strength and weakness of the employed material models. It is shown that some load cases may lead to rather large differences in peak load depending on the choice of material model. These differences are based on the individual properties of the constitutive models for concrete and, hence, detailed knowledge of the model under consideration is essential for giving accurate estimates of the peak load of the <b>anchor</b> <b>device</b> and the failure mode of concrete...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the feasibility, reproducibility {{and efficacy of}} a new tissue <b>anchoring</b> <b>device</b> in a porcine survival model. METHODS: Gastrotomies were performed using a needle-knife and balloon dilator in 10 female Yorkshire pigs weighing 30 - 35 kg. Gastric closure was attempted using a new tissue <b>anchoring</b> <b>device.</b> The tightness of the closure was confirmed by means of air insufflation {{and the ability to}} maintain gastric distension with stability in peritoneal pressure measured with a Veress needle. All animals were monitored daily for signs of peritonitis and sepsis over 14 d. During necropsy, the peritoneal cavity and the gastric access site were examined. RESULTS: Transgastric access, closure and 14 d survival was achieved in all pigs. The mean closure time was 18. 1 ± 19. 2 min and a mean of 2. 1 ± 1 devices were used. Supplementary clips were necessary in 2 cases. The closure time was progressively reduced (24. 8 ± 13. 9 min in the first 5 pigs vs 11. 4 ± 5. 9 min in the last 5, P = NS). At necropsy, the gastric access site was correctly closed in all cases with all brace-bars present. One device was misplaced in the mesocolon. Minimal adhesions were observed in 3 pigs and signs of mild peritonitis and adhesions in one. CONCLUSIONS: The use of this new tissue <b>anchoring</b> <b>device</b> in porcine stomachs is feasible, reproducible and effective and requires a short learning curve...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) materials for external strengthening of existing masonry elements is strictly conditioned by debonding phenomena. To avoid or delay the debonding and, hence, attain higher failure loads or larger ductility at failure, end <b>anchoring</b> <b>devices</b> {{may be a}} very suitable solution. Several types of end <b>anchoring</b> <b>devices</b> have been proposed, especially for concrete elements, but for none of them design indications for predicting the increase in failure load have been suggested so far. This paper is firstly aimed to {{provide an overview of}} the most diffuse and efficient anchoring techniques and quantify their efficiency in terms of failure load increase. Then, it presents the results of a wide experimental program carried out by the author and concerning bond tests on masonry elements externally bonded with Carbon FRP sheets and provided of different types of end <b>anchoring</b> <b>devices.</b> The bond tests have been realized according to a single pull-push set-up. Single stones made of yellow tuff and prisms made of clay bricks were used as support for the bond tests.

The SPATZ-ABS is a new adjustable saline filled balloon. PRESENTATION OF CASEThree patients have presented to our hospital as emergencies due to complications arising from this balloon. Two of these patients required emergency laparotomy and resection of small bowel due to pressure necrosis effects of the <b>anchoring</b> <b>device.</b> One patient had migration of the device into the duodenum that was removed endoscopically. Of the 2 patients who underwent a laparotomy, one patient {{did not have any}} symptoms or signs that correlated with the intra-operative findings. DISCUSSIONThe <b>anchoring</b> <b>device</b> meant to prevent the intra-gastric balloon from migrating distally has migrated in three patients. To our knowledge, there has been no reported incident of migration of this device. These serious complications pose a risk to patients having these balloons fitted.

40|$|Due {{to changes}} in the Swedish design code in 1994, timber {{construction}} is no longer limited to two-storey buildings. This change has created an attractive market for multi-storey timber structures. A Scandinavian glulam manufacturer, Moelven Töreboda, started in 2007 to develop a new beam and post building system in timber for multi-storey buildings with the Swedish commercial name, “trä 8 ”. For “trä 8 ”, the stabilising system is based on prefabricated wall panels placed at a few locations in the building. The stabilising elements consist of double sheathing of LVL Kerto-Q boards glued and screwed to a glulam frame. The panels are typically of 2. 4 m width and continuous up to four storey height. The elements are fixed to the foundation by using special <b>anchoring</b> <b>devices,</b> which include threaded rods glued-in lengthwise in the timber member. In this paper, an introductory experimental study of the efficiency of this prefabricated wall panel used as a stabilising element is reported. Experimental results from full-scale testing of the racking performance of the stabilising element including the <b>anchoring</b> <b>device</b> are presented. The study, which focuses on the stiffness and the serviceability state, demonstrates that the presented wall panel elements, as part of a beam and post system for multi-storey buildings, have the potential to provide the necessary horizontal stability for the building.

40|$|Purpose: Magnetic <b>anchoring</b> <b>devices</b> {{may reduce}} the number of port sites needed in laparoscopic surgery. In this study, we prospectively {{assessed}} the feasibility of using a magnetic anchoring and guidance system (MAGS) in laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery performed by novices. Materials and Methods: A total of 10 LESS simple nephrectomies were performed with or without MAGS in a nonsurvival porcine model by 6 operators with no previous LESS surgery experience. After installation of the homemade single port, an intra-abdominal magnet was fixed to the renal parenchyma with suturing and stabilized by an external magnet placed on the flank so that the position of the kidney could be easily changed by moving the external handheld magnet. The length of the procedure and any intraoperative complications were evaluated. Results: Operative time (mean±standard deviation) was shorter in the group using the magnetic <b>anchoring</b> <b>device</b> (M-LESS-N) than in the group with conventional LESS nephrectomy (C-LESS-N) (63 ± 20. 8 minutes vs. 82 ± 40. 7 minutes, respectively). Although all nephrectomies were completed uneventfully in the M-LESS-N group, renal vein injury occurred during dissection of the renal hilum in two cases of C-LESS-N and was resolved by simultaneous transection of the renal artery and vein with an Endo-GIA stapler. Conclusions: LESS-N using MAGS is a feasible technique for surgeons with no LESS surgery experience. Taking into account the 2 cases of renal vein injury in the C-LESS-N group, the application of MAGS may be beneficial for overcoming the learning curve of LESS surgery...|$|R
