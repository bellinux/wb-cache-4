5|$|The second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, takes Scrooge to a joy-filled {{market of}} people buying {{the makings of}} Christmas dinner and {{celebrations}} of Christmas in a miner's cottage and in a lighthouse. Scrooge and the ghost also visit Fred's Christmas party. A major part of this stave is taken up with Bob Cratchit's family feast and introduces his youngest son, Tiny Tim, a happy boy who is seriously ill. The spirit informs Scrooge <b>that</b> <b>Tiny</b> Tim will die soon unless {{the course of events}} changes. Before disappearing, the spirit shows Scrooge two hideous, emaciated children named Ignorance and Want. He tells Scrooge to beware the former above all and mocks Scrooge's concern for their welfare.|$|E
5|$|While {{the border}} on land was firmly {{set in the}} early 20th century, the two states were still in {{disagreement}} {{on the path of}} the border to the east, in Lake Erie. In 1973, the two states finally obtained a hearing before the United States Supreme Court on their competing claims to the Lake Erie waters. In Michigan v. Ohio, the court upheld a special master's report and ruled that the boundary between the two states in Lake Erie was angled to the northeast, as described in Ohio's state constitution, and not a straight east–west line. One consequence of the court decision was <b>that</b> <b>tiny</b> Turtle Island just outside Maumee Bay and originally treated as being wholly in Michigan, was split between the two states.|$|E

25|$|The quantum {{fluctuations}} at <b>that</b> <b>tiny</b> point, in Hawking's original calculation, contain all {{the outgoing}} radiation. The modes that eventually contain the outgoing radiation at long times are redshifted {{by such a}} huge amount by their long sojourn next to the event horizon, that they start off as modes with a wavelength much shorter than the Planck length. Since {{the laws of physics}} at such short distances are unknown, some find Hawking's original calculation unconvincing.|$|E
25|$|Orthodox {{and some}} Conservative {{authorities}} rule that turning electric devices {{on or off}} is prohibited as a melakhah; however, authorities are not in agreement about exactly which one(s). One view is <b>that</b> <b>tiny</b> sparks are created in a switch when the circuit is closed, and this would constitute lighting a fire (category 37). If the appliance is purposed for light or heat (such as an incandescent bulb or electric oven), then the lighting or heating elements may {{be considered as a}} type of fire that falls under both lighting a fire (category 37) and cooking (i.e., baking, category 11). Turning lights off would be extinguishing a fire (category 36).|$|E
25|$|The Casimir effect {{shows that}} {{quantum field theory}} allows the energy density in certain regions of space to be {{negative}} relative to the ordinary vacuum energy, {{and it has been}} shown theoretically that quantum field theory allows states where energy can be arbitrarily negative at a given point. Many physicists, such as Stephen Hawking, Kip Thorne and others, therefore argue that such effects might make it possible to stabilize a traversable wormhole. Physicists have not found any natural process that would be predicted to form a wormhole naturally in the context of general relativity, although the quantum foam hypothesis is sometimes used to suggest <b>that</b> <b>tiny</b> wormholes might appear and disappear spontaneously at the Planck scale, and stable versions of such wormholes have been suggested as dark matter candidates. It has also been proposed that, if a tiny wormhole held open by a negative mass cosmic string had appeared {{around the time of the}} Big Bang, it could have been inflated to macroscopic size by cosmic inflation.|$|E

500|$|Pollution {{produced}} by humans may be seriously weakening the Earth's water cycle [...] reducing rainfall and threatening fresh water supplies. A 2001 study {{by researchers at}} the Scripps Institution of Oceanography suggests <b>that</b> <b>tiny</b> particles of soot and other pollutants {{have a significant effect on}} the hydrological cycle. According to Veerabhadran Ramanathan, [...] "the energy for the hydrological cycle comes from sunlight. As sunlight heats the ocean, water escapes into the atmosphere and falls out as rain. So as aerosols cut down sunlight by large amounts, they may be spinning down the hydrological cycle of the planet." ...|$|E
500|$|Until {{the early}} 19th century, the {{prevailing}} view in Western societies was that differences between individuals {{of a species}} were uninteresting departures from their Platonic ideals (or [...] ) of created kinds. However, the theory of uniformitarianism in geology promoted the idea that simple, weak forces could act continuously {{over long periods of}} time to produce radical changes in the Earth's landscape. The success of this theory raised awareness of the vast scale of geological time and made plausible the idea <b>that</b> <b>tiny,</b> virtually imperceptible changes in successive generations could produce consequences on the scale of differences between species.|$|E

[...] It was a simple accident. [...] Kongo was in one part of the double cage, Lulu in another, and between them was a partition of narrow bars. [...] Lulu had Patty Cake in her arms and when Patty reached in between the narrow bars to touch her father, Lulu suddenly pulled her away. [...] But Patty's arm got caught in the narrow bars and broke. [...] It was a freak accident. [...] No one ever realized that those bars were narrow enough to catch <b>that</b> <b>tiny</b> arm.|$|E
500|$|The next day, Mulder visits Barry in the hospital. Agent Kazdin appears, {{revealing}} that metal implants {{were found in}} Barry's body and <b>that</b> <b>tiny</b> holes were found in his teeth, {{in the same manner}} he had described. Mulder gives one of the implants to Scully, who has it reviewed by a ballistics expert; they find a microscopic barcode imprinted on it. Later, at a supermarket, Scully swipes the implant across a checkout scanner, causing the machine to malfunction while displaying a strange serial number. At her house, Scully leaves a message on Mulder's voicemail, suggesting that Barry had been [...] "catalogued" [...] by the implant. But just then, Barry—having just escaped from the hospital—breaks in through Scully's window and kidnaps her.|$|E
500|$|A paved trail {{less than}} 1/4mile (400m) long at North Crater Flow (...) crosses the North Crater Lava Flow, which formed about 2200years ago, {{making it one}} of the {{youngest}} lava flows on the Craters of the Moon Lava Field. This lava is named for the purplish-blue tint <b>that</b> <b>tiny</b> pieces of obsidian (volcanic glass) on its surface exhibit. Good examples of pahoehoe (ropey), aa (jagged), and some block lava are readily visible along with large rafted crater wall fragments. The rafted crater wall fragments seen on the flow were once part of this cinder cone but were torn away when the volcano's lava-filled crater was breached. A 1.8-mile-long trail (2.9km) includes the 1/2mile (800m) overlook trail but continues on through the crater and to the Big Craters/Spatter Cones parking lot.|$|E

500|$|Before {{becoming}} {{a model to}} support her acting career, Guillory waited tables at a club. In an interview in 2000, she said about the experience [...] "Supporting my acting habit with waitressing {{was probably the most}} useful thing I've done." [...] During her time as a model, she studied acting at the New World School of the Arts and the Paris Conservatoire, also taking small television and film roles in The Future Lasts a Long Time (1996), The Rules of Engagement (1999), Star! Star! (1999), Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang) (2000), The 3 Kings (2000), and Two Days, Nine Lives (2000). During this time, Guillory decided to go on with her acting career because [...] "I was so scared of going to university and being with people my own age again, having been with <b>that</b> <b>tiny</b> little sect of girls in Norfolk whose daddies were farmers and politicians, who didn't trust me and didn't know where I was coming from".|$|E
500|$|Pluto's orbit lay {{within this}} band and thus its {{planetary}} status {{was thrown into}} question. [...] Many scientists concluded <b>that</b> <b>tiny</b> Pluto should be reclassified as a minor planet, just as Ceres had been a century earlier. Mike Brown of the California Institute of Technology suggested that a [...] "planet" [...] should be redefined as [...] "any body in the Solar System that is more massive than the total mass {{of all of the}} other bodies in a similar orbit." [...] Those objects under that mass limit would become minor planets. In 1999, Brian G. Marsden of Harvard University's Minor Planet Center suggested that Pluto be given the minor planet number 10000 while still retaining its official position as a planet. The prospect of Pluto's [...] "demotion" [...] created a public outcry, and in response the International Astronomical Union clarified that it was not at that time proposing to remove Pluto from the planet list.|$|E

2500|$|In December 27, 1988, Tiny Toons {{was changed}} from a film to a {{television}} series, with Jean MacCurdy overseeing production of the first 65 episodes. MacCurdy said <b>that</b> <b>Tiny</b> Toons was changed to a television series to [...] "reach a broader audience". For the series, MacCurdy hired Tom Ruegger, who previously wrote cartoons for Filmation and Hanna-Barbera, to be a producer.
