Due to the higher accuracy it is possible <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>thinner</b> and hence lighter castings, because extra metal need not be present to allow for variations in the molds.

50|$|The advancements made to {{the thin}} film lithium ion battery have allowed for many {{potential}} applications. The majority of these applications are aimed at improving the currently available consumer and medical products. Thin film lithium ion batteries can be used <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>thinner</b> portable electronics, because {{the thickness of the}} battery required to operate the device can be reduced greatly. These batteries have the ability to {{be an integral part of}} implantable medical devices, such as defibrillators and neural stimulators, “smart” cards, radio frequency identification, or RFID, tags and wireless sensors. They can also serve as a way to store energy collected from solar cells or other harvesting devices. Each of these applications is possible because of the flexibility in the size and shape of the batteries. The size of these devices does not have to revolve around the size of the space needed for the battery anymore. The thin film batteries can be attached to the inside of the casing or in some other convenient way. There are many opportunities in which to use this type of batteries.|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} is described to detect bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporated by cells in S-phase, with a monoclonal antibody, using removable plastic embedding and immunogold-silver staining (IGSS). The incubation times were reduced and the immunological reactions enhanced by microwave irradiation. The embedding in methyl methacrylate enabled us <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>thinner</b> sections and it improved {{the quality of}} the preparations. The methyl methacrylate did not hinder the reaction of BrdU with the antibody because it could be removed prior to the IGSS procedure. The IGSS procedure appeared to be very sensitive, requiring lower concentrations of the antibodies than other methods. The use of microwave irradiation shortened the time needed to stain a section from 7 to less than 4 h. Furthermore, using microwave irradiation, the concentration of the antibodies needed could be reduced even further compared with the normal IGSS procedure. In sections of the mouse testis and small intestine only nuclei of cells known to be able to proliferate appeared BrdU positive. The non-specific background staining was found to be negligible. In testes of mice that received both 3 H-thymidine and BrdU more than 95 % of the radioactively labelled cells also showed BrdU label and vice versa. This indicates that both methods are equally sensitive for detecting cells in S-phas...|$|E
30|$|Spin-dip process usually {{leads to}} the {{formation}} of thicker perovskite films. Although the thicker layer of perovskite may lead to improved light absorption, the film thickness cannot exceed the charge diffusion length. Therefore, alternatively, spin-spin coating may be adopted, instead of spin-dip coating, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>thinner</b> layers. In this method, the dipping process is simply replaced by a second spinning process to deposit a thin layer of MAI solution atop the PbCl 2 layer. Dynamic interaction and mixing between solid PbCl 2 and wet MAI layers, due to spinning, results in the formation of perovskite. Run 10 of Table  1 shows the conditions of the spin-spin sample, determined based on the literature data and our preliminary optimization process. In order to enable high solvent evaporation, the substrate was heated before precursor deposition. Therefore, a stable perovskite layer formed, but the film had a large roughness of 0.67  μm, higher than those observed in spin-dip samples (Table  1). It is also found that, in general, at similar process and fabrication conditions, the surface topography of the film made by spin-spin coating is similar to the topography of the film made by spin-dip coating (figure not shown). It was also observed that in spin-spin coating, when the MAI solution was spun atop the spun-on PbCl 2 thin film, the color changed to dark brown even before annealing, indicating that the perovskite layer had formed. Therefore, perovskite conversion in spin-spin coating is achieved easier than that in spin-dip coating, due to the positive effect of the centrifugal forces that improve mixing of the precursors and therefore lead to better chemical conversion. On the other hand, the presence of the centrifugal forces applied on the wet perovskite film may promote dewetting; nevertheless, by controlling the spin velocity, the dewetted areas and defects may be decreased.|$|E
40|$|Problem debljine nemetalnih estetskih krunica u literaturi se često rješava preporukom da stijenka krunice mora imati debljinu od najmanje 1 milimetar. Jedan od razloga za takvu uputu je zaštita krunice od promjene boje zbog utjecaja cementa ili podloge. Međutim, u praksi se pokazuje, osobito pri izradi akrilatnih krunica, da vrlo kontrastne podloge mogu prosijavati i kroz 1 milimetar debelu stijenku, a s druge strane, uvijek nije miti moguće niti potrebno ostvariti ovu debljinu. Autori su pristupačnim metodama ispitivali utjecaj podloge u odnosu na sloj akrilata i došli do zaključka da ni propisana debljina stvarno nije dovoljna zaštita od vrlo kontrastnih podloga te da je mnogo važnije i jednostavnije pravilnim izborom boje cementa isključiti utjecaj podloge, što zadovoljava i tamo gdje je iz mehaničko-statičkih razloga dopuštena i izrada tanje krunice. The {{problem of}} the {{thickness}} of non-metal aesthetic dental crowns has often been solved in the literature by the recommendation that {{the wall of the}} crown must be at least 1 mm thick. One of the reasons for such a recommendation is to protect the crown from changes in colour due to the effect of cement or the foundation. However, practice has shown, especially when making acrylic crowns, that highly contrasting bases may show through a wall of even 1 millimeter thickness {{and on the other hand}} it is not always possible nor necessary to achieve this thickness. The authors investigated the effect of the base in relationship to the layer of acrylic and reached the conclusion that not even the recommended thickness offers in fact sufficient protection from the greatly contrasting base and that it is much more important and simpler too to eliminate the effect of the base by the correct choice of the cement colour. This has proved satisfactory even in cases where for mechanical and statical reasons it was permissible <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>thinner</b> crowns. Die Dicke der nichtmetallischen aesthetischen Krone wird in der Literatur mit der mindest Wanddicke von 1 mm angegeben. Dieser Vorschlag wird wegen der Verfärbung durch den Einfluss des Zements oder anderer Unterlagen, begründet. Die Praxis jedoch ergibt, insbesondere für Akrylatkronen, dass selbst sehr kontrastreiche Unterlagen durch eine 1 mm dicke Wand durchschimmern können, andererseits ist es nicht immer möglich, noch nötig, diese Dicke herzustellen. Die Autoren haben den Einfluss der Unterlage auf die Akrylatschichte untersucht und kamen zum Ergebnis, dass die vorgeschriebene Wandstarke von 1 mm keinen genügenden Schutz vor kontrastreichen Unterlagen gewährleistet. Viel wichtiger und einfacher ist es durch eine richtige Auswahl der Zementfarbe den Einfluss der Unterlage auszuschalten, was auch dort zufriedenstellende Ergebnisse zeitigt, wo aus mechanisch-statischen Gründen eine dünnere Kronenwand ausgeführt wird...|$|E

Sections of approximately 60 – 90  nm thickness must be prepared to achieve our goal. This requirement is fulfilled by embedding into plastic polymers (embedding resins) which are highly hydrophobic. Therefore, the samples must be dehydrated before getting into the embedding resin. Dehydration is carried out as a stepwise process where a series of ethanol solutions with increasing concentration up to absolute alcohol is changed sequentially over the samples. Finally, propylene-oxide is applied to chemically remove even traces of water. This is followed by the infiltration with the resin.
