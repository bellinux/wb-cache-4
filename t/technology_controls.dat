Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current <b>technology</b> <b>controls</b> our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E

5000|$|In {{business}} and accounting, information <b>technology</b> <b>controls</b> (or IT controls) are specific activities performed by persons or systems {{designed to ensure}} that business objectives are met. They are a subset of an enterprise's internal control. IT control objectives relate to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and the overall management of the IT function of the business enterprise. IT controls are often described in two categories: IT general controls (ITGC) and IT application controls. ITGC include controls over the Information Technology (IT) environment, computer operations, access to programs and data, program development and program changes. IT application controls refer to transaction processing controls, sometimes called [...] "input-processing-output" [...] controls. Information <b>technology</b> <b>controls</b> have been given increased prominence in corporations listed in the United States by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The COBIT Framework (Control Objectives for Information Technology) is a widely used framework promulgated by the IT Governance Institute, which defines a variety of ITGC and application control objectives and recommended evaluation approaches. IT departments in organizations are often led by a Chief Information Officer (CIO), {{who is responsible for}} ensuring effective information <b>technology</b> <b>controls</b> are utilized.|$|E

He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work. Engelbart's philosophy and research agenda is most clearly and directly expressed in the 1962 research report: Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework The concept of network augmented intelligence is attributed to Engelbart based on this pioneering work.|$|E

30|$|By {{means of}} {{technology}}, as already seen, the problem becomes even worse. Indeed, technology implies an extension and complication of that social signalling through which society can gain {{information in a}} self-referential way. A further ‘adverse effect’ is that, because of operational closure, technology can only be technologically controlled. The paradoxical outcome is that, while the technical control of a danger is a risk, the spreading {{of the risk of}} dangers <b>controlling</b> <b>technologies</b> (and of <b>technologies</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>technologies)</b> in turn becomes an incontrollable danger. Since technologies gives experts the impression of keeping everything under control and being able to face unexpected events, they let them ill-equipped when an unpredictable event occurs; for instance, when <b>technology</b> or <b>technology</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>technology</b> suddenly doesn’t function.|$|R

50|$|This {{bandwidth}} is {{also known}} as the terahertz gap because it is noticeably underutilized. This is because terahertz waves are electromagnetic waves with frequencies higher than microwaves but lower than infrared radiation and visible light. These characteristics mean {{that it is difficult to}} influence terahertz radiation with conventional electronic components and devices. Electronics <b>technology</b> <b>controls</b> the flow of electrons, and is well developed for microwaves and radio frequencies. Likewise, the terahertz gap also borders optical or photonic wavelengths; the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet ranges (or spectrums), where well developed lens technologies also exist. However, the terahertz wavelength, or frequency range, appears to be useful for security screening, medical imaging, wireless communications systems, non-destructive evaluation, and chemical identification, as well as submillimeter astronomy. Finally, as a non-ionizing radiation it does not have the risks inherent in X-ray screening.|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} auditors {{and external}} auditors {{of the organization}} also measure the effectiveness of internal control through their efforts. They assess whether the controls are properly designed, implemented and working effectively, and make recommendations {{on how to improve}} internal control. They may also review Information <b>technology</b> <b>controls,</b> which relate to the IT systems of the organization. There are laws and regulations on internal control related to financial reporting in a number of jurisdictions. In the U.S. these regulations are specifically established by Sections 404 and 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Guidance on auditing these controls is specified in PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5 and SEC guidance, further discussed in SOX 404 top-down risk assessment. To provide reasonable assurance that internal controls involved in the financial reporting process are effective, they are tested by the external auditor (the organizations public accountants), who are required to opine on the internal controls of the company and the reliability of its financial reporting.|$|E

[...] The second misunderstanding is technology is not a part of consciousness. The truth is that technology is a part of consciousness as [...] "the conceptualization of technology has gone through drastic changes." [...] The third misunderstanding is that <b>technology</b> <b>controls</b> society and consciousness, when really technology does not control society and consciousness; meaning [...] "that technology is rooted in consciousness {{as an integral part of}} mental life for everyone. This understanding will most likely alter how both patients and psychologists deal with the trials and tribunes of living with technology." [...] The last misunderstanding is society controls technology and consciousness which is not true, society does not control technology and consciousness. [...] "…(other) accounts fail to acknowledge the complex relational nature of technology as an operation within mind and society. This realization shifts the focus on technology to its origins within the human mind as explained through the theory of technological consciousness." ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. This topic has been widely addressed by the researches in the United States of America (US) after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act due to the increase of responsibilities on these controls. Italy has followed the US regulation with the law number 262 of 2005 and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting have become of {{the interest of the}} regulators and of the companies that have to implement their evaluation. The thesis aims to analyze the effectiveness of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. The effectiveness can be analyzed looking at the output of the Internal Controls over Financial Reporting evaluation or looking at the procedures used in this evaluation. The outputs of the evaluation are the Internal Control Deficiencies found and disclosed to the market by the responsible for Internal Controls over Financial Reporting, that usually is the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Literature based on Sarbanes-Oxley Act usually uses this approach because in US is possible to have public data on Internal Control Deficiencies disclosed to the market. In Italy this kind of disclosure is limited, thus one part of the thesis analyzes the Internal Control Deficiencies found by the companies but not disclosed to the market because under the materiality level. The thesis looks at the Internal Auditor Detection Process to understand where are the problems that bring to more severe and persistent Internal Control Deficiencies and look for the type of Internal Control Deficiencies more severe and persistent. The idea under this research is to find the more problematic issues where the companies have to focus to increase the effectiveness of their Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Because of this difficulty in data availability for Internal Control Deficiencies, the effectiveness have been analyzed looking at the procedures used to evaluate the Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. The procedures have been analyzed looking at the quality of each phase of the audit cycle. The Internal Controls over Financial Reporting have been divided in its components of Entity Level Controls, Account-specific Controls and Information <b>Technology</b> <b>Controls.</b> Information <b>Technology</b> <b>Controls</b> Quality has been then related to audit risk and audit fees to see the relation between internal controls and external controls performed by external auditors. The idea under this research is that if the internal controls are effective and assure a higher reliability of financial reporting, the external auditors can reduce their work. Finally Information <b>Technology</b> <b>Controls</b> have been deeply investigates in their relevant component of outsourced controls. Based on specific frameworks, one part of the thesis address the Audit Quality of Outsourced Information <b>Technology</b> <b>Controls,</b> that is of significant interest nowadays. The idea under this research is that the evaluation of these controls without going directly in the outsourcers’ location is not enough to assure the effectiveness and the reliability of financial reporting that use the information technology controlled. Even if the standards let to use indirect evaluation or service auditors’ attestations, the thesis proposes to use the direct evaluation for a better effectiveness. Thus, the thesis is structured in three studies: 1. 	Audit Quality of Outsourced Information <b>Technology</b> <b>Controls.</b> 2.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{synthesize}} current practices and procedures on the prevention of backing fatalities in highway work zones. First, general work zone safety hazards are reviewed, particularly blind areas are identified. Second, engineering controls currently in use are examined and explained to help understand what steps can be taken to prevent future backing fatalities. Third, administrative controls (including signalers, drivers, and workers-on-foot training) are also discussed. Fourth, existing <b>technology</b> <b>controls</b> are reviewed for use in aiding equipment operators in identifying when pedestrian personnel are in dangerous areas around their equipment (i. e., back-up camera, radar). Fifth, recommendations are made based on the comprehensive review of the backover fatality prevention techniques in construction work zones and the conducted testing results of several commercially available systems. Recommendations on engineering and <b>technology</b> <b>controls</b> are discussed, with detailed information such as improving internal traffic control plans, and integrating technology with traffic control plans. Information and drawings are provided to illustrate how to design work zones, and the internal traffic flow diagrams are created using the integrated technology available, and site specific characteristics. The drawings represent examples of using different types of technology, in different scenarios using the proper legend, as well as using the proper general and technology notes to help explain the traffic control plan, ensuring that full comprehension is made. Recommendations on administrative controls are also given such as how to conduct safety meetings, electing safety officers, how to set regulations and guidelines for workers, and how to handle training. Training should be used as a backover fatality prevention method for pedestrian workers, flaggers, spotters, and equipment operators.
