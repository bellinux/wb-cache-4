5|$|Leopold's abdication {{message of}} 1 August 1950 was premised on a {{reconciliation}} {{in the person}} of his eldest son over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Baudouin was seen by most parties as an acceptable alternative candidate. According to a law approved on 11 August, executive powers were transferred to Baudouin in advance of the official abdication. Leopold formally abdicated on 16 July 1951. His son succeeded him the following day.|$|E

5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are among}} the least studied of all lemurs, and {{little is known about}} them. Only the pale fork-marked lemur (P.pallescens) has been studied {{relatively}} well, primarily by Pierre Charles-Dominique, Jean-Jacques Petter, and Georges Pariente during two expeditions in the 1970s and a more extensive 1998 study in Kirindy Forest. Like the other cheirogaleids, these lemurs are nocturnal, sleeping in tree hollows (typically in large baobab trees) or abandoned nests built by giant mouse lemurs (Mirza coquereli) during the day. Some of the abandoned nests they sleep in are leaf-lined, and fresh leaves are often added when young are born. As many as 30sleeping sites may be used over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> each for a variable length of time.|$|E
5|$|Gerty Theresa Radnitz {{was born}} into a Jewish family in Prague in 1896. Her father, Otto Radnitz, was a chemist who became manager of sugar {{refineries}} after inventing a successful method for refining sugar. Her mother, Martha, a friend of Franz Kafka, was a culturally sophisticated woman. Gerty was tutored at home before enrolling in a Lyceum for girls, and at the age of 16 she decided {{she wanted to be a}} medical doctor. Pursuing the study of science, Gerty learned that she lacked the prerequisites in Latin, physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> she managed to study the equivalent of eight years of Latin, five years of science, and five years of math.|$|E
5|$|Late Registration is {{the second}} studio album by American hip hop {{producer}} and rapper Kanye West. It was recorded over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> in sessions held across studios in New York City and Hollywood, with West collaborating with American record producer and composer Jon Brion. The album features guest contributions from Adam Levine, Lupe Fiasco, Jamie Foxx, Common, Jay-Z, Brandy, and Nas, among others. Its production was notably more lush and elaborate than West's 2004 debut album The College Dropout, as he utilized intricate sampling methods and string orchestration with Brion. West's lyrics explore both personal and political themes, including poverty, drug trafficking, racism, healthcare, and the blood diamond trade.|$|E

The programs are administered and managed by part-time adult volunteers. All participants, including youth and adult staff, pay fees to participate. Fees for participants attending the week-long summer camp are US$275–$325 in 2012. Candidate attendees to White Stag Sierra pay up to $320, while the Association in Monterey charges $335. , adult and youth staff volunteers paid about US$400 in fees over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> of staff development.|$|E
5|$|The islands {{all fall}} within the Shetland Islands Council local authority. They have been {{continuously}} inhabited since Neolithic times and experienced Norse rule for several centuries, the first written records being the Norse sagas. The excavations at Jarlshof near {{the southern end of}} the Mainland have provided archaeological evidence of life in Shetland since Bronze Age times and the annual Up Helly Aa fire festivals are a living reminder of Shetland's Viking past. The archipelago is exposed to wind and tide and there are numerous lighthouses as an aid to navigation. A small wind farm on Shetland recently achieved a world record of 58% capacity over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> The indigenous Shetland ponies are reputed for their strength and hardiness.|$|E

5|$|Female {{cats are}} {{seasonally}} polyestrous, {{which means they}} may have many periods of heat over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days. Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing penile spines, which are about 1mm long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake {{the walls of the}} female's vagina, which acts to induce ovulation. This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm {{in the context of a}} second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, Earth's {{perihelion}} occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates {{change over}} time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun {{at about the same}} time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E

On April 13, 2010 the band released the first EP Simple Science on Flyover Records. Despite their reformation, obligations to other projects limited {{the amount of time}} the band could spend together. On their 2010 tour, fun. bassist Nate Harold filled in for Rob Pope, who was already committed to touring with Spoon. In 2011 while James Dewees was on a world tour with My Chemical Romance, New Amsterdams regular Dustin Kinsey filled in on keyboards.|$|E

Braathens SAFE was the launch customer of the F-28, {{and the first}} plane landed in Oslo on 3 March. Five F-28s were delivered in <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> in addition to one aircraft that was leased periodically until 1971. There were several technical problems due to having the earliest models of the F-28, causing some operational difficulties. Two DC-6s were sold, and all but three of the F-27s were sold to Fokker between October 1968 and May 1969. Along with the aircraft came a new simulator, and the simulator division was moved from Sola to Fornebu. On 27 February 1970, the company took into use an IT-system, based at Sola.|$|E
5|$|The male yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} has a black bill, a dull yellow patch {{behind each}} eye, and pinkish or reddish eye-rings. The female has grey eye-rings, a horn-coloured bill, and brighter and more clearly defined yellow cheek-patches. Immature birds have duller plumage overall, a horn-coloured bill, and grey eye-rings; The upper beak of the immature male darkens to black by {{two years of}} age, commencing {{at the base of}} the bill and spreading over ten weeks. The lower beak blackens later by four years of age. The elongated bill has a pointed maxilla (upper beak), suited to digging out grubs from tree branches and trunks. Records of the timing of the eye ring changing from grey to pink in male birds are sparse, but have been recorded anywhere from one to four years of age. Australian farmer and amateur ornithologist John Courtney proposed that the similarity between juvenile and female eye rings prevented adult males becoming aggressive to younger birds. He also observed the eye rings to flush brighter in aggressive males. Moulting appears to take place in stages over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> and is poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|The novel, {{described}} as a political, social and ethical commentary {{on the nature of}} good and evil, takes place in the Land of Oz, in the years leading to Dorothy's arrival. The story centers on Elphaba, the misunderstood, smart, and fiery girl of emerald-green skin who grows up to become the notorious Wicked Witch of the West and Galinda, the beautiful, blonde, popular girl who grows up to become Glinda the Good Witch of the South. The story is divided into five different sections based on the plot location and presents events, characters and situations from L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) and its 1939 film adaptation in new ways. It is designed to set the reader thinking about what it really is to be 'Wicked', and whether good intentions with bad results are the same as bad intentions with bad results. Schwartz considered how best to condense the novel's dense and complicated plot into a sensible script. To this end, he collaborated with Emmy Award–winning writer Winnie Holzman to develop the outline of the plot over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> while meeting with producer Marc Platt to refine the structural outline of the show, spinning an original stage piece rather than creating a strict adaptation of Maguire's work.|$|E
