5|$|According to the Athenian playwright Aeschylus, who {{actually}} fought at Salamis, the Greek fleet numbered 310 triremes (the difference being {{the number of}} Athenian ships). Ctesias claims that the Athenian fleet numbered only 110 triremes, which <b>ties</b> <b>in</b> with Aeschylus's numbers. According to Hyperides, the Greek fleet numbered only 220. The fleet was effectively {{under the command of}} Themistocles, but nominally led by the Spartan nobleman Eurybiades, as had been agreed at the congress in 481 BC. Although Themistocles had tried to claim leadership of the fleet, the other city states with navies objected, and so Sparta (which had no naval tradition) was given command of the fleet as a compromise.|$|E

5|$|Basel had {{remained}} studiously neutral {{throughout the whole}} war. Although allied with some cantons of the Swiss Confederacy, it also had strong economic <b>ties</b> <b>in</b> the Alsace and further down along the Rhine.

This {{was the first time that}} Great Britain had lost five <b>ties</b> <b>in</b> a row and was described as a humiliating Davis Cup defeat for Great Britain.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Two-layer {{intestinal}} anastomosis increases the inflammatory response while single-layer anastomosis {{results in a}} better wound healing. However the four main kinds of stitches which may be chosen in performing single layer intestinal sutures never before had been comparatively studied. AIM: To compare the four more commonly used types of single layer surgical anastomosis sutures of the digestive tract. METHODS: Six mongrel dogs were operated, each one receiving two anastomosis: one at 30 cm from de Treitz angle - sero-submucosal technique, and the other at 60 cm - total technique. This placement was alternatively inverted. The four more commonly used types of single layer surgical anastomosis sutures of the digestive tract, namely: sero-submucosal stitches <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> the lumen, over the submucosa; sero-submucosal stitches <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> {{the exterior of the}} organ, over the serosa; total stitches <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> the lumen, over the mucosa; and total sutures <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> the exterior, over the serosa (Gambee's stitches) were tested. After euthanasia (7 th post-operative day) macro and microscopic features were evaluated. Friedman's test was applied for morphometry and for evaluation of the peritoneal adhesions. RESULTS: Statistical significance was demonstrated through major residual acute inflammation and proliferation in total sutures and more profuse adhesions with the sero-submucosal stitches <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> the lumen. The sero-submucosal stitches <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> the exterior over the serosa, had excellent realignment and regeneration of the layers. CONCLUSION: The sero-submucosal stitches <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> the exterior, over the serosa, were the best ones...|$|R

5|$|NFL postseason {{history can}} be traced to the first NFL Championship Game in 1933, though in the early years, {{qualification}} for the game was based solely on regular season records. From 1933 to 1966, the NFL postseason generally only consisted of the NFL Championship Game, pitting the league's two division winners (pending any one-game playoff matches that needed to be held to break <b>ties</b> <b>in</b> the division standings). The NFL playoffs then expanded in 1967, when four teams qualified for the tournament. When the league merged with the American Football League (AFL) in 1970, the playoffs expanded to eight teams. The playoffs were expanded to 10 teams in 1978 and 12 teams since 1990.|$|E

5|$|Atlético only {{returned}} to official international football in 1992, {{taking part in}} the inaugural edition of the Copa CONMEBOL, a new competition organised by the continental confederation; the club earned a berth in the competition by finishing third in the 1991 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A. Copa CONMEBOL was contested among 16 teams, which played two-legged knockout <b>ties.</b> <b>In</b> the first round, Atlético eliminated fellow Brazilian side Fluminense with an aggregate score of 63, after a 21 away loss and a 51 home victory. The team then faced Colombia's Atlético Junior in the quarter-finals, advancing with a 52 aggregate score. Ecuadorian side El Nacional was the opponent in the semi-finals, in which Atlético lost the first leg at Quito by 10 and won the second at home by 20 to advance. Olimpia, a team which Atlético had already faced in two Copa Libertadores tournaments, was the club's opposition in the finals. After a 20 home win with a brace by Negrini at the Mineirão, and a 10 away defeat at the Defensores del Chaco, Atlético won its first official international trophy. Aílton, an Atlético forward, scored six goals in the competition and was its top goalscorer.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since its}} {{establishment}} Girdap served political interests, {{and it was}} later tied to the Popular Liberal Party of Stefan Stambolov. On the other hand, the Bulgarian Commercial Bank (Balgarska targovska banka), which was also founded in Ruse in 1885, {{was close to the}} Popular Party. The two banks competed for lending municipal loans and regularly used their political <b>ties</b> <b>in</b> their competition. These relations were often damaging to the Bulgarian treasury, as politicians who were also bank shareholders or somehow related to Girdap awarded contracts based on their personal interest rather than that of the state. As the Bulgarian economy consolidated {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century and the emerging industry required increasing funds, local banks grew in importance. In 1911 Girdap had a capital of 2 million leva and by 1912 it was the third-largest private bank in the Kingdom of Bulgaria after the Bulgarian Commercial Bank and the Deutsche Bank-related Credit Bank (Kreditna banka). However, Bulgaria's privately owned banking sector remained comparatively small.|$|E
5|$|From one {{settlement}} in year 1, the Han Dynasty's {{involvement in the}} Minyue region grew into several counties. There were many Chinese counties in the area by the 4th century AD. The Minyue had been culturally assimilated {{by the time the}} Han Dynasty collapsed, and Chinese civilization was undergoing a transition to the Three Kingdoms period of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. Political upheaval in the north, such as Wang Mang's usurpation, had caused Han migrants to resettle in the south. The Han Dynasty's military expansion widened its commercial <b>ties</b> <b>in</b> addition acquiring large amounts of new territories. The empire's conquest of Minyue and Nanyue spoke of its vast size that it bordered the ancient kingdoms of Southeast Asia. Economic ties with the Han and subsequent dynasties affected the trajectory of maritime trade of Southeast Asia, where goods have been excavated made in styles resembling that of the ancient Han Chinese. Maritime trade and the Silk Road also linked China with Ancient Rome, India, and the Near East.|$|E
