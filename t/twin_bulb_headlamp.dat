The daughter bulblets regenerated on <b>twin</b> <b>bulb</b> scales on 8 out of 9 regeneration treatment could be easily rooted on 1. 0 ×MS medium containing 4. 9 μM IBA (Indole- 3 -butyric acid). The daughter bulblets regenerated on 9 th treatment (1. 0 ×MS medium containing 17. 76 μM BAP plus 10. 74 μM NAA) were transferred to 1. 0 ×MS medium containing 30 g/l sucrose to break negative carry over effect of this dose of BAP–NAA, where they grew 2 – 3 roots of variable length. Daughter bulblet diameter was increased by culturing them on 1. 0 ×MS medium containing 4. 44 μM BAP plus 5. 37 μM NAA. The results verified that both age and the source of explants had significant effect on regeneration. In another set of experiments, twin scales were obtained from in vitro regenerated daughter bulblets, although they induced bulblets, yet their bulblet regeneration percentage, mean number of bulblets per explant and their diameter were significantly reduced. In vitro regenerated bulblets were acclimatized in growth chamber under ambient conditions of temperature and humidity on peat moss, where they flowered.

25|$|Technology {{moved forward}} {{in the rest of}} the world. The first halogen lamp for vehicle {{headlamp}} use, the H1, was introduced in 1962 by a European consortium of <b>bulb</b> and <b>headlamp</b> makers. Shortly thereafter, headlamps using the new light source were introduced in Europe. These were effectively prohibited in the US, where standard-size sealed beam headlamps were mandatory and intensity regulations were low. US lawmakers faced pressure to act, both due to lighting effectiveness and vehicle aerodynamics/fuel savings. High beam peak intensity, capped at 140,000 candela per side of the car in Europe, was limited in the United States to 37,500 candela on each side of the car until 1978, when the limit was raised to 75,000. An increase in high beam intensity to take advantage of the higher allowance could not be achieved without a move to halogen technology, and so sealed beam headlamps with internal halogen burners became available for use on 1979 models in the United States. Halogen sealed beams now dominate the sealed beam market, which has declined steeply since replaceable-bulb headlamps were permitted in 1983.|$|R

25|$|The first {{electric}} headlamp {{light source}} was the tungsten filament, {{operating in a}} vacuum or inert-gas atmosphere inside the <b>headlamp</b> <b>bulb</b> or sealed beam. Compared to newer-technology light sources, tungsten filaments give off small amounts of light relative to the power they consume. Also, during normal operation of such lamps, tungsten boils off {{the surface of the}} filament and condenses on the bulb glass, blackening it. This reduces the light output of the filament and blocks some of the light that would pass through an unblackened bulb glass, though blackening was less of a problem in sealed beam units; their large interior surface area minimized the thickness of the tungsten accumulation. For these reasons, plain tungsten filaments are all but obsolete in automotive headlamp service.|$|R

40|$|A Bayesian {{hierarchical}} model is proposed for modelling compositional data containing large concentrations of zeros. Two data transformations were used and compared: the commonly used additive log-ratio (alr) transformation for compositional data, and the square {{root of the}} compositional ratios. For this data the square root transformation was found to stabilise variability in the data better. The square root transformation also had no issues dealing with the large concentrations of zeros. To deal with the zeros, two different approaches have been implemented: the data augmentation approach and the composite model approach. The data augmentation approach treats any zero values as rounded zeros, i. e. traces of components below limits of detection, and updates those zero values with non-zero values. This {{is better than the}} simple approach of adding constant values to zeros as it reduces any artificial correlation produced by updating the zeros as part of the modelling procedure. However, due to the small detection limit it does not necessarily alleviate the problems of having a point mass very close to zero. The composite model approach treats any zero components as being absent from a composition. This is done by splitting the data into subsets according to {{the presence or absence of}} certain components to produce different data configurations that are then modelled separately. The models are applied to a database consisting of the elemental configurations of forensic glass fragments with many levels of variability and of various use types. The main purposes of the model are (i) to derive expressions for the posterior predictive probabilities of newly observed glass fragments to infer their use type (classification) and (ii) to compute the evidential value of glass fragments under two complementary propositions about their source (forensic evidence evaluation). Simulation studies using cross-validation are carried out to assess both model approaches, with both performing well at classifying glass fragments of use types <b>bulb,</b> <b>headlamp</b> and container, but less well so when classifying car and building windows. The composite model approach marginally outperforms the data augmentation approach at the classification task; both approaches have the edge over support vector machines (SVM). Both model approaches also perform well when evaluating the evidential value of glass fragments, with false negative and false positive error rates below 5 %. The results from glass classification and evidence evaluation are an improvement over existing methods. Assessment of the models as part of the evidence evaluation simulation study also leads to a restriction being placed upon the reported strength of the value of this type of evidence. To prevent strong support in favour of the wrong proposition it is recommended that this glass evidence should provide, at most, moderately strong support in favour of a proposition. The classification and evidence evaluation procedures are implemented into an online web application, which outputs the corresponding results for a given set of elemental composition measurements. The web application contributes a quick and easy-to-use tool for forensic scientists that deal with this type of forensic evidence in real-life casework...|$|R
