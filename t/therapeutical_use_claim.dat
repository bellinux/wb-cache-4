40|$|The {{medicinal}} plant, {{as well as}} the edible plant {{represents the}} most ancient botanical field of uman observation and experience. The knowledge of the species was born as knowledge of edible and healing plants. From the medicinal plants catalogues of Hippocrates and Dioscorides, to the first classification attempts by Aristotle, to the work of Theophrastus, the studied plant is the plant which possesses proved therapeutic activity. In the Middle Ages Mattioli translates Dioscorides describing and representing edible, aromatic and medicinal plants. The iconography representation of the studied species develops on one side with the herbarium descriptions, copy works often misrepresenting the morphological characters of the original representation, {{and on the other side}} with images inside artistic expressions not meant for scientific purposes, often related to complex symbologies. Therefore, the masterpiece of the past ages becomes a subject for study also from the botanical and the pharmacetical-botanical point of view. My contribution on the species of ethnobotanical interest in the paintings studied by the Genuese team of the Eu project “Plants in European Masterpieces” is derived from this thought: the examination of the past and present traditional and <b>therapeutical</b> <b>uses</b> of botanical species is understood as a mean of deep investigation and completing tool of the analysis of a masterpiece, as the ethnobotanical knowledge – the whole of people uses, traditions, beliefs and <b>therapeutical</b> <b>uses</b> – is of great interest in our history and consequently in the artistic expression...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} the neuropeptide met-enkephalin on histamine-induced bronhoconstriction in an experimental model of asthma. Classic Konzett and Rössler’s method of whole body plethysmography modified by Gjuriš, was applied in the study. This method represents a standard experimental model of bronchoconstriction, suitable for the evaluation of peptide effects on the histamine-induced bronchoconstriction. The results of the measurements implicate a dose-related modulatory effect of met-enkephalin on the bronchoconstrictor action of histamine. Met-enkephalin doses of 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively, caused statistically significant reduction of the histamine-induced bronchoconstriction. Estimated ED 50 dose was 0. 235 mg/kg.

40|$|Abstract The {{capacity}} to regenerate damaged tissue and appendages is lost {{to some extent}} in higher vertebrates such as mammals, which form a scar tissue at the expenses of tissue reconstitution and functionality. Whereas this process can protect from further damage and elicit fast healing, {{it can lead to}} functional deterioration in organs such as the heart. Based on the analyses performed in the last years, stem cell therapies may not be sufficient to induce cardiac regeneration and additional approaches are required to over-come scar formation. Among these, the immune cells and their humoral response have become a key parameter in regenerative processes. In this review, we will describe the recent findings on the possible <b>therapeutical</b> <b>use</b> of progenitor and immune cells to rescue a damaged heart...|$|R

In fact, apomorphine is useful in decreasing manic and schizophrenic symptoms, in diminishing abnormal involuntary movements in Huntingtonian patients and in other hyperkinetic syndromes.
