5|$|Cycling is an {{increasingly}} popular {{way to get}} around London. The launch of a cycle hire scheme in July 2010 has been successful and generally well received. The London Cycling Campaign lobbies for better provision. But in the central parts (The City & City of Westminster) are common cyclists a rare thing to see. Only messenger with helmets and sport bikes are seen <b>there.</b> <b>There</b> is a general lack of bike roads. Further out from the city centre is however lots of bikes parked around tube stations and other.|$|E
5|$|Gale married Henrietta Roper, the {{daughter}} of Henry Roper of Cowling, Kent. She died in 1720. They had one son, Roger Henry Gale, {{who was born in}} 1710. Gale himself died on 25 June 1744 at his estates in Scruton, and was buried near the church <b>there.</b> <b>There</b> is no monument in the churchyard, as he stipulated in his will that he be buried in such a manner that no one would know exactly where he was buried.|$|E

At {{the end of the}} garden, through a five-bar gate, there lay a five-acre meadow that also belonged to the property and had been let out to two local women for their horses.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurant}} {{is located on}} Broad Street {{in the town of}} Montgomery, Powys, a short distance from Montgomery Castle. There is a separate dining room and bar/lounge area in the restaurant. The dining room has low-slung beams, and an open brick fireplace, around which are placed Laura Ashley sofas. The chestnut wood flooring of the restaurant was created from a fallen tree on the Francis family farm. There is room to serve up to 40 diners, with 12 members of staff working <b>there.</b> <b>There</b> are three en-suite rooms available to hire on a hotel basis.|$|E

5|$|According to the 2001 census {{there are}} 16,595 Hungarians living in Croatia, {{representing}} 0.37 {{percent of the}} population.

The Hungarian minority in Croatia is recognised by the Constitution of Croatia; minority rights (including official use of Hungarian by local governments and education in Hungarian) are safeguarded by legislation enacted by the Sabor. Seven municipalities in Croatia introduced Hungarian for official use (either in part of their territory or the entire municipality), depending on the distribution of the Hungarian population <b>there.</b> <b>There</b> are five Hungarian minority organizations in Croatia, and the Hungarian minority is guaranteed one seat in the Croatian Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Egypt {{is rich in}} {{building}} and decorative stone, copper and lead ores, gold, and semiprecious stones. These natural resources allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments, sculpt statues, make tools, and fashion jewelry. Embalmers used salts from the Wadi Natrun for mummification, which also provided the gypsum needed to make plaster. Ore-bearing rock formations were found in distant, inhospitable wadis in the eastern desert and the Sinai, requiring large, state-controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found <b>there.</b> <b>There</b> were extensive gold mines in Nubia, {{and one of the}} first maps known is of a gold mine in this region. The Wadi Hammamat was a notable source of granite, greywacke, and gold. Flint was the first mineral collected and used to make tools, and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose. Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as sulfur as cosmetic substances.|$|E
5|$|In the 2012 presidential election, Republican nominee Mitt Romney earned over 50% of {{the vote}} in the precinct that {{included}} Trump Tower, one of two Manhattan voting precincts to do so (the other being the precinct that included the Waldorf Astoria New York hotel). However, although Trump received 23 votes in the district during the 2016 Republican primary, signifying the most votes of any Republican candidate <b>there,</b> <b>there</b> were 67 votes for his opponent Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary. In 2016, within the precinct that contained Trump Tower, 200 people voted for Clinton as opposed to 95 for Trump.|$|E

5|$|Joe Mayer {{was fired}} in 1937. He {{attributed}} this to the hatred of women {{on the part of}} the dean of physical sciences, which he thought was provoked by Goeppert Mayer's presence in the laboratory. Herzfeld agreed and added that, with Goeppert Mayer, Franck and Herzfeld all at Johns Hopkins, some thought that there were too many German scientists <b>there.</b> <b>There</b> were also complaints from some students that Mayer's chemistry lectures contained too much modern physics. Mayer took up a position at Columbia University, where the chairman of the Physics Department, George B. Pegram, arranged for Goeppert Mayer to have an office, but she received no salary. She soon made good friends with Harold Urey and Enrico Fermi, who arrived at Columbia in 1939. Fermi asked her to investigate the valence shell of the undiscovered transuranic elements. Using the Thomas–Fermi model, she predicted that they would form a new series similar to the rare earth elements. This proved to be correct.|$|E
5|$|Nell's story {{alternates}} {{between the}} perspectives of Nell Golightly, a seventeen-year-old girl, and the poet Rupert Brooke.

5|$|The Chartered Company's native commissioners {{began to}} fear a {{possible}} tribal rebellion during early 1915. Herbert Taylor, the chief native commissioner, believed that foreign missionaries were secretly encouraging rural black people {{to emulate the}} Chilembwe revolt in Nyasaland, and telling them (falsely) that the British were exterminating the natives <b>there.</b> <b>There</b> were few actual attempts to topple the administration in Southern Rhodesia, but the Company still took precautions. Aware that Mashona svikiro (spirit mediums) had been instrumental in inciting and leading insurgencies against Company rule during the late 1890s, the native commissioners enacted new legislation designed to imprison any svikiro who gained significant popularity.|$|E

5|$|The churchyard covers {{some two}} acres. Most of the headstones in the churchyard are modern – {{many of them}} are from the nineteenth century – but the churchyard, which is now closed to new interments, {{contains}} some old monuments. The whole churchyard and church is surrounded by what was once a typical sign of an early Celtic church; an oval formation of trees. There are also indications which suggest the remains of an early pond, probably for keeping fish for the priests and monks who once lived <b>there.</b> <b>There</b> is no visible trace of any conventual buildings (which would probably have been mostly relatively slight wooden structures, and never extensive). In the early nineteenth century Meyrick does however record the survival of what appeared to be stone monastic or church buildings.|$|E
5|$|In Chocobo Racing, {{the player}} {{controls}} Final Fantasy-inspired characters, {{most of whom}} race in go-karts. Other characters fly, drive scooters, ride magic carpets, or even run. Players have five different racing modes to choose from: Story Mode, Versus Mode, Grand Prix, Relay Race, and Time Attack. In the Story Mode, players are guided through the story of Chocobo Racing, which is narrated by Cid, {{in the form of}} an onscreen version of a pop-up book. Players who complete the Story Mode are given the chance to customize their own racer; completing the Story Mode also unlocks secret character racers. In the Versus Mode, two players can race each other on a horizontally split screen, where one player races viewing the top half of the screen and the other player races viewing the bottom half. In Grand Prix (GP) Mode, the player races computer-controlled opponents in four selected tracks of his or her choice. In Relay Race Mode, the player chooses three racers to compete in a relay match. In Time Attack Mode, the player can select any stage and try to beat the fastest time record set <b>there.</b> <b>There</b> are ten track options: Cid's Test Track, Moogle Forest, The Ancient Gate, Mythril Mines, The Black Manor, Floating Gardens, Gingerbread Land, Vulcan-O Valley, Fantasia, and F.F.VIII Circuit.|$|E

Joyce justified his proposal by saying:There's minerals <b>there,</b> <b>there's</b> gold, <b>there's</b> iron ore, <b>there's</b> coal, <b>there's</b> huge fish resources and what you have to ask is: 'Do I turn my head and allow another country to exploit my resource ... or do I position myself in such a way as I'm going to exploit it myself before they get there'.In defending his position Joyce argued that other nations did not recognise Australia's 42 per cent claim over Antarctica. The proposal was roundly criticised including by Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell and Labor Opposition spokesman, Anthony Albanese.|$|R
