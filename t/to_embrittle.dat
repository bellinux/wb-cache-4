This examines effect of H embrittlement by H 2 gas and moisture-bearing air on tensile properties and fatigue crack growth resistance of two ordered FeAl intermetallic alloys (28, 36 at. % Al) and one disordered Fe-Al alloy (16 at. % Al). Susceptibility to embrittlement varies with both Al content and ordered state. Tensile ductility of disordered low Al alloy is {{not affected by}} moisture-bearing air, and fatigue crack growth resistance is affected only slightly by moisture. However, the higher Al alloys are severely embrittled by moisture-bearing air. Oxidation of Al with concurrent release of H 2 is responsible for embrittlement of Fe 3 Al alloys. It {{is likely that the}} smaller amount of Al available for the oxidation reaction in the 16 at. % alloy precludes such embrittling reactions. In contrast, H 2 is found <b>to</b> be <b>embrittling</b> <b>to</b> all alloys in both cyclic and monotonic tests. Fractography shows that H 2 preferentially attacks cleavage planes in these alloys. Inherent fatigue crack growth resistance in an inert environment of the low Al disordered alloy is found to be much lower than that for the high Al alloys. Fatigue crack growth rate in an embrittling environment can be expressed as superposed mechanical fatigue and corrosion-fatigue components. Fatigue crack growth tests in inert and embrittling environments are used to isolate corrosion fatigue of the crack growth rate in Fe- 28 at. %Al. The corrosion-fatigue component displays a frequency dependence: At lower frequencies, more time is available for penetration of H ahead of the crack tip. H transport in the Fe-Al alloys occurs primarily by dislocation-assisted transport, which allows for penetration depths of 10 - 100 x the distance that can be achieved by bulk diffusion.

An evaluation of surveillance samples from the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) had suggested that some materials used for RPV supports in pressurized-water reactors could exhibit higher than expected embrittlement rates. However, further tests designed to evaluate the applicability of the HFIR data to reactor RPV supports under operating conditions led to the conclusion that RPV supports could be evaluated using traditional method. It was found that the unique HFIR radiation environment allowed the gamma radiation to contribute significantly to the embrittlement. The shielding provided by the thick steel RPV shell ensures that degradation of RPV supports from gamma irradiation is improbable or minimal.

The intent of this report is to present a methodology comparable to the ASME Code for ensuring the prevention of nonductile fracture of the CPBT in the ANS reactor. 6061 -T 6 aluminum is known to be a relatively brittle material; the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) approach is utilized to determine allowable flaw sizes for the CPBT.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{hydrogen}} can have a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties of metals. The aim here is to provide a fully coupled model of the HELP (Hydrogen Enhanced Local Plasticity) mechanism with hydrogen transport. Using the similarities between the heat and mass diffusion equations, a coupled temperature-displacement procedure has been adopted to allow the coupling between hydrogen diffusion and the mechanical behaviour of the material to be simulated. The diffusion equation takes into account the fact that hydrogen atoms reside in interstitial sites and in trapping sites such as dislocations. In the simulations presented here it is assumed that concentration of hydrogen at the dislocations is in equilibrium with the concentration in the matrix interstitial sites. The mechanical behaviour of the material is represented by an isotropic hardening law in which the flow stress decreases with increasing hydrogen content in the matrix which is evaluated by solving the fully coupled mechanical diffusion equations. We use the model to analyse the response of a plane strain component which contains deep and sharp doubled-edged notches. For highly constrained components of this type the hydrostatic component of stress scales with the local yield strength of the material. A high local hydrostatic stress would result in a high hydrogen concentration, but a high hydrogen concentration results in softening, i. e. a low yield strength, and therefore a low hydrostatic stress. These conflicting relationships result in a balance being achieved between hydrostatic stress, hydrogen concentration and yield strength, i. e. the response does not become unstable. Also there is a high degree of kinematic determinacy in the way which the component deforms, i. e. the strain pattern in the presence of hydrogen is very similar to that when there is no hydrogen. A consequence of these two effects is that softening of the constitutive response due to the presence of hydrogen, does not lead to localization of strain and a macroscopic brittle response. Softening must be combined with other degradation process for the material <b>to</b> <b>embrittle...</b>|$|E

In impurity atoms that are empirically known <b>to</b> be <b>embrittler</b> (N and O) we found that the 2 s orbital is bound to the impurity and therefore does not participate in the covalent bonding.

40|$|Hydrogen has the {{potential}} of increased use in the future as an environmentally friendly fuel. It has, however, shown a tendency <b>to</b> <b>embrittle</b> some materials. To be used in a safe manner and to exploit its full potential, {{it will be necessary to}} develop a database of material properties in hydrogen environment. The tests needed to produce this data are costly to perform (tensile test cost 25 times more and low cycle fatigue test are 55 times as expensive). Moreover, there is presently a lack of universal test methods to ensure standardized data within the hydrogen community. Each of the industries that work with hydrogen (aerospace, petroleum, fuel cells, etc.) performs tests by their own laboratory-developed methods, thus rendering cross- comparisons of material property data highly questionable. It is extremely important that data generated in a hydrogen environment be done to a standard that reduces variance to a minimum and allows direct comparison of test results from different laboratories. Doing so will assure that all data generated can be used to further our understanding of the hydrogen effects and to make sure components/products designed for hydrogen are the safest and most reliable possible. This paper reviews the results of two 'round-robin' programs conducted by NASA-MSFC. These two programs examined the reproducibility and repeatability of tensile and low-cycle fatigue test results in high-pressure hydrogen environments. The studies indicated that even with the tightest controls available from current commercial standards, the reproducibility (between different laboratories) and repeatability (within a laboratory) results of the tensile tests exhibited five times the variance as in standard ambient air tests. The variance with the LCF tests were on the same order as with air tests, but that was due to the large variation present in the last Interlaboratory air program. The paper concludes with a recommendation for a program that would allow the development of improved test methods, leading to lower variance in the generation of mechanical property data in the future...|$|E

In {{an effort to reduce}} costs, the pursuit to down-gauge packaging materials is constant. In the case of this study, the primary package of a dairy product is being considered for reduction from the current 57 mil thickness to 52 mils. In the past, as the material was down-gauged from 62 mils, a loss in material strength and an increase in damage were observed. Initial research into the issue by line personnel found that the increase in damage was occurring when the forming equipment stopped running and material was held in the hydrogen peroxide (H 202) and heating tunnels for extended amounts of time. Further investigation confirmed that extended durations of the material submerged in the H 202 sterilization tank caused the material <b>to</b> <b>embrittle.</b> Therefore, this study was constructed {{to determine the effects of}} H 202 on two materials, polystyrene and polypropylene, and at two thickness 2 ̆ 7, 57 and 52 mils, and 55 and 50 mils, respectively.

It was expected that these properties would decrease as the exposure was increased, but the results did not demonstrate that. The polystyrene based material exhibited very little, or no, change in mechanical properties that could be attributed to H 202. Indications were that any variations in mechanical properties were based more on other factors, such as materials impurities or variations in the extrusion process, than the exposure to H 202.

40|$|Tubes {{fabricated}} from dilute Zr-alloys {{serve as}} miniature pressure vessels in Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors and {{are subjected to}} stress, aqueous corrosion and intense irradiation during service. Hydrogen evolved during the corrosion reaction may enter into the material and precipitate as hydride phase, which acquire platelet shaped morphology in Zr-alloys and are known <b>to</b> <b>embrittle</b> the host matrix. Since hydride embrittlement is a major life limiting factor for the components made from these alloys, several theoretical and experimental studies {{have been carried out}} to understand the influence of hydrogen/hydride on the mechanical properties in general and micromechanisms assisting crack nucleation and its propagation in the presence of hydride, in particular. For ductile materials like Zr-alloys, crack initiation follows void nucleation and its growth in the plastic zone. Nucleation of voids is associated with fracture of second phase particle or separation of matrix-precipitate interface. Hydrides are suspected to be fracture initiating sites in Zr-alloys and the presence of hydride platelets normal to tensile load significantly influences crack propagation. However, the role of hydrides in crack nucleation and its propagation and influence of temperature on the same has not been delineated clearly. In this work, influence of hydrogen and temperature on the axial fracture toughness parameters of Zr- 2. 5 Nb pressure tube alloys is reported. The fracture toughness tests were carried out using 17 mm width curved compact tension specimens machined from gaseously hydrogen charged tube-sections and tested in the temperature range of 306 to 573 K. Metallography of the samples revealed that hydrides were predominantly oriented along axial-circumferential plane of the tube. The fracture toughness parameters like JQ, J 0. 15, JMax, J 1. 5, dJ/da, KJC and KMax were determined as per the ASTM standard E- 813, with the crack length measured using direct current potential drop technique. The plane strain K values were computed from the corresponding J values. The critical crack length for catastrophic failure was determined using a numerical method, which is widely used in literature. It is observed that for a given test temperature both the fracture toughness parameters representing crack initiation, such as JQ, J 0. 15 and KJC and crack propagation, such as JMax, J 1. 5, and KMax, decrease mildly with increase in hydrogen content whereas mean dJ/da is practically unaffected by hydrogen content. Also, for a given hydrogen content crack initiation fracture toughness parameters showed large scatter with a tendency to decrease with increase in test temperature whereas the crack propagation fracture toughness parameters increased with temperature to a saturation value...|$|E
40|$|Described is {{a program}} for {{development}} of coolant passage geometries, material systems, and joining processes that will produce long-life hydrogen-cooled structures for scramjet applications. Tests were performed to establish basic material properties, and samples constructed and evaluated to substantiate fabrication processes and inspection techniques. Results of the study show that the basic goal of increasing the life of hydrogen-cooled structures two orders of magnitude relative {{to that of the}} Hypersonic Research Engine can be reached with available means. Estimated life is 19000 cycles for the channels and 16000 cycles for pin-fin coolant passage configurations using Nickel 201. Additional research is required to establish the fatigue characteristics of dissimilar-metal coolant passages (Nickel 201 /Inconel 718) and <b>to</b> investigate the <b>embrittling</b> effects of the hydrogen coolant...|$|R
40|$|A {{test method}} has been devised that initiates and propagates {{a crack in}} polymer {{materials}} that avoids the need of an impact device. This is {{to take advantage of}} the good thermal insulation properties of polymers and similar materials and their tendency <b>to</b> be <b>embrittled</b> when cooled <b>to</b> low temperatures. Crack initiation in an embrittled part of the specimen is a simple process and it can be arranged for the crack to then propagate into the main part of the specimen which can have a variety of different shapes and include bonded joints and other features. Also, the stress loading for the main part of the specimen can be varied to relate to the different conditions in which a material may be employed. With impact testers, that also apply dynamically a three-point bend or other test condition then a problem can be in determining how much the crack initiation and propagation is due to the impact transient forces relative to the three-point bending or other loading of the specimen. Although impact testing is a very useful and realistic test, it can be difficult to determine precisely the threshold of crack initiation and propagation and other key factors that the proposed test method achieves. In many ways, impact testing and the proposed method complement each other...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Metallized Teflon ® FEP (fluorinated {{ethylene}} propylene) {{thermal control}} material on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) {{has been found to}} be degrading in the space environment. Teflon ® FEP thermal control blankets (space-facing FEP) retrieved during the first servicing mission (SM 1) were found <b>to</b> be <b>embrittled</b> on solar-facing surfaces and contained microscopic cracks. During the second servicing mission (SM 2) astronauts noticed that the FEP outer layer of the multi-layer insulation (MLI) covering the telescope was cracked in many locations around the telescope. Large cracks were observed on the light shield, forward shell and equipment bays. A tightly curled piece of cracked FEP from the light shield was retrieved during SM 2 and was severely embrittled, as witnessed by ground testing. A failure review board was organized to determine the mechanism causing the MLI degradation. Density, x-ray crystallinity and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses of the FEP retrieved during SM 1 were inconsistent with results of FEP retrieved during SM 2. Because the retrieved SM 2 material was curled while in space, it experienced a higher temperature extreme during thermal cycling, estimated at 200 C, than the SM 1 material, estimated at 50 C. An investigation on the effects of heating pristine FEP and FEP retrieved from the HST was therefore conducted. Samples of pristine, SM 1 an...|$|R
