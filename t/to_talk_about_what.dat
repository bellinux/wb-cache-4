More than anything, I want them to affect our doctors in heartbreaking and beautiful ways." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 90s, new manga author Masashi Kishimoto {{sought to}} write a {{one-shot}} chapter that would feature Naruto as a chef, but this version {{never made it to}} print. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of Naruto for the summer 1997 issue of Akamaru Jump magazine based on the idea. For the serialized version, Kishimoto incorporated traits he felt made an ideal hero in the creation of Naruto: a straightforward way of thinking, a mischievous side, and attributes possessed by Goku from the Dragon Ball franchise. Aiming to keep Naruto [...] "simple and stupid", Kishimoto avoided modeling him after anyone in particular, instead conceiving of him as naïve with a dark side resulting from his harsh past. Despite this, he is always optimistic, a trait Kishimoto said makes this character unique. By and large, Naruto's personality is childish; the creator tried to convey this trait in his illustrations. Kishimoto notes as an example of this the cover of volume 10, where Kishimoto depicts Naruto mimicking a turtle as a child might do. Naruto was Kishimoto's first published manga, and he focused on making Naruto's facial expressions consistent in difficult situations. He commented: [...] "It's rather awkward <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> makes Naruto appealing to audiences, but I think his being a knucklehead gives him an appeal." [...] He believed it was Naruto's losses that made readers identify with him, although he wanted Naruto not to feel defeat again, which was his primary aim when writing the series. Kishimoto has said that Naruto's burning desire to be a ninja was based on his own ambition to succeed as a manga artist.|$|E

2500|$|Screenwriter Boal {{described}} the pro-torture accusations as [...] "preposterous", stating that [...] "it's just misreading {{the film to}} say that it shows torture leading to the information about bin Laden", while director Bigelow added: [...] "Do I wish [...] was not part of that history? Yes. But it was." [...] In February 2013 in the Wall Street Journal, Boal responded to the Senate critics, being quoted as saying [...] "oes that mean they can use the movie as a political platform <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they've been wanting to talk about {{for years and years and}} years? Do I think that Feinstein used the movie as a publicity tool to get a conversation going about her report? I believe it, ..." [...] referring to the intelligence committee's report on enhanced interrogations. He also said the senators' letter showed they were still concerned about public opinion supporting the effectiveness of torture and didn't want the movie reinforcing that. Boal said, though, [...] "I don't think that [...] issue has really been resolved" [...] if there is a suspect with possible knowledge of imminent attack who will not talk.|$|E
2500|$|In her {{scholarly}} monograph, Laurie Halse Anderson: Speaking in Tongues, Wendy J. Glenn {{claims that}} Speak [...] "has generated more academic response {{than any other}} novel Anderson has written." [...] Despite hesitancy to teach a novel with [...] "mature subject matter," [...] English teachers are implementing Speak in the classroom as a study of literary analysis, as well as tool to teach students about sexual harassment. The novel gives {{students the opportunity to}} talk about several teen issues, including: school cliques, sex, and parental relationships. Of teaching Speak in the classroom Jackett says, [...] "We have the opportunity as English teachers to have an enormously positive impact on students' lives. Having the courage to discuss the issues found in Speak is one way to do just that." [...] By sharing in Melinda's struggles, students may find their own voices and learn to cope with trauma and hardships. According to Janet Alsup, teaching Speak in the classroom, can help students become more critically literate. Students may not feel comfortable talking about their own experiences, but they are willing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> happens to Melinda. Elaine O'Quinn claims that books like Speak allow students to explore inner dialogue. Speak provides an outlet for students to think critically about their world.|$|E
