Massalia became a {{thriving}} trading center and a major rival of Carthage for <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>markets</b> and the tin trade through Gaul. The Phocaeans also planted a colony in Alalia in Corsica around 562 BC. When the city of Phocaea itself fell to Cyrus the Great of Persia in 546 BC, most Phoceans moved to Alalia, partly because they were on good terms with the Greek colonies along the Strait of Messina and had even been granted toll-free passage. Later, after the battle, in 540 BC, they founded Elea in southern Italy (Magna Grecia).|$|E

Furthermore, the market rebound is much quicker in London compared to <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>markets</b> where the attackers were not suicide bombers. Nevertheless, the overall findings point to only a transitory impact on return and volatility that does not last for a long period. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Our study {{examines}} whether behavioural theories can explain post-earnings announcement drift (i. e. earnings momentum) in <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>market.</b> In particular, we test models proposed by Barberis et al. (Journal of Financial Economics, 49, pp. 307 - 343, 1998), Daniel et al. (Journal of Finance, 53 (6), pp. 1839 - 1885, 1998) and Hong and Stein (Journal of Finance, 54 (6), pp. 2143 - 2184, 1999). Each of these behavioural models draws on two premises - cognitive biases and limits to arbitrage - that we assume will vary with a given country's cultural and institutional features. Therefore, we must exercise caution when extrapolating the favourable results {{observed in the}} US market to markets outside of the USA. Our results provide little {{evidence in support of}} the hypothesis used to test whether these models can indeed explain the earnings momentum anomaly in <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>market.</b> We believe some characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>market,</b> such as its lower score on the Individualism Index, lower levels of investor protection and code-law-based legal system, may explain why our results differ from those obtained in the USA. ...|$|R

Moreover, positive abnormal returns are observed around announcement dates and around the ex-date.
