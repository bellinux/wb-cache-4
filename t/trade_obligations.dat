Their only threat was the possibility of theft from brigands when their ships and caravans traveled to distant lands. Powerful South Indian merchant guilds included the Manigramam, the Nagarattar and the Anjuvannam. Local guilds were called nagaram, while the Nanadesis were traders from neighbouring kingdoms who perhaps mixed business with pleasure. The wealthiest and most influential and celebrated of all South Indian merchant guilds was the self-styled Ainnurruvar, {{also known as the}} 500 Svamis of Ayyavolepura (Brahmins and Mahajanas of present-day Aihole), who conducted extensive land and sea trade and thereby contributed significantly to the total foreign trade of the empire.

Five hundred such excavated Prasasti inscriptions, with their own flag and emblem, the bull, record their pride in their business.|$|E

In order to introduce and analyse the topic thoroughly at first the main legal acts connected with relationships of <b>obligation</b> and <b>trade</b> relationships of <b>obligations</b> in both compared countries are being introduced. The main stress is put {{on the content of}} these legal acts, on their historical development, their application methods as well as on their mutual relationship. The next part of this Master thesis then explains the term <b>trade</b> relationship of <b>obligation</b> with respect to the definitions obtained in both compared legal systems. After the theoretical introduction the general legal regulation of the <b>trade</b> relationships of <b>obligation</b> is being characterised. Since the general legal regulation of the <b>trade</b> relationships of <b>obligation</b> is based on the general legal regulation of the relationships of obligation at first the differences between these two legal regulations in Germany are explained.

If the independent World Trade Organization Advisory Board, made up of a panel of international law and trade experts, finds that the importing nation has a legitimate complaint, enforces said ethical standards for domestic production, and isn't trying to merely skirt its free <b>trade</b> <b>obligations,</b> then the Board will rule that trade barriers are justified.

40|$|Objective to {{identify}} and analyze {{the changes in the}} legal regulation of financial markets in the EU which occurred as a result of continuous reforms one of the key steps of which was the adoption of Directive 201465 EC ldquoOn financial tools marketsrdquo. This document defines the framework for transactions with derivative financial instruments. 	Methods formallegal comparative historical analytical methods of scientific cognition. 	Results it was found that Regulation No. 6002014 EU of the European Parliament and of the EU Council ldquoOn the financial tools marketsrdquo introduced the <b>trading</b> <b>obligation</b> to transactions with derivative financial instruments that is the rules on signing contracts on a certain type of regulated platforms. These platforms include regulated markets multilateral and organized trading platforms as well as similar platforms registered in the third states. The delegated regulations of the European Commission define the criteria for the diffusion of <b>trading</b> <b>obligations</b> onto various types of financial derivatives. At the moment it is impossible to fully evaluate the innovations results as most of the provisions and secondary legal acts have not yet come into force or have not been adopted. However {{it is clear that the}} reform of 2014 will not leave the derivatives market in its previous state. Directive No. 201465 EU and Regulation No. 6002014 EU ldquoOn financial tools marketsrdquo produced a revolution for them. 	The <b>trading</b> <b>obligation</b> imposed by these documents has forced the parties involved into transactions with derivative financial instruments to adopt a new perspective on their activities. As a result of the innovation a huge part of transactions with them has to be transferred onto regulated platforms and the OTC contracts for many will become illegal.

5000|$|The {{beginning}} of the Middle Woodland saw a shift of settlement to the Interior. As the Woodland period progressed, local and inter-regional trade of exotic materials greatly increased {{to the point where}} a trade network covered most of the Eastern United States. Throughout the Southeast and north of the Ohio River, burial mounds of important people were very elaborate and contained a variety of mortuary gifts, many of which were not local. The most archaeologically certifiable sites of burial during this time were in Illinois and Ohio. These have {{come to be known as}} the Hopewell tradition. Due to the similarity of earthworks and burial goods, researchers assume a common body of religious practice and cultural interaction existed throughout the entire region (referred to as the [...] "Hopewellian Interaction Sphere"). Such similarities could also be the result of reciprocal <b>trade,</b> <b>obligations,</b> or both between local clans that controlled specific territories. Access to food or resources outside a clan's territory would be made possible through formal agreements with neighbors. Clan heads would then be buried along with goods received from their trading partners to symbolize the relationships they had established. Under this scenario, permanent settlements would be likely to develop, leading to increased agricultural production and a population increase.|$|E

40|$|The Doha {{declaration}} {{on trade}} and environment proposed to clarify the relationship between multilateral environmental agreement (MEA) <b>trade</b> <b>obligations</b> and WTO rules by only guaranteeing economic integration upon ratification of certain MEAs.

This paper demonstrates that the Doha proposal can be effective when environmental policy and its <b>trade</b> <b>obligations</b> are endogenous. Under plausible circumstances, ratification by a non-signatory to the MEA along with free trade as a reward is the unique equilibrium outcome. Delocation to pollution havens does not occur, as optimal tariffs are positive if standards are not adopted. Tariffs however only work as a credible threat and do not emerge in equilibrium. Results are consistent with broad empirical evidence that opposes the pollution haven hypothesis and suggests capital movements to be non-pollution related.

Law protection is basic need for investor, moreover, investor of corporation obligation invest its capital in huge number. By this protection, investor can play safely in capital market especially instrument of obligation. Form of this protection will give effect in investor will to play obligation in capital market, that absolutely responsible to many risks. So, it can attract other investors to join in capital market especially obligation whether it is government obligation of corporation obligation. But, in practice, {{there are a lot of}} violations that use latest system, which is, trading system in Scriptless Trading. The ways of violation is very modern; in fact, most of it is because of emiten behavior that is not responsible by purpose for personal sake that makes investor has no profit and declines investor interest toward capital market. The purposes of this study are to know about how is the implementation of obligation marketing without Scriptless Trading in Bursa Efek Surabaya, and to investigate about how law protection toward obligation investor in having <b>obligation</b> <b>trading</b> without Scriptless Trading in Bursa Efek Surabaya. Method of study used is juridical sociology. Analytic descriptive method is describing facts that is gained from the result of investigation in field or even by documentation and libraryan study to have conclusion. Based on the result of study can get result as follow: <b>Obligation</b> <b>trading</b> in Bursa Efek Surabaya consists of two kinds of obligation trading; they are obligation in stock exchange (The Counter) and outside of stock exchange (Over The Counter). But, in practice, investors and emiten more use <b>obligation</b> <b>trading</b> out of stock exchange (Over The Counter). Then, <b>obligation</b> <b>trading</b> in Surabaya uses trading system OTC-FITS, where trading system is specialized for <b>obligation</b> <b>trading</b> in Scriptless Trading.
