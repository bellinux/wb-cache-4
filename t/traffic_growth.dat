30|$|The upgrade of UMTS {{networks}} to HSPA allows for MNOs to provide reliable high speed data services, dubbed 'mobile broadband'. A variety of smartphones (particularly the iPhone) provided an enriched user experience, and together with flat-rate pricing for mobile broadband, {{were among the}} reasons why mobile broadband took off when it did. Since then, mobile operators have been reporting annual <b>traffic</b> <b>growths</b> over their networks ranging from 300 to 700 % [11]. Besides {{an increase in the}} number of broadband users, each user is consuming more traffic, which can be attributed to {{an increase in the number}} of available devices (e.g., eBook readers, laptops, GPS systems, cars), and the amount of dedicated content, especially multimedia (e.g., YouTube) and social networking (e.g., Facebook), being made available.|$|R

25|$|Despite the expansions, {{efforts have}} been made to {{restrict}} the growth of the airport. The advent of jet aircraft as well as <b>traffic</b> <b>growth</b> led Congress to pass the Washington Airport Act of 1950, which resulted in the opening of Dulles Airport in 1962. To reduce congestion and drive traffic to alternative airports, the FAA imposed landing slot and perimeter restrictions on National and four other high-density airports in 1969.|$|E
