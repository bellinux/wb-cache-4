5|$|Another {{quantum effect}} that predicts the {{occurrence}} of faster-than-light speeds is called the Hartman effect; under certain conditions <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> for a virtual particle to tunnel through a barrier is constant, regardless of {{the thickness of the}} barrier. This could result in a virtual particle crossing a large gap faster-than-light. However, no information can be sent using this effect.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of the first effective anti-aircraft missiles by the late 1950s changed this picture dramatically. Missiles could stand ready for immediate launch, eliminating operational delays like <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> to get the pilot into the cockpit of a fighter. Guidance did not require wide-area tracking or calculation of an intercept course: a simple comparison of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> to fly to the altitude of the target returned the required deflection. Missiles also had greater altitude capability than any aircraft, and improving this to adapt to new aircraft was a low-cost development path. The US was aware of Soviet work in the field, and had reduced the expected operational lifetime of the U-2, knowing that it would become vulnerable to these missiles as they were improved. This later happened with the 1960 downing of the U-2 flown by Gary Powers.|$|E
5|$|A gas {{explosion}} {{in a residential}} area of Rosario, the third-largest city in Argentina, occurred on August 6, 2013. It {{was caused by a}} large gas leak; a nearby building collapsed, and others were at high risk of structural failure. Twenty-two people died, and sixty were injured. Several organizations helped secure the area, search for survivors and aid people who lost their homes. Shortly after the explosion, <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> for reconstruction was estimated at six months.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large {{part due to the}} withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the new {{application of the}} classical occupancy problem to the establishments of ad hoc wireless local area networks. A contention-based algorithm called uniform for network setups is introduced in this paper. The major evaluation criterion for this algorithm is <b>the</b> contention <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> to complete <b>the</b> initial establishment of a network. This paper obtains the exact recursive solution for <b>the</b> contention <b>time</b> <b>needed.</b> It also derives the asymptotic lower and upper bounds for <b>the</b> average <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> by repeatedly using results from the classical occupancy problem. A simulation study is performed to confirm the asymptotic results. ...|$|R
30|$|In a {{heterogeneous}} network, <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>needed</b> {{to execute a}} service differ from node to node, such that an adaption of <b>the</b> <b>times</b> is <b>needed.</b> This {{can be done by}} a simple factor as proposed in [14], where every node indicates a speed grade that is multiplied with <b>the</b> service execution <b>time.</b> A more exact approach would be to store a service execution time table on every node, which the service manager uses to determine whether the assigned service network is actually executable.|$|R
5|$|Booth's {{performances}} saw him {{selected for}} a second choice Australian team that toured New Zealand under the captaincy of Ian Craig. He scored 105 in his first innings for his country, in a victory over Auckland. Booth scored 184 runs at 30.66 and took three wickets at 25.00 in the four international matches against New Zealand. Booth considered retiring after the season, feeling that <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> for first-class cricket was impinging on {{his work as a}} lay preacher and a Christian youth worker.|$|E
5|$|Challenge mode employs similar {{gameplay}} {{to that of}} the Story mode. The {{difference is}} that the gameplay for Challenge mode is faster-paced, offers more puzzles, and sacrifices any storyline in this mode. It consists of 30 levels and players must fulfill certain conditions before succeeding. Each level lasts only a few minutes, offering more exciting, yet harder, gameplay. <b>The</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> for players to complete a level is recorded in an online leaderboard which can be viewed by other players.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} to Martlesham, Dowding {{outlined}} his concerns about night interceptions and {{the characteristics of a}} proper night fighter. Since the interceptions were long affairs, the aircraft needed to have long endurance. To ensure that friendly fire was not an issue, pilots would be required to identify all targets visually. This meant a separate radar operator would be needed, so the pilot would not lose his night vision by looking at the CRTs. And finally, since <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> to arrange an interception was so long, the aircraft required armament that could guarantee destruction of a bomber in a single pass—there was little chance a second interception could be arranged.|$|E

5|$|Outer {{space is}} a {{convenient}} setting {{for measuring the}} speed of light because of its large scale and nearly perfect vacuum. Typically, one measures <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> for light to traverse some reference distance in the solar system, such as the radius of the Earth's orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units.

5|$|The B-70 {{was planned}} to use a high-speed, high-altitude bombing {{approach}} that followed a trend of bombers flying progressively faster and higher {{since the start of}} manned bomber use. Through that same period, only two weapons proved effective against bombers: fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA). Flying higher and faster made it more difficult for both; higher speeds allowed the bomber to fly out of range of the weapons more quickly, while higher altitudes increased <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> for fighters to climb to the bombers, and greatly increased the size of the AAA weapons needed to reach those altitudes.|$|E

5|$|The {{book was}} the result of several years of research, {{prompted}} by Longman, who had published Acton's Poems. Many of the recipes came from her friends. Modern Cookery quickly became a bestselling work, appearing in several editions and remaining a standard cookery book {{throughout the rest of the}} century. The book was immensely influential, establishing the format for modern cookery book writing, by listing the exact ingredients required for each recipe, <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed,</b> and potential problems that might arise. This was a major departure from previous cookbooks, which were less precise.|$|E
5|$|The braking a is from {{an initial}} speed u {{to a final}} speed v, over a length of time t.

5|$|Little to {{no major}} {{modifications}} {{were made to}} the two active Colorados in the opening months of the U.S.'s entry into the war; all of the battleships in the Pacific Fleet had a constant order to be ready to sail within 48 hours in case of a Japanese attempt to invade Hawaii or the West Coast and could not be spared for any major yard work. Colorado was hurried through the rest of her refit with the addition of essential items like radar, splinter protection, 14 Oerlikon 20mm and four 1.1in light anti-aircraft guns; Maryland received a similar treatment later, the only difference being 16 20mm's and no 1.1in. Although tower masts were constructed for Colorado and Maryland and a majority of the old cage masts were cut down by the ships' crews in the beginning of 1942, the ships could not be spared <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> to install the new masts. The tower masts were placed into storage and not used until early 1944.|$|E
5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} are {{at about}} twice {{the risk of being}} involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus {{in many areas of the}} world are not allowed to drive or only able to drive if certain conditions are met. In some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to the licensing body while in others the requirement is only that they encourage the person in question to report it themselves. Countries that require physician reporting include Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Spain. Countries that require the individual to report include the UK and New Zealand and the physician may report if they believe the individual has not already. In Canada, the United States and Australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state. If seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving is reasonable. The amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country. Many countries require one to three years without seizures. In the United States <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method is}} to use the {{aberration}} of light, discovered and explained by James Bradley in the 18th century. This effect results from the vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5 arcseconds) it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth's velocity around the Sun, which with the known length of a year can be converted to <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> to travel from the Sun to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8minutes 12seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.|$|E
