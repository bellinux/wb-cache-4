5|$|In 1846 {{the first}} railway line reached Richmond. Richmond Gasworks opened in 1848, and Richmond began <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> a {{significant}} town. The District Railway (later the District line) reached Richmond in 1877, connecting {{it to the}} London Underground. Commuting to central London became feasible and affordable, leading to further population growth in the previously relatively isolated Richmond and Twickenham areas.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance was observed on November19 about 800km (500mi) southeast of Colombo, Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal. The disturbance tracked westward, gradually organizing and prompting the JTWC {{to issue a}} Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on November22. After passing south of Sri Lanka, it became disorganized and was no longer considered likely <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> a tropical cyclone. The circulation associated with the system continued westward, reorganizing on November26 in the Arabian Sea. Despite being located unusually close to the equator, the disturbance maintained convection, or thunderstorms, which was becoming organized around the weak low-level circulation. With low wind shear and diffluence aloft, the JTWC remarked the system had a fair chance of developing.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{entered the}} Atlantic Ocean from Africa on July 10, and the wave developed {{into an area}} of low pressure while passing over Cape Verde. Despite the organization, the low failed <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> a tropical cyclone due to cool waters on the sea surface and wind shear. However, those unfavorable conditions did not completely destroy the wave, as it continued traveling westward through the Lesser Antilles until July 18. That day, while south of Puerto Rico, the wave split in two; the northern half moved northwest and developed into Tropical Storm Franklin over the Bahamas, and the southern half continued westward, with its associated thunderstorm activity increasing.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on July9, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began {{dispatching}} aircraft reconnaissance {{to investigate}} {{an area of}} thunderstorms between Yap State and Koror that had potential <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> a tropical cyclone. Tracking westward, there were few signs of organization or intensification until July12, when recon found a closed atmospheric circulation within the disturbance, signifying that a tropical depression had developed; JTWC bulletins and warnings commenced accordingly. Upon development, observations indicated that the system was quickly developing in favorable conditions, with initial reconnaissance flights finding a loose eye measuring 160km (100mi) in diameter shortly after classification as a tropical depression. Twelve hours later, the JTWC upgraded the cyclone to tropical storm status, assigning the name Billie.|$|E
5|$|Driven {{by early}} {{enjoyment}} of the media coverage of cricket, Agnew developed a love for playing the game. At the end of days spent watching cricket on television in a blacked-out room with the commentary provided by the radio, Agnew {{would go into the}} garden and practise his bowling for hours, trying to imitate the players he had seen. Agnew's father, an amateur cricketer, taught him the rudiments of the sport, including an offspin action, as he wanted his son <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> a bowler like him. Another family connection to cricket was his first cousin, Mary Duggan, who was a women's Test player for England from 1948 to 1963.|$|E

The day was spent in confusion; conflicting orders were issued and Horne travelled to the division to clarify his intentions. In the end, no attack was launched.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} quarter of the 7th century, the {{quayside}} settlement at Gipeswic (Ipswich) became an important estuarine trading centre, receiving imported goods such as pottery from other trading markets situated around the coasts of the North Sea. Steven Plunkett suggests that the founding of Gipeswic took place under Wuffingas supervision. It took another hundred years for the settlement <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> a town, but its beginnings can be seen as a reflection of the personal importance of Rædwald during the period of his supremacy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, Menage {{had begun to}} {{purchase}} land near Puget Sound in Washington, accumulating several thousand acres which he planned <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> an iron mine, smelter and steel mill, along with housing for the workers. To finance the development he sold an early form of mortgage-backed security to investors in New England and Europe. When the Panic of 1893 occurred, investors found that Menage's properties were fraudulent. Many of the deeds were held by random names taken from the Minneapolis and Saint Paul telephone books, the properties themselves were unimproved, and the payments to investors were being made out of the bank's funds.|$|E

5|$|Increased wartime {{manufacturing}} and industrial growth {{ushered in a}} new era of economic prosperity and the rise of labor unions in the city. By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center. New industries in Indianapolis included pork-packing plants and foundries, as well as numerous manufacturers, small businesses, retail shops, and banks. In 1876 Colonel Eli Lilly opened a new pharmaceutical laboratory on Indianapolis's Pearl Street, founding what later became Eli Lilly and Company. The Union Railroad Transfer and Stock Yards Company, another major employer, opened in 1877. After the war, Indianapolis continued <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> a transportation hub. Existing railroad lines expanded and new ones were established, linking Indianapolis to other cities across the nation.|$|E

5|$|Smuts's {{engagement}} with politics {{was very much}} a product of his time at Stellenbosch. While his parent's political moderation and rejection of Afrikaner exclusivism had left him largely unencumbered by any innate prejudices, it was his time at Victoria College which saw him develop his own independent political outlook. These views developed in tandem with another of Smuts's fixations, his philosophical pursuit of the embodiment of unity. This intellectual quest was later <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> his philosophy of Holism, but even at this early undeveloped stage he brought these ideas to bear in shaping his political opinions. So it was that Smuts emerged as an outspoken supporter of South African unity, and, by extension, a supporter of Rhodes.|$|E

5|$|The {{meteorological}} {{history of}} Hurricane Ivan, the longest tracked tropical cyclone of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, lasted from late August through late September. The hurricane developed from a tropical wave that moved {{off the coast}} of Africa on August 31. Tracking westward due to a ridge, favorable conditions allowed it <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> Tropical Depression Nine on September 2 in the deep tropical Atlantic Ocean. The cyclone gradually intensified until September 5, when it underwent rapid deepening and reached Category4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale; at the time Ivan was the southernmost major North Atlantic hurricane on record.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Emma {{originated}} {{from an area}} of low pressure that formed to the southeast of Java on 22 February 2006. Over the following few days, a monsoonal trough developed over the Timor Sea, leading to an increased likelihood of tropical cyclone formation from the initial low within several days. On 25 February, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology began monitoring the system as a tropical low. The low tracked slowly towards the south throughout the day and the centre of circulation relocated farther south late on 26 February. By this time, the Bureau of Meteorology anticipated the low <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> a tropical cyclone and attain winds of 95km/h (60mph 10-minute sustained) before moving over land in Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} {{a tropical}} storm, Blanca had already developed an eye-feature, though it not expected <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> a hurricane. The storm maintained a general northwestward track throughout its existence {{due to a}} mid-level ridge well {{to the west of}} the circulation. Shortly after, a central dense overcast, a large area of deep convection, developed over the center of circulation and large banding features developed along the periphery of the cyclone. Late on July6, Blanca reached its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) and a barometric pressure of 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg). Although the storm had intensified, its overall structure had deteriorated, with cloud tops warming and convection shrinking.|$|E
