5|$|Amateur astronomers Caroline Moore and Lucas Bolyard {{attended}} the event. Both Moore and Bolyard had previously made noteworthy discoveries in astronomy. New York {{high school student}} Moore contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of Supernova 2008ha in 2008, becoming the youngest individual to identify a supernova.|$|E
5|$|Even {{when this}} inner planet, {{with a mass}} at least 78% times that of Jupiter was {{accounted}} for, the star still showed a drift in its radial velocity. This eventually led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of the outer planet 55 Cancri d in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, the {{oil shale}} {{industry}} declined due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of large supplies of easily accessible and cheaper crude oil. Oil shale production however, continued to grow in Estonia, Russia and China.|$|E

5|$|Historically, the {{terrestrial}} locomotion of Pteranodon, especially {{whether it was}} bipedal or quadrupedal, {{has been the subject}} of debate. Today, most pterosaur researchers agree that pterosaurs were quadrupedal, thanks largely <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of pterosaur trackways.|$|E
5|$|In his {{biography}} of Christopher Columbus, Irving introduced the erroneous idea that Europeans believed {{the world to}} be flat prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of the New World. Borrowed from Irving, the flat-Earth myth has been taught in schools as fact to many generations of Americans.|$|E

5|$|Switzerland: M.alcathoe {{has been}} {{recorded}} from the Col du Marchairuz in the Jura Mountains (canton of Vaud).

5|$|A {{murder by}} cyanide was sensational news in Washington.

5|$|A {{nest box}} {{can also be}} {{regarded}} as an animal surveillance device. Surveilling animals can lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of new scientific and industrial fields. For example, biologists and engineers can work on barn owl surveillance techniques and devices, while social scientists document the practices that cause humans to observe an animal. While the diet of the barn owl has been studied, other areas like breeding success are not well known. Nest boxes provide direct physical access to the breeding location.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{earliest}} historical records of Copenhagen {{are from the}} end of the 12th century, recent archaeological finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's Kongens Nytorv from c. 1020. Excavations in Pilestræde have also led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where Strøget meets Rådhuspladsen.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} were undertaken from 1859 to 1874 by William Boyd Dawkins, {{who moved}} to Somerset to study classics with the vicar of Wookey. On hearing {{of the discovery of}} bones by local workmen he led excavations {{in the area of the}} hyena den. His work led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of the first evidence for the use by Palaeolithic man in the Caves of the Mendip Hills. Middle Paleolithic tools have been found in association with butchered bones with a radiocarbon age of around 41,000 years.|$|E

5|$|Beginning with William Stanley Jevons and Clément Juglar in the 1860s, economists {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} cycles of frequent, violent shifts in economic activity. A key milestone in this endeavor was {{the foundation of the}} U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research by Wesley Mitchell in 1920. This marked the beginning of a boom in atheoretical, statistical models of economic fluctuation (models based on cycles and trends instead of economic theory) that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of apparently regular economic patterns like the Kuznets wave.|$|E
5|$|Between 1964 and 1976, 50 {{killer whales}} from the Pacific Northwest were {{captured}} for display in aquaria, and {{public interest in}} the animals grew. In the 1970s, research pioneered by Michael Bigg led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of the species' complex social structure, its use of vocal communication, and its extraordinarily stable mother–offspring bonds. Through photo-identification techniques, individuals were named and tracked over decades.|$|E
5|$|Early {{drafts of}} Barret's {{background}} featured subtle differences, such as Marlene intended as Barret's biological daughter, {{and his wife}} executed {{in front of him}} by a then-undecided Shinra executive. The attack on Corel was initially written to be due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of Mako energy and Shinra's desire to keep its existence a secret. His reunion with Dyne was also different, written to culminate in a duel between the two in Corel's ruins, while Cloud and the others fought investigating Shinra soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Eighteenth century {{scientific}} laboratories usually contained {{some form}} of hand-operated electrostatic machine. Italian scientist Luigi Galvani had an electrostatic generator in his laboratory, where experiments with frog legs led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of animal electricity. Another Italian scientist, Alessandro Volta, disagreed with some of Galvani's ideas, and this scientific argument motivated Volta to develop the first frog-free galvanic cell, and led directly to {{the invention of the}} first practical electric battery, the voltaic pile.|$|E
5|$|In 1855, two English scientists, Joseph Dalton Hooker and Edward William Binney, {{made the}} first {{scientific}} description of coal balls in England, and the initial research on coal balls {{was carried out in}} Europe. North American coal balls were discovered and identified in 1922. Coal balls have since been found in other countries, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of hundreds of species and genera.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Compton {{was awarded}} {{one of the}} first two National Research Council Fellowships that allowed {{students}} to study abroad. He chose to go to Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory in England, where he studied the scattering and absorption of gamma rays. Further research along these lines led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of the Compton effect. He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism, concluding that it was a result of the alignment of electron spins, and studied cosmic rays, discovering that they were made up principally of positively charged particles.|$|E
