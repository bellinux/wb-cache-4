5|$|The pseudoarboricity of a graph G {{is defined}} by analogy to the arboricity as <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> number of pseudoforests into which its edges can be partitioned; equivalently, it is <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> k such that G is (k,0)-sparse, or <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> k such that the edges of G can be {{oriented}} to form a directed graph with outdegree at most k.

5|$|If all edge weights of an {{undirected graph}} are positive, then the minimax {{distances}} between pairs of points (the maximum edge weights of minimax paths) form an ultrametric; conversely every finite ultrametric space comes from minimax distances in this way. A data structure constructed from <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> spanning tree allows the minimax distance between any pair of vertices to be queried in constant time per query, using lowest common ancestor queries in a Cartesian tree. The {{root of the}} Cartesian tree represents the heaviest minimum spanning tree edge, {{and the children of}} the root are Cartesian trees recursively constructed from the subtrees of <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> spanning tree formed by removing the heaviest edge. The leaves of the Cartesian tree represent the vertices of the input graph, and the minimax distance between two vertices equals the weight of the Cartesian tree node that is their lowest common ancestor.
