25|$|In 1973, the Army {{began its}} {{withdrawal}} from Camp Edwards. Otis Air Force Base was also closed this year. In 1975, Otis reopened as Otis Air National Guard Base and all operations {{on the land}} occupied by Otis and Camp Edwards came {{under the control of}} the new Massachusetts Military Reservation. In 1978, the Air Force returned with the Perimeter Acquisition Vehicle Entry Phased Array Warning System, more popularly known as PAVE PAWS. This new facility was known as Cape Cod Air Force Station. In 1986, an artilleryman from the Connecticut Army National Guard overloaded a gun and the shell overshot the target by over a mile, hitting U.S. Route 6. No one was injured in the incident, although a two foot wide crater <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> inches deep occurred.|$|E

It could accommodate ten large torpedo bombers with folding wings; two smaller aircraft with folding wings could be stowed in lieu of each torpedo bomber. Two additional large aircraft and four smaller aircraft could be carried dismantled in crates in a hold below the hangar.|$|E
500|$|Anthropy told Harvey {{that she}} {{preferred}} characters with more realistic proportions; as a result, {{he ended up}} with a design <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> and a half heads tall. Due to her submissive position, he designed her to be an [...] "innocent" [...] who looked [...] "eager-to-please", with [...] "benign, wide eyed facial expressions". The evolution of her design resulted in Harvey having to redesign her appearance on the title screen. He employed different colors to demonstrate Jill's feelings for the Queen; he used a rose tint to demonstrate her [...] "blissful display of affection" [...] while using a grey wash to demonstrate her sadness. Harvey intended to add some red to her rubber body suit order to make her stand out from the background; however, he felt that this made the suit look more like a [...] "crazy wrestler costume". He later thought to include grey in the design or to put her initials on her chest, but decided on using an all black design. One of the difficulties of designing the suit was to make it look shiny without resembling [...] "gross lolicon manga porn".|$|E

2500|$|In April 2010, {{following}} a marked increase in Irish 2-year bond yields, Ireland's NTMA state debt agency {{said that it}} had [...] "no major refinancing obligations" [...] in 2010. Its requirement for [...] in 2010 was matched by a [...] cash balance, and it remarked: [...] "We're very comfortably circumstanced". On 18 May the NTMA tested the market and sold a €1.5billion issue <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> times oversubscribed. By September 2010 the banks could not raise finance and the bank guarantee was renewed for a third year. This had {{a negative impact on}} Irish government bonds, government help for the banks rose to 32% of GDP, and so the government started negotiations with the ECB and the IMF.|$|E
2500|$|In 1806, Gaeta had a {{population}} of about 8,000 and possessed powerful fortifications. The city stood on a peninsula that jutted into the sea. Gaeta's landward approaches were defended by a [...] long fortified trace <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> lines deep in places. The Breach Battery was [...] above the sea, the Queen's Battery even higher, while the Tower of Orlando stood [...] high. These works could concentrate a large volume of fire against any attacker. Gaeta's garrison under Hesse counted 3,750 foot soldiers disposed in the following regiments, 3rd Battalion of the Presidio (990), 3rd Battalion of the Carolina (850), Prince (600), Val di Mazzara (600), Apulia Chasseurs (110), Val Demone (100), and Val Dinotto (100). There were also 400 volunteers in the garrison. The garrison also included 2,000 irregulars. Many of the regulars were poor material, the scrapings of Neapolitan and Sicilian jails.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{generation}} Rambler American was achieved through a heavy restyling {{of the previous}} year's model under AMC's styling Vice President Edmund E. Anderson. While mechanically identical to the 1960 model, Anderson's restyle resulted in a car <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> inches (76mm) narrower and shorter in its exterior dimensions with an overall length of , but increased in its cargo capacity. Continuing to ride on the [...] wheelbase, the American's new styling was more square (sometimes described as [...] "breadbox") instead of the round [...] "roly-poly" [...] shape (or [...] "bathtub"), and the visual connection with the original 1950 Nash model had finally disappeared. Popular Mechanics wrote [...] "seldom has a car been completely restyled as the 1961 Rambler American and yet retain the same engine, driveline, suspension on the same unit body". All outside sheet metal was changed, but the side window frames remained the same as previous models. Only the back glass changed {{to conform to the}} new roof line. The firewall and dash board were new stampings, with the clutch and brake pedals moved from under the floor to the firewall.|$|E
