40|$|The {{objective}} of <b>the</b> <b>co-authors</b> is {{to study the}} motivation of purchasers of construction/finishing materials and the criteria that govern their selection. No systemic studies of consumer behavioral models and stereotypes in respect of residential housing have been performed so far. However, the environmentally determined management techniques, applicable {{to the production of}} building materials and construction of residential housing, are highly relevant both worldwide and in the Russian Federation. <b>The</b> <b>co-authors</b> have developed an original research methodology, drafted a questionnaire, and conducted a pilot survey. Its findings have proven that the price and quality of construction materials are the main factors that influence the decision making process in favor of particular items. Mere 14 % of the respondents chose environmental friendliness as the decision making criterion. The findings of the focus group projects have also proven the trustworthiness of the stereotypes and behavioral models identified by <b>the</b> <b>co-authors.</b> <b>The</b> <b>co-authors</b> make a conclusion that further sociological surveys are needed to implement the patterns of environmentally determined management and to influence the value paradigms of the population...|$|R
