25|$|Not once, {{but three}} times, the stumps were plucked by players eager to grab souvenirs of an {{historic}} occasion. First of all, the Australian captain bowled a full toss down the leg side and <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that Compton would {{hit the ball}} to the boundary rails. He forgot that Compton was out of form and out of luck. Instead of the ball going to the rails, it was missed completely and poor Tallon, with his arms full of stumps and bails, had to drop the lot and take the ball.|$|E

Khrushchev backed down from a confrontation, and the Soviet Union removed the missiles in return for an American pledge not to invade Cuba again. Castro later admitted that [...] "I would have agreed {{to the use of}} nuclear weapons. ... we <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that it would become a nuclear war anyway, and {{that we were going to}} disappear." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} some {{historical}} controversy over whether Albert Einstein {{was aware of the}} Michelson–Morley results when he developed his theory of special relativity, which pronounced the aether to be [...] "superfluous." [...] In a later interview, Einstein said of the Michelson–Morley experiment, [...] "I was not conscious it had influenced me directly... I guess I just <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that it was true." [...] Regardless of Einstein's specific knowledge, the experiment is today considered the canonical experiment in regards to showing the lack of a detectable aether.|$|E

2500|$|Following Kant, some {{philosophers}} {{have considered}} the relationship between aprioricity, analyticity, and necessity to be extremely close. According to Jerry Fodor, [...] "Positivism, in particular, <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that a priori truths must be necessary...." [...] However, since Kant, the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions had slightly changed. Analytic propositions were largely taken to be [...] "true by virtue of meanings and independently of fact", while synthetic propositions were not—one must conduct some sort of empirical investigation, looking to the world, to determine the truth-value of synthetic propositions.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 March 2008 in New York, Matthew Nimetz {{announced}} that the talks had failed, {{that there was a}} [...] "gap" [...] in the positions of the two countries, and that there would not be any progress, unless there were some sort of compromise, which he characterised as [...] "valuable" [...] for both sides. After Greek PM Karamanlis's warnings that [...] "no solution equals no invitation", the Greek media <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that Greece would veto the coming NATO accession talks for the country, in the Foreign Ministers' summit on 6 March 2008 in Brussels.|$|E

[...] The oath sparked an unprecedented dynastic crisis: two principal contenders forfeited their rights in favor of each other in [...] "a hitherto unheard-of struggle — a struggle not for the acquisition of power, but for its renunciation!". The throne remained vacant.|$|E

2500|$|Jesuit author Felix Just {{also finds}} {{similarities}} between many other Greco-Roman moral writings {{and four of}} the later New Testament epistles (letters). The biblical Household Codes contain instructions for particular groups of people within Christian families or [...] "Households" [...] {{as to how they}} should treat other members of their Household. He writes that most people in the first-century Roman Empire <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that a pater familias had absolute authority and control over his Household. Thus, the secular examples of such [...] "Household Codes" [...] usually just indicated how slaves, children, or wives should act toward their masters, fathers, or husbands, respectively. They quite rarely also tell the adult men how they should treat the slaves, children, or wives who are members of their household.|$|E
2500|$|This rapidly democratizing society, as Tocqueville {{understood}} it, had {{a population}} devoted to [...] "middling" [...] values which wanted to amass, through hard work, vast fortunes. In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why America {{was so different}} from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth, while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar, and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money; many were virtually guaranteed wealth and <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted.</b> At {{the same time in}} America, workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries.|$|E
2500|$|Heaney's work is used {{extensively}} on school syllabuses internationally, including the anthologies The Rattle Bag (1982) and The School Bag (1997) (both edited with Ted Hughes). Originally entitled The Faber Book of Verse for Younger People on the Faber contract, Hughes and Heaney decided {{the main purpose}} of The Rattle Bag was to offer enjoyment to the reader: [...] "Arbitrary riches." [...] Heaney commented [...] "the book in our heads was something closer to The Fancy Free Poetry Supplement." [...] It included work that they would have liked to encountered sooner in their own lives, as well as nonsense rhymes, ballad-type poems, riddles, folk songs and rhythmical jingles. Much familiar canonical work was not included, since they <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that their audience would know the standard fare. Fifteen years later, The School Bag aimed at something different. The foreword stated that they wanted [...] "less of a carnival, more like a checklist." [...] It included poems in English, Irish, Welsh, Scots and Scots Gaelic, together with work reflecting the African-American experience.|$|E

2500|$|Gorbachev's {{election}} to the General Secretaryship was the quickest in Soviet history. The Politburo recommended Gorbachev to the Central Committee, and the Central Committee approved him. The Politburo meeting, which elected Gorbachev to the General Secretaryship, did not include such members as Dinmukhamed Konayev, Volodymyr Shcherbytsky and Vitaly Vorotnikov. Of these three, Konayev and Shcherbytsky were Brezhnevites, and Vorotnikov, while not supporting Gorbachev, <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> that Gorbachev would succeed Chernenko. It is conceivable, according to historian Archie Brown, that Konayev and Shcherbytsky would rather have voted in favour of Viktor Grishin as General Secretary, than Gorbachev. At the same meeting, Grishin was asked to chair the commission responsible for Chernenko's funeral; Grishin turned down the offer, claiming that Gorbachev was closer to Chernenko than he was. By doing this, he practically signaled his support for Gorbachev's ascension to the General Secretaryship. Andrei Gromyko, the longtime foreign minister, proposed Gorbachev {{as a candidate for}} the General Secretaryship. The Politburo and the Central Committee elected Gorbachev as General Secretary unanimously. Ryzhkov, in retrospect, claimed that the Soviet system had [...] "created, nursed and formed" [...] Gorbachev, but that [...] "long ago Gorbachev had internally rebelled against the native System." [...] In the same vein, Gorbachev's adviser Andrey Grachev, noted that he was a [...] "genetic error of the system." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the Meiji {{government}} {{endeavored to}} assimilate Western ideas, {{technological advances and}} ways of warfare. By the late 19th century, Japan had transformed itself into a modernized industrial state. The Japanese wanted {{to be recognized as}} equal with the Western powers. The Meiji restoration had always been intended to make Japan a modernized state, not a Westernized one, and Japan was always an imperialist power, looking towards overseas expansionism. In the years 1869–73, the Seikanron ("Conquer Korea Argument") had bitterly divided the Japanese elite between one faction that wanted to conquer Korea immediately vs. another that wanted to wait until Japan was more modernized before embarking on a war to conquer Korea; significantly no-one in the Japanese elite ever accepted the idea that the Koreans had the right to be independent, with only the question of timing dividing the two factions. In {{much the same way that}} Europeans used the backwardness of Africa and Asia as a reason for why they had to conquer nations of Africa and Asia, for the Japanese elite the backwardness of China and Korea was proof of the inferiority of those nations, thus giving the Japanese the [...] "right" [...] to conquer them. Inouye Kaoru, the Foreign Minister gave a speech in 1887 saying [...] "What we must do is to transform our empire and our people, make the empire like the countries of Europe and our people like the peoples of Europe", going to say that the Chinese and Koreans had essentially forfeited their right to be independent by not modernizing. Much of the pressure for an aggressive foreign policy in Japan came from below, with the advocates of [...] "people's rights" [...] movement calling for an elected parliament also favoring an ultra-nationalist line that <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> the Japanese had the [...] "right" [...] to annex Korea, as the [...] "people's right" [...] movement was led by those who favored invading Korea in the years 1869–73. As part of the modernization process in Japan, Social Darwinian ideas about the [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] were common in Japan from the 1880s onward and many ordinary Japanese resented the heavy taxes imposed by the government to modernize Japan, demanding something tangible like an overseas colony as a reward for their sacrifices. Furthermore, the educational system of Meiji Japan was meant to train the schoolboys to be soldiers when they grew up, and as such, Japanese schools indoctrinated their students into Bushido ("the spirit of the warriors"), the fierce code of the samurai. Having indoctrinated the younger generations into Bushido, the Meiji elite found themselves faced with a people who clamored for war, and regarded diplomacy as a weakness. The British Japanologist Richard Storry wrote the biggest misconception about Japan in the West was that the Japanese people were the [...] "docile" [...] instruments of the elite, when in fact much of the pressure for Japan's wars from 1894 to 1941 came from below, as ordinary people demanded a [...] "tough" [...] foreign policy, and tended to engage in riots and assassination when foreign policy was perceived to be pusillanimous. Though the Meiji oligarchy refused to allow democracy, they did seek to appropriate some of the demands of the [...] "people's rights" [...] movement by allowing an elected Diet in 1890 (with limited powers and an equally limited franchise) and by pursuing an aggressive foreign policy towards Korea.|$|E
