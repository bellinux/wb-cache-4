6000|$|Burgess {{was glad}} {{the thing was}} settled. The temptation to allow {{sentiment}} to interfere with business might have become too strong if he had waited much longer. He {{knew that it would}} be a wrench definitely excluding Bob from the team, and he hated <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> The more he thought of it, the sorrier he was for him. If he could have pleased himself, he would have kept Bob In. But, as the poet has it, [...] "Pleasure is pleasure, and biz is biz, and kep' in a sepyrit jug."

6000|$|The Eugenists get {{the ear of}} {{the humane}} but rather hazy cliques {{by saying that the}} present [...] "conditions" [...] under which people work and breed are bad for the race; but the modern mind will not {{generally}} stretch beyond one step of reasoning, and the consequence which appears to follow on the consideration of these [...] "conditions" [...] is by no means what would originally have been expected. If somebody says: [...] "A rickety cradle may mean a rickety baby," [...] the natural deduction, one would think, would be to give the people a good cradle, or give them money enough to buy one. But that means higher wages and greater equalisation of wealth; and the plutocratic scientist, with a slightly troubled expression, turns his eyes and pince-nez in another direction. Reduced to brutal terms of truth, his difficulty is this and simply this: More food, leisure, and money for the workman would mean a better workman, better even {{from the point of view}} of anyone for whom he worked. But more food, leisure, and money would also mean a more independent workman. A house with a decent fire and a full pantry would be a better house to make a chair or mend a clock in, even from the customer's point of view, than a hovel with a leaky roof and a cold hearth. But a house with a decent fire and a full pantry would also be a better house in which to refuse to make a chair or mend a clock--a much better house to do nothing in--and doing nothing is sometimes one of the highest of the duties of man. All but the hard-hearted must be torn with pity for this pathetic dilemma of the rich man, who has to keep the poor man just stout enough to do the work and just thin enough <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> As he stood gazing at the leaky roof and the rickety cradle in a pensive manner, there one day came into his mind a new and curious idea--one of the most strange, simple, and horrible ideas that have ever risen from the deep pit of original sin.|$|E

Numerical experiments on a network of workstations and a parallel computer are included. ...|$|R

New owners Citadel Broadcasting, which had bought ABC Radio from Disney in 2008, chose Mike Huckabee, instead, but the show lasted only one week before being taken off the air. Gross was {{actually}} happy not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the show as that would have had him going into KGO San Francisco at around 1:00a.m. to prep for the show that morning for the East Coast broadcasts (and his talk show was not until the late afternoon).|$|R
6000|$|Withal the joyful tranquillity of {{this man}} is notable. I will not blame Dante for his misery: it is as battle without victory; but true battle,--the first, {{indispensable}} thing. Yet I call Shakspeare greater than Dante, in that he fought truly, and did conquer. Doubt it not, {{he had his own}} sorrows: those Sonnets of his will even testify expressly in what deep waters he had waded, and swum struggling for his life;--as what man like him ever failed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> <b>It</b> seems to me a heedless notion, our common one, that he sat like a bird on the bough; and sang forth, free and off-hand, never knowing the troubles of other men. Not so; with no man is it so. How could a man travel forward from rustic deer-poaching to such tragedy-writing, and not fall in with sorrows by the way? Or, still better, how could a man delineate a Hamlet, a Coriolanus, a Macbeth, so many suffering heroic hearts, if his own heroic heart had never suffered?--And now, in contrast with all this, observe his mirthfulness, his genuine overflowing love of laughter! You would say, in no point does he exaggerate but only in laughter. Fiery objurgations, words that pierce and burn, {{are to be found in}} Shakspeare; yet he is always in measure here; never what Johnson would remark as a specially [...] "good hater." [...] But his laughter seems to pour from him in floods; he heaps all manner of ridiculous nicknames on the butt he is bantering, tumbles and tosses him in all sorts of horse-play; you would say, with his whole heart laughs. And then, if not always the finest, it is always a genial laughter. Not at mere weakness, at misery or poverty; never. No man who can laugh, what we call laughing, will laugh at these things. It is some poor character only desiring to laugh, and have the credit of wit, that does so. Laughter means sympathy; good laughter is not [...] "the crackling of thorns under the pot." [...] Even at stupidity and pretension this Shakspeare does not laugh otherwise than genially. Dogberry and Verges tickle our very hearts; and we dismiss them covered with explosions of laughter: but we like the poor fellows only the better for our laughing; and hope they will get on well there, and continue Presidents of the City-watch. Such laughter, like sunshine on the deep sea, is very beautiful to me.|$|E
6000|$|There {{are some}} whom I love too tenderly {{to be easy}} under their displeasure, or even under their injustice. Only it, {{seems to me that}} with time and {{patience}} my poor dearest papa will be melted into opening his arms to us--will be melted into a clearer understanding of motives and intentions; I cannot believe that he will forget me, as he says he will, and go on thinking me to be dead rather than alive and happy. So I manage to hope for the best, and all that remains, all my life here, is best already, could not be better or happier. And willingly tell dear Mr. Martin I would take him and you for witnesses of it, and in the meanwhile he is not to send me tantalising messages; no, indeed, unless you really, really, should let yourselves be wafted our way, and could you do so much better at Pau? particularly if Fanny Hanford should come here. Will she really? The climate is described by the inhabitants as a 'pleasant spring throughout the winter,' and if you were to see Robert and me threading our path along the shady side everywhere to avoid the 'excessive heat of the sun' in this November (!) it would appear a good beginning. We are not in the warm orthodox position by the Arno because we heard with our ears one of the best physicians of the place advise against it. 'Better,' he said, 'to have cool rooms to live in and warm walks to go out along.' The rooms we have are rather over-cool perhaps; we are obliged to have a little fire in the sitting-room, in the mornings and evenings that is; but I do not fear for the winter, there is too much difference to my feelings between this November and any English November I ever knew. We have our dinner from the Trattoria at two o'clock, and can dine our favorite way on thrushes and chianti with a miraculous cheapness, and no trouble, no cook, no kitchen; the prophet Elijah or the lilies of the field took as little thought for their dining, which exactly suits us. It is a continental fashion which we never cease commending. Then at six we have coffee, and rolls of milk, made of milk, I mean, and at nine our supper (call it supper, if you please) of roast chestnuts and grapes. So you see how primitive we are, and how I forget to praise the eggs at breakfast. The worst of Pisa is, or would be to some persons, that, socially speaking, it has its dullnesses; it is not lively like Florence, not in that way. But we do not want society, we shun it rather. We like the Duomo and the Campo Santo instead. Then we know a little of Professor Ferucci, who gives us access to the University library, and we subscribe to a modern one, and we have plenty of writing to do of our own. If we can do anything for Fanny Hanford, let us know. It would be too happy, I suppose, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for yourselves. Think, however, I am quite well, quite well. I can thank God, too, for being alive and well. Make dear Mr. Martin keep well, and not forget himself in the Herefordshire cold--draw him into the sun somewhere. Now write and tell me everything of your plans and of you both, dearest friends. My husband bids me say that he desires to have my friends for his own friends, and that he is grateful to you for not crossing that feeling. Let him send his regards to you. And let me be throughout all changes, ...|$|E
