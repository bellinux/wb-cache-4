60|$|He {{broke off}} his sentence. Macheson, too, had <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> listen.|$|E
60|$|Young Mont <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> where Fleur was {{standing}} in the window.|$|E
60|$|She {{leaned forward}} and looked at him. Unwillingly he <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> meet her gaze.|$|E
60|$|So after {{a little}} while Sir Tristram left that place, without <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> see if any man {{followed}} him.|$|R
60|$|Just now Horatio {{was playing}} ragtime with amazing rapidity, {{stamping}} <b>his</b> foot and <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> smirk at the others.|$|R
50|$|Nicholas was a {{professional}} footballer at various clubs such as Doncaster Rovers, St Mirren, Arbroath, Millwall before <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> acting.|$|R
60|$|Dominey ceased {{swinging}} his putter carelessly {{over the head}} of a daisy and <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> listen.|$|E
6000|$|The Mule <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> look reproachfully {{at his old}} friend, {{the young}} girl. [...] "Who can fight against magic?" [...] he asked.|$|E
60|$|He <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> look at her. She was {{so close}} to him that their hats collided. He was profuse in his apologies.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{that is how}} it is done," [...] thought Leonard <b>to</b> himself, <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> {{watch the}} process, no detail of which escaped him.|$|R
6000|$|Tip {{was bound}} so tightly by the cord {{that he could}} not <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> look at <b>his</b> companions; so he said to the Saw-Horse: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perfectly," [...] {{declared}} Jack, {{reaching up}} <b>his</b> arms <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the front, the pumpkin having twisted around upon the stick that supported it.|$|R
6000|$|Poker sprang forward, wagging {{the stump}} of his tail, and <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> one side, {{as if to}} say: [...] "Well, what's up? Any fun going?" ...|$|E
60|$|She broke off. An {{unfamiliar}} {{quality in}} her voice struck into him. He <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> see her face, {{rose to his feet}} staring at her.|$|E
6000|$|Sir Richmond <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> Dr. Martineau. His face {{puckered}} like a peevish child's. [...] "They'd {{want things}} said to them...Things to remember...I CAN'T. I'm tired out." ...|$|E
60|$|Christian {{started and}} grew paler, {{but did not}} <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> see who had spoken. The {{midshipman}} at his side had evidently not heard the whisper.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Timorous?' said Mr Flintwinch, <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> retort, as he {{went before}} with the candle. 'More courageous than ninety men in a hundred, sir, let me tell you.' ...|$|R
60|$|Voices {{attracted}} <b>his</b> attention, and, <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> {{the other}} side, {{he saw a}} big Indian pacing near him, and beyond, seven savages and three white men reclining in the shade.|$|R
60|$|Corley <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> see who {{had called}} him, and then {{continued}} walking as before. Lenehan ran after him, settling the waterproof on his shoulders with one hand.|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> {{glance over}} the fields. 'Yes, it is, very,' he replied. There was the faintest accent, a little drawl of unfriendliness in the remark.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the dying}} man <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> Galeotto. [...] "You will see justice done upon that monster ere you die," [...] he said. [...] "It is God's holy work." ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: One of {{the oldest}} known representations: Perseus, wearing the talaria and {{carrying}} the kibisis over <b>his</b> shoulder, <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> kill Medusa on this Orientalizing relief pithos, c. 660 BCE, Louvre museum.|$|R
60|$|Bilbil {{was deeply}} vexed {{and would not}} even <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> look at <b>his</b> master. To escape from Rinkitink he wandered among {{the ruins of the}} palace, where he came upon Prince Inga.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{representation of}} the Madonna and Child may be the wall painting in the Catacomb of Priscilla, Rome, in which the seated Madonna suckles the Child, who <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> gaze at the spectator.|$|R
6000|$|He got up slowly. His beard, unclipped since Teresa's death, thick, snow-white, {{covered his}} {{powerful}} chest. He <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the door, {{and called out}} in his strong voice-- ...|$|E
60|$|All the caress in {{his eyes}} for the books {{vanished}} as he <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> look at me, and ere he spoke I knew that I, too, was hated.|$|E
60|$|Very {{slowly and}} with obvious effort Lionel <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the right, and his dull eyes went beyond Sir John and made quest {{in the ranks}} of those that stood about him.|$|E
6000|$|Bartley did {{not even}} <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> look round at him. [...] "Keep your money!" [...] he said, as he plunged forward through the snow. [...] "I wouldn't touch a cent of it to save your life." ...|$|R
50|$|Finally, Detective Hadley {{hands the}} train {{schedule}} {{to the new}} butcher, who wears a ring with {{the symbol of the}} group that feeds the creatures. The killer walks onto the midnight train and <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> reveal himself as Leon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quit your kiddin'," [...] Billy laughed back, <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> {{look into}} Saxon's eyes. [...] "Don't listen to 'em. They're grouched {{because they got}} to dance together. Bert's a rotten dancer, and Mary ain't so much. Come on, there she goes. See you after two more dances." ...|$|R
60|$|She laughed very softly--a dear, {{familiar}} sound {{it was to}} him. He <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> {{watch the}} curve of the lips that he loved, the faint contraction of her eyebrows as the smile spread.|$|E
6000|$|Captain Carton had, in {{the boat}} by him, a curious long-barrelled Spanish gun, and he had said to Miss Maryon one day {{that it was the}} best of guns, and had <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> me, and said: ...|$|E
60|$|But the pup {{was hardly}} {{prepared}} {{for such a}} complete and sudden concession as the invitation implied. He repeated the tremor, however, and <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the other side, {{by way of a}} change, but sat still.|$|E
60|$|Then with a jerk of his {{funny little}} tail he was gone. It {{seemed as if}} the earth must have {{swallowed}} him up. Striped Chipmunk can move very quickly, and he had whisked out of sight in the bushes before Peter Rabbit could <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> watch him.|$|R
50|$|He {{was known}} as the Bola Raja, or the 'Deaf King', not only about his {{inability}} to understand things mentioned to the right side of him, due to a congenital defect, but also due to <b>his</b> attitude of <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> ignore any viewpoints that were contrary to his own.|$|R
6000|$|... "What need of talk?" [...] said Baloo slowly, <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> where Mowgli lay. [...] "Akela by {{the river}} said it, that Mowgli should drive Mowgli back to the Man-Pack. I said it. But who listens now to Baloo? Bagheera--where is Bagheera this night?--he knows also. It is the Law." ...|$|R
