5|$|Marasmius sasicola {{was first}} {{described}} by Haruki Takahashi (2002) {{in an article}} in Mycoscience, based on specimens collected from Ikuta Ryokuchi Park, Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan in 2000 and 2001. The specific name sasicola refers to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> species grows upon the leaves of Sasa species. The Japanese common name for the species is Sasa-no-houraitake. Within the genus Mycena, it probably belongs to the section Marasmius, and the subsection Penicillati, due to characters of the stem, gills and pileipellis (the outer-most layer of the cap).|$|E
5|$|On January 28, 1905, {{an article}} {{ran in the}} Indianapolis News {{containing}} information {{on the origin of}} the seal, some of it dubious. The article received much attention and started an informal inquiry into the history of the seal, and namely to discover if the sun in the seal was rising or setting. Jacob Piatt Dunn, the preeminent Indiana historian of the time, consulted several history and arrived at the conclusion that the sun was rising. Dunn cited <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> state was young, and the mountains were to the east of the state, not the west—clearly indicating the sun was rising.|$|E

5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{differs from}} species of Fomitiporia in two key respects. Its spores are less dextrinoid {{than those of}} the genus and their shape is atypical. Other than this, it is typical of the genus, {{according}} to the original description. Five species of Fomitiporia, F.bannaensis, F.pseudopunctata, F.sonorae, F.sublaevigata and F.tenuis, share with P.ellipsoideus the resupinate fruit bodies and the setae in the hymenium. Despite this, all of them but P.ellipsoideus have straight hymenial setae, and all of them have spores that are spherical or almost spherical, which is much more typical of the genus. F.uncinata (formerly Phellinus uncinatus) has hooked hymenial setae, and the spores are, as with P.ellipsoideus, thick-walled and dextrinoid. The species can be differentiated by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> spores are spherical or nearly so, and somewhat larger than those of P.ellipsoideus, measuring 5.5 to 7 by 5 to 6.5μm. The species is also known only from tropical America, where it grows on bamboo.|$|E
5|$|The Spartan {{council of}} Elders, the gerousia, {{suggested}} that the Spartan women be sent to Crete for their protection. They were dissuaded from doing so by Arachidamia, the former queen and grandmother of the Eurypontid King Eudamidas II who convinced them that the women could assist in the city's defence. In order to guarantee the fighting men some rest, the women and the elderly began bolstering defences. Aware that Pyrrhus had elephants with him, the defenders dug a large trench and sunk wagons into the ground at its flanks in order to hinder the Epiriote advance. Moreover, messengers were sent both to summon Areus back and to request aid from Antigonus, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> Sparta and Macedon had traditionally been hostile. Pausanias, the Greek geographer, claims that Sparta received some aid from Messene and the pro-Spartan faction at Argos.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} of this work, {{published}} in 1861, was received so favourably that the author has felt bound to bestow his utmost care upon a minute and thorough revision of his book, {{in the hope of}} bringing up the information it contains to the existing state of knowledge. In this endeavour he has been assisted as well by Canon Lightfoot, to whom he is indebted for that section of the third chapter which treats of Egyptian versions of the New Testament (pp. 319-357), as also by much unsought for and most welcome help, especially {{on the part of those}} scholars who are named in p. 164, note. Without wishing to speak harshly of writers who are not very scrupulous in such matters, he has always thought it became him to borrow from no quarter without making a full and frank avowal of <b>the</b> <b>fact.</b> <b>The</b> author will be much rejoiced if this new edition shall be judged not less worthy than its predecessor to become a text book in Universities and Theological Celleges.|$|E

5|$|The post-Taylor {{capacity}} of Highbury {{was limited to}} 38,419, while Arsenal's success during the 1990s and 2000s meant that virtually every home match was filled to near capacity.

In October 1998, just after Arsenal started playing Champions League games at Wembley, the club made an unsuccessful bid to buy the stadium and make it their permanent home to share with the England national football team, although at the time Wembley was two years away from closure for a redevelopment which was not completed until more than six years later.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{previous}} Indiana Jones films, Spielberg shot the entire {{film in the}} United States, stating {{he did not want}} to be away from his family. Shooting began on June 18, 2007, in Deming, New Mexico.

5|$|England {{made three}} further changes. Spinner Jack Young and paceman Dick Pollard {{replaced}} the spin pair of Doug Wright and Jim Laker in the bowling department, meaning England would only play one slow bowler. Wright and Laker had struggled {{to penetrate the}} Australian batting lineup in the Second Test, taking match figures of 2/123 and 2/128 respectively. In contrast, Pollard had taken match figures of 4/85 for Lancashire in a match against Australia earlier in the season, and had taken 27 wickets in four county matches in the past fortnight. The selection was seen as being influenced by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> Test was being staged at Lancashire's home ground, where Pollard {{was familiar with the}} conditions, and the Australians had a high regard for him. In the month since being dropped for the Second Test in favour of Wright, after taking 1/107 in the First Test, Young had returned to play for Middlesex, taking 27 wickets in five matches. Alec Coxon, the Yorkshire allrounder who made his Test debut in the previous match at Lord's and opened the bowling, taking match figures of 3/172 and scoring 19 and a duck, was replaced by Jack Crapp, a debutant batsman. Crapp had scored 100 not out and 32 for Gloucestershire in the preceding match against the tourists. It was only the third century scored against Australia during the tour, and was part of a season in which Crapp had made four centuries and six half-centuries in 16 matches thus far. Coxon's omission was believed to have been caused more by off-field events than sporting merit. There was a story that he punched Denis Comptonwhom he disliked and considered self-importantin the dressing room, but Coxon always denied this. However, there was certainly an altercation and Coxon was never selected again. O'Reilly interpreted the omission of the Yorkshiremen Hutton and Coxon {{at the expense of the}} Gloucestershire pair of Crapp and Emmett as symptoms of a regional bias in the English selection panel. He pointed out that only one of the four selectorsEngland captain Norman Yardley, who was also from Yorkshirewas from the north of the country.|$|E

5|$|Reflecting Holby City origins as a {{spin-off}} from Casualty and the {{closely related}} premises {{of the two}} programmes, the BBC has screened occasional crossover mini-dramas entitled Casualty@Holby City, featuring a number of characters {{from each of the}} two casts. Prior to the commissioning of Casualty@Holby City, the two shows had occasionally crossed-over storylines and cast members before; for instance developing a romance between Holby City Ben Saunders (David Paisley) and Casualty Tony Vincent (Lee Warburton). The first full crossover was spearheaded by Casualty executive producer Mervyn Watson, and Holby City McHale. Logistical difficulties arose from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> two series are usually produced 120 miles apart, and work on both shows had to be halted for two weeks to release a number of cast members to appear in the special. A second crossover was commissioned in 2005 as part of the BBC's DoNation season, aiming to raise public awareness of organ donation and help viewers make an informed decision about whether to sign up to the Organ Donor Register. An interactive episode of Casualty@Holby City was one of the headlining shows of the season, allowing viewers to vote by phone to determine the outcome of a fictional organ donation. The third Casualty@Holby City crossover aired in October 2005. The four-part storyline tackled the issue of youth violence, following the events of a turbulent A demonstration at an inner-city school. Based on the success of the 2004 Casualty@Holby City Christmas special, another crossover was ordered for Christmas 2005. Rather than dividing the episodes between the two series' crews as had previously been standard, this crossover operated as an entirely separate production, with Kyle producing and Paul Harrison directing.|$|E
5|$|The area most {{affected}} by the cyclone was in and around Trincomalee: 57people checked into the local hospital {{as a result of}} falling trees or debris, with one person killed due to a falling tree. An entire fishing village was completely destroyed, and heavy rainfall flooded rivers, lakes, and canals, covering roads and crops with floodwaters. The flooding destroyed about 77squaremiles (200km²) of rice fields, and an additional 19square miles (50km²) of other crops. Strong winds damaged or destroyed around 83,000houses across the country, including 2,000houses destroyed in Kinnia and 6,600 in Trincomalee. The passage of the cyclone left up to 500,000temporarily homeless on the island, most of whom fled to churches, schools, temples, and shopping centers. The winds blew off the roofs of several police stations and military camps, and flooded several refugee camps. The winds damaged electrical systems and disrupted about 3,000telephone systems, and many roads were left impassable. Large areas remained without power for several days. No damage reports exist for regions under control of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> storm made landfall there.

5|$|The {{extent of}} Domnall's {{rule in the}} kingdom is unknown, and it is {{questionable}} whether he had any real authority in the northern Hebrides, furthest from Mann. In about 1097, Magnús sent a delegate named Ingimundr into the Isles to take possession of the kingdom. After installing himself in Lewis, Ingimundr was overthrown and killed whilst attempting to usurp the kingship. Ingimundr's rationale for seating himself upon an island (Lewis and Harris) {{on the edge of}} the kingdom may have been due to the fact that he was unable to gain any authority on Mann itself. In fact, the chronicle reveals that civil war erupted there the following year, and the chronicler Orderic Vitalis (died c. 1142) indicates that Mann was devastated to point of being a virtual desert by the time Magnús appeared on the scene. The warring itself may have been related to the aforesaid factional struggles between Guðrøðr's sons. Although it is possible that it was Magnús who actually forced Domnall from the Isles, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> chronicle makes no mention of Domnall during the recorded conflict on Mann may be evidence that he had lost control of the island by then. Within the year, the same source records the arrival of Magnús himself, which could suggest that it was Ingimundr's slaying, at the hands of the Islesmen, that had incited Magnús to take matters into his own hands.|$|E
