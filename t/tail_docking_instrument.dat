40|$|Abstract Background Tail biting is {{a common}} and serious welfare problem in pig production, causing large {{economical}} losses. <b>Tail</b> <b>docking</b> is performed routinely in most EU countries to reduce the tail biting risk. However, <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> is painful, and does not prevent tail biting totally. The risk factors behind <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> are multifactorial and most analyses are based on studies using biological or epidemiological approaches. There is very little information available on how producers deal with tail biting on-farm. There are also no studies on the attitude of producers towards <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> and <b>tail</b> biting in systems with long-tailed pigs. We aimed to study how farmers rate the efficiency of different measures for preventing and intervening with tail biting, when <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> is not allowed. Furthermore, we investigated the attitudes of Finnish farmers to <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> and <b>tail</b> biting. Results Respondents scored feeding-related issues to be most important for prevention of tail biting, identifying and removing the biting pig as most important intervention measures, and straw {{as the most important}} manipulable material when preventing tail biting. Tail biting was not perceived as a very serious problem by over 70  % of the respondents, even though docking is not allowed, and was reported to occur close to a level which was also considered acceptable by the respondents. Most respondents did not think it is probable they would raise <b>tail</b> <b>docked</b> pigs if it were possible, but about 21  % probably would. Conclusions In comparison with other authors’ findings, the ranking of importance of risk factors for tail biting differs between scientists and farmers, and between farmers in different cultures of pig production. In addition, the attitude towards tail biting and <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> appears to be very different in producers with different experiences of <b>tail</b> <b>docking.</b> These results indicate that a scientist-farmer dialogue, as well as international communication is important when trying {{to reduce the risk of}} tail biting, and subsequently the need for <b>tail</b> <b>docking...</b>|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to understand factors that may influence responses to stress, as these factors may also influence vulnerability to pathologies that can develop when stress responses are excessive or prolonged. It is clear that, in adults, the sex of an individual can influence the cortisol response to stress in a stressor specific manner. Nevertheless, the stage of development at which these sex differences emerge is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that there are sex differences in the cortisol response to <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> and ACTH in lambs of 1 and 8 weeks of age. We also established cortisol responses in males when <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> was imposed alone and in combination with castration at these ages. In experiment 1, 1 and 8 week old male and female lambs were subjected to sham handling, <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> or, in males, a combination of <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> and castration. In experiment 2, we administered ACTH (1. 0 IU/kg) to male and female lambs at 1 and 8 weeks of age. There were significant cortisol responses to all treatments at both ages. Sex differences in the cortisol responses to <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> and ACTH developed between 1 and 8 weeks of age, with females having greater responses than males. The data suggest that the mechanism for the sex difference in response to <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> may involve the adrenal glands.

40|$|Tail biting is {{a common}} problem in modern pig {{production}} and has {{a negative impact on}} both animal welfare and economic result of the farm. Tail biting risk is increased by management and housing practices that fail to meet the basic needs of pigs. <b>Tail</b> <b>docking</b> is commonly used {{to reduce the risk of}} tail biting, but <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> in itself is a welfare problem, as it causes pain to the pigs, and facilitates suboptimal production methods from a welfare point-of-view. When evaluating the cost and benefit of <b>tail</b> <b>docking,</b> it is important to consider negative impacts of both <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> and <b>tail</b> biting.

40|$|<b>Tail</b> <b>docking</b> of pigs is {{performed}} routinely {{in many parts}} of the world to reduce the incidence of unwanted tail biting behaviour. Whilst tail biting can have serious welfare consequences for affected pigs, <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> may also negatively affect pig welfare as a result of acute pain induced by the procedure itself, as well as through long-term changes in afferent neural inputs from the remaining tail stump. The aims of this thesis were to examine the influences of docking method and piglet age on acute nociceptive responses to tail docking; to evaluate the efficacy of selected anti-nociceptive strategies in mitigating acute nociceptive responses to tail docking; to determine whether docking method affects subsequent neural morphology of the healed tail stump. The minimal anaesthesia model (MAM), which involves analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) data, was used to evaluate acute nociceptive responses and to ascertain the efficacy of anti-nociceptive strategies. Histopathological examination of tissue harvested from tail tips was performed to evaluate alterations in neural morphology that might be associated with long-term changes in pain processing. Comparison of the acute nociceptive responses of 2 - and 20 -day-old pigs to <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> revealed little evidence of nociception in the younger age group compared with a typical response in the older pigs. In addition, total EEG power was lower in 2 day-old pigs. These results suggest that there are differences in either neural maturity, and/or in nociceptive processing between the two ages. <b>Tail</b> <b>docking</b> using cautery iron appears to be less acutely painful to pigs than <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> using clippers. However, the longer-term pain consequences associated with the two methods need to be assessed before one method is recommended over the other. Prior application of a topical anaesthetic (EMLA) cream to the tail abolished EEG indicators of acute nociception in pigs <b>tail</b> <b>docked</b> using clippers, whereas prior administration of oral meloxicam had no effect on EEG responses. When no analgesia was used, <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> using cautery iron ameliorated EEG indicators of nociception, relative to docking using clippers. Thus, prior administration of EMLA cream or the use of cautery iron in place of clippers have the potential to reduce the acute pain during routine <b>tail</b> <b>docking.</b> Acute EEG responses of pigs to the noxious stimulus of <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> varied significantly with postnatal age over the first 15 days of life. Docking at 1 day-of-age elicited no EEG evidence of nociception, whilst cortical responsiveness to <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> increased with postnatal age across the range of 5 – 15 days. This enhanced responsiveness may be due to the gradual withdrawal of fetal neurosuppressive mechanisms after birth, or rapid postnatal maturation of the cerebral cortex, or a combination of both. <b>Tail</b> <b>docking</b> using both side clippers and cautery iron resulted in the formation of neuromas, which have been associated with neuropathic pain, in the tail stump. Neither the proportion of tails with neuromas, nor the degree of abnormal nerve proliferation in the tail tip differed between the two docking methods. This suggests no longer-term welfare advantage of one method over the other, at least in terms of the potential for alterations in pain processing following stimulation of tail stump nociceptors. In terms of best practice guidelines for the performance of <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> in pigs, this research provides support for current recommendations that <b>tail</b> <b>docking,</b> along with other painful husbandry procedures, be performed within one week of birth. Furthermore, <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> with cautery induced less acute pain than docking with clippers, whilst both methods cause long-term changes in neural morphology in the <b>tail</b> stump. <b>Docking</b> using cautery may therefore be preferable to docking with clippers. Whilst cautery reduces the acute pain associated with docking relative to clippers, prior application of a topical anaesthetic cream (EMLA) completely abolished acute nociceptive responses to.

40|$|In {{spite of}} European {{legislation}} attempting to limit this practice, <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> is nowadays the only preventive measure against tail biting which is widely adopted by farmers.
