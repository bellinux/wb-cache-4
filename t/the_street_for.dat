5|$|The capitol {{contained}} three {{rooms and}} quickly became {{too small for}} the state government, which had to erect additional office buildings across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>for</b> the state's administration. The lower floor of the statehouse was used by the Indiana House of Representatives. The upper floor was split into two rooms, one for the Indiana State Senate and another for the Indiana Supreme Court, with a narrow hall between them. The building was abandoned as the capitol in 1824 and was given to Harrison County to use as a courthouse. The old capitol building is still preserved and is now a state historic site.|$|E

A story {{planned for}} the fourth series of The Sarah Jane Adventures, it would have seen many {{children}} avoiding a strange street next to Bannerman Road, called Sally Lane, after hearing an urban legand which states {{if you go in}} the street, she will eat you alive. Sarah Jane and the gang investigate, and find a twelve-year-old girl, who was trapped in <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>for</b> years by an evil spirit, called the 'Trickster's Triangle'.|$|E
5|$|On the way home, Peter and Brian argue until Brian {{gets out}} of the car. A police officer gives Brian a ticket, for which Peter has to pay $10, for violating the local leash law, which only widens the rift between Peter and Brian. Another {{argument}} ensues and Peter mentions that he found Brian on the road as a stray dog. Angry that Peter brought that up and becoming more angry when Peter then demands that Brian stop being a bad dog, Brian leaves the house, whereupon he is treated cruelly by the community, and is (ultimately) forced to sleep at the bus shelter. Peter buys a new cat which turns out to be mischievous and abusive; the family gets rid of it and searches for Brian. By the time Peter decides to apologize to Brian, Brian has been kicked out of a restaurant and a public store and chased by the police when he was found drinking from a water fountain. Brian becomes homeless, having actually attacked a man on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>for</b> treating him as a drunken hobo and for not believing that he was not a good dog but a crazy animal. He is subsequently taken away by the police.|$|E

5|$|The episode's {{establishing}} exterior shots, {{and those}} of Tooms' house, were filmed around Hastings Street in Vancouver. When filming the first shot of Tooms' eyes glowing from a storm drain, the production crew arrived too late to secure <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>for</b> filming, and a nearby construction crew were temporarily drafted to guard the area. The ventilation system through which the first victim is attacked at night {{was meant to be}} of a multistory car park. However, to avoid a costly tenting operation to simulate night-time, a replica of the necessary parts of the ventilation system was built in a lower level of the car park. Exterior shots of Scully's apartment were also filmed in Vancouver, at the same location used in the pilot episode. However, this location's use was later discontinued owing to the limited range of shots it afforded; most reverse angles would show a large car park across the street.|$|E

25|$|Willis {{gained a}} large cult {{following}} in the 1990s, particularly {{after the release of}} his 1995 Greatest Hits album on the Alternative Tentacles label. Jello Biafra compiled the album's track list. In addition to a large body of solo musical work, Willis fronted his own punk rock band, the Wesley Willis Fiasco, during the 1990s. He was also a visual artist long before he developed an interest in music, and produced hundreds of intricate, unusual, colored ink-pen drawings, most of them of various Chicago streetscapes; he frequently sold these on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>for</b> between $20 and $40.|$|E

25|$|Twelve {{people were}} killed outright, and another two died over the {{following}} days and weeks. Thirteen of the fourteen victims were women, including one who was nine months pregnant. One young {{woman who had been}} beside the bomb car was decapitated; the only clue to her sex was the pair of brown platform boots she was wearing. Several others lost limbs and a man was impaled through the abdomen by an iron bar. Several bodies lay in <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>for</b> half an hour as ambulances struggled to get through traffic jams. At least four bodies were found on the pavement outside Guineys. The bodies of the victims were covered by newspapers until they were removed from the scene.|$|E
25|$|Tange {{organised}} {{the spaces}} of the three firms by function {{to allow them to}} share common facilities. He stacked these functions vertically according to need, for example, the printing plant is on the ground floor to facilitate access to <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>for</b> loading and transportation. He then took all the service functions including elevators, toilets and pipes and grouped them into 16 reinforced concrete cylindrical towers, each with an equal 5 metre diameter. These he placed on a grid into which he inserted the functional group facilities and offices. These inserted elements were conceived of as containers that were independent of the structure and could be arranged flexibly as required. This conceived flexibility distinguished Tange's design from other architects' designs with open floor offices and service cores – such as Kahn's Richards Medical Research Laboratories. Tange deliberately finished the cylindrical towers at different heights to imply that there was room for vertical expansion.|$|E
25|$|Caseros {{was used}} as a place to {{dismantle}} stolen cars during the 1990s. At the time there was also a mysterious episode in which two inmates were allowed out into <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>for</b> a night to go on a robbing spree. They shot and killed someone {{in the course of the}} night, and their faces were caught on camera. The next morning they were safely back in their cells, but the police identified them through the videotapes and began to investigate. Within the next three weeks, one of the inmates was found dead in his cell, apparently as a result of suicide. But his fellow inmates doubted the possibility of suicide, since he hadn't shown any signs of being suicidal. The guards who had let them out for a night in exchange for a cut of the booty were obvious suspects. Eventually all the guards were arrested as a part of the investigation, and held in custody for nearly a year. One guard was tried and found guilty of murder, receiving a sentence of twenty years in prison.|$|E

25|$|Fully {{autonomous}} vehicles, {{also known}} as driverless cars, already exist in prototype (such as the Google driverless car), {{and are expected to}} be commercially available around 2020. According to urban designer and futurist Michael E. Arth, driverless electric vehicles—in conjunction with the increased use of virtual reality for work, travel, and pleasure—could reduce the world's 800 million vehicles to a fraction of that number within a few decades. This would be possible if almost all private cars requiring drivers, which are not in use and parked 90% of the time, would be traded for public self-driving taxis that would be in near constant use. This would also allow for getting the appropriate vehicle for the particular need—a bus could come for a group of people, a limousine could come for a special night out, and a Segway could come for a short trip down <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>for</b> one person. Children could be chauffeured in supervised safety, DUIs would no longer exist, and 41,000 lives could be saved each year in the US alone.|$|E
25|$|However, the Sotenos {{are best}} known for Tree of Life sculptures. The {{time it takes to}} {{complete}} a Tree depends on size and complexity, anywhere from a day to two months of 15-hour workdays. Sizes can range from twenty centimeters to over a meter in height. The sculptures are made from the reddish and yellow clays found in a nearby community called Ocotitlán. The mined clay is left out to dry and the clumps broken up, sometimes but putting them out into <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>for</b> cars to roll over. As needed, the powdered clay is mixed with water and a flower called “tule” to soften and whiten the clay. The small details may be made with molds, but a number of artisans in the family, including Oscar, prefer to do it all by hand. Details and branches may be attached or reinforced by wire, but both Oscar and Tiburcio avoid the use of wire as it can break over time. The piece is carefully dried and fired. The largest trees may be fired in separate parts and in stages. Then they painted with anilines, natural pigments, acrylics and sometimes enamel.|$|E
25|$|Southland Life vacated {{the complex}} when Cityplace Center was opened in 1988. The hotel tower left Sheraton in 1990 and was renamed the Harvey Hotel in 1994. In 1990, a central tower {{addition}} of 25 floors and bay windows was proposed {{to make the}} complex competitive to newer projects going up in the city. However, the office towers sat vacant until 1996, when HBE Corp. purchased the entire 1.5 million-square-foot complex from New York Life, {{as well as the}} entire block across <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>for</b> a total of $40 million. At a further cost of $170 million, HBE redeveloped all three towers into one large hotel and built a convention center on the adjacent block, linked by skybridges. The Harvey Hotel tower remained open throughout the work. HBE placed the finished hotel within their Adam's Mark chain, naming it the Adam's Mark Dallas. The 1844-room hotel opened in October 1998. DART's adjacent light rail line and Pearl Station were major factors in converting the complex into a first-rate convention facility. A parking garage and 3-story convention building were constructed on an adjoining block to the southwest, and the building's facade of glass mosaics was painted gray during the building's conversion.|$|E

25|$|On the IRT Pelham Line in 1980, a {{sharp rise in}} window-smashing on subway cars caused $2 {{million in}} damages; it spread to other lines {{during the course of}} the year. When the broken windows were {{discovered}} in trains that were still in service, they needed to be taken out of service, causing additional delays; in August 1980 alone, 775 vandalism-related delays were reported. Vandalism of subway cars, including windows, continued through the mid-1980s; between January 27 and February 2, 1985, 1,129 pieces of glass were replaced on subway cars on the , , , , and K trains. Often, bus transfers, sold on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>for</b> 50 cents, were also sold illegally, mainly at subway-to-bus transfer hubs. Mayor Koch even proposed to put a subway court in the Times Square subway station to speed up arraignments, as there were so many subway-related crimes by then. Meanwhile, high-ranking senior City Hall and transit officials considered raising the fare from 60 to 65 cents to fund additional transit police officers, who began to ride the subway during late nights (between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m.) owing to a sharp increase in crime in 1982. Operation High Visibility, commenced in June 1985, had this program extended to 6 a.m., and a police officer was to be present on every train in the system during that time.|$|E
