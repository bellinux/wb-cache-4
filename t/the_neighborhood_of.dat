5|$|A dwarf {{planet is}} a planetary-mass object that {{is neither a}} planet nor a natural satellite. That is, it is in direct orbit of a star, and is massive enough for its gravity to crush it into a hydrostatically equilibrious shape (usually a spheroid), but has not cleared <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> other {{material}} around its orbit.|$|E

5|$|Sonia Maria Sotomayor {{was born}} in the New York City borough of The Bronx. Her father was Juan Sotomayor (born c. 1921), from the area of Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico, and her mother was Celina Báez (born 1927), an orphan from <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> Santa Rosa in Lajas, a still mostly rural area on Puerto Rico's {{southwest}} coast.|$|E
5|$|As {{we already}} saw above, the nematic liquid {{crystals}} {{are composed of}} rod-like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector n called the director, is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules in <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> any point. Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis, n and -n are fully equivalent.|$|E

5|$|Hurricanes (or their remnants) {{occasionally}} track {{through the}} area in late summer and early fall, but are often weak {{by the time they}} reach Washington, partly due to the city's inland location. Flooding of the Potomac River, however, caused by a combination of high tide, storm surge, and runoff, has been known to cause extensive property damage in <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> Georgetown.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, these {{algorithms}} can {{be extended}} to other, non-perfect, classes of graphs as well. For instance, in a circle graph, <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> each vertex is a permutation graph, so a maximum clique in a circle graph can be found by applying the permutation graph algorithm to each neighborhood. Similarly, in a unit disk graph (with a known geometric representation), there is a polynomial time algorithm for maximum cliques based on applying the algorithm for complements of bipartite graphs to shared neighborhoods of pairs of vertices.|$|E
5|$|Landslides {{encompass}} smaller areas, develop on {{the steep}} cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly {{located in the}} artificial loess hills of Zemun: Gardoš, Ćukovac and Kalvarija. However, {{the majority of the}} land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). <b>The</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> Mirijevo is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighborhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.|$|E

5|$|Passing {{the park}} gate, M-203 {{continues}} northeasterly. The roadway skirts the northern shore of Bear Lake {{on the eastern}} end of the state park. At Lakeshore Drive, M-203 turns inland running due east to Cloverland Road then turning north and east along Veterans Memorial Highway. Along this section of roadway, the AADT was measured at 440vehicles in 2007. The highway follows Veterans Memorial Highway through <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> Tamarack west of Calumet. From there it continues eastward, following Pine Street north of downtown Calumet, looping back to US41/M-26. The northern terminus of M-203 is at the intersection of Pine Street and Calumet Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} drawback of {{the classical}} Fourier transformation is a rather narrow class of functions (originals) for which it can be effectively computed. Namely, {{it is necessary that}} these functions decrease sufficiently rapidly to zero (in <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> infinity) in order to ensure the existence of the Fourier integral. For example, the Fourier transform of such simple functions as polynomials does not exist in the classical sense. The extension {{of the classical}} Fourier transformation to distributions considerably enlarged the class of functions that could be transformed and this removed many obstacles.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> Wadi Salib, {{located in}} the heart of {{downtown}} Haifa, is being redeveloped. Most of its Jewish and Arab residents are considered squatters and have been gradually evicted over the years. The Haifa Economic Corporation Ltd is developing two 1,000 square meter lots for office and commercial use. Some historic buildings have been renovated and redeveloped, especially into nightclubs and theaters, such as the Palace of the Pasha, a Turkish bathhouse, and a Middle Eastern music and dance club, which has been converted into theaters and offices.|$|E

5|$|Culik {{begins with}} the {{observation}} that a cellular automaton has an injective transition function {{if and only if}} the transition function is injective on the subsets of configurations that are periodic (repeating the same substring infinitely often in both directions). He defines a nondeterministic finite-state transducer that performs the transition rule of the automaton on periodic strings. This transducer works by remembering <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> the automaton {{at the start of the}} string and entering an accepting state when that neighborhood concatenated to the end of the input would cause its nondeterministically chosen transitions to be correct. Culik then swaps the input and output of the transducer. The transducer resulting from this swap simulates the inverse dynamics of the given automaton. Finally, Culik applies previously known algorithms to test whether the resulting swapped transducer maps each input to a single output.|$|E
5|$|Diarra {{was born}} in the commune of Villepinte in the {{department}} of Seine-Saint-Denis to Malian parents. He has three younger brothers and one sister. One of his brothers, Zanké, is also a footballer and currently plays for French club Quevilly in the Championnat National, the third division of French football. He had previously played for the reserve team of professional club Paris Saint-Germain, but was released in 2010. Another brother, Idrissa, assists in running a social networking site that helps amateur footballers find a club. Diarra and his siblings were raised in <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> Rose des Vents located in the nearby commune of Aulnay-sous-Bois, where his parents still reside. He is currently married and has two children. On 28 May 2010, ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Diarra departed the national team's training camp to be beside his wife as she gave birth to his second child.|$|E
5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Norway {{as part of}} the Second World War, the Wehrmacht wanted a railway route past Trondheim which was guarded against sabotage. They decided {{that the best way to}} do this was to build a tunnel under <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> Tyholt. However, construction of the tunnel took much longer than expected, so instead Wehrmach started laying railway tracks in the streets in Trondheim. They planned that the railway would branch from the Dovre Line at Skansen Station and then follow Sandgata and Olav Tryggvasons gate, cross Nidelva on Bakke Bridge and then run up Innherredsveien before reaching the Meråker Line at Lademoen Station. However, by German capitulation on 8 May 1945, construction of the railway had only reached Søndre gate.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, {{the results}} of a search for giant planets in the {{globular}} cluster 47 Tucanae were announced. The lack of any successful discoveries suggests that the abundance of elements (other than hydrogen or helium) necessary to build these planets may need to be at least 40% of the abundance in the Sun. Terrestrial planets are built from heavier elements such as silicon, iron and magnesium. The very low abundance of these elements in globular clusters means that the member stars have a far lower likelihood of hosting Earth-mass planets, when compared to stars in <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> the Sun. Hence the halo region of the Milky Way galaxy, including globular cluster members, are unlikely to host habitable terrestrial planets.|$|E
5|$|Lynch, {{the fourth}} of six children, was born March 31, 1955, in <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> South Boston. He was raised with his five sisters in the Old Colony Housing Project. His father, Francis Lynch, was an {{ironworker}} who {{had dropped out of}} school in the eighth grade. His mother, Anne (née Havlin), was a night-shift post office worker. Both parents came from fourth-generation South Boston families. He attended St. Augustine Elementary School and South Boston High School. During high school vacations he began working in construction alongside his father. After graduating from high school in 1973, Lynch became an apprentice ironworker. For the next six years he worked on high-altitude structural ironwork throughout the United States for various companies, including General Motors and U.S. Steel.|$|E
