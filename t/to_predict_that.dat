5|$|Supporters of {{the project}} {{suggested}} that the cheap electricity provided by the dam would be a strong enticement for electricity-intensive industries, such as aluminum smelting, to move to Alaska. They were encouraged by a 1962 economic feasibility study by the Development and Resources Corporation, which stated that the electricity generated would attract aluminum, magnesium and titanium industries to the region and help process locally produced minerals. The report also stated that the dam would attract a wood pulp mill on at least a temporary basis to process {{the hundreds of millions}} of board feet of timber that would otherwise be lost as the dam's reservoir flooded. The authors of the DRC report were specific enough <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> <b>that</b> 19,746 jobs would be created by the dam's construction—not including jobs opened during the construction process. Both the 1962 study, and another report by University of Michigan researcher Michael Brewer in 1966, stated that tens of thousands of jobs would be created by the construction process alone, even if the cheap electricity generated by the dam failed to attract any additional industries to Alaska.|$|E
5|$|This theory {{stems from}} the various rumours {{spreading}} after Centaurs sinking. If Centaur had been in breach of the Hague Convention of 1907, and someone had informed the Japanese of this, I-177 may have been under valid orders to attack. When Centaur left Sydney, her decks were packed with green-uniformed men, and as Field Ambulance uniforms were only distinguishable from other Army uniforms by badge insignia and the colouration of the cloth band ringing the hat, a distant observer could {{have concluded that the}} hospital ship was transporting soldiers. Those witnessing the loading in Sydney would have seen the ambulance drivers bring their weapons aboard, and could have come to a similar conclusion. If a spy or informant had passed this information to the Japanese, I-177 could have been lying in wait. The main flaw in this theory is the question of how Nakagawa and his crew were able <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> <b>that</b> Centaur was taking an alternative route and how they were able to determine the new route selected.|$|E

This geologic diversity contrasts with the ancient, heavily cratered surface of Mimas, another moon of Saturn slightly smaller than Enceladus.

40|$|The {{use of an}} {{imaging radar}} {{polarimeter}} data for unsupervised classification of scattering behavior is described by comparing the polarization properties of each pixel in a image to that of simple classes of scattering such as even number of reflections, odd number of reflections, and diffuse scattering. For example, when this algorithm is applied to data acquired over the San Francisco Bay area in California, it classifies scattering by the ocean as being similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>predicted</b> by the class of odd number of reflections, scattering by the urban area as being similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>predicted</b> by the class of even number of reflections, and scattering by the Golden Gate Park as being similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>predicted</b> by the diffuse scattering class. It also classifies the scattering by a lighthouse in the ocean and boats on the ocean surface as being similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>predicted</b> by the even number of reflections class, {{making it easy to}} identify these objects against the background of the surrounding ocean. The algorithm is also applied to forested areas and shows that scattering from clear-cut areas and agricultural fields is mostly similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>predicted</b> by the odd number of reflections class, while the scattering from tree-covered areas generally is classified as being a mixture of pixels exhibiting the characteristics of all three classes, although each pixel is identified with only a single class...|$|R
