40|$|By {{investigating}} {{the distribution of}} phrase pairs in phrase <b>translation</b> <b>tables,</b> the work in this paper describes an approach {{to increase the number}} of n-gram alignments in phrase <b>translation</b> <b>tables</b> output by a sampling-based alignment method. This approach consists in enforcing the alignment of n-grams in distinct translation subtables so as {{to increase the number of}} n-grams. Standard normal distribution is used to allot alignment time among translation subtables, which results in adjustment of the distribution of n- grams. This leads to better evaluation results on statistical machine translation tasks than the original sampling-based alignment approach. Furthermore, the translation quality obtained by merging phrase <b>translation</b> <b>tables</b> computed from the sampling-based alignment method and from MGIZA++ is examined.

The <b>translation</b> <b>tables</b> were cached in the CPU resulting, in most cases, in an overhead of only one microinstruction when performing address translation.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} {{two aspects of}} Machine Translation: {{parallel}} corpora and translation model. First, we present a method to automatically build parallel corpora from subtitle files. We use subtitle files gathered from the Internet. This leads to useful data for Subtitling Machine Translation. Our method is based on Dynamic Time Warping. We evaluated this alignment method by comparing it with a sample aligned by hand and we obtained a precision of alignment equal to $ 0. 92 $. Second, we use the notion of inter-lingual triggers {{in order to build}} from the subtitle parallel corpora multilingual dictionaries and <b>translation</b> <b>tables</b> for machine <b>translation.</b> Inter-lingual triggers allow to detect couple of source and target words from parallel corpora. The Mutual Information measure used to determine inter-lingual triggers allows to hypothesize that a word in the source language is a translation of another word in the target language. We evaluate the obtained dictionary by comparing it to two existing dictionaries. Then, we integrated the obtained <b>translation</b> <b>tables</b> into an entire translation decoding process supplied by Pharaoh. We compared the translation performance using our <b>translation</b> <b>tables</b> with the performance obtained by the Giza++ tool. The results showed that the system tuned for our tables improves the Bleu value by 2. 2 % compared to the ones obtained by Giza++...|$|R
