5|$|At the {{entrance}} to the south transept is <b>the</b> <b>organ.</b> This is by Forster and Andrews, of Hull. This organ building company was formed by James Alderson Forster (1818–1886) and Joseph King Andrews (1820–1896). The business developed and {{became one of the most}} successful of the North of England organ builder. The business was taken over by John Christie in 1924 and finally wound up in 1956. As well as their Hull headquarters, the company had branches in London and York. <b>The</b> <b>organ</b> dates from 1885. It was a gift from Sir Pryse Pryse, Bt DL JP, of Gogerddan. <b>The</b> <b>organ</b> has a pine case, and painted pipes.|$|E

5|$|Built by J.W.Walker and Sons, <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> was {{completed}} {{only two days}} before the opening of the cathedral in 1967. Made {{as an integral part of}} the new cathedral, the architect, Frederick Gibberd, saw the casework as part of his brief and so designed the striking front to <b>the</b> <b>organ.</b> Using decorative woodwork, Gibberd was inspired by the innovative use of the pipes at Coventry Cathedral and the Royal Festival Hall and so arranged the shiny zinc pipes and brass trumpets en chamade to contrast strikingly with concrete pillars which surround <b>the</b> <b>organ.</b>|$|E
40|$|Using the {{computer}} code Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP), doses {{were calculated for}} organs of interest such as the large intestine, urinary bladder, testes, and kidneys while patients were undergoing prostate brachytherapy. This research is important because the doses delivered to the prostate are extremely high and <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> near <b>the</b> prostate are potentially at risk for receiving high doses of radiation, leading to increased probabilities of adverse health effects such as cancer. In this research, two MCNP version 4 C codes were {{used to calculate the}} imparted energies to <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> of interest delivered by 125 I and 103 Pd. As expected, <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> nearest to <b>the</b> prostate received the highest energy depositions and <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> farthest from <b>the</b> prostate received the lowest energy depositions. Once the energy depositions were calculated, the doses to <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> were calculated using the known volumes and densities of <b>the</b> <b>organs.</b> Finally, <b>the</b> doses to <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> over an infinite time period were calculated...|$|R

5|$|Different {{national}} {{styles of}} organ building began to develop, often due to changing political climates. In the Netherlands, <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> became a large instrument with several divisions, doubled ranks, and mounted cornets. The organs of northern Germany also had more divisions, and independent pedal divisions became increasingly common. The divisions of <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> became visibly discernible {{from the case}} design. 20th-century musicologists labelled this the Werkprinzip.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, {{an organ}} by Gray & Davison of London was {{installed}} in the cathedral, replacing an instrument with parts dating back to 1626. <b>The</b> <b>organ</b> was rebuilt and enlarged by Whiteley Bros of Chester in 1876, to include harmonic flutes and reeds by Cavaillé-Coll. It was later moved to its present position {{at the front of}} the north transept. In 1910 William Hill and Son of London extensively rebuilt and revoiced <b>the</b> <b>organ,</b> replacing the Cavaillé-Coll reeds with new pipes of their own. The choir division of <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> was enlarged and moved behind the choirstalls on the south side. The instrument was again overhauled by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool in 1969, when a new mechanism and some new pipework made to a design by the organist, Roger Fisher, was installed. Since 1991 <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> has been in the care of David Wells of Liverpool.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, organ {{builders}} {{began to}} build instruments in concert halls and other large secular venues, allowing <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> {{to be used as}} part of an orchestra, as in Saint-Saëns' Symphony No. 3. Frequently <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> is given a soloistic part, such as in Joseph Jongen's Symphonie Concertante for Organ & Orchestra, Francis Poulenc's Concerto for Organ, Strings and Tympani, and Frigyes Hidas' Organ Concerto.|$|E

50|$|At {{this stage}} <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> are exposed. Usually, <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> are removed in a {{systematic}} fashion. Making a decision as to what order <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> are to be removed will depend highly on the case in question. Organs can be removed in several ways: The first is the en masse technique of Letulle whereby all <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> are removed as one large mass. The second is the en bloc method of Ghon. The most popular in the UK is {{a modified version of}} this method, which is divided into four groups of organs. Although these are the two predominant evisceration techniques, in the UK variations on these are widespread.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{abdominal}} wall defects that result due to the changes during development. They are omphalocele and gastroschisis. Gastroschisis develops when the abdominal wall does not completely close, and <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> are present outside of the infant’s body. Omphalocele occurs when some of <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> protrude through <b>the</b> muscles of the abdomen in the area surrounding the umbilical cord. Omphalocele can be either minor, with only some of <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> exposed, or severe, with most, {{if not all of}} <b>the</b> abdominal <b>organs</b> being exposed.|$|R
5|$|Other composers {{who have}} used <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> {{prominently}} in orchestral music include Gustav Holst, Richard Strauss, Ottorino Respighi, Gustav Mahler, Anton Bruckner, and Ralph Vaughan Williams. Because these concert hall instruments could approximate the sounds of symphony orchestras, transcriptions of orchestral works found a place in <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> repertoire. As silent films became popular, theatre organs were installed in theatres to provide accompaniment for the films.|$|E
5|$|The 4-manual Ernest M. Skinner {{pipe organ}} has 2,939pipes and remains {{essentially}} the same today as when it was installed in 1931 and tonally finished by G. Donald Harrison, as Skinner's opus 839. <b>The</b> <b>organ</b> underwent a complete restoration between 2002–2005, with all original 45ranks of the instrument fully preserved. A 99-memory level Capture System was added to <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> in 2005.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>organ</b> {{has four}} manuals, 88speaking stops and 4565pipes. It works {{by way of}} air pressure, {{controlled}} by an electric current and operated by the keys of <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> console; this opens and closes valves within the wind chests, allowing the pipes to speak. This type of motion is called electro-pneumatic action.|$|E

5|$|Above the {{entrance}} to the chapel is an oriel that, until the 1880s, was a room on the first floor that formed part of a set of rooms that were occupied by Richard Whately, and later by John Henry Newman. Whately is said to have used the space as a larder and Newman is said to have used it for his private prayers — when <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> was installed in 1884, the space was used for the blower. The wall that once separated the room from the ante-chapel was removed, making it accessible from the chapel. <b>The</b> <b>organ</b> was built by J. W. Walker & Sons in 1988; in 1991 the space behind <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> was rebuilt as an oratory and memorial to Newman and the Oxford Movement.
