25|$|In {{addition}} to giving support and reassurance during distress, another important function of caregiving within intimate relationships is {{the provision of}} support for a relationship partner's personal growth, exploration, and goal strivings. In attachment theory, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> is called providing a secure base and is postulated to encourage the relationship partner's confident, autonomous exploration of the environment outside of the attachment relationship. This phenomenon was originally observed in young children; children whose parents showed more intrusiveness {{were less likely to}} engage in play and exploration in a novel environment.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people with}} {{developmental}} disabilities live in residential accommodation (also known as group homes) with other people with similar assessed needs. These homes are usually staffed around the clock, and usually house between 3 and 15 residents. The prevalence of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> is gradually decreasing, however, as residential accommodation is replaced by at-home and community support, which can offer increased choice and self-determination for individuals. Some U.S. states still provide institutional care, such as the Texas State Schools. The type of residential accommodation is usually determined by the level of developmental disability and mental health needs.|$|E
25|$|Science and {{mathematics}} in the Islamic world during the Middle Ages followed various models {{and modes of}} funding varied based primarily on scholars. It was extensive patronage and strong intellectual policies implemented by specific rulers that allowed scientific knowledge to develop in many areas. Funding for translation of scientific texts in other languages was ongoing throughout the reign of certain caliphs, {{and it turned out}} that certain scholars became experts in the works they translated and in turn received further support for continuing to develop certain sciences. As these sciences received wider attention from the elite, more scholars were invited and funded to study particular sciences. An example of a translator and mathematician who benefited from this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> was al-Khawarizmi. A notable feature of many scholars working under Muslim rule in medieval times is that they were often polymaths. Examples include the work on optics, maths and astronomy of Ibn al-Haytham.|$|E

2500|$|The central {{component}} of effective caregiving is the taking on of what Batson (1991) called an empathic stance toward another person's suffering or needs. This means adopting the perspective, or [...] "putting oneself in the shoes", of the partner {{in order to}} help lessen his or her distress in a stressful situation, or to help him or her pursue personal growth and development goals in challenging contexts. The empathic stance is characterized by two key, related components: sensitivity and responsiveness (although note that these terms are sometimes used interchangeably in the caregiving and social support literatures). [...] Sensitivity refers to the ability to effectively detect and interpret the partner's cues of distress, worry, or need, and to provide the type and amount of support that is well matched to the partner's wants and needs. This tailoring of caregiving efforts to the particular characteristics of the specific situation is essential for effective care. Responsiveness is the ability to provide support {{in a way that makes}} the partner feel understood (i.e., the caregiver has accurately captured the speaker's problem, needs, and emotions), validated (i.e., the caregiver confirms that the care recipient is a valued individual and that his or her feelings and responses in the situation are reasonable), and cared for (i.e., caregiver should communicate affection and concern). Caregiving that lacks these two components may be ineffective or even detrimental to the care-recipient's well-being. For example, a study investigating the adjustment of breast cancer patients found that these women varied in the types of the support they desired, and mismatches between the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> wanted and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> received (i.e., low sensitivity to the partner’s unique support needs) predicted worse adjustment. [...] Unhelpful attempts at social support include: minimization (e.g., downplaying or denying the problem), maximization (e.g., catastrophizing, making the problem seem unwieldy or unresolvable), blaming or criticizing the partner for their misfortune, inducing feelings of guilt or indebtedness, [...] and overinvolvement (e.g., being overly protective, making the care-recipient feel incompetent, inserting oneself into the problem when the partner wishes to solve it independently).|$|E
2500|$|All {{humans have}} a fundamental, evolutionarily-rooted {{need to feel}} {{socially}} connected to other people (i.e., to achieve [...] "belongingness" [...] or [...] "relatedness"). Simultaneously, people also hold a need for [...] "autonomy", or the desire to maintain a sense of independence and self-sufficiency. While these two psychological needs may initially appear to be contradictory (that is, it is not readily apparent how people may reconcile their need for social connection with their need for independence), psychological research shows that individuals who are more dependent on their intimate partners for support actually experience more autonomy, rather than less (a phenomenon that has been labelled the [...] "dependency paradox"). For example, Feeney (2007) showed that individuals whose romantic partners were more comfortable with having their partner depend on them {{were more likely to}} independently pursue and achieve their personal goals over a period of 6 months (without their partner's direct assistance). Such research is consistent with the idea that the most effective <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for promoting personal growth (e.g., accepting challenges, trying new things, exploring) is support that involves simply communicating availability, and that individuals who feel confident in the availability of a secure base to fall back on in case their goal pursuits go wrong are less likely to actually over-rely on their secure base.|$|E
