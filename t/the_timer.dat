5|$|A timer {{ensured that}} the bomb would not explode until at least fifteen seconds after release, one-quarter of the {{predicted}} fall time, to ensure safety of the aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>timer</b> was activated when the electrical pull-out plugs connecting it to the airplane pulled loose as the bomb fell, switching it to internal (24V battery) power and starting <b>the</b> <b>timer.</b> At {{the end of the}} 15 seconds, the radar altimeters were powered up and responsibility was passed to the barometric stage.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Desmond and Locke {{discuss the}} purpose of the {{stations}} and discover that when Desmond accidentally allowed <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> to run out, the magnetic force pulled Oceanic Flight 815 toward the island, thus causing the crash. Locke continues to doubt that <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> has any meaning, but Desmond assures him that it is all real. As <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> passes zero, Desmond retrieves a failsafe key and crawls underneath the hatch, saying he will blow the dam. After he turns the key in the system termination switch, a shrill humming noise and violet-white light envelops the entire island, causing the Oceanic 815 survivors and the Others alike {{on opposite sides of the}} island to bend in apparent pain. That night, Charlie is the only person to return from the hatch; the whereabouts of Desmond, Eko, and Locke are not revealed. Charlie reconnects with Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), and they kiss as they sit among their fellow plane survivors.|$|E
5|$|The goal in each cavern is {{to locate}} both {{the end of}} level door and the special pillar which unlocks it. When stepped on, the pillar {{activates}} a countdown timer, during which the door is open. Once <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> is active, the player must get to the door before <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> ends and the door re-closes. There are multiple bonus games in between levels where the player can amass more treasure. Later levels include caveman villages where the player can purchase new tools with collected treasure as a currency.|$|E

Ayano tells Yohko to kill her in order to stop <b>the</b> Old <b>Timer's</b> Inheritance, and thus <b>the</b> Old <b>Timer's</b> Chronos system from destroying the universe.

40|$|The paper {{reports on}} {{research}} {{using a new}} type of pedestrian waiting countdown timer to influence pedestrian behaviour at signalised pedestrian crossings in Dublin. The aim was to evaluate the impact of <b>the</b> <b>timers</b> on pedestrian crossing behaviour and in particular to see if it had any impact on the number of illegal crossings (during red man [...] do not walk signal). <b>The</b> <b>timers</b> inform <b>the</b> pedestrian how many seconds they {{have to wait until the}} green man appears. Two surveys were used to evaluate the impact: an attitude survey to evaluate the perception of the users and a video survey to estimate quantitatively the impacts on pedestrian behaviour but also to evaluate the awareness levels of the pedestrians towards <b>the</b> countdown <b>timers.</b> Some of <b>the</b> results include observance of more compliant behaviour by females and that pedestrians tend to overestimate their waiting time. Before <b>the</b> <b>timers</b> were installed 65 % of pedestrians started to cross during the green man and amber phases but this rose to 76 % after <b>the</b> <b>timers</b> were installed. ...|$|R
5|$|Conceived by Amusement Vision head Toshihiro Nagoshi, Super Monkey Ball {{involves}} guiding {{a transparent}} ball containing {{one of four}} monkeys—AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon—across a series of maze-like platforms.

5|$|While at {{the funeral}} for Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez) and Libby, a boat comes into view out at sea. Jack, Sayid, and Sawyer swim out to it and climb onto the boat. They hear music coming from inside it. Shots are fired from inside the boat through the boat hatch entrance. After {{breaking}} the hatch open, they find a drunken Desmond piloting the boat. The next day, after Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) prevents Locke from destroying the computer that controls <b>the</b> <b>timer,</b> Locke enlists Desmond's help in letting <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> run down to zero. Desmond hotwires the blast doors shut, locking Eko outside the computer room and Desmond and Locke inside of it. Eko, distraught, seeks Charlie Pace's (Dominic Monaghan) help. The two attempt to use dynamite to blow the blast door open, but the blast doors are unscathed, while they are both injured.|$|E

5|$|William I. McLaughlin {{proposed}} {{a new strategy}} {{in the search for}} extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) in 1977. He suggested that widely observable events such as nova explosions might be used by intelligent extraterrestrials to synchronise the transmission and reception of their signals. This idea was tested by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in 1988, which used outbursts of Nova Cygni 1975 as <b>the</b> <b>timer.</b> Fifteen days of observation showed no anomalous radio signals coming from Epsilon Eridani.|$|E

5|$|The player {{directly}} {{controls the}} character Lightning through a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies throughout the game. The player can also turn the camera around the character, which allows for a 360° view of the surroundings. The world of Lightning Returns, as with Final Fantasy XIII and its sequel XIII-2, is rendered to scale with the character, who navigates the world on foot. In one of the areas, the player can use chocobos, a recurring animal in the Final Fantasy series. The player is able to freely navigate the game's open world layout, explore towns and country areas, and accept quests from various non-playable characters (NPCs). Lightning is also able to sprint for limited periods, climb up ladders and jump freely. The game features three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal and Hard, the latter of which is unlocked after first completing the game. There is also a New Game+ option, whereby players can start a new game while carrying over their equipment and stats from a previous playthrough. The in-game clock runs continuously during normal navigation, with one in-game day equating to {{two to three hours}} in real time on Easy mode and one hour on Normal and Hard modes. <b>The</b> <b>timer</b> starts out at seven in-game days, but can be extended to a maximum of thirteen days. <b>The</b> <b>timer</b> stops during cutscenes, conversations and battles. Lightning can also pause time using an ability called Chronostasis.|$|E

5|$|On July 2, 1996, an {{enormous}} alien mothership, that has one fourth {{the mass of}} the Moon, enters orbit around Earth, deploying gargantuan assault fortress saucers, each fifteen miles wide, that take positions over some of Earth's major cities and military bases. David Levinson, an MIT-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded in the global satellite transmissions that he determines is a timer counting down to a coordinated attack. With the help of his former wife, White House Communications Director Constance Spano, David, and his father Julius, gain access to the Oval Office and warn President Thomas J. Whitmore that the aliens are hostile. Thomas orders large-scale evacuations of New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C., but it is too late; <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> reaches zero and the saucers activate devastating directed-energy weapons, killing millions.

50|$|Interval timers {{are based}} on a free running, 32-bit, platform-dependent {{resolution}} timer. Such timers are normally used to specify timeouts on I/O, waiting on condition variables and other rudimentary thread scheduling. Since these timers have finite namespace and are free running, they can wrap at any time. NSPR does not provide an epoch, but expects clients to deal with that issue. The granularity of <b>the</b> <b>timers</b> is guaranteed to be between 10 microseconds and 1 millisecond. This allows a minimal timer period in of approximately 12 hours. But {{in order to deal with}} the wrap-around issue, only half that namespace may be utilized. Therefore, the minimal usable interval available from <b>the</b> <b>timers</b> is slightly less than six hours.|$|R
