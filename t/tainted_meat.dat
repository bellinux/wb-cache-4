2500|$|The {{campaign}} was contentious {{on the issues}} as well, with both the Liberals and Howard Hampton's New Democrats attacking the Tories' record in office. Various scandals and other unpopular moves reduced public opinion of the Tories going into the race, including the Walkerton water tragedy, the deaths of Dudley George and Kimberly Rogers, the possible sale of publicly owned electric utility Hydro One, the SARS outbreak, the decision to release the 2003 budget at an auto parts factory instead of the Legislature, the widespread blackout in August, and the Aylmer packing plant <b>tainted</b> <b>meat</b> investigation.

60|$|We strain at a gnat {{and swallow}} a camel; and, in this instance, the publichouses are kept open to furnish our luxury, while we deny {{ourselves}} other necessaries of life, {{out of a}} scruple of conscience. For example; in extreme hot weather, when meat will not keep from Saturday to Sunday, we throw, or cause to be thrown away, vast quantities of <b>tainted</b> <b>meat,</b> and have generally stinking dinners, because the butchers dare not sell a joint of meat on a Sunday morning. Now, though I {{would not have the}} Sabbath so far violated as to have it a market-day, yet, rather than abuse God's mercies by throwing away creatures given for our use, nay, for our own healths and cleanliness sake, I would have the same indulgence in extreme hot weather, as there is for milk and mackerel; that is to say, that meat might be killed in the cool of the morning, viz., {{one or two of the}} clock, and sold till nine, and no longer; nor should villanous informers have power to molest them in this innocent and reasonable amendment of a ridiculous vulgar error.|$|E
60|$|It is {{remarkable}} how readily and instantly retching or actual vomiting is induced in some persons by the mere {{idea of having}} partaken of any unusual food, as of an animal which is not commonly eaten; although {{there is nothing in}} such food to cause the stomach to reject it. When vomiting results, as a reflex action, from some real cause-- as from too rich food, or <b>tainted</b> <b>meat,</b> or from an emetic--it does not ensue immediately, but generally after a considerable interval of time. Therefore, to account for retching or vomiting being so quickly and easily excited by a mere idea, the suspicion arises that our progenitors must formerly have had the power (like that possessed by ruminants and some other animals) of voluntarily rejecting food which disagreed with them, or which they thought would disagree with them; and now, though this power has been lost, as far as the will is concerned, it is called into involuntary action, through the force of a formerly well-established habit, whenever the mind revolts at the idea of having partaken of any kind of food, or at anything disgusting. This suspicion receives support from the fact, of which I am assured by Mr. Sutton, that the monkeys in the Zoological Gardens often vomit whilst in perfect health, which looks as if the act were voluntary. We can see that as man is able to communicate by language to his children and others, the knowledge of the kinds of food to be avoided, he would have little occasion to use the faculty of voluntary rejection; so that this power would tend to be lost through disuse.|$|E

40|$|Hemorrhagic Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 strains {{and other}} virulent enteric {{pathogens}} can pose a serious health threat in <b>tainted</b> <b>meats,</b> poultry, and even drinking water. Traditional culture-based methods for assay of enteric pathogens in foods and water sources are relatively slow, and {{results can be}} ambiguous. Immunomagnetic separation (IMS) and detection methods have been investigated and appear promising for rapid bacterial assay of foods and environmental samples. In this work, a commercial sensor which combines IMS with electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection is evaluated for detection of E. coli O 157 and Salmonella typhimurium in foods and fomites. Results indicate that detection limits {{are in the range}} of 100 to 1, 000 bacteria per ml in pristine buffer for E. coli O 157 and S. typhimurium, respectively, or 1, 000 to 2, 000 bacteria per ml in food samples (depending on the sample) and that total processing and assay time is rapid (< 1 h) even in food samples. An immunologic "hook" or high-antigen-concentration prozone effect was observed above 10 (4) and 10 (5) bacteria per ml for E. coli O 157 and S. typhimurium, respectively. IMS was accomplished in milk, juices, serum, supernatant fluids from ground beef, finely minced chicken, and fish suspensions as well as several freshwater sources and followed by ECL assay. Some samples, especially fish, gave unexpectedly high background ECL. Conversely, low ECL intensity was observed in nonfat and 2 % fat milk samples, which appeared to be related to binding or entrapment of the antibody-coated magnetic beads by particulates in the milk, as revealed by microscopy. Results of this evaluation suggest the feasibility of immunomagnetic-ECL methodology for rapid, sensitive, and facile preliminary screening of various foods and fomites for the presence of virulent enteric pathogens...|$|R

When Phaeton, wishing to prove his heavenly birth by his beneficence, had the sun's chariot but one day, and drove out of the beaten track, he burned several blocks of houses in the lower streets of heaven, and scorched the surface of the earth, and dried up every spring, and made the great desert of Sahara, till at length Jupiter hurled him headlong to the earth with a thunderbolt, and the sun, through grief at his death, did not shine for a year.|$|R

50|$|Field {{dressing}} (verb) is {{the act of}} minimally dressing (butchering) {{an animal}} in {{a way as to}} reduce the amount of weight that must be carried by removing the rumen ("gutting"), and sometimes other internal organs such as the heart.

Castrates also have reduced feed efficiency and more fat than do entire males. More of the ingested energy therefore goes to fat tissue than to muscle tissue. The European wild boar is a seasonal short-day breeder and although domestic pigs breed all year round {{there are indications that}} they remain responsive to photoperiod. Since boar taint is closely associated with male sexual maturation, the use of artificial light regimens to delay puberty could be a non-invasive method of reducing boar taint in entire males. Therefore, a series of experiments were performed in order to study photoperiodism in young pigs. In two experiments, matched winter-born siblings of crossbred males were allocated after weaning to either one of two light-sealed rooms with high-intensit...|$|R
