25|$|We live, <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Information Age, yet {{almost none}} of the {{information}} we think we possess is true. Eskimos do not rub noses. The rickshaw was invented by an American. Joan of Arc was not French. Lenin was not Russian. The world is not solid, it is made of empty space and energy, and neither haggis, whisky, porridge, clan tartans or kilts are Scottish. So we stand, silent, on a peak in Darien a vast, rolling, teeming, untrodden territory before us. QI country. Whatever is interesting we are interested in. Whatever is not interesting, we are even more interested in. Everything is interesting if looked at in the right way. At one extreme, QI is serious, intensely scientific, deeply mystical; at the other it is hilarious, silly and frothy enough to please the most indolent couch-potato.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{volunteer}} {{can refer}} to any member of an Irish republican paramilitary, to a [...] "rank and file" [...] member, similar to a private, or to a member {{that is not a}} senior officer such as Chief of Staff or Quartermaster General. Joe McCann, an Official IRA member killed in 1972, was referred to in commemorations as a [...] "Staff Captain" [...] but also as a [...] "Volunteer". On the other hand, Joe Cahill, the commander of the Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade in 1971, said in a press conference after the introduction of internment that year, that British forces had only succeeded in arresting two officers of the Provisional IRA. [...] "The rest are volunteers, or as <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British Army, privates". The 'v' in [...] "volunteer" [...] {{may or may not be}} capitalized.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{estimated}} [...] {{to be between}} several tens of thousands and {{more than two hundred}} thousands of sedevacantists worldwide, mostly concentrated in the United States, Canada, France, the UK, Italy, and Australia, but the actual size of the sedevacantist movement has never been accurately assessed. (See further the section on statistics in the article Traditionalist Catholic.) Catholic doctrine teaches the four marks of the true Church are that it is One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic. [...] Sedevacantists base their claim to be the remnant Roman Catholic Church on {{what they see as the}} presence in them of these four [...] "marks", absent, <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Church since the Second Vatican Council. Their critics counter that sedevacantists are not one, forming numerous splinter groups, each of them in disagreement with the rest. [...] Most sedevacantists hold the Holy Orders conferred with the present revised rites of the Catholic Church to be invalid due to defect both of intention and form. Because they consider the 1968 revision of the rite of Holy Orders to have invalidated it, they conclude that the great majority of the bishops listed in the Holy See's Annuario Pontificio, including Benedict XVI and Francis themselves, are in reality merely priests or even laymen.|$|E

5000|$|The party's {{official}} {{launch a}} week before the commencement of the traditional Loya Jirga called by Karzai and just before <b>the</b> Bonn Conference <b>in</b> December was read as a show of force of their presence and that <b>they</b> have <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Afghanistan's future.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. Only Mr. Wildeve is twanky because 'tisn't a boy--that's what <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen, but I was not {{supposed}} to notice that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Facetiously.] Don't make 'im blush, Jenny. Accidents will 'appen in {{the best}} {{regulated}} families. And boys will be boys, as <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bible.|$|E

60|$|MATEY (shuffling). He won't tell, my lady. I {{think he}} is frightened that the police would step in if they knew how old he is. <b>They</b> do <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village that <b>they</b> {{remember}} him seventy years ago, looking just as he does to-day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Plucked! I {{never heard}} of such a thing. I think it is a great shame such a nice honest fellow should be so ill-used, and when all his pretty things have been stolen too! Do you know, they've taken up young Hornblower; but his friends have made off with the things, and <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> melting-pot by this time, and there's no chance of {{recovering}} them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But surely," [...] I persisted, {{smiling as}} cheerfully as I could, [...] "Nil desperandum, Mr Crimble. And {{you know what}} <b>they</b> <b>say</b> about fish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is hard fighting, <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dixmude district. The Germans {{carried the}} British {{trenches}} yesterday, and to-day the Allies {{will try to}} retake them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} what am I fit for? Very little, I am afraid. I {{have nothing but}} my good right arm, as <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> melodramas." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Alas for you, then, my poor sister!" [...] {{said the}} Old fear, sighing, as she uplifted her burden. [...] "We grand-children of Time {{are born to}} trouble. Happiness, <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> dwells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mansions of Eternity; but we can only lead mortals thither, step by step, with {{reluctant}} murmurings, and ourselves must perish on the threshold. But hark! my task is done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Troth,' {{said the}} stranger, {{stopping}} {{and looking at}} the friendly propounder, 'that's nae bad overture, as <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly. I have heard waur motions than that frae wiser counsel.' ...|$|E

60|$|The {{position}} was consolidated, as <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness stretcher-bearers were {{out over the}} half-mile. Like will-o'-the-wisps, with their shaded lanterns, they moved, hour after hour, slowly quartering the black honeycomb which lay behind the new British line. Now and then <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light of some star-shell their figures were disclosed, bending and raising the forms of the wounded, or wielding pick and shovel.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is what <b>they</b> <b>say</b> up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Far North," [...] replied Mrs. Quack. [...] "And {{it is true}} that Jack Frost {{had started}} down earlier than usual. That is how it happens we are here now. But about those hunters over by the Big River, do you suppose they will come over here?" [...] There was an anxious note in Mrs. Quack's voice.|$|R
5000|$|Spunky (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui) is Rocko's dog. Though not {{explicitly}} stated on the show, he is a Miniature Bull Terrier. <b>They</b> did <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> very first episode where Rocko gets a credit card, {{the guy at}} the dog bowl store calls him a whippet. Spunky emits foul odors, eats trash, drinks his saliva, and rolls in and eats Ed Bighead's salmon bushes, causing Mr. Bighead to feel annoyed.

2500|$|In Bobby Lee's [...] "Tae Do," [...] {{a parody}} of Korean dramas in a Mad TV episode, the {{subtitles}} make more sense of the story than the Korean language being spoken. [...] The subtitles are made to appear as though written by someone with a poor understanding of grammar and are often intentionally made longer than what <b>they</b> actually <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> drama. For example, an actor says [...] "Sarang" [...] ("I love you"), but the subtitle is [...] so long that it covers the whole screen.|$|R

This center includes a video room, a library, a small synagogue, a quiet room for visitors to compose <b>the</b> prayers <b>they</b> will <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ohel, and refreshments. The entrance to the Ohel is through the back door of this house and down a pathway. Men and women enter the Ohel through separate doors.|$|R
