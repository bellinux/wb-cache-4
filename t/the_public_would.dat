5|$|When released, Raptor Red was {{generally}} praised: Bakker's anthropomorphism {{was seen as}} a unique and positive aspect of the book, and his writing was described as folksy and heartfelt. Criticisms of the novel included a perceived lack of characterization and average writing. Some scientists, such as paleontologist David B. Norman, took issue with the scientific theories portrayed in the novel, fearing that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>would</b> accept them as fact, while Discovery Channel host Jay Ingram defended Bakker's creative decisions in an editorial.|$|E
5|$|In fact, Puccini was {{at first}} less than {{enthusiastic}} about the idea for this comic opera– Florence as a setting did not appeal to him, and he feared <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>would</b> have {{little interest in the}} subject. However, he soon became interested, and did some work on the piece even while composing Suor Angelica. The religious-themed opera was completed in September 1917, and Puccini turned his full attention to Gianni Schicchi, although the war news and the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which Puccini lost a sister, distracted him from his work. The first draft was completed on 20 April 1918, and Puccini continued to refine and orchestrate it through the summer of 1918.|$|E

5|$|When {{given the}} {{opportunity}} to host a public reception for President McKinley, fair organizers chose to site it in the Temple of Music—Louis L. Babcock, grand marshal of the Exposition, regarded the building as ideal for the purpose. The large auditorium was located close to the Esplanade, {{in the heart of the}} fair, and had doorways on each of its four sides. In addition to rows of chairs on the floor of the hall, it had spacious galleries. Babcock spent the morning of September 6 making some physical arrangements for the reception. Floor seating was removed to create a broad aisle, running from the east doors through which <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>would</b> be admitted, to where McKinley would stand. Once members of the public shook hands with McKinley, they would continue on to exit the building. An American flag was draped behind the President, both to screen him from behind and for decoration—several potted plants were arrayed around his place to create an attractive scene. Besides its utility for other purposes, the ornate building was one of the architectural features of the fair.|$|E
5|$|Within a fortnight, {{the navy}} had its first victory when the Asiatic Squadron, led by Commodore George Dewey, {{destroyed}} the Spanish navy at the Battle of Manila Bay in the Philippines. Dewey's overwhelming victory expanded {{the scope of}} the war from one centered in the Caribbean to one that would determine the fate of all of Spain's Pacific colonies. The next month, he increased the number of troops sent to the Philippines and granted the force's commander, Major General Wesley Merritt, the power to set up legal systems and raise taxes—necessities for a long occupation. By the time the troops arrived in the Philippines at the end of June 1898, McKinley had decided that Spain would be required to surrender the archipelago to the United States. He professed to be open to all views on the subject; however, he believed that as the war progressed, <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>would</b> come to demand retention of the islands as a prize of war.|$|E
5|$|Khan {{had wanted}} to cast Sabu Dastagir, a Hollywood star of Indian origin, as Birju. Dastagir {{travelled}} to India from Los Angeles, stayed in a hotel in Mumbai (then known as Bombay) and received a retainer. However, delays and obstacles in beginning shooting and getting a work permit for Dastagir led to his dismissal from the project. Dilip Kumar, an established actor in the Hindi film industry, had originally {{expressed an interest in}} playing Birju, which Khan found agreeable; Dilip Kumar agreed to play Shamu as well. However, Nargis objected that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>would</b> not accept their casting as mother and son because she had done several romantic films alongside him. Sunil Dutt—with the experience of just one film—was finally cast, after Mukri, a comedian in the film, introduced him to Khan. Sajid Khan, the actor who portrayed the young Birju, was unknown at the time, and was from a poor family from the Mumbai slums. Sajid's salary in the film was 750. He was later adopted by Mehboob Khan. Subsequently, Raaj Kumar was cast as Shamu and Rajendra Kumar as Ramu. Mother India was the first successful film and {{a turning point in the}} careers of Dutt, Raaj Kumar and Rajendra Kumar.|$|E

5|$|The {{railway network}} joined Burton in August 1839, {{which made it}} much more {{economical}} to distribute beer throughout the country. In 1842 William Worthington entered into partnership with Thomas Robinson, and the business traded as Worthington & Robinson. By 1861 Worthington employed 191 men and boys. Worthington dissolved the Robinson partnership in 1864, in order for his sons to acquire the business. The company became known as Worthington and Company, the co-partners being: William (1799-1871), {{with two of his}} sons, William Henry (1826-1894) and Calvert (1830-1871), who were joined two years later by his youngest son, Albert Octavius (1844-1918). After the introduction of agencies in British conurbations from the mid-1860s, the company began to rapidly expand. In 1866 the Prince of Wales awarded the company the Royal Warrant. Worthington pioneered brewing science from 1866 by employing a chemist, Horace Tabberer Brown, who led the world in separation and cultivation of pure yeast strains. From 1872 the Worthington brewery was the first in the world to systematically use a laboratory in the brewing process. The company had previously resisted employing a laboratory, for fear that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>would</b> perceive the scientific apparatus as a means of doctoring the beer. In order to differentiate themselves from other brewers, Worthington labelled their beers with alphabetical letters: their Burton Ales were called G, F and D, their light dinner ale was labelled M. Worthington E was an India Pale Ale, a competitor to Bass Pale Ale. By 1880, Worthington's IPA was challenging Bass's sales in the home market.|$|E
25|$|If current laws {{remained}} generally unchanged in the future, {{federal debt}} held by <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>would</b> decline slightly relative to GDP {{over the next}} few years. After that, however, growing budget deficits would push debt back to and above its current high level. Twenty-five years from now, in 2039, federal debt held by <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>would</b> exceed 100 percent of GDP. Moreover, debt would be on an upward path relative {{to the size of the}} economy, a trend that could not be sustained indefinitely. By 2039, the deficit would equal 6.5 percent of GDP, larger than in any year between 1947 and 2008, and federal debt held by <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>would</b> reach 106 percent of GDP, more than in any year except 1946—even without factoring in the economic effects of growing debt.|$|E

25|$|CBO {{estimated}} {{under the}} baseline scenario that the U.S. debt held by <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>would</b> increase approximately $8.5 trillion {{between the end}} of 2014 and 2024. Under a $2 trillion deficit reduction scenario during that first decade, federal debt held by the public in 2039 would stand at 75 percent of GDP, only slightly above the value of 72 percent at the end of 2013. Under a $4 trillion deficit reduction scenario for that decade, federal debt held by <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>would</b> fall to 42 percent of GDP in 2039. By comparison, such debt was 35 percent of GDP in 2007 and has averaged 39 percent of GDP during the past 40 years.|$|E

25|$|Woods was {{responsible}} for instituting better police training by introducing an official police academy modeled after Scotland Yard, which taught courses on law and sociology {{as well as physical}} training. A staunch advocate of community policing, Woods believed that the common rank-and-file policeman should be in a position of social importance and public value. He also felt that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>would</b> benefit if they were more informed of issues affecting the community and the local police precinct.

Under these conditions the first shot must cause the badger to collapse on the spot, limiting the choice of target sites to the spine, neck or head.|$|E
