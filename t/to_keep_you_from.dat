[...] The next day, {{the same group}} was brought before the governor, who directed the prison keeper to remove the men's hats. [...] He then addressed the group, [...] "We have made many laws and endeavored in several ways <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> among us, but neither whipping nor imprisonment, nor cutting off ears, nor banishment upon pain of death will keep you from among us. [...] We desire not your death." [...] Having met his obligation to present {{the position of the}} colony's authorities, he then pronounced, [...] "Hearken now to your sentence of death." [...] William Robinson then wanted to read a prepared statement about being called by the Lord to Boston, but the governor would not allow it to be read, and Robinson was sent back to prison. [...] Marmaduke Stephenson, being less vociferous than Robinson, was allowed to speak, and though initially declining, he ultimately spoke his mind, and then was also sent back to jail.|$|E
2500|$|CNET {{was also}} forced by parent company CBS to disqualify the newest Hopper with Sling model from the CES Best in Show award for 2013 {{because of its}} active {{litigation}} with the company. CEO Joe Clayton said that Dish was [...] "saddened that CNET's staff is being denied its editorial independence because of CBS' heavy handed tactics." [...] Dish Network directly attacked CBS for its decision in an advertisement for the device on its website. The ad proclaimed the DVR as being CNET's [...] "Best in Show", but with a footnote stating that [...] "CBS will go to any lengths <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> enjoying ad-skipping technologyeven censoring its own writers and throwing out their decision to name Hopper 'Best In Show.' Your vote {{is the only one}} that really matters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another type of {{stripped}} down and raw {{music with a}} variety of moods and a basic ensemble of guitar, bass, dobro or steel guitar (and later) drums became popular, especially among poor whites in Texas and Oklahoma. It became known as honky tonk and had its roots in Western swing and the ranchera music of Mexico and the border states, particularly Texas, together with the blues of the American South. Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys personified this music which has been described as [...] "a little bit of this, {{and a little bit of}} that, a little bit of black and a little bit of white... just loud enough <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> thinking too much and to go right on ordering the whiskey." [...] East Texan Al Dexter had a hit with [...] "Honky Tonk Blues", and seven years later [...] "Pistol Packin' Mama". These [...] "honky tonk" [...] songs associated barrooms, were performed by the likes of Ernest Tubb, Kitty Wells (the first major female country solo singer), Ted Daffan, Floyd Tillman, and the Maddox Brothers and Rose, Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams, would later be called [...] "traditional" [...] country. Williams' influence in particular would prove to be enormous, inspiring many of the pioneers of rock and roll, such as Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis, as well as Chuck Berry and Ike Turner, while providing a framework for emerging honky tonk talents like George Jones. Webb Pierce was the top-charting country artist of the 1950s, with 13 of his singles spending 113 weeks at number one. He charted 48 singles during the decade; 31 reached the top ten and 26 reached the top four.|$|E
60|$|Is it not {{therefore}} a wonderful mercy to be blessed with this grace of fear, that thou by it mayest be kept from final, which is damnable apostasy? Bless God, therefore, thou blessed man, that hast this grace {{of fear in}} thy soul.

6000|$|First. Had God given thee all the world, yet cursed hadst thou been, {{if he had}} {{not given}} thee the fear of the Lord; for the fashion of this world is a fading thing, but he that feareth the Lord shall abide for ever and ever. This {{therefore}} is the first thing that I would propound for thy encouragement, thou man that fears the Lord. This grace will dwell in thy heart, for it is a new covenant grace, and will abide with thee for ever. It is sent to <b>thee</b> <b>from</b> God, not only to join thy heart unto him, but <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>thee</b> <b>from</b> final apostasy--"I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me" [...] (Jer 32:40). That thou mayest never forsake God, is his design, and therefore, <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>thee</b> <b>from</b> that wicked thing, he hath put his fear in thy heart. Many are the temptations, difficulties, snares, traps, trials, and troubles that the people of God pass through in the world, but how shall they be kept, how shall they be delivered, and escape? Why, the answer is, The fear of God will keep them--"He that feareth God shall come forth of them all." ...|$|R
