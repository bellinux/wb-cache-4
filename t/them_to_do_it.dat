5|$|With his angelic powers {{partially}} restored, Castiel {{sets out}} to try and stop the angelic civil war. Having killed Bartholomew in self-defence, Castiel takes command {{of most of the}} Earth-bound angels, but finds himself opposed by Metatron, who is rallying angels to his side with the intention of painting Castiel as the villain of the piece. Although Castiel learns that his stolen grace will kill him eventually, he refuses Metatron's offer to side with him, eventually convincing Gadreel to ally with him in opposing Metatron's attempt to stage a coup of Heaven even as Metatron tricks the other angels into follow him by presenting Castiel as a despot willing to destroy everything to win the war, convincing angels to 'suicide bomb' themselves and claim that Castiel told <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Having gained access to Heaven's 'back door' after Gadreel sacrifices himself, Castiel defeats Metatron and throws him into Heaven's prison.|$|E

25|$|Catastrophe is {{not only}} about a {{political}} situation and {{the place of the}} artist in it. The victim or “protagonist” is also representative of all actors, having to portray what writers write for them in the way directors tell <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> (Beckett is not unaware of his own relationship with actors, particularly those who in the past have resisted his stage directions). The director in the play catches two prototypes, that of the political commissar and of the all-powerful personality director like Peter Brook, Vitez, , who bend a performance to their own interpretation, where often the victim is the author himself; there are many “in” theatrical jokes. The director’s assistant coolly carries out her instructions, and it matters little if we are in a concentration camp or a film studio: all humane considerations are ruled out to achieve the ultimate work of art. The two-pronged metaphor is incredibly effective for all its surface simplicity. In time, as with all of Beckett’s work, more strands and allusions will be discovered.|$|E

500|$|The group's [...] "golden rule", {{according}} to Field, {{was to make}} the content of their songs and shows [...] "developmentally appropriate and fun". [...] Their music, stage shows, and television and DVD productions were developed, as The New York Times reported, [...] "from the premise that a young child has a short attention span, is curious about a limited number of objects and activities, loves having a job to do and is thrilled by mastering basic movements". [...] They also respected their audience's intelligence and insight about entertainment, information, and honesty. [...] As Field said, [...] "Young children identify with relevant concepts, and enjoy being entertained and being part of the entertainment. They are willing to commit to interacting if you are direct, inclusive, and positive". [...] The group understood that challenging young children to engage in difficult tasks is more effective than simply telling <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> [...] They believed that young children were egocentric, so they stared continually into the camera in their videos and TV shows, and explained every action because they believed that young children needed to be told what to expect so that they do not feel left out and in order to feel safe.|$|E
2500|$|Roosevelt {{commented on}} {{his role in}} the battles: [...] "On the day of the big fight I had to ask my men to do a deed that European {{military}} writers consider utterly impossible of performance, that is, to attack over open ground an unshaken infantry armed with the best modern repeating rifles behind a formidable system of entrenchments. The only way to get <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in the way {{it had to be done}} was to lead them myself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although some Christians {{have relied}} on Christian {{teaching}} to justify their use of force, other Christians have opposed {{the use of force}} and violence. Some of the latter have formed sects that have emphasized pacificism as a central tenet of their faith. Christians have also engaged in violence against those that they classify as heretics and non-believers. In Letter to a Christian Nation, critic of religion Sam Harris writes that [...] "...faith inspires violence in at least two ways. First, people often kill other human beings because they believe that the creator of the universe wants <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it...</b> Second, far greater numbers of people fall into conflict with one another because they define their moral community {{on the basis of their}} religious affiliation..." ...|$|E
2500|$|No single {{profession}} [...] "owns" [...] {{spinal manipulation}} {{and there is}} little consensus as to which profession should administer SM, raising concerns by chiropractors that other medical physicians could [...] "steal" [...] SM procedures from chiropractors. A focus on evidence-based SM research has also raised concerns that the resulting practice guidelines could limit the scope of chiropractic practice to treating backs and necks. Two U.S. states (Washington and Arkansas) prohibit physical therapists from performing SM, some states allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> only if they have completed advanced training in SM, and some states allow only chiropractors to perform SM, or only chiropractors and physicians. Bills to further prohibit non-chiropractors from performing SM are regularly introduced into state legislatures and are opposed by physical therapist organizations.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his career, Ewbank {{was seen}} as a humble coach who had {{a good sense of humor}} and tried to stay out of the spotlight. He could also be harsh with his players, however. Before the 1958 {{championship}} game, he gave a speech telling his stars they needed to improve and had barely made the team. Unitas, he said, was obtained [...] "with a seventy-five-cent phone call" [...] and Ameche wasn't liked or wanted. Ewbank was not universally liked by his players. Second-string running back Jack Call later said the team won [...] "in spite of, not because of" [...] Ewbank. Other players saw him as overly easygoing, saying that while he was able to build teams up, he became too relaxed once he reached the top. [...] Hall of Famer Raymond Berry stated in his book All the Moves I Had [...] "What it amounts to is that Ewbank knew exactly what he wanted his team to do and how to get <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> well.. [...] Being under Weeb's system was the number one reason why Unitas and I had the careers we had." ...|$|E

2500|$|Raven-Symoné (credited as Raven), portrays Raven Lydia Baxter, is {{the main}} character. Aged 14–17. A precognitive teenager. She has a sassy {{attitude}} and a grand personality, and {{is well known for}} her style. She also loves fashion, and designs her own clothing. She has friends and a loving family, and she goes to public school. However, on various occasions, she gets [...] "psychic visions" [...] about what may or may not happen later. She is only able to [...] "see" [...] a small segment of some future event, and she frequently errs on what it really means, in which case her attempts to change these events only end up making it happen or making it worse. Her main catchphrases are [...] "Oh Fudge!", [...] "Oh snap!", [...] "Ya nasty!", [...] "How y'all doin'?", and [...] "Oh, no he didn't!" [...] She abruptly says, [...] "I'm okay!" [...] if she falls down in one of her disguises. And, if big guys throw her, she tells <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> [...] "gently!" [...] In addition, when she disapproves of something, she exclaims [...] "Gotta go!" [...] When she makes an appearance on Cory in the House, her father exclaims, [...] "You didn't get kicked out of design school because they don't give out refunds!", which shows she is attending design school. Raven is also a master of disguise, which fits in with her trouble-making antics and passion for becoming a fashion designer, like her idol, Donna Cabonna, whom she worked for as an intern. Raven Baxter is extremely allergic to mushrooms, and her favorite drink is orange juice. According to Chelsea, her favorite gemstone is diamond, her favorite vegetable is corn, and her favorite animal is stuffed. Often referred to as Rae, Raven does not enjoy nature or camping. She has appeared in every episode of the series, along with her younger brother Cory. In the second spin-off, Raven's Home, Raven eventually married her first love Devon but they got divorced. In between that time, they had two children Nia and Booker - latter of whom, shares Raven's ability to see into the future.|$|E
