Bandura (1986) says <b>that</b> <b>self-efficacy</b> {{and success}} of FGCS may be [...] "learned" [...] by watching their peers fail in college.

Gibbons and Borders (2010) highlight that while FGCS may overcome many obstacles, they still have the notion that they are not as successful as they should have been. Regardless, SCCT predicts that if a FGCS has strong family support, {{they are more likely to}} believe in their personal goals and path to higher education and stronger sense of self-efficacy.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the factors}} most {{commonly}} associated with self-efficacy in writing studies is motivation. Motivation is often divided into two categories: extrinsic and intrinsic. McLeod suggests that intrinsic motivators {{tend to be more}} effective than extrinsic motivators because students then perceive the given task as inherently valuable. Additionally, McCarthy, Meier, and Rinderer explain that writers who are intrinsically motivated tend to be more self-directed, take active control of their writing, and see themselves as more capable of setting and accomplishing goals. Furthermore, writing studies research indicates <b>that</b> <b>self-efficacy</b> influences student choices, effort, persistence, perseverance, thought patterns, and emotional reactions when completing a writing assignment. Students with a high self-efficacy are more likely to attempt and persist in unfamiliar writing tasks.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the direction and time-frame of relationships between perceived self-efficacy in classroom management and the three dimensions of burnout among 243 secondary school teachers.

However, the direction was reversed {{for the relationship between}} perceived self-efficacy and emotional exhaustion; the time frame was synchronous.

On the other hand, the result might also reflect some usability issues. The GPS MCL system might not be very user-friendly so that participants’ confidence decreased after using the system.|$|R
50|$|In 1963, he {{published}} Social Learning and Personality Development. In 1974, Stanford University awarded him an endowed chair {{and he became}} David Starr Jordan Professor of Social Science in Psychology. In 1977, {{he published}} Social Learning Theory, a book that altered the direction psychology took in the 1980s. While investigating the processes by which modeling alleviates phobic disorders in snake-phobics, he found <b>that</b> <b>self-efficacy</b> beliefs (which the phobic individuals had in their own capabilities to alleviate their phobia) mediated changes in behavior and in fear-arousal. He launched a major program of research examining the influential role of self-referent thought in psychological functioning. Although he continued to explore and write on theoretical problems relating to myriad topics, from the late 1970s he devoted much attention to exploring the role of self-efficacy beliefs in human functioning.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to attitudes and subjective norms (which make {{the theory of}} reasoned action), the theory of planned behavior adds the concept of perceived behavioral control, which originates from self-efficacy theory (SET). Self-efficacy was proposed by Bandura in 1977, which came from social cognitive theory. According to Bandura, expectations such as motivation, performance, and feelings of frustration associated with repeated failures determine effect and behavioral reactions. Bandura separated expectations into two distinct types: self-efficacy and outcome expectancy. He defined self-efficacy as the conviction that one can successfully execute the behavior required to produce the outcomes. The outcome expectancy refers to a person's estimation that a given behavior will lead to certain outcomes. He states <b>that</b> <b>self-efficacy</b> {{is the most important}} precondition for behavioral change, since it determines the initiation of coping behavior. Previous investigations have shown that peoples' behavior is strongly influenced by their {{confidence in their ability to}} perform that behavior. As the self-efficacy theory contributes to explaining various relationships between beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behavior, the SET has been widely applied to health-related fields such as physical activity and mental health in preadolescents, and exercise.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{the first}} {{suggestion}} to consider self-efficacy as {{a theoretical framework}} to explain how especially novices adjust to the workplace was by Fletcher, who argued <b>that</b> <b>self-efficacy</b> may help differentiate students {{making the transition from}} pupil to practitioner. Specifically, Fletcher suggested that workplace experiences can increase self-efficacy through performance accomplishments, one source of efficacy information. Successful experiences can result in a feedback loop where performance accomplishments lead to increased self-efficacy, which, in turn, enhances a person’s performance, further strengthening self-efficacy beliefs. [...] Numerous research studies have refined and elaborated on the application of self-efficacy theory to career development and workplace learning. There was nevertheless the task of assembling its constituents. Evidence from the value of cooperative education programs have long suggested that any persistent advantages accruing to participants in these programs are more tied to the non-technical than the technical skills they afford. By non-technical, work training administrators focus on the social skills or what is also referred to as the “soft” skills rather than the hard, subject-matter skills. In turn, authors reference social skills as human relations aptitudes considered critical in interpersonal communication. [...] The soft skills focus as well on communication competencies, especially empathy and sensitivity, and competencies involving interacting with others, such as teamworking and giving and receiving feedback.|$|E

30|$|Bandura [8, 9] noted <b>that</b> <b>self-efficacy</b> can be {{predictive}} of an individual’s motivation, affect, and behavior. In addition, {{studies have found}} <b>that</b> <b>self-efficacy</b> is a strong predictor of students’ course selections and career choices [6, 13]. Self-efficacy is a central concept {{to the development of}} students’ academic motivation [6, 10]. Students with high self-efficacy for a task have {{confidence in their ability to}} perform the task effectively. In contrast, low self-efficacy is marked by a lack of confidence in one’s abilities to succeed at a given task or domain [40, 41].|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{despite the}} fact <b>that</b> the <b>self-efficacy</b> scale was dichotomized which {{may have led to}} reduced power, we found a strong {{association}} between sports participation and exercise self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is a well-known behavioural determinant of physical activity [53] assuming <b>that</b> exercise <b>self-efficacy</b> influences physical activity. In the current study, we hypothesised another causal pathway, i.e. that sports participation would result in beneficial scores on a range of psychosocial health indicators, including exercise self-efficacy. Sources of influence of self-efficacy are vicarious experiences or modelling and past experiences [46]; therefore, it can be expected that those who participate in sports see others performing sports, and also experience themselves that they are able to perform sports, which both positively impact on their exercise self-efficacy.|$|R

30|$|Our study {{raises the}} question: why, {{contrary}} to expectations, does self-efficacy {{not have a}} direct effect on PPSDM? A possible explanation might be <b>that</b> <b>self-efficacy</b> could generate in the patient an exaggerated feeling {{of his or her}} own ability. The patients may feel independent enough to take the decision themselves, so they do not perceive the decision to be shared. However, the results obtained show <b>that</b> <b>self-efficacy</b> has an indirect and significative effect on PPSDM through proactive behaviour. Thus, self-efficacy is also a crucial factor when trying to elicit in the patient the feeling that he/she is participating in the decision-making.|$|E
