5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is {{surprised}} {{that men have}} been noticing her, instead of resenting or ignoring her as <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do.</b> Her friend Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells Liz that she is coming off as more confident since starting {{her relationship with her}} boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon). Liz decides to use her new-found confidence to help TGS with Tracy Jordan producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) with a problem he has had with a difficult television editor named Ritchie (Paul Giamatti). Liz visits him in the editing room and hopes to convince him to get TGSs show's opener footage finished as soon as possible in which she is successful after flirting with Ritchie. Later, Liz learns that Ritchie is spreading a rumor that the two are sleeping together. She confronts Ritchie about it, he admits to starting the rumor {{in order to get the}} attention of his assistant editor Donna (Joanna Adler). Later, Liz and Ritchie have a pretend break-up in front of Donna, and Donna becomes interested in Ritchie.|$|E

25|$|Transliterations usually {{avoid the}} typographically complex marks {{that are used}} in Tiberian vocalization. They also attempt to {{indicate}} vowels and syllables more explicitly than Tiberian vocalization does. Therefore a technical transliteration requires the use of Tiberian principles, as mentioned below, rather than simply representing the Tiberian symbols. Many transliteration standards require a thorough knowledge of these principles, yet <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do</b> not provide practical details.|$|E

50|$|During {{the decades}} of the 1920s and 1930s a second {{immigrant}} group arrived to Argentina, where they develop their professional careers in the biggest cities of the country, working as teachers, journalists, actors and politicians. The districts where the most Jews established where Villa Crespo, Balvanera, Flores, Barracas, La Boca and suburban areas. As <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> <b>did,</b> Jewish people organized their social activities founding their own institutions such as temples, cemeteries, hospitals, committees and clubs.|$|R
25|$|A. ocellaris feed on {{plankton}} and algae, {{thus they}} are considered omnivores. Feeding is also affected by the hierarchy in A. ocellaris groups. Since the smaller, less dominant fish face aggression from the more aggressive fish, they have less energy to forage for food. Thus, <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do</b> not eat {{as much as the}} dominant fish do, because of reduced energy, but also because of the increased danger they face when they leave their anemone since they are smaller. In other words, the larger fish will usually travel farther than the smaller fish. Generally, the A. ocellaris feed on algae, copepods, and zooplankton.|$|E
25|$|If any {{of these}} rules is violated, an umpire will call the {{delivery}} a no ball. Additionally a player may not make any significant movement after the ball comes into play and before the ball reaches the striker. If this happens, an umpire will call and signal 'dead ball'. For close fielders anything other than minor adjustments to stance or position {{in relation to the}} striker is significant. In the outfield, fielders may move in towards the striker or striker's wicket; indeed, <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do.</b> However, anything other than slight movement off line or away from the striker is to be considered significant.|$|E
25|$|Stelas. These are large, {{elongated}} stone slabs usually {{covered with}} carvings and inscriptions, and {{often accompanied by}} round altars. Typical of the Classical period, most of them depict the rulers of the cities they were located in, often disguised as gods. Although the rulers' faces, particularly during the later Classic Period, are naturalistic in style, <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do</b> not show individual traits; but there are notable exceptions to this rule (e.g., Piedras Negras, stela 35). The most famous stelas are from Copan and nearby Quirigua. These are outstanding for their intricateness of detail, those of Quirigua also for sheer height (stela E measuring over 7 metres above ground level and 3 below). Both the Copan and Tonina stelas approach sculptures in the round. From Palenque, otherwise a true Maya capital of the arts, no significant stelae have been preserved.|$|E

25|$|Older offspring, {{which are}} around two years old, may also live in {{families}} and help their parents. In addition to helping build food caches and repairing the dam, two-year-olds {{will also help}} in feeding, grooming and guarding younger offspring. Beavers also practice alloparental care, in which an older sibling may take over the parenting duties if the original parents die or are otherwise separated from them. This behavior is common and is seen in many other animal species, such as the elephant and fathead minnow. While these helping two-year-olds help increase the chance of survival for younger offspring, they are not essential for the family, and two-year-olds only stay and help their families {{if there is a}} shortage of resources in times of food shortage, high population density, or drought. When beavers leave their natal territories, <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do</b> not settle far. Beavers can recognize their kin by detecting differences in anal gland secretion composition using their keen sense of smell. Related beavers share more features in their anal gland secretion profile than unrelated beavers. Being able to recognize kin is important for beaver social behavior, and it causes more tolerant behavior among neighboring beavers.|$|E
25|$|Many changes {{brought about}} by the {{domestication}} of the horse have led to a need for shoes for numerous reasons, mostly linked to management that results in horses' hooves hardening less and being more vulnerable to injury. In the wild, a horse may travel up to 50 miles per day to obtain adequate forage. While horses in the wild cover large areas of terrain, <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do</b> so at relatively slow speeds, unless being chased by a predator. They also tend to live in arid steppe climates. The consequence of slow but nonstop travel in a dry climate is that horses' feet are naturally worn to a small, smooth, even and hard state. The continual stimulation of the sole of the foot keeps it thick and hard. However, in domestication, the ways horses are used differ from what they would encounter in their natural environment. Domesticated horses are brought to colder and wetter areas than their ancestral habitat. These softer and heavier soils soften the hooves and make them prone to splitting, making hoof protection necessary. Consequently, it was in northern Europe that the nailed horseshoe arose in its modern form.|$|E
25|$|Sand {{filters are}} a {{variation}} of the infiltration trench principle and operate in a way similar to bioretention systems. Stormwater is passed through them for treatment prior to discharge to the downstream stormwater system. Sand filters are very useful in treating runoff from confined hard surfaces such as car parks and from heavily urbanised and built-up areas. <b>They</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do</b> not support vegetation owing to the filtration media (sand) not retaining sufficient moisture and because they are usually installed underground. The filter usually consists of a sedimentation chamber as pre-treatment device to remove litter, debris, gross pollutants and medium-sized sediments; a weir; followed by a sand layer that filters sediments, finer particulates and dissolved pollutants. The filtered water is collected by perforated underdrain pipes in a similar manner as in bioretention systems. Systems may also have an overflow chamber. The sedimentation chamber can have permanent water or can be designed to be drained with weep holes between storm events. Permanent water storage however, can risk anaerobic conditions that can lead to the release of pollutants (e.g. phosphorus). The design process should consider the provision of detention storage to yield a high hydrologic effectiveness, and discharge control by proper sizing of the perforated underdrain and overflow path. Regular maintenance is required to prevent crust forming.|$|E
5000|$|Until the {{promotion}} of Dogen studies in modern times, the study of Chinese texts was prevalent in Soto: After textual learning was revived during the early Tokugawa period, most Japanese Sōtō monks still studied only well-known Chinese Buddhist scriptures or classic Chinese Zen texts. Eventually a few scholarly monks like Menzan Zuihō began to study Dōgen's writings, but they were the exceptions. Even when scholarly monks read Dōgen's writings, <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> <b>did</b> not lecture on them to their disciples.|$|R

50|$|Although {{extended}} families farmed the land, <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> <b>did</b> not own it. They {{were allowed to}} use it by the calpulli to which they belonged. Calpulli were groups of families that controlled {{the use of the}} land and performed other territorial functions, as well as social ones. The majority of calpulli had a telpuchcalli, a school for young men. Another function of the calpulli was a taxation unit. The empire collected taxes from each calpulli, which in turn collected taxes from its member families.|$|R
25|$|The steppe wildcat's coat {{is lighter}} than the forest wildcat's, and never attains the level of density, length, or {{luxuriance}} {{as that of the}} forest wildcat, even in winter. The tail appears much thinner than that of the forest wildcat, as the hairs there are much shorter, and more close-fitting. The colours and patterns of the steppe wildcat vary greatly, though the general background colour of the skin on the body's upper surface is very lightly coloured. The hairs along the spine are usually darker, forming a dark gray, brownish, or ochreous band. Small and rounded spots cover the entirety of the species' upper body. These spots are solid and sharply defined, and do not occur in clusters or appear in rosette patterns. <b>They</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do</b> not form transverse rows or transverse stripes on the trunk, {{as is the case in}} the forest wildcat. Only on the thighs are distinct striping patterns visible. The underside is mainly white, with a light gray, creamy or pale yellow tinge. The spots on the chest and abdomen are much larger and more blurred than on the back. The lower neck, throat, neck, and the region between the forelegs are devoid of spots, or have bear them only distinctly. The tail is mostly the same colour as the back, with the addition of a dark and narrow stripe along the upper two-thirds of the tail. The tip of the tail is black, with 2–5 black transverse rings above it. The upper lips and eyelids are light, pale yellow-white. The facial region is of an intense gray colour, while the top of the head is covered with a dark gray coat. In some specimens, the forehead is covered in dense clusters of brown spots. A narrow, dark brown stripe extends from the corner of the eye to the base of the ear.|$|E
500|$|... "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé Knowles, Solange Knowles, Angie Beyincé and {{produced}} as well as co-written by The Bama Boyz. Jonathan Wells of Bama Boyz said that they decided to try something different from what <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do,</b> by mixing several genres for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me". The song's inspiration came {{from the time they}} spent in London at the end of Beyoncé Knowles' The Beyoncé Experience tour in promotion of her second studio album B'Day (2006). The writing and production of the song began in London and was finished stateside in early 2008. They admitted that the song's structure was unusual, however they were happy that it ended up in the Knowles' hands. After The Bama Boyz produced two tracks on Solange Knowles' second studio album Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams (2008), she asked them to put instrumentals together for her to write for her sister Beyoncé.|$|E

He is the inventor of, among other things, a frog exaggerator (which grossly misrepresents the size of amphibians), automatic tapping shoes for tap dancing, the sarcasm detector, hamburger earmuffs, the 8-month-after pill, and a drilling machine that can cut through anything. Some of Frink's unsuccessful inventions include his small remote-controlled plane that carries babies as passengers (it crashed), and a burglar-proof house that sprouts legs and runs away from potential danger (the legs of which collapsed causing the house to crash {{to the ground and}} catch fire). As a scientist, Frink has discovered and cured [...] "Frink's Disease" [...] and discovered the element [...] "Frinkonium".

50|$|A {{special case}} {{is that of the}} debtor who sells himself as a slave to his creditor; the Holiness Code instructs that in this situation, the debtor must not be made to do the work of slaves, but must instead be treated the same as a hired servant. In Jewish tradition, this was taken to mean that the debtor should not be {{instructed}} to do humiliating work - which only slaves would do - and that the debtor should be asked to perform the craft(s) which <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> <b>did</b> before <b>they</b> had been enslaved, if it is realistic to do so.|$|R
2500|$|Forager wasps use venom and {{stinging}} {{to subdue}} caterpillars that they bring {{back to the}} nest for consumption. The wasps sting the caterpillars multiple times and then wait until their prey is paralyzed enough to approach. Then the wasp must bite its prey into chunks in order to carry {{it back to the}} nest. The larvae prey lose muscular control, become paralyzed, and then the wasp grasps the caterpillar in its mandibles and chews it into packets of meat. Venom is used to paralyze prey but is also used to deter nest predators. Since it is hard for wasps to subdue prey that are similar in size, the wasp may get hurt and maybe even tear its wing in the attack. Most wasp species do not use stinging to subdue prey like Parachartergus fraternus does. Usually, they use physical means, and use stinging as more of a defensive tactic. Therefore, Parachartergus fraternus can probably attack a more diverse set of prey, in terms of both prey size and type, due to their frequent use of paralyzing stings [...] Birds also sometimes agitate these wasps, but <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do</b> not attack because they are not a very aggressive species.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main event}} was another chapter in an on-again, off-again storyline between Atlantis and Último Guerrero that had {{started in the}} fall of 2011 when Atlantis left Último Guerrero's Los Guerreros del Infierno group. On this night Atlantis was {{accompanied}} by the tecnico [...] "Mascot" [...] Ke Monito, a little person wearing a furry blue monkey suite that accompanies a lot of the CMLL tecnicos to the ring. The building rivalry was immediately expressed by both competitors working a more aggressive style of match than <b>they</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do,</b> including repeated attempts by Último Guerrero to unmask his opponent, which in Lucha Libre is the ultimate dirty trick to use. Atlantis won the first fall of the match, causing Último Guerrero to retaliate, not just by trying to pull Atlantis' mask off, but by actually tearing it apart in places. Guerrero managed to win the second fall as he used the ropes for illegal leverage during the pin-fall, making sure to hide it from the referee. The third fall was the longest of the match and saw Atlantis retaliate by starting to tear Último Guerrero's mask apart too, using some of the same rudo tricks as his opponent. In the end Atlantis got the third and final fall, winning the match by using the ropes himself, mirroring the actions of Último Guerrero in the second fall. After the match Atlantis made a public challenge to Guerrero and his tag team partner Dragón Rojo, Jr. to defend the CMLL World Tag Team Championship against Atlantis and a partner of his choice, but Guerrero did not respond to the challenge.|$|E
