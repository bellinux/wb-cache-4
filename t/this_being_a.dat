The idea with the recycling plant was that Burns did not have any sort of evil plan, he just could not help being himself.

Burns was drawn without his trademark scowl for this episode.

5|$|Wright met Darwin in {{the early}} 1760s, {{probably}} through their common connection of John Whitehurst, first consulting Darwin about ill health in 1767 when {{he stayed in the}} Darwin household for a week. The energy and vivacity of both Erasmus and Mary (Polly) Darwin impressed Wright. In the 1980s Eric Evans (National Gallery) suggested that Darwin is the figure in the left foreground who holds a watch. As this composed timekeeper is not consistent with Darwin's flamboyant character, {{it is more likely that}} this is Dr William Small. The attention to timekeeping fits with Dr Small's role as the social secretary for the Lunar circle. Small returned from Virginia in 1764 and established his practice in Birmingham in 1765, consistent with <b>this</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> meeting in 1767. The profile and wig of this figure are consistent with a contemporary portrait of Small by Tilly Kettle.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Jeff Jarrett defended against the {{challenger}} Rhino. The duration of the match was 17 minutes and 30 seconds. Jarrett was busted open during the contest. Despite <b>this</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> standard wrestling match, Jarrett and Rhino used weapons throughout and primarily fought outside of the ring. Jarrett hit Rhino with a chair while the two stood on a scaffolding, causing Rhino to fall off and crash through a table. Rhino attempted to tackle Jarrett through a table {{set up on the}} entrance ramp. He succeeded, but the table did not break. Team Canada interfered afterwards, trying to stop Rhino from getting to the ring before the referee counted both Rhino and Jarrett out. They failed as Rhino came rushing back into the ring before the count finished. Jarrett pinned Rhino after slamming Rhino face-first with his signature Stroke maneuver onto several steel chairs. As such, Jarrett retained the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. After the title match, the lights went off with the logo of the wrestler Sting appearing on the screens in the arena, thus being the major announcement advertised for the show.|$|E

The marriage was childless and the Duke died on 15 September 1435 at Rouen. As was customary at the time, after her second marriage Jacquetta retained the title of her first husband and was always known as the Duchess of Bedford, <b>this</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> higher title than that of countess.

His stories were also published in summer and Christmas annuals. The short, short stories tend to rely for effect on the audience's expectation being trumped by a clever twist at the end. Although the short stories are long out of print, one by Will Scott was reprinted in 1992, in The Folio Anthology of Humour, <b>this</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> reprint of a P.G.

25|$|There {{are serious}} and {{controversial}} issues about {{differences in the}} situation of women with different races and ethnicities in Brazil. As a whole, black and Amerindian women enjoy considerably less quality of life than white women, with <b>this</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> reflection of the general characteristics {{of the social and}} economic gap that has separated social classes in Brazil for centuries, thus not indicating any specific problem about gender and women's rights. Black women's life expectancy in 2004 was 69.52 years, while white women could expect to live 73.80 on average. However, there is, at least apparently, no legal or institutional circumstance that generates those ethnic differences, but lower standards of life have always been related to a much larger percentage of mulatto, black and Amerindian people in Brazil, as in many other countries. In the last years, there is a tendency of soft decrease in Brazil's racial inequality.|$|E
25|$|Spirals {{or plastic}} {{ornament}} {{which is similar}} to Grooved Ware is found on the Aberdeenshire examples, <b>this</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> type of late Neolithic pottery not known in the north-east but common in Orkney and Fife. The New Grange carvings in Ireland show strong similarities to those found on some balls. A continuous spiral is found on one and elements of chevrons, zig-zags and concentric triangles are also found, stimulating comparisons with petrosomatoglyph symbolism. Mostly the different knobs have different or sometimes no ornamentation. A 'golf-ball' variety of ornamentation is found on a few balls. The carving {{does not appear to have}} any practical purpose in general, however it has been suggested that one type, with very distinct knobs, was used for processing copper ores (see under 'Function'). Some of the bold triangles and criss-cross incisions seem to be more Iron Age in character than Neolithic or Bronze Age.|$|E

25|$|On September 4, 2008, Direct Air {{announced}} they would begin service to Worcester beginning in November 2008, with flights from Orlando/Sanford, FL and Fort Myers/Punta Gorda, FL. The flights were initially operated by Virgin America using Airbus A320 aircraft, however Direct Air {{was forced to}} return the aircraft in June 2009 to suffice Virgin's rapidly expanding domestic routes. Following this Direct Air began carrying out flights on Boeing 737-400's owned by Xtra Airways. Due to <b>this</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> wet-lease agreement, there were times where the aircraft was unavailable and other aircraft had to be chartered for the flights. Such examples include an Airbus A320 from USA 3000 and a Boeing 757 from North American Airlines. In March 2009, Direct Air added additional flights to Myrtle Beach, SC. In July 2010, Direct Air expanded their Worcester service further to West Palm Beach, FL. The airline had further plans to launch flights to San Juan, Puerto Rico and Nassau, Bahamas but in March 2012 Direct Air suspended all operations and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on April 12, 2012.|$|E
25|$|Epidemics of FMD have {{resulted}} in the slaughter of millions of animals, despite <b>this</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> frequently nonfatal disease for adult animals (2–5% mortality), though young animals can have a high mortality. The Taiwan outbreak that only affected pigs also showed a high mortality for adults. The destruction of animals is primarily to halt further spread, as growth and milk production may be permanently affected, even in animals that have recovered. Due to international efforts to eradicate the disease, infection would also lead to trade bans being imposed on affected countries. Critics of current policies to cull infected herds argue that the financial imperative needs to be balanced against the killing of many animals, especially when a significant proportion of infected animals, most notably those producing milk, would recover from infection and live normal lives, albeit with reduced milk production. On the ethical side, one must also consider FMD is a painful disease for the affected animals. The vesicles/blisters are painful in themselves, and restrict both eating and movement. Through ruptured blisters, the animal is at risk from secondary bacterial infections and, in some cases, permanent disability.|$|E

Punggol East SMC saw the only three-cornered fight in the 2011 elections, with Michael Palmer from the People's Action Party (PAP), Desmond Lim from the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA), and Lee Li Lian from the Workers' Party (WP) contesting.

Despite <b>this</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> four-way fight, WP's Lee emerged victorious with 54.52% of valid votes cast, shocking many {{on both sides of the}} political divide, who expected it to be a close fight. PAP's Koh came in second with 43.71% of the votes, with the RP and SDA candidates losing their electoral deposits with less than 2% of the votes combined.
