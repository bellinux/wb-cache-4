5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum <b>that</b> <b>if</b> something is impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) {{that it is the}} case. It follows <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we have a perception that p, then even though it might not be the case that p, it is at least the case that possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, it follows that the existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E

40|$|Intermediate {{filaments}} (IFs) impart {{mechanical integrity}} to cells, yet IF mechanics are poorly understood. It is assumed <b>that</b> <b>IFs</b> in cells are as stiff as hard α-keratin, F-actin, and microtubules, {{but the high}} bending flexibility of IFs and the low stiffness of soft α-keratins suggest <b>that</b> hydrated <b>IFs</b> may be quite soft. To test this hypothesis, we measured the tensile mechanics of the keratin-like threads from hagfish slime, which are an ideal model for exploring the mechanics of IF bundles and IFs because they consist of tightly packed and aligned IFs. Tensile tests suggest <b>that</b> hydrated <b>IF</b> bundles possess low initial stiffness (Ei = 6. 4 MPa) and remarkable elasticity (up to strains of 0. 34), which we attribute to soft elastomeric IF protein terminal domains in series with stiffer coiled coils. The high tensile strength (180 MPa) and toughness (130 MJ/m 3) of IF bundles support the notion <b>that</b> <b>IFs</b> lend mechanical integrity to cells. Their long-range elasticity suggests <b>that</b> <b>IFs</b> may also allow cells to recover from large deformations. X-ray diffraction and congo-red staining indicate that post-yield deformation leads to an irreversible α→β conformational transition in IFs, which leads to plastic deformation, and may be used by cells as a mechanosensory cue...|$|R

40|$|The major {{purposes}} of this study were to: (1) clearly identify intermediate filaments (IFs) and elucidate their structural arrangement at the myofibrillar Z-lines in non-diseased, mature mammalian striated muscle cells, and (2) determine the localization of constituent proteins of the IFs by immunogold localization. IFs running transversely to the long axis of the cell and connecting Z-lines of adjacent myofibrils were identified by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of plastic-embedded porcine semitendinosus muscle, especially in areas of cells where myofibrils were less tightly packed. When the plane of section included the periphery of myofibrils at their Z-lines, examination indicated <b>that</b> <b>IFs</b> surround, rather than significantly penetrate, myofibrils. IFs also were identified that connect myofibrils (especially at their Z-lines) to nuclei, mitochondria, and the sarcolemma;In order to examine the three-dimensional structural relationship of IFs and myofibrils, micrographs were taken after tilting the specimen to obtain stereo pairs. The results suggest <b>that</b> <b>IFs</b> primarily surround myofibrils at their Z-lines and <b>that</b> a few <b>IFs</b> are arranged in a longitudinal fashion along the periphery of the myofibrils;Results from TEM-immunogold labeling studies indicate that desmin is located primarily at the periphery of Z-lines and nearby I-band regions in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. A lower level of desmin labeling was observed along the periphery of the long axis of the myofibrils, which suggested the presence of some longitudinal IFs. The immunogold labeling pattern observed with anti-synemin was very similar to that obtained with anti-desmin. However, the intensity of the synemin labeling was generally lower than that observed with anti-desmin. Intense labeling with anti-desmin was observed in some areas near the sarcolemma and nuclei in samples examined after pre-embedding labeling. The linear pattern of the labeling suggests <b>that</b> <b>IFs</b> attach myofibrils to those membranous structures;These results support a cytoskeletal concept <b>that</b> <b>IFs</b> link adjacent myofibrils together at their Z-lines, and myofibrils to membranous structures. The IFs are attached to myofibrils primarily in a lateral rather than end-on fashion. The IFs identified by TEM contain desmin. Synemin is either part of, or attached to, desmin IFs...|$|R
