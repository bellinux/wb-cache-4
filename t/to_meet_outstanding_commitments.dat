The pressure on the OTU was such that it offered little more than a conversion programme for pilots and crews hoping to man land-based aircraft. In 1940, Bomber Command was asked to support Coastal forces, even though at that time in the war it overstretched itself. Requests to the Air Ministry <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>outstanding</b> OTU requirements were largely ignored. The single landplane OTU was established to train 1.1 crews per month.

Later, pop came in, as did other technical composition techniques of the avant-garde in music of the 20th century, although he retained an ironical distance from some of them, subjecting them on occasions to irony or parody.The origin of part of Papandopulo’s oeuvre of the 1960s and 1970s is related to his guest appearances and acquaintanceships with musicians in the then divided Germany (BNR and DDR), where he had opportunities <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>outstanding</b> artistic personalities, as well as recent European musical creation.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{methodology}} for generating sovereign credit ratings.

The debt limit can be either ad hoc or based on the financial ability of a government to change fiscal policy in the future <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> its <b>outstanding</b> obligations. When applied to quarterly U. S. data from 1970 to 2011, two clear instances are found in which the U.

40|$|In {{advanced}} electrical grids of the future, electrochemically rechargeable fluids of {{high energy}} density will capture the power generated from intermittent sources like solar and wind. <b>To</b> <b>meet</b> this <b>outstanding</b> technological demand {{there is a need}} to understand the fundamental limits and interplay of electrochemical potential, stability, and solubility in low-weight redox-active molecules. By generating a combinatorial set of 1, 4 -dimethoxybenzene derivatives with different arrangements of substituents, we discovered a minimalistic structure that combines exceptional long-term stability in its oxidized form and a record-breaking intrinsic capacity of 161 [*]mAh/g. The nonaqueous redox flow battery has been demonstrated that uses this molecule as a catholyte material and operated stably for 100 charge/discharge cycles. The observed stability trends are rationalized by mechanistic considerations of the reaction pathways. United States. Dept. of Energy. Office of Basic Energy Sciences.

40|$|Despite Double skin façade (DSF) {{buildings}} are widely deployed worldwide, daylighting strategy is not commonly incorporated in these buildings compare to other strategies. Therefore, further theoretical and experimental studies {{would lead to}} adopting daylighting strategy in DSF office buildings. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the daylighting performance of office building at different design parameters of box window DSF using different glazing types under sub interval of intermediate sky conditions (20 - 40) klux using the (IES VE) simulation tool from Integrated Environmental Solutions - Virtual Environment. The implemented design parameters are window wall ratio (WWR) of internal façade (10 - 100) %, cavity depth (CD) of DSF (1 - 2. 5) m and different glazing types. The glazing types were selected from the list available in the (IES VE) simulation tool. After series of evaluations, bronze tinted coating (STOPSOL) is implemented for the exterior façade while clear float, clear reflective coating (STOPSOL), grey and brown tinted coating (Anti-sun float) and blue coating tinted (SUNCOOL float) are implemented for the interior façade. In this paper, several evaluation parameters are used to quantify the optimum design parameters that would balance the daylighting requirements of a box window DSF office versus sky conditions range (20 - 40) klux. The optimum design parameters of DSF office building obtained under different glazing types are highlighted as follows. When using bronze tinted coating (STOPSOL) for the exterior façade, the glazing types of interior façade that showed superior daylighting performance of DSF office at (CD of 1. 0 m with WWR of 70 %), (CD of 1. 5 m with WWR of 70 %), (CD of 2. 0 m with WWR of 70 %) and (CD of 2. 0 m with WWR of 70 %) are grey tinted coating (Anti-sun float), clear reflective coating (STOPSOL), brown tinted coating (Anti-sun float), and clear float glazing respectively. Blue Coating tinted (SUNCOOL float) of interior façade glazing failed <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>outstanding</b> daylighting performance at any cavity depth...|$|R

30|$|In each interim or annual {{financial}} statement, FAS 159 requires {{firms to}} disclose their reasons for electing the fair value option for each item. Firms also need to disclose which balance sheet items contain liabilities for which the FVOL has been elected. FAS 159 further requires firms to disclose gains and losses from fair value changes for each income statement line item included in earnings. Generally, gains and losses from changes in fair values for which the FVOL has been elected {{do not need to}} be disclosed separately from other fair value changes in the same line item. As an exception, firms need to separately disclose gains and losses from fair value changes that are attributable to changes in firms’ own credit risk. For example, if a firm’s ability <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> its <b>outstanding</b> debt decreases, the market value of its issued debt decreases simultaneously. On the other hand, if markets assume that a firm’s solvency improved, its liabilities’ market values increase. Such value changes are called DVAs—debt valuation adjustments due to a change in own credit risk.|$|R
