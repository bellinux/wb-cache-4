5|$|In 2015, a modernized {{version of}} Thumbelina {{appears in the}} Disney Junior series, Goldie and Bear. In the episode Thumbelina's Wild Ride, Thumbelina (voiced by Debby Ryan with her singing voice {{provided}} by Shannon Chan-Kent) is hired to babysit for Goldie and Bear. The two friends are initially put off by her small stature, thinking she's almost helpless. When she tries getting the kids a snack, she falls down the kitchen sink and slides into the river behind the house. Goldie and Bear try to save her, but soon see that Thumbelina is resourceful, agile, and can lift several times her own weight. She saves herself from the river and even rescues the kids when they fall in trying to save her. The kids take an instant liking to Thumbellina and can't wait for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> babysits.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to prepare her {{daughter}} Bernice, then only five years old, for the funeral, she {{tried to explain to}} her that <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> saw her father he would be in a casket and would not be speaking. When asked by her son Dexter when his father would return, King lied and told him that his father had only been badly hurt. Senator Robert Kennedy ordered three more telephones to be installed in the King residence for King and her family to be able to answer the flood of calls they received and offered a plane to transport her to Memphis. Coretta spoke to Kennedy the day after the assassination and asked if he could persuade Jacqueline Kennedy to attend her husband's funeral with him.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} episode of the series, [...] "The Eleventh Hour", Prisoner Zero tells the Doctor, [...] "The {{universe}} is cracked. The Pandorica will open. Silence will fall". The Pandorica was also mentioned by River in [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] as <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> would meet him, and the Doctor dismissed the Pandorica as a fairy tale. In River's timeline this takes place before [...] "The Time of Angels"/"Flesh and Stone". The painting of the TARDIS explosion passes through several characters from previous episodes: the painting is created by Vincent Van Gogh (Tony Curran) after his meeting with the Doctor ("Vincent and the Doctor"). The painting is found in 1941 by Winston Churchill (Ian McNeice) and Professor Bracewell (Bill Paterson) from [...] "Victory of the Daleks", and River steals the painting from Liz 10 (Sophie Okonedo), who previously appeared in [...] "The Beast Below". The recurring phrase [...] "silence will fall" [...] {{came to a head}} in the next series with the introduction of the alien species and organisation of the Silence. The message on Planet One, [...] "ΘΣ Φ ΓΥΔϟ," [...] starts with [...] "Theta Sigma (ΘΣ)," [...] which was The Doctor's [...] "nickname" [...] in his academy days.|$|E
50|$|This quote {{shows that}} Ellen's {{movement}} from family to family really took {{a toll on}} her. She {{does not want to}} accumulate possessions because she knows she won't be able to take them with her <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she's</b> forced to move.|$|R
50|$|Joey Perrone {{decides to}} stay with Stranahan on the island. Corbett has taken an {{interest}} in Ricca, and invites her to share some time on his farm in New Zealand. Rolvaag finally closes the case and moves back to his native Minnesota. Before he goes, Rose tells him her mother lives in Minnetonka and coquettishly invites him to lunch <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she’s</b> in town.|$|R
5000|$|The {{revelation is}} not that Amy Ryan is good. It’s that she’s this good ... Ryan, whose range has been {{apparent}} for years, in dramatic performances nominated for Tonys (Uncle Vanya) and Oscars (Gone Baby Gone), {{as well as in}} nuanced comic turns on television shows like The Office, manages a feat in Love, Love, Love that she’s never accomplished so fluidly before: taking charge. She delivers a front-and-center performance of such beguiling dynamism (in a thoroughly convincing English accent) that you feel this Roundabout Theatre Company production has done for her precisely what was intended. It exposes a new facet of her talent — and leaves us with that uplifting itch, to be there <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she’s</b> on a stage.|$|R
500|$|The tunnel {{construction}} became unintentionally {{involved in}} the women's rights movement when Janet Bonnema applied for a position as an engineering technician with the Colorado Department of Transportation. She was given an assignment on the Straight Creek Tunnels project, but her supervisor misread her resume and thought he was hiring [...] "James". When the supervisor discovered the department had hired a woman, she was instead tasked with doing support work from the office. There was opposition to a woman entering the construction site: One supervisor stated that if she entered, [...] "Those workers would flat walk out of that there tunnel and they'd never come back". The workers, most of whom had a mining background, expressed a common superstition that a woman brought bad luck to a mine. One worker insisted, [...] "It's a jinx. I've seen too many die after a woman was in the tunnel." [...] Bonnema sued the department {{for the right to}} work inside the tunnel. She countered she was in better shape and more agile than most of the men working on the tunnel. Emboldened by the passage of an equal rights law in Colorado, she finally entered the tunnel, with an entourage of reporters, on November 9, 1972. Some workers did walk off the job; at least one yelled, [...] "Get those women out of here". She remained determined and re-entered the tunnel a few days later. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> dressed in coveralls, and was even assigned tasks {{on the roof of the}} tunnel overlooking the men below. Surprised that nobody apparently noticed she was a woman, she stated, [...] "I had a good disguise".|$|E
2500|$|Wallace Wimple (Thompson, using a {{voice he}} later {{employed}} for the MGM-animated Droopy) – Wimple was a soft-spoken {{man in the}} Caspar Milquetoast vein. He would enter the episode uttering his mush-mouth catchphrase, [...] "Hello, folks!" [...] Wimple might recite a verse he'd written but more often would recount the latest incident in his ongoing battle with Sweetie-Face, his [...] "big old wife” who had the physique and demeanor of a drill sergeant on a bad day. Sweetie-Face was a regular unseen character (actually of course, this being radio, unheard character), appearing in the show only from Wallace's perspective. “Wimp,” as Fibber called him, often reported provoking an overreaction from Sweetie-Face, followed by his attempt at revenge {{in a way that}} could be prankish, painful, or in some stories potentially fatal. One day (03/09/48) when he asked Sweetie-Face what she was doing, Wallace said she told him she was [...] "practicing her weight-lifting." [...] Wallace said he told Sweetie-Face, [...] "My goodness, you do that every time you get up out of a chair.” [...] “Uh oh,” fretted Molly. “And then when I regained consciousness,” continued Wimple, “she'd left the room.” With a typically evil chuckle, Wallace said that he got even by bolting her 200-pound barbell to the floor, causing her to strain so hard <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> lifted weights that she popped her girdle. Passive-aggressive behavior edging well over the line into domestic violence characterized Wimple's stories. Radio network censors in the 1940s blocked any reference to certain subjects including sex, but the dark humor about domestic violence that was allowed here and in The Honeymooners would likely not be written into a network-TV sitcom today. Though the term “wimp” as used to describe a weak-willed person predated Fibber McGee and Molly, the Wimple character and Fibber's nickname for him may have contributed to a surge in popular use.|$|E

6000|$|I {{bought two}} cows this afternoon. That trader at Nogi died of fever, [...] and I bought them from his partner, Sam Willis his name is, who agrees [...] to deliver them--most likely by <b>the</b> Minerva <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> is down [...] that way. Berande has been long enough on tinned milk.|$|R
60|$|Again she dove {{and with}} strong strokes headed for <b>the</b> shore. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> that <b>she</b> rose {{she was terrified}} to see the prahu looming close behind her. The paddlers were {{propelling}} the boat slowly in her direction--it was almost upon her now--there was a shout from {{a man in the}} bow--she had been seen.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> that <b>she</b> saw him he {{was without}} the stripes that had adorned his sleeve. He had been broken {{to the level of}} private for his {{lateness}} that night; and as Phyllis considered herself to be the cause of his disgrace her sorrow was great. But the position was now reversed; {{it was his turn to}} cheer her.|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile, Mrs. Stetson {{had been}} {{revolving}} a design in her mind, and one afternoon she did some canvassing {{on her own}} account. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> saw Lovell she said: ...|$|E

60|$|Anne made up {{her mind}} that <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> wrote a story she wouldn't ask anybody to criticize it. It was too discouraging. She would not read the story to Gilbert, {{although}} she told him about it.|$|E
50|$|Sudha had written, {{that this}} <b>time</b> <b>she</b> left him but she won’t {{be able to}} do it <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time.</b> How <b>she</b> should take care of herself, when she watches his face {{sometimes}} she only gets peace. She doesn’t know where the storm of her life will take her. She has been spending her days in his memories, and asks him to hide behind her memories.|$|R
60|$|Maggie felt a {{great relief}} in {{adjourning}} the decision. She was free now {{to enjoy the}} minutes of companionship; she almost thought she might linger a little; <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> they met <b>she</b> should have to pain Philip by telling him her determination.|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> he came <b>she</b> said: “I {{have been}} {{thinking}} over what you said, monsieur, and I feel {{that it would be}} cowardly indeed if I were to shrink from incurring some little danger for the sake of Lucien.

60|$|Dorothy {{seemed very}} much pleased, and promised the boys that, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> baked pies, she would kindle {{the fire in}} the oven with their {{kindling}} wood, and then she would bake them each a little apple turnover.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not {{everything}} but most things. And she didn't tell {{me so much}} as I guessed it. She'll tell me more <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time.</b> <b>She</b> will behave properly now about coming in to see me; I told her she ought to.' ...|$|E
50|$|Regularly bullied {{in school}} {{because of his}} homosexuality, Billy found solace outside {{the gates of the}} Avengers Mansion. One day, Billy {{encountered}} the Avenger the Scarlet Witch, who told him to stand his ground <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> it happens. <b>She</b> then touched his head, causing a red light to flash briefly. The flash healed Billy's wounds, and a few weeks later, he stood up for another kid being bullied, demonstrating his mutant powers for the first time, and nearly killing his tormentor.|$|R
5000|$|One morning, Lauren hears a noise {{coming from}} the upper floor of the house. She goes upstairs to {{investigate}} but finds no one there. Lauren goes upstairs again <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day. This <b>time,</b> <b>she</b> finds a man sitting {{in one of the}} bedrooms. The man's appearance varies each time Lauren sees him, but in this first incarnation, he is described as [...] "smallish and fine-boned resembling a kid, sandy-haired and roused from deep sleep" [...] (43).|$|R

6000|$|... "About the woman," [...] said Ralph; [...] "it {{is of the}} {{greatest}} importance that we should {{know where she is}} now living.

50|$|Rather {{than take}} {{immediate}} action, {{they follow the}} passengers to a wedding party, where Emily recognises {{one of the group}} as the man who had the heated argument with Salwen — only he now speaks fluent English and introduces himself as Teperson, one of the names on Stefan's list. Emily slips away, eavesdrops on another conversation and learns that the group will be leaving on a train for Chicago <b>the</b> <b>next</b> evening. This <b>time,</b> <b>she</b> is intercepted by bodyguards and taken to a restaurant where Salwen is waiting to meet her.|$|R
5000|$|Daniel reaches his {{breaking}} point. Miserable {{and determined}} not to be alone forever, he comes out to his mother <b>the</b> very <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> starts talking about available young women. This time he is direct and asserts {{that he wants to}} be with Robert. Mrs. Chang reacts angrily, lecturing Daniel in her native tongue and storming away from him. In her confusion, disappointment and fear of losing Daniel (who threatened to move out), she turns to the only other woman she knows with a gay son, Robert's mother. Robert's mother asks Mrs. Chang if it wouldn't be so bad to have another son, a clever way of getting around the cultural taboo of same-sex love. Shortly thereafter, Mrs. Chang calls Daniel back home to meet another potential date. Daniel flips out and races back home to stand up to his mother for the last time. He opens the door bellowing out, [...] "Mother!" [...] but almost chokes from surprise when Robert walks toward him instead. Mrs. Chang had invited Robert to be part of their family.|$|R
50|$|Avila Stars route was now changed yet again. She left Avonmouth on 15 October 1941 {{and reached}} the Firth of Clyde <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day. This <b>time</b> <b>she</b> joined a small transatlantic convoy, CT 4, {{which seems to have}} been three {{passenger}} liners sailing together with no naval escort. CT 4 left the Clyde on 17 October bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia, but Avila seems to have left en route to reach Trinidad on 30 October without calling at Halifax. She then called at Buenos Aires and Montevideo and returned via Trinidad to reach Liverpool on 26 December 1941.|$|R

6000|$|What was her {{surprise}} then, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> went abroad in her chair, to be cheered by a hundred persons, white and black, and shouts of [...] "Huzzah, Madam!"

50|$|Sara Irine: One of {{the twelve}} Valkyries of Freya. She is first seen {{attempting}} to hunt down Fenris Fenrir, although the warlock escapes. She then devastates Fayon with an army of Giants. Sara is, in fact, the half-sister of Iris. For some horrible, unknown reason, Sara's (and Iris's) father killed Sara's mother and tried to kill Sara as well. Sara fled the village of Fayon and became consumed with a thirst for vengeance. She met and killed her father during the attack on Fayon, earning Iris's hatred. Curiously, she saves both Iris and Fenrir from the witch Bijou, though she dispassionately tells her half-sister that she will finish her <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> they meet. <b>She</b> wields the legendary Sword of Retribution, Haeryongdo.|$|R

Shortly before the Olympics she set world records in the 4 × 100 m medley relay and 100 m breaststroke.
