40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} confer optimal {{strength}} and stiffness to the graft in Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction, {{the maintenance of}} equal strand tension prior to fixation, is desired; positioning of the <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> can significantly affect strand tension This study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> mal-positioning on individual strand tension in simulated cadaveric ACL reconstructions. Methods Twenty cadaveric specimens, comprising bovine tibia and tendon harvested from sheep, were used to simulate ACL reconstruction with a looped four-strand tendon graft. A proprietary <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> was used to tension the graft during tibial component fixation with graft tension recorded using load cells. The effects of the <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> at extreme angles, and in various locking states, was evaluated. Results Strand tension varied significantly when the <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> was held at extreme angles (p Conclusion An even distribution of tension among individual graft strands is obtained by maintaining the <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> in an unlocked state, aligned with the longitudinal axis of the tibial tunnel. If the maintenance of equal strand tension during tibial fixation of grafts is important, close attention must be paid to positioning of the <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> in order to optimize the resultant graft tension and, by implication, the strength and stiffness of the graft and ultimately, surgical outcome. </p...|$|R
40|$|The <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> is {{designed}} to pull the contact wire straight at all times. Pulling a contact wire straight ensures that smooth contact is maintained at all times between the contact wire and pantograph of an electric train, and this {{makes it possible to}} ensure a stable supply of electricity to the train. Normally, <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> are installed at two positions over a distance of 1 to 1. 6 km per line. Fig. 1 shows a conceptual view {{of the relationship between the}} contact wire and pulley type balancer. The <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> can be broadly classified into the two types; the wheel type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> that pulls the contact wire by concrete or iron weights and the spring type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> that use the force of a spring to pull it. Fig. 2 shows the wheel type balancer, while Fig. 3 represents the spring type balancer. The spring type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> comprises a spring and a sleeve for accommodating the spring. Only the sleeve portion is visible to the outside. The wheel depends on gravity acting on the weight to produce tension, so it is possible to pull the contact wire at an almost uniform force, regardless of the height of the weight. In the spring type The wheel type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> used in the Tohoku and Joetsu Shinkansen lines of JR East requires much time and labor for maintenance including wire replacement and oil application. Further, parts become superannuated and in need of periodic replacement very quickly. So we found it necessary to develop a new type of maintenance-free <b>tensioning</b> <b>device.</b> To accomplish this, we have been making efforts since 1999 to develop a new spring type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> for Shinkansen, making effective use of the spring type balancer technologies used in the narrow gauge lines, where the major target is to develop a maintenance-free <b>tensioning</b> <b>device.</b> Thus, fairly satisfactory development results have been attained.

50|$|A dynamic {{compression}} plate (DCP) is a metallic plate used in orthopedics for internal fixation of bone, typically after fractures. As the name implies, {{it is designed}} to exert dynamic pressure between the bone fragments to be transfixed. Dynamic compression is achieved either by attaching a <b>tension</b> <b>device</b> to a plate or by using a special {{dynamic compression}} plate. However, compression plating requires a longer surgical incision to allow insertion of the <b>tension</b> <b>device</b> and the possibility of refracture after the plate is removed. A neutralization plate is used to bridge a comminuted fracture; it also transmits bending or torsional forces from the proximal to the distal fragment. Plates used for buttressing prevent collapse by supporting an area of thin cortex or cancellous bone graft.|$|E

The account is highly detailed, if incredibly dense. It describes a single-armed torsion machine on a triangular frame that could hurl 50 lbs. stones. Additionally, Persian double-armed devices similar to ancient Greek design are also described. The major problem with this source, however, {{is that most of}} the illustrations show trebuchets, not onagers or other torsion machines. Also by the 12th century, siege engines were used in batteries, often consisting of large numbers of torsion devices, as in Philip Augustus’ siege of Chinon in 1205 during which he collected 400 cords for petrariae. These batteries were gradually replaced with trebuchets and early gunpowder machines.|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{performed}} at Vendig AB {{which is a}} company that develops and sells products such as belt scrapers for conveyor. The thesis is divided into two parts, one part where it´s investigated which tension force is required to tighten Vendig AB´s scraper Hampus against the belt in a correct way. The second part is called mechanical design and here a new and more compact <b>tension</b> <b>device</b> is developed. Field studies has been conducted at a couple of Vendig AB´s costumers to get a knowledge base about how Vendig AB´s products are used, how they function and the environment they operate in.

Therefore, nerve gaps are most commonly repaired with grafts.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} suture tension in primary wound closure of mucoperiosteal flaps. Materials and methods: Sixty patients, scheduled for a single implant installation, were recruited. Before suturing, the wound closing forces were measured with an electronic <b>tension</b> <b>device.</b> One week after the surgery, the wounds were inspected with regard to complete closure. Results: The applied tension varied between 0. 01 and 0. 4 N. In 72 % a tension of 0. 01 - 0. 1 N was applied, resulting in few dehiscences (10 %). Higher closing forces (> 0. 1 N) increased the percentage of wound dehiscences significantly (≥ 40 %).

Stress relaxation limit of 7050 aluminum alloys decreases with increasing aging temperature. The threshold stress presents during the stress relaxation process due to the interaction between precipitation behavior and dislocation creep of 7050 aluminum alloys.

40|$|AbstractThe {{consideration}} of time dependence {{is essential for}} the study of deformation and fracturing processes of rock materials, especially for those subjected to strong compressive and tensile stresses. In this paper, the self-developed direct <b>tension</b> <b>device</b> and creep testing machine RLW- 2000 M are used to conduct the creep tests on red sandstone under uniaxial compressive and tensile stresses. The short-term and long-term creep behaviors of rocks under compressive and tensile stresses are investigated, as well as the long-term strength of rocks. It is shown that, under low-stress levels, the creep curve of sandstone consists of decay and steady creep stages; while under high-stress levels, it presents the accelerated creep stage and creep fracture presents characteristics of brittle materials. The relationship between tensile stress and time under uniaxial tension is also put forward. Finally, a nonlinear viscoelastoplastic creep model is used to describe the creep behaviors of rocks under uniaxial compressive and tensile stresses...|$|E
