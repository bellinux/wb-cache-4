5|$|On April 3, 2013, Torres {{was traded}} to the San Jose Sharks for a third-round draft pick in the 2013 draft. On April 16, 2013, Torres made his first shootout attempt in two years against the Los Angeles Kings to give <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> the 3-2 victory. Torres scored the game-winning goal in {{overtime}} of game two of round one against his former team, the Vancouver Canucks. <b>The</b> <b>Sharks</b> swept the series.|$|E
5|$|Returning to <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> in 2005–06, Ehrhoff {{recorded}} a 23-point campaign. He began earning more ice time {{near the end}} of the season as he improved his defensive play. On 13 April 2006, he scored the game-winning overtime goal against the Vancouver Canucks for <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> to clinch a playoff berth, despite San Jose having previously been eight points out of a playoff spot with a month-and-a-half remaining in the season. Ehrhoff added eight points over 11 post-season games—first among team defencemen—in his first Stanley Cup playoffs as <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> were eliminated in the second round by the Edmonton Oilers. He then signed a two-year contract worth US$1.7 million in the off-season.|$|E
5|$|Vancouver {{entered the}} playoffs as the Western Conference's third seed {{by virtue of}} winning the Northwest Division. As a result, they faced the sixth-seeded San Jose Sharks. The series was a rematch of the 2011 Western Conference Finals, in which Vancouver {{defeated}} <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> in five games {{to advance to the}} 2011 Stanley Cup Finals. However, <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> had won all three of the regular season games during the season.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>shark</b> {{is often}} colonized by the {{parasitic}} and bioluminescent copepod Ommatokoita elongata, which attaches itself to <b>the</b> <b>shark's</b> eyes and attracts prey to <b>the</b> <b>shark's</b> head. <b>The</b> <b>shark</b> occupies what {{tends to be}} a very deep environment seeking its preferable cold water (...) habitat.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>shark</b> {{emerges from}} <b>the</b> ground, {{knocking}} Mort into the basement. Teddy falls into <b>the</b> <b>shark’s</b> mouth, though his “boydle” prevents {{him from being}} crushed by its teeth. Tina gets the idea to fill <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> with yogurt from their frozen yogurt machine, which has fallen inside <b>the</b> <b>shark’s</b> body. Bob is able to plug in the machine, and <b>the</b> <b>shark,</b> now filled with yogurt, finally ends its rampage. On a news report, Hugo, the health inspector and [...] "Quadrant Captain," [...] takes credit for stopping <b>the</b> <b>shark.</b>|$|R
50|$|The only {{survivors}} are Kate, Paul, and Kirsten (Nobili), {{who had taken}} shelter in a village chapel and escaped <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> when it broke in. They discover a gasoline tank, and lure <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> towards it. Kate plans to stab <b>the</b> <b>shark,</b> but Kirsten sacrifices her to try to blow up <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> as it eats her. However, only one of <b>the</b> <b>shark's</b> heads get blown off. Kate and Paul find one of the boats and turn it on as a decoy, taking shelter on part of the remaining atoll. <b>The</b> <b>shark</b> attacks <b>the</b> unmanned boat. It bites the motor, which explodes, finally killing <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> (a hommage to Jaws). A helicopter arrives, saving Kate and Paul, leaving only 2 survivors out of 23 people.|$|R
5|$|In game one of {{the second}} round of the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Kings, Torres {{recorded}} a hit on Jarret Stoll, injuring him. The hit was an illegal check to the head and Torres was a repeat offender; therefore, on May 16, the NHL suspended Torres for the remainder of the second round, which <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> lost. On June 20, 2013 <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> announced that they had re-signed Torres to a three-year contract. In the second 2013 preseason game against the Anaheim Ducks, Torres collided with Emerson Etem, causing Torres to injure his ACL, and was out until mid-February. Torres returned to <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> on February 27 against the Flyers. Torres recorded three points during the Sharks' opening round, seven game loss to the Los Angeles Kings in the 2014 Stanley Cup Playoffs. He then missed the entire 2014–15 NHL season due to injury.|$|E
5|$|Yao {{first tried}} {{out for the}} Shanghai Sharks junior team of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) when he was {{thirteen}} years old, and practiced ten {{hours a day for}} his acceptance. After playing with the junior team for four years, Yao joined the senior team of <b>the</b> <b>Sharks,</b> where he averaged 10points and 8rebounds a game in his rookie season. His next season was cut short when he broke his foot {{for the second time in}} his career, which Yao said decreased his jumping ability by four to six inches (10 to 15cm). <b>The</b> <b>Sharks</b> made the finals of the CBA in Yao's third season and again the next year, but lost both times to the Bayi Rockets. When Wang Zhizhi left the Bayi Rockets to become the first NBA player from China the following year, <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> finally won their first CBA championship. During the playoffs in his final year with Shanghai, Yao averaged 38.9points and 20.2rebounds a game, while shooting 76.6% from the field, and made all 21 of his shots during one game in the finals.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Solitaire {{are saved}} when the limpet mine explodes seconds {{before they are}} dragged over the reef: though {{temporarily}} stunned by the explosion and injured on the coral, they are protected from the explosion by the reef and Bond watches as Mr Big, who survived the explosion, is killed by <b>the</b> <b>sharks</b> and barracuda. Quarrel then rescues the couple.|$|E
50|$|Requiem {{sharks are}} <b>sharks</b> of <b>the</b> family Carcharhinidae {{in the order}} Carcharhiniformes, {{containing}} migratory, live-bearing sharks of warm seas (sometimes of brackish or fresh water) such as <b>the</b> spinner <b>shark,</b> <b>the</b> blacknose <b>shark,</b> <b>the</b> blacktip <b>shark,</b> <b>the</b> blacktail reef <b>shark,</b> and <b>the</b> blacktip reef <b>shark.</b>|$|R
5000|$|At the {{unveiling}} of <b>the</b> <b>shark,</b> <b>the</b> Belchers find out Fischoeder has filled it with diesel. <b>The</b> <b>shark,</b> which is now able to move, nearly causes an accident by ripping off a woman’s prosthetic arm. Early the next morning, the Belcher kids sneak off to Wonder Wharf to steal <b>the</b> <b>shark’s</b> fin for [...] "mechanical shark fin soup." [...] Gene mounts <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> with a knife to cut off its fin, but he accidentally knocks <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> off its perch: the kids leave, and Louise tells her siblings to act like they were [...] "never there." ...|$|R
500|$|A {{few days}} later, they {{encounter}} <b>the</b> same <b>shark</b> that slew Sean. Jake {{is eager to}} do research on <b>the</b> <b>shark,</b> because great white sharks hardly come to the Bahamas as the water there is too warm, and sharks are misunderstood creatures, but Michael asks him not to mention <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> due to Ellen's attempts to convince him {{to find a job}} on land. Ellen becomes so obsessive, that she begins having nightmares and premonitions of being attacked by a shark. Then, she starts getting psychic feelings when <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> is near or attacks. She and <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> have a strange connection that is unexplained. Jake decides to attach a device to <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> that can track it through its heartbeat. Using chum to attract it, Jake stabs the device's tracking pole into <b>the</b> <b>shark's</b> side. <b>The</b> next day, <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> chases Mike through a sunken ship, and he narrowly escapes in one piece.|$|R
5|$|Evidence of dugong {{predation}} {{was identified}} {{in one study}} that found dugong tissue in 15 of 85 tiger sharks caught off the Australian coast. Additionally, examination of adult dugongs has shown scars from failed shark attacks. To minimize attacks, dugong microhabitats shift similarly to those of known tiger shark prey when <b>the</b> <b>sharks</b> are abundant.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 Massachusetts banned catching, cage diving, feeding, towing decoys, or baiting and chumming for its {{significant}} and highly predictable migratory great white population without an appropriate research permit. The goal of these restrictions is to both protect <b>the</b> <b>sharks</b> and public health.|$|E
5|$|Sharks {{belong to}} the {{superorder}} Selachimorpha in the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. The Elasmobranchii also include rays and skates; the Chondrichthyes also include Chimaeras. It is currently thought that <b>the</b> <b>sharks</b> form a polyphyletic group: some sharks are {{more closely related to}} rays than they are to some other sharks.|$|E
5|$|Mike {{continues}} to blast <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> with <b>the</b> impulses, {{causing it to}} leap {{out of the water}} again, igniting the bomb as Ellen steers the sailboat towards <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> while thinking back to Sean's demise, <b>the</b> <b>shark's</b> attack on Thea, and when her husband killed <b>the</b> first <b>shark.</b> <b>The</b> broken bowsprit impales <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> in <b>the</b> exact spot where the bomb is, causing it to explode on impact. <b>The</b> <b>shark's</b> corpse then sinks {{to the bottom of the}} sea. Mike then hears Jake calling for help, seriously injured, but alive and conscious, floating in the water. The four survive the harsh encounter and make it back to land. Hoagie then flies Ellen back to Amity Island.|$|R
5|$|Based on morphology, Leonard Compagno in 1988 {{tentatively}} grouped <b>the</b> smoothtooth blacktip <b>shark</b> with <b>the</b> spinner <b>shark</b> (C. brevipinna), <b>the</b> blacktip <b>shark</b> (C. limbatus), <b>the</b> graceful <b>shark</b> (C. amblyrhynchoides), and <b>the</b> finetooth <b>shark</b> (C. isodon). Using molecular phylogenetic techniques on mitochondrial DNA sequences, Alec Moore {{and colleagues}} reported in 2011 that this species {{is closely related}} to <b>the</b> graceful <b>shark,</b> <b>the</b> blacktip <b>shark,</b> and <b>the</b> Australian blacktip <b>shark</b> (C. tilstoni).|$|R
5|$|The next day, Kay and Michael Brody are {{informed}} of Overman's disappearance. They {{go down in}} a submarine to look for his body, and during the search, they encounter a smaller <b>shark.</b> <b>The</b> dolphins rescue Kay and Mike, but <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> escapes back into the park. The news of <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> is disbelieved by Calvin Bouchard, the park manager, though it excites his hunter friend, Phillip FitzRoyce, who states his intention to kill <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> on network television. Kay protests and suggests capturing and keeping <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> alive in captivity, to guarantee more publicity for <b>the</b> park. <b>The</b> <b>shark</b> is successfully captured and Kay and her staff nurse it to health. Calvin, desperate to start the money rolling in immediately, orders it moved to an exhibit, but <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> dies.|$|R

5|$|Some 97% of {{the common}} thresher's diet is {{composed}} of bony fishes, mostly small schooling forage fish such as mackerel, bluefish, herring, needlefish, and lanternfish. Before striking, <b>the</b> <b>sharks</b> compact schools of prey by swimming around them and splashing the water with its tail, often in pairs or small groups. Threshers are also known to take large, solitary fishes such as lancetfish, as well as squid and other pelagic invertebrates. Off California, common threshers feed mostly on the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), with Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus), market squid (Loligo opalescens), and pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes) also being important food items. <b>The</b> <b>sharks</b> concentrate on a few prey species during cold water years, but become less discriminating during less productive, warmer El Niño periods.|$|E
5|$|The primary food of Galapagos {{sharks are}} benthic bony fishes (including eels, sea bass, flatfish, flatheads, and triggerfish) and octopuses. They also {{occasionally}} take surface-dwelling prey such as mackerel, flyingfish, and squid. As <b>the</b> <b>sharks</b> grow larger, they consume {{increasing numbers of}} elasmobranchs (rays and smaller sharks, including of their own species) and crustaceans, as well as indigestible items such as leaves, coral, rocks, and garbage. At the Galapagos Islands, this species has been observed attacking Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), and marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). While collecting fishes at Clipperton Island, Limbaugh (1963) noted that juvenile Galapagos sharks surrounded the boat, with multiple individuals rushing at virtually anything trailing {{in the water and}} striking the boat bottom, oars, and marker buoys. <b>The</b> <b>sharks</b> were not slowed by rotenone (a fish toxin) or shark repellent, and some followed the boat into water so shallow that their backs were exposed.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, a shark hunter chains some spare ribs to {{the side}} of a dock. The man, a TV {{cameraman}} and some spectators go stand on the dock, when <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> takes <b>the</b> ribs, towing the dock out into the ocean. Suddenly, <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> begins to attack the dock, knocking the people into the water and eating <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> hunter and a TV Cameraman. Benton arrives and rescues the other people, but gets trapped on the dock when <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> arrives to drag it further out to sea. Hammer's corpse floats by and Benton feeds it to <b>the</b> <b>shark.</b> Realising he has the detonator in his hand, Benton leaps into the ocean and flips the switch, detonating the dynamite and blowing <b>the</b> <b>shark's</b> head off.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>shark</b> nearly gets Sam {{on his way}} to {{the ship}} (biting off part of his shoe), but Sam distracts <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> with a bone (as if <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> was a dog), goes back to the ship (retrieving one match) and gets back to land. However, Bugs is not in the pot. When he checks <b>the</b> pot, <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> jumps out and starts eating Sam, but Sam manages to whack <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> with a mallet - soon whacking himself, when <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> jumps off. Bugs is then shown to be on the ship itself (calling out to Sam as [...] "Mister Robinson", making direct {{reference}} to the story). [...] "Ill get ya, ya long-eared galoot, shark or no shark!", Sam bellows.|$|R
50|$|Bob, as “Block Captain,” rallies {{the local}} {{business}} owners {{to figure out}} what to do about <b>the</b> <b>shark.</b> Tina, who empathized with <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> after watching <b>The</b> Deepening, tries to dissuade the townspeople from stopping its progress. After she impulsively confesses that she and the kids knocked over <b>the</b> <b>shark,</b> <b>the</b> townspeople begin to turn on the Belchers. But Teddy encourages the townspeople to work together, and they begin brainstorming how to stop <b>the</b> <b>shark,</b> which is now heading towards Bob's restaurant.|$|R
5|$|As the February 29 trade {{deadline}} approached, Reimer's {{future with}} the rebuilding Maple Leafs became uncertain. On February 27, 2016, {{two days before}} the deadline, Reimer was traded to the San Jose Sharks, alongside Jeremy Morin, in exchange for Alex Stalock, Ben Smith and a conditional fourth round pick in the 2018 draft (condition dependent on <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> reaching the Stanley Cup Finals; condition met and pick was converted to a third round pick on May 25, 2016).|$|E
5|$|Encounters with tawny nurse sharks {{underwater}} {{indicate a}} more docile demeanor than the similar nurse shark; usually divers {{are able to}} approach <b>the</b> <b>sharks</b> closely and even touch and play with them without incident. However, this species has been infrequently provoked into biting, and merits respect due to its strength, small but sharp teeth, and extremely powerful jaws. Tawny nurse sharks are favored attractions for ecotourist divers off Thailand, the Solomon Islands, and elsewhere. This species also adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquaria in Europe, the United States, Okinawa, and Singapore, where they may become tame enough to be hand-fed.|$|E
5|$|Following the season, the Rangers did not {{exercise}} their option, and traded Fleury's playing {{rights to the}} San Jose Sharks, which entitled <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> to a compensatory draft pick if Fleury signed elsewhere. He did so with a two-year, $8.5million contract with the Chicago Blackhawks. Two days prior {{to the opening of}} the 2002–03 season, he was suspended by the NHL for violating the terms of the league's substance abuse program. The Blackhawks hired one of Fleury's friends, also a recovering alcoholic, to ensure that he attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and abided by the terms of the NHL's aftercare program.|$|E
50|$|That evening, Steven lures <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> with a {{devilfish}} he has speared for the occasion, {{and when}} he hears <b>the</b> <b>shark's</b> rasping approach shoots it with a speargun with an explosive charge. <b>The</b> <b>shark</b> rips off Steven's arm but it is finally destroyed by the explosive.|$|R
50|$|Commensalism {{benefits}} one organism and {{the other}} organism is neither benefited nor harmed. It occurs when one organism takes benefits by interacting with another organism by which the host organism is not affected. A good example is a remora living with a shark. Remoras eat leftover food from <b>the</b> <b>shark.</b> <b>The</b> <b>shark</b> is not affected in the process, as remoras eat only leftover food of <b>the</b> <b>shark,</b> which does not deplete <b>the</b> <b>shark's</b> resources.|$|R
50|$|With Tom gone, Jerry {{begins to}} charm the fish, but is soon terrified by <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> that {{has entered the}} fishbowl.

5|$|Following {{their last}} {{place in the}} 1997 season, Tony Gilbert was {{appointed}} coach. Before the season began the Otago Highlanders were rated 100 to 1 odds of winning the competition in 1998. Their first game was against the Queensland Redswho had {{finished in the top}} four in 1997who they upset 2619. Although they lost to the ACT Brumbies and then the Auckland Blues in rounds two and three, they then defeated 1997 finalists <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> in round four. They eventually became the first New Zealand side to defeat all four South African teams in one season (the Crusaders achieved the same feat one day later).|$|E
5|$|Former first five-eighth Tony Brown {{holds the}} record for most career points with 857. His 857 career points {{included}} 144conversions, 183penalties, and six drop-goals. The most points in a single match is held by former fullback Ben Blair who scored 28 against <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> in 2005. Most career tries is held by former player Jeff Wilson with 35. Wilson and Blair also share {{the record for}} most tries in a single match with three along with Israel Dagg, Doug Howlett, Ryan Nicholas, Jeremy Stanley, and To'o Vaega.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of pigeye sharks across northern Australia {{suggest that the}} evolutionary history of this species was affected by coastline changes during the Pleistocene epoch (2.6 million to 12,000 years ago). The patterns of diversity found in its mitochondrial DNA {{are consistent with the}} repeated splitting and merging of its populations as geographical barriers were alternately formed and inundated. The most recent of these barriers was a land bridge across the Torres Strait that reopened only some 6,000 years ago; as a result, significant genetic separation exists between <b>the</b> <b>sharks</b> found off Western Australia and the Northern Territory and those found off Queensland.|$|E
5|$|With the Orca slowly sinking, {{the trio}} attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on scuba gear {{and enters the}} water in a shark-proof cage, {{intending}} to lethally inject <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> with strychnine using a hypodermic spear. <b>The</b> <b>shark</b> demolishes <b>the</b> cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to <b>the</b> seabed. <b>The</b> <b>shark</b> then attacks <b>the</b> boat directly, killing Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody stuffs a pressurized scuba tank into <b>the</b> <b>shark's</b> mouth, and, climbing the mast, shoots the tank with Quint's rifle, destroying it.
