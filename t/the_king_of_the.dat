5|$|Historically <b>the</b> <b>King</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Welsh {{people would}} travel, with his court, in a circuit, {{demanding}} tribute {{in the form}} of food from communities they visited as they went.

The laws show how much value was put on different parts of Welsh life at the time, for example that wealth was measured in cattle; they also show that the court included hunters, who would be restricted to seasonal hunting sessions.|$|E
