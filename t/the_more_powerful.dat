5|$|The AH-64A is the {{original}} production attack helicopter. The crew sit in tandem in an armored compartment. It is powered by two GE T700 turboshaft engines. The A-model was equipped with the −701 engine version until 1990 when the engines were switched to <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> −701C version.|$|E
5|$|There was {{danger of}} {{invasion}} from <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> French forces, so Adams and the Federalist congress built up the army, bringing back Washington as its commander. Washington wanted Hamilton {{to be his}} second-in-command and Adams reluctantly accommodated. It became apparent that Hamilton was truly in charge due to Washington's advanced years.|$|E

25|$|The Hanriot D.I {{formed the}} basis of <b>the</b> much <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> but {{otherwise}} similar Ponnier D.III 1913 Gordon Bennett Trophy racer.|$|R
5|$|Although {{none were}} ever built, several {{derivatives}} of Black Arrow were also proposed, as ways of increasing its payload capacity. One proposal added eight Raven solid rocket motors from the Skylark programme {{to the first}} stage as booster rockets. Another suggestion was to mount the entire rocket atop a Blue Streak missile, while a third proposal involved replacing the Gamma engines with <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> Larch.|$|E
5|$|Building on the Omega, the SV6 is {{equipped}} with <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> High Output variant of the Alloytec V6 engine, coupled to a six-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. Air conditioning, a key feature missing on the launch Omega, came standard on the SV6. A body kit and sports suspension similar to the V8 Commodore SS/SS V variants is also fitted. The SV6 sports the Performance interior look, characterised by an accentuated matte black centre console and red lighting, {{as opposed to the}} silver Functional-style interior of the Omega.|$|E
5|$|F-16E/F: The F-16E (single seat) and F-16F (two seat) are newer F-16 variants. The Block 60 {{version is}} based on the F-16C/D Block 50/52 and has been {{developed}} especially for the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It features improved AN/APG-80 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, avionics, conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), and <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> General Electric F110-GE-132 engine.|$|E

5|$|Gripen NG: {{improved}} version following on {{from the}} Gripen Demo technology demonstrator. Changes from the JAS 39C/D include <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> F414G engine, Raven ES-05 AESA radar, increased fuel capacity and payload, two additional hardpoints, and other improvements. These improvements have reportedly increased the Gripen NG costs to an estimated 24,000 Swiss Francs (US$27,000) per hour, and increased the flyaway cost to 100 million Swiss Francs (US$113M).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Rick was the second-latest {{hurricane}} ever {{to make landfall}} in Mexico. The eighteenth named storm, {{ninth and}} final hurricane of the 1997 Pacific hurricane season, Rick was a short-lived Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale that weakened before making landfall in Mexico on November 10. It hit almost a month after <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> Hurricane Pauline made landfall in the same country. Most of the damage associated with Pauline was exacerbated by the weaker Rick, which struck during rebuilding efforts.|$|E
5|$|In later years, Wolff said he {{was always}} wary of Heydrich, {{who seemed to be}} waiting for an {{opportunity}} to move against him and disgrace him with Himmler. Within the Allgemeine-SS, Heydrich forged relationships with some of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> SS and Police Leaders such as Friedrich Jeckeln. Heydrich maintained a dialogue with him, but cautiously, especially after Jeckeln ran afoul of Himmler in the late 1930s and early 1940s.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> much <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> HERO 2000 {{included}} several onboard microprocessors, onboard speech synthesis, several sensors, {{and the ability}} to add expansion cards using a passive backplane.|$|R
5|$|Kutuzov {{was very}} {{strongly}} {{concerned that the}} French might take the New Smolensk Road around his positions and on to Moscow so placed <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> 1stArmy under Barclay on the right, in positions which were already strong and virtually unassailable by the French. The 2ndArmy under Bagration was expected to hold the left. The fall of Shevardino unanchored the Russian left flank but Kutuzov did nothing to change these initial dispositions despite the repeated pleas of his generals to redeploy their forces.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{consist of}} several missions, {{which are based}} around the {{destruction}} of enemy weapons and installations, as well as rescuing hostages or prisoners of war, or capturing enemy personnel. The Apache is armed with a machine gun, more powerful Hydra rockets and yet more deadly Hellfire missiles. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> the weapon, the fewer can be carried: the player must choose an appropriate weapon for each situation. Enemy weapons range from soldiers with small arms, to anti-aircraft missiles to tanks and armoured cars.|$|E

5|$|McCudden {{was based}} at Farnborough and began his {{training}} on 22 February 1916. He {{started with a}} 20-minute flight in a Henry Farman pusher. McCudden had already flown 100 hours as a passenger with 25 different pilots including 46 hours as a regular observer since November 1915 and had much experience with his surroundings. His instructor was impressed with his grasp of the mechanics and theory. He practiced six landings and progressed to <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> Avro 504 as the last Farman had been written off by another student.|$|E
5|$|The Classic was an {{adaptation}} of Jerry Manock's and Terry Oyama's 1984 Macintosh 128K industrial design, as had been the earlier Macintosh SE. Apple released two versions that ranged in price from $1,000 to $1,500. The price {{and the availability of}} education software led to the Classic's popularity in education. It was sold alongside <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> Macintosh Classic II in 1991 until its discontinuation the next year.|$|E
5|$|The Do 17L-0 and Do 17M-0 were {{developed}} in parallel as replacements for the earlier E and Fs, the L being the reconnaissance version. Both were designed around <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> DB 600A engines, delivering about 746kW (1,000hp). Two L and one M versions were built as prototypes, both with another MG 15 in the nose. The first prototype of the revised version, the Do 17M V1 (D-ABVD) was powered by two DB 600s, and demonstrated impressive performance, including a maximum speed of 425km/h (264mph).|$|E

5|$|The E-1 variant with Jumo 211A-1 engines was {{developed}} in 1937, the He 111 V6 being the first production variant. The E-1 had its original powerplant, the DB 600 replaced with the Jumo 210 Ga engines. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> Jumo 211 A-1 engines desired by the Ministry of Aviation were not yet ready for installation. Another trial aircraft, He 111 V10 (D-ALEQ) was to be fitted with two oil coolers necessary for the Jumo 211 A-1 installation.|$|E
5|$|The Fat Man and Pumpkin bombs (non-nuclear {{bombs that}} resembled and handled like Fat Man) weighed over , so weight was a concern, even with <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> engines. Weight {{reduction}} {{was accomplished by}} removal of all gun turrets and armor plating. This work {{was done by the}} 509th Composite Group for the early Silverplate aircraft, but later models were delivered without them. These B-29s represented a significant increase in performance over the standard variants.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{into two}} kingdoms {{is most likely}} to date back to the sixth century; east Kent may have conquered west Kent and preserved the institutions of kingship as a subkingdom. This was a common pattern in Anglo-Saxon England, as <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> kingdoms absorbed their weaker neighbours. An unusual feature of the Kentish system was that only sons of kings appeared to be legitimate claimants to the throne, although this did not eliminate all strife over the succession.|$|E
