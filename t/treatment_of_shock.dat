50|$|One {{of the key}} {{dangers of}} shock is that it {{progresses}} by a positive feedback mechanism. Poor blood supply leads to cellular damage, which results in an inflammatory response to increase {{blood flow to the}} affected area. This is normally very useful to match up blood supply level with tissue demand for nutrients. However, if enough tissue causes this, it will deprive vital nutrients {{from other parts of the}} body. Additionally, the ability of the circulatory system to meet this increase in demand causes saturation, and this is a major result, of which other parts of the body begin to respond in a similar way; thus, exacerbating the problem. Due to this chain of events, immediate <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> is critical for survival.|$|E
5000|$|R Adams Cowley (July 25, 1917 - October 27, 1991), the [...] "Father of Trauma Medicine," [...] was an American surgeon {{considered}} {{a pioneer in}} emergency medicine and the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> trauma. He was {{the founder of the}} United States's first trauma center at the University of Maryland, in 1958, after the US Army awarded Dr. Cowley $100,000 to study shock in people—the first award {{of its kind in the}} United States. The trauma unit at first consisted of two beds, and was later expanded to four beds. Many people called the four-bed unit the [...] "death lab." [...] Dr. Cowley was the creator of the [...] "Golden Hour" [...] concept, the period of 60 minutes or less following injury when immediate definitive care is crucial to a trauma patient's survival. He was a leader in the use of helicopters for medical evacuations of civilians, beginning in 1969, and founded the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. He also founded the nation's first statewide EMS system, called MIEMSS by Executive Order of Maryland's Governor Mandel, 1972, as well as the National Study Center for Trauma and EMS, enacted by Congress in 1986 and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. He is also known for being one of the first surgeons to perform open-heart surgery and invented both a surgical clamp that bears his name and a prototype pacemaker that was used by Dwight D. Eisenhower.|$|E

40|$|Anisotropic {{unstructured}} mesh adaption {{is developed}} {{for a truly}} multi-dimensional upwind fluctuation splitting scheme, as applied to scalar advection-diffusion. The adaption is performed locally using edge swapping, point insertion/deletion, and nodal displacements. Comparisons are made versus {{the current state of}} the art for aggressive anisotropic unstructured adaption, which is based on a posteriori error estimates. Demonstration of both schemes to model problems, with features representative of compressible gas dynamics, show the present method to be superior to the a posteriori adaption for linear advection. The performance of the two methods is more similar when applied to nonlinear advection, with a difference in the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>shocks.</b> The a posteriori adaption can excessively cluster points to a shock, while the present multi-dimensional scheme tends to merely align with a shock, using fewer nodes. As a consequence of this alignment tendency, an implementation of eigenvalue limiting for the suppression <b>of</b> expansion <b>shocks</b> is developed for the multi-dimensional distribution scheme. The differences in the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> by the adaption schemes, along with the inherently low levels of artificial dissipation in the fluctuation splitting solver, suggest the present method is a strong candidate for applications to compressible gas dynamics...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} a number <b>of</b> essays on <b>shocks</b> in deterministic growth models. We aimed at two things in this dissertation.

A {{better understanding of the}} role <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> in growth processes helped us to identify (and hopefully to fill-up) gaps in the field of economic modeling and to use these findings to raise new questions. Second, we intended to initiate background work for analyzing the growth implications <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> in a taxonomy. The issue <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> has clearly not been analyzed sufficiently and systematically in the (deterministic) growth literature, even if many studies used some notion <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> in their analysis in one way or another.
