6000|$|Sir Henry Maine {{believes}} that the air is thick with ideas about democracy that were conceived a priori, and that sprung from the teaching of Rousseau. A conviction {{of the advantages of}} legislative change, for example, he considers to owe its origin much less to active and original intelligence, than to [...] "the remote effect of words and notions derived from broken-down political theories." [...] There are two great fountains of political theory in our country according to the author: Rousseau is one, and Bentham is the other. Current thought and speech Is infested by the floating fragments of these two systems--by loose phrases, by vague notions, by superstitions, that enervate the human intellect and endanger social safety. This is the constant refrain of the pages before us. We should have liked better evidence. We do not believe that it is a Roman praetorium. Men often pick up old phrases for new events, even when they are judging events afresh with independent minds. When a politician of the day speaks of natural rights, he uses a loose <b>traditional</b> <b>expression</b> for a view of social equities which has come to him, not from a book, but from a survey of certain existing social facts. Now the phrase, the literary description, is the least significant part of the matter. When Mr. Mill talks of the influence of Bentham's writings, he is careful to tell us that he {{does not mean that they}} caused the Reform Bill or the Appropriation Clause. [...] "The changes which have been made," [...] says Mill, [...] "and the greater changes which will be made, in our institutions are not the work of philosophers, but of the interests and instincts of large portions of society recently grown into strength" [...] (Dissertations, i. 332). That is the point. It is the action of these interests and instincts which Sir Henry Maine habitually overlooks. For is the omission a mere speculative imperfection. It has an important bearing on the whole practical drift of the book. If he had made more room for [...] "the common intellect rough-hewing political truths at the suggestion of common wants and common experience," [...] he would have viewed existing circumstances with a less lively apprehension.|$|E
