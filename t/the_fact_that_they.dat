In the principle legislative assembly, the Plebeian Council, any individual voted in the Tribe that his ancestors had belonged to. Thus, most of these newly unemployed Plebeians belonged to one of the thirty-one rural Tribes, rather than one of the four urban Tribes, and the unemployed Plebeians soon acquired so much political power that the Plebeian Council became highly populist. These Plebeians were often angry with the aristocracy, which further exacerbated the class tensions. Their economic state usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered the most for them, or at least for the candidate whose games or whose bribes were the most magnificent. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were usually uninformed as to the issues before them didn't matter, because they usually sold their votes to the highest bidder anyway. Bribery became such a problem that major reforms were ultimately passed, in particular the requirement that all votes be by secret ballot. A new culture of dependency was emerging, which would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E

40|$|Neurotrophins are {{important}} in inflammation. In an article in Arthritis Research & Therapy, Barthel and collaborators give new information {{on the existence of}} neurotrophin production in the synovial tissue of arthritic joints. These findings, together with other recent findings, stress that neurotrophins should be considered important factors in arthritis. This is reinforced by <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are also produced by articular chondrocytes and that receptors for these are present in the synovial tissue and on chondrocytes. The importance of neurotrophins in joints should be further studied, including examinations on the efficacy of interfering with their effects in arthritis...|$|R
40|$|The {{heart of}} this essay is a small study of four {{investigation}} reports, two from Holland and two from the United States.

From <b>the</b> perspective of a manager that {{made a decision that}} proved to be disastrous we’ll explain {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} these approaches for learning. From the perspective of the investigator we’ll explain the logic of these approaches. Confronting both perspectives with each other explains why it is so hard for managers to learn from investigation reports...|$|R

The winner gains new Coins, and gets to narrate the result of the Challenge.|$|R
