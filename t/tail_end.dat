5|$|Many {{fish have}} eyespots near their tails, {{a form of}} automimicry, to {{distract}} attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye.

5|$|Tropical Depression Ten {{formed from}} the complex {{interaction}} between an upper-level low, a tropical wave that produced Tropical Storm Ingrid, and the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> {{of a cold}} front. By September17, the system produced widespread thunderstorm activity over The Bahamas and western Atlantic Ocean. The upper-level low over the Florida Panhandle increased convection across the area, and on September18 the system began crossing Florida. Initially very disorganized, surface pressures gradually decreased across the region, with a weak low-pressure area developing on September19.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm {{was believed to}} have formed from a low-pressure area, possibly on the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> of a cold front on October 14. The storm moved westward; however, it began to curve west-southwestward on October 15, as it reached its peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). The storm continued to trek towards the west-southwest on October 16, later making landfall in eastern Florida on October 17 as a tropical depression. No damage {{is known to have}} been caused by the {{tropical storm}}.|$|E
5|$|A warm {{seclusion}} is {{the mature}} {{phase of the}} extratropical cyclone lifecycle. This was conceptualized after the ERICA field experiment of the late 1980s, which produced observations of intense marine cyclones that indicated an anomalously warm low-level thermal structure, secluded (or surrounded) by a bent-back warm front and a coincident chevron-shaped band of intense surface winds. The Norwegian Cyclone Model, as developed by the Bergen School of Meteorology, largely observed cyclones at the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> of their lifecycle and used the term occlusion to identify the decaying stages.|$|E

The tornado path width was estimated to be approximately 1/8 to 1/4mile wide. Significant damage was reported at the Wauka Valley Farms facility. Hundreds of trees were uprooted, and two barns were completely destroyed. One structure sustained room damage and a number of trees and power lines were also down along Town Creek road. Overall, in excess of 200 trees were down in the southwest part of the county.|$|E

5|$|The {{adults of}} some Australian cicada {{are subject to}} a cicada-specific fungus from the genus Massospora, which grows on their {{genitalia}} and abdominal cavity, eventually causing the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> to drop off. Australian cicadas are further preyed on by the cicada killer wasp (Exeirus lateritius), which stings and paralyses cicadas high in the trees. Their victims drop to the ground where the cicada-hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its hind legs, sometimes over a distance of 100m (330ft). They are then shoved into the hunter's burrow, where the helpless cicada is placed on a shelf in an often extensive 'catacomb', to form food-stock for the wasp grub growing from the eggs deposited within.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Ten was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone that made landfall on the Florida Panhandle in September2007. The system {{developed as a}} subtropical depression on September21 in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico from the interaction of a tropical wave, the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> of a cold front, and an upper-level low. Initially containing a poorly defined circulation and intermittent thunderstorm activity, the system transitioned into a tropical depression after convection increased over the center. Tracking northwestward, the depression moved ashore near Fort Walton Beach early on September22 and dissipated over southeastern Alabama shortly thereafter.|$|E

40|$|We used rotary-shadowing {{electron}} microscopy {{to map the}} calmodulin-and actin-binding sites on the brain spectrin, calspectin (or fodrin). Calspectin dimers appeared as rods 110 nm long and joined in a head-to- head manner to form tetramers 220 nm long. We determined calmodulin- binding sites by a ferritin-labeling method combined with biotin-avidin complex formation. Ferritin particles were found to attach to the head parts of calspectin dimers at a position 10 - 20 nm {{from the top of}} the head. The number of the calmodulin-binding sites seemed to be only one for each dimer and two for each tetramer. In contrast, the actin- binding sites were localized at the <b>tail</b> <b>ends</b> of the calspectin molecules. The tetramers attached to muscle F-actin with their <b>tail</b> <b>ends</b> and often cross-linked adjacent filaments. The results are discussed in view of the analogy to the erythrocyte spectrin...|$|R
5|$|Because {{the tail}} {{had at least}} forty caudal vertebrae, it was highly mobile. It could {{possibly}} swing at an arc of 180 degrees, covering the entire half circle behind it. Swing speeds at the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> may have been as high as 50km/h. Continuous rapid swings would have allowed the spikes to slash open the skin of its attacker or to stab the soft tissues and break the ribs or facial bones. More directed blows {{would have resulted in}} the sides of the spikes fracturing even sturdy longbones of the legs by blunt trauma. These attacks would have crippled small and medium-sized theropods and may even have done some damage to large ones. Earlier interpretations of the defensive behaviour of Kentrosaurus included the suggestion that the animal might have charged to the rear, to run through attackers with its spines, in the way of modern porcupines.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{radical and}} unusual shape, the {{airframe}} was built along traditional lines. Except {{for the most}} highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy. The airframe was broken down {{into a number of}} major assemblies: the centre section, a rectangular box containing the bomb-bay and engine bays bounded by the front and rear spars and the wing transport joints; the intakes and centre fuselage; the front fuselage, incorporating the pressure cabin; the nose; the outer wings; the leading edges; the wing trailing edge and <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> of the fuselage; the wings were not sealed and used directly as fuel tankage, but carried bladders for fuel in the void spaces of the wings; and there was a single swept tail fin with a single rudder on the trailing edge.|$|E

He then played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, Detroit Lions, and Pittsburgh Steelers before spending his final season in the American Football League (AFL) with the Houston Oilers. Commonly referred to as simply John Henry, an allusion to the folk hero of the same name, Johnson was a tough and tenacious player who performed {{at a high level}} well into the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> of his career.|$|E
