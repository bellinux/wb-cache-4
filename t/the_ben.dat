5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ben</b> Franklin Bridge {{was opened}} on July 1, 1926 and was {{designated}} to carry US 30 across the Delaware River. A parkway called the Camden-Atlantic City Parkway was planned in 1932 to connect <b>the</b> <b>Ben</b> Franklin Bridge southeast to Atlantic City; this was never built. After World War II, freeway connections were planned {{on both sides}} of <b>the</b> <b>Ben</b> Franklin Bridge. In Philadelphia, the Vine Street Expressway was planned to run along the Vine Street corridor to the present-day Schuylkill Expressway in 1945. The North-South Freeway was proposed in New Jersey as a connection from the bridge south along the Route 42 corridor. In 1950, the city of Philadelphia began planning the construction of the Vine Street Expressway, which would run along a depressed alignment through the city.|$|E

5|$|The NorthSouth Freeway {{portion of}} Route 42 was {{originally}} planned as a parkway in 1932 that would run from <b>the</b> <b>Ben</b> Franklin Bridge in Camden to Atlantic City; however, this proposal never materialized. In the late 1940s, the NorthSouth Freeway was {{proposed by the}} New Jersey State Highway Department to run from <b>the</b> <b>Ben</b> Franklin Bridge to Turnersville. In the early 1950s, right-of-way for the freeway was acquired and actual construction of the freeway followed. The Route 42 freeway opened between Interstate 295 in Bellmawr and the Black Horse Pike in Blackwood in 1958. It opened between the Black Horse Pike in Blackwood and Turnersville in 1959. With {{the completion of the}} NorthSouth Freeway portion of Route 42, the Black Horse Pike north of Turnersville became Route 168.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, freeway {{approaches}} {{were planned}} {{for both sides}} of <b>the</b> <b>Ben</b> Franklin Bridge, which was completed in 1926 {{and served as a}} part of US 30. In Pennsylvania, the Vine Street Expressway was planned to run along the northern edge of Center City Philadelphia to the Schuylkill River, while in New Jersey, the North-South Freeway was to head south along the Route 42 corridor. When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s, this stretch of highway was a part of I-80S, with Interstate 680 continuing on the Schuylkill Expressway to the Walt Whitman Bridge. In 1964, the designations became I-76 and I-676, respectively, and in 1972 the two routes were switched onto their current alignments. I-676 in New Jersey was completed between I-76 and Morgan Boulevard by 1960 and north of there to downtown Camden by the 1980s. The Vine Street Expressway was opened from the Schuylkill Expressway to 18th Street by 1960 and east of there to I-95 on January 10, 1991 after several obstacles to construction. However, there are grade-level intersections in the connections between the Vine Street Expressway and <b>the</b> <b>Ben</b> Franklin Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In 1166 Maimonides went to Egypt {{and settled}} in Fustat, where he gained much renown as a physician, practising in the family of Saladin and in that of his vizier Ḳaḍi al-Faḍil al-Baisami, and Saladin's successors. The title Ra'is al-Umma or al-Millah (Head of the Nation or of the Faith), was {{bestowed}} upon him. In Fustat, he wrote his Mishneh Torah (1180) and The Guide for the Perplexed. Some of his writings were later discovered among the manuscript fragments in the geniza (storeroom) of <b>the</b> <b>Ben</b> Ezra Synagogue, located in Fustat.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, which {{eliminated}} several concurrencies between U.S. and state routes, the designations of routes 25, 43, and 56 {{were removed from}} US30. Prior to the completion of I-676 across <b>the</b> <b>Ben</b> Franklin Bridge in the 1970s, US30 used Penn Street eastbound and Linden Street westbound to travel between the bridge and Admiral Wilson Boulevard. In the late 1960s, a freeway was proposed for US30 in Camden County by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission. The freeway, which was to cost $40million, was to run from <b>the</b> <b>Ben</b> Franklin Bridge to I-295 in Barrington with a $16million extension to the planned Route90 freeway in Berlin. The segment between Camden and Barrington was to be complete by 1975 while the extension to Berlin was to be finished by 1985. However, the NJDOT did not build this US30 freeway. In 2009, the Collingswood Circle at {{the eastern end of}} the US130 concurrency was replaced with an at-grade intersection with jughandles.|$|E

5|$|The Glamis road {{opened in}} August 1958, {{and the road}} from Glamis to Palo Verde was under {{construction}} at that time; {{the part of the}} road that was already open was dedicated in October. In 1959, the rest of the current routing of SR78 between Brawley and Palo Verde was added to the state highway system as SR195 and Legislative Route 146. The state legislature added the portion of SR78 from SR115 to the Riverside County line in the 1964 state highway renumbering, also naming the road <b>the</b> <b>Ben</b> Hulse Highway. In March 1964, <b>the</b> <b>Ben</b> Hulse Highway leading to Palo Verde was dedicated, and state senator Hulse's efforts to have the road built were recognized. Following this, in 1965, the newly constructed section was signed as CRS78. The section from Palo Verde to Blythe shows up as part of SR78 on maps as early as 1965, and the section from southwest of Midway Well to Palo Verde is shown as part of SR78 as early as 1966.|$|E

The PFLP and the Japanese Red Army carried out a shooting rampage at the same airport, killing twenty-four civilians. Israel later claimed that the assassination of PFLP spokesman Ghassan Kanafani {{was a response to}} the PFLP's involvement in masterminding the latter attack. Two days later, various PLO factions retaliated by bombing a bus station, killing eleven civilians.|$|E

This expedition, led by Frederick George Jackson and financed by newspaper magnate Alfred Harmsworth, had left London in 1894. It was engaged in a detailed survey of the Franz Josef archipelago, which had been discovered, though not properly mapped, during an Austrian expedition 20years earlier. Jackson's party was based at Cape Flora on Northbrook Island, the southernmost island of the archipelago. It was supplied through regular visits from its expedition ship Windward, on which Bruce sailed from London on 9 June 1896.|$|E
