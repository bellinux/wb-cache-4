5|$|The Clear Lake Area {{includes}} numerous {{communities and}} municipalities surrounding Clear Lake between Pasadena, Houston, and the bay.Barrington (2008), p. 225–235.Abbott (2003), p. 23 This area largely owes its recent growth and prosperity {{directly and indirectly}} to <b>the</b> <b>Johnson</b> <b>Space</b> Center, and has been traditionally characterized by a large white collar workforce and its prolific middle- and upper-middle-class neighborhoods. The area is sometimes seen as {{the heart of the}} Bay Area in spite of the relative youth of its history.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the region {{gave birth to}} some of the state's {{earliest}} oil fields and refineries as the Texas Oil Boom took hold. Refining and manufacturing grew rapidly in the area, particularly around Baytown, Pasadena, and Texas City. The opening of the Port of Texas City, and later Barbours Cut and Bayport, gradually established the region as an important shipping center. As wealth increased in southeast Texas, resorts and other tourist draws developed in the Bay Area. During the 1960s the area became home of <b>the</b> <b>Johnson</b> <b>Space</b> Center, headquarters for the nation's manned space program, which helped diversify the regional economy and began the development of an aerospace industry, and later other high-tech industries.|$|E
5|$|While filming in Washington, D.C., {{the crew}} {{shot on the}} National Mall, and Bay stated {{that there would be}} a car race on the location. Two further {{locations}} announced were the Milwaukee Art Museum and the former Tower Automotive complex on Milwaukee's north side, then under redevelopment for mixed use as well as the city's equipment yard. Filming was scheduled to take place there after work was done in Chicago. On September 23, scenes were filmed at the former city hall in Detroit. On October 16, a scene in the later-1960s was shot at <b>the</b> <b>Johnson</b> <b>Space</b> Center in Houston, utilizing extras with period fashion and hairstyles. One day of shooting was also spent at the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia. Other planned filming locations included Africa and China. Though about 70% of the film's live action footage was shot in 3-D using Arri Alexa and Sony F35 cameras, more than half of the film still had to be converted into 3-D in post production to fix technical flaws 3-D filming produces. Other footage that needed to be converted into 3-D in post production was either entirely computer generated or shot in the anamorphic format on 35mm film. 35mm film was used for scenes filmed in slow motion and scenes such as closeups of faces or shots of the sky which required higher image quality than the HD digital 3-D cameras could provide. 35mm cameras were also used for scenes where the 3-D cameras proved to be too heavy, or were subject to strobing or electrical damage from dust. Principal photography officially concluded on November 9, 2010.|$|E
