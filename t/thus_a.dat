5|$|Helium leaks through cracks {{should not}} be {{confused}} with gas permeation through a bulk material. While helium has documented permeation constants (<b>thus</b> <b>a</b> calculable permeation rate) through glasses, ceramics, and synthetic materials, inert gases such as helium will not permeate most bulk metals.|$|E

5|$|<b>Thus,</b> <b>a</b> {{political}} wire-puller such as Grigori Rasputin enjoys power {{best when}} playing off another person's hereditary power, {{or when the}} organisation benefits largely from an air of mystery.

5|$|White was the {{grandson}} of Virginia pioneer settler and physician Dr.Robert White (1688–1752) and <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> member of the prominent White political family of Virginia and West Virginia.

5|$|Although Christ, like man, {{is made in}} {{the image}} of God, he alone shares the {{likeness}} of God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and thus by striving to imitate Christ, man can achieve salvation. To Clement, sin is involuntary, and thus irrational , removed only through the wisdom of the Logos. God's guidance of us away from sin is <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on λόγος and αλόγον is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the Epicurean belief that relationships between words are deeply reflective of relationships between the objects they signify.|$|E
5|$|Although the Thames {{had been}} defended from naval attack since Henry VIII's time, when five blockhouses were built {{as part of}} the Device Forts chain of coastal defences, there were no {{equivalents}} on the Medway. Two medieval castles – Rochester Castle and Queenborough Castle – existed along the river's south bank, but both were intended to defend landward approaches and were of little use for defence. There was <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> pressing need for proper defences to protect the vulnerable ships and shore facilities on the upper Medway.|$|E

5|$|Every {{new term}} greater than million is one million {{times larger than}} the {{previous}} term. <b>Thus,</b> billion means <b>a</b> millionmillions (1012), trillion means a millionbillions (1018), and so on. <b>Thus,</b> <b>an</b> n-illion equals 106n.|$|R
5|$|As {{discussed}} above, any non-pseudoforest graph contains as a subgraph a handcuff, {{figure 8}}, or theta graph; any handcuff or figure 8 graph may be contracted {{to form a}} butterfly graph (five-vertex figure 8), and any theta graph may be contracted to form a diamond graph (four-vertex theta graph), so any non-pseudoforest contains either a butterfly or a diamond as a minor, {{and these are the}} only minor-minimal non-pseudoforest graphs. <b>Thus,</b> <b>a</b> graph is a pseudoforest if and only if it does not have the butterfly or the diamond as a minor. If one forbids only the diamond but not the butterfly, the resulting larger graph family consists of the cactus graphs and disjoint unions of multiple cactus graphs.|$|E
5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. <b>Thus</b> <b>a</b> fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|Attribution {{is often}} {{difficult}} with Farsari's photographs because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' images and sold them under their own names. This {{may be due to}} the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due to the number of freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio. <b>Thus</b> <b>a</b> photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. A case in point is the photograph of an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|E

5|$|Augustine consecrated Justus as {{a bishop}} in 604, over a {{province}} including the Kentish town of Rochester. The historian Nicholas Brooks {{argues that the}} choice of Rochester was probably not {{because it had been}} a Roman-era bishopric, but rather because of its importance in the politics of the time. Although the town was small, with just one street, it was at the junction of Watling Street and the estuary of the Medway, and was <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> fortified town. Because Justus was probably not a monk (he was not called that by Bede), his cathedral clergy was very likely non-monastic too.|$|E
5|$|By that time, {{the land}} once held in common by the Székely {{community}} had gradually become divided into {{smaller and smaller}} units; <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> vast number of the free warrior-peasants had to enter the service of their more prosperous fellow Székelys. This social stratification was formally recognized by a royal decree in 1473. Thereafter those who performed mounted military service were differentiated from those who fought as foot-soldiers; those who were unable to finance themselves even as foot-soldiers were legally reduced to servitude.|$|E
5|$|Canada is a {{multilingual}} {{and multicultural}} society home {{to people of}} many different ethnic, religious and national origins, {{with the majority of}} the population made up of Old World immigrants and their descendants. Following the initial period of French and then the much larger British colonization, different waves (or peaks) of immigration and settlement of non-indigenous peoples took place over the course of nearly two centuries and continue today. Elements of Indigenous, French, British, and more recent immigrant customs, languages and religions have combined to form the culture of Canada and <b>thus</b> <b>a</b> Canadian identity. Canada has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the United States.|$|E
