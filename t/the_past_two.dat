5|$|Wetting is {{the ability}} of a liquid to {{maintain}} contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting (wettability) is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Wetting deals with the three phases of materials: gas, liquid, and solid.

5|$|According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian {{economy in}} 2017 was {{nominally}} worth US$2.454 trillion; {{it is the}} sixth-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is, at US$9.489 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity, or PPP. With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–12, India {{is one of the}} world's fastest-growing economies. However, the country ranks 140th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 129th in GDP per capita at PPP. Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy; since then it has slowly moved towards a free-market system by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows. India {{has been a member of}} WTO since 1 January 1995.|$|E
5|$|At first, human {{activity}} had not posed a significant {{threat to the}} Puerto Rican amazon. The Taíno hunted the parrot but without much effect on its population. In <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> hundred years, however, many factors {{have led to a}} drastic decrease in the birds' numbers: agricultural development, the construction of roads, hydroelectric development, and the adoption of young chicks as pets. Especially during {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, most of Puerto Rico's virgin forests, a historical habitat of the species, were cleared for agricultural development, primarily for the production of sugar, cotton, corn and rice. The amazon quickly came to rely on these crops as its main food source and so became seen as a pest; local farmers repelled or hunted the bird if possible. As agriculture expanded, the amazon's habitat disappeared further and its population declined.|$|E

Manager Laurent Blanc later stated that Gourcuff had lacked confidence since returning from his injury following Gourcuff's second penalty miss of the season in the club's midweek 1–0 victory over Montpellier on 16 November. However, three days later, Gourcuff returned to form scoring a goal and providing the assists on the other three goals in Bordeaux's 4–1 win over Lorient. On 20 December, he was declared by magazine France Football the French Player of the Year for 2009 beating out the likes of Nicolas Anelka, Hugo Lloris, Thierry Henry, and Franck Ribéry; the latter having won the award <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> seasons prior.|$|E

John Leeds Barroll argues in his cultural biography of Anne that her political interventions in Scotland were more significant, and certainly more troublesome, than previously noticed; and Clare McManus, among other cultural historians, has highlighted Anne's influential role in the Jacobean cultural flowering, not only as a patron of writers and artists but as a performer herself.|$|E
5|$|In Lightning Returns, Hope {{resides in}} a special base {{constructed}} within the new Cocoon called the Ark, communicating with Lightning via a wireless com-link. Hope is returned to his 14-year-old image and stripped of his emotions by Bhunivelze, but retains his memories from <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> games. He is instrumental in keeping the world going, for as Lightning completes quests and fulfills missions, he uses energy generated from those acts to prolong the world's life. On the final day, Hope reveals that he acted as Bhunivelze's eyes and ears, and will now be disposed of. Bhunivelze then uses Hope as an avatar, speaking with Lightning and capturing her allies. During the final battle Lightning frees him from Bhunivelze's control, then Hope aids her in defeating Bhunivelze for good.|$|E

5|$|José Antonio Camacho led Benfica {{to another}} second-place finish and broke an eight-year title drought; he {{attracted}} interest from Real Madrid, who signed him in late May. As a replacement, Benfica unsuccessfully inquired after Luiz Felipe Scolari for the position. After much speculation, Benfica announced they had recruited Giovanni Trapattoni, the Italian national team's former manager. Benfica signed more players than the year before, but only Quim, Manuel dos Santos and Azar Karadas became regular first-team fixtures. The most significant departure {{was that of}} Tiago, {{who had been a}} regular for <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> seasons. Because their second-place finish only granted a place in the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, Benfica had to play Anderlecht for a place in the group stage. A 3–1 loss on aggregate led to relegation to the 2004–05 UEFA Cup. Between both legs, Benfica contested and lost the 2004 Supercup with Porto.|$|E
5|$|Leopard Trek {{came to the}} Tour de France with, per season-long expectations, a squad {{centered}} around overall victory. The leader was probably Andy Schleck, entering as runner-up in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> Tours de France and three-times running winner of the young rider classification, an award {{for which he was}} no longer eligible. Brother Fränk said his goal was to have Andy win the Tour, with Fränk himself also there on the podium with him. The remaining squad members were Cancellara, Gerdemann, Monfort, Fuglsang, Voigt, O'Grady, and Posthuma. Every rider on the squad had ridden the Tour de France before, and all but Monfort, Fuglsang, and Posthuma had previously worn the yellow jersey. Pre-race analysis speculated Cancellara could aim for a few days in the race lead before the course shifted to the high mountains.|$|E

Former Tour de France points classification winner Óscar Freire intended to make his Giro debut in this race, but he pulled out due to sinusitis shortly before the race started. Other sprinters in the Giro peloton included Robbie McEwen, Freire's teammate Graeme Brown, Baden Cooke, Leonardo Duque, Sebastian Haedo, Wouter Weylandt, and Greg Henderson.|$|E
