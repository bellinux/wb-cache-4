They're exactly wrong. There had been no reelected Republican majority since 1928. Part of <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>we</b> got reelected... is our base thought we were serious. And they thought we were serious because when it came to a show-down, we didn't flinch." [...] In a 2011 op-ed in The Washington Post, Gingrich said that the government shutdown led to the balanced-budget deal in 1997 and the first four consecutive balanced budgets since the 1920s, as well as the first re-election of a Republican majority since 1928.|$|E

Arthur later stated that, [...] "I meant to make as big a fuss as I possibly could with the object of getting the position corrected...

One of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>we</b> may give for our design acts is that they are following a rule. For a design act to be following a rule, there must be a fit between the rule and what we do in practice. For a design act to be about construction, a form act, there must be a fit between the form act and what gets done in the field. by Ellen Saslaw. Thesis (M. Arch.)

40|$|In {{defending}} {{the principle of}} neutrality, liberals have often appealed to a more general moral principle that forbids coercing persons in <b>the</b> name of <b>reasons</b> those persons themselves cannot reasonably be expected to share. Yet liberals have struggled to articulate a non-arbitrary, non- dogmatic distinction between <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> that persons can reasonably be expected to share and those they cannot. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> for this, I argue, {{is that what it}} means to “share a reason” is itself obscure. In this paper I articulate two different conceptions of what it is to share a reason; I call these conceptions “foundationalist” and “constructivist. ” On the foundationalist view, two people “share” a <b>reason</b> just in <b>the</b> sense that <b>the</b> same <b>reason</b> applies to each of them independently. On this view, I argue, debates about <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>we</b> share collapse into debates about <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>we</b> have, moving us no closer to an adequate defense of neutrality. On the constructivist view, by contrast, “sharing reasons” is understood as a kind of activity, and <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>we</b> must share are just those reasons that make this activity possible. I argue that the constructivist conception of sharing reasons yields a better defense of the principle of neutrality...|$|R

Furthermore, the game had to be recoded to change optimizations that were made for the PlayStation 2 version; Svensson stated that [...] "part of <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>we</b> didn't show it until we started showing it was because, if we showed it {{in a form that}} was anything less than near-perfect, people were going to freak out". Ready at Dawn's creative director Ru Weerasuriya later reflected that porting Ōkami to the Wii was a challenging task—"we started with no assets and literally reverse-engineered the whole thing back onto the Wii"—they did out of love for the game, but the level of effort would preclude them from attempting such a port again.|$|E

And then they sort of said, 'Well, look, here’s the deal.

[...] "I was on the fence a little bit, even while shooting it. And I think Matt finally was like, 'Look man, we’re not jerking you around here.
