5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> mercury exposure, {{industrial}} and commercial uses are regulated in many countries.

5|$|An {{immediate}} concern of environmentalists was the potential {{use of chemical}} dispersants. To keep big slicks from washing ashore, dispersants {{can be used to}} break the oil into small droplets that disperse throughout the water column. There are significant concerns about <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> the dispersants and the effects on aquatic life. Coast Guard officials overseeing the cleanup indicated that no chemical dispersants were being used but did not immediately rule the use of them out.|$|E

40|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{is expected to}} produce secondary mental <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> that may increase suicide and alcohol death rates. However, <b>the</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{economic crisis}} can be offset by social welfare and other policy measures. For example, active labour market programmes aimed at helping people retain or regain jobs counteract <b>the</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic crisis. Family support programmes contribute to counteracting <b>the</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crisis. Increasing alcohol prices and restricting alcohol availability reduce the harmful <b>effects</b> on mental <b>health</b> and save lives. Debt relief programmes will help to reduce <b>the</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic crisis and accessible and responsive primary care services support people at risk and prevent mental <b>health</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R

5|$|The main active {{ingredient}} of beer is alcohol, and therefore, <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> alcohol apply to beer.

The long term health effects of continuous, moderate or heavy alcohol consumption include the risk of developing alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease.|$|E
5|$|The smog catalyzed greater {{national}} {{awareness of}} air pollution as a serious health problem and political issue. New York City updated its local laws on air pollution control. Prompted by the smog, President Lyndon B. Johnson and members of Congress worked to pass federal legislation regulating air pollution in the United States, culminating in the 1967 Air Quality Act and the 1970 Clean Air Act. The 1966 smog is a milestone that has been compared with other pollution events, including <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> pollution from the September 11 attacks and pollution in China.|$|E

40|$|The {{claim that}} <b>the</b> adverse <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> {{cannabis}} {{are much less}} serious than those of alcohol has been central to the case for cannabis legalisation. Regulators in US states that have legalised cannabis have adopted regulatory models based on alcohol. This paper critically examines the claim about adverse <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> and <b>the</b> wisdom <b>of</b> regulating cannabis like alcohol. First, it compares {{what we know about}} <b>the</b> adverse <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> alcohol and cannabis. Second, it discusses the uncertainties about <b>the</b> long term <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> sustained daily cannabis use. Third, it speculates about how <b>the</b> adverse <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> cannabis may change after legalisation. Fourth, it questions the assumption that alcohol provides the best regulatory model for a legal cannabis market. Fifth, it outlines the major challenges in regulating cannabis under the liberal alcohol-like regulatory regimes now being introduced...|$|R
5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{of less than}} 10 µm diameter suspended in the air {{are known to be}} inhalable, and people exposed to ash falls have experienced respiratory discomfort, breathing difficulty, eye and skin irritation, and nose and throat symptoms. Most of these effects are short-term and are not considered to pose a significant health risk to those without pre-existing respiratory conditions. <b>The</b> <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> volcanic ash depend on the grain size, mineralogical composition and chemical coatings {{on the surface of the}} ash particles. Additional factors related to potential respiratory symptoms are the frequency and duration of exposure, the concentration of ash in the air and the respirable ash fraction; the proportion of ash with less than 10µm diameter, known as PM10. The social context may also be important.|$|E

Aimed at increasing awareness, sharing information and co-ordinating responses to reduce <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> heat on vulnerable populations, the action plan is the first comprehensive plan in Asia to address the threat of adverse heat on health. It also focuses on community participation, building public awareness of the risks of extreme heat, training medical and community workers to respond to and help prevent heat-related illnesses, and co-ordinating an interagency emergency response effort when heat waves hit.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, {{scientists}} with the U.S. Public Health Service published reports about radioactivity released from Hanford, {{and there were}} protests from the health departments of Oregon and Washington. In response to {{an article in the}} Spokane Spokesman Review in September 1985, the Department of Energy announced to declassify environmental records and, in February 1986, released 19,000pages of previously unavailable historical documents about Hanford's operations. The Washington State Department of Health collaborated with the citizen-led Hanford Health Information Network (HHIN) to publicize data about <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> Hanford's operations. HHIN reports concluded that residents who lived downwind from Hanford or who used the Columbia River downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them at increased risk for various cancers and other diseases. A mass tort lawsuit brought by two thousand Hanford downwinders against the federal government has been in the court system for many years. Two of six plaintiffs who went to trial in 2005 were awarded $500,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|In several Western {{countries}} it {{has been}} seen that absences due to sickness for women are far greater than men. When investigating the reasons behind this, a study done in Sweden published in 1996 found {{that half of the}} difference between genders can be dismissed if you take out the days missed by pregnant women. When taking into account <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> double burden, child birth is always a possibility for mothers who already are faced with taking care of children and having a career and effects them and their health. In many studies people have tried to relate the difference in sickness absences directly to the double burden effect. It has been somewhat successful as women who are faced with work and child care have been known to request more sick days than men in the same situation. Additionally, working wives with children have twice the absence rate as men who are placed in the same position in work family conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{was first}} {{observed}} to be radioactive in 1898, by the German chemist Gerhard Carl Schmidt and later that year, independently, by the Polish-French physicist Marie Curie. It {{was the second}} element that {{was found to be}} radioactive, after the 1896 discovery of radioactivity in uranium by French physicist Henri Becquerel. Between 1900 and 1903, British physicists Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements. This observation led to the identification of the half-life as one of the outcomes of the alpha particle experiments that led to their disintegration theory of radioactivity. The biological effect of radiation was discovered in 1903. The newly discovered phenomenon of radioactivity excited scientists and the general public alike. In the 1920s, thorium's radioactivity was promoted as a cure for rheumatism, diabetes, and sexual impotence. In 1932, most of these uses were banned in the United States after a federal investigation into <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> radioactivity. Public interest in radioactivity had declined {{by the end of the}} 1930s.|$|E
