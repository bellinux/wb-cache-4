5|$|June 2: Construction begins of K-25, <b>the</b> <b>gaseous</b> {{diffusion}} plant.|$|E
5|$|Construction began before {{completion}} of the design for <b>the</b> <b>gaseous</b> diffusion process. Due to {{the large amount of}} electric power that the K-25 plant was expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own electric power plant. While the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) believed that it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about relying on a single supplier when a power failure could cost <b>the</b> <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plant weeks of work, and the lines to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure. The Kellex engineers were also attracted to the idea of being able to generate the variable frequency current required by <b>the</b> <b>gaseous</b> diffusion process without complicated transformers.|$|E

500|$|Construction of the K-25 {{facility}} was undertaken [...] by J.A. Jones Construction. At {{the height of}} construction, over 25,000 workers were employed on <b>the</b> site. <b>Gaseous</b> diffusion was but one of three enrichment technologies used by the Manhattan Project. Slightly enriched product from the S-50 thermal diffusion plant was fed into <b>the</b> K-25 <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plant. Its product in turn was fed into the Y-12 electromagnetic plant. The enriched uranium {{was used in the}} Little Boy atomic bomb used in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. In 1946, <b>the</b> K-25 <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plant became capable of producing highly enriched product.|$|R

5|$|On 26 May 1943, Oliphant {{wrote to}} Appleton {{to say that}} he had been {{considering}} the problem of electromagnetic isotope separation, and believed that he had devised a better method than Lawrence's, one which would result in a five to tenfold improvement in efficiency, and make it more practical to use the process in Britain. His proposal was reviewed by Akers, Chadwick, Peierls and Simon, who agreed that it was sound. While the majority of scientific opinion in Britain favoured <b>the</b> <b>gaseous</b> diffusion method, there was still a possibility that electromagnetic separation might be useful as a final stage in the enrichment process, taking uranium that had already been enriched to 50 per cent by <b>the</b> <b>gaseous</b> process, and enriching it to pure uranium-235. Accordingly, Oliphant was released from the radar project to work on Tube Alloys, conducting experiments on his method at the University of Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|Production {{commenced}} in February 1945, and {{the first}} product was shipped to the calutrons in March. By April, <b>the</b> <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plant was producing 1.1 percent product. It was then decided that instead of processing uranium hexafluoride feed from the Harshaw Chemical Company, <b>the</b> <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plant would take {{the product of the}} S-50 thermal diffusion plant, with an average enrichment of about 0.85 percent. Product enrichment continued to improve, as more stages came online and performed better than anticipated. In June product was being enriched to 7 percent; by September it was 23 percent. The S-50 plant ceased operation on 9 September, and Kellex transferred the last unit to Union Carbide on 11 September 1945. Highly enriched uranium was used in the Little Boy atomic bomb used in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945.|$|E

50|$|Before its {{downsizing}} {{and final}} cessation of uranium enrichment on May 31, 2013, <b>the</b> Paducah <b>Gaseous</b> Diffusion Plant consumed about 3,000 {{megawatts of electricity}} at peak operation. Power for <b>the</b> Paducah <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plant came from the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).

5|$|Boranes are {{chemical}} compounds of boron and hydrogen, with the generic formula of BxHy. These compounds {{do not occur}} in nature. Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air, some violently. The parent member BH3 is called borane, but it is known only in <b>the</b> <b>gaseous</b> state, and dimerises to form diborane, B2H6. The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral, some of which exist as isomers. For example, isomers of B20H26 {{are based on the}} fusion of two 10-atom clusters.|$|E
5|$|By March 1943 Conant {{decided that}} British help would benefit {{some areas of}} the project. In particular, the Manhattan Project could benefit enough from {{assistance}} from James Chadwick, the discoverer of the neutron, and one or two other British scientists to warrant the risk of revealing weapon design secrets. Bush, Conant and Groves wanted Chadwick and Peierls to discuss bomb design with Robert Oppenheimer, and Kellogg still wanted British comments on the design of <b>the</b> <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plant.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, Urey {{brought in}} Hugh S. Taylor from Princeton University {{to look at}} the problem of a usable barrier. Libby made {{progress}} on understanding the chemistry of uranium hexafluoride, leading to ideas on how to prevent corrosion and plugging. Chemical researchers at the SAM Laboratories studied fluorocarbons, which resisted corrosion, and could be used as lubricants and coolants in <b>the</b> <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plant. Despite this progress, the K-25 Project was in serious trouble without a suitable barrier, and by August 1943 it was facing cancellation. On 13 August Groves informed the Military Policy Committee, the senior committee that steered the Manhattan Project, that gaseous diffusion enrichment in excess of 50 percent was probably infeasible, and that <b>the</b> <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plant would be limited to producing product with a lower enrichment that could be fed into the calutrons of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant. Urey therefore began preparations to mass-produce the Norris-Adler barrier, despite its problems.|$|E

5|$|Like solid bromine and iodine, solid {{chlorine}} crystallises in the orthorhombic crystal system, in a layered lattice of Cl2 molecules.

This structure means that chlorine {{is a very}} poor conductor of electricity, and indeed its conductivity is so low as to be practically unmeasurable.|$|E
5|$|Like solid {{chlorine}} and iodine, solid bromine crystallises in the orthorhombic crystal system, in a layered lattice of Br2 molecules. The Br–Br {{distance is}} 227pm (close to <b>the</b> <b>gaseous</b> Br–Br distance of 228pm) and the Br···Br distance between molecules is 331pm within a layer and 399pm between layers (compare the van der Waals radius of bromine, 195pm).

5|$|Like the United States, the Soviet Union (USSR) {{carried out}} {{research}} on multiple enrichment technologies for the Soviet atomic bomb project. A trial electromagnetic process {{was carried out}} in 1946 with a calutron using a magnet taken from Germany. A site was chosen for an electromagnetic plant at Sverdlovsk-45 in 1946. The pilot plant, known as Plant 418, was completed in 1948. A more efficient design was developed in which the particle beams were bent by 225° instead of 180° as in the American calutron. It was used to complete the uranium enrichment process after technical difficulties were encountered with <b>the</b> <b>gaseous</b> diffusion process. Uranium enriched to about 40 percent uranium-235 was brought to Sverdlovsk-45 for final enrichment to between 92 and 98 percent. After the problems with <b>the</b> <b>gaseous</b> diffusion process were resolved in 1950, it was decided not to proceed with a full-scale electromagnetic plant. , it remains operational. In 1969, a research calutron known as S-2 was built at Arzamas-16 for high-efficiency separation of isotopes of heavy elements like plutonium.|$|E

5|$|Starburst {{galaxies are}} {{characterized}} by dusty concentrations of gas {{and the appearance of}} newly formed stars, including massive stars that ionize the surrounding clouds to create H II regions. These massive stars produce supernova explosions, resulting in expanding remnants that interact powerfully with the surrounding gas. These outbursts trigger a chain reaction of star building that spreads throughout <b>the</b> <b>gaseous</b> region. Only when the available gas is nearly consumed or dispersed does the starburst activity end.|$|E
5|$|The element hydrogen, {{with one}} {{electron}} per neutral atom, is usually {{placed at the}} top of Group 1 of the periodic table for convenience, but hydrogen is not normally considered to be an alkali metal; when it is considered to be an alkali metal, it is because of its atomic properties and not its chemical properties. Under typical conditions, pure hydrogen exists as a diatomic gas consisting of two atoms per molecule (H2); however, the alkali metals only form diatomic molecules (such as dilithium, Li2) at high temperatures, when they are in <b>the</b> <b>gaseous</b> state.|$|E
