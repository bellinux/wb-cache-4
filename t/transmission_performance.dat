50|$|As a fluid {{coupling}} operates kinetically, low viscosity fluids are preferred. Generally speaking, multi-grade motor oils or automatic transmission fluids are used. Increasing {{density of the}} fluid increases the amount of torque that can be transmitted at a given input speed. However, hydraulic fluids, much like other fluids, are subject to changes in viscosity with temperature change. This leads {{to a change in}} <b>transmission</b> <b>performance</b> and so where unwanted performance/efficiency change has to be kept to a minimum, a motor oil or automatic transmission fluid, with a high viscosity index should be used.|$|E
50|$|A {{cylindrical}} rod wrap {{consists of}} a specified number turns of fiber on a mandrel of specified size, depending on the fibre characteristics and the desired modal distribution. It has application in optical <b>transmission</b> <b>performance</b> tests, to create a defined mode power distribution or to prevent multimode propagation in single mode fibre. If the launch fibre is fully filled ahead of the mandrel wrap, the higher-order modes will be stripped off, leaving only lower-order modes. If the launch fibre is underfilled, for example {{as a consequence of}} being energized by a laser diode or edge-emitting LED, there will be no effect on the mode power distribution or loss measurements.|$|E

50|$|Initially, the Justy was {{equipped}} with a 1.0 or 1.2 liter EF three-cylinder engine and either a manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission with either front wheel drive or on-demand four wheel drive. The CVT technology (a pushbelt system) was employed because with a conventional automatic <b>transmission,</b> <b>performance</b> would have been unacceptable, due to the small 3-cylinder engine; due to driving conditions in Japan, where the speed limits in Japan realistically don't exceed 40 km/h in urban areas, the Justy was an affordable choice.

50|$|So the cross-layer {{can be used}} to {{make the}} optimal {{modulation}} to improve the <b>transmission</b> <b>performance,</b> such as data rate, energy efficiency, QoS (Quality of Service), etc. Sensor nodes can be imagined as small computers which are extremely basic in terms of their interfaces and their components. They usually consist of a processing unit with limited computational power and limited memory, sensors or MEMS (including specific conditioning circuitry), a communication device (usually radio transceivers or alternatively optical), and a power source usually in the form of a battery. Other possible inclusions are energy harvesting modules, secondary ASICs, and possibly secondary communication interface (e.g. RS-232 or USB).|$|E
50|$|The {{main concern}} about ITO is the cost. ITO can be priced several times more highly than {{aluminium}} zinc oxide (AZO). AZO {{is a common}} choice of transparent conducting oxide (TCO) because of cost and relatively good optical <b>transmission</b> <b>performance</b> in the solar spectrum. However, ITO does consistently defeat AZO in almost every performance category including chemical resistance to moisture. ITO is not affected by moisture and it can survive in a copper indium gallium selenide solar cell for 25-30 years on a rooftop.While the sputtering target or evaporative material {{that is used to}} deposit the ITO is significantly more costly than AZO, the amount of material placed on each cell is quite small. Therefore, the cost penalty per cell is quite small too.|$|E

50|$|Automatic digital {{modulation}} recognition in intelligent communication systems {{is one of}} the most important issues in software defined radio and cognitive radio. According to incremental expanse of intelligent receivers, automatic modulation recognition becomes a challenging topic in telecommunication systems and computer engineering. Such systems have many civil and military applications. Moreover, blind recognition of modulation type is an important problem in commercial systems, especially in software defined radio. Usually in such systems, there are some extra information for system configuration, but considering blind approaches in intelligent receivers, we can reduce information overload and increase <b>transmission</b> <b>performance.</b> Obviously, with no knowledge of the transmitted data and many unknown parameters at the receiver, such as the signal power, carrier frequency and phase offsets, timing information, etc., blind identification of the modulation is made fairly difficult. This becomes even more challenging in real-world scenarios with multipath fading, frequency-selective and time-varying channels.|$|E

In contrast to conventional concrete core activation, the capillary tubes used in thermal building component activation lie about 5 mm close under the ceiling surface. This arrangement ensures a fast reaction and a high <b>transmission</b> <b>performance</b> of up to 90 W/m² (at 10 K temperature difference, see above), and also uses the concrete mass as a thermal accumulator.
