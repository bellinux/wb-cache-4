5|$|The {{chlorine}} oxides are well-studied {{in spite of}} their instability (all of them are endothermic compounds). They are important because they are produced when chlorofluorocarbons undergo photolysis in the upper atmosphere and cause the destruction of the ozone layer.

5|$|Certain {{physical}} and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat <b>them</b> <b>can</b> increase risk of obesity. Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) {{as well as some}} congenital or acquired conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, and the eating disorders: binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome. However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness. The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the large}} number of Latter Day Saint churches and their differing backgrounds, categorizing <b>them</b> <b>can</b> be difficult. A common {{approach}} in some histories and studies is to use Rocky Mountain Saints for those denominations headquartered in the American West and Prairie Saints for those denominations that formed in and around Nauvoo, Illinois; Voree, Wisconsin; Independence, Missouri; and other locations in the Midwest and East. These terms do not necessarily relate the current geographical locations of all denominations within those two groupings, but rather the original location of their respective parent organizations, which may be seen in the table below.|$|E

5|$|Gout {{is partly}} genetic, {{contributing}} to about 60% of variability in uric acid level. The SLC2A9, SLC22A12 and ABCG2 genes {{have been found}} to be commonly associated with gout and variations in <b>them</b> <b>can</b> approximately double the risk. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A9 and SLC22A12 cause hereditary hypouricaemia by reducing urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion. The rare genetic disorders familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, medullary cystic kidney disease, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency as seen in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, are complicated by gout.|$|E
5|$|Like mayflies, {{stoneflies}} and dragonflies, but to {{a somewhat}} lesser extent, caddisflies are an indicator of good water quality; they die out of streams with polluted waters. They {{are an important part}} of the food web, both larvae and adults being eaten by many fish. The newly hatched adult is particularly vulnerable as it struggles to the surface after emerging from the submerged pupa, and as it dries its wings. The fish find these new adults easy pickings, and fishing flies resembling <b>them</b> <b>can</b> be successful for anglers at the right time of year.|$|E

5|$|Serpins are {{involved}} in a wide array of physiological functions, and so mutations in genes encoding <b>them</b> <b>can</b> cause a range of diseases. Mutations that change the activity, specificity or aggregation properties of serpins all affect how they function. The majority of serpin-related diseases are the result of serpin polymerisation into aggregates, though several other types of disease-linked mutations also occur. The disorder α-Antitrypsin deficiency {{is one of the most}} common hereditary diseases.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen {{isotopes}} of americium {{are known}} with mass numbers from 232 to 248. The most important are 241Am and 243Am, which are alpha-emitters and also emit soft, but intense γ-rays; both of <b>them</b> <b>can</b> be obtained in an isotopically pure form. Chemical properties of americium were first studied with 241Am, but later shifted to 243Am, {{which is almost}} 20 times less radioactive. The disadvantage of 243Am is production of the short-lived daughter isotope 239Np, which has {{to be considered in}} the data analysis.|$|E
5|$|The player's primary mode of {{transportation}} is a starship which serves as Shepard's base of operations. Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, buy new equipment, and travel to numerous planetary systems. Although the game features {{a large number of}} planets for the player to examine, only a few of <b>them</b> <b>can</b> actually be landed on and explored. Some of <b>them</b> <b>can</b> also be surveyed to search for valuable resources and quest-relevant items. Upon landing on a planet, the player can traverse on-foot or by using an all-terrain infantry fighting vehicle called the M35 Mako. Most of the game's main quests are geared toward on-foot combat, but some segments may feature combat requiring the use of the M35 Mako. In contrast, secondary quests usually require the player to explore free-roam uncharted worlds with the vehicle. Equipment items, which include armor, weapon, and ammunition upgrades, can be found around the environment or purchased from merchants in settlements.|$|E

5|$|Actinides {{are typical}} metals. All {{of them are}} soft and have a silvery color (but tarnish in air), {{relatively}} high density and plasticity. Some of <b>them</b> <b>can</b> be cut with a knife. Their electrical resistivity varies between 15 and 150 µOhm·cm. The hardness of thorium {{is similar to that}} of soft steel, so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire. Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium, but is harder than either of them. All actinides are radioactive, paramagnetic, and, with the exception of actinium, have several crystalline phases: plutonium has seven, and uranium, neptunium and californium three. The crystal structures of protactinium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3d-transition metals.|$|E

5|$|Barring Link's {{progress}} are creatures he must {{battle to}} locate the entrances to nine underground dungeons. Each dungeon is a unique, maze-like collection of rooms connected by doors and secret passages, and guarded by monsters different from those found on the surface. Dungeons also contain useful items which Link can add to his arsenal, such as a boomerang for retrieving distant items and stunning enemies, and a recorder with magical properties. Link must successfully navigate through {{each of the first}} eight dungeons to obtain all eight pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom. Once he has completed the artifact, he can enter the ninth dungeon to rescue Zelda. Apart from this exception, the order of completing dungeons is somewhat left to the player, although they steadily increase in difficulty and some of <b>them</b> <b>can</b> only be reached or completed using items gained in a previous one. In addition, the entrances of the three highest-level dungeons are hidden. Link can freely wander the overworld, finding and buying items at any point. This flexibility enables unusual ways of playing the game. For example, it is possible to reach the final boss of the game without ever receiving the first sword.|$|E
5|$|Finn and Jake then {{attempt to}} find new homes. Initially {{they are unable to}} find a {{suitable}} home until they stumble upon a cave. They clean up the cave and hold a house-warming party, which Marceline crashes. She explains that the cave also belongs to her. Finn, having had enough starts a fight with Marceline, who grows into a huge demonic bat. After she seemingly kills Jake, Finn goes into a rage and violently punches Marceline, who promptly shape-shifts into her regular form and then kisses Finn on the cheek, making him blush. Jake—who was able to use his shape-shifting powers to save himself—runs over to Finn, and Marceline states that the fight they had was fun and that the two of <b>them</b> <b>can</b> have their old house back, as a gift. Once Finn and Jake return to their old abode, they are promptly hypnotized by King Worm (voiced by Erik Estrada).|$|E
5|$|For grieving {{parents who}} form {{emotional}} bonds with reborn dolls, some child bereavement counselors advise against parents substituting their deceased child with the dolls. Reborn mothers contend {{that they are}} not replacing children but remembering them. Psychiatrist Sue Varma, teacher at the NYU school of medicine, says mothering reborn dolls rather than just collecting <b>them</b> <b>can</b> become a problem when it is used as prop and becomes the person's only form of socializing. Psychiatrist Gail Saltz with New York Presbyterian Hospital supports the use of reborns for people who do not want to make the commitment of having a real child, and also to comfort bereaved parents. She offers that in this case the reborn may symbolize a step in the grieving process. Concern should only come if someone who lost a baby grows too attached to their reborn because it could indicate their grief is not getting resolved. In this case, the likeness of the doll to the deceased child risks being harmful as a permanent replacement for the grieving parents. Ian James, a doctor at the Centre for the Health of the Elderly at Newcastle General Hospital in the U.K., said that holding the dolls helps calm elderly residents, helping them feel peaceful and quiet.|$|E

5|$|In {{autoimmunity}} {{the immune}} system wrongly recognizes certain native molecules in the body as foreign (self-antigen), and mounts an immune response against them. Since these native molecules, as normal parts of the body, will naturally always exist in the body, the attacks against <b>them</b> <b>can</b> get stronger over time (akin to secondary immune response). Moreover, many organisms exhibit molecular mimicry, which involves showing those antigens on their surface that are antigenically similar to the host proteins. This has two possible consequences: first, either the organism will be spared as a self antigen; or secondly, that the antibodies produced against it will also bind to the mimicked native proteins. The antibodies will attack the self-antigens and the tissues harboring them by activating various mechanisms like the complement activation and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Hence, wider the range of antibody-specificities, greater the chance that {{one or the other}} will react against self-antigens (native molecules of the body).|$|E
5|$|In the game's single-player mode, {{the player}} must {{complete}} {{a series of}} levels where different types of AI-controlled enemies will try to hinder the player's progress. The game primarily takes place inside labyrinthine underground facilities, but the player can occasionally travel {{over the surface of}} the planets where the facilities are buried to reach other nearby areas. The underground facilities are composed of a set of tunnels and rooms separated by doors. Most of <b>them</b> <b>can</b> be opened by either firing weapons at them or bumping into them, but others require special actions to be performed first before entry is allowed. For instance, some doors require special keys to open them. To finish a level and proceed to the next one, the player must complete a certain set of objectives, ranging from collecting items to activating switches, defeating enemies, and destroying objects, among others. Some levels also feature optional objectives that are not critical but add to the player's overall completion score.|$|E
