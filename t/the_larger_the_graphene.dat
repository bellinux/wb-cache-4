30|$|The {{resulting}} lithium {{storage for}} r = 2.8 Å roughly corresponds to that predicted for C 54 H 18 in Suzuki et al. [8]. We comment that <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> <b>graphene</b> sheets, the more lithium ions {{can be stored}} and which becomes beyond the computational capacity of the method of Suzuki et al. [8]. This study might offer a far more realistic engineering estimation procedure for battery design using graphene nanosheets as anodes. The merit of the continuous approximation is that we may predict the lithium storage capacity for graphene sheets of any size, which could be computationally challenging using molecular orbital calculations. We also comment from Figure 7 {{that the increase in}} layer numbers involves higher lithium ion storage. For the double and triple ion layers, the calculated storage capacities are both higher than the maximum theoretical storage capacity for conventional graphitic carbon materials, i.e., 372 mAh/g [1], which is approximately equivalent to the case of a single ion layer, i.e., D = 5 Å [8]. Although the triple layers store more lithium ions than the double layers, the more sophisticated calculations performed by Suzuki et al. [8] show that the double ion layers configuration is the most preferable candidate for higher lithium storage. Their calculations take into account the charge-discharge property to prevent the formation of hysteresis resulting from a decrease in positive charges of lithium ions with an increase in ion layers.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  2 a, all grown {{structures}} show non-continuous film structures with grain-like morphologies surrounded with wide cracking structures. Recently, {{we have also}} observed the same tendency {{for the growth of}} SiC on single-layer graphene (SLG) where grain-like film structure was obtained [30]. However, {{in the case of the}} growth of SiC on <b>graphene,</b> <b>the</b> grain-like film structures are continuous without any cracking structure. As reported in ref. [30], the resulted grain structures are presumably due to the nature of grain-like structure of polycrystalline <b>graphene</b> used. <b>The</b> possible reason why the cracking is generated in this growth is speculated due to the stacking structures or uneven thicknesses of MLG [34]. From the cross-sectional FESEM images shown in Fig.  2 b, it can be clearly seen that the sizes and the thicknesses of deposited grain structures increase with the current densities. As can be seen in Fig.  2 b, the thicknesses of deposited grain layer increase from 4.3 μm at current density of 0.5 mA/cm 2 to 6.1 μm at current density of 3.5 mA/cm 2. Also, the width of cracking structures also seems to increase with the current densities. In principle, we believe that the morphology of the grown structures is determined by the nature of grain-like structure of polycrystalline MLG. When the current densities are increased, the deposition rates of the grown layers increase resulting to the increase in the thicknesses. Such high deposition rates seem to be able to combine the small grain-like structures by covering the grain boundaries especially at the grain area with same graphene thicknesses or even with small difference of thicknesses. Thus, such mechanism leads to <b>the</b> formation of <b>larger</b> grain-like structures. <b>The</b> cracking structures are still being observed and not able to be eliminated presumably due to <b>the</b> <b>large</b> difference in <b>the</b> <b>graphene</b> thicknesses. <b>The</b> cracking structure becomes apparent due to thick deposited layer. Meanwhile, the EDX spectra (data not shown) confirmed that the grown films contain Ga, O, and N elements indicating the possible formation of GaON and Ga 2 O 3 structures.|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the behavior of}} submonolayer quantum films (He and H 2) on graphene and newly discovered surfaces that are derived from graphene. Among these substrates are graphane (abbreviated GH), which has an H atom bonded to each C atom, and fluorographene (GF). For the graphite case, extensive experimental and theoretical investigations have revealed that the phase diagrams of the bose gases 4 He and para-H 2 are qualitatively similar, differing primarily in a higher characteristic temperature scale for H 2 than for He. The phase behaviors of these films {{on one side of}} pristine graphene, or both sides of free-standing graphene, are expected to be similar to those on graphite. We point out the possibility of novel phenomena in adsorption on <b>graphene</b> related to <b>the</b> <b>large</b> flexibility of <b>the</b> <b>graphene</b> sheet, to <b>the</b> non [...] negligible interaction between atoms adsorbed {{on opposite sides of the}} sheet and to the perturbation effect of the adsorbed layer on the Dirac electrons. In contrast, the behaviors predicted on GF and GH surfaces are very different from those on graphite, a result of the different corrugation, i. e., the lateral variation of the potential experienced by these gases. As a result of this novel geometry and potential, distinct properties are observed. For example, the 4 He film's ground-state on graphite is a two-dimensional (2 D) crystal commensurate with the substrate; on GF and GH, instead, it is predicted to be an anisotropic superfluid. On GF the anisotropy is so extreme that the roton excitations are very anisotropic, as if the bosons are moving in a multiconnected space along the bonds of a honeycomb lattice. Such a novel phase has not been predicted or observed previously on any substrate. Also, in the case of 3 He the film's ground-state is a fluid, thus offering the possibility of studying an anisotropic Fermi fluid with a tunable density.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to prepare graphenes, to reactively modify their surface to enhance exfoliation and to facilitate bonding to chosen matrix polymers, to characterise the prepared materials and determine their physical and mechanical properties. This investigation was motivated by the exceptional performance characteristics of graphene to find new ways of creating and dispersing graphene in polymers, so polymer-graphene composites were fabricated. Composites enhanced by <b>the</b> properties of <b>graphene</b> were prepared inspired by the unique nanostructure of graphene that imparts high strength, stiffness and resistance to deformation. Graphenes were prepared using thermal expansion in an oxidising atmosphere (air), an inert atmosphere (nitrogen N 2) and a reducing atmosphere (hydrogen H 2 or carbon monoxide CO). <b>The</b> reduction of <b>graphene</b> using thermal expansion with simultaneous CO reduction was granted a provisional patent (Appendix A). <b>The</b> <b>graphenes</b> were characterised using thermogravimetry (TGA), Raman spectroscopy, electrical resistance and surface energy measurements. All graphenes showed a mass loss in TGA which was attributed to oxygen‑containing functional groups present on <b>the</b> <b>graphene</b> surface. <b>The</b> mass loss was lowest for the inert and reducing atmospheres. Raman spectroscopy (using the D/G peak ratio) showed that <b>graphene</b> had <b>the</b> fewest defects in the order CO&lt;H 2 &lt;N 2 &lt;air and produced the fewest layers (as measured using the highest 2 D/G ratio) under a CO reducing atmosphere. The electrical resistance (as measured using a compressed pellet) was lowest for graphene prepared under a reducing or inert atmosphere and highest under air. The contact angle was measured and used to calculate the surface energy which was found to be lower when produced under a reducing or inert atmosphere and highest when produced under air (CO&lt;N 2 &lt;H 2 &lt;air). This increased hydrophobicity was consistent with a reduction in surface oxides, healing of surface defects and scrolling of graphenes, which was supported by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). <b>The</b> <b>graphene</b> produced had a surface area greater than commercially produced graphene. All of this suggests that <b>the</b> CO reduced <b>graphene</b> is superior to other <b>graphene</b> production methods. <b>The</b> <b>graphenes</b> were then used to produce four different polymer composites including a thermoplastic elastomer (poly(styrene-b-butadiene-b-styrene); SBS at two compositions), a semi-crystalline thermoplastic (polyethylene terephthalate; PET at two compositions) and two high-performance amorphous polymers (polycarbonate (PC) and poly(ether sulfone) (PES)). The composites were prepared by dispersion of <b>the</b> <b>graphene</b> into polymer solutions using ultrasonication and high torque melt dispersion. The SBS-graphene (1 %∙w/w) composites were produced using graphenes prepared in air, N 2 and H 2 and using solvent dispersion (SD). The greatest changes occurred using the H 2 reduced graphene which showed increased stored energy (storage modulus), energy absorption (loss modulus) and damping (tan delta) in SBS. The damping effect (move to a more liquid state and greater free volume) was largest at low temperatures as a result of <b>the</b> <b>large</b> size of <b>the</b> <b>graphene</b> sheets used. Functionalising <b>the</b> <b>graphene</b> with Fe 3 O 4 before combining it with SBS resulted in a composite that displayed magnetic properties. The SBS-graphene (0 - 20 %∙w/w) composites were produced using GT-CO reduced graphenes and using solvent dispersion. Stress-strain measurements showed a progressive decrease in deformation and increase in damping as <b>the</b> <b>graphene</b> content increased suggesting uniform dispersion in the SBS. The presence of aromatic interactions and hydrogen bonding between <b>the</b> SBS and <b>graphene</b> was supported by density functional theory calculations. Some scrolling of graphene was observed in this SBS composite. The PET-graphene (1 %∙w/w) composites produced using the GT-H 2 reduced graphene were prepared using solvent dispersion (with ultrasonication) and melt dispersion (without ultrasonication). Nucleation of PET did not occur using <b>the</b> low defect <b>graphene</b> although oxygen permeation of the composite increased which was attributed to an increased free volume. The results suggested that using a combination of ultrasonication and melt dispersion of <b>graphene</b> to produce <b>the</b> composite would increase the exfoliation and dispersion further. The PET-graphene (1 %∙w/w) composites using GT-CO reduced graphenes were prepared using melt dispersion (MD) alone or combined with ultrasonication. When using ultrasonication graphene agglomeration in PET was diminished, and reduction of <b>the</b> <b>graphene</b> could be seen by a darkening of the colour of the composite. PET deformation (ductility) increased with ultrasonication and melt dispersion of <b>graphene.</b> <b>The</b> PC-graphene (0. 1 %∙w/w) composites using GT-H 2 or GT-CO reduced graphene with low filler content were prepared using melt dispersion with ultrasonication. The storage modulus of PC-graphene composites was greater than PC alone indicating stronger interfacial interactions existed with <b>graphene.</b> <b>The</b> time-dependent loss of energy (loss modulus) and damping (greater liquid properties) increased when graphene was added to PC. The increase in damping suggested an increase in free volume. DFT calculations indicated that <b>the</b> interactions between <b>graphene</b> and PC were due to a combination of &pi;-&pi; and CH/&pi; bonding. Despite being relatively weak, the interaction of the aromatic rings and the H atoms on the methyl groups, in the monomer, both {{play a significant role in}} <b>the</b> attraction with <b>graphene.</b> <b>The</b> PES-graphene (1 %∙w/w) composites using GT-H 2 or GT-CO reduced graphenes were prepared using solvent dispersion with ultrasonication. GT-CO reduced graphene showed evidence of rolling or scrolling in PES which increases cross-sectional area. Interactions between PES GT-CO increased indicating a move to a more solid state and an increase in elasticity. The results demonstrated that PES binds well with graphene using only non-covalent bonding. In each case, the polymer-graphene composites demonstrated good dispersion which establishes that &pi;-interactions and hydrogen bonding are an effective way to disperse graphene. Where similar or comparable data was found for covalent bonding, it demonstrated that non-covalent bonding gave similar results. By using only non-covalent bonding, the pristine nature of <b>the</b> <b>graphene</b> was maintained creating low defect polymer-graphene composites. Low defect graphenes have advantages such as improved electrical and thermal conductivity, fewer contaminants, greater biocompatibility and the benefit of a less dangerous processing method. The optimal processing method combined ultrasonication and melt dispersion which are synergistic reducing (signalled by darker colour) and exfoliating <b>graphene</b> further. <b>The</b> scrolling of low defect GT-CO reduced graphene is of particular interest because the increased cross-sectional area gives it the potential to improve thermal and electrical conductivity...|$|R
