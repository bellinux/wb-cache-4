40|$|Continuous-fibre-reinforced <b>thermoset</b> <b>laminates</b> {{that are}} cured hot, exhibit {{deformations}} due to cure and thermal shrinkage. When L-shaped composite components are {{released from the}} mould after cooling to ambient temperature, a decrease of the enclosed angle is observed. This {{is referred to as}} the springforward phenomenon. The main cause of springforward, the mismatch in thermal expansion along and across the fibres, cannot explain totally the springforward found in experiments. Three other possible influences on springforward were investigated: an inhomogeneous fibre/matrix distribution through the thickness, an inhomogeneous heat distribution during the cure cycle and the difference in thermal expansion between the mould and the composite component. Finite element results show that the springforward is affected significantly by the amount of cure shrinkage and by the difference in thermal expansion between the mould and the composite component...|$|R
40|$|During {{manufacturing}} {{of thick}} (> 20 mm) laminates, thermal gradients through the thickness may arise due to, for example, exothermal reactive heat release. These thermal variations {{may result in}} residual strain gradients through the thickness as well as variations in polymer matrix properties, such as degree of cure. For prediction and simulation of the residual strains, {{it is essential that}} the manufacturing process is monitored, in order to identify the parameters responsible for the residual strain build-up. The research described in this paper, proposes the use of Fibre Bragg Grating sensors as an experimental tool to determine variations in (thermal) residual strain levels through the thickness in a thick glass fibre reinforced <b>thermoset</b> <b>laminate.</b> In addition, other manufacturing issues, such as the flow behaviour that could be identified with these sensors were addressed.

COM-FIRE, a finite difference implementation of the Henderson Equation, was able to model the thermal and residual resin profiles in the laminate during fire exposure. The thermal predictions were used, in conjunction with the measured mechanical property data, to model changes in elastic properties and stress rupture behaviour in fire. Because of the non-linearity of the tensile stress-strain curves, a 3 -parameter model was needed to describe behaviour.

40|$|Abstract. As {{the usage}} of {{composites}} materials are significant in the industries of automobiles, shipping and constructions due to their non-corrosive and high strength to weight ratio. Anyway, the production of composites needed to be increased to meet the demand.

40|$|Currently the joining of cured {{thermoset}} {{composite materials}} for aerospace applications {{occurs in a}} suboptimal manner. The structure is joined by mechanical fastening, optionally in conjunction with an adhesive. The joining is sub-optimal because the fasteners require holes in the thin fibrous structure. These holes are stress concentrations, therefore the number of plies and thus {{the weight of the}} structure is increased to accommodate them. Adhesive joints do not require holes but these joints still have challenges in the field of non-destructive testing (NDT), which precludes their use for the joining of structural parts in aerospace. Consolidated thermoplastic materials have an additional joining technique that can be used, namely fusion bonding. This technique uses the property that distinguishes thermoplastics from thermosets, they have the ability to melt or soften under increased temperature. In this molten or softened state themolecular chains of the thermoplastic resin possesses increased mobility. If the thermoplastic is in intimate contact with another miscible thermoplastic while it is in this heated state the molecular chains can diffuse into each other and intermingle, creating a bond. This bond does not possess the stress concentrations associated with mechanical fastening, or the phenomenon of kissing bonds which inhibits certification in adhesive bonds. In industry fusion bonding is solely applied to unreinforced thermoplastic materials, fusion bonding of thermoplastic composites is only applied in research. To enable fusion bonding of cured thermoset composites a thermoplastic interlayer can be co-cured, which is a thin thermoplastic film that provides a fusible surface to the thermoset structure, it can thus be used to fuse the thermoset structure to another fusible part. The interlayer can be surface treated before cure so that they can form an interfacial adhesive bond with the <b>thermoset</b> <b>laminate.</b> This approach makes the joint susceptible to the same challenges faced by adhesive bonding. Therefore this research investigates the use of a material combination that is initially miscible, so that they can form an interphase during cure instead of an adhesive interface, the interphase is a gradual transition from onematerial to the next. The fusion bonding process itself also poses some challenges. Fusion bonding of aerospace grade thermoplastics typically require temperatures far above the maximum temperature allowed by the co-cured <b>thermoset</b> <b>laminate.</b> A solution to this problem is the use of a fast and concentrated method of heat generation that can keep the elevated temperature experienced by the thermoset material limited and short in time, preventing thermal degradation. Ultrasonic welding is a fusion bonding technique that is capable of creating fusion bonds with heating times in the order of 500 ms, proven to be short enough to prevent thermal degradation for the materials used in this research. Another important issue foreseen and addressed in this research is the question if the interphase between the interlayer and the thermoset material can withstand the aggresive welding process. Previous experience with surface treated interlayers showed that some interlayer/ surface treatment/thermoset material combinations can detach at the interlayer/thermoset interface after welding. This research shows that the interphase is affected in some locations, but the fusion bond is nonetheless maintained through the entire weld overlap. The apparent lap shear strength of the joints created with an interphase forming interlayer is comparable to the joints created with adhesive interface forming interlayer. Both joint types retain their strength when exposed to prolonged exposure to moisture, simulating a worstcase scenario in amanufacturing setting. Exposure to a cleaning solvent significantly affected the interphase forming joint type, attributed to the amorphous structure of the thermoplastic used. This research shows that when selecting the right material as interlayer for creating a fusion bonding capable <b>thermoset</b> <b>laminate,</b> a joint can be created that could avoid the certification challenge experienced by adhesive bonding, while simultaneously using aerospace grade materials without thermally degrading the joint during fusion.

40|$|NonWOSInternational audienceThis paper draws {{attention}} to the quality problems encountered during the curing of thick structural thermosetting composites for naval use. For example, during curing thermal gradients and internal stresses are generated, leading to several imperfections (bubbles, fibre waviness, etc) and, therefore, decreasing the quality of the composite. The first part of the paper presents experimental results about material quality description. In particular, gradients of properties (degree of cure, cure shrinkage, elastic modulus) are clearly established within the composite and their dependency to the cure is presented. In the second part, a numerical tool that couples mechanical, physical and chemical phenomena, and devoted to industrial software, is proposed for cure simulation. The first finite element modelling (FEM) results are presented and compared with experimental data of the cure. Thermal load is an important factor for thick <b>thermosetting</b> <b>laminates</b> quality, since the coupling effect between the thermo-activated and exothermal behaviour for thermosets becomes more pronounced with mass effect.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} beneficial effect of the variable frequency microwave (VFM) technology to cure <b>thermosetting</b> prepreg <b>laminates.</b> Further, it was to investigate the interrelationship and effect on the curing process of frequency, band width, and curing time with different types of laminates. Previous studies of microwave-assisted curing of neat resins (epoxy) and unidirectional glass and carbon fiber laminates with a fixed frequency of 2. 45 GHz, have shown that a substantial reduction in the curing time was obtained. Results of this earlier work indicate that the microwave-assisted curing of multidirectional glass fiber laminates also show a substantial reduction of the required curing time. This may be explained by the penetration of microwave energy directly and throughout the laminate with enhancement of the kinetics of the chemical reaction. The fixed frequency microwave radiation of 2. 45 GHz has been demonstrated to be a partially acceptable method to cure unidirectional carbon fiber laminates. Multidirectional carbon fiber/epoxy laminates demonstrate a lack of coupling during the curing process. A direct curing of these laminates was not possible by microwave radiation with the experimental approach used in agreement with previous work. In addition to this short coming, the unidirectional laminate samples cured with the fixed frequency are visually nonuniform. Localized areas of darker colors (burn, hot spots, overheating) are attributed to the formation of standing waves within the microwave cavity. For this reason, the laminates are subject to proper rotation while curing through fixed frequency. The present research indicates that variable frequency microwave technology is a sound and acceptable processing method to effectively cure uni-, bi- or multi-directional <b>thermosetting</b> glass fiber <b>laminates.</b> Also, this methodology will effectively cure unidirectional <b>thermosetting</b> carbon fiber <b>laminates.</b> For all these cases, this technology yielded a substantial reduction in the required cure time of these laminates.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The curing {{of an open}} mold {{composite}} {{consisting of}} three <b>laminated</b> <b>thermoset</b> layers is simulated using a one-dimensional finite element model (FEM). This curing simulation addresses the reaction kinetics {{of each of the}} thermoset polyester resins as well as the thermal transport across the composite to calculate a time-dependent cure of each layer. Curing of each of the resins is modeled as an autocatalytic reaction based on the isothermal reaction exotherms at several temperatures. These reaction models depend sensitively on processing parameters. In particular, the models are specific to each polyester formulation, pre-promoter, and concentration of methyl ethyl ketone peroxide initiator. A nonlinear, transient, one-dimensional FEM coupling the reaction exotherm with the thermal properties of the composite is being implemented in Abaqus. The measured temperature profiles of the composite layers during cure are semi-quantitatively reproduced by the model providing the degree of cure for each composite layer. Using the calculated degree of cure, the time evolution of the modulus of each layer can be estimated.
