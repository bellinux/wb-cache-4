5|$|With {{the fuel}} price {{increases}} of the 2000s, <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>and</b> many companies {{have sought to}} increase diesel truck fuel economy. One such example is the hydraulic hybrid vehicle, which stores energy in hydraulic tanks and hydraulic motors (as opposed to the electric hybrid vehicle which uses batteries and regenerative brakes). Electric hybrid vehicles are another option, with savings of 35 to 60 percent over traditional vehicles. Drivers themselves may improve fuel efficiency by using a method called progressive shifting, in which the driver shifts through the gears (typical trucks may have between 10 and 18 gears) {{in such a manner}} as to optimize the power range of the engine.|$|E
5|$|Baby {{flying foxes}} usually come into care {{after having been}} {{separated}} from their mothers. Babies are often orphaned during {{four to six weeks}} of age, when they inadvertently fall off their mothers during flight. When they are older, orphans usually come into care because of maternal death from power line electrocution or barbed wire entanglement. A rare, but apparent natural, occurrence of mass abandonment can lead to the rescue of hundreds of babies at one time. The latter most recently occurred in November 2008 at the Canungra bat camp in South East Queensland, when Wildcare Australia, working closely with <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>and</b> regional bat care groups, rescued and rehabilitated over 300 baby grey-headed flying foxes. Most babies are in a dehydrated and distressed state by the time they are rescued, and some are infested with maggots if found sick or injured. A young flying fox must be fed every four hours, and then as it develops it is introduced to blossoms and fruit. When the young flying fox is fully weaned around 10 to 12 weeks of age, it goes into a crèche for rehabilitation and eventual release.|$|E

The cost of cleaning up the Raymark Site is estimated to have exceeded $200 million.|$|E
25|$|The FQPA {{requires}} that pesticide registration be reviewed periodically, {{with a goal}} of once every 15 years. The FQPA mandated changes {{in the collection of}} tolerance fee’s, increasing the amount of fee money from $14 million to $16 million to help with the reassessment of tolerances. The FQPA requires the EPA to specifically screen pesticides for disruption to the endocrine system. The FQPA requires the EPA to establish an integrated pest management education program and implement integrated pest management research and demonstration. The FQPA encourages the syncing of U.S. pesticide tolerances with those of international standards. Under the FQPA individual states are not allowed to set different pesticide tolerances than <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>and</b> the EPA is required to coordinate data requirements between the state and federal levels. The EPA is required to develop and distribute a food safety brochure and create an annual report on the progress of its registration program.|$|E
25|$|On May 9, 2000, a fire {{destroyed}} a seven-story aging warehouse {{at the company}} in Anderson County, Kentucky. It contained more than 17,000 wooden barrels of whiskey. Burning whiskey flowed from the warehouse, setting the woods on fire, causing limestone deposits to explode. Firefighters saved Lawrenceburg's water treatment plant from destruction. However, an estimated 20% of the whiskey flowed into the Kentucky River. The river contamination required the temporary shutdown of the water treatment plant. Officials ordered water usage restrictions. Businesses and schools were closed because of the water shortage. The alcohol spill also depleted the oxygen in the river, killing an estimated 228,000 fish along a 66-mile stretch. <b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>and</b> the Coast Guard's Gulf Strike Team aerated the river using equipment mounted on barges.

40|$|This {{project will}} focus on the Economic Partnership Agreement (<b>EPA)</b> between <b>the</b> European union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of states (ACP), and the {{difficulties}} surrounding the EPA-negotiations.

This report will then analyse the theoretical foundation of <b>the</b> <b>EPAs,</b> {{in order to determine the}} theoretical approach to the goals and means of the agreement. Furthermore, we will analyse the criticism of <b>the</b> <b>EPAs</b> raised by a number of internal sources, in the form of a number of ministers from the Sub-Saharan ACP countries, and external sources, in the form of International NGO’s, in order to determine the reasons behind this criticism. This will lead to a brief assessment of the coherence between the criticisms, made respectively by the internal and external sources connected to the EPA-negotiations. This study will conclude that the differences between <b>the</b> <b>EPAs</b> <b>and</b> its supporters on one side, and the critics of <b>the</b> <b>EPAs</b> on <b>the</b> other, can be explained by fundamentally different theoretical views on how to best secure the development of the ACP-countries. Furthermore, a lack of resources and assistance of the ACP-countries has hindered the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>EPAs.</b> This leads to the conclusion, that it is not a reluctance to engage in a trade agreement between the EU and ACP that has made the implementations of <b>the</b> <b>EPA’s</b> so difficult, but instead it is the different theoretical views on how to best secure the development of the ACP-countries, as well as the technical difficulties surrounding corporation between two unequal partners, that has hampered the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>EPAs...</b>|$|R
