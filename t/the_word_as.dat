5|$|Unlike {{other great}} {{scholars}} {{of the age}} he travelled little and his knowledge of geography came from his library of over one thousand books and maps, from his visitors and from his vast correspondence (in six languages) with other scholars, statesmen, travellers, merchants and seamen. Mercator's early maps were in large formats suitable for wall mounting but {{in the second half}} of his life he produced over 100 new regional maps in a smaller format suitable for binding into his Atlas of 1595. This was the first appearance of the word Atlas in a geographical context but Mercator used it as a neologism for a treatise (Cosmologia) on the creation, history and description of the universe, not simply a collection of maps. He chose <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>as</b> a commemoration of a King Atlas of Mauretania whom he considered to be the first great geographer. This King Atlas was a son of the Titan Atlas but the two myths very quickly coalesced.|$|E

25|$|Ilium is thematically {{influenced}} by extropianism, peopled {{as it is}} with post-humans of the far future. It therefore continues to explore the theme pioneered by H. G. Wells in The Time Machine, a work which is also referenced several times in Simmons' work. One of the most notable references is when the old woman Savi calls the current people of Earth eloi, using <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>as</b> an expression of her disgust of their self-indulgent society, lack of culture and ignorance of their past.|$|E

25|$|A {{system of}} heavy cast leaded bronze coinage was introduced; {{these issues are}} known as aes grave (heavy bronze) by numismatists. Stylistically the coins were {{distinctly}} Roman and, due to both their size and their being cast rather than struck, crude compared to the coinage elsewhere around the Mediterranean at the time. The standard coin was the as; <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>as</b> referred to a coin and also to a unit of weight – in fact, as could also mean any unit – of length, area, and sometimes just the number one.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{diacritics}} occur {{adjacent to}} the letter they modify. In the Wali language of Ghana, for example, an apostrophe indicates a change of vowel quality, but occurs {{at the beginning of}} <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> <b>as</b> in the dialects ’Bulengee and ’Dolimi. Because of vowel harmony, all vowels in a word are affected, so the scope of the diacritic is the entire word. In abugida scripts, like those used to write Hindi and Thai, diacritics indicate vowels, and may occur above, below, before, after, or around the consonant letter they modify.|$|E
25|$|Robinson {{is given}} credit for having popularized the word and claimed to have invented it while still living in Richmond. The Oxford English Dictionary lists the origins of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>as</b> unknown and {{documents}} the earliest written {{use of the word}} in 1919, by the newspaperman and author Irving Bacheller, in his serialized book, A Man for the Ages; this was followed by uses in 1926 by Carl Van Vechten in his novel Nigger Heaven, in 1934 in Webster's New International Dictionary, and by John O'Hara in his novel Appointment in Samarra. Robinson's biographer credits him with having introduced the word into popular culture via his frequent use in vaudeville, radio, and recordings.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} railway in Britain was a wagonway system, a {{horse drawn}} wooden rail system, used by German miners at Caldbeck, Cumbria, England, perhaps from the 1560s.. A wagonway was built at Prescot, near Liverpool, sometime around 1600, possibly {{as early as}} 1594. Owned by Philip Layton, the line carried coal from a pit near Prescot Hall to a terminus {{about half a mile}} away. On 26 July 1803, Jessop opened the Surrey Iron Railway, south of London erroneously considered first railway in Britain, also a horse-drawn one. It was not a railway in the modern sense of <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> <b>as</b> it functioned like a turnpike road. There were no official services, as anyone could bring a vehicle on the railway by paying a toll.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{principal}} reasons for concern about Ashton's {{translation of the}} title. Firstly, 'Judaism' in English carries the meaning of 'the profession or practice of the Jewish religion; the religious system or the polity of the Jews', a topic on which Wagner does not touch. 'Judentum' however in 19th-century Germany carried a much broader meaning—roughly analogous to the nonce English word 'Jewdom' (cf. Christendom) and including {{the concept of the}} social practices of the Jews. In particular it carried the pejorative sense of 'haggling' or 'marketeering'—it was used in this sense for example by Karl Marx. Undoubtedly Wagner wished to refer to this sense, in effect using <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>as</b> a pun, as the commercialism implied forms the topic of the essay as a whole. It is therefore important to bear in mind the full range of implications of the title-word 'Judentum' in considering the essay as a whole. 'Jewishness', whilst not ideal, is perhaps a closer English approximation to 'Judentum' than 'Judaism'.|$|E
25|$|St. Gregory VII having, indeed, {{abridged}} {{the order}} of prayers, and having simplified the Liturgy as performed at the Roman Court, this abridgment received the name of Breviary, which was suitable, since, according to the etymology of the word, it was an abridgment. The name has been extended to books which contain in one volume, {{or at least in}} one work, liturgical books of different kinds, such as the Psalter, the Antiphonary, the Responsoriary, the Lectionary, etc. In this connection it may be pointed out that in this sense <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> <b>as</b> it is used nowadays, is illogical; it should be named a Plenarium rather than a Breviarium, since, liturgically speaking, the word Plenarium exactly designates such books as contain several different compilations united under one cover. This is pointed out, however, simply to make still clearer the meaning and origin of the word; and section V will furnish a more detailed explanation of the formation of the Breviary.|$|E

25|$|The gross {{geography}} of Scania reflect more the preglacial development than the erosion and deposits {{caused by the}} Quaternary glaciers. In Swedish <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>ås</b> commonly refer to eskers but major landmarks in Scania like the Söderåsen are horsts formed by inversion tectonic activity along the Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone in the late Cretaceous. The Scanian horsts run in a north-west to south-east direction, marking the southwest border of Fennoscandia. Tectonic activity of the Sorgenfrei-Tornquist Zone during the break-up of Pangaea in the Jurassic and Cretaceous epochs {{led to the formation}} of hundreds of small volcanoes in central Scania. Remnants of the volcanoes are still visible today. Paralell with volcanism a hilly peneplain formed in northeastern Scania due to weathering and erosion of the basement rocks. The kaolinite formed by this weathering can be observed at Ivö Klack. In the Campanian age of the Late Cretaceous a sea level rise led to the complete drowning of Scania. Subsequently marine sediments burried old surfaces preserving the rocky shores and hilly terrain of the day.|$|E
500|$|McCarthy's methods {{also brought}} on the disapproval and {{opposition}} of many. Barely {{a month after}} McCarthy's Wheeling speech, the term [...] "McCarthyism" [...] was coined by Washington Post cartoonist Herbert Block. Block and others used <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>as</b> a synonym for demagoguery, baseless defamation, and mudslinging. Later, it would be embraced by McCarthy {{and some of his}} supporters. [...] "McCarthyism is Americanism with its sleeves rolled," [...] McCarthy said in a 1952 speech, and later that year, he published a book titled McCarthyism: The Fight For America.|$|E
500|$|In its {{issue of}} October 25, 2005, eight {{days after the}} premiere episode of the Report, The New York Times ran its third article on The Colbert Report, [...] "Bringing Out the Absurdity of the News". The article {{specifically}} discussed the segment on [...] "truthiness", although the Times misreported <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>as</b> [...] "trustiness". In its November 1, 2005 issue, the Times ran a correction. On the next episode of the Report, Colbert took the Times to task for the error, pointing out, ironically, that [...] "trustiness" [...] is [...] "not even a word".|$|E

500|$|The folklorist Percy Maylam {{noted that}} most nineteenth-century sources {{describing}} the tradition had spelled <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>as</b> hoden, {{but that he}} favoured hooden because it better reflected the pronunciation of the word with its long vowel. He added that [...] "the word 'hooden' rhymes with 'wooden' and not with 'sodden' as some writers appear to think". Given this pronunciation, Cawte suggested that oodening was a better spelling for the tradition's name. Maylam also noted {{that none of the}} hoodeners with whom he communicated were aware of the etymology of the term, and that similarly they were unaware of the tradition's historical origins.|$|E
500|$|French is {{occasionally}} {{used throughout}} the story; for example, the series is given the French subtitle La Vierge Marie vous regarde, which means [...] "The Virgin Mary is watching you".

By custom, this greeting is used often in the Lillian School; this {{has been one of the}} distinguishable and popular phrases of the series, and it is used to begin or to finish each volume. The Animax English-language version translates <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>as</b> [...] "good day to you".|$|E
500|$|After {{struggling}} {{for several years}} as an aspiring model/actress, Foulkes became the T-Mobile 4G spokesperson in fall 2010, despite not using the usual American English pronunciation of [...] "mobile" [...] in her summer 2009 audition, but rather pronouncing <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>as</b> rhyming with [...] "smile", an accepted pronunciation more common in Canadian English. Her advertising campaign was at first noted for similarities to the 20062010 Justin Long/John Hodgman [...] "Get a Mac" [...] ads. Foulkes derides the iPhone 4 and its exclusive provider at the time, AT, {{the same way the}} Apple Inc. derided Windows-based personal computers.
