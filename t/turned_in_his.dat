5|$|Alex Cox {{had tried}} to make a Mars Attacks film in the 1980s before Burton and Gems began {{development}} in 1993. When Gems <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first draft in 1994, Warner Bros. commissioned rewrites from Gems, Burton, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski in an attempt to lower the budget to $60 million. The final production budget came to $80 million, while Warner Bros. spent another $20 million on the Mars Attacks! marketing campaign. Filming took place from February to November 1996. The film was shot in California, Nevada, Kansas, Arizona and Argentina. The soundtrack became famous for the Martians' quirky speech pattern, which was created by reversing the sound of a duck's quack.|$|E
5|$|After a 91-minute rain delay, the offenses {{fought back}} and forth, scoring run after run in an up-and-down affair in Philadelphia. Ryan Howard ended his home run drought, hitting his first round-tripper {{since the end}} of September. Chase Utley and Carlos Ruiz also hit home runs for the Phillies, while Carl Crawford and Dioner Navarro contributed a double each for the Rays. Philadelphia starter Jamie Moyer <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first strong {{performance}} of the post-season, allowing three runs over 6⅓ innings. His counterpart Matt Garza allowed four runs over six innings, but neither would factor in the decision. After the Rays tied the game {{in the top of the}} eighth, the Phillies loaded the bases on two intentional walks with Eric Bruntlett on third base. Even with a five-man infield, Ruiz was still able to engineer some late-game heroics, sneaking a dribbling ground ball down the third base line to score Bruntlett. Philadelphia took a 21 series lead.|$|E

Buenaventura was subsequently asked to head the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the Philippine central monetary authority, as central bank governor. The incumbent governor of the BSP, Gabriel C. Singson, had <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> courtesy resignation, but the financial market was already in turmoil following the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Removing the incumbent central bank chief would have added uncertainty in an already jittery market, so Buenaventura promptly turned down the offer.|$|E
25|$|Williams almost {{ended his}} tenure with the Pops in 1984. Considered a {{customary}} practice of opinion, some players hissed while sight-reading a new Williams composition in rehearsal; Williams abruptly left the session and <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> resignation. He initially cited mounting conflicts with his film composing schedule, but later admitted a perceived {{lack of discipline}} in, and respect from, the Pops' ranks, culminating in this latest instance. After entreaties by the management and personal apologies from the musicians, Williams withdrew his resignation and continued as principal conductor for nine more years. In 1995, he was succeeded by Keith Lockhart, the former associate conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and Cincinnati Pops Orchestra.|$|E

25|$|De Forest {{eventually}} came {{into conflict with}} his company's management. His main complaint was the limited support he got for conducting research, while company officials were upset with de Forest's inability to develop a practical receiver free of patent infringement. (This problem was finally resolved with {{the invention of the}} carborundum crystal detector by another company employee, General H. H. Dunworthy). On November 28, 1906, in exchange for $1000 (half of which was claimed by an attorney) and the rights to some early Audion detector patents, de Forest <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> stock and resigned from the company that bore his name. American DeForest was then reorganized as the United Wireless Telegraph Company, and would be the dominant U.S. radio communications firm, albeit propped up by massive stock fraud, until its bankruptcy in 1912.|$|E
25|$|For the 11years before Davie, the Irish were {{coached by}} Lou Holtz. Holtz, who, it was reported, had {{returned}} {{the program to}} excellence, led the team to a national championship in 1988 and had been given, what was reported to be, a lifetime contract by Notre Dame. By his final season, 1996, Holtz had tallied 92wins to put him third on the all-time Notre Dame wins list (only behind Ara Parseghian with 95wins and Knute Rockne with 105wins). Throughout the season there was speculation that Holtz, who passed Parseghian's mark, would retire rather than break Rockne's record, and on November 19, a week before his final home game at Notre Dame, {{it was revealed that}} he <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> letter of resignation to the Notre Dame administration. In his final game at Notre Dame Stadium, where the team shut-out Rutgers 62–0, Holtz got his 100th and final win for the Irish. The Notre Dame administration didn't look far for Holtz's replacement, as their defensive coordinator, Bob Davie, who was hired by Holtz three years previous, was named as his replacement.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his tenure, Gude had private {{pupils in}} {{addition}} to his normal classes. As a professor Gude taught six hours of class, held two hours of office hours, took turns with other professors supervising the nude drawing class and attended staff meetings. In 1857 Gude handed in his resignation, officially citing family considerations and failing health as his reasons for resigning, although in his memoirs he blamed opposition and backbiting from two of his pupils. The landscape painting professorship was the bottom of the pay scale at the Academy, and Gude {{was one of the few}} professors to be refused a raise when others received them in 1855. Others have suggested that Gude wished to leave the Academy for fear for becoming stuck in a rut artistically. Gude received better treatment from the Academy after he <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> resignation, and it would take him a full five years to finally leave Düsseldorf. Although professors at the Academy complained that their teaching prevented them from undertaking more lucrative endeavors, Gude was able to sell enough works to afford a modest house in Düsseldorf which stood in what is now Hofgarten.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{example is}} a 4th November 1801 House of Commons speech by a Mr. Windham warning Britain against giving too much power to France during the preliminaries to peace following the revolutionary wars: [...] "Thus have we done a thing altogether unknown {{in the history of}} this country a thing which would have scared all former politicians a thing, which, if our old Whig politicians were now to hear, they would <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> their graves." [...] One of the earliest uses is found in William Thackeray's 1849 work The History of Pendennis, where Mrs. Wapshot, upset by a man's advances on the widow of Mr. Pendennis whom the widow had [...] "never liked," [...] says it's [...] "enough to make poor Mr. Pendennis <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> grave." [...] Another early use of the phrase is in historian James Bryce's 1888 work The American Commonwealth in which he said: [...] "Jefferson might <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> grave if he knew." [...] It has also been said that circa 1906, when George Bernard Shaw was invited to Henry Irving's funeral, he said [...] "If I were at Westminster, Henry Irving would <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> grave, just as Shakespeare would <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> grave were Henry Irving at Stratford," [...] implying that Irving's productions of Shakespeare would have made the actor as offensive to Shakespeare as Shaw had made himself offensive to Irving with the numerous critical reviews he had written of Irving's work. In 1902, the work Current Literature stated that [...] "William Morris might well <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> grave if he could see the uses to which his fine dreams of beautiful books have been put." [...] Where the sorry state of people's spelling/punctuation/literary skills come under criticism, the act is generally said to make [...] "Shakespeare <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> grave," [...] as he is associated with high literary standards. One example of this is when a national newspaper opined that writing the word [...] "cough" [...] with an [...] "F" [...] would cause such a thing to occur.|$|R

25|$|The Dodgers went on {{the road}} to Citizens Bank Park where Chase Utley had a good game against his former team, the Philadelphia Phillies. He hit two home runs, {{including}} a grand slam, in the Dodgers 15–5 rout. Gonzalez hit two homers in the next game as the Dodgers won, 7–2. Justin Turner hit a three-run homer in the next game but the Phillies came from behind, thanks to homers by Maikel Franco and Ryan Howard to win 5–4 and avoid the sweep. Bud Norris returned from the disabled list to start the opener of a series against the Cincinnati Reds but lasted only 3 innings. Joey Votto hit a three run homer and relief pitcher Michael Lorenzen hit a two-run homer as the Reds won 9–2. Brett Anderson made his second start of the season on August 20 and again was shelled, allowing six runs in three innings before leaving because of a blister. Brandon Finnegan allowed only one hit in seven innings and the Reds routed the Dodgers 11–1. Julio Urías <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> best start as a Dodger to that point in the next game, with six shutout innings, and the Dodgers won 4–0. The Dodgers won a slugfest with the Reds on August 22, 18–9. They hit seven home runs in the game, including three by Adrian Gonzalez. It {{was the first time the}} visiting team at Great American Ballpark had hit seven in one game.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{began their}} first road trip {{of the second}} half of the season in New York City against the Mets on July 20. Kemp and Luis Cruz each slugged two-run homers off Mets starter Johan Santana and the team held on for a 7-6 victory. Juan Uribe, who had {{struggled}} in the first half of the season, broke out in the next game, with a homer, double, two walks, four RBI and three runs scored. Chris Capuano picked up his team leading 10th win in the 8–5 victory. Matt Treanor's pinch hit two-run single in the top of the 12th inning led the Dodgers to an 8–3 victory over the Mets on July 22. The win completed the Dodgers first 3-game series sweep of the Mets in New York since 2002 and gave rookie Josh Wall the win. Wall was the first Dodger to pick up a win in relief in his first appearance since Tim Belcher in 1987. Billingsley came off the disabled list to pitch six solid innings in the Dodgers 5–3 win over the St. Louis Cardinals on July 24. Luis Cruz's three-run homer was main offense in the game. Kershaw struggled in the next game, allowing 8 earned runs, in the Dodgers 8–2 loss to the Cardinals that ended the five-game winning streak. The Dodgers acquired Hanley Ramírez from the Miami Marlins in a trade on July 25 and Ramírez went 2-for-4 with a triple in his Dodgers debut against the Cardinals. It wasn't enough, however, as ex-Dodger Rafael Furcal hit a two-out single to left in the bottom of the 12th to give the Cardinals a 3–2 victory. Chris Capuano <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> worst start of the season in the finale against the Cardinals, as the Dodgers lost 7–4. Ramírez hit his first home run as a Dodger in the opener of a key series against the division leading Giants. The two-run homer, in the top of the 10th inning was the difference in a 5-3 victory. The Dodgers picked up another win against their rivals the next day as Chad Billingsley pitched 7 scoreless innings while allowing only 4 hits and Matt Kemp went 4 for 5 with two doubles and a home run in the 10–0 rout. Kershaw pitched a five-hit complete game shutout to complete the Dodgers sweep of the Giants, 4–0, and move them back into a tie for first place in the division.|$|E

[...] Romney said he was unhappy with presidential candidates who declined to address [...] "the real issues" [...] facing the nation for fear they would lose votes, and said he would form a new national citizens' organization that would attempt to enlighten the public on the most vital topics. [...] He added that he would stay on as secretary until his successor could be appointed and confirmed, and did stay until Nixon's second inauguration on January 20, 1973. [...] Upon his departure, Romney said he looked forward [...] "with great enthusiasm" [...] to his return to private life.|$|E
500|$|France stated {{his vision}} of the film was {{different}} from the other drafts, which based Bruce Banner on his [...] "amiable, nerdy genius" [...] incarnation in the 1960s. France cited inspiration from the 1980s Hulk stories which introduced Brian Banner, Bruce's abusive father who killed his mother. His script had Banner trying to create cells with regenerative capabilities in order to prove to himself that he is not like his father. However, he has anger management issues before the Hulk is even created, which makes everything worse. The [...] "Don't make me angry..." [...] line from the TV series was made into dialogue that Banner's father would say before beating his son. Elements such as the [...] "Gammasphere", Banner's tragic romance with Ross, and the black ops made it to the final film. France <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> final drafts in late 1999-January 2000.|$|E
500|$|In August 1986, {{producer}} Lawrence Gordon {{acquired the}} film rights to Watchmen for 20th Century Fox, with producer Joel Silver {{working on the}} film. Fox asked author Alan Moore to write a screenplay based on his story, but when Moore declined the studio enlisted screenwriter Sam Hamm. On September 9, 1988, Hamm <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first draft, but said that condensing a 338-page, nine-panel-a-page comic book into a 128-page script was arduous. He took the liberty of re-writing Watchmens complicated ending into a [...] "more manageable" [...] conclusion involving an assassination and a time paradox. Fox put the film into turnaround in 1991, and Gordon set up the project at a new company, Largo International, with Fox distributing the film. Although Largo closed three years later, Fox was promised {{that they would be}} involved if the project was revived.|$|E

500|$|Burton became {{attached}} as director, while producer Denise Di Novi {{and writer}} Daniel Waters also returned. In January 1994, Burton was unsure of {{his plans to}} direct Catwoman or an adaptation of [...] "The Fall of the House of Usher". On June 6, 1995, Waters <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Catwoman script to Warner Bros., the same day Batman Forever was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked, [...] "Turning it in the day Batman Forever opened {{may not have been}} my best logistical move, in that it's the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman. Catwoman is definitely not a fun-for-the-whole-family script." [...] In an August 1995 interview, Pfeiffer re-iterated her interest in the spin-off, but explained her priorities would be challenged as a mother and commitments to other projects. The film labored in development hell for years, with Pfeiffer replaced by Ashley Judd. The film ended up becoming the critically panned Catwoman (2004), starring Halle Berry.|$|E
500|$|Golan shelved the low-budget rewrites and {{attempted}} to finance an independent production from the original big-budget script, already budgeted, storyboarded and laid out. At Cannes in May 1989, 21st Century announced a September start date, with ads touting the script by [...] "Barney Cohen, Ted Newsom & John Brancato and Joseph Goldman." [...] As standard practice, Golan pre-sold the unmade film to raise production funds, with television rights bought by Viacom and home video rights by Columbia Pictures, which wanted to establish a studio franchise. Stephen Herek was attached as director at this point. Golan submitted this [...] "new" [...] screenplay to Columbia in late 1989 (actually the 1985 script with an adjusted [...] "1989" [...] date) and the studio requested yet another rewrite. Golan hired Frank LaLoggia, who <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> draft but grew disenchanted with 21st Century. Neil Ruttenberg was hired for one more draft, which was also [...] "covered" [...] by script readers at Columbia. Columbia’s script analysts considered all three submissions [...] "essentially the same story." [...] A tentative production deal was set. Said Stan Lee in 1990, [...] "21st Century [...] supposed to do Spider-Man and now they're talking to Columbia {{and the way it}} looks now, Columbia may end up buying Spider-Man from 21st Century." ...|$|E
500|$|With the {{financial}} and critical success of Jaws, Spielberg earned {{a vast amount of}} creative control from Columbia, including the right to make the film any way he wanted.

It was a terribly guilt-ridden story not about UFOs at all." [...] Titled Kingdom Come, the script's protagonist was a 45-year-old Air Force Officer named Paul Van Owen who worked with Project Blue Book. [...] " [...] job for the government is to ridicule and debunk flying saucers." [...] Schrader continued. [...] "One day he has an encounter. He goes to the government, threatening to blow the lid off to the public. Instead, he and the government spend 15 years trying to make contact." [...] Spielberg and Schrader experienced creative differences, hiring John Hill to rewrite. At one point the main character was a police officer. Spielberg [...] " [...] it hard to identify with men in uniform. I wanted to have Mr. Everyday Regular Fella." [...] Spielberg rejected the Schrader/Hill script during post-production on Jaws. He reflected, [...] "they wanted to make it like a James Bond adventure." ...|$|E
