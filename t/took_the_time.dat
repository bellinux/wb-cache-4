5|$|The poem {{described}} the heroic past of Lithuania and exhorted its people {{to care for}} the land, care for humanity, and live in honor. Kudirka also urged the country to become a source of enlightenment and virtue. Without a melody, Kudirka <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to compose the music just before dying of tuberculosis. Both the melody and the lyrics were printed in Varpas in September 1898. Upon his death in 1899, Kudirka's tomb was engraved with the second stanza of the anthem (later destroyed by the authorities).|$|E
5|$|From 1974 to 1987, Vargas Llosa {{focused on}} his writing, but also <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to pursue other endeavors. In 1975, he co-directed an {{unsuccessful}} motion-picture adaptation of his novel, Captain Pantoja and the Secret Service. In 1976 he was elected President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers and oldest human rights organisation, a position he held until 1979. During this time, Vargas Llosa constantly traveled to speak at conferences organized by internationally renowned institutions, such as the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the University of Cambridge, where he was Simón Bolívar Professor and an Overseas Fellow of Churchill College in 1977–78.|$|E

5|$|Selänne then {{declined}} {{an option}} in his contract {{that would have}} paid $6.5 million in 2003–04 and instead opted to sign a one-year, $5.8 million contract with the Colorado Avalanche, where he was joined by former Anaheim teammate Paul Kariya. The pair chose to sign with the Avalanche together in the belief it was their best chance at winning the Stanley Cup. Their hope failed to materialize, however, as Selänne endured a disastrous season in which he scored only 16 goals and 32 points—the lowest totals of his career to that date—and was ultimately relegated to Colorado's fourth line, but was also held out of the lineup as a healthy scratch during a playoff game. He struggled throughout the year with knee problems that ultimately required surgery, his third such procedure, and with the 2004–05 season canceled by a labour dispute, <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> off to recover.|$|E
5|$|By 22:00, the Rangers and ex-POWs {{arrived at}} Plateros, where they rested {{for half an}} hour. A radio message was sent and {{received}} by Sixth Army at 23:00 that the mission had been a success, {{and that they were}} returning with the rescued prisoners to American lines. After a headcount, it was discovered that POW Edwin Rose, a deaf British soldier, was missing. Mucci dictated that none of the Rangers could be spared to search for him, so he sent several guerrillas {{to do so in the}} morning. It was later learned that Rose had fallen asleep in the latrine before the attack. Rose woke early the next morning, and realized the other prisoners were gone and that he was left behind. Nevertheless, he <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to shave and put on his best clothes that he had been saving for the day he would be rescued. He walked out of the prison camp, thinking that he would soon be found and led to freedom. Sure enough, Rose was found by passing guerrillas. Arrangements were made for a tank destroyer unit to pick him up and transport him to a hospital.|$|E
5|$|During the match, UEFA.com {{users were}} able to vote for their man of the match; the public vote went to the scorer of Barcelona's second goal, Lionel Messi. The UEFA Technical Study Group, however, chose the man who {{provided}} the cross for Messi's goal, Xavi, as their man of the match, citing his control of the tempo of the match {{as the reason for}} their decision. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to give special praise to Messi, whom he said he moved back into the midfield in order to increase the team's effectiveness when in possession of the ball. Messi had been withdrawn from his usual right-wing role into a more central position, while Samuel Eto'o, who had started the match as Barcelona's lone centre-forward, was moved out to the right. Guardiola also lauded the bravery of his entire team, stating that he believed that his team's victory hinged on their hard work and propensity for taking risks in attack, but he admitted that although his side had had the best season {{in the history of the}} club, they were not yet the best Barcelona team.|$|E

25|$|Bolstered by Blues Traveler's {{mainstream}} success, Popper {{released a}} solo album, Zygote, in 1999 and toured {{in support of}} it with his own John Popper Band. The album was produced by Terry Manning, and the backing band consisted of longtime friends Dave Ares, Crugie Riccio, and Rob Clores of Cycomotogoat, with drummer Carter Beauford of Dave Matthews Band. The album's release came {{less than three months}} after his heart surgery, and only days after the death of Bobby Sheehan, Popper's bandmate and best friend.

25|$|In the {{penultimate}} scenario, {{during an}} attempted {{invasion of the}} United States in 2098, General Sergei Molotov finally realizes that Grigor II became mad with power, and deserts. Cooperating with U.S. agent Molly Ryan, he re-enacts the Chinese plan, building a time machine and returning to 2018 in order to set things right. They arrived {{just a few minutes}} late, as Grigor already left Voronezh. In addition, Grigor II realized their plans and <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> machine, fortifying Volgograd with a sizeable detachment of cybernetic forces. A massive battle ensued, ending in the technologically horribly outmatched Molotov and Ryan destroying Grigor II and assassinating Grigor (who proved to be unreasonable due to knowledge of Novaya Russia's military might).|$|E
25|$|In 1918, several station {{owners and}} {{businessmen}} abandoned the Territory, including {{the manager of}} the State Liquor Department, because of Gilruth's policies. However, the mistake that helped finish Gilruth's career in the Territory, was trivial. As Darwinites prepared to celebrate the end of the war, the women employed in the state hotels asked for a few hours off on Saturday, 14 November to join in the celebrations. The hotel boarders agreed to dine elsewhere and everybody presumed the matter was closed. However, Gilruth subsequently refused to concede leave for the women, who <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> off anyway. When they returned to work the next day, they found themselves locked out by order of the Administrator. It was also reported that Gilruth refused permission for a ship to unload 700 cases of beer for the town's Christmas supplies.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the third}} quarter commenced, the Seahawks <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to move the ball deep into the Dallas red zone. They were stopped on third down at the Dallas 7, and elected to go for their third field goal. This drive took 5:23, the longest drive thus far in the game. On Dallas' next possession, cornerback Marcus Trufant intercepted an endzone pass that was {{intended}} for wideout Terrell Owens. The Seahawks offense was unable {{to capitalize on the}} turnover, as they were unable to convert for the first down. Dallas followed with an unsuccessful drive that ended on their second punt of the game. The Seahawks faced their second three-and-out of the quarter on their ensuing possession; their punt led Dallas to field their offense at the Dallas 44. After two plays, Romo threw to Owens for a 33-yard gain. Owens scored a touchdown off a 19-yard catch on the next play, extending the Cowboys' lead to 31–9. Seattle failed again to produce a score during the two minutes left in {{the third quarter}}.|$|E
25|$|Don {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with the Dodgers on February 16, 1959 for $8,500. At the Dodgers camp in Vero Beach, Florida, Demeter <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to try to reinvent himself as a hitter. He was always going for the home run swing, which resulted in 32 strikeouts in just 106 at bats last season. Manager Walter Alston and new coach Pee Wee Reese would be his teachers. Reese stated that Don was upper-cutting at the ball with each swing, and Pee Wee had him cut down on his swing, which led to immediate results. Alston had Demeter stand outside the batting cage and hit ground balls to the infielders while waiting for his turn in the cage. Don and Alston agreed that the simple exercise helped level off Demeter's swing. While adapting his new batting style, Demeter injured himself on February 27 by pulling a muscle in his right leg. It was not serious, and Demeter returned to spring training play {{in less than a}} week. On March 12, he had a game-winning single with the bases loaded against the Cincinnati Reds in the 9th inning to give the Dodgers the 7-6 win.|$|E

Two weeks after the case, during the weekly Tuesday staff conference at his employers, The Sunday Times, Fleming suffered a serious, second heart attack that necessitated convalescence, which he undertook at the Dudley Hotel in Hove.
