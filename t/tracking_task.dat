Impairment of performance is seen at BACs of as little as 0.7 milligrams per milliliter (mg/ml)." [...] Another form of tests is a choice reaction task, which deals more primarily with cognitive function. In this form of testing both hearing and vision are tested and drivers must give a [...] "response according to rules that necessitate mental processing before giving the answer." [...] This is a useful gauge because in an actual driving situation drivers must divide their attention [...] "between a <b>tracking</b> <b>task</b> and surveillance of the environment." [...] It has been found that even [...] "very low BACs are sufficient to produce significant impairment of performance" [...] in this area of thought process.|$|E

50|$|The model {{assumes that}} a perceptual signal within the {{participant}} represents {{the magnitude of}} the input quantity qi. (This has been demonstrated to be a rate of firing in a neuron, at least at the lowest levels.) In the <b>tracking</b> <b>task,</b> the input quantity is the vertical distance between the target position T and the cursor position C, and the random variation of the target position acts as the disturbance d of that input quantity. This suggests that the perceptual signal p quantitatively represents the cursor position C minus the target position T, as expressed in the equation p=C - T.|$|E

40|$|Visual {{feedback}} {{is a crucial}} factor to motor function, and a few parameters, such as gain, delay and frequency, can influence the motor output. Here presented a behavioral study {{on the effect of}} visual feedback gain to movement by measuring the grasp force output under different visual feedback gain. Two force <b>track</b> <b>tasks</b> with different increasing/decreasing force rate have been designed, and 12 participants have been recruited in this experiment. Force deviation and error rate produced by participants have been detected under different gains. The statistical analysis revealed that gain of visual stimuli can influence force output significantly. For the same force <b>track</b> <b>task,</b> visual feedback with high gain can enhance the regulation of force production. The results suggested that different visual feedback gains may recruit different cortex function area to execute different motor tasks...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Cognitive {{impairment}} is a core {{feature of}} schizophrenia, related to dopaminergic dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). It is hypothesized that functional {{single nucleotide polymorphism}} (SNP) rs 4680 of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene could mediate the relationship between cognition and dopamine activity in the PFC. Other COMT SNPs could also play a role. Methods: We evaluated the role of three COMT SNPs (rs 737865, rs 165599, and rs 4680) in schizophrenia {{and their impact on}} three working memory tasks. For genetic association analyses, 212 individuals with schizophrenia and 257 healthy controls (HCs) were selected. The Visual Working Memory (VWM) <b>Task,</b> Keep <b>Track</b> <b>Task,</b> and Letter Memory Task were administered to 133 schizophrenics and 93 HCs. Results: We found a significant association of rs 737865, with the GG genotype exerting a protective effect and the GA haplotype (rs 4680 /rs 165599) exerting a risk effect for schizophrenia. COMT rs 4680 AA carriers and rs 737865 AA carriers scored lowest on the Keep <b>Track</b> <b>Task.</b> When the genotype*group interaction effect was evaluated, rs 165599 exerted opposite effects for VWM and Keep <b>Track</b> <b>task</b> performance in patients and controls, with AA carriers scoring lowest on both tests among controls, but highest among patients. Conclusion: These data support the hypothesis that COMT polymorphisms may be associated with schizophrenia and modulate cognition in patients and controls...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) polarity depending on lateralized function of task property in normal individuals performing visuomotor and simple repetitive tasks. Thirty healthy participants with no neurological disorders were recruited {{to participate in this}} study. Participants were randomly allocated into active or control condition. For the active condition, tDCS intensity was 2 mA with stimulation applied for 15 minutes to the right hemisphere (tDCS condition). For the sham control, electrodes were placed in the same position, but the stimulator was turned off after 30 seconds (sham condition). The tapping and <b>tracking</b> <b>task</b> tests were performed before and after for both conditions. Univariate analysis revealed significant difference only in the <b>tracking</b> <b>task.</b> For direct comparison of both tasks within each group, the <b>tracking</b> <b>task</b> had significantly higher Z score than the tapping task in the tDCS group (P < 0. 05). Thus, our study indicates that stimulation of the right hemisphere using tDCS can effectively improve visuomotor (<b>tracking)</b> <b>task</b> over simple repetitive (tapping) task...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of computer games peripherals {{to measure the}} motor dysfunction in Parkinson’s diseases is assessed. Of particular interest is the quantification of bradykinesia. Previous studies used modified or custom haptic interfaces, here an unmodified force feedback joystick and steering wheel are used with a laptop. During testing an on screen cursor moves in response to movements of the peripheral, the user has to track a continuously moving target (pursuit tracking), or move to a predetermined target (step <b>tracking).</b> All <b>tasks</b> use movement in the horizontal axis, allowing use of joystick or steering wheel. Two pursuit <b>tracking</b> <b>tasks</b> are evaluated, pseudo random movement, and a swept frequency <b>task.</b> Two step <b>tracking</b> <b>tasks</b> are evaluated, movement between two or between two of five fixed targets. Thirteen patients and five controls took part on a weekly basis. Patients were assessed for bradykinesia at each session using standard clinical measures. A range of quantitative measures was developed to allow comparison between and within patients and controls using ANOVA. Both peripherals are capable of discriminating between controls and patients, and between patients with different levels of bradykinesia. Recommendations for test procedures and peripherals are given...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the nonlinear friction and compensation for a piezoelectric ceramic ultrasonic motor (USM). Although the architecture of the USM is different from the general electric-mechanical motor, the mathematic model for the USM motor can use the same friction model to formulate the friction phenomenon. To establish the feed-forward controller, the system identification for the USM is needed to study to design the model-based controller. To obtain the optimal system parameters of the USM, PSO and CSS algorithms are studied to identify the system parameters for the nonlinear friction model. For the controller design, a non-model based controller, using back-propagation neural network controller to perform <b>tracking</b> <b>tasks,</b> and the model-based controller, which consists of the feed-forward controller based on the system identification and the sliding-mode control, are discussed in this paper.
