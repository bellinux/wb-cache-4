Welcome too is that hard-wrung Union of Avignon; which has cost us, first and last, 'thirty {{sessions}} of debate,' {{and so much}} else: may it at length prove lucky! Rousseau's statue is decreed: virtuous Jean-Jacques, Evangelist of the Contrat Social. Not Drouet of Varennes; nor worthy Lataille, master of the old world-famous Tennis Court in Versailles, is forgotten; but each has his honourable mention, and due reward in money. (Moniteur in Hist. Parl. xi. 473.) Whereupon, things being all so neatly winded up, and the Deputations, and Messages, and royal and other Ceremonials having rustled by; and the King having now affectionately perorated about peace and <b>tranquilisation,</b> and members having answered [...] "Oui! oui!" [...] with effusion, even with tears,--President Thouret, he of the Law Reforms, rises, and, with a strong voice, utters these memorable last-words: [...] "The National Constituent Assembly declares that it has finished its mission; and that its sittings are all ended." [...] Incorruptible Robespierre, virtuous Petion are borne home {{on the shoulders of}} the people; with vivats heaven-high. The rest glide quietly to their respective places of abode. It is the last afternoon of September, 1791; on the morrow morning the new Legislative will begin.|$|E
50|$|Green {{hunting or}} eco-hunting is the {{practice}} of hunting game animals with tranquiliser dart guns and the subsequent release of the live animals. Green hunting would typically be performed when <b>tranquilisation</b> of the animal is necessary for veterinary or monitoring purposes, or when animals are to be translocated. Green hunting has been advocated as a conservation-minded alternative to destructive hunting. However, criticism has sprung up over the possibility that {{in the interest of}} generating revenue, particular animals may undergo <b>tranquilisation</b> too frequently, with a case alleged where <b>tranquilisation</b> occurred once every two weeks, and the suggestion that this may be traumatising to the animals, with consequences poorly studied.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 2000s a {{government}} report heavily criticised {{the standards of}} accommodation and care at the hospital. A patient had also died in 1999 after being administered a rapid <b>tranquilisation</b> when medical checks hadn't been carried out correctly. By April 2003 {{the vast majority of}} the 1,200 patients had been relocated to other mental health facilities, with only 100 expected to remain in a new unit on the site. Carmarthenshire Council purchased the old hospital buildings in 2003, at a cost of £3 million, to prevent the national government using them to house asylum seekers.|$|E
50|$|It {{remains that}} {{training}} is not universally or consistently offered to healthcare workers (Beech and Leather 2006). Beale et al. (1998) {{found that the}} levels of training offered ranged from nothing to high-level restraint/self-defense training. A report by the National Audit Office (NAO) in 2003 found that, within mental health trusts, a reactionary approach tends to prioritise over prevention. Although criticised by many; restraint, seclusion and medication are used (Wright 1999, Gudjonsson et al. 2004) (Duxbury and Whittington 2005). Breakaway techniques, restraint, rapid <b>tranquilisation</b> or isolation tend to be recommended when violence is instigated with a failure to prevent aggression (Duxbury and Whittington 2005). This correlates {{to the level of}} training offered, which dominates in these areas, however lacks in situation risk assessment and customer care (Beech and Leather 2006)-methods that are vital in a preventative approach to prevent escalation of the situation, causing for reactionary measures to be brought into play.|$|E
40|$|Background: Needle stick {{injuries}} are a known {{risk in the}} acute hospital setting especially where the patient is agitated. The emotional burden on the staff experiencing this occupational injury is well reported, however there is insufficient data to support storing pre-filled syringes, out of the manufacturer’s pack for longer than for immediate administration. Aim: The aim {{was to investigate the}} stability and sterility of zuclopenthixol acetate and haloperidol in pre-filled syringes to allow their use as an alternative to drawing the dose from an ampoule or vial prior to administration. Method: Two of the commonly used products in rapid <b>tranquilisation</b> were aseptically drawn in suitable syringes and tested for stability and sterility to establish shelf-life. Ten invited medical and nursing staff involved in rapid <b>tranquilisation</b> were invited to a focus group for feedback on the product practicality of use, cost and logistics of stock management. Results: The stability and sterility tests show that zuclopenthixol acetate and haloperidol retained stability and sterility when stored under 25 °C in a 3 mL disposable plastic syringes, for a period of 60 days with cost of AU$ 67 and AU$ 30 per syringe respectively. Conclusion: The prefilled syringes provide ease and speed of administration, potential reduction in needle-stickinjuries and proved to maintain sterility. This study demonstrated that zuclopenthixol acetate 150 mg/ 3 mL and haloperidol 15 mg/ 3 mL retained stability and remained sterile when stored under 2 - 8 °C in plastic syringes for a period of 60 days. However the proposal was not adopted as dose flexibility was considered a greater priority than the safety gains...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Conventional {{antipsychotics}} augmented with benzodiazepines {{have been}} the standard acute treatment for psychiatric emergencies for more than 50 years. The inability of patients to give informed consent limits randomised, controlled studies. This observational study on immediate therapy for aggression and impulse control in acutely agitated patients (IMPULSE) evaluated the short-term effectiveness and tolerability of atypical and typical antipsychotic medications (AP) in a non-interventional setting. Methods This was a comparative, non-randomised, prospective, open-label, observational study. Treatment over the first 5 days was classified according to whether any olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol was included or not. Documentations (PANSS-excited component, CGI-aggression, CGI-suicidality, <b>tranquilisation</b> score) were at baseline (day 1) and days 2 – 6 after start of AP. Results During the short treatment-period, PANSS-EC and CGI-aggression scores improved in all cohorts. 68. 7 % of patients treated with olanzapine, 72. 2 % of patients treated with risperidone, and 83. 3 % of patients treated with haloperidol received concomitant benzodiazepines (haloperidol vs. non-haloperidol: p Conclusion Current medication practices for immediate aggression control are effective with positive results present within a few days. In this study, concomitant benzodiazepine use was significantly more frequent in patients receiving haloperidol. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background In the United Kingdom, {{mental health}} nurses (MHNs) can {{independently}} prescribe medication {{once they have}} completed a training course. This study investigated attitudes to mental health nurse prescribing held by psychiatrists and nurses. Method 119 MHNs and 82 psychiatrists working in South-East England were randomly sampled. Participants completed a newly created questionnaire. This included individual item statements with 6 -point likert scales to test levels of agreement which were summated into 7 subscales. Results Psychiatrists had significantly less favourable, albeit generally positive attitudes than MHNs regarding general beliefs (63 % vs. 70 %, p < 0. 001), impact (62 % vs. 70 %, p < 0. 001), uses (60 % vs. 71 %, p < 0. 001), clinical responsibility (69 % vs. 62 %, p < 0. 001) and legal responsibility (71 % vs. 64 %, p < 0. 001). More MHNs than psychiatrists believed that nurse prescribing would be useful in emergency situations for rapid <b>tranquilisation</b> (82 % vs. 37 %, p < 0. 001), and that the consultant psychiatrist should have ultimate clinical responsibility for prescribing by an MHN (42 % vs. 28 %, p < 0. 001). Approximately half of all participants agreed nurse prescribing would create conflict in clinical teams. Conclusions The majority of both groups were in favour of mental health nurse prescribing, although significantly more psychiatrists expressed concerns. This {{may be explained by}} a perceived change in power balance...|$|E
40|$|A lateral tail vein {{of the rat}} is used as {{the route}} for {{continuous}} infusion. The animal is kept under neuroleptic <b>tranquilisation</b> during the infusion. 69 Various methods {{have been developed for}} the continuous infusion of animals. The jugular vein can easily be cannulated, the tube being fixed by means of a subcutaneous tunnel (Dalton, Touraine & Wilson, 1969; Evans, 1970; Harris, 1974). Bezman (1969) cannulated the femoral vein. The continuity of the infusion has been ascertained by relaxing the animal (Bezman, 1969) or by protecting the tube either mechanically or electrically (Dalton et al., 1969; Edmonds & Thompson, 1970). Earlier techniques included an operation during which the cannula was inserted. The purpose of this work was to develop a simple method for continuous intravenous infusion with minimal traumatisation of the rat. MATERIALS AND METHODS Male Wistar rats weighing 250 - 300 g were used. The anaesthesia was started with light ether anaesthesia, during which a lateral tail vein was cannulated. Then droperidol (1 mg/kg) was injected via the cannula and the animal stayed calm for the initiation of the infusion. Droperidol was infused continuously during the experiment at a rate of 0 · 16 mgjkgjh. Simultaneously 40 i. u. jkg heparin was given for an hour. The tail was cleaned with ethanol (70 % wjw) and light venous compression was applied to fill the tail veins. A lateral tail vein was punctured with a sterile needle, through which a cannula was inserted as long as resistance appeared (Fig. 1). The needle was then removed and the cannula was fixed to the tail with adhesive tape...|$|E
40|$|Through the Safer Wards project we {{aimed to}} reduce the number of {{incidents}} of physical violence on older people’s mental health wards. This was done using quality improvement methods and supported by the Trust’s extensive programme of quality improvement, including training provided by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. Violence can be an indicator of unmet needs in this patient population, with a negative effect on patient care and staff morale. Reducing harm to patients and staff is a strategic aim of our Trust. We established a multi-disciplinary group who led on the project on each ward and used a Pareto diagram to establish the focus of our work. We established a dashboard of measures based on our incident reporting system Datix, including number of incidents of violence, days between incidents, days of staff sickness, days between staff injury, use of restraint, and use of rapid <b>tranquilisation</b> (the last two being balancing measures in the reduction of violence). Each team identified factors driving physical violence on the wards, under headings of unmet patient needs, staff needs and staff awareness, which included lack of activity and a safe and therapeutic environment. Using driver diagrams, we identified change ideas that included hourly rounding (proactive checks on patient well-being), the addition of sensory rooms, flexible leave for patients, and a structured activity programme. We also introduced exercise to music, therapeutic groups led by patients, and focused on discharge planning and pet therapy, each of which starting sequentially over the course of a one year period from late 2013 and subject to a cycle of iterative learning using PDSA methods. The specific aim was a 20 % decrease in violent incidents on three wards in City and Hackney, and Newham. Following our interventions, day...|$|E
40|$|Background: Acute {{behavioural}} disturbance (ABD) {{is a common}} problem in psychiatry and both physical restraint and involuntary parenteral sedation are often required to control patients. Although guidelines are available, clinical practice is often guided by experience {{and there is little}} agreement on which drugs should be first-line treatment for rapid <b>tranquilisation.</b> This study aimed to investigate sedation for ABD in an acute mental healthcare unit, including the effectiveness and safety of high dose sedation. Methods: A prospective study of parenteral sedation for ABD in mental health patients was conducted from July 2010 to June 2011. Drug administration (type, dose, additional doses), time to sedation, vital signs and adverse effects were recorded. High dose parenteral sedation was defined as greater than the equivalent of 10 mg midazolam, droperidol or haloperidol (alone or in combination), compared to patients receiving 10 mg or less (normal dose). Effective sedation was defined as a fall in the sedation assessment tool score by two or a score of zero or less. Outcomes included frequency of adverse drug effects, time to sedation/tranquilisation and use of additional sedation. Results: Parenteral sedation was given in 171 cases. A single drug was given in 96 (56 %), including droperidol (74), midazolam (19) and haloperidol (3). Effective sedation occurred in 157 patients (92 %), and the median time to sedation was 20 min (Range: 5 to 100 min). The median time to sedation for 93 patients receiving high dose sedation was 20 min (5 - 90 min) compared to 20 min (5 - 100 min; p = 0. 92) for 78 patients receiving normal dose sedation. Adverse effects occurred in 16 patients (9 %); hypotension (14), oxygen desaturation (1), hypotension and oxygen desaturation (1). There were more adverse effects in the high dose sedation group compared to the normal dose group [11 / 93 (12 %) vs. 5 / 78 (6 %); p = 0. 3]. Additional sedation was given in 9 of 171 patients (5 %), seven in the high dose and two in the normal dose groups. Conclusions: Large initial doses of sedative drugs were used for ABD in just over half of cases and additional sedation was uncommon. High dose sedation did not result in more rapid or effective sedation but was associated with more adverse effects...|$|E
40|$|Violence by in{{patients}} against {{mental health}} personnel, fellow patients and people uninvolved in the patientâ€™s treatment {{is a common}} and universal problem requiring urgent attention. The current study sought to investigate factors that are important or considered important by health personnel in making crucial decisions about emergency interventions in aggressive and violent inpatients in a mental institution in Zimbabwe. In particular, the study was intended to address three major objectives namely to identify factors relevant in influencing mental health workersâ€™wide range of interventions in response to inpatient aggressive behaviour and violent incidents; to establish {{the degree to which}} mental health workers recognise factors that influence their management and treatment of violent behaviours in emergency situations and to determine the weight of importance attached to each factor identified by mental health workers as being important in their management and treatment of aggressive and violent behaviours. By so doing, the study sought to lay foundations {{for the development of a}} checklist for mental health personnel on how to proceed in unexpected occurrence of aggressive and violent incidents in mental health wards. A quantitative descriptive research design was used in the current study. The data involved information collected from questionnaire surveys in the mental hospitalâ€™s four purposively selected wards and direct observations in Khumalo ward. The health personnel were observed as they attempt to deal with aggressive and violent incidents in emergency. They also filled in questionnaires purposively distributed in the wards at a particular time. The data collected through the questionnaire and Management and Treatment Observation Table (MTOT) were analysed descriptively using SPSS version 15. 00. Qualitative data from open-ended questions were entered into SPSS as string variables, thematically analysed and post coded. Results have shown that health workers tend to rely on the use of per rising need (PRN) injection and seclusion in the management and treatment of violent and aggressive patients. As a result, number of staff present and availability of drugs became the major factors in the management and treatment efforts. Equally critical factors were found to be perceived dangerousness of aggressor, patient diagnosis, history of violence, phase of patient illness, location violent behaviour takes place, and experience, age and motivation of health worker. In the management and treatment violent patients, the health personnel in Khumalo ward need to go beyond the confines of restraining, seclusion, and rapid <b>tranquilisation</b> (RT). Even though the medical approach of RT effectively stabilised violent patients in the short term, knowledge and practice of behaviour medication techniques will be an invaluable tool for the health personnel. A clear guideline on the identification of behaviour requiring emergency responses and how to proceed in case of such emergency is imperative. A check list will be an invaluable tool for use by health personnel on duty in case of the occurrence of a violent incident...|$|E
