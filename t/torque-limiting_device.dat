50|$|Toggle torque {{wrenches}} (friction-style) and beam wrenches (spring-style) {{are the most}} common types in dentistry as manual mechanical <b>torque-limiting</b> <b>devices.</b> Beam type wrenches in general are more consistent to its calibration than toggle types. The beam types with a dial indicator are the most precise to set the Tare torque (zero point reset). Because steam sterilization processes like an autoclave are applied to the dental {{torque wrenches}} and the length of time in use presents stress on the material, fatigue can occur.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of {{how to use the}} Mechanical <b>Torque-Limiting</b> <b>Devices.</b> Materials and methods: Three different implant manufacturers (Dentium, Osstem, Shinhung) were prepared for each two implant torque controllers. Divided into two groups depending on the method used for removal torque was measured. Repeated measures of ANOVA test (α=. 05) was used as statistics to evaluate the effect of repeated loading number on the removal torque. Independent t-test was used to evaluate the difference in removal torque of two groups. Results: The removal torque significantly decreased as the number of loading repetition increased (P<. 05). There was significant difference between two groups. Conclusion: Loosen the handle part of the implant torque controllers spring resilience to recover one group compared to the group that did not, showed a little more closed to the reference value.

50|$|A {{micrometer}} {{reading is}} not accurate if the thimble is over- or under-torqued. A useful feature of many micrometers is {{the inclusion of}} a <b>torque-limiting</b> <b>device</b> on the thimble—either a spring-loaded ratchet or a friction sleeve. Without this device, workers may overtighten the micrometer on the work, causing the mechanical advantage of the screw to tighten the screw threads or squeeze the material, giving an inaccurate measurement. However, with a thimble that will ratchet or friction slip at a certain torque, the micrometer will not continue to advance once sufficient resistance is encountered. This results in greater accuracy and repeatability of measurements—most especially for low-skilled or semi-skilled workers, who may not have developed the light, consistent touch of a skilled user.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityThe internal fixation of fractures in bone {{with the aid of}} plates and screws is a common procedure in orthopaedic surgery. The prevention of over-tightening is entirely dependent upon the skill and judgement of the surgeon. The research reported here proposed two independent methods for the prevention of overtightening of orthopaedic screws. The first method developed by this research was a mathematical model for predicting the maximum torque that may be applied to a screw before over-tightening occurs. Use of the model would allow surgeons to set a <b>torque-limiting</b> <b>device</b> to prevent over-tightening during surgery. The model would also allow the surgeon to predict the maximum pullout force that screwlbone interface can withstand before failure occurs. The second method developed in this research to prevent over-tightening was the automated screwdriver. It was shown that the automated screwdriver could detect the onset of tightening thus preventing over-tightening without the aid of the mathematical model. The automated screwdriver was demonstrated to perform the following tasks:- (i) Pre-tapping (ii) Tightening of non-self-tapping and self-tapping screws. (iii) Insertion of self-drilling external screws. This research has conclusively demonstrated that both the proposed methods for the prevention of over-tightening orthopaedic screws are a contribution to orthopaedic surgery. The Author recommends that the mathematical model and the automated screwdriver are both further developed to prevent over-tightening and increase the speed and safety of screw insertion in surgery...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Accurate {{delivery}} of torque to implant screws {{is critical to}} generate ideal preload in the screw joint and to offer protection against screw loosening. Mechanical <b>torque-limiting</b> <b>devices</b> (MTLDs) are available for this reason. In this study, the accuracy of one type of friction-style and two types of spring-style MTLDs at baseline, following fatigue conditions and sterilization processes were determined. Materials and Methods: Five unused MTLDs were selected from each of Strau-mann (ITI), Astra TECH and CWM systems. To measure the output of each MTLD, a digital torque gauge with a 3 -jaw chuck was used to hold the driver. Force {{was applied to the}} MTLDs until either the friction styles released at a pre-calibrated torque value or the spring styles flexed to a pre-calibrated limit (target torque value). The peak torque value was recorded and the procedure was re-peated 5 times for each MTLD. Then MTLDs were subjected to fatigue condi-tions at 500 and 1000 times and steam sterilization processes at 50 and 100 time...|$|R
