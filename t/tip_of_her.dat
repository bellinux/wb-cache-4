5|$|Apart from pit-trap-forming taxa, {{the biology}} {{of members of the}} family Myrmeleontidae, to which the antlions belong, has been little studied. The {{life-cycle}} begins with oviposition (egg-laying) in a suitable location. The female antlion repeatedly taps the prospective laying site with the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> abdomen and then inserts her ovipositor into the substrate and lays an egg.|$|E
5|$|Females {{typically}} {{lay between}} {{four hundred and}} three thousand eggs. The eggs are often dropped {{onto the surface of}} the water; sometimes the female deposits them by dipping the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> abdomen into the water during flight, releasing a small batch of eggs each time, or deposits them in bulk while standing next to the water. In a few species, the female submerges and places the eggs among plants or in crevices underwater, but in general, they sink to the bottom. The incubation time is variable, depending at least in part on temperature, and may be anything from a few days to nearly a year. Eggs can go into a quiet dormant phase or diapause. The larval growth rate is also temperature-dependent, as is the number of moults. At anywhere between ten and fifty, these post-embryonic moults are more numerous in mayflies than in most other insect orders. The nymphal stage of mayflies may last from several months to several years, depending on species and environmental conditions.|$|E

25|$|The {{doctor will}} perform a {{neurological}} examination to assess nerve function and motor and sensory skills. The tests {{are designed to}} determine any functional limitations, such as difficulty with handwriting {{or the ability to}} hold a utensil or cup.

25|$|Early the {{following}} morning, the destroyer suffered {{a series of}} shattering internal explosions. By 06:50, she took on a 16° starboard list; and explosions, mostly in the ammunition stowage areas, continued to stagger the stricken destroyer. Then, at about 07:50, a singularly violent explosion caused her to capsize and sink. The <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bow remained above water until about 08:27 when she disappeared completely taking with her 15 officers and 123 men.|$|E

500|$|Like other requiem sharks, the {{silvertip shark}} is viviparous; once the embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the {{depleted}} yolk sac develops into a placental connection {{through which the}} mother delivers nourishment. In the Southern Hemisphere, mating and parturition both occur in summer. Courtship involves the male biting the female to hold her for copulation; one female observed had the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> first dorsal fin bitten off from such activity. Females bear litters of one to 11 (usually five or six) young after a gestation period of about one year, on a biennial cycle. The newborns {{have been reported to}} measure [...] and [...] long by different authors, and are found in shallower water than adults. The growth rate is highly variable in the wild: Kato and Hernandez (1967) reported juvenile silvertip sharks grow an average of , or 5.3% of their body length, per year, with some individuals growing as much as , 30.1% of their body length) per year and others showing negative [...] "growth". Males have been reported to be sexually mature at [...] or [...] long, and females at [...] long.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this time}} Gordon collaborated with other musicians on side projects. With Scott Miller, she co-wrote the song [...] "The Softest <b>Tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>Her</b> Baby Tongue", which {{appeared}} on The Loud Family's 1996 album Interbabe Concern. She worked with James Iha on the Smashing Pumpkins song [...] "...Said Sadly" [...] (the B-side to their 1995 single [...] "Bullet With Butterfly Wings"), and also recorded duets with Fig Dish and Triplefastaction.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{significant}} artistic and historical contribution made to ballet by Flore et Zéphire, however, was dancing sur les pointes (on the toes). [...] Speculation suggests this unusual feat {{was accomplished by}} the ballerina momentarily posing on the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> toe as the flying machine took her weight for suspended flight. [...] Maria Danilova, Geneviève Gosselin and [...] all performed Flore and were noted for dancing sur les pointes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{foraging}} bee... {{begins to}} perform a kind of [...] "round dance". On {{the part of the}} comb where she is sitting she starts whirling around in a narrow circle, constantly changing her direction, turning now right, now left, dancing clockwise and anti-clockwise, in quick succession, describing between one and two circles in each direction. This dance is performed among the thickest bustle of the hive. What makes it so particularly striking and attractive is the way it infects the surrounding bees; those sitting next to the dancer start tripping after her, always trying to keep their outstretched feelers on close contact with the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> abdomen.... They take part in each of her manoeuvrings so that the dancer herself, in her mad wheeling movements, appears to carry behind her a perpetual comet’s tail of bees.|$|E
2500|$|By 1620, the Mayflower was aging, {{nearing the}} end of the usual working life of an English {{merchant}} ship in that era, some 15 years. No dimensions of her hull can be stated exactly, since this was many years before such measurements were standardized. She probably measured about 100 feet (30 m) in length from the forward end at the beak of her prow to the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> stern superstructure aft. She was about 25 feet (7.6 m) at her widest point, with the bottom of her keel about 12 feet (3.6 m) below the waterline. Although William Bradford [...] was not a mariner, he estimated that Mayflower had a cargo capacity of 180 tons. [...] What is known on the basis of surviving records from that time is that she could certainly accommodate 180 casks of wine in her cargo hold. The casks were great barrels that each held hundreds of gallons of claret wine.|$|E
2500|$|Police {{physician}} Thomas Bond, {{disagreed with}} Brown's {{assessment of the}} killer's skill level. Bond's report to police stated: [...] "In each case the mutilation was inflicted by {{a person who had}} no scientific nor anatomical knowledge. In my opinion he does not even possess the technical knowledge of a butcher or horse slaughterer or any person accustomed to cut up dead animals." [...] Local surgeon Dr George William Sequeira, who was the first doctor at the scene, and City medical officer William Sedgwick Saunders, who was also present at the autopsy, also thought that the killer lacked anatomical skill and did not seek particular organs. In addition to the abdominal wounds, the murderer had cut Eddowes' face: across the bridge of the nose, on both cheeks, and through the eyelids of both eyes. The <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> nose and part of one ear had been cut off. The Royal London Hospital on Whitechapel Road preserves some crime scene drawings and plans of the Mitre Square murder by the City Surveyor Frederick Foster; they were first brought to public attention in 1966 by Francis Camps, Professor of Forensic Medicine at London University. Based on his analysis of the surviving documents, Camps concluded that [...] "the cuts shown on the body could not have been done by an expert." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to MTV News, {{the video}} was well {{received}} by fans, who praised its simplicity and Knowles [...] "bumpin belly". For the week ending October 29, 2011, the music video for [...] "Countdown" [...] debuted at {{number one on}} Yahoo! Video chart. The writers of Stereogum ranked it at number one on their year-end list of the best music videos of 2011. The video was placed on Pitchfork Media's unranked list of The Top Music Videos of 2011, and at number four {{on the list of}} Consequence of Sound's staff, who wrote: [...] "The flawless makeup and choreography coupled (yes, that was intentional) with calculatedly goofy facial expressions and dancing maintain the tenuous balance between idol Sasha Fierce and Bey, the girl next door. It proves to her audience that even though Beyoncé is rapidly ascending the celebrity ladder to an almost untouchable height, she's just like any other girl who secretly wants to be Audrey Hepburn in Funny Face." [...] The writers of Slant Magazine put the music video at number 17 on their list of The 25 Best Music Videos of 2011, writing that [...] "using jolts of pop-art colors, virtuosic editing, and a smile that spans from one <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bob cut to the other, Beyoncé pilfers through a very specific musical past with her customarily giddy and sincere sense of spirit." [...] Jesse Skinner	of Toro magazine put the music video at number 14 on his list of Best Videos of 2011 and noted that the video was [...] "the most energetic clip of the year, a utilization of all things – colour, composition, movement, editing – that used to make major label music videos 'events.'" [...] Phoebe Reilly of Spin ranked the video at number nine on Spins 10 Most Innovative Music Videos of 2011 list, writing that Knowles looked [...] "damn adorable" [...] while channeling Audrey Hepburn. NMEs writers included [...] "Countdown"'s music video at number eight on their list of 50 Best Music Videos of 2011 praising the rolling, multiple split screens as its highlight. In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the video at number four on their list of Knowles' ten best music videos, writing that the star of the video is her growing Blue Ivy baby bump. As of January 2015, Billboard named the video as the sixth best music video of the 2010s (so far).|$|E
