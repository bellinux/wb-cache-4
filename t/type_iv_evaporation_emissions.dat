It {{has been suggested that}} <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagenase degrades <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen, a main component of the basement membrane. MethodsIn our study, <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagenase activity in human thyroid tumours was measured by the Liotta method. The degree of destruction of diseased regions of thyroid tumours was immunohistochemically determined by anti-type IV collagen antibody staining. Cell proliferation in the tumours was estimated using anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). ResultsT 4 thyroid carcinomas with higher <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagenase activity and very weak <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> discontinuous immunostaining for <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen of follicular basement membranes, exhibited many PCNA or EGFR positive cells. In benign tumours, normofollicular- or macrofollicular-type tumours with low <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagenase activity showed few PCNA and EGFR positive cells and intact <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen of basement membranes, as seen in normal thyroids. Conversely, an atypical adenoma with higher <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagenase activity showed many PCNA and EGFR positive cells and weak <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> discontinuous immunostaining for <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen, as in thyroid carcinomas.

A reducing agent, dithiothreitol, was essential for the gelation of <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen in 2 M guanidine-HCl. An optimal concentration of guanidine-HCl for the gelation lays between 1. 5 and 2. 5 M: gelation did not occur at 1 M or lower and at 3 M or higher, although the circular dichroism spectrum characteristic of the collagenous triple-helix was not changed in 3 M guanidine-HCl.

The predominant metalloproteinases secreted were identified as latent <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> procollagenases having molecular masses of 72 kDa and 75 kDa, as detected in Western immunoblots with specific antibodies against <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> procollagenase. When peritubular cells were stimulated by dibutyryl cyclic AMP, forskolin or cholera toxin, they secreted increased amounts of <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> procollagenase. However, little if any of the active <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagenase, having a lower molecular mass of 66 kDa, could be detected under these conditions. Addition of low concentrations of cytochalasin D to peritubular cells in monoculture resulted in conversion of the latent <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagenase into its active form, assessed with antibody-specificity studies and by the appearance of the 66 kDa protein. In contrast, Sertoli cells in culture did not manifest an increased conversion of <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> procollagenase into <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagenase in the presence of cytochalasin D, even though cytochalasin D addition invariably resulted in a disruption of the microfilament assembly in each of these gonadal somatic cell populations. When peritubular cells were co-cultured with Sertoli cells, addition of cytochalasin D no longer resulted in formation of increased amounts of the active form of <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagenase. Sertoli cells and peritubular cells each secreted a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase type 2, detected with a specific antibody in a Western immunoblot to have a molecular mass of 21 kDa.

These studies show that keratinocytes hind directly to <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen and chemically define a major cell-adhesion -promoting site within the triple-helical region...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{basement}} membrane components (laminin, fibronectin and <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen) and lung fibroblasts on <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagenase and plasminogen activator activity {{was investigated in}} a primary HSV- 2 -induced hamster fibrosarcoma, and its in vivo derived sublines and in vitro derived clones of varying metastatic potential. Fibronectin and <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen were ineffective at influencing the expression of either <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagenase or plasminogen activator activity. Laminin, however, at concentrations of 1 - 10 micrograms ml- 1 added to the serum-free culture supernatants, increased the release of <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagenase by up to 100 % for the parental cell line. Three highly metastatic sublines (two from in vivo origin and one from in vitro cloning) showed increases of up to 300 %. Non-metastatic sublines (two from in vivo origin and one from in vitro cloning), however, showed no increase in <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagenase activity. Plasminogen activator release from either the parental line cell or its metastatic sublines and clones, was unaffected {{by the addition of}} laminin. Addition of tumour cells to lung fibroblast monolayers resulted in an increased expression of PA activity in the supernatant, whilst <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagenase activity was reduced...|$|R
40|$|<b>Type</b> <b>IV</b> {{collagen}} {{is a major}} {{basement membrane}} component that has been implicated in the regulation of angiogenesis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen an the angiogenic response of native endothelial cells in three-dimensional vascular organ culture. Rings of rat aorta were cultured under serum-free conditions in gels of type I collagen with or without <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen. In the absence of <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen, aortic rings generated neovessels, which proliferated until day 9 and gradually regressed during the second and third weeks of culture. <b>Type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen promoted neovessel elongation and survival in a dose-dependent manner. Microvascular length increased by 43, 57, and 119 % over control values in cultures treated with 3, 30, and 300 mu g/ml <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen, respectively. When used at high concentrations (300 mu g/ml) type TV collagen stabilized the neovascular outgrowths and prevented vascular regression. <b>Type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen also promoted the formation of neovessels, but significant stimulatory effects were observed only at an intermediate concentration (30 mu g/ml) and were no longer significant at the high concentration (300 mu g/ml). The observation that <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen has dose-dependent effects on vascular elongation, proliferation, and stabilization, supports the concept that the developing basement membrane of neovessels acts as a solid-phase regulator of angiogenesis, whose function varies depending on the concentration of its molecular components...|$|R
40|$|<b>Type</b> <b>IV</b> and V {{collagens}} were localized in neurofibromas {{from six}} patients with von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis (NF) using the peroxidase anti-peroxidase (PAP) technique. The collagens were also isolated from neurofibromas by pepsin digestion and fractionating salt precipitations and demonstrated with {{sodium dodecyl sulphate}} polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Staining reactions for both collagens were detected {{in most of the}} cells in the disorganized NF tumor tissue. These cells also were S- 100 protein-positive and were considered to be of Schwannian cell origin, while the <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen-negative cells showed fibroblastoid, mast cell and histiocytic characteristics. <b>Type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen detection was also used to study the structure of a neurofibroma after 3 weeks in tissue culture. The proportion of fibroblastoid, <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen-negative cells increased significantly in the cultured neurofibromas and "buds" containing solely fibroblastoid cells were seen at the periphery of the tumor fragments. Cultured 6 th passage tumor cells produced type V but no <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen as estimated with SDS-PAGE. Further, two malignant Schwannomas from a patient with NF were stained with antibodies to <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen. A positive staining reaction was associated only with the vascular walls in the malignant Schwannomas suggesting that <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen expression is linked with cell differentiation. The present data show that the detection of <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen using the PAP-method is useful in studying the organization of tumors with mixed cell populations such as neurofibromas. Large neurofibromas might also serve as a source for the isolation of human <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> and V collagens. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Type</b> <b>IV</b> {{collagen}} in Caenorhabditis elegans {{is produced}} by two essential genes, emb- 9 and let- 2, which encode Î± 1 - and Î± 2 -like chains, respectively. The distribution of EMB- 9 and LET- 2 chains has been characterized using chain-specific antisera. The chains colocalize, suggesting that they may function in a single heterotrimeric collagen molecule. <b>Type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen is detected in all basement membranes except those on the pseudocoelomic face of body wall muscle and on the regions of the hypodermis between body wall muscle quadrants, indicating that there are major structural differences between some basement membranes in C. elegans. Using lacZ/green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter constructs, both <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen genes were shown to be expressed in the same cells, primarily body wall muscles, and some somatic cells of the gonad. Although the pharynx and intestine are covered with basement membranes that contain <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen, these tissues do not express either <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen gene. Using an epitope-tagged emb- 9 construct, we show that <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen made in body wall muscle cells can assemble into the pharyngeal, intestinal, and gonadal basement membranes. Additionally, we show that expression of functional <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen only in body wall muscle cells is sufficient for C. elegans to complete development and be partially fertile. Since <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen secreted from muscle cells only assembles {{into some of the}} basement membranes that it has access to, there must be a mechanism regulating its assembly. We propose that interaction with a cell surfaceâ€“associated molecule(s) is required to facilitate <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen assembly...|$|R
40|$|Laminin and <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> {{collagen}} {{were compared}} for {{the ability to}} promote aortic endothelial cell adhesion and directed migration in vitro. Substratum-adsorbed IV promoted aortic endothelial cell adhesion in a concentration dependent fashion attaining a maximum level 141 -fold greater than controls within 30 min. Aortic endothelial cell adhesion to <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen was not inhibited by high levels (10 (- 3) M) of arginyl-glycyl-aspartyl-serine. In contrast, adhesion of aortic endothelial cells on laminin was slower, attaining only 53 % of the adhesion observed on <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen by 90 min. <b>Type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen when added to the lower well of a Boyden chamber stimulated the directional migration of aortic endothelial cells in a concentration dependent manner with a maximal response 6. 9 -fold over control levels, whereas aortic endothelial cells did not migrate in response to laminin at any concentration (. 01 - 2. 0 X 10 (- 7) M). Triple helix-rich fragments of <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen were nearly as active as intact <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen in stimulating both adhesion and migration whereas the carboxy terminal globular domain was less active at promoting adhesion (36 % of the adhesion promoted by intact <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen) or migration. Importantly, aortic endothelial cells also migrate to substratum adsorbed gradients of <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen suggesting that the mechanism of migration is haptotactic in nature. These results demonstrate that the aortic endothelial cell adhesion and migration is preferentially promoted by <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> collagen compared with laminin, and has a complex molecular basis which may be important in angiogenesis and large vessel repair...|$|R
40|$|An antigenically {{distinct}} serotype, <b>type</b> <b>IV,</b> {{has recently}} {{been added to the}} recognized serotypes of group B streptococci (GBS). We isolated and purified the capsular polysaccharide antigen from a prototype <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> GBS strain. The <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> capsular polysaccharide formed a precipitin line with rabbit antiserum to <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> GBS organisms but not with antiserum to organisms of GBS serotype Ia, Ib, II, or III. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay inhibition experiments showed no cross-reaction between <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> antiserum and other GBS serotypes. Capsular polysaccharide released from the bacterial cells with mutanolysin and that isolated from the culture supernatant had similar elution profiles on Sepharose CL- 6 B, with a Kav of 0. 30 and an estimated Mr of 200, 000. The purified <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> polysaccharide was found to contain galactose, glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) as exclusive sugars. The polysaccharide contained 23 % (by weight) sialic acid and galactose, glucose, and N-acetylglucosamine in a relative ratio of (1) : 1. 10 : 0. 55. These results are compatible with a repeating structure of six monosaccharide residues containing galactose, glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, and sialic acid in a molar ratio of 2 : 2 : 1 : 1. Unlike type Ia, II, and III GBS polysaccharides, desialylation of the <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> polysaccharide produced an antigen which formed a line of identity with the native <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> antigen in double diffusion in agar against homologous antiserum. This result suggests that sialic acid is not as critical to the immunodeterminant structure of the <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> antigen as it is for other GBS capsular types...|$|R
