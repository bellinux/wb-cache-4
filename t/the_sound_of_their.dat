While she is writing, an intruder enters the apartment. The intruder is Frank (Milo Quesada), who strangles Mary. <b>The</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> struggle awakens Rosy, and Frank realizes he murdered the wrong woman. Frank approaches Rosy's bed, but she seizes her knife and stabs Frank. Rosy drops the knife and breaks down in hysteria.|$|E
5|$|Machine Head {{increased}} {{the complexity and}} technicality in their sound for the next album, The Blackening, which partially changes <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> first 5 albums {{in favor of a}} more classic heavy metal and thrash metal oriented sound, with fully complex song structures and guitar riffs. Unto the Locust features heavier, faster and more complex riffs by both Robb Flynn and Phil Demmel, influenced by classical music, and supported by fast and complex drum patterns by Dave McClain. This is also the first Machine Head's record to include blast beats.|$|E
5|$|At home, Homer {{finds the}} {{personalized}} bowling glove given to Marge by Jacques and realizes {{he may be}} losing her. It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are proving to be true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, {{saying that it is}} all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to a fork in the road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know what to tell the boss. To <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> cheers, he says to say {{that they are going to}} the backseat of his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E

5|$|Invisible Circles is {{the third}} studio album by Dutch symphonic metal band After Forever. It was {{released}} on 25 March 2004, by the small Dutch label Transmission Records. It is After Forever's first full-length album since the dismissal of guitarist and composer Mark Jansen, whose musical tastes had strongly influenced <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> first work Prison of Desire (2000) and their successful second offering Decipher (2001). In this work After Forever choose a new musical direction, mostly revolving around elements of progressive metal instead of the gothic and symphonic metal of previous albums. The creative process for Invisible Circles {{took more than a}} year and required the use of three recording studios in the Netherlands and Germany. A long tour to support the album brought the band to some of the most important European rock festivals and to Central and South America.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, players can use a wide variety of weapons, {{including}} plastic bags, baseball bats, crowbars and a variety of bladed items. Later in the game, firearms become available (which cannot be used for executions). Should players take damage, their health depletes; health can be restored through the use of painkillers, which are available throughout each scene. Players also have a stamina meter which depletes as they sprint, but automatically replenishes when remaining stationary. Manhunt also makes use of the PlayStation 2's optional USB Microphone and the Xbox Live microphone feature on the Xbox in their respective versions of the game. When such a device is connected, players can use <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own voice to distract in-game enemies. This adds an extra element to the stealth aspect of the game, as players must refrain from making noises such as coughing as these sounds too can attract the attention of any nearby hunters.|$|E

25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, and <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first {{with a piece of}} oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E

500|$|U2 is {{credited}} with composing the music for all of Achtung Babys tracks, despite periods of separated songwriting. They wrote the music primarily through jam sessions, a common practice for them. The album represents a deviation from <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> past work; the songs are less anthemic in nature, and their musical style demonstrates a more European aesthetic, introducing influences from alternative rock, industrial music, and electronic dance music. The band referred to the album's musical departure as [...] "the sound of four men chopping down The Joshua Tree". Accordingly, the distorted introduction to the opening track [...] "Zoo Station" [...] was intended to make listeners think the record was broken or was mistakenly not the new U2 album. Author Susan Fast said that with the group's use of technology in the song's opening, [...] "there can be no mistake that U2 has embraced sound resources new to them".|$|E

Another 2002 live review, however, stated that [...] "the band seemed both at ease and happy to be back" [...] when playing one of their first post-Strange Bird concerts. dB magazines Steven Hocking, in a review of the band's 2004 Drones & Vapid Ditties live DVD, said the band are [...] "either unable or unwilling to engage the large audience", and that they were [...] "just not very visually engaging" [...] live, when compared to <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> albums. Performances post-Moo, You Bloody Choir have earned more positive remarks, however, as Richards has focused on improving his stage presence.

500|$|Having officially {{formed a}} band {{under the name}} Late of the Pier in 2004, {{childhood}} friends Sam Eastgate, Andrew Faley, Sam Potter, and the late Ross Dawson initially developed <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> first album by listening to the alternative dance music of British ensemble The Prodigy and the grunge music of American band Nirvana. They soon branched out into listening to diverse genres from the last 40 years of music, including Motown and soul. Potter has treated their conception of Fantasy Black Channel {{as a reaction to}} [...] "mediocre, complacent indie-schmindie bands who find a sound and stick to it; whose songs sound exactly the same", while lead writer and composer Eastgate has pointed out that they wanted to [...] "take people past their own limits". The nascent recording stages took place in Eastgate's bedroom, where unconventional time signatures and experimental chords were performed because, at the time, no band member could play an instrument properly.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there was}} {{increasing}} demand from fans, the band took their time with mixing and producing. Butler said {{the pressure was}} more rooted in giving the fans an album they deserve rather than meeting {{the expectations of the}} band. He said it was [...] "one of the hardest processes I've endured as a human being, not just as an artist, but ever." [...] Because Fake History was perceived by fans as sounding overproduced, the band strove for an [...] "organic and authentic" [...] sound that was [...] "very human" [...] and that reflected <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> live performances. They took [...] "an analogue route", where they used the test mix of the album as it [...] "spoke to them" [...] in its raw energy. After going through ten different sound engineers, they went with Stephen George, whom Sahyoun said [...] "just added little diamonds and made it pop", so the album sonically reminded them of their influences.|$|E
