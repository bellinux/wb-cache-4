5|$|In {{addition}} to the explanation by <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> they had been caught up {{in what is now}} called a time slip and had observed ghosts from the past, a non-supernatural explanation of the events was proposed by Philippe Jullian in his 1965 biography of the aristocratic decadent French poet Robert de Montesquiou. At the time of Moberly and Jourdain's excursion to Versailles, Montesquiou lived nearby and reportedly gave parties in the grounds where his friends dressed in period costume and performed tableaux vivants as part of the party entertainments. Moberly and Jourdain may have inadvertently gatecrashed a gay fancy dress party. The Marie-Antoinette figure could have been a society lady or a cross-dresser, the pockmarked man Montesquiou himself. It was suggested that a gathering of the French decadent avant-garde of the time could have made a sinister impression on the two middle-class Edwardian spinsters who would have been little used to such company.|$|E
5|$|This artistic {{period is}} one of {{discovery}} of the expressive possibilities of the human body; {{there is a greater}} freedom in the poses and gestures, and an increased attention to anatomical verisimilitude, as may be observed in the ponderated stances of figures W9 and W4, who partially anticipate the Doryphoros of Polykleitos. There is a noticeable ease to the physiques of the frieze compared with the stiffness of the metopes along with an eye for such subtleties as knuckle joints, veins, and the careful articulation of musculature. One important innovation of the style is the use of drapery as an expression of motion, or to suggest the body beneath; in archaic and early classical sculpture, clothing fell over the body {{as if it were a}} curtain obscuring the form below, in theses sculptures there is the billowing chlamydes of the horsemen and the multi-pleated peploi of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> lends a surface movement and tension to their otherwise, static poses. Variation in the manes of the horses has been of particular interest to some scholars attempting to discern the artistic personalities of sculptors who laboured on the frieze or perhaps, indicating deliberate representation of different regional traditions, so far this Morellian analysis has been without conclusion.|$|E

She contacted all participating artists, and recalled: We already had our soundtrack, and I already had Martha Wainwright singing [...] "No Woman, No Cry," [...] which was great, but it got us all thinking that a compilation CD would be a great way to target women who are artists and also mothers and see what they're willing to contribute.

Quagmire is beaten up then arrested, but released shortly after by Joe. On his return, Lois, Bonnie and Loretta reveal that they're petitioning the city of Quahog to have Quagmire removed from their neighborhood. As Peter and the other guys are defending Quagmire, Ernie the Giant Chicken attacks Peter and starts a fight that causes huge casualties inside and outside of Quahog.

Discovering that a lady in a fitting room is having a heart attack, he appears to rush to her aid, performing CPR and saving her life. Quagmire is congratulated for his heroism, but his intention had been to molest the woman while she was unconscious (which he reveals by asking [...] "What the hell is CPR?").|$|E
500|$|A Girl in Every Port is {{considered}} by film scholars {{to be the most}} important film of Hawks's silent career. It is the first of his films to utilize many of the Hawksian themes and characters that would define much of his subsequent work. It was his first [...] "love story between two men," [...] with two men bonding over their duty, skills and careers, who consider their friendship to be more important than their relationships with women. Hawks wrote the original story and developed the screenplay with James Kevin McGuinness and Seton Miller. In the film Victor McLaglen and Robert Armstrong play two merchant seamen who are archrivals when it comes to women, with McLaglen constantly finding Armstrong's tattoo on <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> he is attempting to seduce. Eventually the two rivals become friends. Louise Brooks plays the cabaret singer with whom the two men fall in love. The film was shot from October to December 1927 and released in February 1928. It was successful in the US, and a hit in Europe where Louise Brooks was developing a cult following. In France, Henri Langlois called Hawks [...] "the Gropius of the cinema" [...] and Swiss novelist and poet Blaise Cendrars said that the film [...] "definitely marked the first appearance of contemporary cinema." [...] Hawks went over budget once again with this film, though, and his relationship with Sol Wurtzel deteriorated. After an advance screening that received positive reviews, Wurtzel told Hawks, [...] "This is the worst picture Fox has made in years." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2004 it was {{announced}} that Leslie Grantham had not renewed his contract and that Den Watts would depart EastEnders in what was described by The Mirror as an [...] "explosive" [...] and final exit. The storyline became one of [...] "the program's biggest and most high-profile narratives", dominating the entire year, and made the character of Chrissie Watts the [...] "centrepiece" [...] of the show. The lead-up to the 20th anniversary episode in February was an immensely high-profile affair, with Imogen Ridgway and Richard Godwin of the Evening Standard dryly observing that [...] "unless you've been living on Titan you probably know that EastEnders is 20 years old and Dirty Den is once again leaving Albert Square." [...] Events in the show centre around Chrissie manipulating Sam Mitchell and Zoe Slater in a plot of revenge against Den, the three women being dubbed the [...] "Witches of Walford" [...] by the popular press in reference to Shakespeare's play, Macbeth. The prelude to Den's death further highlighted and showcased Chrissie's manipulative character and conniving personality in her representation as a [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "forceful" [...] figure. When she secretly learns that Zoe is pregnant by Den, she plays on Zoe's insecurities and vulnerabilities and [...] "coerces" [...] her into having an abortion. The pregnancy represented a double blow to Chrissie as Den had always resisted having children with her, and as with Kate Mitchell, Chrissie determines to teach Zoe a harsh lesson about [...] "messing with other people's husbands". The possessive nature of his wife was noted by Den, who warns Zoe that Chrissie [...] "tends to blame <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> lead me astray." ...|$|E

500|$|From 1904 onwards, Bondfield was {{increasingly}} occupied {{with the issue}} of women's suffrage. In that year she travelled with Dora Montefiore of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) to the International Congress of Women in Berlin, but she was not in sympathy with the main WSPU policy, which was to secure the vote for women on the same highly restricted basis that it was then given to men. This involved a property qualification, and thus largely excluded the working class. Bondfield saw no benefit in this policy to <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> she represented, and aligned herself with the Adult Suffrage Society (ASS), which campaigned for universal adult suffrage, men and women alike, regardless of property. In 1906 she became chairman of the society and supported the Franchise and Removal of Women's Disabilities bill, introduced to parliament by Sir Charles Dilke. This proposed full adult suffrage, and the right of women to become MPs. The bill was [...] "talked out" [...] in the House of Commons, but Bondfield's support antagonised many militants in the WSPU, who considered the bill a distraction from their more limited aims. In 1907, {{in the course of a}} public debate with Teresa Billington-Greig of the Women's Freedom League (a breakaway group from the WSPU), Bondfield argued that the only way forward was a bill that enfranchised all men and all women, without qualification. She wished good luck to those fighting for a [...] "same terms as men" [...] suffrage bill, but [...] "don't let them come and tell me that they are working for my class". The strains of her duties and constant campaigning began to undermine her health, and in 1908 she resigned her union post after ten years' service, during which NAUSAWC membership had risen to over 20,000. Her departure, she said, was [...] "alike a grief and a deliverance".|$|E
500|$|Alberta's women, {{especially}} those of the UFA-affiliated United Farm Women of Alberta, were active in the province's moral reform movement. [...] They were also active in seeking the vote: in 1913 a delegation of them arrived at the legislature demanding the vote; Sifton asked them [...] "did you ladies wash up your luncheon dishes before you came down here to ask me for the vote? [...] If you haven't you'd better go home because you're {{not going to get}} any votes from me." [...] In October 1914 another delegation arrived, bearing the signatures of 40,000 people. [...] At that time, the Premier agreed that most traditional objections to extension of the franchise were [...] "played out", but expressed concern at the increases that would result to the cost of elections and uncertainty at whether most of the province's women actually wanted suffrage. [...] In February 1915 a larger delegation arrived at the legislature and occupied the MLAs' seats, demanding that the franchise be extended quickly enough to allow women to vote in the upcoming prohibition referendum; an angry Sifton refused and suggested to <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> if they wanted the vote, they should contact their MLAs and promise that they would use their votes to re-elect them, [...] "which is after all one of the strongest way in which you can appeal to male human nature, as represented in the legislature." [...] Even so, he committed to raising the issue in the legislature after the referendum. [...] On September 17, 1915, he told UFA President James Speakman that he had given instructions for the preparation of a statute [...] "placing men and women in Alberta on the basis of absolute equality so far as Provincial matters are concerned." [...] True to his word, he introduced legislation in the spring of 1916 giving women the vote in all provincial and municipal elections. [...] The Conservatives supported it enthusiastically, and only St. Albert MLA Lucien Boudreau voted against it (though Ribstone Liberal James Gray Turgeon admitted that he was supporting his leader's legislation against his own convictions).|$|E
