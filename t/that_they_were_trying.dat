Police {{reinforcements}} arrived, as did the news media, and word spread throughout the neighborhood {{that the police had}} committed some outrage in the mosque <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to cover up. An angry and restless crowd had gathered as the police secured the inside of the mosque and tried to figure out what had happened. Two men were arrested and the other worshippers were in custody. Seedman was planning to interrogate them when he showed up.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, October 4 Achille Lauro {{called in}} Naples then sailed through the Straits of Messina the Mediterranean was calm {{and the fall}} day was warm. Cruise manager Max Fico would later recall that he noticed that several young men were acting suspicious, in that they kept to {{themselves}} refusing any of the congenial friendliness common to the other cruise guests. They claimed to be Argentinean when other guests tried to engage them in English, but didn't understand fluent Spanish when it was spoken to them. They had passports from Portugal, Norway, and Argentina – later it was theorized <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to maintain a cover story.|$|E
25|$|However, unnamed U.S. {{officials}} {{continued to}} deny that the shooting down of the satellite {{was in response to}} China’s ASAT test one year prior, or <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to protect classified satellite technology. U.S. Officials pointed out that the U.S. had no reason to prove that it could shoot down a satellite, as the U.S. had already publicly done so in the 1980s. Another key difference pointed out by General Cartwright was that this intercept happened at a much lower altitude, whereas China’s ASAT weapon destroyed a target at a much higher altitude, which resulting in the creation of debris which continues to pose a potential hazard to other spacecraft. Finally, U.S. officials again affirmed that the mission’s intent was to preserve human life.|$|E

25|$|Butler and Stringham left {{immediately}} after the battle, the former to Washington and the latter accompanying the prisoners to New York. Critics argued that each was trying to gather credit for the victory to himself. The pair contended, however, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to persuade the administration to abandon the original plan to block up Hatteras Inlet. In Federal hands {{it was no longer}} useful to the Confederacy, and in fact now allowed Union forces to pursue raiders into the sounds. Although they and their supporters continued to press the case for several weeks, it seems to have been unnecessary. The War and Navy Departments had already decided to retain possession of the inlet, which would be used as the entry point of an amphibious expedition against the North Carolina mainland early the next year. This campaign, known as Burnside's North Carolina Expedition for its senior Army commander Ambrose E. Burnside, completely removed the sounds as sources of commerce-raiding activity.|$|E
25|$|The Hellfire Club {{was then}} {{able to claim}} Jean {{as one of their}} members. By using the {{combined}} telepathic powers of both Emma and the Stepford Cuckoos, they mentally tricked Jean into doing what they wanted by using images of Scott and Professor X. But the mental contact was interrupted by Scott's unusually strong physic/telepathic connection to Jean. The Stepford Cuckoos then tried to release the Phoenix Force so they could be hosts, and seemingly succeeded. Emma was shocked when she learned the true purpose was for the Inner Circle to control the vastly limitless power and energy of the Phoenix when she originally thought <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to release the Phoenix back into space to prevent the world from destruction. Jean and Cyclops then left to fight the Phoenix, but not before Jean angrily pinned Emma to the wall and telekinetically bound Emma with iron pipes after seeing Emma passionately kiss Cyclops (leading her to suspect that Emma may have plotted to steal Cyclops from her). Jean was unable to subdue the Phoenix herself, prompting Cyclops to attack the cosmic entity, only to be struck down as Jean watched in horror. Before the Phoenix could kill Cyclops, Emma, freed by Wolverine, arrived and took the Phoenix Force into herself, seemingly dying in the process by shattering into several diamond fragments. Jean has rejoined the X-Men and her memories have since returned and appeared to have reconciled with Cyclops.|$|E
25|$|Their {{preliminary}} versions used primitive art {{assets to}} allow them to focus on the game. This helped them to realize <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to help the player become invested in the characters they controlled, allowing their imagination to fill in what their graphics at the time could not. Only as they neared the August 2011 Game Developers Conference in China after about six months of work, where they planned to submit FTL as part of the Independent Games Festival there, did they start focusing on the game's art. The game was named as a finalist at the IGF China competition, leading to initial media exposure for the game. PC Gamer magazine offered an early preview of the game that created more media interest in time for the Independent Games Festival at the March 2012 Games Developer Conference. The OnLive cloud-based gaming service included FTL and other Independent Games Festival finalists for several weeks around the conference. At the Festival, FTL was nominated for, though did not win, the Grand Prize and the Excellent in Design award; these accolades further helped spark interest in the game. Davis considered that the game's involvement in these competitions were important to keep the game's development on a forward schedule, as judges and members of the press would be expecting playable prototypes of the completed title. He believed that the publicity of being a part of these competitions, even if not as a nominated title, helped to garner interest in FTL by the larger public.|$|E

The sole lyrics to the song were the numbers of the digital code itself: [...] "09 F9 11 02 9D 74 E3 5B D8 41 56 C5 63 56 88 C0". [...] "I {{thought it was a}} source of comedy <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> so futilely to quell the spread of this number," [...] Burgun said.

500|$|In [...] "Mass Effect 2: Overlord", elite human soldier Commander Shepard is sent on {{a mission}} to {{investigate}} a Cerberus research base that has gone silent. The base is located on the surface of an Earth-like planet called Aite. Upon arriving at the facility, Shepard is informed that an experimental virtual intelligence has gone rogue and is ordered to destroy an antenna inside a transmission dish before the virtual intelligence uploads a program off-planet. Shepard successfully destroys the antenna and is then met by Dr. Gavin Archer, the scientist that is responsible for the situation. Archer explains <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to gain influence over a hostile race of networked artificial intelligences called the geth by interfacing a human mind with a virtual intelligence. In the process, the virtual intelligence overpowered the test subject's mind, Archer's brother David, and has evolved into a virus.|$|E

It was only afterwards that much more information came out." [...] Police said that Saari would have been detained if they had known about this video at the time of the questioning. Police said that they believed Saari's videos were shot by someone else, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to identify who this person was. The Chief Investigator of the case, Jari Neulaniemi, speculated that the cameraman may have been the friend of Saari's who was murdered.|$|E
500|$|Namuth {{found that}} the rapport he {{developed}} with his subjects was integral to making them feel comfortable being photographed while working. [...] While Namuth {{was known to be}} a technically skilled photographer, his sociable and outgoing personality contributed largely to his notability in the New York art scene. [...] Namuth was also persistent when persuading his subjects to agree to be photographed, including sculptor Joseph Cornell, who took two years to be convinced. [...] He generally managed to put his subject at ease well enough so that they could work naturally in their environments without any artificial stiffness. [...] Largely because of this, self-conscious artists such as Clyfford Still and Saul Steinberg agreed to be subjects for Namuth's photography. [...] However, critic Sarah Boxer suggests {{that it is difficult to}} view photos of such artists without considering the possibility <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to gain fame in a manner similar to Pollock. [...] Though Namuth developed personal relationships with many of his subjects, art critic Hilton Kramer describes Namuth as [...] "something of a hero worshiper." ...|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{went to the}} Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and U.S. Customs {{early on}} with the script and told them <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to present as {{detailed}} and accurate {{a picture of the}} current drug war as possible. The DEA and Customs pointed out inaccuracies in the script. In addition, they gave the production team access to the border checkpoint to Mexico, as shown in the film during the scene in which Wakefield and his people talk with border officials. Despite the assistance, the DEA did not try to influence the content of the script. Soderbergh said Traffic had influences from the films of Richard Lester and Jean-Luc Godard. He also spent time analyzing The Battle of Algiers and Z, which, according to the director, had the feeling that the footage was [...] "caught" [...] and not staged. Another inspiration was Alan J. Pakula's film All the President's Men because of its ability to tackle serious issues while being entertaining. In the opening credits of his film, Soderbergh tried to replicate the typeface from All the President's Men and the placement on-screen at the bottom left-hand corner. Analyzing this film helped the director deal with the large cast and working in many different locations for Traffic.|$|E

500|$|On April 14, Thomas {{announced}} that he was leaving the series to focus on his two pilots for ABC. Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah were hired as the new executive producer and wrote {{a new version of the}} script in late April. Sachs said that although Thomas had a [...] "great script", their version of the script was [...] "edgier". Judah said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to ground their script in reality, with real character stories and emotional stories. The writers wanted the audience to relate to the characters' problems, which they wanted to be truthful and emotional, but also comedic. The pair were interested in telling several stories simultaneously, featuring many characters. The pair changed the surname of the family from Mills to Wilson, and told reporters that they would be adding their [...] "comedic impulses" [...] to the script. Sachs and Judah found the parents to be an integral part of the series, and designed them to be contemporary parents. Since the producers were both fathers, they designed the script to include more prominent adult story lines and a strong point of view on parenting. Judah was interested in focusing on how the family kept their moral center when moving to Beverly Hills, and the way the parents dealt with their teenagers.|$|E
500|$|Furlan {{is said to}} {{have asked}} for her {{character}} to be written out of the series because {{she did not want to}} travel to Hawaii to film her scenes, although she later called this an untrue rumor. [...] The producers decided for Rousseau to be shot, with the possibility of her returning in season five. [...] Co-show runners and executive producers Damon Lindelof and Cuse originally intended for Rousseau to get her own flashback episode in season four, however as a result of the Writer's Strike, this did not come to pass. When asked whether Rousseau would have a flashback in season five, Lindelof said that Rousseau's story would [...] "definitively" [...] be revealed, but that [...] "to use the word flashback would be disingenuous". Cuse revealed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to steer away from the word flashback and were [...] "embracing a whole new word". He explained that [...] "there will still [...] be flashbacks and flash-forwards on the show, but we're going to do something different this year. We're going to mix it up." [...] Instead of using flashbacks and flashforwards like in previous seasons, stories of the fifth season will play out both on and off the island stories in different points in time. The writers were supposedly scheduling an appearance by Furlan for the fifth season, but Furlan did not end up making an appearance. [...] However, she returns in the form of Rousseau's [...] "sideways" [...] counterpart (who never crashed on the Island, lost Alex or went insane) in the sixth season.|$|E
