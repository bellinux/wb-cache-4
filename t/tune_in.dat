5|$|The final {{piece of}} the set, in A major, is a serene andante, with a flowing <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> the Mendelssohnian style. After gentle variation, it equally gently fades to silence at the end.|$|E
5|$|The hymn <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> E minor {{follows the}} {{structure}} of the bar form. It culminates in the long phrase of line 8 and repeats line 1 in line 9, framing the stanza.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Vargas Llosa's works have been adapted for the screen, {{including}} The Time of the Hero and Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (both by the Peruvian director Francisco Lombardi) and The Feast of the Goat (by Vargas Llosa's cousin, Luis Llosa). Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter {{was turned into}} the English-language film, <b>Tune</b> <b>in</b> Tomorrow. The Feast of the Goat has also been adapted as a theatrical play by Jorge Alí Triana, a Colombian playwright and director.|$|E
5000|$|The Fiddler's Fakebook, by David Brody, is a {{collection}} of fiddle <b>tunes</b> <b>in</b> lead sheet form (naturally without lyrics.) It includes <b>tunes</b> <b>in</b> the following styles: ...|$|R
50|$|Mersenne {{indicates}} in {{his book}} {{that there were many}} ways to tune a mandore, but three ways predominated: <b>tuning</b> <b>in</b> unison, <b>tuning</b> with a lowered string, and <b>tuning</b> <b>in</b> a third.|$|R
50|$|The two lowest {{courses are}} <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> octaves. The three higher ones are <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> unison. However, the 2nd highest {{course is a}} single string instead of a pair like the rest.|$|R
5|$|At the Leipzig {{performances}} of the cantata, the first verse of the chorale was probably sung by a soprano, instead of using an instrumental rendition of the chorale <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> the first aria. The cantata was transposed from C major to E-flat major at Leipzig, where the recorders may {{have been replaced by}} transverse flutes.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata, {{the seventh}} {{work in his}} chorale cantata cycle, in seven movements: two framing choral movements, a recitative and an unusual sequence of four bipartite arias. He scored the work for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir, and a Baroque chamber ensemble of a horn to reinforce the hymn <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> the outer movements, two transverse flutes, two oboes d'amore, strings and continuo. It is the only known work from his chorale cantata cycle that kept the original words unchanged.|$|E
5|$|Common Sense Media gave {{it three}} stars {{out of five}} and, while not commenting further on its quality, stated that it was {{appropriate}} for grade-school children but that some violent scenes were inadvisable for younger viewers. A second Famitsu review from later in 2003 called the anime an outstanding success and encouraged readers to <b>tune</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
50|$|The outing saw a {{decrease}} {{from the previous}} episode, tied for second in its time period with a 2.2/6 among 18-49s with only 7.39 million viewers <b>tuning</b> <b>in</b> (placing it fifth among the number of viewers <b>tuning</b> <b>in).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{series was}} well {{received}} {{with an estimated}} 3.9 million viewers Malaysia-wide <b>tuning</b> <b>in</b> each week. TV3 estimated 5 million viewers <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> to watch the final episode. The series was internationally known by Malaysians around the world.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{the other}} coursed {{multi-string}} guitars, the Glissentar is strung with nylon strings. The eleven strings are in six courses. The first five strings are double, <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> unison and the 11th string is just one, <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> E.|$|R
5|$|Shortwave {{listening}} also remains {{popular with}} some expatriates who <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> shortwave transmissions from their homeland. Additionally, {{a number of}} remotely controlled shortwave receivers located {{around the world are}} available to users on the web. While radio hobbyists report that the number of shortwave listening clubs has diminished and printed magazines devoted to the hobby are few, enthusiasts such as Glenn Hauser and others continue to populate web sites, and originate podcasts dedicated to the pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata {{in seven}} movements, {{beginning with a}} chorale fantasia and ending in a closing chorale, as usually in his chorale cantatas, but with an unusual sequence of only one recitative and four arias, setting the poetic hymn stanzas. He scored it for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T) and bass) (B), a four-part choir, and a Baroque chamber ensemble of corno da caccia (Co) to support the chorale <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> the outer movements, two flauti traversi (Ft), two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), two violas (Va) and basso continuo (Bc).|$|E
5|$|Kiplagat, who {{was ever}} {{present at the}} front of the women's race, outdid Ethiopian Dire <b>Tune</b> <b>in</b> the last {{kilometre}} to win her second gold medal on the global stage. Mirroring Kitwara, Kenya's women's bronze medallist Peninah Jerop Arusei secured the team's victory over Ethiopia. Representing the hosts, Zhu Xiaolin was the only non-African to reach the top eight at the championships. The joint effort of the Japanese women aided them to a sixth consecutive team bronze medal – making them the only medalling country outside the typically strong African triumvirate of Kenya, Ethiopia and Eritrea.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} tunings are used. Usually, courses of 2 adjacent strings are <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> unison. By far the most common tuning {{is the same as}} violin <b>tuning,</b> <b>in</b> scientific pitch notation G3–D4–A4–E5, or in Helmholtz pitch notation: g–d′–a′–e″.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Recently the DiracNMSSM {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a possible solution to reduce the fine <b>tuning</b> <b>in</b> supersymmetry. We determine the degree of fine <b>tuning</b> needed <b>in</b> the DiracNMSSM with and without non-universal gaugino masses and compare it with the fine <b>tuning</b> <b>in</b> the GNMSSM. To apply reasonable cuts on the allowed parameter regions we perform a precise calculation of the Higgs mass. In addition, we include the limits from direct SUSY searches and dark matter abundance. We find that both models are comparable in terms of fine tuning, with the minimal fine <b>tuning</b> <b>in</b> the GNMSSM slightly smaller. ar X i...|$|R

5|$|The tournament attracts {{television}} audiences beyond South America, Mexico and Spain. Matches are {{broadcast in}} over 135 countries, with commentary {{in more than}} 30 languages, and thus the Copa is often considered {{as one of the}} most watched sports events on TV; Fox Sports en Latinoamérica, for example, reaches more than 25 million households in the Americas. The 2009 edition saw over 1 billion television spectators in total <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> for the competition. Torneos y Competencias is a secondary sponsor that sponsors the television broadcasts of the Copa Libertadores. Setanta Sports Australia broadcasts live Copa Libertadores matches in Australia.|$|E
5|$|American trumpeter Chet Baker {{recorded}} the <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> 1987 for the documentary Let's Get Lost (1989) {{and it was}} released on the soundtrack album. He also covered it in concert on June 14, 1987, in Tokyo, creating an extended version totaling seven minutes and fifty-three seconds. After his death in 1988, it was released on his posthumous album Chet Baker in Tokyo (1988). At a 1998 benefit concert for the Walden Woods Project in Concord, Massachusetts, ska musician Gwen Stefani sang it alongside a jazz orchestra. It was later included on the accompanying promotional CD for AT customers, titled Stormy Weather (1998). Other renditions were made by Kate Dimbleby and Jimmy Scott for their 1998 albums, Good Vibrations and Holding Back the Years, respectively. The Reputation featured it on their eponymous debut album in 2002, followed with covers performed by Everything but the Girl and Alison Moyet in 2003 and 2004, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Vargas Llosa {{was elected}} {{as a member}} of the Peruvian Academy of Language, a {{membership}} he still holds today. That year, he also published Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (La tía Julia y el escribidor), based in part on his marriage to his first wife, Julia Urquidi, to whom he dedicated the novel. She later wrote a memoir, Lo que Varguitas no dijo (What Little Vargas Didn't Say), in which she gives her personal account of their relationship. She states that Vargas Llosa's account exaggerates many negative points in their courtship and marriage while minimizing her role of assisting his literary career. Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter is considered one of the most striking examples of how the language and imagery of popular culture can be used in literature. The novel was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, <b>Tune</b> <b>in</b> Tomorrow.|$|E

5|$|MAGIC, JAL's {{in-flight}} entertainment system, {{supported by}} the JAL Entertainment Network (now renamed as JAL Mooove!), features the latest hit movies and videos, games and audio programs. There are six generations of the MAGIC system: MAGIC-I, MAGIC-II, MAGIC-III, MAGIC-IV, MAGIC-V and the new MAGIC-VI". Introduced on 1 December 2007, the MAGIC-III system provides Audio/Video On Demand (AVOD) entertainment to all passengers. The number of movie, music, video and game channels on MAGIC-III was doubled from 57 to 130 by 2008; and it is installed on all seats on Boeing 767-300ER, 777-200ER and 777-300ER aircraft. Aircraft with MAGIC-I and MAGIC-II have movies that automatically start when the AVOD system is turned on—once the aircraft reaches cruise level—and economy class passengers can <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> to watch the movie in progress; and all movies restart upon completion. Executive and First Class passengers have full AVOD control. MAGIC systems also have JAL's duty-free shopping catalogue, including flight crew recommendations and a video of specials available on the flight. MAGIC-V will feature mostly the same entertainment as MAGIC-III, but with a touch screen controller, along with a handset. There will be USB ports for iPod connectivity, and an easier to control handset. (introduced on selected Boeing 767-300ER routes).|$|E
5|$|Miller's only solo album, a 2000 concert {{recording}} entitled Solo, {{was released}} in 2010 and was well received by critics for the imagination and harmonic development in Miller's playing. Also in 2010, Miller joined guitarist John Scofield's new band. That year, Miller had a minor stroke. After this, he took medicine, changed his diet and lost weight; he also reduced his touring and recording. In February 2012 he traveled to Denmark to play with Klüvers Big Band; selections {{from one of the}} five concerts were released under Miller's co-leadership as Grew's <b>Tune.</b> <b>In</b> autumn 2012 he performed as a piano duo with Kenny Barron, continuing an association that had begun some years earlier. In the winter of that year he toured Europe as part of a quintet led by reeds players Yusef Lateef and Archie Shepp.|$|E
5|$|Instead of an orchestral tutti, the concerto {{opens with}} the almost {{immediate}} entry of the solo violin, playing the very <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> E minor that gave Mendelssohn no peace. Following a bravura of rapidly ascending notes, the opening theme is then restated by the orchestra. There is then a frenetic chromatic transition passage {{as the music}} subsides and modulates into a tranquil second subject theme in G major. The melody is initially played by the woodwinds with the soloist providing a pedal note on an open G string. The tune is played by the solo violin itself before a short codetta ends the exposition section of the opening movement. The opening two themes are then combined in the development section, where the music builds up to the innovative cadenza, which Mendelssohn wrote out in full rather than allowing the soloist to improvise. The cadenza builds up speed through rhythmic shifts from quavers to quaver-triplets and finally to semiquavers, which require ricochet bowing from the soloist. This serves as {{a link to the}} recapitulation, where the opening melody is played by the orchestra, accompanied by the continuing ricochet arpeggios by the soloist. During the recapitulation, the opening themes are repeated with the second theme being played in the E major before returning to E minor for the closing of the movement. The music gathers speed into the coda, which is marked 'Presto', before a variant of the original chromatic transition passage ends the first movement.|$|E

50|$|Seeking {{a guitar}} tuning that would {{facilitate}} jazz improvisation, Ralph Patt invented major-thirds <b>tuning</b> <b>in</b> 1963. Patt's <b>tuning</b> {{is a regular}} <b>tuning,</b> <b>in</b> the sense {{that all of the}} intervals between its successive open strings are major thirds; in contrast, standard guitar tuning has one major-third amid four fourths.|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{members of}} the violin family, which are <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> fifths, viols are usually <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> fourths with a major third in the middle, {{mirroring}} the tuning employed on the vihuela de mano and lute during the 16th century and {{similar to that of}} the modern six-string guitar.|$|R
