5|$|Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR): Multiple rocket {{launches}} (up to 15 in some plans) {{would carry}} {{parts of a}} Direct Ascent spacecraft and propulsion units for translunar injection (TLI). <b>These</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> assembled into a single spacecraft in Earth orbit.|$|E
5|$|Eight 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes {{were to be}} carried. Four of <b>these</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> mounted {{inside the}} hull below the {{waterline}}, two at {{either side of the}} bow; the others would be above the waterline at the stern, two at either side.|$|E

5|$|In 1462, the {{exchequer}} {{was told}} to no longer summon for audit any farms or feefarms worth over 40 shillings per year, as <b>these</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> supervised by a newly appointed board of receivers or approvers.|$|E
5|$|Konnan {{made two}} final {{appearances}} for World Wrestling All-Stars in May 2003, before the promotion folded. He also wrestled a tag match teamed with Norman Smiley for MXPW in September 2003. <b>These</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> his last extended stints {{in the independent}} circuit for nearly a decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} in North America on February 8, 2011. Jellyvision Games has stated they considered further international releases, but <b>these</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> too expensive at the present time. The company does not rule out future iterations of the game being released to a wider market based {{on the success of}} this title.|$|E
50|$|On 3 December, the Interior Minister Petteri Orpo {{announced}} that special repatriation centers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> established. <b>These</b> centers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> inhabited by the asylum seekers whose applications were declined. While he stressed that <b>these</b> camps <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> prisons, {{he described the}} inhabitants <b>would</b> <b>be</b> under strict surveillance.|$|R

5|$|There {{are also}} {{a number of small}} items of {{uncertain}} function, described as toiletry pieces. Some are picks, others perhaps scrapers, and three have empty sockets at one end, which probably contained organic material such as bristle, to make a brush. The size of <b>these</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> appropriate for cleaning the teeth or applying cosmetics, among other possibilities.|$|E
5|$|A typical Nike-X {{deployment}} {{around a}} major city would have consisted of several missile batteries. One of <b>these</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> equipped with the MAR and its associated DCDP computers, while the others would optionally have an MSR. The sites were all networked together using communications equipment working at normal voice bandwidths. Some of the smaller bases would be built north of the MAR to provide protection to this central station.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Night Interception Committee on 2 May it was decided that the bomber threat was greater than submarines, and the {{decision}} was made to move 80 of the 140 ASV Mk. I transmitters to AI, adding to 70 being constructed by EKCO (E.K. Cole). <b>These</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> turned into 60 IIIA's and 40 IIIB's. At a further meeting on 23 May, Tizard, perhaps prompted by comments from Director of Signals (Air), suggested that the units were not suitable for operational use, especially due to low reliability, and should be confined to daylight training missions.|$|E

5|$|Estimating {{the exact}} {{rate at which}} GRBs occur is difficult; for a galaxy of {{approximately}} {{the same size as}} the Milky Way, estimates of the expected rate (for long-duration GRBs) can range from one burst every 10,000 years, to one burst every 1,000,000 years. Only a small percentage of <b>these</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.|$|E
5|$|Fewer colours of coat {{appear in}} the Pembroke breed. These include red, sable, tan, fawn and black, each {{of which can be}} with or without white markings. Plain white or grey coats can also be seen, but <b>these</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{considered}} to be a serious fault for the purposes of conformation shows. However, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi has no specific disqualification criteria present in the breed standard.|$|E
5|$|From 4 December 1956 to 26 February 1957, Takechi {{served as}} {{the host of the}} Nippon Television program, The Tetsuji Takechi Hour. The show {{featured}} the Takechi Kabuki's interpretations of such Japanese stage classics as Chūshingura, and was also known for pushing the limits of the coverage of sexual subjects on television for its time. Takechi directed two more kabuki performances for the Nissei Theater in Tokyo, not long after it was opened in 1963. Though <b>these</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> his last kabuki productions, Takechi's influence on the art form continued to be felt for decades after his departure for the cinema.|$|E

5|$|On 25August, Pentland {{attacked}} and destroyed two German planes, a DFW two-seater and Fokker D.VII, before himself being shot down and {{wounded in the}} foot. <b>These</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> his last victories; his grand total of twenty-three included eleven destroyed, {{one of which was}} shared, and twelve out of control, three of them shared. This score ranked him fifth among the Australian aces of the war after Robert Little, Stan Dallas, Harry Cobby and Roy King.|$|E
5|$|Some protein {{complexes}} {{contain a}} large central cavity that is {{isolated from the}} remainder of the cytosol. One example of such an enclosed compartment is the proteasome. Here, a set of subunits form a hollow barrel containing proteases that degrade cytosolic proteins. Since <b>these</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> damaging if they mixed freely with {{the remainder of the}} cytosol, the barrel is capped by a set of regulatory proteins that recognize proteins with a signal directing them for degradation (a ubiquitin tag) and feed them into the proteolytic cavity.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Commission {{reported}} in August 1913. It {{recommended that the}} Koninklijke Marine (Royal Netherlands Navy) acquire nine dreadnought-type battleships to protect the NEI from attack and help guarantee the country's neutrality in Europe. Five of <b>these</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> based in the colony, while the other four would operate out of the Netherlands. Seven foreign companies submitted designs for the contract; naval historians believe that a 26,850-long-ton (27,280tonnes) ship, whose design was submitted by the German firm Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft, would have been eventually selected.|$|E
50|$|It {{is thought}} that there were eight or {{possibly}} nine mills on the River Lea in Stratford {{at the time of}} the Domesday Book (though this number may refer to the number of pairs of millstones rather than buildings). <b>These</b> <b>would</b> <b>are</b> the earliest recorded examples of a tidal mill system.|$|R

5|$|The first away {{game for}} the Ramblin' Wreck was the 1961 game against the Alabama Crimson Tide. The Wreck was freighted by Southern Railway to Birmingham, Alabama. At the time, Alabama played its home games at Legion Field. Before the game the current driver Dekle Rountree decided to {{traverse}} the slope up to visit Birmingham's Vulcan statue. The trip to Birmingham was such a success, a trip to Jacksonville for Tech's Gator Bowl appearance against Penn State was organized as well. <b>These</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the first road and bowl game appearances for the Wreck in its illustrious career.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} pilots {{licensed}} by the CAA to fly powered aircraft in 2005 was 47,000, of whom 28,000 held a Private Pilot Licence. The remainder held professional pilot licences, either a Commercial Pilot Licence or an Airline Transport Pilot Licence, although not all of <b>these</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> engaged in GA activities. In addition, there are 10,000 active glider pilots, and estimates put the membership of aviation-related sport and recreational associations at 36,000.|$|E
5|$|Written by Joseph Lidster. A story idea {{considered}} for {{the third and fourth}} episodes of the fourth series. It was based upon the notion of 'faces' which people {{used to be able to}} see in patterned wallpaper. While redecorating, one of the Bannerman Road gang was to strip some paint off a wall and reveal old wallpaper underneath. Faces would appear on the wallpaper; <b>these</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> aliens from another dimension trying to arrive on Earth, literally taking shape in walls and stepping through. It was noted that this notion could be adapted for patterns in wooden floors and doors.|$|E
