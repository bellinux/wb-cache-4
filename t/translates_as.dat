5|$|The town's {{coat of arms}} {{depicts the}} old castle that used {{to stand on the}} site of the former prison. The royal purple {{background}} represents Dorchester's status as part of the monarch's private estate, a position held since before the Domesday Book was published. The shield is divided into quarters, two depicting lions and two fleur-de-lis. These are copied from the shields of the troops from Dorset who took part in the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. The fleur-de-lis have a scattered arrangement which shows that permission for the armorial bearings was given before 1405, after which date the rights were varied by King Henry VI.

25|$|Originally, the {{silvicultural}} system now called coppicing was practiced solely for small wood production. In German {{this is called}} Niederwald, which <b>translates</b> <b>as</b> low forest. Later on in Mediaeval times farmers encouraged pigs to feed from acorns and so some trees were allowed to grow bigger. This different {{silvicultural system}} is called in English coppice with standards. In German this is called Mittelwald (middle forest). As modern forestry (Hochwald in German, which <b>translates</b> <b>as</b> High forest) seeks to harvest timber mechanically, and pigs are generally no longer fed from acorns, both systems have declined. However, there are cultural and wildlife benefits from these 2 silvicultural systems so both can be found where timber production or some other main forestry purpose (such as a protection forest against an avalanche) is not the sole management objective of the woodland.|$|E

5000|$|Ionesco's {{earliest}} theatrical works, {{considered to}} be his most innovative, were one-act plays or extended sketches: La Cantatrice Chauve <b>translated</b> <b>as</b> The Bald Soprano or The Bald Prima Donna (written 1948), Jacques ou la soumission <b>translated</b> <b>as</b> Jack, or The Submission (1950), La Leçon <b>translated</b> <b>as</b> The Lesson (1950), Les Salutions <b>translated</b> <b>as</b> Salutations (1950), Les Chaises <b>translated</b> <b>as</b> The Chairs (1951), L'Avenir est dans les oeufs <b>translated</b> <b>as</b> The Future is in Eggs (1951), Victimes du Devoir <b>translated</b> <b>as</b> Victims of Duty (1952) and, finally, Le Nouveau Locataire <b>translated</b> <b>as</b> The New Tenant (1953). These absurdist sketches, to which he gave such descriptions as [...] "anti-play" [...] (anti-pièce in French) express modern feelings of alienation and the impossibility and futility of communication with surreal comic force, parodying the conformism of the bourgeoisie and conventional theatrical forms. In them Ionesco rejects a conventional story-line as their basis, instead taking their dramatic structure from accelerating rhythms and/or cyclical repetitions. He disregards psychology and coherent dialogue, thereby depicting a dehumanized world with mechanical, puppet-like characters who speak in non-sequiturs. Language becomes rarefied, with words and material objects gaining {{a life of their}} own, increasingly overwhelming the characters and creating a sense of menace.|$|R
