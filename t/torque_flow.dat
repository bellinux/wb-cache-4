A power reduction scenario at constant wicket gate opening was numerically analysed from 100 % to 93 % rpm corresponding to a power reduction from full load to about 70 % with a ramp rate of 1. 5 % per second. The flow field analysis led to the onset and development of unsteady phenomena progressively evolving in an organized rotating partial stall during the pump power reduction. These phenomena were characterized by frequency and time-frequency analyses of several numerical signals (pressure, blade <b>torque,</b> <b>flow</b> rate in blade passages).

40|$|Butterfly valves are {{commonly}} used in industrial applications to control the internal flow of both compressible and incompressible fluids. A butterfly valve typically consists of a metal disc formed around a central shaft, which acts as its axis of rotation. As the valve 2 ̆ 7 s opening angle is increased from 0 degrees (fully closed) to 90 degrees (fully open), fluid is able to more readily flow past the valve. Characterizing a valve 2 ̆ 7 s performance factors, such as pressure drop, hydrodynamic <b>torque,</b> <b>flow</b> coefficient, loss coefficient, and torque coefficient, is necessary for fluid system designers to account for system requirements to properly operate the valve and prevent permanent damage from occurring. This comparison study of a 48 -inch butterfly valve 2 ̆ 7 s experimental performance factors using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in an incompressible fluid at Reynolds numbers ranging approximately between 105 to 106 found that for mid-open positions (30 - 60 degrees), CFD was able to appropriately predict common performance factors for butterfly valves.

40|$|The {{start-up}} of {{rocket engine}} turbopumps is generally performed {{only in a}} few seconds. It implies that these pumps reach their nominal operating conditions {{after only a few}} rotations. During these first rotations of the blades, the flow evolution in the pump is governed by transient phenomena, based mainly on the flow rate and rotation speed evolution. These phenomena progressively become negligible when the steady behavior is reached. The pump transient behavior induces significant pressure fluctuations which may result in partial flow vaporization, i. e. cavitation. An existing experimental test rig has been updated in the LML laboratory (Lille, France) for the start-ups of a centrifugal pump. The study focuses on cavitation induced during the pump start-up. Instantaneous measurement of <b>torque,</b> <b>flow</b> rate, inlet and outlet unsteady pressures, and pump rotation velocity enable to characterize the pump behavior during rapid starting periods. Three different types of fast start-up behaviors have been identified. According to the final operating point, the start-up is characterized either by a single drop of the delivery static pressure, by several low-frequency drops, or by a water hammer phenomenon that can be observed both a the inlet and outlet of the pump.

The grooves are axisymmetric V-shaped obstacles attached to the wall with a tip angle of 90 degrees. Results are compared to the smooth wall case in order to investigate the effects of grooves on Taylor-Couette flow. We focus on the effective scaling laws for the <b>torque,</b> <b>flow</b> structures, and boundary layers. It is found that, when the groove height is smaller than the boundary layer thickness, the torque {{is the same as}} that of the smooth wall cases. With increasing Ta, the boundary layer thickness becomes smaller than the groove height. Plumes are ejected from the tips of the grooves and secondary circulations between the latter are formed. This is associated with a sharp increase of the torque, and thus the effective scaling law for the torque versus Ta becomes much steeper. Further increasing Ta does not result in an additional slope increase. Instead, the effective scaling law saturates to the 'ultimate' regime effective exponents seen for smooth walls. It is found that even though after saturation the slope is the same as for the smooth wall case, the absolute value of torque is increased, and more so with the larger size of the grooves...|$|E

40|$|The {{modeling}} {{technique of}} hydrodynamic <b>torque</b> converter <b>flow</b> passage was investigated. The semi-automatic model ing technique of <b>torque</b> converter <b>flow</b> passage was proposed. The flow passage model of each converter wheel is con sidered as a revolution entity sliced by two curved surfaces. In order {{to generate the}} revolution entity, a new approxima tion method, condition optimum arc approximation, was proposed. The method was used to approximate the meridional streamlines of {{the inner and outer}} wall. As a result, the three-dimensional revolution entity can be conveniently gener ated. In order to create slice surfaces, the central stream surface of flow passage was approximated with a quadric sur face. The normal vector of the quadric surface and the thickness/thickness-function of bade were used to calculate the discrete point coordinates of blade surfaces. Via the rotation transformation to the coordinates, the discrete point coordi nates of slice surfaces were obtained. A parameterized program code used for the hydrodynamic torque converter de sign and semi-automatic modeling was developed. Modeling errors were calculated and analyzed.

40|$|Torque Steer is an {{inherent}} phenomenon for the Front Wheel Driven vehicles. It is a torque applied {{on the steering}} wheel when the vehicle is accelerated, produced by suspension compliance, asymmetries in the suspension and steering geometry and road irregularities. This torque is not desired to be felt by the driver. The aim will be study the factors producing torque {{on the steering wheel}}, calculate them under straight and cornering scenarios and distinguish which portion is wanted or unwanted. This information may be used in an EPS controller, which can counteract this torque. A model designed in Matlab/Simulink has been made in order to calculate the factors, with a previous calculation of new positions in geometrical points, the longitudinal, lateral and normal force and where they are applied, the <b>torque</b> <b>flow</b> and the self aligning torque. For that, a list of available sensors installed on most of the vehicle was used and represents the inputs to the model. Some assumptions were made in order to simplify calculations, considering the obtained results did not differ considerably from the real ones. For straight acceleration it was found the torque in the steering wheel was very small (peak of 0. 5 Nm) and mainly due to S. A. T. and the effect of the Secondary Couples. As S. A. T. is assumed to be wanted, Secondary Couples is the factor producing torque steer. In a real straight acceleration, the roll angle is not completely zero, thus it creates asymmetry from left to right side which produces this Secondary Couples effect. When accelerating in a corner, the torque in the steering wheel is due to S. A. T., the Secondary Couples and Normal Force factors. Torque steer is only due to Secondary Couples and has a peak of 8 Nm. It is increasing with roll, and in this case the geometry is totally asymmetric. There is also friction in the differential, due to the different rotational speed of the inner and outer wheels of the curve. To get more accurate results, it is needed a better estimation of the lateral velocity, the friction coefficient, and the suspension travel...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{an effort}} to define the {{conditions}} distinguish-ing underthrusting and subduction in the Venus environment, we have modeled the thermal and buoyancy consequences of the subduction endmember. Predictions of the thermal evolu-tion of a slab subducting at a fixed angle into the Venusian mantle are used to find slab densities based on slab composi-tion and changes of temperature, pressure, and phase. The sustainability of subduction is assessed by considering the effects of slab buoyancy and mantle flow on the subduction angle. Mantle flow induced by slab motion applies torques on the slab, which are compared to buoyancy <b>torques.</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>torques</b> tend to decrease the angle of subduction. Buoyancy torques also act to decrease the subduction a gle when the slab is positively buoyant. The basalt-eclogite phase transition dominates the transformation of positively buoyant slabs to negative buoyancy. Slabs that have descended todepths less than about 275 km remain positively buoyant. Beyond 275 km slabs become negatively buoyant. We predict hat the combina-tion of <b>flow</b> and buoyancy <b>torques</b> will tend to force initially suMucted slabs to assume an underthrusting position, leading to crustal thickening, deformation, melting, and volcanism. This may provide a model explaining the association of com-pressional mountain belts and tessera blocks with apparent flexural rises, foredeeps, and voluminous volcanic deposits. Only special circumstances appear capable of promoting the conditions for negative slab buoyancy. These might include one where an underthrust slab becomes attached to or included in a densifted crustal root created in a zone of crustal thicken-ing. The subsequent delamination and sinking of the root may then lead to the subduction of the slab...|$|R
