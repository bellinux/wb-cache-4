NCMPs enjoy most of the privileges of ordinary Members of Parliament.

An election candidate who has been offered an NCMP seat may decline to take it up.|$|E

5|$|Thio {{also argued}} that without a constitutionally {{expressed}} right to vote, the judiciary is handicapped in interpreting this implied right, given its conservative approach to reading <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>and</b> {{the fact that it}} is unlikely to appeal to normative ideas such as representative democracy.|$|E
5|$|A Non-constituency Member of Parliament ("NCMP") is a {{candidate}} of an opposition political party who, despite having lost in a general election, is declared elected as a Member of the Parliament of Singapore ("MP") by virtue of provisions in <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>and</b> the Parliamentary Elections Act enabling the unsuccessful candidates who have performed the best to be accorded the status.

5|$|Chng Suan Tze was {{followed}} by amendments by Parliament to <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>and</b> the ISA in 1989 which purported to return the applicable law regarding judicial review of government discretion under the ISA to that in Lee Mau Seng. The legality of these changes was challenged in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1990). In that decision, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the legislative amendments to the Act were plain and unambiguous, and thus validly established that the subjective test of judicial review now applied to internal security matters.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{logistical}} problems, the new Polish Commander-in-Chief Jan Krukowiecki, who {{had replaced}} Dembiński in mid-August, ordered a sortie {{on the right}} bank.

Unlike Skrzynecki, he believed foreign intervention to be unrealistic, and wanted to force the Russians to return to peace talks by defeating the Russian forces, breaking the siege or defeating the assault attempts.|$|E

5|$|For the {{constitution}} to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>and</b> call for {{the addition of a}} bill of rights. Four state conventions proposed some form of restriction on the authority of the new federal government to conduct searches.|$|E
5|$|Historian Steven Boyd {{argued that}} the {{suppression}} of the Whiskey Rebellion prompted anti-Federalist westerners to finally accept <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>and</b> to seek change by voting for Republicans rather than resisting the government.
