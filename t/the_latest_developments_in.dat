5|$|The Armada was {{constantly}} being modernized with <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> naval warfare. It adopted steam navigation in the 1830s, ironclad plate armor in the 1860s, and torpedoes in the 1880s. By 1889, Brazil had the fifth or sixth most powerful navy {{in the world}} and the most powerful battleships in the western hemisphere. The Army, despite its highly experienced and battle-hardened officer corps, was plagued during peacetime by units which were badly paid, inadequately equipped, poorly trained and thinly spread across the vast Empire.|$|E

5|$|Pick {{wanted a}} new type of {{building}} for the more open sites of the stations on the Piccadilly line's extensions. To decide what this new type should look like, he and Holden made a short tour of Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands in July and August 1930 to see <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> modern architecture. Pick was disappointed with much of the new architecture that he saw in Germany and Sweden, considering it either too extreme or unsatisfactorily experimental. The architecture in the Netherlands was much more to his liking, particularly buildings by Willem Marinus Dudok in Hilversum. Although the architecture in Denmark was not considered remarkable, Pick was impressed with the way in which designers there were often responsible for all elements of a building including the interior fixtures and fittings.|$|E

25|$|In 1895, {{after more}} than half a century of occupying various sites in Manhattan, the Board of Trustees {{purchased}} a large lot in the South Bronx—then a semi-rural area of the city—at the corner of 141st Street and Southern Boulevard. A new hospital was built; its facilities included <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> medical care. The dedication took place on April 29, 1899. The hospital became a general hospital open to all people without regard to color or creed, although it maintained its founding connection as an institution dedicated to the relief and advancement of black people. During the hospital's reorganization and eventual occupation of the new site, its name was changed to Lincoln Hospital, in honor of president Abraham Lincoln.|$|E

25|$|Tactical {{improvements}} included <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> {{the deployment}} of the traditional Greek phalanx made by men such as Epaminondas of Thebes and Iphicrates of Athens. Philip II improved on these military innovators by using both Epaminondas' deeper phalanx and Iphicrates' combination of a longer spear and smaller and lighter shield. However, the Macedonian king also innovated; he introduced {{the use of a}} much longer spear, the two-handed pike. The Macedonian pike, the sarissa, gave its wielder many advantages both offensively and defensively. For the first time in Greek warfare, cavalry became a decisive arm in battle. The Macedonian army perfected the co-ordination of different troop types, an early example of combined arms tactics — the heavy infantry phalanx, skirmish infantry, archers, light and heavy cavalry, and siege engines were all deployed in battle; each troop type being used to its own particular advantage and creating a synergy of mutual support.|$|E

500|$|USS Texas was a second-class {{battleship}} {{built by}} the United States in the early 1890s, the first American battleship commissioned and the first ship {{named in honor of}} the state of Texas to be {{built by the}} United States. Built in reaction to the acquisition of modern armored warships by several South American countries, Texas was meant to incorporate <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> naval tactics and design. This includes the mounting of her main armament en echelon to allow maximum end-on fire and a heavily-armored redoubt amidships to ensure defensive strength. However, due to the state of U.S. industry at the time, Texas's building time was lengthy, and {{by the time she was}} commissioned, she was already out of date.

He married his fiancée, Winifred Ida Stevens, on 23 December 1936 in a Salvation Army ceremony. They had a daughter and two sons. He completed his Cambridge doctor of philosophy (PhD) degree under Laby's supervision in 1938. It was in three parts: [...] "The ionization and reorganization of an atom in an inner shell, with special reference to the Dirac theory of the electron"; [...] "Some problems in atomic disintegration"; and [...] "Note on the migration of atoms on a surface". Burhop established the first research program in the field in an Australian university, employing scientific equipment that he brought back from Britain. The centrepiece of the research effort was a 300 keV accelerator that produced a homogeneous neutron beam, which he commissioned in August 1939. He gave lectures on modern physics to the undergraduates, and on quantum mechanics to the postgraduates.|$|E
500|$|In 1930, Holden and Pick made {{a tour of}} Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden to see <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> modern architecture. The UERL was {{planning}} extensions of the Piccadilly line to the west, north-west and north of London, and {{a new type of}} station was wanted. Adapting the architectural styles he had seen on the tour, Holden created functional designs composed of simple forms: cylinders, curves and rectangles, built in plain brick, concrete and glass. The extensions to the west and north-west were over existing routes operated by the District line and required a number of stations to be rebuilt to accommodate additional tracks or to replace original, basic buildings. Sudbury Town, the first station to be rebuilt in 1931, formed a template for many of the other new stations that followed: a tall rectangular brick box with a concrete flat roof and panels of vertical glazing to allow light into the interior. The Grade II* listed building was described by Pevsner as [...] "an outstanding example of how satisfying such unpretentious buildings can be, purely through the use of careful details and good proportions." ...|$|E

These vessels would have been of unprecedented size and power, as fast and well armoured as Hood whilst carrying a main battery of ten 16-inch guns, the most powerful armament ever proposed for a battlecruiser. They were, {{for all intents and}} purposes, fast battleships—the only differences between them and the s which were to precede them were [...] less side armour and a [...] increase in speed. The United States Navy, which had worked on its battlecruiser designs since 1913 and watched <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> this class with great care, responded with the [...] If completed as planned, they would have been exceptionally fast and well armed with eight 16-inch guns, but carried armour little better than the Invincibles—this after an [...] increase in protection following Jutland. The final stage in the post-war battlecruiser race came with the British response to the Amagi and Lexington types: four [...] G3 battlecruisers. Royal Navy documents of the period often described any battleship with a speed of over about [...] as a battlecruiser, regardless of the amount of protective armour, although the G3 was considered by most to be a well-balanced fast battleship.|$|E
