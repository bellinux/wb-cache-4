5|$|Hazlitt's {{commentary}} on Twelfth Night uses Shakespeare's play to illustrate {{some of his}} general ideas about comedy, <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> he explored at greater length in later works, such as his Lectures on the English Comic Writers (1819).|$|E
5|$|Yeats is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} twentieth century key English language poets. He was a Symbolist poet, using allusive imagery and symbolic structures throughout his career. He chose words and assembled them so that, in addition to a particular meaning, they suggest abstract <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> may seem more significant and resonant. His use of symbols is usually something physical that is both itself and a suggestion of other, perhaps immaterial, timeless qualities.|$|E
5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E

5000|$|The Generality Constraint, {{according}} to Evans, {{is intended to}} capture the structure that there is in thought. As Evans puts it, [...] "The <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> John is happy has {{something in common with}} the <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Harry is happy, and the <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> John is happy has something in common with the <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> John is sad" [...] (1982, p. 100). The Generality Constraint requires that if one is to have a <b>thought</b> (<b>that</b> John is happy, for example) about an object (John), then one must be able to conceive of the object (John) as having different properties (such as being sad).|$|R
2500|$|The 2013 Pew Research {{study of}} American Jews found <b>that</b> 62% <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> being Jewish was mainly {{a matter of}} ancestry and culture, while 15% <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> it was mainly a matter of religion. Of those who stated {{themselves}} to be Jews by religion, 55% <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> being Jewish was mainly a matter of ancestry and culture, while two-thirds <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> it was not [...] necessary to believe in God to be Jewish.|$|R
5|$|In the {{rebuttal}} phases, {{a witness}} or a rival character provides {{their idea of}} what has happened. The player is able to press them for details, and can present relevant pieces of evidence that contradict what the witness or rival is saying. By doing this, the player gets closer to the truth; it is through confronting suspects during these phases that the player solves the cases. Upon solving a case, the episode is cleared and a new episode is {{made available to the}} player. If the player makes mistakes throughout the game, such as presenting wrong pieces of evidence, attempting to connect two <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> do not match up, or making incorrect choices, a green gauge called the Truth Gauge decreases, representing Edgeworth getting further from the truth. If it is completely emptied, the game ends. By clearing an investigation phase, half of the gauge is restored, and by clearing an episode, the gauge is restored completely.|$|E

25|$|There were 104 ear {{witnesses}} in Dealey Plaza {{who were on}} record with an opinion as to the direction from which the shots came. Fifty-four (51.9%) <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> all shots came {{from the direction of}} the Texas School Book Depository. Thirty-three (31.7%) <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> all shots came from the area of the grassy knoll or the triple underpass. Nine (8.7%) <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> all shots came from a location entirely distinct from the knoll or the depository. Five (4.8%) <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> they heard shots from two locations, and 3 (2.9%) <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the shots came from a direction consistent with both the knoll and the depository.|$|R

25|$|When Hazen and Shaver {{extended}} attachment {{theory to}} romantic relationships in adults, they also included {{the idea of}} working models. Research into adult working models has focused on two issues. First, how are the <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> form working models organized in the mind? Second, how stable are working models across time? These questions are briefly discussed below.|$|E
25|$|Antidepressants are {{recommended}} by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) {{for the treatment of}} generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) that has failed to respond to conservative measures such as education and self-help activities. GAD is a common disorder of which the central feature is excessive worry about a number of different events. Key symptoms include excessive anxiety about multiple events and issues, and difficulty controlling worrisome <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> persists for at least 6 months.|$|E
25|$|According to Camilleri, Bohr <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the {{distinction}} between a wave view and a particle view was defined by a distinction between experimental setups, while, differing, Heisenberg <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> it was defined {{by the possibility of}} viewing the mathematical formulas as referring to waves or particles. Bohr <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> a particular experimental setup would display either a wave picture or a particle picture, but not both. Heisenberg <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> every mathematical formulation was capable of both wave and particle interpretations.|$|R
5|$|Harmon <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Far Cry 4 was an {{improvement}} over Far Cry 3, but he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the game felt and played too similarly to Far Cry 3, and {{he added that the}} game was unambitious. Bertz <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Ubisoft Montreal's vision for Far Cry 4 is not as bold as its predecessors, and also <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the experience delivered by Far Cry 4 did not stray far away from Far Cry 3. Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to Far Cry 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the experience offered by Far Cry 4 was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel. Dyer <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.|$|R
50|$|A YouGov poll, on 24 August 2016, found that, of the 4,454 UK adults surveyed, 57% <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Corbyn {{was being}} dishonest, {{compared}} with 18% who <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> he was not; 58% <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the row did matter, compared with 19% {{who thought it}} did not. However, amongst current Labour voters, 39% believed him against 34% who did not.|$|R
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, a {{successful}} intuitive trader has built his confidence {{as a result}} of a developed awareness of “subtle inner signals.” Bandler and Grinder—the founders of NLP—discovered early on that these inner signals consist of <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> are primarily sensory in nature. In fact, all thoughts, conscious and subconscious, arise as unique combinations of an individual's five senses. Conscious thinking will utilize a person's more developed senses; meanwhile, intuitive thought uses a person's least developed senses.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} crises Hayes {{had to deal with}} was the fallout of Ferrari's {{rejection}} of the proposed Ford takeover. Hayes became part of the team that supported Henry Ford II's <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> Ford should take on Ferrari directly in their own home market of racing. Hayes initiated discussion with Cooper which didn't come to fruition; but agreements with Lotus resulted in a successful Indianapolis 500 program, and with Lola to design, engineer and produce the prototypes of the all conquering Ford GT40.|$|E
25|$|Despite <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> Thomas {{might be}} 'leadership material', Attlee dropped {{him from the}} {{government}} on 7 October 1947, a dismissal which was unexpected. The reason was Thomas' increasing disillusion with socialism. In March 1948 he spoke at an Italian election rally for the moderate Italian Socialist Party calling for a federation of Europe; when {{it was revealed that}} left-wing Labour Members of Parliament had sent a telegram of support to Pietro Nenni, leader of the rival left-wing Italian Socialists, Thomas signed a motion calling for a Select Committee to investigate.|$|E

But none of these philosophers <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> a (metaphysically) necessary truth could fail to be a priori” ...|$|R

25|$|Although {{the first}} <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> {{come to mind}} for most {{machinists}} regarding threading are of thread cutting processes (such as tapping, single-pointing, or helical milling), Smid points out that, when plastic bottles for food, beverages, personal care products, and other consumer products are considered, it is actually plastic molding that is the principal method (by sheer volume) of thread generation in manufacturing today. Of course, this fact {{highlights the importance of}} the moldmakers getting the mold just right (in preparation for millions of cycles, usually at high speed).|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Slife and Williams {{write that}} one of the hidden {{assumptions}} in CBT is that of determinism, or the absence of free will. They argue that CBT invokes a type of cause-and-effect relationship with cognition. They state that CBT holds that external stimuli from the environment enter the mind, causing different <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> cause emotional states. Nowhere in CBT theory is agency, or free will, accounted for. At its most basic foundational assumptions, CBT holds that human beings have no free will and are just determined by the cognitive processes invoked by external stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Arnold {{was elected}} Professor of Poetry at Oxford in 1857, {{and he was}} the first in this {{position}} to deliver his lectures in English rather than in Latin. He was re-elected in 1862. On Translating Homer (1861) and the initial <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> Arnold would transform into Culture and Anarchy were among the fruits of the Oxford lectures. In 1859, he conducted the first of three trips to the continent at the behest of parliament to study European educational practices. He self-published The Popular Education of France (1861), the introduction to which was later published under the title Democracy (1879).|$|E
500|$|The Hunter {{characters}} {{featured in}} the game received praise. Ingenito <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the Hunters in the game were memorable due to their pre-game dialog, and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the dialogue was well written. He called this the [...] "true beauty" [...] of Evolve. Rowan echoed a similar statement, calling the banter [...] "charming". Marchiafava <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the progression system has made the banter between characters repetitive because players need {{to play the game}} continuously to unlock characters. Marchiafava compared the narrative unfavorably to that of Left 4 Dead, and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> it was not emergent enough.|$|R

Horton overplayed their parts [...] "too strongly for laughs". Pauline Kael later praised Grant's performance, and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> he had used his skills developed in vaudeville to good use in the film, displaying a [...] "sense of fun" [...] with [...] "confident, full-hearted exhibitionism".|$|R

25|$|The {{hypothesis}} of An Action-based Model of Cognitive-dissonance Processes (2015) proposed that psychological dissonance occurs consequent to the stimulation of <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> interfere with a goal-driven behavior. Researchers mapped the neural {{activity of the}} participant when performing tasks that provoked psychological stress when engaged in contradictory behaviors. A participant read aloud the printed name of a color. To test for the occurrence of cognitive dissonance, {{the name of the}} color was printed in a color different than the word read aloud by the participant. As a result, the participants experienced increased neural activity in the anterior cingulate cortex when the experimental exercises provoked psychological dissonance.|$|E
25|$|Third-wave {{feminism}} harmonizes the <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> while {{individuals have}} rights, overarching inequalities hinder women's capabilities. Third-wave feminism also considers {{that women who}} are trafficked and face oppression do not all face {{the same kinds of}} oppression. For example, third-wave feminist proponent Shelley Cavalieri identifies oppression and privilege in the intersections of race, class, and gender. Women from low socioeconomic class, generally from the Global South, face inequalities that differ from those of other sex trafficking victims. Therefore, it advocates for catering to individual trafficking victim because sex trafficking is not monolithic, and therefore there is not a one-size-fits-all intervention. This also means allowing individual victims to tell their unique experiences rather than essentializing all trafficking experiences. Lastly, third-wave feminism promotes increasing women's agency both generally and individually, so that they have the opportunity to act on their own behalf.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong conferred with Major General Henry Dearborn, {{commander}} of the American Army of the North, at Albany, New York during February. Both Dearborn and Chauncey agreed with Armstrong's plan at this point, but they subsequently had second <b>thoughts.</b> <b>That</b> month, Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, the British Governor General of Canada, travelled up the frozen Saint Lawrence to visit Upper Canada. This visit was made necessary because Major General Roger Hale Sheaffe, who had succeeded Brock as Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, was ill and unable to perform his various duties. Prevost was accompanied only by a few small detachments of reinforcements, which participated in the Battle of Ogdensburg en route. Nevertheless, both Chauncey and Dearborn believed that Prevost's arrival indicated an imminent attack on Sackett's Harbor, and reported that Kingston now had a garrison of 6,000 or more British regulars.|$|E
500|$|Critics had divided {{opinions}} on the game's multiplayer. Camron <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> {{it was a nice}} addition to the game, even though he thought it lacked the complexity a multiplayer mode should have, and that it failed to extend the game's longevity. Miller echoed this statement, and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the multiplayer mode failed to hook players. Walton <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> players would not return the mode after experiencing it once, and he described the mode as [...] "bland". Albert, in contrast, considered the mode a unique addition to the game, and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> it had successfully added some strategy elements to the game. Chris Carter from Destructoid <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the multiplayer mode was better than the game's main campaign. He described it as a [...] "pleasant surprise".|$|R
