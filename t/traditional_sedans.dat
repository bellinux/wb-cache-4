50|$|The <b>traditional</b> <b>sedans</b> with full-width bench seating offered {{nearly the}} same {{passenger}} capacity as the newer three-row SUV or minivan. Some models, such as the Chrysler Pacifica, feature a center console in the second row, rather than room for a passenger in the middle.|$|E
50|$|The Sigma {{designation}} disappeared {{with the}} 1990 model. A new hardtop liftback model was added in 1988, called the (Mitsubishi Eterna). and in Japan, the Eterna was only {{sold at a}} specific retail chain called Car Plaza. This generation Galant was also sold in Canada as the Dodge 2000GTX and Eagle 2000GTX. The five-door liftback version was never offered in North America, where buyers prefer <b>traditional</b> <b>sedans.</b> Sales ended in 1993.|$|E
5000|$|For the 1955 {{model year}} the Fairlane name {{replaced}} the Crestline as Ford's premier full-sized offering. Six different body styles were offered, including the Crown Victoria Skyliner with a tinted, transparent plastic roof, the regular Crown Victoria coupe {{with lots of}} stainless steel trim, a convertible Sunliner, the Victoria hardtop coupe, and <b>traditional</b> <b>sedans.</b> All featured the trademark stainless-steel [...] "Fairlane stripe" [...] on the side. Power options were a 223 CID L straight-6 engine and a 272 CID L V8. The 292 CID L Y-block was offered as an option and was called the Thunderbird V-8.|$|E
5000|$|BMW 1 Series for $19,000 vs <b>traditional</b> BMW <b>sedans</b> for $50,000 ...|$|R
50|$|The {{bi-parting}} doors typically {{feature a}} longer {{front door and}} a short rear door, without a pillar in between. The configuration offers both a more 'sporty' aesthetic than compared to a <b>traditional</b> <b>sedan,</b> and the utility of 4-doors, though the doors operate inter-subdependently. This means that the forward door must always be opened before the rear-door (which opens in a rear-hinged fashion) can be opened.|$|R
2500|$|All {{versions}} {{with the}} exception of the wagon were usually fitted with the four round tail lights that had become a regular feature to the Skyline's design. The wagon had different tail lights, headlights, and no turbo or six-cylinder versions available. It more closely resembled a Nissan Sunny than a Skyline. The two-door coupé had a hardtop, pillarless design, and featured roll-down quarter windows for the rear seat passengers (a styling feature of the previous C10, C110, and C211 coupes), while four-door versions had a <b>traditional</b> <b>sedan</b> body style with framed windows. The crease that appeared over the rear wheels beginning with the second generation, referred to as the [...] "surf line", no longer appeared starting with this generation.|$|R
5000|$|Within {{six months}} of the Airflow's introduction, the vehicle was a sales disaster. Adding insult to injury, General Motors mounted an {{advertising}} campaign aimed at further discrediting the Airflows. Most automotive historians, though, agree that the Airflow was shunned in large part because buyers did not like its looks. The hood, waterfall grille, headlamps, and fenders were all merged into one continuous form that was interpreted as an [...] "anonymous lump". While thoroughly modern, the public was slow to embrace the Airflow. At the depth of the Great Depression, the car seemed to be too advanced, too different for many consumers. While Airflows sold in respectable numbers in its first year, Chrysler's <b>traditional</b> <b>sedans</b> and coupes far outsold the Airflow by 2.5 to one, with first year Airflow sales at 10,839 units.|$|E
50|$|Styled by Roy Axe, the Simca 1307, {{along with}} the {{recently}} introduced Volkswagen Passat, {{was one of several}} full-size European family hatchback inspired by the Renault 16 that had defined the sector back in 1965. In the 1970s the most popular mid-size cars in Europe were still <b>traditional</b> <b>sedans</b> like Ford Taunus (Ford Cortina in Britain), Opel Ascona B (Vauxhall Cavalier) and Morris Marina, and indeed it would be the next generations of those competing vehicles (the Ford Sierra and the Ascona C) before the concept became fully accepted in the mainstream. The car was originally manufactured in Poissy in France, in Ryton in the United Kingdom, from 1977 in Villaverde in Barreiros, subsidiary of Chrysler Europe in Spain, and assembled from CKD kits by Todd Motors (later Mitsubishi Motors NZ) in New Zealand between 1977 and about 1983. Between 1979 and 1985 the car was also built by Valmet Automotive in Uusikaupunki factory in Finland and assembled in Colombia as Dodge Alpine between 1978 and 1982 at the Chrysler Colmotores in Bogotá.|$|E
25|$|Under a {{partnership}} agreement {{that was developed}} in 1961 with the French automaker Renault, the Rebel's two-door hardtop was added {{for the first time}} to the <b>traditional</b> 4-door <b>sedan</b> body style of the Renault Rambler. The new for 1967 designs were assembled in Haren, Belgium and sold by Renault dealers in Algeria, Austria, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.|$|R
50|$|All had {{a slight}} face lift for the 1985 model year. The Corcel II became known again simply as the Corcel. The {{interior}} was now {{the same for all}} four models. Externally, the Corcel and the Del Rey differed at the rear; the Corcel received fastback-style bodywork while the Del Rey was of a more <b>traditional</b> <b>sedan</b> design. The Belina and the Scala, however, had by now lost nearly all of their interior/exterior differences and became near identical: only a few details, such as the taillamps, differentiated these two models. Between 1985 and 1987 the Belina was made available with the same four-wheel-drive system used in the Pampa. This system seemed to have questionable reliability; Quatro Rodas magazine did a long-term test of a Belina 4x4 (50,000 km) in which breakdowns were very frequent - the resulting bad reputation led to Belina 4x4 production ending after only a few model years, while the Pampa 4x4 continued to be available.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} the car has been changed to a more {{conservative}} appearance. The [...] "fluidic sculpture" [...] design that persisted across the Hyundai portfolio since 2011 is gone in the sixth generation Elantra. The car is now more like a fastback with its roofline sloped from the windshield {{to the rear of}} the car and it has less curves overall with pentagonal head and tail lights, a hexagonal grille, and redesigned body panels and bumper emphasizing straight lines along the body. The windshield is drawn back from the hood further than the prior generation, making for a more <b>traditional</b> <b>sedan</b> look. The interior is also less curved, with a cockpit, audio/temp controls and glove compartment in a single bow line across the dash. This was done without reducing the interior cabin space of the prior generation at 110.2 cubic feet (while the Elantra is sold under the compact class, it classifies as a mid-size sedan according to the EPA.) ...|$|R
25|$|Further test {{vehicles}} were a <b>traditional</b> four-door <b>sedan</b> body style {{based on the}} Alfa Romeo Giulietta, an altogether different platform from the 2006 mini MPV Dodge Hornet concept vehicle. Late in 2011, the automaker surprised industry pundits and insiders with an announcement that its new small sedan, {{which was to be}} revealed fully at the North American International Auto Show in January 2012, would be called the Dart.|$|R
50|$|The {{trend towards}} a more steeply raked rear window on <b>traditional</b> three-box <b>sedans</b> blurs the {{distinction}} between fastback and notchback designs. However, {{the roof of a}} true fastback design slopes down continuously to the rear, most often {{to the base of the}} trunk at the rear bumper. There is no distinct change of angle to a rear deck, whereas most four-door cars with steeply raked rear windows have less angled trunk lids; also, high-tail designs maximized cargo space.|$|R
50|$|The Fifth Avenue also far outsold its Dodge Diplomat and Plymouth Gran Fury siblings, with a {{much greater}} {{proportion}} of sales going to private customers, despite its higher price tag. Production peaked at 118,000 cars for 1986 and the Fifth Avenue stood out in a by-now K-car dominated lineup as Chrysler's lone concession to <b>traditional</b> RWD American <b>sedans.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{car is a}} {{notchback}} sedan {{version of}} the European C4 model, since the Chinese market prefers <b>traditional</b> three-box <b>sedans</b> over hatchbacks. It did not keep the designation, however, because in Chinese, the number [...] "4" [...] is unlucky. The sedan is {{much larger than the}} hatchback: its length is 4770 mm over the hatchback's 4260 mm and its wheelbase measures 2710 mm against 2610 mm of the hatchback. This caused the C-Triomphe sedan to be classified in the large family car class. The C-Triomphe has a number of unique features, such as an integrated air freshener, which allows the driver to choose the scent of the interior.|$|R
50|$|After {{a one-year}} hiatus, a {{redesigned}} LHS {{was introduced in}} 1998 for MY1999. It featured the new winged emblem of the Chrysler division. With {{the introduction of the}} 300M and the discontinuation of the New Yorker, the second generation LHS competed with <b>traditional</b> large luxury <b>sedans</b> such as the Lincoln Continental and Toyota Avalon while the shorter and sportier 300M competed in the performance luxury market.|$|R
5000|$|The T150 Corona {{was known}} as the Corona FF, selling {{alongside}} the more traditional and recently facelifted rear-wheel-drive Corona (T140-series). Essentially a shortened version of the Camry, this was part of Toyota's very cautious approach to introducing front-wheel-drive vehicles. Toyota returned to a platform naming tradition, assigned to different body styles this generation was made available, abandoned in 1978. The Corona FF as introduced in January 1983 was only available with a five-door liftback body style, and only with the carburetted [...] 1.8-litre 1S-LU inline-four. In October 1983 a more <b>traditional</b> four-door <b>sedan</b> was added, and the T150 gradually became {{the main part of the}} Corona lineup as the T140-series shrank in importance.|$|R
50|$|Also to {{be noted}} {{is that while}} earlier North American-market Nissan Sentras were very similar to their Japan-market B-series Nissan Sunny twins, the B15 Sentra (2000-2006) diverged greatly from the B15 Sunny. The Sentra B15 body looks similar to the aero-look B14 body, while the Sunny B15 body is return to the more <b>traditional</b> squared-off three-box <b>sedan</b> design. In Japan the B15 was marketed as the Nissan Super Sunny.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2007, Citroën {{announced}} that the four-door C4 would be built in Argentina. The Argentinian and Brazilian versions are sold as the C4 Pallas in some South American and European markets. The car is essentially a notchback sedan version of the European C4 model, since the Chinese market prefers <b>traditional</b> three-box <b>sedans</b> over hatchbacks. It did not keep the designation, however, because in Chinese the number [...] "4" [...] is unlucky. The sedan is {{much larger than the}} hatchback: its length is 4770 mm over the hatchback's 4260 mm and its wheelbase measures 2710 mm against 2610 mm of the hatchback. This caused the C-Triomphe sedan to be classified in large family car class. The C-Triomphe has a number of unique features, such as an integrated air freshener which allows the driver to choose the smell of the interior.|$|R
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the Debonair's {{perceived}} primary purpose as a [...] "senior executive vehicle", it did not undergo regular improvements to its exterior appearance, while the mechanicals were routinely updated with the latest advancements as the years progressed. The engine displacement was held to the 2.0 litre limit to minimize the annual road tax bill, and if it could be justified that the car was for business use, the tax liability was further reduced. The international introduction of the Honda Legend in 1986 influenced many <b>traditional</b> Japanese luxury <b>sedans</b> to update the appearance of their vehicles, including the Debonair.|$|R
50|$|The first Cresta was {{introduced}} April 1980 and was available exclusively at the renamed Toyota Vista Store (formerly Toyota Auto Store) sales channels across Japan, joining the recently introduced Chaser. The Cresta was positioned as a high-level luxury sedan {{just below the}} established, <b>traditional</b> luxury <b>sedan,</b> the Crown. The sales goal of the Cresta was to provide buyers with a luxury sedan, but not incur tax consequences for exceeding dimension regulations, the vehicle was limited to an engine size at 2000cc as well as dimensions under 4.7 m long, 1.7 m wide, and 2 m high, and allowing another Toyota dealership network to offer a luxury-sports oriented product originally exclusive to Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations. The Cresta {{was introduced}} with halogen headlights to provide a modern European appearance, and was available with {{a full range of}} luxury amenities and conveniences. The SOHC 2.0 L M-EU engine was used with an automatic transmission only, which was shared with the Crown, as well as the 2.0L 1G-EU straight six engine, also used in the Crown. Trim levels used names meant to suggest luxury overtones, such as Super Lucent, Super Touring, Super Deluxe, Super Custom, and Custom, names that were similarly used on the Crown. Upper level trim levels used two-tone paint schemes to further the Cresta's elevated status towards a younger demographic. The Nissan competitor was the Laurel.|$|R
50|$|There are roads, waterways, {{railways}} and one airport. The <b>traditional</b> paalkee (<b>sedans),</b> tomtom (horse carriages) and gorur gaari (bullock carts) are {{now going}} out of the fashion. The Nosimon and Korimon, locally made mechanical hauler using irrigation pumps as main engine, are mainly used for transporting agricultural goods and rural folks. Inexpensive Chinese electric and petrol autobikes (tricycle) are getting popularity as urban transport. Dhaka is about five hours by road. Hardinge Bridge and Lalon Shah Bridge over the Padma linked Pabna with Kushtia District as well as Khulna Division and the southern Bangladesh. Before the Partition of India, {{it was a major}} stoppage for trains from Kolkata to Assam and Darjeeling.The Hardinge Bridge already passed a glorious and historical hundred years. Pabna is also connected to Dhaka by the age old roadway through the Jamuna River crossing at Nogorbari, opposite to the river crossing of Aricha at Manikgonj District. It is also very well communicated with Dhaka by modern roads through Jamuna Bridge. There is no rail link to Pabna town; nearby rail stations are situated in Chatmohar Upazila and Ishwardi Upazila. Ishwardi Upazila is one of the important railway junctions of the North Bengal as well as in Bangladesh. There are nine rail stations in this district: Ishwardi, Ishwardi Bypass, Pakshi, Muladuli, Chatmohar, Bhangura, Baral Bridge, Sharat Nagar, Dilpashar and Guakhara. Pabna is well connected by road, rail, river or air {{to the rest of the}} country.|$|R
