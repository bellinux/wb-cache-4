Additionally, Will Yun Lee was cast as Harada, and Brian Tee as Noburo Mori. By July 2012, Deadline.com said Jessica Biel would play Viper. However, at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, Biel said {{her role in}} the film was [...] "not a done deal", explaining, [...] "People keep talking about this. I don't know {{anything}} about it. It's a little bit too soon for <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> announcement". A few days later, negotiations between Biel and 20th Century Fox had broken down. Later in July, Fox had begun talks with Svetlana Khodchenkova to take over the role. Somewhat unusually for action movies, The Wolverine features four female lead roles and [...] "passes the Bechdel Test early and often", according to Vulture. Mangold noted that he wrote his heroines so that [...] "they all have missions.

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the acclaim lavished on the song, some of Wilson's pop and rock contemporaries have been tempered in their praise of [...] "Good Vibrations". When asked about the song in 1990, Paul McCartney responded: [...] "I {{thought it was a}} great record. It didn't quite have the emotional thing that Pet Sounds had for me. I've often played Pet Sounds and cried. It's <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> album for me." [...] Pete Townshend of the Who was quoted in the 1960s as saying, [...] "'Good Vibrations' was probably a good record but who's to know? You had to play it about 90 bloody times to even hear what they were singing about." [...] Townshend feared that the single would lead to a trend of overproduction. In a 1966 issue of Arts Magazine, Jonathan King said: [...] "With justification, comments are being passed that 'Good Vibrations' is an inhuman work of art. Computerized pop, mechanized music. Take a machine, feed in various musical instruments, add a catch phrase, stir well, and press seven buttons. It is long and split. ... impressive, fantastic, commercial—yes. Emotional, soul-destroying, shattering—no." [...] In the 2000s, record producer Phil Spector criticized the single for depending too much on tape manipulation, negatively referring to it as an [...] "edit record ... It's like Psycho is a great film, but it's an 'edit film.' Without edits, it's not a film; with edits, it's a great film. But it's not Rebecca ... it's not a beautiful story." ...|$|E

A woman as large as Aunt Matilda could not be {{supported}} on <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> income, it was plain enough.|$|E

Such marriage was in the beginning; such shall it always be in my house. The hand of the man takes the woman's ear, and by it leads her away to his house, where she is to be obedient to him and to his mother. I was taken by the ear, so, by your long honourably dead father. I have looked at your hand. It is not like his hand. Also have I looked at the ear of Li Faa. Never will you lead her by the ear. She has not <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ear. I shall live a long time yet, and I will be mistress in my son's house, after our ancient way, until I die." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{think she}} once prized {{money for the}} ease and comfort it could bring, the showy vanities it could furnish, and the social {{promotion}} it could command; for {{we have seen that}} she was born into the world with little ways and instincts and aspirations and affectations that are duplicates of our own. I do not think her money-passion has ever diminished in ferocity, I do not think that she has ever allowed a dollar that had no friends to get by her alive, but I think her reason for wanting it has changed. I think she wants it now to increase and establish and perpetuate her power and glory with, not to add to her comforts and luxuries, not to furnish paint and fuss and feathers for vain display. I think her ambitions have soared away above the fuss-and-feather stage. She still likes the little shows and vanities--a fact which she exposed in a public utterance two or three days ago when she was not noticing--but I think she does not place a large value upon them now. She could build a mighty and far-shining brass-mounted palace if she wanted to, but she does not do it. She would have had <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ambition in the early scrabbling times. She could go to England to-day and be worshiped by earls, and get a comet's attention from the million, if she cared for such things. She would have gone in the early scrabbling days for much less than an earl, and been vain of it, and glad to show off before the remains of the Scotch kin. But those things are very small to her now--next to invisible, observed through the cloud-rack from the dizzy summit where she perches in these great days. She does not want that church property for herself. It is worth but a quarter of a million--a sum she could call in from her far-spread flocks to-morrow with a lift of her hand. Not a squeeze of it, just a lift. It would come without a murmur; come gratefully, come gladly. And if her glory stood in more need of the money in Boston than it does where her flocks are propagating it, she would lift the hand, I think.|$|E
6000|$|Inherited {{ideas are}} a curious thing, and {{interesting}} {{to observe and}} examine. I had mine, the king and his people had theirs. In both cases they flowed in ruts worn deep by time and habit, {{and the man who}} should have proposed to divert them by reason and argument would have had a long contract on his hands. For instance, those people had inherited the idea that all men without title and a long pedigree, whether they had great natural gifts and acquirements or hadn't, were creatures of no more consideration than so many animals, bugs, insects; whereas I had inherited the idea that human daws who can consent to masquerade in the peacock-shams of inherited dignities and unearned titles, are of no good but to be laughed at. The way I was looked upon was odd, but it was natural. You know how the keeper and the public regard the elephant in the menagerie: well, that is the idea. They are full of admiration of his vast bulk and his prodigious strength; they speak with pride {{of the fact that he}} can do a hundred marvels which are far and away beyond their own powers; and they speak with the same pride of the fact that in his wrath he is able to drive a thousand men before him. But does that make him one of them? No; the raggedest tramp in the pit would smile at the idea. He couldn't comprehend it; couldn't take it in; couldn't in any remote way conceive of it. Well, to the king, the nobles, and all the nation, down to the very slaves and tramps, I was just <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> elephant, and nothing more. I was admired, also feared; but it was as an animal is admired and feared. The animal is not reverenced, neither was I; I was not even respected. I had no pedigree, no inherited title; so in the king's and nobles' eyes I was mere dirt; the people regarded me with wonder and awe, but there was no reverence mixed with it; through the force of inherited ideas they were not able to conceive of anything being entitled to that except pedigree and lordship. There you see the hand of that awful power, the Roman Catholic Church. In two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms. Before the day of the Church's supremacy in the world, men were men, and held their heads up, and had a man's pride and spirit and independence; and what of greatness and position a person got, he got mainly by achievement, not by birth. But then the Church came to the front, with an axe to grind; and she was wise, subtle, and knew more than one way to skin a cat--or a nation; she invented [...] "divine right of kings," [...] and propped it all around, brick by brick, with the Beatitudes --wrenching them from their good purpose to make them fortify an evil one; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience to superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice; she preached (to the commoner) meekness under insult; preached (still to the commoner, always to the commoner) patience, meanness of spirit, non-resistance under oppression; and she introduced heritable ranks and aristocracies, and taught all the Christian populations of the earth to bow down to them and worship them. Even down to my birth-century that poison was still in the blood of Christendom, and the best of English commoners was still content to see his inferiors impudently continuing to hold a number of positions, such as lordships and the throne, to which the grotesque laws of his country did not allow him to aspire; in fact, he was not merely contented with this strange condition of things, he was even able to persuade himself that he was proud of it. It seems to show that there isn't anything you can't stand, if you are only born and bred to it. Of course that taint, that reverence for rank and title, had been in our American blood, too--I know that; but when I left America it had disappeared--at least to all intents and purposes. The remnant of it was restricted to the dudes and dudesses. When a disease has worked its way down to that level, it may fairly be said to be out of the system.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Puregrainaudio.com, Rygg commented on the inspiration behind Wars Of The Roses, “I think {{the last couple of}} years we've been getting kind of wanting to make not only kind of cinematical music but also pictorial lyrics to accompany it, so I think <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> idea we've taken a bit further this time, whereas the music itself is a bit more fragmented, the songs are more of individual pieces, as opposed to Shadows, which was a more holistic thing. Also lyrically, it may be a bit more internalised on this one. It's kind of like painting lyrical postcards almost, touching on cultural traditions and things like that.” ...|$|E

50|$|The {{atmosphere}} in Sebkha-Chott's show is quite particular: the absurd basement {{is such that}} the content might not be taken seriously, though, the audience sollicitation is so strong (especially when the audience doesn't react spontaneously) <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> embarrassment or even mistrust might occur. Whatever might be the audience reactions, Sebkha-Chott's Kourt lays on them to build the show. Each concert thus is a unique event, as neither the setlist, nor the speeches are defined by advance. Still, there are some never-changing things: the shows open on a triumphal incoming of the Kourt (since 2007), which quickly leads to Tyrant's speech, and they {{end up on the}} death of every member of Sebkah-Chott's Kourt, killed by the Tyrant, mainly.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} gain {{interest}} in SICSAM, Sammet wrote letters to people she identified through publications and {{what was happening in}} the field at that time. She identified people at Bell Labs, Carnegie Mellon, and IBM who were in different divisions and groups. Sammet faced resistance from the interest group on numerical analysis in ACM. Roughly five years after SICSAM formed, there was a conference about mathematical software called SIGNUM. Sammet states that she fought her way to give a paper at SIGNUM because the group was not interested in non-numerical analysis of <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> activity. With assistance from those interested in SICSAM, Sammet organized a conference held in March 1966, which was the Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation (SYMSAM).|$|E
