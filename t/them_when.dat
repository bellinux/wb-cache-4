5|$|After {{releasing}} Pure, Westenra and {{her family}} moved to London. She continues to reside in a central London flat, even though her family subsequently returned home to Christchurch. Although she spent most of 2006 touring, she did visit <b>them</b> <b>when</b> her schedule allowed.|$|E
5|$|Both {{varieties}} {{were sold}} by the centennial commission for $1, and primarily went to citizens of Alabama; banks throughout the state vended <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> {{they could not be}} sold, 5,000 of the plain variety were returned to the Mint and melted.|$|E
5|$|Coinage of eagles did not resume until 1838 (after Congress {{decreased}} the gold content of American coins, eliminating {{the incentive to}} export <b>them),</b> <b>when</b> a new design, by Christian Gobrecht, was struck.|$|E
6000|$|... "The pesky rascals!" [...] he muttered. [...] "Yer brother told {{us about}} <b>'em</b> <b>when</b> he stopped here {{on his way to}} the {{railroad}} station. It's a pity Ike Watson didn't plug every one of <b>'em</b> <b>when</b> he had the chance. Next thing yer know they'll be runnin' off with a bunch o' cattle." ...|$|R

5|$|Scorpions perform non-bluffing threat displays, as {{they have}} {{powerful}} defences, but various predators still eat <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> provoked, they spread their pincers {{and in some cases}} raise their abdomens, their tails standing near-erect with the sting ready for immediate use. Some scorpions in addition produce deimatic noises by stridulating with the pedipalps and first legs.|$|E
5|$|She began {{studying}} {{dance at the}} age of five and started gymnastics three years later, in 1996. She trained with Mihai and Silvia Brestyan at a club called Gymnastics and More, and followed <b>them</b> <b>when</b> they opened their own facility in Ashland, Massachusetts. The Brestyans served as Sacramone's coaches {{for the rest of her}} career.|$|E
5|$|Teku – local Indian tracker and {{independent}} witness at the trial; previously the search party's guide who had abandoned <b>them</b> <b>when</b> they insisted on entering uncharted {{regions of the}} jungle, he continued tracking them from a distance before revealing himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall need," [...] he said {{suddenly}} to his Inspector, [...] "about ten couple. I'll get <b>'em</b> <b>when</b> I go home. You'll be Whip, Baker?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And clever, too--I {{was always}} a stupid chap, I was--but you see, sir, I know <b>'em</b> <b>when</b> they are clever, and like 'em of that sort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So you have--; {{picked him}} up, as you're always a doing with young men. Only {{you never know}} how to keep <b>'em</b> <b>when</b> you've got 'em." ...|$|R
5|$|All {{actions have}} the above four factor present in <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> {{different}} permutations of the sub-elements {{of the four}} factors are calculated, the Jain teachers speak of 108 {{ways in which the}} karmic matter can be attracted to the soul. Even giving silent assent or endorsement to acts of violence from far away has karmic consequences for the soul. Hence, the scriptures advise carefulness in actions, awareness of the world, and purity in thoughts as means to avoid the burden of karma.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the player}} has no direct {{control over the}} patients, they have some {{influence}} over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining {{what to do with}} <b>them</b> <b>when</b> given a choice by the staff. The player can pick up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E
5|$|Another change made in Emerald is the {{addition}} of Team Magma's base {{on the side of}} Mt. Chimney; moreover, the legendary Pokémon Groudon is found here, rather than in the Cave of Origin. Even though the locations of the legendary Pokémon are different, Team Magma still makes the mistake of taking the blue orb to Groudon, while Team Aqua still makes the mistake of taking the red orb to Kyogre. A new character named Scott is also introduced in this game. Unknown to the player, he is the creator of the Battle Frontier. He follows the player throughout the game, watching them battle each Gym Leader and even meeting up with <b>them</b> <b>when</b> they get to the Battle Frontier.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's queer {{that crowd}} should be here, after what {{happened}} in Butte," [...] he said. [...] "I'll ask Dick Logan about <b>'em,</b> <b>when</b> we go to breakfast." ...|$|R
6000|$|A shade--and a {{very deep}} shade it was--of {{disappointment}} passed over his face, and then, looking up anxiously, he asked, [...] "Don't you swap <b>'em</b> <b>when</b> they're bad?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They were gentlemen {{who died}} for their king, sir. My dear brother George and I always {{said we would}} salute <b>'em</b> <b>when</b> we saw 'em," [...] Mr. Warrington said.|$|R
5|$|As I sifted the {{evidence}} this became {{less and less}} convincing to me until I concluded that the opposite was closer to the truth: that the Métis grievances were at least partly of their own making; {{that the government was}} on the verge of resolving <b>them</b> <b>when</b> the Rebellion broke out; That Riel's resort to arms could not be explained by the failure of constitutional agitation and that he received a surprisingly fair trial.|$|E
5|$|At 1:24 pm, Murray emailed a work {{supervisor}} of the nursing school faculty {{that she would be}} out of town for a week due to a death in her family; no one in her family had died. She also said she would contact <b>them</b> <b>when</b> she returned. At 2:05 pm she called a number which provides recorded information about booking hotels in Stowe, Vermont. The call lasted approximately five minutes. At 2:18 pm, she telephoned her boyfriend and left a voice message promising him they would talk later. This call ended after one minute.|$|E
5|$|At the FBI Academy, Dana Scully reads Mulder's initial report. The only {{connection}} between the murders that he can see is that the suspects all destroyed an electronic device during the killings. Meanwhile, Bonnie McRoberts, another Franklin resident, drops by a repair shop {{to pick up her}} car, where a message on an engine diagnostic display warns her that the mechanic is going to rape her. She impulsively kills him with an oil can spout. When Mulder and Spencer question her the next morning, her kitchen microwave instructs her to kill <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> she grabs a knife and attacks Mulder, she is shot and killed by Spencer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Three hundred, more or less, master, but I ain't rightly sure; there's such a {{many that}} it's {{difficult}} to count <b>'em</b> <b>when</b> {{they are all}} a-movin' to and fro." ...|$|R
60|$|I 'eld my breath. Five sailormen {{out of ten}} {{have been}} tattooed with mermaids, and I was one of <b>'em.</b> <b>When</b> she spoke agin I thought I should ha' dropped.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{you don't}} take <b>'em,</b> <b>when</b> the Signore put 'em into your very hand? All {{you do is}} put him in your pocket, and say, 'Eccellenza, what you please to wish?'" ...|$|R
5|$|Cochrane {{prepared}} for {{an encounter with}} this Spanish vessel by painting Speedy to resemble a Danish brig then in the Mediterranean, the Clomer. He also appointed a Dane as quartermaster and found him a Danish naval officer's uniform. While cruising off Alicante on 21 December, Speedy encountered an enemy frigate, but tricked her into thinking she was a neutral vessel. Cochrane again used this false flag technique to his advantage; on 22January he was sailing with a convoy of Danish merchantmen under a Danish flag, pretending to escort <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> a 10-gun French ship and 8-gun Spanish brig approached, Cochrane hoisted British colours and attacked, capturing both of them.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the growth}} of the Internet, the {{characteristics}} of local area networks (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> they are not connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.|$|E
5|$|During the Hundred Years' War, {{the army}} of King Edward III besieged Calais, and Edward ordered that the town's {{population}} be killed en masse. He agreed to spare them if six of the principal citizens would come to him prepared to die, bareheaded and barefooted and with ropes around their necks. When they came, he ordered that they be executed, but pardoned <b>them</b> <b>when</b> his queen, Philippa of Hainault, begged him to spare their lives. The Burghers of Calais depicts the men as they are leaving for the king's camp, carrying keys to the town's gates and citadel.|$|E
6000|$|Said {{a man in}} {{the crowd}} beside us to the girl on his arm, [...] "There, Jenny! That's what I'll get if I 'ave the luck to meet <b>'em</b> <b>when</b> my time comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here {{is where}} they ought to pass," [...] {{announced}} Jarley Bangs. [...] "Now then, we'll put our horses in the thicket and then {{see what we can}} do toward pocketing <b>'em</b> <b>when</b> they come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] {{interrupted}} Miss Stivergill. [...] "Put 'em off. Fulfil <b>'em</b> <b>when</b> {{you come}} back. At all events," [...] she continued, seeing that Miss Lillycrop still hesitated, [...] "come {{for a night}} or two." ...|$|R
5|$|During the day, tammars {{stay close}} to scrub for shade and move out to more open {{grassland}} by nightfall. Like all macropods, the tammar is herbivorous. They are known to both graze and browse, but the latter is less effective, as they commonly drop leaves when chewing on <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> eating large leaves, tammars handle them with their forelimbs. This species spends more time chewing its food than other similar sized macropods, which likely aids digestion. Tammars commonly feed on acacia seeds. Other species consumed include heart-leaved poison (Gastrolobium bilobum), small-flowered wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia setacea), and marri (Corymbia calophylla). Tammars survive on several islands that have no fresh water, subsisting on seawater and the moisture in plants.|$|E
5|$|Eddie Izzard as {{the voice}} of Reepicheep, a swashbuckling mouse. Over 100 actors auditioned to voice the character. Izzard {{approached}} Reepicheep as less camp and more of a bloodthirsty assassin with a sense of honour (a cross between Mad Max and a Stormtrooper from Star Wars): Izzard interpreted Reepicheep as someone whose family was killed by the Telmarines. The Narnia series were some of the few books Izzard read as a child, and he cherished <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> discussing Reepicheep to the animators, Adamson told them to rent as many Errol Flynn films as possible. Adamson credits Izzard for making the role his own; beforehand, the director was approaching the character similarly to Puss in Boots in Shrek 2.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower gave Nixon {{responsibilities}} {{during his}} term as vice president—more {{than any previous}} vice president. Nixon attended Cabinet and National Security Council meetings and chaired <b>them</b> <b>when</b> Eisenhower was absent. A 1953 tour of the Far East succeeded in increasing local goodwill toward the United States and prompted Nixon to appreciate {{the potential of the}} region as an industrial center. He visited Saigon and Hanoi in French Indochina. On his return to the United States at the end of 1953, Nixon increased the amount of time he devoted to foreign relations.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much better, captain. I {{never would}} have dreamed of it, boys. And to think I couldn't get a smell of <b>'em</b> <b>when</b> I was out looking 'em up," [...] Benson said, shaking his head dubiously.|$|R
2500|$|His first {{published}} song was [...] "When You Want 'Em, You Can't Get <b>'Em,</b> <b>When</b> You've Got <b>'Em,</b> You Don't Want 'Em" [...] in 1916 when Gershwin was only 17 years old. It earned him 50 cents.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I {{told you}} so,’ said Wisbottle, {{in a most}} knowing whisper. ‘Lord bless you, he has paid her most {{extraordinary}} attention {{for the last two}} months. I saw <b>’em</b> <b>when</b> I was sitting at the piano to-night.’ ...|$|R
