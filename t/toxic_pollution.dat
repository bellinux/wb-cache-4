40|$|Despite {{the actual}} and {{potential}} effects of <b>toxic</b> substance <b>pollution</b> upon human health, the United States Congress has never enacted a comprehensive victim compensation system. The {{approach of the}} Congress, to date, has been limited by a concern about legislating on a topic fraught with scientific uncertainty [...] the actual causation of injury or death by <b>toxic</b> substance <b>pollution</b> Individuals who believe they have been injured by toxic substances often bring their claims in state courts, where they face {{the difficult task of}} proving causation. Industry is principally concerned with the high cost of a compensation system, not the public health issue of scientific causation. From a policy standpoint, legislation is needed that produces information and standards on causation which assist both victims and industry. Congress has the opportunity to craft legislation that will deal rationally with an epic problem. To do so, however, the Congress must recognize scientific uncertainty as an omnipresent element of causation in cases of <b>toxic</b> substance <b>pollution.</b> This starting point, a comprehensive system of compensating victims of <b>toxic</b> substance <b>pollution,</b> can be drafted to address the values of data collection, data interpretation, prevention, conservation of economic resources, and fairness. <b>toxic</b> substance <b>pollution</b> victim compensation causation law and legislation...|$|R

2500|$|There are {{a variety}} of causes that can {{contribute}} directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species. [...] "Just as each species is unique", write Beverly and Stephen C. Stearns, [...] "so is each extinction... the causes for each are varied—some subtle and complex, others obvious and simple". Most simply, any species that cannot survive and reproduce in its environment and cannot move to a new environment where it can do so, dies out and becomes extinct. Extinction of a species may come suddenly when an otherwise healthy species is wiped out completely, as when <b>toxic</b> <b>pollution</b> renders its entire habitat unliveable; or may occur gradually over thousands or millions of years, such as when a species gradually loses out in competition for food to better adapted competitors. Extinction may occur a long time after the events that set it in motion, a phenomenon known as extinction debt.|$|E
