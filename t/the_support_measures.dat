40|$|Abstract. Various process {{modeling}} formalisms have been leveraged to specify service compositions. For assessing the expressiveness of similar languages and for providing best practice knowledge, patterns have fre-quently been proposed. However, the pattern catalogs proposed do not all share and document the criteria {{that were used}} for assessing pattern <b>support.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> scaling of <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> frequently is very coarse, only providing a basic level of selectivity. This paper proposes an approach that allows for <b>measuring</b> <b>the</b> pattern <b>support</b> for different catalogs in a uniform manner. The selectivity of <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> is improved by using the edit distance for calculating its degree. The feasibility of the approach is shown by preliminary results of the analysis of selected patterns and orchestration languages...|$|R

40|$|At {{present the}} most common {{measures}} for assessing stage acoustic conditions on concert hall stages are <b>the</b> <b>Support</b> <b>measures</b> - STearly and STlate. These measures are based on monophonic omnidirectional responses obtained at 1 m from the sound source, on a stage without a full symphony orchestra (or similar group of people) present. Both objective and subjective studies have been conducted, the latter using questionnaires with several orchestras and dialogue with musicians. Objective studies involved measurements on real stages of <b>the</b> <b>Support</b> <b>measures</b> and other acoustic measures such as T, EDT, C 80, G 7 - 50, Ge (G 0 - 80) and Gl(G 80 -∞) {{as well as a}} set of proposed architectural measures.

40|$|Abstract. The normal cycle TK {{associated}} with a convex body K ⊂ Rn is a current which in principle contains complete information about K. It is known that if a sequence of convex bodies Ki, i ∈ N, converges to a convex body K in the Hausdorff metric, then the associated normal cycles TK converge to i TK in the dual flat seminorm. We give a quantitative improvement of this convergence result by providing {{an estimate of the}} distance (in the dual flat seminorm) of the normal cycles of convex bodies with given Hausdorff distance. <b>The</b> <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> of a convex body K arise from a local Steiner formula or, alternatively, by evaluating suitable differential forms at the normal cycle of K. Complementing the estimate for the normal cycles, we establish an upper bound for the distance (in the bounded Lipschitz metric) of <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> of two convex bodies in terms of the Hausdorff distance of these bodies. A special case of these estimates yields reverse forms of known stability results for area measures. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Correlated motif mining (CMM) is {{the problem}} to find overrepresented pairs of patterns, called motif pairs, in {{interacting}} protein sequences. Algorithmic solutions for CMM thereby provide a computational method for predicting binding sites for protein interaction. In this paper, we adopt a motif-driven approach where <b>the</b> <b>support</b> of candidate motif pairs is evaluated in the network. We experimentally establish the superiority of <b>the</b> Chi-square-based <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> over other <b>support</b> <b>measures.</b> Furthermore, we obtain that CMM is an NP-hard problem for a large class of <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> (including Chi-square) and reformulate the search for correlated motifs as a combinatorial optimization problem.

Defining such a graph measure is a non-trivial task since many natural definitions in the graph transaction setting are non-monotonic in the single-graph setting. Many pattern mining algorithms, however, rely critically on the monotonicity of the support measure for efficient exploration of the search space. Besides imposing a computational burden, a non-monotonic measure also leads to nonintuitive situations where a sub-pattern seemingly occurs less frequently than a larger super-pattern. In our overview, we divide <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> into two classes: those based on the overlap-graph of the pattern, and the others. status: publishe...|$|E

In the study we have used the theoretical concept of empowerment as an analysis tool. The different kinds of <b>support</b> <b>the</b> students with disabilities were using were in common described as positive and the students thought that <b>the</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>measures</b> helped them getting more independent. Certain problems appeared such as accessibility problems to rooms at the university. The students regarded this as a complication on their way to get independent. The result of the study also indicates some lack of understanding amongst the teachers, which has led to maladjusted teaching to them. Our conclusion is that the students with disabilities regards mainly positive at their study situation, but some domains need improvement if the situation should be experienced as equal to other students...|$|R
