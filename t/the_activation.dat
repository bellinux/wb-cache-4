5|$|The initial Windows {{release was}} criticized by players for several {{perceived}} shortcomings. The game was shipped with SecuROM copy protection that required activation from 2K Games' servers over the Internet; the unavailability of these servers was reported {{as the reason}} for the cancellation of the game's midnight release in Australia. Players found that the SecuROM limited the number of times the game could be activated to two; user feedback led to 2K Games to increase <b>the</b> <b>activation</b> count to five, and later offer a tool that allowed users to revoke previous activations on their own. Ultimately 2K Games removed <b>the</b> <b>activation</b> limit, though retail versions of the game still required <b>the</b> <b>activation</b> process. Levine admitted that their initial approach to <b>the</b> <b>activation</b> process was malformed, harming their reputation during the launch period.|$|E

40|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} demonstrating age-related {{differences in the}} acceptability of foods and beverages. To examine the neural foundations underlying these age-related differences in the acceptability of different flavors and foods, we performed an fMRI study to investigate brain and hedonic responses to orange juice, orange soda, and vegetable juice in three different age groups: Young (22), Middle (40) and Elderly (60 years). Orange juice and orange soda {{were found to be}} liked by all age groups, while vegetable juice was disliked by the Young, but liked by the Elderly. In the insular primary taste cortex, <b>the</b> <b>activations</b> to these stimuli were similar in the 3 age groups, indicating that the differences in liking for these stimuli between the 3 groups were not represented in this first stage of cortical taste processing. In the agranular insula (anterior to the insular primary taste cortex) where flavor is represented, <b>the</b> <b>activations</b> to <b>the</b> stimuli were similar in the Elderly, but in <b>the</b> Young <b>the</b> <b>activations</b> were larger to the vegetable juice than to the orange drinks; and <b>the</b> <b>activations</b> here were correlated with the unpleasantness of the stimuli. In the anterior midcingulate cortex, investigated as a site where <b>the</b> <b>activations</b> were correlated with the unpleasantness of the stimuli, there was again a greater <b>activation</b> to <b>the</b> vegetable than to the orange stimuli in the Young but not in the Elderly. In the amygdala (and orbitofrontal cortex), investigated as sites where <b>the</b> <b>activations</b> were correlated with the pleasantness of the stimuli, there was a smaller <b>activation</b> to <b>the</b> vegetable than to the orange stimuli in the Young but not in the Elderly. The Middle group was intermediate with respect to the separation of their <b>activations</b> to <b>the</b> stimuli in the brain areas that represent the pleasantness or unpleasantness of flavors. Thus age differences in <b>the</b> <b>activations</b> to different flavors can in some brain areas be related to, and probably cause, the differences in pleasantness of foods as they differ for people of different ages.

Methods: Open-source solutions for solving the field equation in volume conductor models of deep brain stimulation and computing <b>the</b> neural <b>activation</b> are embedded into a Python package to estimate <b>the</b> neural <b>activation</b> dependent on <b>the</b> dielectric tissue properties and axon parameters by employing a spatially adaptive scheme. Feasibility of the approximation of <b>the</b> neural <b>activation</b> extent by field thresholds is investigated to further reduce the computational expense. Results: The varying extents of neural activation for different patient-specific dielectric properties were estimated with the adaptive scheme. The results revealed the strong influence of the dielectric properties of the encapsulation layer in the acute and chronic phase after surgery. The computational time required to determine <b>the</b> neural <b>activation</b> extent in each studied model case was substantially reduced. Conclusion: <b>The</b> neural <b>activation</b> extent is altered by patient-specific parameters. Threshold values of the electric potential and electric field norm facilitate a computationally efficient method to estimate <b>the</b> neural <b>activation</b> extent. Significance: <b>The</b> presented adaptive scheme is able to robustly determine neural activation extents and field threshold estimates for varying dielectric tissue properties and axon diameters while reducing substantially the computational expense.

40|$|Normalization {{techniques}} {{have only recently}} begun to be exploited in supervised learning tasks. Batch normalization exploits mini-batch statistics to normalize <b>the</b> <b>activations.</b> This was shown to speed up training and result in better models. However its success has been very limited when dealing with recurrent neural networks. On the other hand, layer normalization normalizes <b>the</b> <b>activations</b> across all activities within a layer. This was shown to work well in the recurrent setting. In this {{paper we propose a}} unified view of normalization techniques, as forms of divisive normalization, which includes layer and batch normalization as special cases. Our second contribution is the finding that a small modification to these normalization schemes, in conjunction with a sparse regularizer on <b>the</b> <b>activations,</b> leads to significant benefits over standard normalization techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified divisive normalization framework in the context of convolutional neural nets and recurrent neural networks, showing improvements over baselines in image classification, language modeling as well as super-resolution.
