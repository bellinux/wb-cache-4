As a particular example, in this article, we will focus on the exponentially distributed busy and idle periods (as in [3, 7, 10, 14]), which will allow us to obtain several main formulas such as the TDP in this section and the interference ratio and the achievable throughput for secondary users in the next section.

3000|$|In {{order to}} make an optimal channel {{assignment}} for the fixed receiving interface, each ad hoc node senses periodically a radio spectrum on both interfaces and estimates PN traffic workloads. Based on the sensed information, it selects a channel that is less occupied by external traffic caused by PNs for the fixed receiving interface. For spectrum sensing, it periodically samples the energy level on given bands. By following radio resource measurements (e.g., 802.11 k) based on channel occupancy and/or interference [18], an ad hoc node can then estimate PN traffic workload on each channel. In a similar way as the mesh network case [9, 10], such PN traffic can be captured by a semi-Markov model with two states, that is, a busy state and an idle state. Idle time, <b>Tidle,</b> and busy duration, Tbusy, have cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of two exponential random variables with rate λ and μ, respectively, given by P[Tidle≤t] = 1 -e-λ t and P[Tbusy≤t] = 1 -e-μ t. The PN traffic workload ([...] [...]...|$|E
40|$|The PCT 2075 is a temperature-to-digital {{converter}} featuring � 1 �C accuracy over � 25 �C to + 100 �C range. It uses an on-chip {{band gap}} temperature sensor and Sigma-Delta A-to-D conversion technique with an overtemperature detection output {{that is a}} drop-in replacement for other LM 75 series thermal sensors. The device contains a number of data registers: Configuration register (Conf) to store the device settings such as device operation mode, OS operation mode, OS polarity and OS fault queue; temperature register (Temp) to store the digital temp reading, set-point registers (Tos and Thyst) to store programmable overtemperature shutdown and hysteresis limits, and programmable temperature sensor sampling time <b>Tidle,</b> that can be communicated by a controller via the 2 -wire serial I 2 C-bus Fast-mode Plus interface. The PCT 2075 also includes an open-drain output (OS) which becomes active when the temperature exceeds the programmed limits. The OS output operates in either of two selectable modes: OS comparator mode or OS interrupt mode. Its active state can be selected as either HIGH or LOW. The fault queue that defines the number of consecutive faults in order to activate the OS output is programmable {{as well as the}} set-point limits...|$|E

The error {{is due to the fact}} that we reckoned without taking into account the energy consumed by the sensors on the robot. Please see the corrections below. Page 85 – 86 (1) In column 2, the last paragraph should read: (c) The cost that the robot will pay for passing each segment includes two parts: energy consumption ce and the influence of vibration on the robot body cb that describes the probability of the robot's equipment failure. Actually, ce includes two parts, the part that the sensors on the robot will consume, and secondly, the energy used for driving the motor. Here, we use cs to describe the first part and use ĉe to describe the second part. Therefore, (1) ce=c^e+cs Then the cost C can be described as (2) C=(ce,cb) Page 86 (1) In column 2, the chapter title “ 4. 2. 1 Mathematical Model of ce “ should read: “ 4. 2. 1 Mathematical Model of ĉe”. (2) In column 2, the paragraphs after Equation (9) and before Equation (11), all ce should be replaced by ĉe.

The value of rs is always stable, so for any road segment, for passing distance pml, we have the energy consumption (6) cs=rspml (2) In column 2, chapter title “ 4. 2. 3 Computing the Idle Time” should be replaced by “ 4. 2. 4 Computing the Idle Time”. Page 89 (1) In column 1, after the first paragraph in chapter 5. 1, the following should be added: (a) [*]rs Here, we do not measure rs directly, on the contrary, we first measure the consumption rate for unit time, which can be termed τs (unit: V/ s). If Vstart (unit: V) is the voltage value when the robot is just powered on, and after a period of time t, the value decreases to Vend (unit: V), we get (7) τs=Vstart−Vendt We assume that the robot walking for distance pml at average speed v̄ (unit: m/s), then (8) rs=τsv̄ In our experiment, we set Vstart = 12. 7 V, Vend = 11. 3 V, v̄ = 0. 75 m/s, then it is measured that t = 4. 5 h, therefore, rs is measure to be (9) rs= 12. 7 V− 11. 3 V 0. 75 m/s× 4. 5 h× 3600 s/h≈ 0. 1152 V/m (2) Equation (38) should be (10) re=Vstart−Vendv̄t̄−rs (3) Equation (39) should be (11) re_μf= 12. 7 V− 11. 3 V 0. 75 m/s× 2. 67 h× 3600 s/h− 0. 1152 × 10 − 3 V/m[*][*][*][*][*]≈ 0. 0790 × 10 − 3 V/m (4) Equation (40) should be (12) re_μr= 12. 7 V− 11. 3 V 0. 75 m/s× 2. 07 h× 3600 s/h− 0. 1152 × 10 − 3 V/m[*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*]≈ 0. 1353 × 10 − 3 V/m (5) Equation (41) should be (13) μr=re_μrre_μfμf= 0. 1353 × 10 − 30. 0790 × 10 − 3 μf≈ 1. 7127 μf (6) Equation (42) should be (14) re_μfφg≈ 0. 2034  × 10 − 3 V/m− 0. 1152  × 10 − 3 V/m[*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*]= 0. 0882 × 10 − 3 V/m Page 90 (1) Equation (45) should be (15) η=rb_μrμfrb_μfμr= 0. 5698 × 10 − 50. 2645 × 10 − 5 × 1. 7127 ≈ 1. 2578 (2) In the penultimate paragraph of column 2, the following corrections should be made: As listed in Table 2, the cost CRD 0 n is (0. 0520, 0. 8693 × 10 − 3) and the idle time TIDLE_ RD 0 is 346. 834 s.
