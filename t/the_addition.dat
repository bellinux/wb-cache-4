40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The authorship of <b>the</b> five <b>additions</b> to Thomas Kyd’s The Spanish Tragedy {{remains a}} conundrum. Ben Jonson was first thought responsible, but a {{majority}} of scholars argue against his involvement. Other candidates have been proposed, namely Thomas Dekker, Thomas Heywood, William Shakespeare, and John Webster. Past attribution studies have mainly focused on Shakespeare due to <b>the</b> fourth <b>addition,</b> <b>the</b> Painter’s Scene, which has been perceived to exhibit Shakespearean quality. John Nance’s lexical study of <b>the</b> fourth <b>addition</b> makes a most compelling case: Shakespeare’s hand is almost certainly present. Warren Stevenson, Hugh Craig, Brian Vickers, and Douglas Bruster have also supported an attribution to Shakespeare; however, their research errs in assuming a single author wrote all five of <b>the</b> <b>additions.</b> This assumption is disproven by Gary Taylor’s work on <b>the</b> first <b>addition,</b> which is <b>the</b> first to identify Heywood, not Shakespeare, as its likely author. Taylor’s conclusion emphasizes that <b>the</b> <b>additions</b> could embody revisions {{by more than one}} playwright, such {{as in the case of}} Sir Thomas More. Therefore, the authorship of <b>the</b> other <b>additions</b> must remain conjectural until further study. My thesis is the first to independently explore the third addition’s authorship, and based on lexical evidence, the following analysis disproves claims of Shakespeare’s presence within <b>the</b> third <b>addition...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Spanish Tragedy: {{although}} definitely {{known to}} be by Thomas Kyd, Thomas Pavier's edition of 1602 added five new passages to the preexisting text, totaling 320 lines, with <b>the</b> most substantial <b>addition</b> being an entire scene, known as the [...] "painter scene", since it is dominated by Hieronimo's conversation with a painter.
