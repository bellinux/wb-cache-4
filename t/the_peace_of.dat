5|$|After his {{quarrel with}} the Royalist court in exile, Rupert {{travelled}} to Heidelberg {{to visit his}} brother Charles Louis, now partially restored as Elector Palatine, where the two had an ambivalent reunion. Charles Louis and Rupert had not been friendly as children and had almost ended up on opposite sides during the Civil War. To make matters worse, Charles Louis had been deprived of half the old Palatinate under <b>the</b> <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Westphalia, leaving him badly short of money, although he still remained responsible under the Imperial laws of apanage for providing for his younger brother and had offered the sum of £375 per annum, which Rupert had accepted. Rupert travelled on to Vienna, where he attempted to claim the £15,000 compensation allocated to him under <b>the</b> <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Westphalia from the Emperor. Emperor Ferdinand III warmly welcomed him, {{but was unable to}} pay such a sum immediately—instead, he would have to pay in installments, to the disadvantage of Rupert.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{the forces}} of the Swedish Empire {{dominated}} Northern Germany, and along with her ally France, Sweden became guarantee power of <b>the</b> <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Westphalia in 1648. The Swedish aim of controlling the Baltic Sea by establishing dominions on the coastline ("dominium maris baltici") thwarted Frederick William's ambitions to gain control over the Oder estuary with Stettin (now Szczecin) in Pomerania.|$|E
5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Westphalia, {{which ended}} the Thirty Years' War in 1648, Brandenburg gained Minden and Halberstadt, also the {{succession}} in Farther Pomerania (incorporated in 1653) and the Duchy of Magdeburg (incorporated in 1680). With the Treaty of Bromberg (1657), concluded during the Second Northern War, the electors were freed of Polish vassalage for the Duchy of Prussia and gained Lauenburg–Bütow and Draheim. The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679) expanded Brandenburgian Pomerania {{to the lower}} Oder.|$|E
5|$|Complicating {{the account}} of this period {{is the issue of}} <b>the</b> <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Callias, which {{allegedly}} ended hostilities between the Greeks and the Persians. The very existence of the treaty is hotly disputed, and its particulars and negotiation are ambiguous. Ernst Badian believes that a peace between Athens and Persia was first ratified in 463 BC (making the Athenian interventions in Egypt and Cyprus violations of the peace), and renegotiated {{at the conclusion of the}} campaign in Cyprus, taking force again by 449–448BC.|$|E

5|$|Gebhard's {{conversion}} and marriage {{was the first}} major test of the principle of ecclesiastical reservation established in <b>the</b> <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Augsburg, 1555. His loss of the Electorate strengthened the Catholic counter reformation in the northern German states, gave the Jesuits a stronghold in Cologne, and expanded the Wittelsbach family influence in imperial politics.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain {{had broken}} <b>the</b> <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Amiens by declaring war on France in May 1803. In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish {{agreement}} {{became the first}} step towards {{the creation of the}} Third Coalition. By April 1805, Britain had also signed an alliance with Russia. Austria had been defeated by France twice in recent memory and wanted revenge, so it joined the coalition a few months later.|$|E
5|$|In 1517, the Wittenberg monk Martin Luther publicised The Ninety-Five Theses, {{challenging}} the Roman Catholic Church and initiating the Protestant Reformation. In 1555, <b>the</b> <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Augsburg established Lutheranism as an acceptable alternative to Catholicism, but also decreed that {{the faith of}} the prince was to be the faith of his subjects, a principle called Cuius regio, eius religio. The agreement at Augsburg failed to address other religious creed: for example, the Reformed faith was still considered a heresy and the principle did not address the possible conversion of an ecclesiastic ruler, such as happened in Electorate of Cologne in 1583. From the Cologne War {{until the end of the}} Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands. The latter reduced the overall population of the German states by about 30 per cent, and in some places, up to 80 per cent. <b>The</b> <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Westphalia ended religious warfare among the German states. German rulers were able to choose either Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism or the Reformed faith as their official religion after 1648.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Grunwald, First Battle of Tannenberg or Battle of Žalgiris, {{was fought}} on 15 July 1410 during the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War. The {{alliance}} of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, led respectively by King Władysław II Jagiełło (Jogaila) and Grand Duke Vytautas, decisively defeated the German–Prussian Teutonic Knights, led by Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen. Most of the Teutonic Knights' leadership {{were killed or}} taken prisoner. Although defeated, the Teutonic Knights withstood the siege of their fortress in Marienburg (Malbork) and suffered minimal territorial losses at <b>the</b> <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Thorn (1411) (Toruń), with other territorial disputes continuing until <b>the</b> <b>Peace</b> <b>of</b> Melno in 1422. The knights, however, would never recover their former power, and the financial burden of war reparations caused internal conflicts and an economic downturn in the lands under their control. The battle shifted {{the balance of power}} in Central and Eastern Europe and marked the rise of the Polish–Lithuanian union as the dominant political and military force in the region.|$|E
5|$|The Danish {{province}} of Øsel was ceded to Sweden under the 1645 Treaty of Brömsebro, which ended the Torstenson War, one theatre of the Thirty Years' War.

The situation remained unchanged until 1710 when Estonia and Livonia capitulated to Russia during the Great Northern War, an action formalised in the Treaty of Nystad (1721).|$|E
5|$|The city {{authorities}} {{proceeded to}} punish severely {{the leaders of}} the Huttwil League. Bern did not accept the terms of <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>of</b> Melligen with its amnesty, claiming the treaty was invalid on its territory, and cracked down hard on the rural population. The peasants were fined large sums and were made to cover the expenses for the military operations. <b>The</b> <b>peace</b> <b>of</b> the Murifeld was declared null and void by the Bernese city council, as was the Huttwil League. The rural population was disarmed. Many of the exponents of the movement were incarcerated, tortured, and finally sentenced to death or to hard labour on galleys, or exiled. Christian Schybi was executed at Sursee on July 9, 1653. Niklaus Leuenberger was beheaded and quartered at Bern on September 6, 1653; his head was nailed at the gallows together with one of the four copies of the Bundesbrief of the Huttwil League. Punishment was hardest in the canton of Bern, where 23 death sentences were handed down and numerous other prominent peasants were executed in courts-martial by von Erlach's army, compared to eight and seven death sentences in Lucerne and Basel, respectively.|$|E
