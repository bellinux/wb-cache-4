5|$|In April 1885, the Cosmos Club {{considered}} {{purchasing the}} house from the Tayloe family. The influential club already owned most of the block north of the Tayloe House, and was expanding rapidly. It valued the home at $60,000 and the furnishings at an additional $5,000. The Cosmos Club declined to buy the home after an investigation found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> upgrading the Tayloe property for its use would be too costly.|$|E

5|$|In January 2013, the Internal Revenue Service ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> {{covering}} {{only the}} individual employee {{would be considered}} in determining whether the cost of coverage exceeded 9.5% of income. Family plans would not be considered even if the cost was above the 9.5% income threshold. This was estimated to leave 2–4 million Americans unable to afford family coverage under their employers’ plans and ineligible for subsidies.|$|E
5|$|Market {{research}} had revealed {{that many of}} Concorde's existing business customers had their tickets purchased by their employers and thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> a journey on Concorde was higher than it actually was; thus ticket prices were progressively raised to match these perceptions. It is reported that British Airways then ran Concorde at a profit, unlike their French counterpart.|$|E
5|$|Between 1769 and 1773, Bellman wrote 65 of 82 of his Epistles, {{as well as}} many poems. He {{attempted}} to publish the poems in 1772, but was unable to obtain the permission of the king, Gustav III, as a political coup intervened. He finally managed to obtain the permission in 1774, but soon discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> printing, especially as he was determined to publish the sheet music alongside the text, was prohibitive given his ruinous finances, and he was forced to put off his plans. In 1776 the king gave him a sinecure job as secretary to the national lottery; this supported him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Keli {{struck the}} islands of Tuvalu on June 12 and 13, with {{extensive}} damage reported throughout the Islands with trees uprooted by wind and waves. On Nivalakita, all buildings except for the church were flattened; an estimated cost to rebuild all of the houses as they were before the cyclone hit was estimated at A$ (US$), while it was estimated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> rebuilding the houses with an improved, cyclone-resistant design would be about A$ (US$). The whole of Tepuka Savilivili was left uninhabitable, as coconut trees and other vegetation were swept away {{with no more than}} an area of jagged coral left behind. In Fiji, strong winds and rough seas were reported from the cyclone as it was moving to the north of Fiji, and while the cyclone was weakening it dropped 3.76inches (95.5mm) of rain on American Samoa.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{years of}} heavy promotion, the Deseret {{alphabet}} was never widely adopted. This reluctance was {{partly due to}} prohibitive costs; the project had already cost the early church $20,000, with $6,000 going to Pratt as remuneration for his transcription effort {{and most of the}} rest going to cutting metal type featuring the new alphabet and printing costs. In 1859, Parley P. Pratt estimated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> supplying all Utah Territory schoolchildren with suitable textbooks would cost over US$5,000,000.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s the Australian Government and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) {{considered}} options {{to replace the}} aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne, and her air group. While Melbourne had only been commissioned in 1955, the de Havilland Sea Venom fighters and Fairey Gannet maritime patrol aircraft operated by the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) were becoming obsolete. It was believed that Melbourne {{was too small to}} operate more modern aircraft types, and the RAN investigated options to buy a larger carrier. The Government judged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> a new aircraft carrier was too high, especially given the expense of the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force's (RAAF's) procurement programs at that time, and in November 1959 it was announced that the FAA would cease to operate fixed-wing aircraft in 1963.|$|E

5|$|In making {{preparations}} for filming, the producers found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> {{production in the}} New York City area would be prohibitive {{and it was also}} going to be difficult to find locations that resembled early 1950s New York. Part of the financing plan was hinging on a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led to a complete re-think. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, she found that it had not changed much in decades and the state of Ohio also had one of the best film tax incentives in the United States. The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many local citizens as crew.|$|E
5|$|Inexplicably, Generals Floyd and Pillow were upbeat {{about the}} day's {{performance}} and wired General Johnston at Nashville {{that they had}} won a great victory. Buckner, however, argued {{that they were in}} a desperate position that was getting worse with the arrival of Union reinforcements. At their final council of war in the Dover Hotel at 1:30a.m. on February 16, Buckner stated that if C.F. Smith attacked again, he could only hold for thirty minutes, and he estimated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> defending the fort would be as high as a seventy-five percent casualty rate. Buckner's position finally carried the meeting. Any large-scale escape would be difficult. Most of the river transports were currently transporting wounded men to Nashville and would not return in time to evacuate the command.|$|E
5|$|One major anomaly {{remained}} in the railway's operations: the 1889 Regulation of Railways Act had required, amongst other measures, that all British passenger trains be fitted with continuous brakes. McConnel had secured an exemption for the Talyllyn Railway, {{on the basis that}} the low speed of operation meant they were unnecessary and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> compliance would bankrupt the enterprise, {{but by the end of}} the 1990s the Railway Inspectorate was insisting that the Talyllyn be brought into compliance with the act, a little over 100years after it had passed. By 2001, the railway had fitted its entire passenger fleet with the necessary equipment, operated by air brake pumps mounted on the locomotives.|$|E

30|$|The results {{obtained}} {{in this study}} confirm those obtained by Sangwan et al. (2010): {{it can be said}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> agricultural production could be minimized with the use of vermicompost obtained from organic wastes.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{measures}} <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> business cycles {{by asking}} what proportion of consumption representative households, whose head is currently employed, {{would be prepared}} to give up to avoid the risk of unemployment. Previous estimates by Lucas suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> macroeconomic fluctuations measured in this way are surprisingly small. The first part of the paper presents a critique of the Lucas aggregate method showing that his estimates are not robust. An alternative disaggregated framework is then developed and shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> macroeconomic fluctuations are significantly higher than those obtained by Lucas. Consequently, <b>the</b> view <b>that</b> inflation 'matters' whereas business cycles are unimportant events is questioned. Copyright 1994 by Royal Economic Society. ...|$|R
5|$|Only {{three people}} were {{involved}} in the production of Daicon III, Hideaki Anno, Hiroyuki Yamaga and Takami Akai. Takeda, who {{was a part of the}} group, explains in Notenki Memoirs that Anno knew how to make anime, but he never worked with animation cels. They were referred to Animepolis Pero, an anime hobby store chain, but they found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the cels were too expensive, so a single cel was purchased and taken to a vinyl manufacturer in east Osaka, where they purchased a roll for 2000 yen. After cutting and preparing the vinyl cels, they discovered that the painted cels would stick together when stacked and dry paint would peel off the cels. To keep costs low, they made their own tap to punch holes in the B5 animation paper used in the production.|$|E
5|$|RML ordered Magdalena in 1946. Her keel {{had been}} laid by 8 October when Harland and Wolff applied for a {{passenger}} certificate for the ship. In 1947 {{it was reported that}} delivery would be delayed until the end of 1948 and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> building her would be considerably higher than the estimated cost when the order was placed. She was built to replace , which had been sunk in 1940. Magdalena was the first passenger ship built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast {{after the end of the}} war and the third-largest being built in the United Kingdom at that time.|$|E
5|$|Several local {{businesses}} considered contributing {{money to the}} mountain's purchase. Such funding would be considered surplus, {{and would not be}} subject to referendum. Owners of businesses on Main Street expressed concern at the June1 town board meeting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> parking would increase if the property was purchased by a third party. One board member estimated that without paying rent, the town would recoup the cost of the property within 12 years. Ulster County Area Transit expressed a desire to route its buses through the property, creating a connection to the Mohonk Preserve. A nonprofit organization, the Joppenbergh Mountain Preservation Association, was created in June 2011 to raise funding to purchase the mountain, the parking lot, and Willow Kiln Park.|$|E
50|$|Borrowing is stated at amortised <b>cost</b> using <b>the</b> {{effective}} interest method.

5|$|The Liberals and PC party {{differed}} considerably on {{fiscal and}} tax policies. In his opening campaign speech at Massey Hall in Toronto, Diefenbaker contended that Canadians were overtaxed {{in the amount}} of $120 per family of four. Diefenbaker pledged to reduce taxes and castigated the Liberals for not reducing taxes despite the government surplus. St. Laurent also addressed tax policy in his opening speech, in Winnipeg. St. Laurent noted that since 1953, tax rates had declined, as had the national debt, and that Canada had a reputation as a good place for investments. The Prime Minister argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> campaign promises made by the Progressive Conservatives would inevitably drive up the tax rate. Diefenbaker also assailed tight-money monetary policies which kept interest rates high, complaining that they were hitting Atlantic and Western Canada hard.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of AIDS in the nation's blood supply and subsequent lack of response by blood bank leadership occurred {{as early as}} 1982, yet {{it was not until}} 1985, when AIDS antibody testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), that blood bank industry leaders acknowledged that HIV could be transmitted through blood transfusions. Shilts' coverage revealed the feeling among blood bank industry leaders that screening donors for hepatitis alone might offend the donors, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> screening all the blood donations provided across the country every year was too high to be feasible.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchases}} of the diaries continued throughout {{mid to late}} 1981: Gruner + Jahr gave Heidemann 345,000DMs on 29 July, and a further 220,000DMs a week later, which brought the total up to 1.81millionDMs {{since the start of}} the year. This sum had purchased 18 diaries for the company. Schulte-Hillen, the new managing director, signed an authorisation for a further million DMs for future purchases. Just over two weeks later he signed a further authorisation for 600,000DMs after Heidemann told him <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the diaries had now risen to 200,000DMs each; Heidemann also passed on the news that there were more than 27 diaries.|$|E
