50|$|During the spacewalk, several {{problems}} were encountered, {{the first of}} which was during installation of the SGANT. A slight gap was observed between the antenna dish and its mounting pole. The spacewalkers loosened the bolts and used a higher <b>torque</b> <b>setting,</b> which managed to close the gap to a smaller width. The launch locks were left on the SGANT to allow engineers on the ground to determine if the gap was acceptable, or if more troubleshooting would be needed. The second problem occurred during the installation of the SGANT, and was related to the Command and Control (CNC) computers. During installation, when Steve Bowen removed a cover from a connector, the prime CNC computer detected an error and shut down. The cap was a special cap which allowed the circuit for that connector to be closed, so when it was opened the sensor detected an error. The shut down of the CNC caused a 2-minute loss of communications. The safeing of the computer also stopped the Canadarm2 for a reconfiguration of the cameras being used during the spacewalk by both the robotic arm operators and observers on the ground.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to implement a computer game based motivation system for maximal strength testing on the Biodex System 3 Isokinetic Dynamometer. The prototype game {{has been designed to}} improve the peak torque produced in an isometric knee extensor strength test. An extensive analysis is performed on a <b>torque</b> data <b>set</b> from a previous study. The torque responses for five second long maximal voluntary contractions of the knee extensor are analyzed to understand torque response characteristics of different subjects. The parameters identifed in the data analysis are used in the implementation of the 'Shark and School of Fish' game. The behavior of the game for different torque responses is analyzed on a different <b>torque</b> data <b>set</b> from the previous study. The evaluation shows that the game rewards and motivates continuously over a repetition to reach the peak torque value. The evaluation also shows that the game rewards the user more if he overcomes a baseline torque value within the first second and then gradually increase the torque to reach peak torque...|$|R

40|$|This {{laboratory}} study assessed removability of endodontic alkaline cements and resin sealers using coronal cross-sectional slices of roots with single canals. Materials were labelled with 0. 1 % (w/w) sodium fluorescein prior to mixing so that confocal microscopy {{could be used}} to quantify material remaining on the walls of post spaces, to assess cleanliness. Roots of extracted teeth were prepared using rotary NiTi instruments then obturated using lateral condensation with gutta percha and epoxy resin sealers (AH-Plus™ or Zirmix™), or were filled by injecting mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) cement (GC Nex™ MTA or MTAmix™) or a hard-setting calcium hydroxide cement (Supercal™).

40|$|ABSTRACT Three phase {{induction}} motor has a weakness in controlling the speed which depends {{only on the}} input frequency, but this can be reduce with inverter technology. <b>Torque</b> <b>setting</b> on an {{induction motor}} with low ripple and transient response form and good steady state is the main criteria of this controller design. First, using a PI controller to obtain these parameters, but with certain conditions. Gain can’t be increased outside the limit, so needed more better response. With the Artificial Intelligent techniques, this deficiency can be reduced. Once technique is using fuzzy logic in design of the controller or with PI controller. Elements of Fuzzy and PI controller {{for each of the}} overall aim to solve problems that happen, such as during start motor, no load and load conition. This method using the input of voltage and current on the close loop for calculating the rotor parameters.

The final result which obtained from the model of fuzzy logic controllers and PI controllers are compared. It’s expected that with fuzzy logic and PI controller can improve and reduce the ripple in motor torque and stator currents. It’s also can simplfy the restrictions on the magnitude of the torque and current values in a specific range on some kind of disturbance.

40|$|This {{in vitro}} {{investigation}} compared {{the effect of}} using either gold or titanium retaining screws on preload in the dental implant- abutment complex. Inadequate preload can result in screw loosening, whilst fracture may occur if preload is excessive. These are the most commonly reported complications in implant-retained prostheses, and result in unscheduled, costly and time-consuming visits for {{the patient and the}} clinician. This study investigated changes in preload generation after repeated torque applications to gold and titanium screws. The test set-up consisted of an implant body, a cylindrical transmucosal abutment, and the test samples of gold and of titanium retaining screws. The implant bodies were anchored using a load cell, and the transmucosal abutments were attached using either gold or titanium retaining screws. A torque gauge was used to apply torque of 20 Ncm, 32 Ncm, and 40 Ncm to the retaining screws. The preloads generated in each screw type were compared at each <b>torque</b> <b>setting,</b> and after repeated tightening episodes. In addition, the effect of applying torque beyond the manufacturers’ recommendations was also examined. Gold retaining screws were found to achieve consistently higher preload values than titanium retaining screws. Preload values were not significantly different from the first to the tenth torque cycle. Titanium screws showed more consistent preload values, albeit lower than those of the gold screws. However due to possible galling of the internal thread of the implant body by titanium screws, gold screws remain the retaining screw of choice. Based on the findings of this study, gold retaining screws generate better preload than titanium. Torque beyond the manufacturers’ recommendations resulted in a more stable implant complex. However, further investigations, with torque applications repeated until screw breakage, are needed to advise on ideal maintenance protocols. [URL]...|$|E
30|$|However, a {{large scale}} {{integration}} of wind generation may bring inevitable concerns over the power system operation due to the variability of wind generation, especially the active power balance between the generation and demand. As a consequence, a high penetration of wind energy will definitely increase the difficulty in frequency control. In {{order to keep the}} system frequency within an acceptable range, several researches focused on the frequency stability of power system in the presence of high renewable energy penetration. Oudalov and Pascal used battery energy storage system (BESS) for frequency control [2, 3]. BESS can substantially reduce the frequency deviations caused by sudden supply/demand variations. However the cost of BESS is very high {{and it is difficult to}} bring profit by now. The impact of wind turbine on the system frequency stability in the UK was investigated by Pearmine [4].

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{aimed to}} develop an undemanding test for {{endurance}} capacity of the knee extensor muscles, which can also be applied to frail participants. We hypothesized 1) that the first objective indications for peripheral fatigue during incremental unilateral repetitive isometric knee extensor contractions {{could be used to}} assess a fatigue threshold (FT), 2) that torque at FT would depend on training status, and 3) that this torque could easily be sustained for 30 min. METHODS: Five trained and five untrained participants performed 5 -min bouts of 60 repetitive contractions (3 -s on and 2 -s off). <b>Torque,</b> <b>set</b> at 25 % maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), was increased by 5 % MVC in subsequent bouts. The highest torque for which rectified surface EMG remained stable during the bout was defined as the FT. On separate occasions, 30 -min bouts were performed at and above the FT to assess sustainable torque. Changes in gas exchange parameters, HR, and RPE were monitored to corroborate FT. RESULTS: At FT (RPE = 5. 7 ± 1. 7), torque was higher (P < 0. 05) in trained (41. 4 % ± 5. 8 % MVC) than in untrained participants (30. 5 % ± 1. 8 % MVC). Sustainable torque was ~ 4 % higher than (P < 0. 05) and significantly related to FT (...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the hypothesis that fatiguing exercises led to increased force fluctuations during submaximal isometric knee extensions and to decreased accuracy and steadiness in the time and frequency domains. Sixteen young adults (eight males, eight females) were tested, in a seated posture with 90 Â° knee flexion, to assess their ability to reproduce target extensor <b>torques</b> <b>set</b> at 15 per cent and 20 per cent of their maximum voluntary isometric contraction, {{both before and after}} fatiguing exercises. Normalized mean (NMAE) and peak (NPAE) of the absolute error were both used to quantify accuracy, whereas normalized standard deviation of the absolute error (NSAE) was used to quantify steadiness of the torque trials in the time domain. Mean and median power frequencies (MnPF, MdPF) and normalized peak power (NPkP) were used to assess the spectral structure of the torque signals. NMAE, NSAE and NPAE all showed excellent intra- as well as intersession reliabilities (intraclass correlation values greater than 0. 75 and low standard error of measurement values), demonstrating repeatability of the test set-up. NMAE, NSAE and NPAE increased significantly post-fatigue (greater than 42 %), together with a shift towards higher frequency (MnPF and MdPF) components, indicating that the set-up was sensitive enough to detect the decreased force accuracy and steadiness of the musculature after fatigue. Increased force variability in both the time and frequency domains could therefore explain decreased steadiness after fatigue...|$|R
