Fuchs gave Gold technical information in January 1945 that was acquired only after two years of experimentation at a cost of $400 million.

5|$|Ancient Chinese Buddhist {{accounts}} from the mula-sarvastivadin monastic order (or vinaya) present yet another account of saffron's arrival in India. According to legend, an arhat Indian Buddhist missionary {{by the name}} of Madhyântika (or Majjhantika) was sent to Kashmir in the 5th century BC. Upon his arrival he seemingly sowed the first Kashmiri saffron crop. From there, saffron use spread throughout the Indian subcontinent. In addition <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> foods, saffron stigmas were also soaked in water to yield a golden-yellow solution that was used as a fabric dye.|$|E

30|$|The {{empirical}} {{demonstration of the}} proposed model enabled to identify predictors that determine intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT <b>in</b> tourism. Social influence has {{significant impact on the}} study participants’ behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT <b>in</b> tourism. As social influence <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT <b>in</b> tourism increases, the behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it also increases. There is also strong positive association between perceived usefulness and behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT <b>in</b> the tourism. This shows that users are more interested to integrate ICT in their tourism activities when they think that such technologies will be helpful. The finding also showed significant positive relationship between perceived ease of use and behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT <b>in</b> tourism. That means tourism organizations are motivated <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICTs when such technologies are easy <b>to</b> <b>use</b> letting them <b>to</b> have more time for other activities. There was significant association between cost effectiveness and behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT <b>in</b> tourism. Cost-effective ICT facilities are more preferable by tourism organizations. Moreover, there is significant relationship between competitive advantage and behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT <b>in</b> tourism. This suggests that users’ behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT <b>in</b> tourism increases when they believe that the technology will improve their competitive advantages over their counter parts. Besides, the research illustrated significant association between facilitating conditions and behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT <b>in</b> tourism. Tourism organizations’ behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT increases when facilitating conditions such as users’ experience, resources, and background ICT skill increases.|$|R

5|$|In 1942, Wheeler {{recruited}} Way {{to work on}} the Manhattan Project at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago.
