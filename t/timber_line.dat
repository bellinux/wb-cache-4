2500|$|The latest {{sedimentation}} {{phase of}} the Sabana Formation, evidenced by the sites El Abra, Tibitó and Tequendama, was accompanied by the first confirmed human settlement in Colombia. Around 12,500 years BP, groups of hunter-gatherers [...] the rock shelters surrounding the retreating Lake Humboldt. The people of the area hunted the still extant Pleistocene species, and used their remains {{for the construction of}} primitive settlements, as bone tools and the skins as clothing. At this stage, the <b>timber</b> <b>line</b> was [...] lower than today.|$|E
2500|$|The reserve covers {{areas on}} each side of the border between Poland and Slovakia. There area {{contains}} a number of natural features such as a dwarf pine belt, alpine meadows, lakes and rocky peaks. The area consists of temperate broadleaf forests or woodlands made up of mixed beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest with fir (Abies alba) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus). Higher up in the mountains this transitions to forests of silver fir (Abies alba) and Carpathian spruce (Picea Abies) until the <b>timber</b> <b>line</b> (...) [...] Above the forest is the subalpine zone (...) with dwarf mountain pine (Pinetum mughi), Sorbus aucuparia and Betula carpatica. The alpine zone consists of grasses and low-growth herbaceous groundcover.|$|E

6000|$|... "I've {{no use for}} {{fooling around}} a schrund in the mist and we can't wait for daybreak," [...] Deering remarked. [...] "We must get back and make the <b>timber</b> <b>line</b> {{on the other side}} before we freeze." ...|$|E
60|$|So I {{just sat}} down and rested, letting the oxen feed {{throughout}} the hours {{of light on the}} rich grasses which grew upon the bottom-most slopes of the big mountain where we were camped by a stream, not more than a hundred yards above the <b>timber</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
60|$|The day after, we left {{at eight}} o'clock, and rode {{down to the}} main trail, and up that for five miles where we cut {{off to the left}} and climbed into the timber. The woods were fresh and dewy, dark and cool, {{and for a long time}} we climbed bench after bench where the grass and ferns and moss made a thick, deep cover. Farther up we got into fallen timber and made slow progress. At <b>timber</b> <b>line</b> we tied the horses and climbed up to the pass between two great {{mountain}} ramparts. Sheep tracks were in evidence, but not very fresh. Teague and I climbed on top and R.C., with Vern, went below just along the <b>timber</b> <b>line.</b> The climb on foot took all my strength, and many times I had to halt for breath. The air was cold. We stole along the rim and peered over. R.C. and Vern looked like very little men far below, and the dogs resembled mice.|$|E

60|$|The {{trail was}} a {{disappointment}} to me, not because it was long and crossed mountains, but because it ran through a barren, monotonous, silent, gloomy, and rainy country. It ceased to interest me. It had almost no wild animal life, which I love to hear and see. Its lakes and rivers were {{for the most part}} cold and sullen, and its forests sombre and depressing. The only pleasant places after leaving Hazleton were the high valleys above <b>timber</b> <b>line.</b> They were magnificent, although wet and marshy to traverse.|$|E
60|$|The {{whole country}} for {{miles and miles}} in every {{direction}} {{was a series of}} high open valleys almost entirely above <b>timber</b> <b>line.</b> These valleys formed the starting-points of innumerable small streams which fell away into the Iskoot on the left, the Stikeen on the north, the Skeena on the east and south. These valleys were covered with grass and moss intermingled, and vast tracts were flooded with water from four to eight inches deep, through which we were forced to slop hour after hour, and riding was practically impossible.|$|E
60|$|The trio peered out. It {{was not a}} heartening spectacle. A few water- soaked tents {{formed the}} miserable foreground, from which the {{streaming}} ground sloped to a foaming gorge. Down this ramped a mountain torrent. Here and there, dwarf spruce, rooting and grovelling in the shallow alluvium, marked {{the proximity of the}} <b>timber</b> <b>line.</b> Beyond, on the opposing slope, the vague outlines of a glacier loomed dead-white through the driving rain. Even as they looked, its massive front crumbled into the valley, on the breast of some subterranean vomit, and it lifted its hoarse thunder above the screeching voice of the storm. Involuntarily, Molly shrank back.|$|E

60|$|A dozen tents held grimly {{to their}} pegs {{on the extreme}} edge of the <b>timber</b> <b>line</b> at Happy Camp. Frona, weary with the day, went from tent to tent. Her wet skirts clung heavily to her tired limbs, while the wind buffeted her brutally about. Once, through a canvas wall, she heard a man apostrophizing gorgeously, and felt {{sure that it was}} Del Bishop. But a peep into the {{interior}} told a different tale; so she wandered fruitlessly on till she reached the last tent in the camp. She untied the flap and looked in. A spluttering candle showed the one occupant, a man, down on his knees and blowing lustily into the fire-box of a smoky Yukon stove.|$|E
60|$|He {{reached the}} settlement, and after waiting {{a few days}} sat one evening on the hotel veranda. Burned matches and cigar-ends lay about the dirty boards; {{the windows of the}} mean ship-lap house were guarded by fine wire net. The door had been removed, and a frame, filled in with gauze and held by a spring, slammed noisily when one went in or out. For all that, the hotel was full of dust and flies, and {{mosquitoes}} hummed about the hot rooms at night. The snow had melted below the <b>timber</b> <b>line</b> and a long trail of smoke floated across the somber forest. A fire was working through the trees and a smell of burning came down the valley.|$|E
60|$|From {{this high}} point {{we could see}} our friends, the Manchester boys, on the north slope two or three miles below us at <b>timber</b> <b>line.</b> Weak in the knees, cold and wet and hungry as we were, we {{determined}} to push down the trail over the snowfields, down to grass and water. Not much more than forty minutes later we came out upon a comparatively level spot of earth where grass was fairly good, and where the wind-twisted stunted pines grew in clumps large enough to furnish wood for our fires and a pole for our tent. The land was meshed with roaring rills of melting snow, and all around went on the incessant signalling of the marmots--the only cheerful sound in all the wide green land.|$|E

60|$|They were {{on their}} way in half an hour, {{struggling}} up the hillside under the pines until at last the trees grew smaller towards the <b>timber</b> <b>line.</b> Then they floundered painfully over what had been bare slopes of rock and was now a waste of snow, with a dazzling field of whiteness. between them and the blue. Up there the frost was biting, and the snow lay fine as flour, blowing in thin wisps from under the horse's hoofs, while the men's jean and deerhide were sprinkled with glittering particles. The wind dropped towards sundown, and when, climbing a great hill shoulder, they dipped again to the forest the snows flamed crimson, against a pitiless blueness, out of which there seemed to fall a devastating cold.|$|E
60|$|The months {{came and}} went, {{and back and}} forth they twisted through the uncharted vastness, where no men were and yet where men had been if the Lost Cabin were true. They went across divides in summer blizzards, shivered under the midnight sun on naked {{mountains}} between the <b>timber</b> <b>line</b> and the eternal snows, dropped into summer valleys amid swarming gnats and flies, and {{in the shadows of}} glaciers picked strawberries and flowers as ripe and fair as any the Southland could boast. In the fall of the year they penetrated a weird lake country, sad and silent, where wildfowl had been, but where then there was no life nor sign of life--only the blowing of chill winds, the forming of ice in sheltered places, and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a hard}} day's run, up the Canon, through Sheep Camp, {{past the}} Scales and the <b>timber</b> <b>line,</b> across glaciers and snowdrifts {{hundreds}} of feet deep, and over the great Chilcoot Divide, which stands between the salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely North. They made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the craters of extinct volcanoes, and late that night pulled into the huge camp {{at the head of}} Lake Bennett, where thousands of goldseekers were building boats against the break-up of the ice in the spring. Buck made his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just, but all too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his mates to the sled.|$|E

60|$|It {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{laborious}} days of all our hard journey. Hour after hour we climbed steadily up beside the roaring gray-white little stream, up toward the far-shining snowfields, which blazed back the sun like mirrors. The trees grew smaller, the river bed seemed to approach us until we slumped along in the running water. At last we burst out into the light above <b>timber</b> <b>line.</b> Around us porcupines galloped, and whistling marmots signalled with shrill vehemence. We were weak with fatigue and wet with icy water to the knees, but we pushed on doggedly until we came to a little mound of short, delicious green grass from which the snow had melted. On this we stopped to let the horses graze. The view was magnificent, and something wild and splendid came on the wind over the snowy peaks and smooth grassy mounds.|$|E
60|$|Each day {{we drove}} above <b>timber</b> <b>line,</b> and at noon {{were forced to}} rustle the dead dwarf pine for fire. The marshes were green and filled with {{exquisite}} flowers and mosses, little white and purple bells, some of them the most beautiful turquoise-green rising from tufts of verdure like mignonette. I observed also a sort of crocus and some cheery little buttercups. The ride would have been magnificent {{had it not been}} for the spongy, sloppy marsh through which our horses toiled. As it was, we felt a certain breadth and grandeur in it surpassing anything we had hitherto seen. Our three outfits with some score of horses went winding through the wide, green, treeless valleys with tinkle of bells and sharp cry of drivers. The trail was difficult to follow, because in the open ground each man before us had to take his own course, and there were few signs to mark the line the road-gang had taken.|$|E
60|$|Two miles beyond Crater Lake lay Happy Camp--so {{named because}} here was found the {{uppermost}} {{fringe of the}} <b>timber</b> <b>line,</b> where men might warm themselves by fire again. Scarcely could it be called timber, for it was a dwarf rock-spruce that never raised its loftiest branches higher than a foot above the moss, and that twisted and grovelled like a pig-vegetable under the moss. Here, on the trail leading into Happy Camp, in the first sunshine {{of half a dozen}} days, Old Tarwater rested his pack against a huge boulder and caught his breath. Around this boulder the trail passed, laden men toiling slowly forward and men with empty pack-straps limping rapidly back for fresh loads. Twice Old Tarwater essayed to rise and go on, and each time, warned by his shakiness, sank back to recover more strength. From around the boulder he heard voices in greeting, recognized Charles Crayton's voice, and realized that at last they had met up with Young Liverpool. Quickly, Charles plunged into business, and Tarwater heard with great distinctness every word of Charles' unflattering description of him and the proposition to give him passage to Dawson.|$|E
