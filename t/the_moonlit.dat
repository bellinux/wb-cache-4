On the night of 30/31 March 1944, when 795 bombers were sent to attack Nuremberg, he was very {{critical}} of the route chosen, warning his station commander that heavy losses could be expected. On <b>the</b> <b>moonlit</b> night, 95 bombers were lost, its heaviest losses of the entire war during a single raid.|$|E
25|$|In {{locations}} {{with little}} light pollution, <b>the</b> <b>moonlit</b> night sky is also blue, because moonlight is reflected sunlight, {{with a slightly}} lower color temperature due to the brownish color of the moon. <b>The</b> <b>moonlit</b> sky is not perceived as blue, however, because at low light levels human vision comes mainly from rod cells that do not produce any color perception (Purkinje effect).|$|E

The Spanish ships were repelled {{and then tried to}} pass Leicester and move onto the next ship Edward Bonaventure. They were again repelled with heavy fire from the English cannons. <b>The</b> <b>moonlit</b> exchange continued with the English ships standing their ground and repelling the Spanish until about 4 am, when a rainstorm interrupted the battle. The Spanish ceased fire and moved off to effect repairs, with the English doing the same and collecting the rest of the men onshore.|$|E

500|$|The album closes with a segue {{from the}} end of [...] "The Cinema Show" [...] into [...] "Aisle of Plenty", a reprise of [...] "Dancing with <b>the</b> <b>Moonlit</b> Knight" [...] which gives the album a {{book-end}} effect.

The tone was described as [...] "boyish enthusiasm" [...] and [...] "highly condensed yet personable voice". [...] Gisèle Baxter, in the journal Canadian Literature, wrote that the its tone was set at the beginning of the book by [...] "an anecdote of a small boy creeping into <b>the</b> <b>moonlit,</b> partly wooded backyard of his family home".|$|E

500|$|... "Dancing with <b>the</b> <b>Moonlit</b> Knight" [...] {{evolved from}} a number of short piano pieces {{composed}} by Gabriel, which was combined with some of Hackett's guitar figures to make up the track. Gabriel added English-themed lyrics to counter the impression from the music press that Genesis were trying too hard to appeal to the American audience, including references to Green Shield Stamps. Banks had upgraded to a new model of Mellotron and used the choir sound on the track. The track ends with a series of 12 string guitar figures that were originally supposed to segue into [...] "The Cinema Show" [...] to make a piece around 20 minutes in length, but this idea was dropped as the result was too comparable to [...] "Supper's Ready".|$|E
500|$|After {{refuelling}} in Gibraltar, Illustrious and {{the battleship}} [...] were escorted into the Mediterranean by Force H {{as part of}} Operation Hats, during which her Fulmars shot down five Italian bombers and her AA guns shot down two more. Now escorted by {{the bulk of the}} Mediterranean Fleet, eight of her Swordfish, together with some from the carrier , attacked the Italian seaplane base at Rhodes on the morning of 3 September. A few days after the Italian invasion of Egypt, Illustrious flew off 15 Swordfish during <b>the</b> <b>moonlit</b> night of 16/17 September to attack the port of Benghazi. Aircraft from 819 Squadron laid six mines in the harbour entrance while those from 815 Squadron sank the destroyer [...] and two freighters totalling [...] The destroyer [...] later struck one of the mines and sank. During the return voyage to Alexandria, the [...] made an unsuccessful attack on the British ships. While escorting a convoy to Malta on 29 September, the carrier's Fulmars broke up attacks by Italian high-level and torpedo bombers, shooting down one for the loss of one fighter. While returning from another convoy escort mission, the Swordfish of Illustrious and Eagle attacked the Italian airfield on the island of Leros on the evening of 13/14 October.|$|E
500|$|With [...] "Love Sex Magic," [...] Ciara {{moved in}} a more pop {{direction}} than her past music. Jordan Sargent of PopMatters noted that while a pop fan might see the singer [...] "back in her mind creatively," [...] a Ciara fan would see the song as [...] "signal {{the end of the}} singer's career as it once was." [...] Sargent stated that the song [...] "sounds nothing like the chrome-plated crunk nor <b>the</b> <b>moonlit</b> balladry that Ciara has staked her name on." [...] Musically, the song is a dance-pop-R number which makes use of electro and funk music, as well as displaying disco and soul influences. The song has a minimalistic dance beat, with a [...] "funky, retro 70s style R guitar" [...] as the backdrop. Lauren Carter of the Boston Herald said that the song is influenced by Timberlake's disco-funk work on FutureSex/LoveSounds, stating that [...] "it sounds like a reworked version of his bass-heavy dance number [...] "Sexy Ladies." [...] Carter commented that Timberlake was [...] "ushering Ciara away from her typically crunk-laced stylings in favor of JT’s electro-slide." [...] Ann Powers of The Los Angeles Times said that the song was [...] "Madonna-esque." [...] Both Ciara and Timberlake provide verses, accompanied by vocal whims and falsetto.|$|E

2500|$|The Times wrote that, in the contralto roles, Leonard eschewed [...] "the more bizarre {{traits of}} these intimidating females {{in favour of}} a more {{balanced}} personification. As the domineering harridan Katisha [...] she convincingly demonstrated that the grotesque mask hid a fragile suffering woman. ... Her Queen of the Fairies [...] outwardly so full of composure, betrayed in tantalising moments the character's repressed sensuality." [...] Long-time musical director David Steadman wrote of her portrayals, [...] "we felt the despair of Ruth losing Frederic's attentions in Pirates, we could easily believe that her Buttercup adored Captain Corcoran in <b>the</b> <b>moonlit</b> stillness of Act Two of H.M.S. Pinafore, that Katisha was a woman with feelings ... and that the Fairy Queen was a monarch with a matronly love for her girls." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to historians, {{long before}} the prison opened on Alcatraz, early explorers to the island {{believed}} it to be haunted and it developed {{a reputation as a}} [...] "bad place". Western explorers visiting the island felt it had a disturbing atmosphere and spoke of <b>the</b> <b>moonlit</b> paths during the night. Bones and artifacts unearthed by archaeologists on the island have indicated that it might have served as a burial ground for Native American outcasts. Native Americans, known as Ohlone (A Miwok Indian word), were the earliest known inhabitants of the Alcatraz island. Even though they avoided the island as they believed that evil spirits resided there, they were using it for deporting their criminals under the tribal law to live on the island in isolation. They also gathered eggs of birds and marine food from the island. Even after the Spanish discovered the island in 1759, and started spreading Christianity, the natives {{who did not want to}} convert used the islands as their refuge.|$|E
5000|$|And in October 1899, [...] "An {{effort is}} being made to obtain lectures by various {{speakers}} on subjects of general interest on some of <b>the</b> coming <b>moonlit</b> evenings." [...] This {{is a reminder that}} winter events had to be planned around the phases of the moon.|$|R

2500|$|Genesis {{followed}} Nursery Cryme with Foxtrot (1972), {{which included}} Hackett's classical guitar solo [...] "Horizons", which {{became one of}} his signature pieces. The next album, Selling England by the Pound (1973), features Hackett continuing the tapping technique and sweep picking, which was later popularised in 1984 by Yngwie Malmsteen. Both techniques are used on [...] "Dancing with <b>the</b> <b>Moonlit</b> Knight". One of Hackett's best known guitar solos is performed on [...] "Firth of Fifth" [...] and has remained a favourite in concert, even after Hackett's departure. Hackett's role in the group was reduced from what he had contributed on Selling England by the Pound during the recording of The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974). He attributed this to {{not being able to}} come to grips with the material presented, and his failing marriage. Another factor was that Hackett had injured his left hand after he accidentally crushed a wine glass in his hand which severed a nerve and a tendon, causing the album's tour to be delayed and seven shows cancelled. This also reflected the tension within the band during this time as Gabriel was to leave the group at its conclusion.|$|E
