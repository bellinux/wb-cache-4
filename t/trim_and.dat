5|$|International: sedans and Sportwagons entered {{production}} in mid-March 2009. Internationals are appointed with launch VE Calais V alloy wheels, front foglamps, a six-disc CD changer, leather upholstered <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> steering wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist. Holden reintroduced the International in October 2009. Offered in sedan and Sportwagon body styles, the second iteration was fitted with the 3.0-litre SIDI V6 engine and six-speed automatic transmission; a 3.6-litre LPG Alloytec V6 engine with four-speed automatic transmission option {{was available for}} the sedan only. Extra features include 18-inch alloy wheels, Berlina front grille, leather seat <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> steering wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist for the sedan (already standard on Sportwagons).|$|E
5|$|Since 2003, EVA Air {{has adopted}} its current uniform, {{featuring}} dark green dresses with cropped jackets. Chief pursers are distinguished by orange highlights, gold bands, and orange stripes; flight attendants feature green <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> white stripes. The current uniform replaced the former green-and-orange necktie ensembles used in EVA Air's first twelve years.|$|E
5|$|The Simca Vedette {{is a large}} car, {{manufactured}} from 1954 to 1961 by the French automaker Simca, {{at their}} factory in Poissy, France. It was marketed with different model names according to <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> equipment levels. The Vedette was Simca's largest model {{at that time and}} it spawned a more economical version, the Simca Ariane.|$|E
50|$|The 2012-2013 home kit was {{the classic}} Zamalek home kit, which {{featured}} golden <b>trims</b> <b>and</b> two parallel horizontal red lines. The away kit was all pink with grey <b>trims,</b> <b>and</b> grey shorts.|$|R

5|$|The club's home strip {{remained}} unchanged {{from the previous}} season; a red jersey with white sleeves, shorts and socks. The new away kit, a retro yellow jersey with a blue collar <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> shorts, {{was based on the}} Arsenal strip worn in the 1979 FA Cup Final.|$|E
5|$|The primary uniform (jersey, {{shorts and}} socks) is red with {{alternating}} lighter and darker horizontal bands, black sleeves with red <b>trim,</b> <b>and</b> a vertical black band below each sleeve extending {{the full length}} of the jersey. The secondary uniform includes white jerseys with a large red horizontal band below a smaller blue band across the chest with blue and red trim, white socks with blue <b>trim,</b> <b>and</b> with either red or blue shorts (the choice of which is subject to the opponent uniform). In its first three seasons, Toronto FC's secondary uniform colours were light and dark grey. In the following four seasons the team wore white secondary uniforms, whereas in 2014, the secondary uniforms were changed to onyx. As with all MLS teams, the uniforms are produced by Adidas. In 2013 and 2014, a shadow-print maple leaf was featured on Toronto FC's primary jerseys.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} encountered {{during the}} aircraft's introduction was {{the occurrence of}} surging and stalling with the Avon engines. The F.2, which used the Armstrong-Siddeley Sapphire engine, did not suffer from this issue. Further problems occurred; ejected cannon ammunition links {{had a tendency to}} strike and damage the underside of the fuselage, and diverting the gas emitted by the cannon during firing was another necessary modification. The original split-flap airbrakes caused adverse changes in pitch <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> were quickly replaced by a single ventral airbrake. This meant, however, that the airbrake could not be used for landings.|$|E

5|$|Constructed in 1878, the Foster–Payne House is {{a two-story}} {{home with a}} {{low-pitched}} multi-gabled roof. The house has a single story open porch on the western side, a kitchen ell that projects from the rear and a single-story bay window that projects from the western bay of the front facade. The house is distinguished by its clapboard exterior and wooden trim under the gable peaks, the window <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> the porch brackets. There are three types of windows used on the house, single and paired one-over-one windows and two-over-two windows.|$|E
5|$|For the 2017–18 season, {{the home}} kit {{consists}} of a blue shirt with white trim at the neck and white stripes down the side seams, white shorts with blue <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> blue stripes down the side seams, and blue socks with white trim at the turnover. The away kit reverses the colours of the home kit. The kits are supplied by Adidas and bear the logo of online bookmaker 888sport, the club's main sponsor.|$|E
5|$|Greer's {{distinctive}} guitar-shaped scoreboard was {{manufactured by}} the Fairtron Corporation and installed by the Joslin Sign Company {{prior to the}} 1993 season {{at a cost of}} $400,000. It was originally conceived as the centerpiece for a proposed major league ballpark in Nashville sought after by owner Larry Schmittou {{as a part of the}} 1993 Major League Baseball expansion. It is painted black with red, yellow, and white <b>trim,</b> <b>and</b> is located behind the outfield wall in left-center field.|$|E

5|$|The Otis {{elevators}} are {{spanned by}} a series of neo-deco light bands extending wall to wall. The lobby extends completely through the block, with a giant entrance hall at Monroe Street and a 16-story full-height atrium in the link between the AT and USG towers (also designed by Smith) as both towers share a common appearance. The building boasts two public lobbies and a mezzanine-level lobby. The lobbies are among the most lavish in Chicago, and they are all decorated with patterned marble floors and walls, bronze, gold-leaf oak <b>trim,</b> <b>and</b> stylized lighting fixtures.|$|E
5|$|The bricks {{from which}} the house was built were fired in the {{immediate}} vicinity (along the banks of the South Branch Potomac River), and the brick walls were reinforced with hand-wrought structural iron angles. The nails used in its construction were fabricated by a local blacksmith, and the wooden sills and joists were sawn by hand. As of 2012, all the original windows, <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> building materials in the main section of the house were still present.|$|E
5|$|The {{carriage}} barn complex predates the Shepards' {{ownership of}} the property; it was built around 1875 as part of Wright's original estate. The most prominent component is the brick carriage house, which was designed by McKim, Mead & White. It is made of brick with granite <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> is {{one and a half}} stories high, ten bays wide and three bays deep. It has a steeply pitched slate hip roof with spring eaves and exposed rafters. At the roof's ridge sits an octagonal ventilating element with a bell-cast roof.|$|E

5|$|The {{elevator}} is {{also very}} narrow in chord like the rudder, and the B-52 suffers from limited elevator control authority. For long term pitch <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> airspeed changes the aircraft uses an all-moving tail with the elevator used for small adjustments within a stabilizer setting. The stabilizer is adjustable through 13 degrees of movement (nine up, four down) and is crucial to operations during {{take off and landing}} due to large pitch changes induced by flap application.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} contains three sandstone fireplaces, and the countertops {{are finished}} with hand-painted tiles from Mexico. Myrtlewood is used inside as <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> for doors. Bedroom closets were constructed with drawers, shelves, and ironing boards built-in. Inside the two-level building are amenities such as dumbwaiters and a sewing room. On the outside raked cedar was {{used on the}} eaves of the low-pitched roof-line building. The exterior sandstone is tan, rose, and blue in color.|$|E
5|$|Fire Station Number 4 or Fire Station No. 4 is a {{historic}} fire station located at 474 Broadway in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The building historically has also been called the Collyer Fire Station. The Queen Anne Style station was built in 1890. It is a -story, hip-roofed rectangular brick building with two brick wings and a bell tower. Constructed of red brick with sandstone <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> sandstone lintels and sills on the windows, the building has a foliate terracotta plaque bearing its name and date of construction. The fire station was closed as a firehouse in 1974, when the current Fire Station Number 4 on Cottage Street opened. The interior of the building was greatly modified to accommodate offices and meeting rooms {{by the time of}} its listing on the national register. In 2014, the building is being used by the Catholic Charities of Providence. Fire Station Number 4 was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E

5|$|Newer {{aircraft}} designs {{such as the}} McDonnell Douglas MD-11 {{have incorporated}} hydraulic fuses to isolate a punctured section and prevent a total loss of hydraulic fluid. Following the UAL 232 accident, such fuses were installed in the number 3 hydraulic system in the area below the number 2 engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure sufficient control capability remained if all three hydraulic system lines should be damaged in the tail area. Although elevator and rudder control would be lost, the aircrew would {{still be able to}} control the aircraft's pitch (up and down) with stabilizer <b>trim,</b> <b>and</b> would be able to control roll (left and right) with some of the aircraft's ailerons and spoilers. Although not an ideal situation, the system provides a greater measure of control than was available to the crew of United 232.|$|E
5|$|Strange {{arranged}} the Pro Tools session {{in a more}} traditional manner by laying out the drums, bass instruments, guitars, keyboards, main vocals and overdubs from left to right. While mixing, he began with drums, then the main vocals. He added the chorus and bridge, followed by other instrumentation. Strange mixed the track to satisfy Eminem, who, after entering the studio, made his own adjustments, providing additional production; by then, Resto's tracks were added. Strange made adjustments to Boi-1da's tracks, using SSL equalization (EQ) and some compression. To keep the track in tune from pitch fluctuation, Strange used <b>Trim</b> <b>and</b> Auto-Tune on Resto's TR-808 kick. Strange arranged reverberation tools, including the Bricasti, Eventide 2016, the Lexicon 480, Lexicon PMC70, and the Yamaha SPX90.|$|E
5|$|The {{house at}} Valley View is a two-story brick Greek Revival-style {{structure}} with a rectangular architectural plan. The front entrance {{is covered by}} a small portico, topped with a pediment supported by wooden Doric columns. The rear of the house, with a two-story (double) wood porch stretching across it, faces the South Branch Potomac River valley and Mill Creek Mountain. Each of the original eight large rooms of the 1855 structure contains a fireplace framed by a wooden trabeated mantelpiece with classical elements. The original windows, wooden <b>trim,</b> <b>and</b> materials in the main section of the house are intact. In 2012, Valley View was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its locally significant architecture.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{industrial}} revolution, all <b>trim</b> was made <b>and</b> applied by hand, thus making heavily <b>trimmed</b> furnishings <b>and</b> garments expensive <b>and</b> high-status. Machine-woven <b>trims</b> <b>and</b> sewing machines put these dense trimmings within {{the reach of}} even modest dressmakers and home sewers, and an abundance of trimming is a characteristic of mid-Victorian fashion. As a predictable reaction, high fashion came to emphasize exquisiteness of cut and construction over denseness of <b>trimming,</b> <b>and</b> applied <b>trim</b> became a signifier of mass-produced clothing by the 1930s. The iconic braid <b>and</b> gold button <b>trim</b> of the Chanel suit are a notable survival of trim in high fashion.|$|R
