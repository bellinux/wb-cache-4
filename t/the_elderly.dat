5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least {{and the risks}} are greatest in <b>the</b> <b>elderly.</b> <b>The</b> <b>elderly</b> are at {{an increased risk of}} dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and an increased risk of hip fractures. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> can resemble dementia, depression, or anxiety syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk incontinence, and a reduced risk of falls and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as great in <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> such as oxazepam and temazepam. The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as zaleplon and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E

About 12 million people, 34 % occurred in men and 60 % in women. Indonesia 32. 2 % in <b>the</b> <b>Elderlies</b> suffers urinary incontinence. The aims {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of Kegel Exercise toward urinary in continence on <b>the</b> <b>elderlies.</b> <b>The</b> design of this study is Quasy experiment with design of one group pretest-posttest. This research was conducted in January-August 2015. The population in this research was 110 Elderlies, based on inclusion criteria were 12 people taken by total sampling techniques. The Data was collected by using questionaire and checklist sheets. Data were analyzed by using univariate and bivariate statistical dependent T-test with Shapiro Wilk normality test. The result showed that the frequency of urinary incontinence in <b>the</b> <b>elderlies</b> before doing Kegel exercises had the average about 10. 58 with deviation 2, 065. Freqency of urinary incontinence in <b>the</b> <b>elderlies</b> after doing Kegel exercises had the average about 8. 00 with standard deviation 2, 796. After doing the statistical, there is the effect of urinary incontinence before and after doing Kegel exercises in <b>the</b> <b>elderlies.</b> Kegel exercises can reduce urinary incontinence. It can be applied as the daily activities at social institution every day. </p...|$|R

MethodsA total of 446 disabled elderly people were recruited and examined using the General Questionnaire and Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II. ResultsThe mean score of the health-promoting lifestyle was 109. 73 (SD =  16. 80), in which 90. 6 percent of <b>the</b> disabled <b>elderly</b> demonstrated unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. The average score for each of the subscales included the following: interpersonal relations, stress management, nutrition, self-actualization, health responsibility, and sports activity. ConclusionsThe health-promoting lifestyle of <b>the</b> disabled <b>elderly</b> needs to be improved; health care workers and the government should {{pay more attention to the}} countermeasures that can improve the lifestyle behaviors and promote the health of <b>the</b> disabled <b>elderly...</b>|$|R
5|$|Additional {{caution is}} {{required}} in <b>the</b> <b>elderly,</b> as they are {{more sensitive to the}} pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines, metabolise them more slowly, and are more prone to adverse effects, including drowsiness, amnesia (especially anterograde amnesia), ataxia, hangover effects, confusion, and falls.|$|E
