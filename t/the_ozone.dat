In 1985, three British scientists working on data they had gathered at Halley Station on the Brunt Ice Shelf discovered {{the existence of a}} hole in this layer. It was eventually determined that the destruction of <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> was caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) emitted by human products.

40|$|The Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) is {{utilised}} {{to study}} <b>the</b> daily <b>ozone</b> cycle and underlying photochemical and dynamical processes. The analysis {{is focused on}} <b>the</b> daily <b>ozone</b> cycle in <b>the</b> middle stratosphere at 5 hPa where satellite-based trend estimates of stratospheric ozone are most biased by diurnal sampling effects and drifting satellite orbits. <b>The</b> simulated <b>ozone</b> cycle shows a minimum after sunrise and a maximum in the late afternoon. Further, a seasonal variation of <b>the</b> daily <b>ozone</b> cycle in <b>the</b> stratosphere was found. Depending on season and latitude, the peak-to-valley difference of <b>the</b> daily <b>ozone</b> cycle varies mostly between 3 – 5 % (0. 4 ppmv) with respect to <b>the</b> midnight <b>ozone</b> volume mixing ratio. The maximal variation of 15 % (0. 8 ppmv) is found at the polar circle in summer. The global pattern {{of the strength of}} <b>the</b> daily <b>ozone</b> cycle is mainly governed by the solar zenith angle and the sunshine duration. In addition, we find synoptic scale variations in the strength of <b>the</b> daily <b>ozone</b> cycle. These variations are often anti-correlated to regional temperature anomalies and are due to the temperature dependence of the rate coefficients k 2 and k 3 of the Chapman cycle reactions. Further, the NO x catalytic cycle counteracts to <b>the</b> accumulation of <b>ozone</b> during daytime and leads to an anti-correlation between anomalies in NO x and the strength of <b>the</b> daily <b>ozone</b> cycle. Similarly, ozone recombines with atomic oxygen which leads to an anti-correlation between anomalies in <b>ozone</b> abundance and <b>the</b> strength of <b>the</b> daily <b>ozone</b> cycle. At higher latitudes, an increase of the westerly (easterly) wind cause a decrease (increase) in the sunshine duration of an air parcel leading to a weaker (stronger) daily ozone cycle...|$|R

5|$|The {{advent of}} {{photosynthesis}} in very basic forms of plant life worldwide allowed the sun's energy {{to be harvested}} to create conditions allowing for more complex life. The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted {{in the development of}} yet more complex cells called eukaryotes. Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms. With <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.|$|E
5|$|A {{supernova}} is a cataclysmic {{explosion of}} a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules cause a depletion of <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer that protects the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will {{have a significant impact on}} the planet's biosphere.|$|E
5|$|Poisonous {{bromomethane}} {{was widely}} used as pesticide to fumigate soil and to fumigate housing, by the tenting method. Ethylene bromide was similarly used. These volatile organobromine compounds are all now regulated as ozone depletion agents. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete <b>the</b> <b>Ozone</b> Layer scheduled the phase out for <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> depleting chemical by 2005, and organobromide pesticides {{are no longer}} used (in housing fumigation they {{have been replaced by}} such compounds as sulfuryl fluoride, which contain neither the chlorine or bromine organics which harm ozone). Before the Montreal protocol in 1991 (for example) an estimated 35,000 tonnes of the chemical were used to control nematodes, fungi, weeds and other soil-borne diseases.|$|E

30|$|We can, therefore, {{conclude}} {{that the use of}} an inaccurate SST in a tidally locked Earth-like exoplanet may significantly affect <b>the</b> secondary <b>ozone</b> layer, while <b>the</b> primary <b>ozone</b> layer remains almost unaffected.|$|R

5|$|The {{chlorine}} oxides are well-studied {{in spite of}} their instability (all of them are endothermic compounds). They are important because they are produced when chlorofluorocarbons undergo photolysis in the upper atmosphere and cause the destruction of <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer. None of them can be made from directly reacting the elements.|$|E
5|$|A near-Earth {{supernova}} is {{a supernova}} {{close enough to}} the Earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere. Depending upon the type and energy of the supernova, it could be as far as 3000light-years away. Gamma rays from a supernova would induce a chemical reaction in the upper atmosphere converting molecular nitrogen into nitrogen oxides, depleting <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer enough to expose the surface to harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. This has been proposed as the cause of the Ordovician–Silurian extinction, which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between {{the atmosphere}} and outer space.|$|E

5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation of <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. <b>The</b> <b>ozone</b> layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon {{is known as the}} greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} organisms, {{increasing}} ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion {{and other factors}} may harm the DNA of amphibians, particularly their eggs.

5|$|The Earth's {{magnetic}} field serves to deflect {{most of the}} solar wind, whose charged particles would otherwise strip away <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.

5|$|In 2006 {{there were}} {{believed}} to be 4,035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle. Of these, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status. A number of causes are believed to be involved, including habitat destruction and modification, over-exploitation, pollution, introduced species, climate change, endocrine-disrupting pollutants, destruction of <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer (ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin, eyes, and eggs of amphibians), and diseases like chytridiomycosis.

5|$|Other human {{impacts on}} the {{atmosphere}} include the air pollution in cities, the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer. Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming, the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.|$|E
