500|$|In May 1928, the KCA {{launched}} a Kikuyu-language magazine, Muĩgwithania (roughly translated as [...] "The Reconciler" [...] or [...] "The Unifier"), {{in which it}} published news, articles, and homilies. Its purpose was to help unify the Kikuyu and {{to raise funds for}} the KCA. Kenyatta, now described as Secretary of the KCA, was listed as the publication's editor, although Murray-Brown suggested that he was not the guiding hand behind it and that his duties were largely confined to translating things into Kikuyu. Kenyatta's approach to campaigning was cautious; he was aware that Thuku had been exiled for his activism. In Muĩgwithania, he expressed support for the churches, district commissioners, and chiefs. He also praised the British Empire, stating that: [...] "The first thing [...] is that all people are governed justly, big or small – equally. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> is that nobody is regarded as a slave, everyone is free to do what he or she likes without being hindered." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} moment when Nico Rosberg let him past {{in the early stages}} of the race, Hamilton told the press that he had thanked his {{teammate}} for [...] "being a gentleman". When asked how painful it had been to be asked to let Hamilton go by, Rosberg said: [...] "It was more painful the feeling that I had in the car. That was the worst. Around Monaco, that's not a nice feeling to have. I had no confidence at all. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> [...] was just a consequence of that." [...] Mercedes's motorsport director Toto Wolff also praised Rosberg for working for the team and moving to the side without questioning the team's decision. Rosberg was however unable to give an explanation for his slow pace during the early stages. He pointed to the possibility that his car's tyre and brake temperatures had been particularly affected by the period behind the safety car.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, {{the group}} {{received}} the MTV Legend award by MTV Russia. The {{group is the}} most successful Russian musical export of all time. Katina stated to Billboard Magazine; [...] "People will remember us for great songs, being free, taking life as it is and not being afraid of anything, [...] provocative images of two girls kissing each other, but <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> was the really great music." [...] In 2006, both Lena and Yulia were awarded [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] by GQ's Person of the Year Awards, but were not awarded under the band name.|$|E

60|$|Former and Latter. Indicating {{the first}} and <b>the</b> <b>second</b> of <b>things</b> {{previously}} named, these words are unobjectionable if not too {{far removed from the}} names that they stand for. If they are they confuse, for the reader has to look back to the names. Use them sparingly.|$|R
60|$|One {{thing was}} clear--the wheel {{must be removed}} from <b>the</b> block. A <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> was equally clear--while the wheel was being removed the car {{would have to be}} {{fastened}} to the cable by the rope he had brought.|$|R
2500|$|That {{was written}} {{around the time}} of the first record [...] I think that was <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> Ed and I wrote together. It came out of a jam in the studio and Ed didn't really have any lyrics. He came up with some ideas right there on the spot, and that's what we recorded. For some reason, it didn't make it on Ten. I was kind of bummed at the time. I really wanted it to be on our first record. But at the time, I was really young and just happy to be around this situation, so I did whatever.|$|E
2500|$|For Tilghman, Princeton has two {{essential}} missions. [...] "One is {{to ensure}} that our doors are open as wide as possible to every talented student in the world who is capable of doing the hard work we ask of them. [...] And that means maintaining our commitment to financial aid, which is the tool – the critical tool – to get those students to Princeton. [...] And <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> is that we must address the most critical issues, and push back the frontiers of knowledge, and not just in science and technology, but in social policy, and in public policy, and in understanding the nature of the human condition." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the legend}} of Ɓoxo-koƥ (dog of the forest or [...] "wild dog" [...] (figuritively) - jackal), the jackal was the first living thing created by the supreme deity Roog. The jackal circled {{the world in a}} day and two of its hands were {{transformed}} into paws. [...] The supreme being gave it the ngud tree (guiera senegalensis) and thus ngud became the first tree and <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> created by Roog. After the creation of ngud, the nalafun tree (combretum paniculatum) was created to whom the deity told: [...] "Go and keep the ngud tree company, it is lonely". During the life cycle of the nalafun, the tree grow so tall that it headed towards the sky. The supreme being considered that an affront and gave it a sharp flick on the head (mak in Serer) and told it: [...] "You are rude. Go! Turn around and go back to where you've just came from". After that event, the nalafun never grew tall as it once did and was always bent.|$|E
5000|$|... in the Invierno 99 season Irapuato faced Zacatepec in the Final, {{they beat}} them 3-1 {{in the first}} leg with goals from Cristián Ariel Morales, and Martín Rodríguez in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> leg <b>things</b> got {{complicated}} when Zacatepec tied the game but Morales and Rodriguez scored and they took the championship with an overall score of 5-3.|$|R
30|$|A shared view on envy {{is that it}} is a kind of {{negative}} emotion that surfaces when one lacks and desires others’ superior qualities, achievements, or possessions (Parrott & Smith, 1993). Extant literature has uncovered three prerequisites for being envied by others. First, the envied target has <b>the</b> better <b>things.</b> <b>Second,</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that one lacks are vital to his or her self-concept. Third, the envious person perceives that the target is similar to him or her to some extent. (Cohen-Charash & Mueller, 2007).|$|R
50|$|Each {{show has}} three rounds, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> {{involving}} finding <b>things</b> for the Map of Weird, {{and the third}} called the Random Word Round. Ironically, on the first show, the random word was 'word'.|$|R
2500|$|The Spice Girls {{were fully}} {{involved}} {{in the writing of}} all the songs. Halliwell in particular was clearly a fund of ideas for songs, arriving at sessions with her book of jottings, notes and miscellaneous scribblings which often produced the starting point of a lyric or a song title or just an agenda for the day's work. Watkins commented, [...] "Geri [...] would come up with the concept for a song. Typically, she'd sing one line and the girls would pick up on it or we'd pick up on it and construct around it and then Mel C [...] and Emma [...] would be very active. They'd really like to sit and sing melodies and go off and come up with little sections." [...] They [...] "conceptualised" [...] and sang bits of melody and wrote the lyrics. But in musical terms it was not a partnership of equals. Rowe commented: [...] "We had to kind of steer it. It was very different for different tracks really. Some of them were when we were all jamming in the room. We'd just put up some drum sounds and start making things up. On other tracks me and Richard [...] would prepare something beforehand and play it to them. We'd have some lyrics and make them write the second verse." [...] The Spice Girls introduced two key innovations that have had a lasting impact on the way which modern pop acts go about their creative business. Firstly they introduced the idea of songwriting identity. This was a familiar concept in rock bands like Queen or the Sex Pistols, but not in the world of [...] "manufactured pop", where the credits of songwriting would be divided out strictly in accordance with whoever had written the song. The Spice Girls recognised their solidarity as a group, which depended on maintaining parity in all departments, including the songwriting credits and the resulting royalties. They share the songwriting royalties on all the songs irrespective of what any member of the group had or had not contributed to any particular song. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> the Spice Girls established from the outset was a straight 50–50 split between them and their various songwriting collaborators. Here they anticipated one of the key developments in the pop industry since the 1990s, namely the increasing importance of publishing royalties as opposed to royalties payments made for the performance of the song on the record.|$|E

5000|$|A bookworm {{that has}} evolved in magical libraries. Because of the {{constant}} danger of running into a volume containing spells (which release thaumic radiation), the [...]303 caliber bookworm eats quickly. So quickly, in fact, {{that it has been}} known to ricochet off walls after boring through a shelf of books. It is <b>the</b> <b>second</b> fastest <b>thing</b> on <b>the</b> Disc (the fastest being Casanunda in a nunnery).|$|R
50|$|In their ninth {{consecutive}} {{season in}} <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> Division, <b>things</b> were looking bright for Dumbarton's league challenge, {{as at the}} turn of the year they were lying only a point behind a promotion place. However a run of 5 straight defeats in January 1931 snuffed out these hopes and in the end Dumbarton finished a midtable 10th out of 20, with 38 points - 23 behind champions Third Lanark.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} quarter, Arizona trailed early as Redskins RB Clinton Portis got a 2-yard TD {{run for the}} only score of the period. In <b>the</b> <b>second</b> quarter, <b>things</b> got worse for the Cards as Warner's second {{interception}} was returned by LB London Fletcher 27 yards for a touchdown. Arizona would finally respond as Warner threw a 2-yard TD pass to WR Anquan Boldin (with a failed PAT).|$|R
60|$|Second, I {{come now}} to <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing,</b> viz. the {{doctrine}} of the imputation of Christ's righteousness, which you thus expound.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his review}} of Powhida's 2009 {{exhibition}} The Writing Is on the Wall, Holland Cotter of the New York Times called Powhida an [...] "art world vigilante, virtuoso draftsman, compulsive calligrapher and fantasist autobiographer." [...] Art critic Jerry Saltz called Powhida <b>the</b> <b>second</b> best <b>thing</b> to happen in 2009 in his assessment of art in New York that year, praising his drawing for the Brooklyn Rail {{as well as his}} spring exhibition at Schroeder Romero.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> notable <b>thing</b> {{was that}} the {{right-hand}} groove, where first we saw it {{at the point of}} separation, was not polished like the left-hand groove, although at some time or other it seemed to have been subjected to the pressure of the same terrific weight which cut its fellow out of the bed of rock or iron, as the sharp wheels of a heavily laden wagon sink ruts into a roadway.|$|R

50|$|Trying to snap {{a three-game}} skid, the Raiders went {{home for a}} Week 9 intraconference duel with the Houston Texans. In the first quarter, Oakland's struggles {{continued}} as Texans RB Ahman Green got an 8-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In <b>the</b> <b>second</b> quarter, <b>things</b> continued to get worse the Raiders as Houston increased its lead with RB Ron Dayne getting a 14-yard TD run, while kicker Kris Brown nailed a 40-yard field goal.|$|R
50|$|The Institutes of Gaius, {{written about}} the year AD 161, was an {{introductory}} textbook of legal institutions divided into four books: the first treating of persons and the differences of the status they may occupy {{in the eye of}} <b>the</b> law; <b>the</b> <b>second</b> of <b>things,</b> and <b>the</b> modes in which rights over them may be acquired, including the law relating to wills; the third of intestate succession and of obligations; and the fourth of actions and their forms.|$|R
6000|$|... [Second.] <b>The</b> <b>Second</b> <b>thing</b> to {{be learned}} from these words, as they have a {{relation}} to them going before, is encouragement to those that are yet in the storm; and that from three great arguments.|$|E
6000|$|I could double, yea {{ten times}} {{double the number}} of these {{arguments}} against you, but I will pass from this to <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>thing.</b> 'The righteousness you have described, is not the true gospel inward holiness.' ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> {{noticeable}} <b>thing</b> about <b>the</b> calling conventions is {{that now}} all functions have an integrated error handling purpose similar to try{…}catch(…){…} and trow new Exception (...) of C++ and Java. In TScript since all functions return an error, the return statement operates similar to the throw statement. For example the statement:- return error = [...] "Have an error message"; will terminate the function and return the error message. Alternatively the blank statement;- return; will terminate the function but not return any error.|$|R
50|$|After {{three seasons}} with Hull as a player, in March 1934 Hill {{took over the}} {{managerial}} reins from Haydn Green. In his first season in charge, Hull finished comfortably mid-table in <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> Division. <b>Things</b> did not turn out so well in the following season, and in January 1936, Hill was dismissed, {{to be replaced by}} David Menzies who was unable to prevent Hull being relegated with only 20 points. As manager, Hill only won 24 out of 77 games, a win rate of 31.16%.|$|R
50|$|Nebraska {{experienced}} {{yet another}} slow start as the 1st quarter ended {{with only a}} Cornhusker field goal on the board, but in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> quarter <b>things</b> seemed to fall into place as Nebraska posted another 25 points by halftime without any response from Iowa State. The Cyclones managed to avoid the shutout with a field goal in the 4th, but avoiding the disgrace of the shutout was about all they accomplished for the day as they departed Lincoln with a 3-34 loss on the books.|$|R
