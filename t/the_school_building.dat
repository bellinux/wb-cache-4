The school's purpose was to teach students in farming, gardening, poultry-keeping, and other agriculture-related skills. The school moved to a farm near Poughkeepsie in 1903, and <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>building</b> was run as a hotel for two years until it became Miss Knox's School. After the building burned down in 1912, Miss Knox's School was relocated several times; since 1954, the Knox School has been located in St. James, New York.|$|E
5|$|Kehoe {{drove up}} to the school about half an hour after the explosion. He saw Superintendent Huyck and summoned him over to his truck. Charles Hawson testified at the inquest that he saw the two men {{struggle}} over some type of long gun before Kehoe detonated the dynamite stored in his truck, killing himself, Superintendent Huyck, Nelson McFarren (a retired farmer), and Cleo Clayton, an eight-year-old second grader. Clayton had survived the first blast and had wandered out of <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>building</b> debris; he was killed by the fragmentation from the exploding vehicle. The explosion also mortally wounded postmaster Glenn O. Smith, who lost a leg and died later that day of his wounds, and injured several others.|$|E
5|$|School ran {{at various}} times at localities near Meander including: Montana; Golden Valley; Western Creek; and Jacky's Marsh. A school opened on a {{property}} known as Cheshunt in 1907, as the Springdale School. In 1919 it was moved to Montana, and renamed Montana School in 1923. The building burned down December 1926. During rebuilding some students were educated at the Montana Baptist church, others at the school at Meander. The school closed in 1944, by which time there were only seven students. The Montana school building was moved {{to be part of}} the Meander School in 1947–48. A school was run at Golden Valley from 1870 to 1945, initially as a 1/2-day school. During most of its life it had around 30 students. After closing <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>building</b> was relocated to Meander School. Western Creek had a school from 1893 to 1938. After it closed some students attended Meander's school, but others moved to schools at Mole Creek and Deloraine. Unlike other schools in the area the building was not moved to Meander but instead to Mole Creek's school. Children from Jacky's Marsh travelled to Meander for schooling until 1900 when the Jacky's Marsh school opened. The school was closed 1910–22 and finally closed in 1937. <b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>building</b> was moved to Meander c1940.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} solutions for renovation processes in the ventilation of fifteen <b>school</b> <b>buildings.</b> <b>The</b> quality of indoor air as well as the operation of ventilation were studied. Both measurements and questionnaires to teachers were used before and after the renovation work. The quality of the indoor air measured in <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> was essentially improved as the renovation work proceeded. As the contents of carbon dioxide in <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> ranged between 1, 200 – 2, 400 ppm before the renovation work, they were below 1, 250 in the maximum in all <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> with only one exception after that. After the renovation the maximum carbon dioxide contents in <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>buildings</b> furnished with natural ventilation were decreased 850 ppm in the average.

5|$|Briarcliff Manor {{maintains}} {{strong ties}} to its history and traditions. During Briarcliff Manor's 1952 semicentennial, nine people served on the Historical Committee and published a village history book. In March 1974, after the mayor appointed twelve people for a 75th anniversary committee, the committee began by forming the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society (BMSHS). The historical society published an updated village history (A Village Between Two Rivers: Briarcliff Manor) in 1977, marking the 75th anniversary of the village. The historical society was initially located at the since-demolished Briarcliff Middle School building; it later moved {{to the second floor}} of a realty building on Pleasantville Road, and moved back to <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>building</b> after it was leased by Pace University. On March 21, 2010, the BMSHS was given a permanent location at the Eileen O'Connor Weber Historical Center, established as part of the expanded Briarcliff Manor Public Library. Members of the historical society joined the nine-member Centennial Committee in 2002 to organize events for Briarcliff Manor's centennial.|$|E
5|$|The {{school was}} still {{operating}} in 1937, though a public request {{had been made}} for regular transport to take children to the Hagley District School, in consequence of the Hadspen school's impending closure. Children from the town began attending the Hagley school in March 1938. By {{the middle of the}} same year a tender was approved by the Minister of Education for regular school transport. The transport was also for students from nearby Carrick., whose school closed in the 1930s. <b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>building</b> was finally removed; a tender in 1944 called for it to be removed and re-erected at Falmouth. Schools have also been run in other town buildings, including a hall near the Anglican church, that was used for worship before the church's completion, in what is now the Uniting Church and also in another building that later became a private home. In the 21st century there are no schools remaining in Hadspen.|$|E
5|$|The first {{institute}} {{for higher education}} in the village was the School of Practical Agriculture and Horticulture, which Walter Law helped establish on his Briarcliff Farms in 1900. The school taught students ages 16 to 35 in crop and livestock care. In 1902, the school moved to a larger location near Poughkeepsie and closed a year later {{due to a lack of}} funding. In addition, Briarcliff Manor has been the location for several colleges. Briarcliff Junior College was founded in 1903 at the Briarcliff Lodge, and moved near Briarcliff Congregational Church, on land Walter Law donated, in 1905. Among its trustees were Howard Deering Johnson, Norman Cousins, Carl Carmer, Thomas K. Finletter, William Zorach, Eduard C. Lindeman, and Lyman Bryson. Ordway Tead was chairman of the board of trustees, and his wife Clara was the college's first president. The school gradually improved its academic scope and standing, and was registered with the State Education Department and accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 1944. In 1951, the Board of Regents authorized the college to grant Associate of Arts and Associate of Applied Science degrees. The following year, the Army Map Service selected the college as the only one in the country for professional training in cartography. In 1956, the junior college started issuing bachelor's degrees, and became known as Briarcliff College. In 1977 Pace University bought Briarcliff College and the Spanish Renaissance-style Briarcliff Grade School building, incorporating them into its Pleasantville campus. The Briarcliff Grade School building, which housed the village public school from 1909 to 1980, became known as the Pace University Village Center. During Pace's occupation, the building housed the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society and the Village Youth Center. Pace University operated <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>building</b> until its demolition in 1996, and the Briarcliff College campus until 2015. At the Briarcliff Lodge property, the Edgewood Park School operated from 1936 to 1954, and King's College subsequently operated there from 1955 to 1994, also using the lodge building and other dormitories and academic buildings.|$|E
