5|$|Peter Ackroyd {{believes}} {{that it is impossible}} to paraphrase the content of the poem; the poem is too abstract to describe the events and the action that make up the poem's narrative structure. However, the philosophical basis for the poem can be explained since the discourse on time is connected to the ideas within St. Augustine's Confessions. As such, there is an emphasis on the present moment as being the only time period that really matters, because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown. The poem emphasizes that memory must be abandoned to understand the current world, and humans must realize that the universe is based on order. The poem also describes that although consciousness cannot be bound within time, humans cannot actually escape from time on their own. The scene beneath London is filled with the <b>time-bound</b> people who are similar to the spiritually empty populace of The Hollow Men; they are empty because they do not understand the Logos or the order of the universe. The conclusion of the poem emphasizes that God is the only one that is truly able to exist out of time and have knowledge of all times and places, but humankind is still capable of redemption through belief in Him and His ability to save them from the bounds of the material universe.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{concentrate}} on synthesis of real-time programs modeled by Alur and Dill timed automata for automatic addition {{of different types}} of <b>time-bounded</b> liveness properties. <b>Time-bounded</b> liveness (also called <b>time-bounded</b> response) – that something good will happen soon, in {{a certain amount of time}} – captures a wide range of requirements for specifying real-time and embedded systems. We show that the problem of automatic addition of a <b>time-bounded</b> liveness property to a given timed automaton while maintaining maximal nondeterminism is NP-hard in the size of locations of the input automaton. Furthermore, we show that by relaxing the maximality requirement we can devise a sound and complete algorithm that adds a <b>time-bounded</b> liveness property to a given timed automaton, while preserving its existing MTL specification. This synthesis method is useful in adding properties that are later discovered as a crucial part of a program. Moreover, we show that addition of interval <b>time-bounded</b> liveness, where the good thing should not happen sooner than a certain amount of time, is also NP-hard in the size of locations even without maximal nondeterminism. Finally, we show that adding <b>time-bounded</b> and interval <b>time-bounded</b> as well as unbounded liveness properties are all PSPACE-complete in the size of the input timed automaton...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{verification}} algorithms for inhomogeneous continuous time Markov chains (ICTMC), discrete time stochastic hybrid systems (DTSHS) and Markovian timed automata (MTA). For {{all of these}} three models we define the notions of <b>time-bounded</b> and time-unbounded reachability. We use <b>time-bounded</b> and time-unbounded reachability in order to compute the satisfiability probability of an omega-regular property. For ICTMCs we introduce the notions of <b>time-bounded</b> and time-unbounded reachability as a solution {{of a system of}} integral equations. We show that for the <b>time-bounded</b> case the reachability probability can be computed by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. For the time-unbounded case we consider two special classes of ICTMCs: periodic and uniform. For both classes we develop efficient techniques based on discrete time Markov chains (DTMCs) in order to compute the time-unbounded reachability. Using the time-unbounded measure we can compute the satisfiability probability for an omega-regular property against an ICTMC. We introduce the notions of <b>time-bounded</b> and time-unbounded reachability for DTSHS. We develop a discretization algorithm, where the DTSHS is discretized into a DTMC and the resulting reachability probabilities are computed as a solution of a system of linear equations. We compute also an error bound for the <b>time-bounded</b> reachability case. Using the notions of <b>time-bounded</b> and time-unbounded reachability we are able to verify whether a DTSHS satisfies a given omega-regular property. All obtained results are applied to a two-room heating example. We introduce MTA as an extension of timed automata with exponential distributions. We define the maximum <b>time-bounded</b> and time-unbounded reachability probabilities as a solution of a system of integral equations. We develop a discretization algorithm for the <b>time-bounded</b> reachability case. We discretize the MTA into a Markov decision process and we compute an error bound. For MTAs with a single clock we introduce a system of linear equations which solves the time-unbounded rechability case...|$|R

25|$|One {{consequence}} of these positions that Unger points {{to is the}} revision of the concept and function of mathematics. If {{there is only one}} world drenched in time through and through, then mathematics cannot be a timeless expression of multiple universes that captures reality. Rather, Unger argues that mathematics is a means of analyzing the world removed of time and phenomenal distinction. By emptying the world of time and space it is able to better focus on one aspect of reality: the recurrence of certain ways in which pieces of the world relate to other pieces. Its subject matter are the structured wholes and bundles of relations, which we see outside mathematics only as embodied in the <b>time-bound</b> particulars of the manifest world. In this way, mathematics extends our problem solving powers as an extension of human insight, {{but it is not a}} part of the world.|$|E
25|$|Goal-setting {{theory is}} based on the notion that {{individuals}} sometimes have a drive to reach a clearly defined end state. Often, this end state is a reward in itself. A goal's efficiency is affected by three features: proximity, difficulty and specificity. One common goal setting methodology incorporates the SMART criteria, in which goals are: specific, measurable, attainable/achievable, relevant, and <b>time-bound.</b> An ideal goal should present a situation where the time between the initiation of behavior and the end state is close. This explains why some children are more motivated to learn how to ride a bike than to master algebra. A goal should be moderate, not too hard or too easy to complete. In both cases, most people are not optimally motivated, as many want a challenge (which assumes some kind of insecurity of success). At the same time people want to feel that there is a substantial probability that they will succeed. Specificity concerns the description of the goal in their class. The goal should be objectively defined and intelligible for the individual. A classic example of a poorly specified goal is to get the highest possible grade. Most children have no idea how much effort they need to reach that goal.|$|E
