5|$|The film is set 32 {{years before}} the {{original}} film, and follows Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as <b>they</b> <b>protect</b> Queen Amidala, in hopes of securing a peaceful end to a large-scale interplanetary trade dispute. Joined by Anakin Skywalker—a young slave with unusually strong natural powers of the Force—they simultaneously contend with the mysterious return of the Sith.|$|E
5|$|Insects in {{the group}} are plant-eaters, with a few species at times {{becoming}} serious pests of cereals, vegetables and pasture, especially when they swarm in their millions as locusts and destroy crops over wide areas. <b>They</b> <b>protect</b> themselves from predators by camouflage; when detected, many species attempt to startle the predator with a brilliantly-coloured wing-flash while jumping and (if adult) launching themselves into the air, usually flying for only a short distance. Other species such as the rainbow grasshopper have warning coloration which deters predators. Grasshoppers are affected by parasites and various diseases, and many predatory creatures feed on both nymphs and adults. The eggs {{are the subject of}} attack by parasitoids and predators.|$|E
5|$|Stone brought Terry Hayes {{to write}} the {{screenplay}} entitled Return of the Apes. Set in the near future, a plague is making humans extinct. Geneticist Will Robinson discovers the plague is a genetic time bomb embedded in the Stone Age. He time travels with a pregnant colleague named Billie Rae Diamond {{to a time when}} Palaeolithic humans were at war {{for the future of the}} planet with highly evolved apes. The apes' supreme commander is a gorilla named Drak. Robinson and Billie Rae discover a young human girl named Aiv (pronounced Eve) to be the next step in evolution. It is revealed that it was the apes that created the virus to destroy the human race. <b>They</b> <b>protect</b> her from the virus, thus ensuring the survival of the human race 102,000 years later. Billie Rae gives birth to a baby boy named Adam.|$|E

5|$|The Earth {{experienced}} {{a number of}} changes during the time period megalodon existed which affected marine life. A cooling trend starting in the Oligocene 35 mya ultimately led to glaciation at the poles. Geological events changed currents and precipitation; among these were {{the closure of the}} Circumtropical Seaway between the Americas and through the Tethys Sea, contributing to the cooling of the oceans. The stalling of the Gulf Stream prevented nutrient-rich water from reaching major marine ecosystems, which may have negatively affected its food sources. As its range did not apparently extend into colder waters, megalodon may {{not have been able to}} retain a significant amount of metabolic heat, so its range was restricted to shrinking tropical waters. Fossil evidence confirms the absence of megalodon in regions around the world where water temperatures had significantly declined during the Pliocene. The largest fluctuation of sea levels in the Cenozoic era occurred in the Plio-Pleistocene, between around 5 mya to 12 thousand years ago (kya), due to the expansion of glaciers at the pole, which negatively impacted coastal environments, and may have contributed to its extinction along with those of several other marine megafaunal species. These oceanographic changes, in particular the sea level drops, may have restricted many of the suitable shallow warm-water nursery sites for megalodon, hindering reproduction. Nursery areas are pivotal for the survival of many shark species, in part because <b>they</b> <b>protect</b> juveniles from predation.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Hirschfeld's {{work with}} the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, Gerber {{resolved}} to found a similar organization in the United States. He called his group the Society for Human Rights (the English translation of Bund für Menschenrecht) and took {{on the role of}} secretary. Gerber filed an application for a charter as a non-profit organization with the state of Illinois on December 10, 1924. The application outlined the goals and purposes of the Society: o promote and protect the interests of people who by reasons of mental and physical abnormalities are abused and hindered in the legal pursuit of happiness which is guaranteed them by the Declaration of Independence and to combat the public prejudices against them by dissemination of factors according to modern science among intellectuals of mature age. The Society stands only for law and order; it is in harmony with any and all general laws insofar as <b>they</b> <b>protect</b> the rights of others, and does in no manner recommend any acts in violation of present laws nor advocate any manner inimical to the public welfare. An African American clergyman named John T. Graves signed on as president of the new organization and Gerber, Graves and five others were listed as directors. The state granted the charter on December 24, 1924, making the Society the oldest documented homosexual organization in the nation. Despite deliberately keeping the goals of the Society vague and excluding any mention of homosexuality from its mission statement, Society members were still surprised that no one with the state investigated any further before issuing the charter.|$|E

25|$|The {{soldiers}} of army ants {{are larger than}} the workers, and they have much larger mandibles than the worker class of ants, with older workers possessing larger heads and stronger mandibles than the younger ones. <b>They</b> <b>protect</b> the colony, and help carry the heaviest loads of prey to the nest.|$|E
25|$|Guarding males {{keep the}} embryos safe from predators, keep oxygen levels high by fanning water currents, {{and keep the}} area free from dead embryos and debris. <b>They</b> <b>protect</b> the embryos until they hatch, and often look after the larval stages as well.

25|$|Mafiosi {{generally}} do not involve themselves {{in the management of}} the businesses <b>they</b> <b>protect</b> or arbitrate. Lack of competence is a common reason, but mostly it is to divest themselves of any interests that may conflict with their roles as protectors and arbitrators.

From the Barons <b>they</b> <b>protected</b> Mike Fidler, Rick Hampton, Al MacAdam, Dennis Maruk, Greg Smith and goalie Gilles Meloche. After the Capitals and Blues had made their selections the North Stars would be able to add another player to their protected list (Ron Zanussi), and again after the Canucks and Penguins had made their choices (Bob Stewart).|$|R

25|$|Because pawns attack head on, and cannot defend each other, {{they tend}} to be lost early in the game, {{providing}} ammunition for such attacks. Dropping a pawn behind enemy lines, promoting it to a tokin (gold general), and dropping a second pawn immediately behind the tokin so that <b>they</b> <b>protect</b> each other makes a strong attack; it threatens the opponent's entire defense, but provides little value to the opponent if the attack fails and the pieces are captured.|$|E
25|$|Bells {{also have}} an {{ambiguous}} role; while <b>they</b> <b>protect</b> against fairies, the fairies riding on horseback— such as the fairy queen— often have bells on their harness. This may be a distinguishing trait between the Seelie Court from the Unseelie Court, such that fairies use them {{to protect themselves from}} more wicked members of their race. Another ambiguous piece of folklore revolves about poultry: a cock's crow drove away fairies, but other tales recount fairies keeping poultry.|$|E
25|$|In plants, {{the solid}} {{long-chain}} alkanes {{are found in}} the plant cuticle and epicuticular wax of many species, but are only rarely major constituents. <b>They</b> <b>protect</b> the plant against water loss, prevent the leaching of important minerals by the rain, and protect against bacteria, fungi, and harmful insects. The carbon chains in plant alkanes are usually odd-numbered, between 27 and 33 carbon atoms in length and are made by the plants by decarboxylation of even-numbered fatty acids. The exact composition of the layer of wax is not only species-dependent but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions, temperature or humidity.|$|E

25|$|The most {{eye-catching}} {{decoration of}} the otherwise drab Fachhallenhaus is {{found on the}} point of the gables and consists of carved wooden boards in the shape of (stylised) horses' heads. The boards do serve a constructional purpose in that <b>they</b> <b>protect</b> the edges of the roof from the wind. The horses' heads are attributed to the symbol of the Saxons, the Saxon Steed. Its distribution as decoration on roof ridges is also reflected in the coats of arms of several north Germany towns and villages. In some regions, e. g. in the Hanoverian Wendland, the gable points often have an artistically turned post instead, the so-called Wendenknüppel.|$|E
25|$|Paramilitaries, {{including}} the Zetas, have now entered uncharted territories. <b>They</b> <b>protect</b> not only drug cartels but also many other financially profitable {{industries such as}} oil, gas, kidnapping, and counterfeiting electronics. There has been a complete and total loss of control {{by the government and}} the only response has been to increase army presence, notably an army whose officials are often paid off or are already on the drug cartels payroll. The United States has stepped in to offer support in the “war on drugs” by the way of funding, American training and military support, and transforming the Mexican judicial system to parallel the American system.|$|E
25|$|Shields are rechargeable; <b>they</b> <b>protect</b> from damage but are {{depleted}} when absorbing damage. When the player's craft is unshielded, {{enemy fire}} will damage the player's hull. Hull damage can disable systems, {{such as the}} engines or targeting computer. Disabled systems will slowly be repaired; TIE Fighter allows the player to choose {{the order in which}} systems are repaired. Hull damage may also cause cockpit displays to break, rendering them useless {{for the remainder of the}} mission. Heavy hull damage will destroy the player's spacecraft. When the player's craft is destroyed before completing a mission, or the mission is otherwise a failure, the player can attempt the mission again. However, the mission is still successful if the player's craft is destroyed after all primary mission objectives are completed.|$|E

25|$|The primary way {{to boost}} levels of {{immunity}} {{in a population}} is through vaccination. Their use is originally based on the observation that milkmaids exposed to cowpox were immune to smallpox, so the practice of inoculating people with the cowpox virus began {{as a way to}} prevent smallpox cases. Well-developed vaccines provide protection in a far safer way than natural infections, as vaccines generally do not cause the diseases <b>they</b> <b>protect</b> against and severe adverse effects are significantly less common than complications from natural infections. The immune system does not distinguish between natural infections and vaccines, forming an active response to both, so immunity induced via vaccination is similar to what would have occurred from contracting and recovering from the disease. To achieve herd immunity through vaccination, vaccine manufacturers aim to produce vaccines with low failure rates and policy makers aim to encourage their use. After the successful introduction and widespread use of a vaccine, sharp declines in the incidence of diseases it protects against can be observed, necessarily decreasing the number of hospitalizations and deaths caused by such diseases.|$|E
25|$|Gas mask {{development}} {{since has}} mirrored {{the development of}} chemical agents in warfare, filling {{the need to protect}} against ever more deadly threats, biological weapons, and radioactive dust in the nuclear era. However, where agents that cause harm through contact or penetration of the skin occurs, such as blister agent or nerve agent, a gas mask alone is not sufficient protection, and full protective clothing must be worn in addition, to protect from contact with the atmosphere. For reasons of civil defense and personal protection, individuals often buy gas masks believing that <b>they</b> <b>protect</b> against the harmful effects of an attack with nuclear, biological, or chemical (NBC) agents; which is only partially true, as gas masks protect only against respiratory absorption. Whilst most military gas masks are designed to be capable of protection against all NBC agents, they can have filter canisters proof against those agents (heavier) or only against riot control agents and smoke (lighter, and often used for training purposes); likewise there are lightweight masks solely for use in riot control agents and not for NBC situations.|$|E
25|$|Domesticated {{horses are}} also subject to {{inconsistent}} movement between stabling and work; they must carry or pull additional weight, and in modern times, {{they are often}} kept and worked on very soft footing, such as irrigated land, arena footing, or stall bedding. In some cases, management is also inadequate. The hooves of horses that are kept in stalls or small turnouts, even when cleaned adequately, are exposed to more moisture than would be encountered in the wild, {{as well as to}} ammonia from urine. The hoof capsule is mostly made from keratin, a protein, and is weakened by this exposure, becoming even more fragile and soft. Shoes do not prevent or reduce damage from moisture and ammonia exposure. Rather, <b>they</b> <b>protect</b> already weakened hooves. Further, without the natural conditioning factors present in the wild, the feet of horses grow overly large and long unless trimmed regularly. Hence, protection from rocks, pebbles, and hard, uneven surfaces is lacking. A balanced diet with proper nutrition also is a factor. Without these precautions, cracks in overgrown and overly brittle hoof walls are a danger, as is bruising of the soft tissues within the foot because of inadequately thick and hard sole material.|$|E
25|$|To {{strengthen}} {{ties with}} the soldiers <b>they</b> <b>protected,</b> Deatrick encouraged his flyers to take troops on orientation flights above the battle fields.
