5|$|Rather than {{turn left}} towards Concord, Marine Lieutenant Jesse Adair, {{at the head}} of the advance guard, decided on his own to protect the flank of the British column by first turning right and then leading the {{companies}} onto the Common itself, in a confused effort to surround and disarm the militia. Major Pitcairn arrived from the rear of the advance force and led his three companies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> halted them. The remaining companies under Colonel Smith lay further down the road toward Boston.|$|E
5|$|The unit {{insignia}} was a stylised Týr rune with arrows pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> right. A collar insignia was manufactured, but it {{is believed}} that these were never issued or worn, {{and the members of the}} division wore the standard SS Sig runes.|$|E
5|$|Tiller {{effect is}} the {{expression}} {{used to describe}} how handlebars that extend far behind the steering axis (head tube) act like a tiller on a boat, in that one moves the bars to the right in order to turn the front wheel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> <b>and</b> vice versa. This situation is commonly found on cruiser bicycles, some recumbents, and some motorcycles. It can be troublesome when it limits the ability to steer because of interference or the limits of arm reach.|$|E

Around the central scene small figures of the twelve Apostles carrying their identifying attributes emerge from the foliage border of oak leaves and tendrils; the uppermost heads on each side are replacements, probably by Weininger in the 1860s.|$|E
5|$|To {{the right}} of the centre room are two small {{exhibition}} rooms entered through a screen with two further etched glass windows by Lord, of summer and spring. The first chamber, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> the smallest (the counterpart of the chapel of St Padarn), is Sulien’s room, which has an incised slate floor slab and lettered text around wall from the Elegy of Rhygyfarch, both by Ieuan Rees.|$|E
5|$|To use Lorenz, a {{conventional}} radio was {{tuned to the}} transmission, and the operator would listen for the signal and try {{to determine if they}} heard dots or dashes. If they heard dots, the short 0.2s pulse, they would know they were too far <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> <b>and</b> turned to the right in order to reach the centreline. Dashes indicated they should turn left. In the centre the receiver could hear both signals, which merged to form a steady tone, the equisignal.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{are visible}} in stalls. Behind {{them is a}} {{crumbling}} wall with three low Romanesque windows. Four shepherds in contemporary 15th-century clothing are chatting amiably, leaning against the wall, looking into the shed. Two are positioned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> two to the right; in each pair one is dressed in red and an other in blue. Behind the shed is a small hill where two shepherds herd sheep along a pathway, and beyond is a Netherlandish town with two domed structures in its center, symbolizing Jerusalem and Christ's Passion. The large domed building {{is based on the}} Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, a replica of which the Adornes family built in Bruges in 1427, called the Jerusalem chapel. A flock of geese is visible high in the sky through the roof's trusses.|$|E
5|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, and as {{originally}} described by , Rule 184 {{may be used to}} model deposition of particles onto a surface. In this model, one has a set of particles that occupy a subset of the positions in a square lattice oriented diagonally (the darker particles in the figure). If a particle is present at some position of the lattice, the lattice positions below and to the right, and below and {{to the left of the}} particle must also be filled, so the filled part of the lattice extends infinitely downward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> right. The boundary between filled and unfilled positions (the thin black line in the figure) is interpreted as modeling a surface, onto which more particles may be deposited. At each time step, the surface grows by the deposition of new particles in each local minimum of the surface; that is, at each position where it is possible to add one new particle that has existing particles below it on both sides (the lighter particles in the figure).|$|E
5|$|Coulthard {{started from}} pole {{position}} alongside Michael Schumacher. Coulthard's teammate Häkkinen began from third. At the first corner Michael Schumacher moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> Giancarlo Fisichella collided {{with him and}} both drivers retired. Häkkinen took {{the lead of the}} race which he held until an intruder penetrated circuit limits on lap 25 causing drivers to make pit stops under safety car conditions. Barrichello, meanwhile, had gained thirteen positions to run fifth until the first safety car period. Häkkinen retook the lead after Coulthard pitted on lap 27. Barrichello stayed out on dry slick tyres, taking the lead which he held to clinch the first victory of his Formula One career.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Records {{found that}} the plane {{did not respond to}} his control column. Even with the control column turned {{all the way to the}} left, {{commanding}} maximum left aileron, and pulled all the way back, commanding maximum up elevatorinputs that would never be used together in normal flight, commanding a roll <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> the aircraft's nose to risethe aircraft was instead banking to the right with the nose dropping. Haynes attempted to level the aircraft with his own control column, then both Haynes and Records tried using their control columns together, but the aircraft still did not respond. Afraid the aircraft would roll into a completely inverted position (an unrecoverable situation), the crew reduced the left wingmounted engine to idle and applied maximum power to the right engine. This caused the airplane to slowly level out.|$|E
5|$|Once Jellicoe's ships had rendezvoused {{with the}} 2nd Battle Squadron, coming from Cromarty, Scotland, {{on the morning}} of 31 May, he {{organised}} {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet in parallel columns of divisions of four dreadnoughts each. The two divisions of the 2nd Battle Squadron were on his left (east), the 4th Battle Squadron was in the centre and the 1st Battle Squadron on the right. When Jellicoe ordered the Grand Fleet to deploy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> form line astern in anticipation of encountering the High Seas Fleet, this naturally placed the 2nd Battle Squadron at the head of the line of battle. The sisters were able to fire a few volleys at the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group without effect early in the battle, but the manoeuvers of their escorting light cruisers frequently blocked their views of the German ships. Coupled with the visibility problems from the smoke and mist, none of the King George Vs were able to fire more than 19 rounds from their main guns.|$|E
5|$|PA 263 narrows to two lanes {{past this}} {{intersection}} and forms a concurrency with US 202 {{a short distance}} later. The two routes run along a two-lane undivided road that heads through fields and woodland with some development, passing through the community of Holicong. Upon reaching the unincorporated village of Lahaska, the two routes split, with PA 263 bearing off <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> becoming Upper York Road, a two-lane undivided road. The route passes through Peddler's Village before coming to an intersection with Street Road. At Street Road, PA 263 exits Buckingham Township and enters Solebury Township.|$|E

5|$|Reports {{of damage}} to the {{hypoglossal}} nerve are rare. The most common causes of injury in one case series were compression by tumours and gunshot wounds. A wide variety of other causes can lead to damage of the nerve. These include surgical damage, medullary stroke, multiple slcerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, infection, sarcoidosis, and presence of an ectatic vessel in the hypoglossal canal. Damage can be on one or both sides, which will affect symptoms that the damage causes. Because of the close proximity of the nerve to other structures including nerves, arteries, and veins, it is rare for the nerve to be damaged in isolation. For example, damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> right hypoglossal nerves may occur with damage to the facial and trigeminal nerves {{as a result of}} damage from a clot following arteriosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar artery. Such a stroke may result in tight oral musculature, and difficulty speaking, eating and chewing.|$|E
5|$|Sutton Court {{is built}} of squared and coursed {{sandstone}} rubble throughout with freestone and ashlar dressings, copings, slate roofs. The north front comprises a central three-storey fourteenth century pele tower with a taller circular stair turret and two-storey ranges linking {{it to the}} 1558 'Bess of Hardwick Building' <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> a four bay 1858–1860 servants' wing of three storeys to the right. Windows to the pele tower and right-hand linking range are 15th century, of two cusped lights with hood moulds, {{some of which have}} been renewed, and some relocated from other areas. The doorway to the tower dates from 1858–60. The windows to the left-hand linking range and the 'Hardwick Building' are four and six lights, with chamfered mullions. The two-storey 'Hardwick' range has diagonal offset buttresses. There are eighteenth-century battlements to the pele tower, with tall octagonal ashlar stacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{date that}} the {{building}} was first constructed is uncertain, with best estimates putting the build date during the Georgian era around the late 17th century as a timber-framed house; this {{is determined by the}} chamfered beams and the rectangular lobby entrance with the front door centrally-located, opening to back-to-back fireplaces with main rooms <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> right, known as a 'baffle-entry' layout. It transitioned into use as a public house by 1754, which is a common origin of country pubs. It was mentioned in the Melville's Directory of 1858, with Joseph Charlton as the licensee. In 1895 William Sayer, a former landlord of the pub, was killed in a collapse at a nearby chalk mine. It appears on historical maps from 1867, 1897 and various others since, and was labelled as the Royal Oak Public House on all but the first. A number of brickworks were located adjacent to the pub in the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E

5|$|The general concept pre-dated the Mk. IV and was {{essentially}} a UK version of the German Lorenz beam system. Lorenz, or Standard Beam Approach as it was known in the UK, used a single transmitter located off {{the far end of}} the active runway that was alternately connected to one of two slightly directional antennas using a motorized switch. The antennas were aimed so they sent their signals <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> right of the runway, but their signals overlapped down the centreline. The switch spent 0.2seconds connected to the left antenna (as seen from the aircraft) and then 1second on the right.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} investigation {{concluded that}} the flight, regarded as a controlled flight into terrain, was caused by pilot errors {{and that there was}} no fault with the aircraft. Contributing factors causing the accident were lack of a procedure for offset localizer approach for setting approach course on the HSIs. Thus, both HSIs were set incorrectly, which along with the course deviation indicator hinted that the plane was being blown <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> needed to adjust course to the right. Because he was in a stressed situation, the navigator set the GPS in the wrong mode. He also did not have sufficient time to recheck his work, allowing mistakes to happen, and his work was not monitored by the pilots. As the navigator was overworked, it was inappropriate for the first officer to transfer the responsibility of lateral control to him.|$|E
