40|$|The {{increased}} use of giant magnetostrictive, <b>Terfenol-D</b> transducers {{in a wide variety}} of applications has led to a need for greater understanding of the materials performance. This dissertation attempts to add to the <b>Terfenol-D</b> transducer body of knowledge by providing an in-depth analysis and modeling of an experimental transducer. A description of the magnetostriction process related to <b>Terfenol-D</b> includes a discussion of material properties, production methods, and the effect of mechanical stress, magnetization, and temperature on the material performance. The understanding of the <b>Terfenol-D</b> material performance provides the basis for an analysis of the performance of a <b>Terfenol-D</b> transducer. Issues related to the design and utilization of the <b>Terfenol-D</b> material in the transducers are considered, including the magnetic circuit, application of mechanical prestress, and tuning of the mechanical resonance. Experimental results from two broadband, Tonpilz design transducers show the effects of operating conditions (prestress, magnetic bias, AC magnetization amplitude, and frequency) on performance. In an effort to understand and utlilize the rich performance space described by the experimental results a variety of models are considered. An overview of models applicable to <b>Terfenol-D</b> and <b>Terfenol-D</b> transducers is provided, including a discussion of modeling criteria. The Jiles-Atherton model of ferromagnetic hysteresis is employed to describe the quasi-static transducer performance. This model requires the estimation of only six physically-based parameters to accurately simulate performance. The model is shown to be robust with respect to model parameters over a range of mechanical prestress, magnetic biases, and AC magnetic field amplitudes, allowing predictive capability within these ranges. An additional model, based on electroacoustics theory, explains trends in the frequency domain and facilitates an analysis of efficiency based on impedance and admittance analysis.

40|$|A major {{limitation}} in use {{of electromagnetic}} and/or magnetomechanical models for design of <b>Terfenol-D</b> actuators {{is the lack}} of reliable material property data for <b>Terfenol-D.</b> In particular data on the performance of <b>Terfenol-D</b> as employed in a transducer, operating under real world dynamic conditions is needed. To provide this information, <b>Terfenol-D</b> rod properties need to be measured under as run prestressed and magnetically biased states.

The development of the material properties measurements and calculations is based on the model of low signal, linear, magnetostriction from Clark, the linear transduction equations for a transducer from Hunt, and a one degree of freedom mechanical model of the transducer. The electrical impedance and admittance mobility loops are used to determine the resonant, anti-resonant, and half power point frequencies.

Rack and pinion, chain, belt, cable, screw, {{hydraulic}} and electric solenoid {{are a few of}} the many types of actuators available. All have inherent strengths and weakness such as power consumption, mechanical failure and usually a trade off with speed and resolution. The thesis investigation is to develop a linear motion actuator based on the magnetic material, <b>Terfenol-D</b> which alters its shape when subjected to a magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as magnetostriction which can be defined as a changing of a material's physical dimensions in response to its magnetization. <b>Terfenol-D</b> has the largest known magnetostriction, 2000 ppm at ambient temperatures [1], of all commercially available materials. Because of these large strains it is given the term Giant Magnetostriction (GM). In <b>Terfenol-D</b> the GM is dependent on the direction of the applied magnetic field with respect to the direction in the crystal: the material elongates in the direction of the field and, orthogonal to this, the material contracts within the principal of constant volume. This property has been exploited by other researchers in the past resulting in <b>Terfenol-D</b> being used as a short stroke conventional actuator in applications requiring large force at both high and low frequencies, generating a range of applications including surgical instruments, ultrasonic transducers and many others. It is this property of <b>Terfenol-D</b> that will be exploited in this project in the development of the magnetostrictive linear motor.

40|$|The study {{toward the}} design of a {{magnetostrictive}} generator for vibration-to-electrical energy conversion in helicopter is presented in this report. <b>Terfenol-D,</b> a giant magnetostrictive material is used. A brief overview of magnetostriction including <b>Terfenol-D</b> properties is given. The generator uses vibrations as input. These vibrations are studied for different possible locations in helicopter. The main and tail rotors are the principal origins of vibrations in a helicopter. Currently, lead-lag dampers are used between the rotor and the rotor blades to damp vibrations. The proposal is to replace these dampers by a magnetostrictive generator to damp and produce electrical power simultaneously. The third location studied is between the pylon and the airframe. The generator could be put between the gearbox and the airframe instead of the existing rigid struts. Forces, amplitudes, vibration frequencies and mechanical power have been evaluated at each location. This study reveals that a damping system is always necessary in order to preserve the active material (<b>Terfenol-D</b> rod) of the transducer. The damping system adapts the input vibration level to the <b>Terfenol-D</b> rod properties. In all three locations the force and strain amplitude have to be adjusted.

40|$|Magnetostriction is {{the change}} in shape of {{materials}} {{under the influence of}} an external magnetic field. The cause of magnetostriction change in length {{is the result of the}} rotation of small magnetic domains. This rotation and re-orientation causes internal strains in the material structure. The strains in the structure lead to the stretching (in the case of positive magnetostriction) of the material in the direction of the magnetic field. During this stretching process the cross-section is reduced in a way that the volume is kept nearly constant. The size of the volume change is so small that it can be neglected under normal operating conditions. Applying a stronger field leads to stronger and more definite re-orientation of more and more domains in the direction of magnetic field. When all the magnetic domains have become aligned with the magnetic field the saturation point has been achieved. This paper presents the state of the art of the magnetostrictive materials and their applications such as: Reaction Mass Actuator, A standard <b>Terfenol-D</b> Actuator, Linear Motor Based on <b>Terfenol-D</b> (Worm Motor), <b>Terfenol-D</b> in Sonar Transducers, <b>Terfenol-D</b> Wireless Rotational Motor, <b>Terfenol-D</b> Electro-Hydraulic Actuator, Wireless Linear Micro-Motor, Magnetostrictive Film Applications, Magnetostrictive Contactless Torque Sensors and many other applications.
