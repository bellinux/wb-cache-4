25|$|The {{principle}} of the <b>time</b> <b>value</b> of money explains why interest is paid or earned: Interest, whether it is on a bank deposit or debt, compensates the depositor or lender for the <b>time</b> <b>value</b> of money.|$|E
25|$|The <b>time</b> <b>value</b> of {{an option}} {{is the total}} value of the option, less the {{intrinsic}} value. It partly arises from the uncertainty of future price movements of the underlying. A component of the <b>time</b> <b>value</b> also arises from the unwinding of the discount rate between now and the expiry date. In the case of a European option, the option cannot be exercised before the expiry date, so it is possible for the <b>time</b> <b>value</b> to be negative; for an American option if the <b>time</b> <b>value</b> is ever negative, you exercise it (ignoring special circumstances such as the security going ex dividend): this yields a boundary condition.|$|E

50|$|That same day, Linus Torvalds {{replied with}} a concern {{that the use of}} 32-bit <b>time</b> <b>values</b> in the x32 ABI could cause {{problems}} in the future. This is because the use of 32-bit <b>time</b> <b>values</b> would cause the <b>time</b> <b>values</b> to overflow in the year 2038. Following this request, the developers of the x32 ABI changed the <b>time</b> <b>values</b> to 64-bit.|$|R

50|$|The second {{concept in}} {{programming}} the MC-4 are <b>time</b> <b>values.</b> The step <b>time</b> <b>values</b> determine the <b>time</b> interval between each musical note, or pitch. To set the <b>time</b> <b>values,</b> one must first {{set a time}} base, typically 120. This means that a quarter note = 120, a sixteenth note = 30, an eighth note = 60, etc. Esoteric timings can be programmed by entering any number against whatever time base is entered. The third programming concept is the gate time. This gate time refers to the actual sounded value; whether the phrasing is legato, staccato, semi detached etc.|$|R

50|$|In {{the area}} of <b>time</b> <b>values,</b> Marchetto {{improved}} on the old Franconian system of notation; music notation was by this time evolving into the method known today where an individual symbol represented a specific time-value, and Marchetto contributed to this trend by developing a method of compound time division, and by assigning specific note shapes to specific <b>time</b> <b>values.</b>|$|R

30|$|Excluding set size as {{a factor}} meant that slopes over set size {{could no longer be}} computed, so a {{slightly}} different data analysis strategy was implemented compared to Study 1. Hence, the following analysis is based on reaction <b>time</b> <b>values.</b> However, a shorter reaction time compared to a longer one can also be described as a more efficient search, so we expected to find the same interaction pattern between TDS and DDS on reaction <b>time</b> <b>values</b> as in Study 1. More precisely, we expected an increase in reaction <b>time</b> <b>values</b> as the target grew more similar to the distractors. This effect was expected to be more pronounced when DDS was high compared to low.|$|R

25|$|For example, in {{classical}} mechanics, {{the motion of}} a body is described by its position and velocity as the <b>time</b> <b>value</b> varies. Newton's laws allow (given the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body) one to express these variables dynamically as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body {{as a function of}} time.|$|E
25|$|CBA {{is related}} to (but {{distinct}} from) cost-effectiveness analysis. In CBA, benefits and costs are expressed in monetary terms, and are adjusted for the <b>time</b> <b>value</b> of money, so that all flows of benefits and flows of project costs over time (which tend to occur {{at different points in}} time) are expressed on a common basis in terms of their net present value.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} {{a model of}} urban transport with two trip purposes, commuting (assumed perfectly complementary to labour supply) and non-commuting, to analyse the effects of transport tax reform on the <b>value</b> of <b>time</b> and marginal external congestion costs. Higher commuting taxes plausibly reduce <b>time</b> <b>values,</b> but higher non-commuting transport prices will typically raise the <b>value</b> of <b>time.</b> The intuition for this latter finding is that the reduction in congestion that follows from the tax increase itself raises net wages per hour of work (inclusive of commuting time). Empirical illustrations with Belgian data show a potentially large effect of transport tax reform on <b>time</b> <b>values.</b> In {{quite a few of}} the tax reforms studied traffic levels are reduced, but the increase in <b>time</b> <b>values</b> implies that marginal external congestion costs actually increase...|$|R
