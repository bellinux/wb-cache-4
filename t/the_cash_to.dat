25|$|Southampton won the Southern League {{championship}} {{for three}} years running between 1897 and 1899 and again in 1901, 1903 and 1904. During this time, they moved to a newly built £10,000 stadium called The Dell, to the northwest of the city centre in 1898. Although they would spend the next 103 years there, the future was far from certain {{in those early days}} and the club had to rent the premises first before they could stump up <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>to</b> buy the stadium {{in the early part of}} the 20th century. The club reached the first of their four FA Cup Finals in 1900. On that day, they went down 4–0 to Bury and two years later they would suffer a similar fate at the hands of Sheffield United as they were beaten 2–1 in a replay of the 1902 final.|$|E
25|$|Animosity {{between the}} Watts and Mitchell {{families}} escalates. Sam {{is left in}} charge of the Mitchell empire when her brother, Phil, goes on the run after escaping prison for an armed robbery — for which he has been set up for by Den. Sam persuades her cousin Billy (Perry Fenwick) to torch Phil's snooker club in an insurance scam, an act that results in Den's club burning down and his daughter Vicki (Scarlett Johnson) nearly perishing in the fire. Dennis vows revenge and he is only warned off when gangster Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) begins a relationship with Sam. Andy marries Sam in September 2004, despite Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi)'s attempt to stop the event — he has fallen in love with Sam and knows Andy is using her to gain control of the Mitchell assets. Andy fools Sam into signing over control of Phil's house, and she is then conned out of all the Mitchell businesses by family lawyer Marcus Christie (Stephen Churchett) and Den. Marcus tells Sam that Phil wants her to sell everything and give <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>to</b> him. She does so, selling her mother's pub, The Vic, for a vastly reduced price to Den. Marcus is lying, and once he has the Mitchells' money, he flees, leaving Sam with nothing. Andy, realising Sam is no use to him, throws her out of their house, leaving her penniless.|$|E

Stacey reveals to Alfie that their rent is increasing and Kat is struggling with money. Alfie then invites Kat to his flat for lunch and they reminisce about their relationship. The next day, Kat lashes out at Alfie for leaving leftovers for the children, but {{at the urging of}} Stacey, she agrees to be his date to Ian and Jane's wedding if he makes more effort for making up for the fire. On the wedding day, she gets heavily drunk, and during the reception, shoves Sonia Fowler's (Natalie Cassidy) head into the wedding cake. When the nursery raise their rates, Kat is forced to leave the children in Mo's care to work her shift at the market, but ends up having drinks with Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson). When Mo brings the children over to the pub, they misbehave and Kat is thrown out of the pub. Undeterred, Kat and Kim continue drinking and sneak into the pub to steal another bottle of wine. Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), catches them, and while Kim leaves to find <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>to</b> pay for it, Linda prepares to call social services to tell them of Kat's irresponsibility as a mother, but Kat snatches Linda's phone and throws it across the ground. When Kim returns with Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), she confesses her fears about being a bad mother, resulting in the other three women sharing their experiences of motherhood and reassuring her. Kat also tells Linda to speak to Mick about her fears that the baby may not be his. Linda then realises that the phone call was still connected, and promises to fix things to make sure social services do not know about what happened, however Kat receives a call from a social worker requesting to visit her. Kat is surprised when a lawyer visits her about Harry telling her about a compensation case with four other women also raped by Harry.|$|E

500|$|Most of the 1215 {{charter and}} later {{versions}} sought {{to govern the}} feudal rights of the Crown over the barons. Under the Angevin kings, and in particular during John's reign, {{the rights of the}} King had frequently been used inconsistently, often in an attempt to maximise the royal income from the barons. Feudal relief was one way that a king could demand money, and clauses 2 and 3 fixed the fees payable when an heir inherited an estate or when a minor came of age and took possession of his lands. Scutage was a form of medieval taxation; all knights and nobles owed military service to the Crown in return for their lands, which theoretically belonged to the King, but many preferred to avoid this service and offer money instead; the Crown [...] often used <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>to</b> pay for mercenaries. The rate of scutage that should be payable, and the circumstances under which it was appropriate for the King to demand it, was uncertain and controversial; clauses 12 and 14 addressed the management of the process.|$|E

Prior to their appointment of him as a parish priest at Warmington in 1281, they had appointed him to Northborough parish twelve years earlier; but his second parish was by far the most lucrative. In him, it has been said, [...] "Peterborough had found a royal justice, bound in loyalty by the grant." [...] For example, in 1288 he granted the Abbey his manor of Southorpe, and when eventually the Abbey came to buy it, Beckingham lent them some of <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>to</b> do so. In this way, contemporaries noted, Beckingham enabled the Abbey to circumvent the king's statute against land passing to the Church. As some point he appears to have also acted as agent and money lender for the Abbey, as well as hearing their cases that came before him personally in court, for instance, in the Abbey's purchase of Polebrook manor and when the Abbey found itself in dispute with the bishop of Lincoln and other Abbeys. He also acted administratively such as witnessing oaths of homage to the Abbey.|$|E

The timing proved unfortunate as this extensive borrowing {{was added to the}} already large bond debt of the earlier CH, and it came as the United States entered the Great Depression, which lasted ten years to 1939.

2500|$|Although {{in theory}} all {{property}} of the debtor that is not excluded from the estate under the Bankruptcy Code becomes {{property of the}} estate (i.e., is automatically transferred from the debtor to the estate) {{at the time of}} commencement of a case, an individual debtor (not a partnership, corporation, etc.) may claim certain items of property as [...] "exempt" [...] and thereby keep those items (subject, however, to any valid liens or other encumbrances).

Almost 40 states have done so. In states where the debtor is allowed to choose between the federal and state exemptions, the debtor has the opportunity to choose the exemptions that most fully benefit him or her and, in many cases, may convert at least some of his or her property from non-exempt form (e.g., cash) to exempt form (e.g., increased equity in a home created by using <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>to</b> pay down a mortgage) prior to filing the bankruptcy case.|$|E

2500|$|Butterfield did, however, play a minor role in Watergate. Nixon had $1.6 {{million in}} {{campaign}} funds {{left over from}} the 1968 election. Determined to raise as much re-election money as he could before a new federal campaign finance law took effect on April 7, 1972, Nixon's staff and political operatives began raising large amounts of cash. Some of this cash was used for illegal purposes connected with the Watergate scandal, such as surveillance and paying for the Watergate burglary. Haldeman retained $350,000 in cash in a locked briefcase in the office of Hugh W. Sloan Jr. at the Committee for the Re-Election of the President. Haldeman said the case, colloquially known as [...] "the 350", was for polling operations. Haldeman aide Gordon C. Strachan moved <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>to</b> the White House in April 1972, but Haldeman ordered it removed.

On April 7, Butterfield removed the cash and met a close friend at the Key Bridge Marriott in Rosslyn, Virginia. The friend agreed to keep the cash in a safe deposit box in Arlington County, Virginia, and make it available to the White House on demand.

2500|$|The {{donation}} kickback scheme {{which led}} to Carey's eventual expulsion from the Teamsters was created in July 1996. Early internal Carey re-election campaign polls showed Carey losing badly to Hoffa. Hoffa was also out-raising Carey in funds by more than 4-to-1, and the Carey campaign and outside fund-raising consultants were convinced much of Hoffa's funds were coming from organized crime sources. Carey re-election campaign aides, however, were confident Carey could win if he could bypass the local leadership (which supported Hoffa) and get his message directly to Teamsters members. In late July, Carey campaign manager Jere Nash met with Martin Davis, who owned The November Group (a direct-marketing company). Nash and Davis concluded a direct mail and phone bank effort would cost $700,000, money the Carey campaign did not have. Nash agreed to raise $300,000 and Davis agreed to raise the rest. Davis sought out fund-raiser Michael Ansara to brainstorm ways to raise the funds. On October 6, Ansara went to California and met with 300 wealthy donors to liberal causes. One of those donors was a major fund-raiser for Citizen Action, a coalition of left-wing public interest organizations with chapters in 24 states. The donor and Ansara hatched a plan: [...] In exchange for a $475,000 donation to Citizen Action, the Carey campaign would get a $100,000 donation from Citizen Action and Citizen Action would pay $75,000 to Ansara. Meanwhile, Davis contacted AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer Richard Trumka and allegedly concocted a scheme whereby the Teamsters would donate $150,000 to the AFL-CIO for spurious get-out-the-vote efforts and the AFL-CIO would pay the same amount to Citizen Action. Citizen Action would then pay $100,000 to The November Group, which would use <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>to</b> finance Carey's direct marketing effort. Davis also met {{with members of the}} Clinton-Gore campaign, and suggested that the Teamsters would make major donations to Democratic state parties if wealthy donors (who, for whatever reason, might be prohibited by law from donating to political parties) would make donations to the Carey re-election bid. The Teamsters donated $236,500 to Democratic state parties, but when no acceptable donations were made to the Carey campaign by the wealthy donors the scheme fell apart and no donation exchanges were made.|$|E
