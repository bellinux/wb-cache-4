5|$|Intimidator 305 {{features}} two trains themed as Dale Earnhardt's black number 3 car. The trains feature headlights at {{the front}} of each train as well as advertisement stickers that are found on NASCAR cars. One train is red with the other being silver. Each train has eight four-passenger cars, allowing thirty-two passengers per train. The trains are arranged in stadium-style seating with overhead lap bars fitted with soft, padded over-the-shoulder straps. In early July 2010, the ride received a unique new restraint design. The over-the-shoulder part of <b>the</b> <b>harness</b> now resembles a padded seat belt rather than the typical over-the-shoulder restraints used by Intamin.|$|E
5|$|Once in the station, riders board a train sitting down, in {{a similar}} style to {{inverted}} roller coasters. Riders are restrained through a padded over-the-shoulder harness and a lap bar. At the ankles, two flaps hold the legs in position and close as <b>the</b> <b>harness</b> locks into place. After a train is fully locked and checked, riders are raised into the flying position and the train departs the station. Since being rethemed to Galactica for 2016, riders {{have the option of}} wearing virtual reality headsets, which are attached to the restraints.|$|E

5|$|Side-mount {{cylinders}} are cylinders {{clipped to}} <b>the</b> <b>harness</b> at the diver's sides which carry bottom gas when the diver does not carry back mount cylinders. They {{may be used}} in conjunction with other side mounted stage, travel and/or decompression cylinders where necessary. Skilled side-mount divers may carry as many as three cylinders on each side. This configuration was developed for access through tight restrictions in caves. Side mounting is primarily used for technical diving, but is also sometimes used for recreational diving, when a single cylinder may be carried, complete with secondary second stage (octopus) regulator, in a configuration sometimes referred to as monkey diving.|$|E
5|$|The Magyars buried their dead, {{laying the}} {{deceased}} {{on their backs}} with the arms resting along their bodies or upon their pelvises. A deceased warrior's tomb always contained material connected with his horse. These are most frequently its skin, skull, and the lower legs; these were put into its master's grave, but occasionally only <b>the</b> <b>harness</b> was buried together with the warrior, or the horse's skin was stuffed with hay. The Magyars rolled the corpses in textiles or mats and placed silver plates on the eyes and the mouth.|$|E

Harnesses come in three main types: <b>the</b> freight <b>harness,</b> <b>the</b> H-back <b>harness,</b> and <b>the</b> X-back <b>harness.</b> Dog sports are growing and more types of harnesses are being developed, including the Y-back style and guard or distance harness. This type of harness is quickly becoming a favorite for those who enjoy skijoring.|$|R

5|$|The pony is {{typically}} a 2- to 5-litre cylinder. Its capacity determines {{the depth of}} dive and decompression duration for which it provides protection. Ponies may be fixed to the diver's buoyancy compensator (BC) or main cylinder behind the diver's back, or can be clipped to <b>the</b> <b>harness</b> at the diver's side or chest or carried as a sling cylinder. Ponies provide an accepted and reliable emergency gas supply but require that the diver is trained to use them.|$|E
5|$|After the event, in {{response}} to Owen Hart's death, the WWF canceled the encore presentation of Over the Edge via pay-per-view, and they also canceled four live events in Canada and one in Illinois. Information about Over the Edge from the WWF (now named the WWE) is sparse because the event was never released on VHS or DVD due to Hart's death. In 2014, the event was shown in an edited form on the WWE Network. On May 24, 1999, the day following this event, a tribute to Hart was held on Raw is War in St. Louis, which the WWF called Raw is Owen. For this show, all storylines and rivalries were stopped, and wrestlers were given the option to wrestle or not. The show also featured interviews and testimonies from his coworkers and highlights of his professional wrestling career. Hart's funeral service was held on May 31, 1999, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and it was attended by family members, friends, and over 300 wrestlers who were acquainted with him. Following the funeral, Hart was buried in Calgary's Queens Park Cemetery later that day. Three weeks after the event, his widow, children, and parents sued the WWF for causing Owen's death with a poorly planned stunt; they claimed that <b>the</b> <b>harness</b> system was defective. After the court case had extended one-and-a-half years, a settlement was reached on November 2, 2000, when the WWF agreed to pay his widow, children, and parents US$18million. The manufacturer of <b>the</b> <b>harness</b> system had also been named as a defendant in the case but was dismissed from the case after the settlement was reached.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{supplied}} divers {{are usually}} required to carry an emergency gas supply sufficient {{to allow them}} to return to a place of safety if the main gas supply fails. The usual configuration is a back mounted single cylinder supported by the diver's safety harness, with first stage regulator connected by a low-pressure hose to a bailout block, which may be mounted {{on the side of the}} helmet or band-mask or on <b>the</b> <b>harness</b> to supply a lightweight full-face mask. Where the capacity of a single cylinder in insufficient, plain manifolded twins or a rebreather may be used. For closed bell bounce and saturation dives the bailout set must be compact enough to allow the diver to pass through the bottom hatch of the bell. This sets a limit on the size of cylinders that can be used.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes in}} which Cole {{appeared}} on the ship were done by using a harness {{as if she was}} flying. Because the actress wore green dress and makeup, the normal greenscreen was replaced by bluescreens in the studio. Cole felt it was fun to fly on <b>the</b> <b>harness,</b> but found it painful after a few hours. Gillan was allowed to perform several of her own stunts in the episode. She was excited to learn that her character would fight pirates with swords, and was taught how to handle one with basic moves. Gillan was also allowed to swing across the ship. However, a stunt double was required to film the sequence where Amy is thrown across the deck by the Siren. The sickbay set was also built in a studio. Because the beds were attached to strings, they were prone to swaying. The cast members who were asked to lie on the beds were instructed to stay still and not breathe heavily to limit movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Sanchez's plane is hijacked was filmed on {{location}} in Florida, with stuntman Jake Lombard jumping from a helicopter to a plane and Dalton himself being filmed atop the aircraft. The plane towed by the helicopter was a life-sized model created by special effects supervisor John Richardson. After filming wide shots of David Hedison and Dalton parachuting, closer shots were made near the church location. During one of the takes, a malfunction of <b>the</b> <b>harness</b> equipment caused Hedison to fall on the pavement. The injury made him limp {{for the remainder of}} filming. The aquatic battle between Bond and the henchmen required two separate units, a surface one led by Arthur Wooster which used Dalton himself, and an underwater one which involved experienced divers. The barefoot waterskiing was done by world champion Dave Reinhart, with some close-ups using Dalton on a special rig. Milton Krest's death used a prosthetic head which was created by John Richardson's team based on a mould of Anthony Zerbe's face. The result was so gruesome that it was shortened and toned down to avoid censorship problems.|$|E
25|$|The diver {{and tender}} {{on the surface}} are {{connected}} by a rope lifeline and harness. <b>The</b> <b>harness</b> is typically put on over the dry suit but under the BC or other buoyancy device so that the diver remains tethered even {{if he or she}} must remove the air cylinder or buoyancy control device. <b>The</b> <b>harness</b> fits over the shoulders and around the back such that the tender on the surface can, in an emergency, haul an unconscious diver back to the hole. <b>The</b> <b>harness</b> should not be able to slide up or down the diver's torso when pulled in line with the body.|$|E

That clip is latched onto <b>the</b> <b>harnessed</b> tribe member and is wrapped around the said tribe member; only the Clipper is allowed to touch the cloth at all times. At {{the other end of}} the cloth is another clip to be latched on <b>the</b> next <b>harnessed</b> tribe member. <b>The</b> process is {{repeated}} in the next four poles until all five pieces of cloth are wrapped around <b>the</b> five <b>harnessed</b> tribe members. Afterwards, the pieces of cloth are unwrapped, unlatched from <b>the</b> <b>harnessed</b> tribe members, reconnected to each other, and spread out from the fifth pole back to the starting line by the clipper. The first tribe that has all five connected cloth pieces laid out and with all members on the tribal mat wins the Reward.|$|R
