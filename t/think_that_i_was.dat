When asked whether Jackie {{was done with}} the show, Thomas replied, [...] "She is. I would not hesitate for a second to have her come in to do an arc, but she will not be a series regular." [...] One notable recurring character absence in the finale is that of Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Ritter wanted to appear in the episode, but she was unable to do so because of scheduling conflicts. [...] "It was unfortunate for me that I couldn't be in the finale episode (I booked a pilot) because I was looking forward to showing how everything that went down affected her. On a side note, I did start to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> responsible for the crash. I really wanted her to be a bad guy." [...] She would later appear in the Veronica Mars movie.|$|E
500|$|When Johnston {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 1877, {{he was involved in}} the controversial Texas-Pacific Bill, a battle between Northern and Southern railroad interests. Johnston was opposed to Tom Scott's Texas and Pacific Railway, and the bill, which favored Scott's interests. Scott was trying to persuade Southern states to accept his railroad so that they would subsequently appoint senators who would vote for the bill. Johnston's seat was vulnerable if Scott succeeded in influencing the Virginia legislature, as it was known that he opposed the bill. As Johnston wrote in a letter, [...] "...what I have done about the Pacific road is before the people and I cannot recall it if I would. It would not be policy to retreat from my position nor am I inclined to do so, if was policy. I thought & I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> right & am therefore ready to take the consequences. I intend to fight it out on that line." [...] William Mahone worked to prevent his re-election. Most Southern states went along with Scott, but Virginia and Louisiana did not, and Johnston was re-elected.|$|E
2500|$|... "It is {{with great}} sorrow, that I must write you these lines. Yesterday {{we have lost}} our beloved son (Niels Peter Joensen) during a whaling in Sandvík. The sea was so rough that two boats capsized, 9 men on board one and 6 in the other. I was myself on board one of these boats and {{was the only one}} who got rescued. Several times I got loose of the boat and was deep down in the sea, but I kept {{grabbing}} the boat again. After a long time a boat came to rescue me. You must not <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just glad to be rescued. It was just because of Mariane (his wife) and the daughters. My brother Hans also died. All together 14 young men and boys like Peter. It is an unbelievable grief, both out where he used to work, and not at least here at home." ...|$|E

[...] "Do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{to be put}} off with such rubbish as <b>that?</b> <b>I</b> made all my {{arrangements}} long ago for when I found you. In {{less than an hour}} you will be in prison." ...|$|R

2500|$|Romoşan, who {{had earlier}} denied {{involvement}} with the Securitate, claimed that Negoiţescu had actually both been recruited as an agent since their release from prison in the 1960s, and had spied for the Securitate's foreign bureau during his time in Germany. Speaking after Corlăţan's article, he admitted having functioned as a Securitate informer, but not before 1987, when his wife, writer Adina Kenereş, was threatened with losing her travel privileges. He indicated that his signature on any other such documents was obtained {{with the use of}} violence and intimidation. He argued: [...] "I presently <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being used by the Securitate, which destroyed my reputation in order to provide Negoiţescu with a cover", and claims that Negoiţescu himself apologized to him for [...] "all the harm" [...] during a chance meeting in the early 1990s. According to Nistorescu's assessment: [...] "When the threads of Negoiţescu's file will come loose, perhaps I'll understand something from [...] adventure." [...] In contrast, Morar and Ştefan Agopian both assessed that Romoşan's own flight abroad was part of a Securitate diversion. Literary critic Dan C. Mihăilescu gave Romoşan's claims {{the benefit of the doubt}} and urged for the Negoiţescu file to be publicized in its entirety, but also asserted that Romoşan had lost his credibility.|$|E

At first they wanted to kill me, but let me go because they thought <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mad. Everyone <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> mad, Allan; {{it is a kind}} of public delusion, whereas <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sane and <b>that</b> most other people are mad." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That is why," [...] he added, [...] "it {{was painful}} {{to me to}} see you stand there before those men, {{answering}} their questions,--men whose walk in life was different, of an order removed from yours, who should not even have been permitted to approach you upon bended knees. Do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> suggesting any fault to you--do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> forcing your confidence in any way. But these are the thoughts which came to me only a little time ago." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Adrea, forgive me! Did you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going mad? I {{have had}} a terrible shock, and I have {{been up all night}} {{listening}} to a story which brings great suffering and misery upon me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't it? And it's quite true. That's the way {{we became}} Spooners. I never told her of it, but, somehow I wish I had now. It always seemed that she didn't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> anybody." ...|$|E
