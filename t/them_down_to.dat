5|$|O'Neill was {{replaced}} by former England under-21 coach Peter Taylor. During this time, one of Leicester's European appearances ended in a 3–1 defeat to Red Star Belgrade on 28 September 2000 in the UEFA Cup. Leicester began well under Taylor's management, topping the Premier League for {{two weeks in the}} autumn and remaining in contention for a European place for most of the campaign, before a late season collapse dragged <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a 13th-place finish.|$|E
5|$|If Magus {{joined the}} party, he departs {{to search for}} Schala. Crono's mother accidentally enters the time gate at the fair before it closes, {{prompting}} Crono, Marle, and Lucca to {{set out in the}} Epoch to find her while fireworks light up the night sky. Alternatively, if the party used the Epoch to break Lavos's outer shell, Marle will help her father hang Nadia's bell at the festival and accidentally get carried away by several balloons. Crono jumps on to help her, but cannot bring <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> earth. Hanging on in each other's arms, the pair travel through the cloudy, moonlit sky.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Second Chance round {{became a}} full semifinal, {{taking place in}} a venue {{comparable}} in size to those hosting the others. The expanded Second Chance takes place on a Saturday night, adding an extra week to the event's timetable. The format of voting also changed {{with the introduction of}} a knock-out system. The system pairs the eight songs off against each other, then narrows <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> four before pairing them off again. The winners of the two second round pairings go through to the final. The two finalists do not reprise their songs {{at the end of the}} programme.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the events}} of the series, the {{pioneering}} scientist Professor Humbert invented the Minimiser, a device capable of shrinking people or objects to one third of their original size. After Humbert's death, it was passed down to Father Unwin, who conceals his deceased parishioner's parting gift inside a copy of Milner's Gallery of Nature. The regular focus of the Minimiser is Harding, whom Unwin reduces to a height of two feet (0.6m) to enable him to infiltrate situations to which no ordinary-sized person could make a discreet entry. In this manner, the Harding puppet interacts with life-sized sets and live actors whose faces are excluded from shots. The Minimiser is also used to shrink enemy agents, literally bringing <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Harding's size.|$|E
5|$|The club {{made their}} first {{and so far}} only visit to Wembley Stadium on 9 May 1998, by winning through to {{the final of the}} FA Vase, under the {{management}} of Peter Quigley and his assistant Tony Heslop. They reached the final, beating Taunton Town 5–4 on aggregate in a two legged semi-final. In reaching the final, Tow Law, with its population of only 2,200, became the smallest town to ever reach a Wembley final. The team took around 4,000 supporters with <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> London, about twice the population of Tow Law at the time. They were beaten in the final 1–0 by Tiverton Town.|$|E
5|$|The main {{influence}} in fourteen-year-old Will Burrow's life is his father, Dr. Burrows, {{and together they}} share an interest in archaeology and a fascination for the buried past. When Dr. Burrows begins to notice strange 'pallid men' where they live in Highfield, and then promptly goes missing, Will and his friend Chester go search for him. They discover a blocked passageway behind bookshelves in the cellar of the Burrows home and re-excavate it, finding the passage leads to a door set into the rock, and beyond the door is an old lift that takes <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> another set of doors. A cobblestone street lies beyond, lit by a row of orb-like street lamps; houses {{that appear to be}} carved out of the walls themselves flank the street.|$|E

5|$|Prey is {{obtained}} by hunting {{either on the}} ground or in the trees. During the non-breeding season the fossa hunts individually, but during the breeding season hunting parties may be seen, and these may be pairs or later on mothers and young. One member of the group scales a tree and chases the lemurs from tree to tree, forcing <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the ground where the other is easily able to capture them. The fossa is known to eviscerate its larger lemur prey, a trait that, along with its distinct scat, helps identify its kills. Long-term observations of the fossa's predation patterns on rainforest sifakas suggest that the fossa hunts in a subsection of their range until prey density is decreased, then moves on. The fossa has been reported to prey on domestic animals, such as goats and small calves, and especially chickens. Food taken in captivity includes amphibians, birds, insects, reptiles, and small- to medium-sized mammals.|$|E
5|$|The {{first night}} of February saw Arsenal host Manchester United at Highbury. In the tunnel before the match Roy Keane was seen confronting Vieira; the United captain accused him of intimidating his {{teammate}} Gary Neville. Vieira scored after eight minutes, but Giggs equalised for Manchester United 10 minutes later. Bergkamp restored Arsenal’s advantage nine minutes before half time, but two goals by Cristiano Ronaldo and one by John O'Shea {{in the second half}} gave United a 4–2 win. It was Arsenal's fourth league defeat of the season and moved <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> third spot, overtaken by their opponents. Wenger ruled his team out of the title race and refused to blame Almunia for his error in Ronaldo's first goal. The goalkeeper was dropped in Arsenal's next game, away to Aston Villa. Three first half goals by Ljungberg, Henry and Cole gave Arsenal a comfortable win.|$|E

25|$|Although the Vikings {{held the}} wind {{advantage}} {{again during the}} final quarter, the Giants defense managed to shut <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> preserve the victory. The Vikings had a great chance {{to tie the game}} when Carter caught a deep pass from backup quarterback Sean Salisbury and appeared to be {{on his way to a}} sure touchdown, but safety Myron Guyton caught up with him from behind and knocked the ball out of his hands. Jackson recovered it for the Giants on the Vikings 15-yard line to put the game away.|$|E

25|$|The {{population}} in Middle Village has been historically German American. Later, it became Irish American, Italian American, and Yugoslavian-American, although Middle Village has seen {{an influx of}} Polish people, Eastern Europeans, Hispanic Americans, and Chinese Americans (mostly in South Elmhurst, after a ZIP code change in the early 2000s). Many of the older families have left Middle Village but have not sold their homes but rather passed <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> their children; the result is many second and third generation residents. The population of Middle Village has been relatively consistent: 28,984 in 2000, compared to 28,981 in 1990.|$|E
25|$|KSC {{finished}} {{fifth in}} their first season in the 2. Bundesliga after relegation, only two points behind third-place SSV Ulm 1846 which was promoted to the Bundesliga. However, a last place finish in a terrible 1999–2000 season played under dire financial circumstances dropped <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Regionalliga Süd (III). The club rebounded and {{on the strength of}} a first-place result in the Regionalliga made a prompt return to second division play. After four seasons of mediocre play that saw KSC narrowly avoid being sent further down, the team turned in a much-improved performance and earned a sixth-place result in 2005–06.|$|E
25|$|Fresh {{off their}} {{stunning}} upset of the top-seeded Dallas Mavericks, the Golden State Warriors faced {{a very different}} team in Utah. The Warriors continued the frantic style of play they exhibited against the Mavericks, but the Jazz, a more defensive-minded team, managed to shut <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> take Game 1. The Warriors tried to bounce back in Game 2, and took the Jazz to overtime. But the Jazz were able to prevail, due to the inspired clutch play of guard Derek Fisher, who arrived at halftime after being {{with his family in}} New York City because of his daughter's emergency eye cancer surgery.|$|E

25|$|Ever since, the {{definition}} of the canon has been a collective endeavor that involved several generations of European architects, from Renaissance and Baroque periods, basing their theories both on the study of Vitruvius' writings and the observation of Roman ruins (the Greek ruins became available only after Greek Independence, 1821–23). What was added were rules {{for the use of the}} Architectural Orders, and the exact proportions of <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the most minute detail. Commentary on the appropriateness of the orders for temples devoted to particular deities (Vitruvius I.2.5) were elaborated by Renaissance theorists, with Doric characterized as bold and manly, Ionic as matronly, and Corinthian as maidenly.|$|E
25|$|The {{years of}} {{dictatorship}} were gruesome.

It is said that a student dared a policeman to get his shoes and feet wet chasing after a cigarette lighter, thrown in the duck pond, while he had the license for it in his pocket. In those days one needed a permit to own a cigarette lighter, as imposed by Salazar to protect the matches industry.|$|E

Khan's Kent Spitfires had batted first, however, and 59 not out from left-hander Michael Carberry lifted them to a total of 154 for 4, while Andre Adams shone on the bowling front for Essex with two for 12 off three overs. However, the Spitfires kept firing dangerous balls at the Eagles, and eventually shot <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 149 for 7 - Mark Pettini making 60 in vain before he was run out, while Andrew Hall took two for 30 for Kent.|$|E
