5|$|The British rock {{movement}} {{known as}} {{the new wave of}} British heavy metal (frequently abbreviated in NWOBHM), which started in the late 1970s and broke in the mainstream in the early 1980s, was just exploding in the United Kingdom and the band gained the support of a strong label at exactly the right time to exploit <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> form a solid fan base.|$|E
5|$|Whedon {{was also}} keen on {{utilizing}} vertical space; thus, having the crew's quarters accessible by ladder was important. Another {{benefit of the}} set design was that it also allowed the actors to stay in <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> interact, without having to stop after each shot and reset up for the next. This helped contribute to the documentary style Whedon strove for.|$|E
5|$|Most of Caragiale's prose is {{interconnected}} through {{allusions to}} himself, and, occasionally, the narratives discreetly refer to one another. Although his texts {{are characterized by}} precision in defining <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> location for the plot, the general lines of the narratives are often subject to a calculated fragmentation, an innovative technique which, Vartic writes, attests the author's familiarity with Antoine Furetière's vision. Vartic also indicates that Balzac's La Comédie humaine, in particular its Thirteen cycle—which {{is known to have}} been one of the books Caragiale treasured most—, influenced the general structure of his stories.|$|E

5|$|The {{president}} Cristina Fernández de Kirchner {{was out of}} {{the country}} at <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>and</b> although she arranged an early return, she could not return to the country in time for the funeral. As a result, the vice president Julio Cobos arranged the state funeral of Alfonsín, alongside Eduardo Fellner (president of the Chamber of deputies) and José Pampuro (acting president of the Senate). His widow, former First Lady of Argentina María Lorenza Barreneche, was unable to attend her husband's public state funeral due to her own declining health.|$|E
5|$|These successes enabled Emperor Constantine V (741–775) {{to shift}} the fleet from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea during his campaigns against the Bulgars in the 760s. In 763, a fleet of 800 ships {{carrying}} 9,600 cavalry and some infantry sailed to Anchialus, where he scored a significant victory, but in 766, a second fleet, allegedly of 2,600 ships, again bound for Anchialus, sank en route. At the same time however, the Isaurian emperors undermined Byzantium's naval strength: with the Arab threat gone for <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>and</b> with the largely iconodule naval themes staunchly opposed to their iconoclastic policies, the emperors reduced the navy's size and downgraded the naval themes.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín died {{at home on}} 31March 2009, {{at the age of}} 82, {{after being}} {{diagnosed}} a year before with lung cancer. The streets around his house at the Santa Fe avenue were filled with hundreds of people, who started a candlelight vigil. The radical Julio Cobos, Fernández de Kirchner's vice president, was the acting president at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> ordered three days of national mourning. There was a ceremony in the Congress, where his body was displayed in the Blue Hall, that was attended by almost a thousand people. His widow María Lorenza Barreneche could not attend the funeral, because of her own poor health. It was attended by former presidents Carlos Menem, Fernando delaRúa, Eduardo Duhalde and Néstor Kirchner, {{all the members of the}} Supreme Court of Argentina, mayor Mauricio Macri, governor Daniel Scioli, the president of Uruguay Tabaré Vázquez and several other politicians. The coffin was moved to La Recoleta Cemetery. He was placed next to the graves of other important historical figures of the UCR, such as Leandro N. Alem, Hipólito Yrigoyen and Arturo Illia.|$|E

5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E

Holland reigned supreme within the Republic for <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>and</b> Holland's commerce was not really damaged {{by the fact that}} England maintained its Navigation Acts (England not being an essential market for the Amsterdam Entrepôt).
