5000|$|On Broadway, Fred Barton was Associate Conductor of the 1987 {{revival of}} [...] "Cabaret", {{directed}} by Hal Prince and starring Joel Grey, Regina Resnik, and Werner Klemperer. He {{also served as}} Associate Conductor of [...] "Zorba", starring Anthony Quinn, {{as well as the}} national touring production of [...] "Camelot", starring Robert Goulet, and the Los Angeles and national touring productions of [...] "City of Angels."

60|$|BLANCO. He's a sly one. He's a mean one. He lies low for you. He plays cat {{and mouse}} with you. He lets you run loose until you <b>think</b> <b>youre</b> shut of him; and then, when you least expect it, he's got you.|$|E
60|$|SAVOYARD. Well, Vaughan has {{no sense}} of humor; and if you joke with him he'll <b>think</b> <b>youre</b> {{insulting}} him on purpose. Mind: it's not that he doesnt see a joke: he does; and it hurts him. A comedy scene makes him sore all over: he goes away black and blue, and pitches into the play for all hes worth.|$|E
50|$|I {{would hope}} that people, no matter what age, would find {{something}} to identify with in my books, pick up one and experience a personal sense of discovery. Thats great. I <b>think</b> that if <b>youre</b> a creative person, you should just go about your business, do your work and not care about how its received. I never read reviews because {{if you believe the}} good ones you have to believe the bad ones too. Not that I dont care about success. I do, but only because it lets me do what I want. I was always prepared for success but that means that I have to be prepared for failure too. I have an ego, I have ideas, I want to be articulate, to communicate but in my own way. People who say they create only for themselves and dont care if they are published... I hate to hear talk like that. If its good, its too good not to share. Thats the way I feel about my work. So Ill keep on communicating, but only my way. Lots of things I wont do. I wont go on television because who am I talking to? Johnny Carson? The camera? Twenty million people I cant see? Uh-uh. And I wont give any more interviews.|$|R

5000|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} titled [...] "Dance Your Love Away", {{and was given}} to American artist, Michael Prince, to record. When Hazell Dean contacted Stock Aitken Waterman, they offered her {{to listen to the}} backing track of Divines [...] "You <b>Think</b> <b>Youre</b> A Man". She liked it, so she needed a single with them. Matt Aitken came up with idea of using the backing track of [...] "Dance Your Love Away [...] " [...] with re-written lyrics, which could be suitable for Hazell, who hated the chorus. Mike Stock and Matt Aitken rewrote it, with the song being re-titled [...] "Whatever I Do (Wherever I Go)". [...] "Dance Your Love Away" [...] was released as a single in 1985.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{the routine}} weather reports {{indicated}} seasonably mild and breezy weather with light flurries, the low-slung Arlington - having only 3.5 feet of freeboard when fully loaded - was being boarded occasionally by heavy seas. First mate Junis Macksey, a veteran ships master {{in his own}} right, had instructed the wheelsman to follow a course along {{the north shore of}} Lake Superior, where the ship would be sheltered from the worst of the wind and waves, but where progress would be slower and less direct on its way to Whitefish Bay. Captain Burke countermanded the order, and the more direct course away from shore was resumed. First mate Macksey is said to have commented to Burke, [...] "You just <b>think</b> <b>youre</b> going to Whitefish." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Predrag Popovićs book Oni ne prastaju (written {{from the}} authors {{subsequent}} interviews with Ćuruvija), Ćuruvija was shouting: [...] "What {{the hell do}} you <b>think</b> <b>youre</b> doing. If you continue down this crazy path, you can be sure youll all be hanging off lamp posts in Terazije". Visibly flustered, Mira reportedly responded: [...] "How can you say that Slavko, after all weve allowed you". Slavkos later comment was also published in the book: [...] "Evidently she thought shed done me a great favour by allowing me to live a normal life and publish newspapers all those years". The meeting, their last ever, ended with Ćuruvija saying: [...] "Say hello to your husband for me." [...] To which a visibly shook up Mira responded: [...] "I will not do that, but I will tell him everything you said." [...] People who {{happened to be in the}} building said Mira Marković was crying after the meeting.|$|E
5000|$|In 1936, Prokofiev and {{his family}} settled {{permanently}} in Moscow, after shifting {{back and forth between}} Moscow and Paris for the previous four years. That year he composed one of his most famous works, Peter and the Wolf, for Natalya Satss Central Childrens Theatre. Sats also persuaded Prokofiev to write two songs for children, [...] "Sweet Song", and [...] "Chatterbox"; they were eventually joined by [...] "The Little Pigs" [...] and published as Three Childrens Songs, Op. 68. Prokofiev also composed the gigantic Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution, originally intended for performance during the anniversary year but effectively blocked by Kerzhentsev, who demanded at the works audition before the Committee on Arts Affairs, [...] "Just what do you <b>think</b> <b>youre</b> doing, Sergey Sergeyevich, taking texts that belong to the people and setting them to such incomprehensible music?" [...] The Cantata had to wait until 5 April 1966 for a partial premiere, just over 13 years after the composers death.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, the Simpsons {{walk out}} of the church and notice that the Apocalypse has begun. While the other family members are left on earth, Lisa at first starts {{ascending}} into Heaven, but Homer stops her by grabbing her leg and says [...] "Where do you <b>think</b> <b>youre</b> going, missy?" [...] The gag was written by staff writer George Meyer, and is series creator Matt Groenings favorite joke of the series. While the episodes ending is one of Groenings favorites, fans were uneasy with it. Selman stated that the ending [...] "drives them fans crazy", since they do not know whether or not the episode is canonical. In 2007, Homers line [...] "Oh, I smell barbeque!" [...] was included in Bobby Bryant of The States list [...] "20 Essential Things Ive Learned From Homer Simpson". The same year, the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma, unveiled a new exhibit which galleried Biblical images in art and pop culture, including a promotional poster for [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories".|$|E
5000|$|Blink-182 {{partnered with}} AT&T to release an {{unofficial}} music video for [...] "Up All Night" [...] August 2, 2011, a montage compiled from fan-made YouTube videos that used the bands music illegally. After an online search of over 14,000 videos, several were compiled {{to create the}} montage, presented as [...] "The Blink-182 film festival you didnt know you entered". The videos description read [...] "To launch our first single in eight years, AT&T helped us search YouTube for every instance of fans using our music without our permission. And then we rewarded them for it. This film {{is made out of}} clips from all those videos. Thanks for being a fan." [...] Released August 2, 2011, it features skateboarders doing tricks and amateur musicians playing along to the bands songs. Devin Brown of CBS News compared the video to Radioheads marketing strategy, in that the band [...] "rewarded the illegal use of their music, and in turn promoted their new music. Its a smart move for the band that has been forcibly absent from the music scene since disbanding in 2005." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Ashley Fetters said that it [...] "functions as a tongue-in-cheek thank-you note to their generation-Napster fan base: It’s a wry, affectionate montage". Rolling Stone called it [...] "silly and tongue-in-cheek, but pointed: If you <b>think</b> <b>youre</b> allowed to do whatever you want with their copyrighted works, they should be obliged to do the same with yours." ...|$|E
5000|$|More than 6 {{million viewers}} tuned {{in for the}} episode in the UK. The lunchtime showing {{attracted}} 3.15 million viewers, giving the show a 44.1% audience share. The evening showing managed a small increase to 3.48 million and a 23.2% audience share. [...] "So. You <b>think</b> <b>youre</b> getting a contemporary episode starring Harold and Paul {{and a bunch of}} nine-year-olds - when suddenly a load of characters from yesteryear show up, thanks to an improbable storyline in which glamorous former resident Annalise, now a famous film-maker, returns to screen her documentary about Ramsay Street." [...] —Charlie Brooker, The Guardian, 15 October 2005 Reviews for the episode were mixed. Graeme Whitfield, writing for the Western Mail, was disappointed with the reunion and the returning characters. He quipped [...] "Neighbours celebrated its anniversary earlier this year by bringing back all the star names from its illustrious past. Except it didnt. It brought back Lance and Phil Martin, who, lets face it, were always rubbish. Of course, I didnt expect Kylie, Guy Pearce or Natalie Imbruglia to go back to Ramsay Street now that they are big stars. ... But surely they could have found Clive (Geoff Paine) or Henry (Craig McLachlan), who have done pretty much nothing since they left Erinsborough in the late 1980s?" [...] Whitfield thought the episode had started well with the return of Joe Mangel and Harolds reaction to his reappearance, but soon realised that the episode would [...] "end in disappointment." ...|$|E
5000|$|In June 2007, {{based on}} his New York City audition, Tidwell was asked {{directly}} to Las Vegas callbacks without a second audition. [...] Quickly, however, judges such as contemporary dance choreographer Mia Michaels and hip hop choreographer Shane Sparks, found Tidwell to be arrogant, with the latter saying Tidwell acted {{as if he were}} [...] "Gods gift to the world." [...] The allegation was a recurring issue throughout the show, and Tidwell found his reputation as a gifted dancer at odds with his aloof demeanor. Nigel Lythgoe (head judge and executive producer) for his part found the accusations tiresome, responding to choreographer Adam Shankmans comment on Tidwells arrogance with, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>youre</b> talking crap." [...] The New York Times, in an article titled [...] "So He Knows He Can Dance: A Prince Among Paupers", praised the technically talented Tidwell, and noted that [...] "his unflinching poise and his chiseled, determined jaw" [...] can be misread on television. The article continued, [...] "If Mr. Tidwell is different from the other dancers on the show, the distinction has {{as much to do with}} his dignity as with his impeccable line and his ability to infuse slight choreography with authority...He never mugs for the camera. Its sad, yet hardly a surprise, that such behavior could be taken as superciliousness." [...] The aforementioned Sparks later retracted his previous statement and said Tidwell could [...] "be one of the greats." ...|$|E
