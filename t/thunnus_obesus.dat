5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the night shark globally as Vulnerable, citing its slow reproductive rate and historical declines under fishing pressure. It {{has also been}} listed as Vulnerable by the American Fisheries Society (AFS). This species was once {{a significant part of}} the Cuban artisanal shark fishery, comprising 6075% of the catch from 1937 to 1941, before its numbers dropped substantially in the 1970s. Similarly, the proportion of night sharks in the shark catch of the southeastern U.S. pelagic longline fishery fell from 26.1% from 1981 to 1983 to 0.33.3% in 1993 and 1994; a comparable decline was observed in catches by south Florida marlin tournaments since the 1970s. Currently, the intense Brazilian targeted fishery is of particular concern, although fishing pressure on the night shark may be relaxing as the fishery is beginning to shift towards swordfish and bigeye tuna (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>obesus).</b> No fishery information on the night shark is available for the eastern Atlantic, leading to an IUCN assessment of Data Deficient for that region.|$|E

Like {{other members of}} its family, this species is {{viviparous}} with the developing embryos sustained to term by yolk. Adult females have two functional ovaries and two functional uteri. Two of the recorded female specimens contained 25 and 26 mature ova; in the related black dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii), the number of mature ova in a female is slightly greater {{than the number of}} resulting embryos, which suggests a litter size under 26 in the viper dogfish.

2500|$|There are no {{accurate}} size {{data collected}} on the catches from fishing, aside from limited port sampling by the National Marine Fisheries Service. However, {{it is known that}} the largest percent of the catches are juvenile tuna between 10 and 35 pounds. These fish are probably somewhere between one and two years of age, well below sexual maturity. [...] Fishermen report that the offshore fishing grounds are productive year-round. However, during summer months, large Yellowfin tuna are more abundant. The weight of the catches are estimated to be about 75% <b>Thunnus</b> <b>obesus</b> (Bigeye tuna), and 25% T. albacares (Yellowfin tuna). According to estimates, about 1 million pounds of Bigeye tuna and 400,000 pounds of Yellowfin were fished from offshore operations from the region in 1995. The amount of tuna is thought to depend on conditions on the seamount, and on the current process range of the tuna schools.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{study reveals}} the food {{composition}} of pelagic fishes {{living in the}} southwestern Atlantic Ocean. As such more common pelagic species {{are considered to be}} top predators, the study proposes to know what constitutes their main food. Fish are not commonly found within their stomach contents, but instead, cephalopods are their most common food. As can be observed, Teuthida cephalopods compose their principal diet. The stomach contents of specimens of Xiphias gladius, <b>Thunnus</b> albacares, T. <b>obesus,</b> T. alalunga, Isurus oxyrinchus and Alopias superciliosus caught during July 2007 to June 2009 by using tuna longliners were studied. Teuthida cephalopods constitute the main food item for the three tuna species, while X. gladius feeds mainly on Ommastrephidae cephalopods. Though the differences among the kinds of cephalopods exist, they constitute the principal resource these fish use to live at least in the southern Atlantic Ocean...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} and conservation of large pelagic fish commonly rely on fisheries data and thus crucially depend on {{our understanding of}} the fish response to the fishing gear. Stock assessment of both tropical and temperate tuna strongly leans on the catch statistics derived from pelagic longline ?sheries. However, the role of the spatial distribution of catches of tuna and bycatch species over the gear, that can affect the estimated tuna abundance, is still neglected. In this study, we analyzed data obtained from 147 instrumented pelagic longline sets equipped with hook timers and temperature depth recorders to characterize the distribution of hooking contacts and success at a fine temporal and spatial scale. Scientific surveys were carried out in the Central-South Pacific Ocean (French Polynesia), targeting tropical (<b>Thunnus</b> albacares, T. <b>obesus)</b> and temperate (T. alalunga) tuna. Data analysis based on spatial point processes and stochastic modeling demonstrate the presence of spatio-temporal clusters for both hooking contacts and hooking success. The comparative analysis of the observed spatio-temporal patterns for different oceanographic zones revealed the persistent structure of the clusters, suggesting that they are neither related to local environmental conditions nor to the spatial distribution of preys...|$|R

40|$|Bigeye tuna (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>obesus)</b> have {{distinctive}} depth distributions {{and vertical}} movement patterns. They {{remain in the}} uniformed temperature surface layer at night and can descend to greater than 500 m depth at dawn. They thus mirror the vertical migrations of the small nektonic organisms of the deep sound scattering layer and extensively exploit these as a food resource. At their maximum depths, bigeye tuna frequently experience prolonged exposure to ambient temperatures (. 5 EC) that are up to 20 EC colder than surface layer temperature, and oxygen concentrations less than 1. 5 ml O 2 l- 1. In contrast, skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin tuna (T. albacares) generally limit their forays to depths where water temperatures {{are no more than}} 8 EC below surface layer temperatures, and ambient oxygen levels are above 3. 5 ml O 2 l- 1.
