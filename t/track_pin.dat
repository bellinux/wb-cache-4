40|$|The goal of {{the overall}} {{internship}} opportunity this semester was to learn and practice the elements of engineering design through direct exposure to real engineering problems. The primary exposure was to design and manufacture an airbrake device for use with small-medium scale rocket applications. The idea {{was to take the}} presented concept of a solution and transform said concept into a reliable fully-functioning and reusable mechanism. The mechanism was to be designed as an insurance feature so that the overall altitude of a rocket with relatively undetermined engine capabilities does not unexpectedly exceed the imposed 10, 000 foot ceiling, per range requirements. The airbrake concept was introduced to the Prototype Development Lab as a rotation-driven four tiered offset <b>track</b> <b>pin</b> mechanism, i. e. the airbrake was deployed by rotating a central shaft attached directly to the bottom plate. The individual airbrake fins were subsequently deployed using multiple plates with tracks of offset curvature. The fins were created with guide pins to follow the tracks in each of the offset plates, thus allowing the simultaneous rotational deployment of all fins by only rotating one plate. The concept of this solution was great; though it did not function in application. The rotating plates alone brought up problems like the entire back half of the rocket rotating according to the motion of the aforementioned base plate. Subsequently, the solution currently under development became a static linear actuator-driven spring-loaded fin release system. This solution is almost instantaneously triggered electronically when the avionics detect that the rocket has reached the calculated altitude of deceleration. This altitude will allow enough time remaining to the overall ceiling to adequately decelerate the rocket prior to reaching the ceiling...|$|E
40|$|Very {{often the}} <b>track</b> <b>pins</b> of {{heavy-loaded}} track-type machines have insufficient fatigue safety margin, which causes their frequent breakage. One {{of the most}} rational solutions {{of the problem is}} the use of the high-temperature thermomechanical treatment of hot-rolled tubular billets for <b>track</b> <b>pins.</b> The analysis of the investigation results and engineering developments shows the possibility of improving the performance characteristic of hollow items (shafts, axis <b>pins,</b> <b>track</b> <b>pins</b> for a caterpillar mover, torsion suspensions of an undercarriage, etc.) by combining the thermomechanical treatment strengthening, various methods for improving the quality of the surface of tubular billets and the application of developed technological schemes in the factories producing tubular billets and items with diameter of Ø 10 ÷ 60 mm and the parameters of safety margin, precision and roughness required for the durability of the items...|$|R
30|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis {{remains a}} common {{complication}} {{with the use}} of external fixators [35, 36]. Quoted incidences range from 11.3 to 100  % [37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. Fortunately, the majority of these infections are minor and easily treated with local <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care and oral antibiotics [42]. Intra-operative pin insertion methods that emphasize low energy insertion and a standardized post-operative <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care protocol {{have been shown to be}} effective in reducing the incidence and severity of pin tract sepsis [43]. These strategies should be instituted for all patients who undergo external fixator application. In our series, only one patient developed a major <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection that required removal of the external fixator. Ten patients had minor <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis that responded to local treatment and oral antibiotics. It is interesting to note that HIV infection had no influence on the incidence or severity of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis, while five out of six patients who smoked developed <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis.|$|R
3000|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis is {{a common}} {{complication}} of circular external fixation. HIV status has been implicated as an independent risk factor {{for the development of}} <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection and has been cited as a reason not to attempt complex limb reconstruction in HIV-positive patients. This retrospective review of patients treated with circular external fixators looked at the incidence of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis in HIV-positive, HIV-negative and patients whose HIV status was unknown. The records of 229 patients, 40 of whom were HIV-positive, were reviewed. The overall incidence of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis was 22.7  %. HIV infection did not affect the incidence of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis (p =  0.9). The severity of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis was not influenced by HIV status (p =  0.9) or CD 4 count (p =  0.2). With the employment of meticulous pin insertion techniques and an effective postoperative <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care protocol, circular external fixation can be used safely in HIV-positive individuals.|$|R
30|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>track</b> {{infection}} {{decreases the}} stability of the pin–bone interface. Conversely, instability of the fixator pin–bone construct can lead to half-pin loosening and infection [3]. It is a common misconception that pin loosening only results from <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection when in actual fact pin loosening is often the initiating event resulting in <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis.|$|R
30|$|The use of meticulous pin {{insertion}} {{techniques and}} {{the implementation of}} an evidence-based <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care protocol can {{reduce the incidence of}} <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis with circular external fixation in reconstructive surgery to approximately 25  % [4]. Our results compare favorably to previously published figures with an overall <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis incidence of 22.7  % (52 out of 229) observed in this series.|$|R
30|$|This article aims to {{highlight}} the factors {{associated with an increased}} risk of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> complications, reviews the literature and proposes a protocol for effective external fixator <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care.|$|R
3000|$|Major <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infections, Checketts grade 4 and above, {{should be}} managed in theatre {{in order to}} allow {{adequate}} debridement of the <b>pin</b> <b>tracks.</b> Morgan-Jones [37] recommends arthroscopic debridement of major <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection to remove all necrotic debris. Bibbo [2] [...] on the other hand, uses the Versajet Hydrosurgery system (Smith & Nephew, Memphis, TN) to debride infected pin sites after which the wound edges are freshened and closed with nylon or polypropolene sutures.|$|R
30|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis {{is often}} the first {{clinical}} manifestation of a vicious cycle of pin loosening and sustained pin site infection. It is a misconception that <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis result in pin loosening; pin loosening is more often the inciting event that leads to pin site infection [14, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Failure of the pin–bone interface can have catastrophic consequences and may lead to failure of the reconstruction and, ultimately, limb ablation in some. A meticulous approach to pin and wire insertion combined with a structured protocol of pin site care {{has been shown to}} decrease the incidence of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis [4, 20, 21]. Certain patient factors may, however, influence the incidence and severity of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis. Poor diabetic control and HIV infection have both been implicated as independent risk factors for the development of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection [7, 15, 22, 23, 24].|$|R
30|$|Several {{factors have}} been implicated in the {{development}} of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis [4, 21]. They include frame design and biomechanics, pin and wire insertion techniques, point of commencement of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care and the specific care protocol employed [7, 8, 12, 13, 40]. Strategies to reduce <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis should include measures aimed at optimization of these factors. Some non-modifiable risk factors have also been associated with pin site infection. These include diabetes mellitus and HIV infection [7, 15, 22, 23, 24].|$|R
30|$|This {{retrospective}} review aims {{to compare}} the rate and severity of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients treated with circular external fixators. The research proposal was reviewed {{and approved by the}} local ethics committee. An extensive literature review revealed this current study to be the largest yet {{to compare the}} incidence of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. It is currently also the only study investigating the effect of HIV infection on the incidence and severity of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis with the use of circular external fixators.|$|R

30|$|The {{appropriate}} time to commence <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care vary greatly {{in the literature}} with published times ranging from 24  h to 10  days [2, 3, 5, 10, 27, 28, 29, 31]. The frequency of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> cleaning also differ, with authors suggesting once daily [6, 27], twice daily [3, 4], weekly [27, 33] or ‘when required’ [28].|$|R
30|$|The {{most common}} {{complication}} was <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection (82 %). There was no {{consensus in the}} literature regarding how to manage <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection of the wires and half pins of the external fixators [24]. Hydroxyapatite-coated pins may reduce the rate of infection; however, we used hydroxyapatite-coated half pins in only three patients due to financial reasons.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, while <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis is {{a common}} {{complication}} {{with the use of}} circular external fixators, we did not find that the incidence or severity of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis was influenced by HIV infection or degree of immune compromise. This finding should not preclude the use of circular external fixators for complex trauma and limb reconstruction in HIV-positive individuals.|$|R

30|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>track</b> {{infection}} is an inherent problem in external fixation. There were 58 <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infections. There were three cases of osteomyelitis, but all in open fractures. Forty-three pin infections were managed successfully with antibiotics, while in 15 (7 patients) the pin {{had to be}} replaced. In the three cases of osteomyelitis, intravenous antibiotic treatment was combined with debridement of all necrotic tissue. All infections eventually resolved.|$|R
30|$|A {{retrospective}} {{review was}} undertaken and the variables recorded included patient demographics, HIV status, CD 4 count {{and use of}} antiretroviral medication, indications for circular fixation, type of external fixator used, <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> complications and treatment of these complications. Results were analyzed using the independent t test, one-way ANOVA test and the Kruskal–Wallis H test to ascertain whether HIV infection had any effect on the incidence or severity on <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis.|$|R
50|$|Tiger I tanks {{needed a}} high degree of support. It {{required}} two or sometimes three of the standard German Sd.Kfz. 9 Famo heavy recovery half-track tractors to tow it. Tiger crews often resorted to using another Tiger to tow the damaged vehicle, but this was not recommended as it often caused overheating and engine breakdown. The low-mounted sprocket limited the obstacle clearance height. The tracks also had a tendency to override the rear sprocket, resulting in immobilisation. If a track overrode and jammed, two Tigers were normally needed to tow the tank. The jammed track was also a big problem itself, since due to high tension, it was often impossible to split the track by removing the <b>track</b> <b>pins.</b> The <b>track</b> sometimes had to be blown apart with a small explosive charge.|$|R
30|$|Pin track-associated {{complications}} {{are almost}} universal findings {{with the use}} of external fixation. These complications are catastrophic if it leads to the failure of the bone–pin interface and could lead to pin loosening, fracture non-union and chronic osteomyelitis. Strategies proposed for the prevention and management of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> complications are diverse and constantly changing. Prevention of external fixation <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection is a complex and ongoing task that requires attention to detail, meticulous surgical technique and constant vigilance.|$|R

30|$|HIV {{infection}} {{has prompted}} many orthopedic and trauma surgeons {{to avoid the}} use of circular external fixators {{for the purpose of}} limb reconstruction in HIV-positive patients. Norrish and Harrison published the first data comparing <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection with the use of monolateral external fixators in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients [22, 24, 39]. They reported on 13 HIV-positive and 34 HIV-negative patients and found significantly more infections requiring pharmaceutical or surgical intervention in the HIV-positive group. Our results differ in that we could show no correlation between the incidence or severity of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> sepsis and HIV status. Our results do correlate with the findings of no correlation between CD 4 count and the severity of <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection in HIV-positive patients. The low patient numbers and wide CD 4 range could explain the apparent lack of relationship and more research is required.|$|R
30|$|We {{advocate}} that <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care is restarted {{as soon as}} {{pin site}} infection is identified. This includes twice daily cleaning of the pin–skin interface with a chlorhexidine solution and absorbent dressings if excessive exudate is encountered. A course of oral antibiotics aimed at Staphylococcal infection is prescribed for 7 – 10  days. Checketts grade 3 infections are admitted for intravenous antibiotics and in-hospital <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care and limb elevation. If these infections do not respond adequately, the involved pins or wires are removed or exchanged.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{clinical}} benefits {{of stainless steel}} (SS) to titanium (Ti) on reducing <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> irritation/infection and <b>pin</b> loosening during external fracture fixation. Methods: A tibial gap osteotomy was created in 17 sheep and stabilized with four Schanz screws of either SS or Ti and an external fixation frame. Over the 12 week observation period, pin loosening was assessed by grading the radiolucency around the pins and measuring the extraction torque on pin removal at sacrifice. Irritation/infection was assessed with weekly clinical <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> grading. A histological analysis of the tissue adjacent to the pin site was made to assess biocompatibility. Results: A statistically non-significant trend for less bone resorption around Ti pins was found during the early observation period. However, at sacrifice, {{there was no difference}} between the two materials. Also, there was no difference in the extraction torque, and there was similar remodeling and apposition of the bone around the pins. A statistically non-significant trend for more infection about SS pins at sacrifice was found. Histology showed a slightly higher prevalence of reactionary cells in SS samples, but was otherwise not much different than around Ti pins. Conclusions: There is no clinically relevant substantial advantage in using either SS or Ti pins on reducing pin loosening or <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> irritation/infection...|$|R

40|$|In this {{retrospective}} study 29 dogs {{of both sexes}} of several breeds, were evaluated. Complications of external skeletal fixation were common. The most frequent post-surgical complications were chronic <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> drainage or <b>pin</b> loosing (11; 37. 9 %), followed by dry crust at the skin-to-pin interface (5; 17. 1 %). In five cases (17. 1 %) occurred the healing of the fracture without complications. In three dogs (10. 4 %) occurred nonunion and it was used another fixation method. It was observed individual cases of poor limb use (3. 5 %) or breakage of the pin (3. 5 %) or of the acrylic column (3. 5 %). <b>Pin</b> <b>track</b> drainage or loosing {{was related to the}} owners care. The most did not come back to the hospital as was demanded or did not follow the instructions to inspect the apparatus daily. This behaviour contributed to increase the rate of post-surgical complications. The external fixation has the advantage to be less invasive and can be used to treat closed and open fractures, limb deformities, nonunion and infected fractures...|$|R
30|$|Another {{important}} {{preventative measure}} involves post-operative limb elevation. We advocate limb elevation whenever {{the patient is}} not actively mobilizing. This reduces oedema around the pins and creates the optimal environment for rapid healing of the <b>pin</b> <b>tracks</b> [2].|$|R
30|$|External {{fixation}} is {{an essential}} component of the modern orthopaedic surgeon’s armamentarium and is widely used in traumatology and reconstructive surgery.

30|$|Regarding {{complications}} such as <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infection, deep infection, compartment syndrome, mal-union and deformities, {{the results}} of the present study are comparable with other studies by Lal and Bhan, Dehao et al., Eren et al. and Tiwari et al. [19, 20].|$|R
30|$|In {{cases of}} osteomyelitic <b>pin</b> <b>tracks</b> with a {{sizeable}} cavity following debridement, these cavities {{can either be}} treated by leaving a 2 -mm antibiotic bead in the track [3] or by using antibiotic-impregnated absorbable calcium-sulphate pellets to back-fill these tracks [2].|$|R
30|$|Active {{and passive}} {{mobilization}} of the adjacent joints was started on second post-operative day. Ambulation and partial weight-bearing was {{started on the}} 2 nd or 3 rd post-operative day depending on pain, bone quality and patient compliance. Distraction at the corticotomy site was started between the 7 th and 14 th day at rate of 1  mm/day (0.25  mm every 6  h). <b>Pin</b> <b>track</b> dressings were of sterile gauze and normal saline. At the time of discharge, patients were educated to deliver <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> care, perform distraction and physiotherapy for joint mobilization and muscle strengthening. Regular follow-up every 4  weeks was done. Checks on <b>pin</b> loosening, <b>pin</b> <b>track</b> infections were carried out and radiographs obtained. The fixator was dynamised once clinical (the absence of deformity or abnormal mobility, the ability to walk and stand on the operated leg without pain) and radiological (3 or more cortices on two orthogonal views) union was declared [16]. After dynamisation, if the patient could weight bear without pain, the fixator was removed as an outpatient procedure under sedation. The operated extremity was protected with functional cast brace for 4  weeks after removal of the fixator.|$|R
