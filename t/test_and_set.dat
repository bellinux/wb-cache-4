5000|$|Dear {{radioactive}} {{ladies and}} gentlemen,As {{the bearer of}} these lines ... will explain more exactly, considering the 'false' statistics of N-14 and Li-6 nuclei, {{as well as the}} continuous &beta;-spectrum, I have hit upon a desperate remedy to save the [...] "exchange theorem" [...] of statistics and the energy theorem. Namely is the possibility that there could exist in the nuclei electrically neutral particles that I wish to call neutrons, which have spin 1/2 and obey the exclusion principle, and additionally differ from light quanta in that they do not travel with the velocity of light: The mass of the neutron must be of the same order of magnitude as the electron mass and, in any case, not larger than 0.01 proton mass. The continuous &beta;-spectrum would then become understandable by the assumption that in &beta; decay a neutron is emitted together with the electron, {{in such a way that}} the sum of the energies of neutron and electron is constant....But I don't feel secure enough to publish anything about this idea, so I first turn confidently to you, dear radioactives, with a question as to the situation concerning experimental proof of such a neutron, if it has something like about 10 times the penetrating capacity of a &gamma; ray.I admit that my remedy may appear to have a small a priori probability because neutrons, if they exist, would probably have long ago been seen. However, only those who wager can win, and the seriousness of the situation of the continuous &beta;-spectrum can be made clear by the saying of my honored predecessor in office, Mr. Debye, ... "One does best not to think about that at all, like the new taxes." ...

40|$|ISBN : 978 - 1 - 5090 - 1849 - 9 International audience—This paper {{presents}} {{a solution to}} the well-known Test-and-Set operation in asynchronous systems prone to process crashes. Test-and-Set is a synchronization operation that, when invoked by a set of processes, returns " yes " to a unique process and returns " no " to all the others. Recently many advances in implementing <b>Test</b> <b>and</b> <b>Set</b> objects have been achieved, however all of them uniquely target the shared memory model. In this paper we propose an implementation of a Test-and-Set object for message passing distributed systems. This implementation can be invoked by any number p of processes. It has an expected step complexity in O(p) and an expected message complexity in O(np), where n is the total number of processes in the system. The proposed <b>Test</b> <b>and</b> <b>Set</b> object is built atop a new basic building block that allows to select a winning group among two groups of processes...|$|E

40|$|Drawing {{ideas from}} {{previous}} authors, {{we present a}} new non-blocking concurrent queue algorithm and a new two-lock queue algorithm in which one enqueue and one dequeue can proceed concurrently. Both algorithms are simple, fast, and practical; we were surprised not to find them in the literature. Experiments on a 12 -node SGI Challenge multiprocessor indicate that the new non-blocking queue consistently outperforms the best known alternatives; it is the clear algorithm of choice for machines that provide a universal atomic primitive (e. g. compare and swap or load linked/store conditional). The two-lock concurrent queue outperforms a single lock when several processes are competing simultaneously for access; {{it appears to be}} the algorithm of choice for busy queues on machines with non-universal atomic primitives (e. g. <b>test</b> <b>and</b> <b>set).</b> Since much of the motivation for non-blocking algorithms is rooted in their immunity to large, unpredictable delays in process execution, we report experimental results both for systems with dedicated processors and for systems with several processes multiprogrammed on each processor...|$|E

40|$|Mether-NFS (MNFS) is a {{modified}} NFS which supports virtual shared memory. The model it supports {{is based on}} the Mether model[8]. It is compatible in most ways with standard NFS. The major difference is in the way mapped files are handled. Mapped files, rather than adhering to standard NFS memory consistency semantics instead obey rules such that writes are globally ordered. This allows MNFS to be used to support shared memory programs. MNFS has been used on a 16 -node SPARCStation ELC cluster to support shared memory programs. On appropriate applications we have realized supercomputer-level performance, which given the modest cost of the cluster implies a correspondingly higher price-performance. MNFS performance is superior to NFS performance in every case, but particularly in the case of write performance. Writes in MNFS are at least twice as fast as NFS. MNFS provides an extended memory operator, called Conditional Fetch-and-op (CFOP). CFOP is used to support memory synchronization. Programs using CFOP can atomically <b>test</b> <b>and</b> <b>set</b> a variable in 1. 3 milliseconds. Our target performance goal for CFOP is 500 microseconds. In order to achieve this performance we have had to highly optimize the path through the SunOS kernel on both the client and server sides...|$|E

One prior study demonstrated equivalent accuracy between urine and whole blood for one common brand of POC pregnancy testing. Our study sought to determine the difference in result times when comparing whole blood versus urine for the same brand of POC pregnancy testing. Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational study at an urban, academic, tertiary care hospital comparing the turnaround time between order and result for urine and whole blood pregnancy tests collected according to standard protocol without intervention from the investigators. After the blood was collected, the nurse would place three drops onto a Beckman Coulter ICON 25 Rapid HCG bedside pregnancy <b>test</b> <b>and</b> <b>set</b> a timer for 10 minutes.

Concordance between samples was assessed as a secondary outcome. Results: 265 total patients were included in the study.
