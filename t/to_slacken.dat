5|$|Sturdee {{attempted}} {{to widen the}} distance by turning two points to the north to prevent Spee from closing to {{within the range of}} his numerous secondary guns. Spee counteracted this maneuver by turning rapidly to the south, which forced Sturdee to turn south as well to keep within range. This allowed Scharnhorst and Gneisenau to turn back north and get close enough to engage with their secondary 15cm guns. Their shooting was so accurate that it forced the British to haul away a second time. After resuming the battle, the British gunfire became more accurate; Scharnhorst was hit several times and fires broke out. The pace of her gunfire started <b>to</b> <b>slacken,</b> though she continued to score hits on Invincible. Sturdee then turned to port in an attempt to take the leeward position, but Spee countered the turn to retain his favorable position; the maneuvering did, however, reverse the order of the ships, so Scharnhorst now engaged Inflexible.|$|E

In early 2006, the growth impulse was transmitted to investment, as corporate spending on both equipment and construction picked up markedly.

40|$|Using an "effort-regulation" type of {{efficiency}} wage model, it is demonstrated that a firm may respond <b>to</b> <b>slackening</b> labor markets by acting {{to increase the}} intensity with which workers work.

Where long-term employment relations are prevalent, the effect of labor market slack on work intensity may be diminished. These propositions are tested empirically by estimating the effects unemployment and long-term employment have on productivity growth in two-digit manufacturing industries.

The battle on both sides on {{this part of the}} Field continued to rage with unabated violence and with such indefatigable ardour did the Prussians continue the struggle, that when the fire of their skirmishers was observed <b>to</b> <b>slacken,</b> from the men having expended their ammunition, the soldiers of the 11th Hussars rushed into the midst of them, and supplied them with such cartridges as they had of their own; an act of devotion to which many of them fell a sacrifice.|$|E

Signals from the foreign sector were a little weaker, however: tourism in July remained clearly below high expectations and commodity exports lost some momentum due <b>to</b> <b>slackening</b> demand in the U. S. and transition problems of the Eastern European countries. Despite domestic strenght the rate of inflation did not exceed 3 percent until August and the current account remained in surplus.

25|$|At {{one point}} in the 19th century, Stanley became one of the world's busiest ports. However, the ship-repair trade began <b>to</b> <b>slacken</b> off in 1876 with the {{establishment}} of the Plimsoll line, which saw the elimination of the so-called coffin ships and unseaworthy vessels that might otherwise have ended up in Stanley for repair. With the introduction of increasingly reliable iron steamships in the 1890s the trade declined further and was no longer viable following the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914.

500|$|The {{garrison}} of Badajoz, ably {{commanded by}} Gen. Rafael Menacho, initially put up strong resistance and by 3 March the French had made little progress against the powerful fortress. On that day, however, Menacho {{was killed on}} the ramparts by a chance shot; command of the garrison fell to Brig. Gen. José Imaz and the Spanish defense started <b>to</b> <b>slacken.</b> [...] The walls were finally breached on 10 March. Soult was anxious to press the siege since he had learned that Masséna, in command of a disintegrating army plagued by sickness, starvation and an unusually harsh Portuguese winter, had retreated from Portugal. Concerned that the British would now be free to send a contingent to relieve Badajoz, Soult sent a deputation into the town to demand the garrison's surrender. Imaz duly capitulated and the French took possession of the fortress on 11 March.|$|E

The field batteries of the three reserve divisions were placed in camouflaged positions, close to the British front line.

40|$|The {{business}} cycle upturn {{that started in}} 2005 is continuing throughout the current year. After an increase of 3. 1 percent in 2006, real GDP is expected to expand by 3. 2 percent in 2007. While export growth is gradually decelerating, investment is gaining momentum to become the key driver of the upswing. Private household consumption, while picking up this year, still lags behind its normal cyclical profile. The strong pace of growth is leading to a marked {{increase in the number}} of jobs and a further decline in unemployment. In 2008, GDP growth is likely to decelerate to 2. 5 percent, due <b>to</b> <b>slackening</b> activity in the USA, the strength of the euro and the rise in long-term interest rates.

40|$|Cross-ties are {{employed}} as passive devices for the mitigation of stay-cable vibrations, exhibited on cable-stayed bridges under wind and wind-rain excitation. Large-amplitude oscillation {{can result in}} damage to the cables or perceived discomfort to bridge users. The “cable-cross-ties system” derived by connecting two or more stays by transverse cross-ties {{is often referred to}} as an “in-plane cable network”. Linear modeling of network dynamics has been available for some time. This framework, however, cannot be used to detect incipient failure in the restrainers due <b>to</b> <b>slackening</b> or snapping. A new model is proposed in this paper to analyze the effects of a complete loss in the pre-tensioning force imparted to the cross-ties, which leads to the “unilateral” free-vibration response of the network (i. e., a cross-tie with linear-elastic internal force in tension and partially inactive in compression). Deterministic free vibrations of a three-cable network are investigated by using the “equivalent linearization method”. A performance coefficient is introduced to monitor the relative reduction in the average (apparent) stiffness of the connector during free vibration response (“mode by mode”), exhibiting unilateral behavior. A reduction of fifty percent in the apparent stiffness was observed in the cross-tie when the pre-tensioning force is small in comparison with the tension force in the stay. This coefficient may be used as a damage indicator for the selection of the initial pre-tensioning force in the cross-ties needed <b>to</b> avoid <b>slackening.</b> </br...|$|R

2500|$|During its history, {{the society}} of the pre-modern Islamic world was {{dominated}} by two important social contexts, nomadic life and Urbanism. The historian and politician Ibn Khaldun thoroughly discusses both concepts in his book Muqaddimah. According to him, the way of life and culture of the rural bedouin nomads and the townspeople are opposed in a central social conflict. Ibn Khaldun explains {{the rise and fall of}} civilizations by his concept of Asabiyyah ("bond of cohesion", or [...] "family loyalty"), as exemplified by the rule of the caliphs. Bedouins, being the nomadic inhabitants of the steppe and the desert, are interconnected by strong bonds of asabiyyah and firm religious beliefs. These bonds tend <b>to</b> <b>slacken</b> in urban communities over some generations. In parallel, by losing their asabiyyah, the townspeople also lose the power to defend themselves, and fall victims to more aggressive tribes which may destroy the city and set up a new ruling dynasty, which over time is subject to the same weakening of power again.|$|E

That suggestion he approved. Whitley Stokes, secretary in the legislative department, was mainly responsible for the measures passed during Hobhouse's term of office, with the important exception of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, in which Hobhouse as an equity lawyer took an especial interest, and a revision of the law relating to the transfer of property, which became a statute after he left India. Of strong liberal sentiment, Hobhouse had small sympathy with the general policy of the government of India during the opening of Lord Lytton's viceroyalty. The attitude to Afghanistan was especially repugnant. He served from 1875 to 1877 as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta. On the conclusion of his term of office in 1877 he was made a K.C.S.I., and returning to England soon engaged in party politics as a thoroughgoing opponent of the Afghan policy of the conservative government.|$|E
