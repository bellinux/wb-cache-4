5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E
5|$|What Arafat {{says about}} me doesn't bother me. Not only he, {{but also a}} whole list of Arab and world {{politicians}} claim that I am an agent of the Zionists or the CIA. Others state that I am a mercenary of the French secret service and of the Soviet KGB. The latest rumor is that I am an agent of Khomeini. During a certain period <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> were spies for the Iraqi regime. Now they say that we are Syrian agents.... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.|$|E
25|$|<b>They</b> <b>said,</b> <b>we</b> {{corrupted}} each other, {{and that}} they thought when we were parted, we would have bowed to them. But they found we were more stronger afterwards than we were before; the Lord our God did fit us for every condition.|$|E

500|$|Kahne {{appeared}} in victory lane {{in front of}} the crowd of 170,000 to celebrate his sixth win of the season earning him $305,889. Kahne was delighted with his victory and thanked the people who worked on his car's transmission and rear-end: [...] "We had a great car. It was unbelievable all night. I slammed it into second gear at the end of pit road one time and I thought I had to break something. This isn't the special car. This car's been good two other times this year, but it went to waste. It's just an awesome team." [...] Second-place finisher Johnson said he finished the event where he ran in its duration: “I only made up ten points. But ten points is ten points.” Third-place finisher Burton was happy to recover from a tire issue from the previous race at Talladega Superspeedway. However, he was upset that he stalled his engine as he felt it cost him the chance of victory. Burton also said his late-race vibration was enough to scare him and was glad the race ended because of the amount of shudder coming from his car: [...] "I screamed, ‘We’ve got a wheel loose, we got a wheel loose’ and <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> <b>we</b> do not have a wheel loose, we know we got them tight." ...|$|E
500|$|In the EuroBasket 2005, Nowitzki {{came back}} strong. He {{surprisingly}} led a depleted German squad into the Finals, beating title favorites Slovenia in the quarter-finals and Spain in the semi-finals on the way. EuroBasket pundits praised Nowitzki in both matches: against Slovenia (76–62), the forward scored a game high 22 points and commented: [...] "The Slovenians underestimated us. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> were the team they wanted {{and that was}} wrong, you shouldn't {{do that in the}} quarter-finals." [...] Against Spain (74–73), Nowitzki scored a game-high 27 points and scored the decisive basket: down by one and with only a few seconds to go, he drove on Spanish forward Jorge Garbajosa, and hit a baseline jump shot over Garbajosa's outstretched arms with 3.9 seconds to go. The German later commented: [...] "It was indescribable. Garbajosa kind of pushed me towards the baseline so I just went with it." [...] Despite losing the Finals, 78–62, to the Greeks, Nowitzki was the tournament's leading scorer (26.7 per game) and second-leading rebounder (10.8 per game) and shot blocker (1.8 per game), and was voted Most Valuable Player of the tournament. When he was subbed out {{towards the end of the}} final, Nowitzki received standing ovation from the crowd, which he later recalled as [...] "one of the best moments of [...] career". In the 2006 FIBA World Championship, Nowitzki led the German team to an eighth place and commented: [...] "It's tough luck. But overall, finishing eighth in the world is not bad." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Myrtle Beach Convention Center {{had ceased}} {{attempting}} {{to find a}} replacement for the Carolina Harley-Davidson Dealers Association, which had moved to Hard Rock Park. The reason for moving The Carolina Harley-Davidson Dealers Association event to New Bern in 2009 was that Myrtle Beach, [...] "passed all these silly laws, <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> ruined their May, so {{we talked about it}} and decided to oblige them," [...] said Gene Lummus, former president of the association.|$|E

2500|$|From {{the start}} of the series, the lack of a {{relationship}} with her father serves as motivation for Erica's actions. She {{is an example of the}} Nixon staple of the [...] "lost daddy's girl." [...] Eric abandons her and her mother before {{the start of}} the show, when Erica is nine years old. As a result, she develops a severe abandonment complex. Since Eric leaves his family for a successful career in Hollywood, Erica also longs for a life of fame and a successful man. This motivation is maintained in the character decades into the series. [...] "Susan added a lot of Erica's background," [...] Behr said. [...] "Rather than playing it as if Erica's just a rotten character, she added the pathos of this child who was deserted by her father. Every time she did a scene about how 'My father loves me. I know that he loves me and nobody is going to tell me differently,' she colored it with the knowledge that she had really been deserted. It worked so well that the writers reached the point where <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> have to play this out." [...] In 1989, the Eric Kane character makes his first appearance as Erica goes in search of him and finds him working as a clown at a circus. She attempts to help him out of his current circumstances, but he ends up betraying her and leaving Pine Valley.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, {{and when}} we came up, they jeered us," [...] said Phil. [...] "Oh, but wasn't I mad! <b>They</b> <b>said</b> if <b>we</b> tried to force our way in, they'd ring up the doctor, or Mr. Dale." ...|$|R
2500|$|Soviet {{dissident}} Natan Sharansky described that [...] "in 1984 KGB officials, {{on coming}} to me in prison" [...] when Amalrik's essay was mentioned, [...] "laughed at this prediction. 'Amalrik is long dead', <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> 'but <b>we</b> are still very much present.'" ...|$|R
2500|$|Soviet {{authorities}} were skeptical. Natan Sharansky explained that [...] "in 1984 KGB officials, on {{coming to me}} in prison" [...] when Amalrik's prediction was mentioned, [...] "laughed at this prediction. Amalrik is long dead, <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> but <b>we</b> are still very much present." ...|$|R

60|$|The funny part {{used to be}} {{that people}} always pitied us when the time came for us to return. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> must be so lonesome over there, with no other {{children}} near us, and not even a woman to look after us.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am happy}} {{we have all}} met, and that you now {{understand}} us a little. When {{you go back to}} England, you will defend us when we are defamed? You will not let them persecute us, as they did a few years back, because <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> crucified their children at the feast of our passover?' ...|$|E
60|$|The train left at this juncture. We entreated {{the railway}} {{officials}} {{to let us}} stop and see the show out. The play was becoming quite interesting. It {{was so full of}} movement. But <b>they</b> <b>said</b> that <b>we</b> were half-an-hour late as it was, and that they dared not.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was only}}," [...] {{continued}} Honora, in desperation, [...] "it {{was only to}} leave Mr. Grainger and Mrs. Kame there to spend the night. <b>They</b> all <b>said</b> <b>we</b> {{had plenty of time}} to go and get back to Quicksands by six o'clock. But coming back the automobile broke down--" ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{they reached}} their homes {{they took it}} to the council-lodge, and hung it up before the fire, {{fastening}} it with raw hide soaked, which would shrink and become tightened by the action of the fire. 'We will then see,' <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> 'if <b>we</b> cannot make it shut its eyes.' ...|$|R
60|$|These men, too, had {{all along}} {{had a great}} mind to a voyage for the {{mainland}} of Africa, where <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> should have a fair cast for our lives, and might be sure to make ourselves rich, which way soever we went, if we were but able to make our way through, whether by sea or by land.|$|E
60|$|When we {{realized}} that Father and Mother meant what <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> were just too miserable to live. When I went to bed that night I simply pulled the clothes over my face and howled quietly. I couldn't help it when I thought of Pamelia's white silk dress and tulle veil and flower girls and all the rest. Johnny {{said it was the}} wedding dinner he thought about. Boys are like that, you know.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will now}} proceed," [...] said he. But {{at that moment}} his {{attention}} was attracted by the three mariners, who had clambered over the pointed pales of the fence and who now appeared on the piazza, Bill to the right hand of Mr. Enderton, Jim to the left, and the red-bearded coxswain at his back. They all seemed to speak at once, though what <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> could not hear, nothing but a few hoarse mutterings coming down to us.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{are getting}} tired of this moor,' <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> 'and to-morrow <b>we</b> think of trying another, where the lakes are larger and the feeding better. Will you come with us?' ...|$|R
60|$|We {{had arrived}} at nine; the {{ceremony}} was not to begin, <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> till two: <b>we</b> had five hours before us to see all that from our places could be seen.|$|R
2500|$|Kim later {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} how he felt during the 2001 World Series. [...] "We went through the whole season, 25 guys and then the coaching staff. That time it was like old people. <b>They</b> <b>said,</b> 'OK, <b>we</b> got last chance.'Some people <b>said</b> if <b>we</b> don't win, next year everybody's gone." [...] Kim continued, [...] "Then I gave up a home run. I didn't feel good. But we won." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An old gentleman the {{day before}} was talking to Mr. Acton. I think he is some great swell, for he has got a yacht, and servants, and a carriage, and lots of things; and he said, 'What! are those poor Brownlow's boys? bless me!' and he tipped us each. Allen and Bobus were to go with Mr. Acton and have a sail in his yacht, but <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> should be too many, so we thought we'd get a new boat, but the Captain—-" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 1. Thy own vows and {{promises}} shall {{be a witness}} against thee, that thou hast, contrary to thy light and knowledge, destroyed thy soul, as Joshua said {{to the children of}} Israel, when they said the Lord should be their God. Well, saith he, [...] "Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the Lord, to serve him." [...] That is, if now you turn back again, even this covenant and resolution of yours will in the great day be a witness against you--"And <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> <b>We</b> are witnesses" [...] (Josh 24:22).|$|E
6000|$|... "Time went on. There was no swordsman, or pistol-shot like me in London, <b>they</b> <b>said.</b> <b>We</b> {{had as many}} pupils as we liked--it was {{the only}} part of my life when I have been able to save money. I had no chance to spend it. We gave lessons all day, and in the evening were too tired to go out. That year I had the misfortune to lose my dear mother. I became a rich man--yes, sir, at that time I must have had not less than six hundred a year.|$|E
2500|$|Beppe Grillo, {{the leader}} of the Five Star Movement, stated [...] "The {{mainstream}} media has often spoken of [...] in the same way they speak of our movement. Do you remember? <b>They</b> <b>said</b> that <b>we</b> were sexist, homophobic, demagogues, populists. They do not realize that millions of people no longer read their newspapers or watch their TVs. Trump capitalized on all this." ...|$|R
60|$|Now {{the baby}} when it arrived really {{proved to be}} a girl, but as the aunt could not bear the boys, she {{thought it was a good}} {{opportunity}} to get rid of them.
