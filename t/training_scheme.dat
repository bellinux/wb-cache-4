5|$|The Southern Rhodesian {{economy grew}} {{considerably}} {{during the war}} despite the concurrent rise of war expenditure {{to pay for the}} expansion of the military and the air <b>training</b> <b>scheme.</b> Expenditure on the war grew from £1,793,367 in the financial year 1940–41 to £5,334,701 in 1943–44—total Southern Rhodesian expenditure on the air <b>training</b> <b>scheme</b> was £11,215,522. These sums, while tiny compared to those incurred by larger nations, were enormous when scaled against the white population of less than 70,000 that accounted for most of the colony's economic output. Annual costs for the air <b>training</b> <b>scheme</b> alone far exceeded the pre-war national budget.|$|E

40|$|Channel {{estimation}} {{is one of}} the {{key components}} of space-time systems design. The transmission of pilot symbols, referred to as training, is often used to aid channel acquisition. In this paper, a class of generalized <b>training</b> <b>schemes</b> that allow the superposition of training and data symbols is considered. First, the Cramr [...] Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived as a function of the power allocation matrices that characterize different <b>training</b> <b>schemes.</b> Then, equivalent <b>training</b> <b>schemes</b> are obtained, and the behavior of the CRLB is analyzed under different power constraints. It is shown that for certain <b>training</b> <b>schemes,</b> superimposing data with training symbols increases CRLB, and concentrating training power reduces CRLB. On the other hand, once the channel is acquired, uniformly superimposed power allocation maximizes the mutual information and, hence, the capacity...|$|R

5|$|Promoted to brigadier in 1928, Burgess became Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces, a {{position}} {{now known as}} the Chief of Army, in 1931 for a four-year term. The country's economic difficulties made his appointment a difficult one. The depression had resulted in New Zealand's compulsory military <b>training</b> <b>scheme</b> being abolished and the Territorial Force needed to be reorganised accordingly.|$|E
5|$|With a peacetime {{establishment}} of about 16,000 personnel (18,400 upon mobilisation), the division {{was brought up}} to strength through the compulsory <b>training</b> <b>scheme.</b> Initially the system worked well {{and a number of}} the division's subunits reported being above establishment, however, this did not last long. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed and theoretically alleviated Australia's security concerns about Japanese expansion in the Pacific. As a result, the Army's budget was halved and as the scope of the compulsory <b>training</b> <b>scheme</b> was scaled back, the authorised strength of each infantry battalion was reduced to just 409 men of all ranks. The division's artillery was also reduced, with one field battery in each artillery brigade being disbanded at this time. As a result of the subsequent reorganisation, the 3rd Division's artillery consisted of three artillery brigades, the 2nd, 4th and 8th.|$|E

5|$|Blamey was {{involved}} in discussions with the government over {{the size of the}} Army to be maintained. Now that the danger of invasion of Australia had passed, the government reconsidered how the nation's resources, particularly of manpower, should be distributed. Blamey pressed for a commitment to maintain three AIF divisions, as only they could legally be sent north of the equator where the final campaigns would be fought. He urged that the Empire Air <b>Training</b> <b>Scheme</b> be curtailed, and opposed MacArthur's proposal to use the Australian Army primarily for logistic support and leave combat roles principally to American troops.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{preparations}} were {{underway in}} Rhodesia to expand facilities {{for the training}} of pilots. In January 1940 the government announced {{the creation of a}} Department of Air, completely separate from that of Defence. Guest was appointed Minister of Air, a post he held from 28 March 1940 to 6 May 1946. He inaugurated and administered what became the second largest Empire Air <b>Training</b> <b>Scheme,</b> beginning with the establishment of three units at Salisbury, Bulawayo and Gwelo, each comprising a preliminary and an advanced training school.|$|E

He hoped to be stationed in Britain, but was posted to the Middle East instead; there he joined No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF, flying Hurricanes. In October 1943, in Egypt, Smith crashed his Hurricane after his throttle malfunctioned during a dawn takeoff. Suffering serious facial disfigurements, he also broke his jaw, leg and shoulder. Doctors and surgeons in Cairo rebuilt Smith's face through skin grafts and plastic surgery, and he was passed fit to fly again in March 1944. Turning down an offer to return to Rhodesia as an instructor, he rejoined No. 237 Squadron, which had switched to flying Spitfire Mk IXs, in Corsica in May 1944.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} military, Phillipps became a grazier in New South Wales.

Raised to flight lieutenant, he was posted as assistant chief ground instructor to No.2 Elementary Flying Training School (No.2 EFTS) at Archerfield, Queensland, on 27March. No.2 EFTS was one of twelve basic flying schools established by the RAAF as part of Australia's contribution to the Empire Air <b>Training</b> <b>Scheme.</b> Phillipps was appointed chief ground instructor on 17June. Having been promoted to squadron leader, he assumed command of No.2 EFTS on 20October 1940.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Thornton {{performed}} occupation duties with Jayforce, in Japan, {{where he}} was the Senior British Liaison Officer in the Tokyo sub-area. He returned to New Zealand in July 1946 to serve as a staff officer at Army Headquarters. In 1948 he commenced a two-year term as Deputy Chief of Staff and during this time he worked towards the implementation of a compulsory military <b>training</b> <b>scheme</b> for the Territorial Force, which commenced in May 1950. He was dispatched to England in 1952 to attend the Imperial Defence College after which he led the New Zealand Joint Services Liaison Staff in London. During this time, in which New Zealand's military affairs were dominated by the country's involvement in the Korean War, Thornton began to demonstrate the diplomatic skills that would prove useful during his later career.|$|E

40|$|Active Labour Market Policies (ALMPs), {{which provide}} {{training}} and subsidised employment to the unemployed, {{are an important}} part of Ireland’s welfare state. While a good deal of existing research is concerned with the effect of these policies on employment chances and on wage rates, none addresses the connection between poverty and ALMPs. Do these policies have an effect on poverty? That is, first, to what extent do these policies serve the low-income population, as a consequence of and in addition to their focus on those in precarious labour market situations? Second, to what extent do these policies function to lift people out of poverty in the medium term? To address these issues we use longitudinal data from the Living in Ireland Survey (1994 – 2001) and examine how the respondents’ situation in one year predicts participation in employment and <b>training</b> <b>schemes</b> in the next year, and then how participation in these schemes affects poverty status in the following year. Participants on both sorts of schemes are much poorer than the population average, and those on employment <b>schemes</b> (but not <b>training</b> <b>schemes)</b> are even poorer than one would expect given their observed characteristics. Employment <b>schemes</b> and <b>training</b> <b>schemes</b> serve different purposes and different populations. A conventional logistic regression analysis seems to suggest that employment <b>schemes</b> (but not <b>training</b> <b>schemes)</b> positively increase the risk of poverty in the following year. This finding is not considered reliable, but rather it reflects the selection processes whereby those on employment schemes are in particularly vulnerable situations, in respects that are not picked up in the data set. A more rigorous analysis, using propensity score matching, reveals that employment schemes are neutral on poverty risk. <b>Training</b> <b>schemes</b> have a weak but insignificant protective effect. Considering the risk of poverty approximately one year after participation begins, employment schemes (and to a lesser extent, <b>training</b> <b>schemes)</b> do not provide a mechanism for immediately exiting poverty. We add the caveat that it may be desirable to consider outcomes two or more years into the future, were data available, and that other outcome measures of quality of life should also be taken into account. Ultimately, with regard to both labour market and poverty outcomes, we find no evidence that participants of <b>training</b> <b>schemes</b> or employment schemes have either raised their employment chances or reduced their risk of poverty in the year following their participation. ...|$|R
40|$|This study evaluates {{and compares}} the {{effectiveness}} of two alternative <b>training</b> <b>schemes</b> for the unemployed: short, job-search oriented training and long, human capital oriented training. We investigate {{the effects of these}} programs on unemployment and employment duration. Our analysis uses a rich administrative longitudinal data set for Germany where both programs were implemented at the same time. Our estimation strategy flexibly accounts for dynamic selection on observables and unobservables as well as heterogeneous treatment effects. The results indicate that short-term <b>training</b> <b>schemes</b> tend to be an effective tool to reduce unemployment in the long run, in particular if participation occurs early during unemployment. Longterm <b>training</b> <b>schemes</b> tend to increase the average duration of employment spells more strongly than short-term training. However, they increase the expected unemployment duration if they are started early during unemployment. This negative short-run impact of long-term training is an important driver of its overall effectiveness...|$|R
