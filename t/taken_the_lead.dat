5|$|Australia {{headed into}} the First Test at Trent Bridge with ten wins and two draws from twelve tour matches, {{including}} eight innings victories. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. Pundits predicted that the pitch would be ideal for batting after offering some assistance to fast bowlers in the first hour. The surface had greened up following overnight rain. Australia's fast bowlers reduced England to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165 late on the first day. The tourists had already <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> by the time Hassett came in to join Bradman at 4/185 on the second afternoon. The hard-hitting Miller had come in at No. 4, the more Hassett's usual position, indicating that Bradman may have been looking to attack, but the change in batting order failed as Miller was out for a duck.|$|E

The race {{was the subject of}} considerable advance publicity, and was portrayed as a clash between the two most powerful forces in European racing; Godolphin, represented by Fantastic Light, and Ballydoyle/Coolmore represented by Galileo. As in the Prince of Wales's Stakes, Dettori settled Fantastic Light in the early stages before moving him out to challenge in the straight. Galileo had already <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> but Fantastic Light moved up and went level a furlong out.

5|$|United played {{cup holders}} Arsenal in the semi-final at Villa Park on 11 April. Neither team {{was able to}} score even after extra time had been played, {{therefore}} the match was decided in a replay four days later. Beckham opened the scoring for United with a long range effort, but Dennis Bergkamp drew Arsenal level with a shot that deflected off United's centre back Jaap Stam. Arsenal then thought they had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> when Nicolas Anelka put {{the ball in the}} back of United's net, but the goal was ruled out for offside. United's captain Roy Keane was red-carded for two bookable offences and United played the last thirty minutes of normal time with ten men. In injury time {{at the end of the}} second half, Phil Neville fouled Ray Parlour in the penalty area. Peter Schmeichel parried away Bergkamp's resultant spot kick and the game went into extra time.|$|E

In Malaysia, Webber started 4th {{on the grid}} and was still running in that position before a hydraulics failure ended his race on lap 14. In his home race, Webber qualified seventh and was leading the race before his gearbox failed on lap 22. Webber had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> of the race on lap 21, becoming the first Australian to lead the Australian Grand Prix since John Bowe had done so in the early laps of the non-championship 1984 Australian Grand Prix. A sixth-place finish in San Marino saw Webber move up to 9th in the Championship. In the , hydraulics failure struck again ending his race after he had fought {{his way back to}} 12th from his 19th place start on the grid due to a mid-weekend engine change.|$|E
5|$|Argyle {{salvaged}} a late point against Preston North End at {{the start}} of March, but remained in serious trouble at the bottom end of the table, seven points adrift of safety with 13 matches remaining. A 2–0 defeat followed at Queens Park Rangers, with Adel Taarabt playing a part in both of the home sides goals. Draws at Home Park were proving to be an Achilles' heel for Argyle, but they secured a creditable 1–1 draw at play-off chasing Coventry City, having <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> through a glancing header from Árnason. Three days later, a 20-yard strike from captain Fletcher earned Argyle their fifth home win of the season in a 3–2 thriller against Bristol City. They had taken a 2–0 lead through Chris Clark and an overhead kick from Bradley Wright-Phillips, his first for the club. However, the visitors responded in the second-half with two goals from Nicky Maynard before former Welsh international Fletcher scored with seconds to spare. Argyle travelled to play Scunthorpe United looking to keep up the momentum, but threw away a lead to be defeated by a deflected effort from Martyn Woolford.|$|E
5|$|Bradford {{started their}} league season on 11 August 2007 with a 1–1 draw with Macclesfield Town, when {{a crowd of}} 14,345 was inside Valley Parade, 1,000 more than was {{originally}} announced. The attendance was more than 6,000 higher than any other game in the division. Macclesfield had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead,</b> with City equalising shortly before half-time when Guylain Ndumbu-Nsungu scored with a rebound after Barry Conlon's penalty was saved. Four days later City were at Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers, for {{the first round of}} the League Cup. Wolves scored twice in the first five minutes of the second half, and despite Kyle Nix pulling one back for Bradford, City went out 2–1. City's second league game of the season was the first league game to be played at Shrewsbury Town's new £15m ground the New Meadow, when an early penalty from former City player Dave Hibbert gave the home side a 1–0 win.

Going underneath Hamlin in turn 2, Dale Earnhardt Jr. <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on lap 108. J. J. Yeley was blacked flagged for his window net being down. Compounding this, he was tagged for speeding on pit road and forced to serve a drive-through penalty. Jeff Gordon went outside of Earnhardt in <b>the</b> tri-oval and <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on lap 111. Debris in turn 3 brought out the fifth caution of the race on lap 115. Kevin Harvick was tagged for his crew being over the wall too soon and restarted from the tail-end of the field.|$|R
5|$|Chelsea {{lined up}} in a 4-3-3 {{formation}} while Liverpool, who kicked off the match, {{lined up in}} a 4-4-2. Within nine minutes Liverpool had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead.</b> Defender John Arne Riise ran with the ball from his own half and hit a shot from , which beat Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini. Chelsea midfielder Ballack received the first booking of the match in the 7th minute after he kicked Liverpool midfielder Momo Sissoko, and his partner Frank Lampard was given a yellow card eight minutes later for kicking Boudewijn Zenden. Liverpool almost extended their lead in the 22nd minute, when Paulo Ferreira's pass to Cudicini caught him unaware, however the ball went wide of the Chelsea goal and out for a corner. Chelsea made the first substitution of the match in the 26th minute when debutant Salomon Kalou replaced the injured Ballack. Cudicini kept the score at 1–0 in the 42nd minute, when he made saves to deny González and then a subsequent Peter Crouch shot. Chelsea scored two minutes later when Lampard passed the ball cross-field to striker Shevchenko who controlled the ball {{on his chest and}} shot past Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina to level the score at 1–1.|$|E
5|$|Coulson scored after 15 {{seconds to}} give York the lead {{at home to}} league leaders Oxford United, and with further goals from Chambers and Patrick McLaughlin the team {{went on to win}} 3–1. York won 1–0 away in their first round match of the Football League Trophy against Rotherham United, with Blair scoring an 80th-minute winner. Walker's {{equaliser}} in the fifth minute of stoppage time secured a 2–2 draw at home to Chesterfield.

5|$|Internazionale had {{the first}} attack of the match. With Renato Cappellini running down the wing and {{supplying}} a cross to Sandro Mazzola whose header hit Celtic goalkeeper Ronnie Simpson's knees. Internazionale won a penalty moments later. Jim Craig fouled Cappellini in the box, and Mazzola converted to put Inter in front after only six minutes. Once they had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead,</b> Internazionale retreated back into their defensive style, which allowed Celtic to attack. However, they struggled to get through Internazionale's defensive wall and were mainly restricted to long shots from outside the box. Bertie Auld hit the crossbar then a cross from Jimmy Johnstone was gathered up by Giuliano Sarti, who then tipped a header from the same player over the crossbar. Internazionale pulled nine men back, but Celtic kept attacking them. Tommy Gemmell's dangerous free-kick was saved by Sarti, he then speculatively attempted to lob the Inter 'keeper and hit the bar. Despite Celtic's inability to break through their opponents defence they were in complete control of the match and Internazionale {{were not able to}} attack. Inter had not had another chance since their goal, whilst Celtic found themselves foiled time and again by outstanding goalkeeping from Sarti.|$|E
