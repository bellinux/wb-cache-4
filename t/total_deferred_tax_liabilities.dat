40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of deferred tax assets and liabilities for a sample of large U. S. corporations between 1993 and 2004 and documents substantial heterogeneity in the deferred tax positions of different firms. In 2004, 25 firms {{in a sample of}} 73 reported net deferred tax assets and 48 reported net deferred tax liabilities. Firms differ substantially in the composition of their deferred tax assets and liabilities. The largest components of deferred tax assets for sample firms are Loss and Credit Carryforwards and Employment and Post-employment Benefits. The largest components of deferred tax liabilities are Property, Plant & Equipment and Leases. Total deferred tax assets for sample firms with net deferred tax assets in 2004 were $ 61. 9 billion, while <b>total</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> for sample firms with net deferred tax liabilities were $ 223. 8 billion. A five percentage point decline in the federal statutory corporate tax rate could reduce net income at sample firms with net deferred tax assets by as much as $ 8. 8 billion, since a statutory rate cut would reduce the value of deferred tax assets and this change would be reflected on the income statement. We use data on the sales, market value, and assets of sample firms, relative to aggregate data for the U. S. corporate sector, to estimate the aggregate value of deferred tax assets and liabilities...|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} value relevance analysis of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> on companies that revalued its fixed assets {{for the period}} of 2008 - 2015. Selection of these companies is because fixed assets revaluation is one of the components of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes.</b> Fixed Assets Revaluation will cause <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> asset or <b>liability</b> depend on the comparison of the company recorded value and the market value. When the company recorded value is larger than the market value of assets would cause <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liability,</b> and in contrast if the company recorded value is lower than the market value of assets would cause <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> asset. 120 firms are the total sample of this study.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the theory underlying the current accounting and reporting standards for <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> and concludes that using the flow-through accounting approach is a better fit for reporting this financial statement item than the asset-liability approach currently required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).

To obtain a perspective on the magnitude and behavior of the <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> account balances reported by firms, 2, 100 firms in 20 industries were observed approximately over a ten-year period (1997 - 2006). Most firms appear to postpone <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> reversals by utilizing tax planning strategies, allowing them to defer indefinitely the requirement to pay tax on earlier timing differences. Therefore, net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> balances {{can be thought of}} as possible or remote contingencies rather than probable liabilities. To illustrate the financial consequences of using the approach where the tax expense is equal to the statutory <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> instead of the expense reported under the current rules, the change in the debt-to-equity (DTE) ratios was computed for the firms in the sample by eliminating the net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> balances from <b>liabilities</b> and adding them to equities...|$|R

30|$|In this context, ETR {{represents}} {{the relationship between}} overall <b>tax</b> expense, including <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes,</b> and pre-tax earnings of the year. Thus, by taking into account provisions for <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> that were simultaneously set aside, this rate disregards any effects that shift current tax expenses or tax payables to later accounting periods. In contrast to this, CurrETR depicts only the current <b>tax</b> expenses excluding <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes,</b> and CashETR indicates the relative size of cash taxes paid (Hanlon and Heitzman 2010). As in most cases of international double taxation the German tax system imposes the exemption method by following the worldwide approach to taxing foreign income, Germany-based multinationals can easily use the benefits of lower foreign tax rates (Spengel 2005). Consequently, profit shifting should not lead to excessively high <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> which could potentially bias tax rate measures.|$|R
