Approximately 8 acre of soil was contaminated by wood with arsenic, chromium, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. 8% of Portland cement was used by wet weight of contaminated soil.

The responses of three agriculturally important bacteria viz., Bradyrhizobium, Sulphate re-ducing and Iron oxidizing bacteria, were studied. Total viable counts were also made. Three dif-ferent types of biomasses viz., rice husk, rice straw and saw dust, and biochars produced thereof were used for the study. The biomasses or biochars were applied to the soil at a rate of 5 t/ha. The study included seven different treatments of biomasses and corresponding biochars including a control.

50|$|The maximum soil {{temperature}} {{that can be}} obtained in a rotary dryer depends on {{the composition of the}} dryer shell. The soil discharge temperature of carbon steel drums is typically 300 to 600 degrees F. Alloy drums are available that can increase the soil discharge temperature to 1,200 degrees F. Most rotary dryers that are used to treat petroleum contaminated soil are made of carbon steel.

50|$|Condensers and {{activated}} carbon {{may also be}} used to treat the offgas from thermal screw systems. Condensers may be either water-cooled or electrically cooled systems to decrease offgas temperatures to 100 °F to 140 °F. The efficiency of condensers for removing organic compounds ranges from 50% to greater than 95%. Noncondensible gases exiting the condenser are normally treated by a vapor-phase {{activated carbon}} treatment system. The efficiency of activated carbon adsorption systems for removing organic contaminants ranges from 50% to 99%. Condensate from the condenser is processed through a phase separator where the non-aqueous phase organic component is separated and disposed of or recycled.

5000|$|Microbial induced calcium {{carbonate}} precipitation {{has been proposed}} as an alternative cementation technique to improve the properties of potentially liquefiable sand.

To evaluate the effect of lemon waste on soil pH and availability of micronutrients, composite soil samples were collected from 0 - 40 Cm of the area and analyzed for physico- chemical properties. Lemon waste was gathered from processing factory, dried at 70 c and crushed to 1 - 2 mm size. A statistical complete randomized design with 4 replicate and 30 treatments were used for evaluation of lemon waste on soil properties. The treatments were 0, 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1600 PPM of lemon waste which were added to pots containing 160 go soils and leaved in incubator for 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks at 27 - 30 c, pot moisture were kept at field capacity during the experiment.

50|$|Most {{of the gas}} {{generated}} during heating of the heat-transfer oil {{does not}} come into contact the waste material and can be discharged directly to the atmosphere without emission controls. The remainder of the flue gas maintains the thermal screw purge gas exit temperature above 300 degrees F. This ensures that volatilized organics and moisture do not condense. In addition, the recycled flue gas has a low oxygen content (less than 2% by volume) which minimizes oxidation of the organics and reduces the explosion hazard. If pretreatment analytical data indicates a high organic content (greater than 4 percent), use of a thermal screw is recommended. After the <b>treated</b> <b>soil</b> exits the thermal screw, water is sprayed on the soil for cooling and dust control. Thermal screws are available with soil treatment capacities ranging from 3-15 tons per hour.|$|E
50|$|A {{conveyor}} furnace uses a flexible metal belt to convey soil through the primary heating chamber. A one-inch-deep layer of soil is spread {{evenly over the}} belt. As the belt moves through the system, soil agitators lift the belt and turn the soil to enhance heat transfer and volatilization of organics. The {{conveyor furnace}} can heat soils to temperatures from 300 to 800 degrees F. At the higher temperature range, the conveyor furnace is more effective in treating some heavier petroleum hydrocarbons than are oil- or steam-heated thermal screws, asphalt plant aggregate dryers, and carbon steel rotary dryers. After the <b>treated</b> <b>soil</b> exits the conveyor furnace, it is sprayed with water for cooling and dust control. As of February 1993, only one conveyor furnace system was currently in use for the remediation of petroleum contaminated soil. This system is mobile and can treat 5 to 10 tons of soil per hour.|$|E

P. hermaphrodita is the only nematode of the eight families associated with molluscs, which has been developed as a biological molluscicide, first released under the name Nemaslug® by MicroBio Ltd in 1994, then acquired by Becker Underwood in 2000 and finally taken over by BASF in 2012. Nemaslug® is sold in 15 European countries and is widely used by farmers and gardeners. It can only kill slugs and snails and does not harm non-target organisms like earthworms, insects & acarids. Other methods of slug control include chemical molluscicides such as metaldehyde, iron phosphate and carbamate compounds (Methiocarb and Thiodicarb) {{have been shown to}} cause damage to many beneficial/non-beneficial non-target organisms including mammals.P. hermaphrodita is currently mass produced in fermenters (up to 20,000 litres) in a monoxenic liquid broth of the bacterium Moraxella osloensis.

The stress-strain of stabilized soils under different loading conditions is essential to properly understand how the material will behave when exposed to applied load.
