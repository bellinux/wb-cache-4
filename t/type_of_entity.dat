2500|$|In his 1963 paper Realism he popularised a {{controversial}} approach {{to understanding the}} historical dispute between realist and other non-realist schools of philosophy such as idealism, nominalism, Irrealism etc. [...] He characterized all of these latter positions as anti-realist and argued that the fundamental disagreement between realist and anti-realist was over the nature of truth. [...] For Dummett, realism is best understood as accepting the classical characterisation of truth as bivalent (every proposition is either true or false) and evidence-transcendent, while anti-realism rejects this {{in favor of a}} concept of knowable (or assertible) truth. [...] Historically, these debates had been understood as disagreements about whether a certain <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>entity</b> objectively exists or not. Thus, we may speak of (anti-)realism with respect to other minds, the past, the future, universals, mathematical entities (such as natural numbers), moral categories, the material world, or even thought. [...] The novelty of Dummett's approach consisted in seeing these disputes as, at base, analogous to the dispute between intuitionism and Platonism in the philosophy of mathematics.|$|E

30|$|The {{original}} {{figure is}} from Latapy (Latapy et al. 2008), {{this one is}} redrawn by the author.Due to the existence <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> relations in the data set, social network analysts have defined the mode of a network. The mode {{is measured by the}} number <b>of</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>entities.</b> The networks we usually consider are either a one-mode network or a two-mode network. If nodes in the network all belong to the same type, {{as in the case of}} friend networks, and every pair of relations is thought to exist between the same <b>types</b> <b>of</b> individuals, the network is considered to be a one-mode network. If the network contains two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>entities</b> such as individuals and organizations (say, professors and universities), the network is a two-mode network. In short, the key is to identify how many <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>entities</b> are taken into account: teachers and students, teachers and classes, and volunteers and volunteer organizations can all be thought of as networks consisting <b>of</b> two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>entities</b> (Borgatti & Everett 1997).|$|R

2500|$|In December 1953, Nehru {{appointed}} the States Reorganisation Commission {{to prepare for}} the creation of states on linguistic lines. This was headed by Justice Fazal Ali and the commission itself was also known as the Fazal Ali Commission. The efforts of this commission were overseen by Govind Ballabh Pant, who served as Nehru's Home Minister from December 1954. The commission created a report in 1955 recommending the reorganisation of India's states. Under the Seventh Amendment, the existing distinction between Part A, Part B, Part C, and Part D states was abolished. The distinction between Part A and Part B states was removed, becoming known simply as [...] "states". A new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>entity,</b> the union territory, replaced the classification as a Part C or Part D state. Nehru stressed commonality among Indians and promoted pan-Indianism. He refused to reorganise states on either religious or ethnic lines. Western scholars have mostly praised Nehru for the integration of the states into a modern republic but the act was not accepted universally in India.|$|E

40|$|Heterogeneous {{entities}} or {{objects are}} very common {{and are usually}} interrelated {{with each other in}} many scenarios. For example, typical Web search activities involve multiple <b>types</b> <b>of</b> interrelated <b>entities</b> such as end users, Web pages, and search queries. In this paper, we define and study a novel problem: Search Heterogeneous INterrelated Entities (SHINE). Given a SHINE-query which can be any <b>type(s)</b> <b>of</b> <b>entities,</b> the task <b>of</b> SHINE is to retrieve multiple <b>types</b> <b>of</b> related <b>entities</b> to answer this query. This is in contrast to the traditional search, which only deals with a single <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>entities</b> (e. g., Web pages). The advantages of SHINE include: (1) It is feasible for end users to specify their information need along different dimensions by accepting queries with different types. (2) Answering a query by multiple <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>entities</b> provides informative context for users to better understand the search results and facilitate their information exploration. (3) Multiple relations among heterogeneous entities can be utilized to improve the ranking <b>of</b> any particular <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>entities.</b> To attain the goal of SHINE, we propose to represent all entities in a unified space through utilizing their interaction relationships. Two approaches, M-LSA and E-VSM, are discussed and compared in this paper. The experiments on 3 data sets (i. e., a literature data set, a search engine log data set, and a recommendation data set) show the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed methods...|$|R

40|$|Many popular {{web service}} {{networks}} are content- rich in terms <b>of</b> heterogeneous <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>entities</b> and links, associated with incomplete attributes. Clustering such hetero- geneous service networks demands new clustering techniques {{that can handle}} two heterogeneity challenges: (1) multiple <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>entities</b> co-exist in the same service network with multiple attributes, and (2) links between entities have diverse types and carry different semantics. Existing heterogeneous graph clustering techniques tend to pick initial centroids uniformly at random, specify the number k of clusters in advance, and fix k during the clustering process. In this paper, we propose SERVICECLUSTER, a novel heterogeneous SERVICE network CLUSTERing algorithm with four unique features. First, we incorporate various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>entity,</b> attribute and link information into a unified distance measure. Second, we design a Discrete Steepest Descent method to naturally produce initial k and initial centroids simultaneously.
