The label began sending the copies out as promotional recordings, prompting Diplo <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remaining copies to be returned {{so that he could}} distribute them at shows and in clubs, which he felt was a more appropriate method of distribution for the mixtape.

5|$|Alboin first {{distinguished}} {{himself on}} the battlefield in a clash with the Gepids. At the Battle of Asfeld (552), he killed Turismod, son of the Gepid king Thurisind, in a victory {{that resulted in the}} Emperor Justinian's intervention to maintain equilibrium between the rival regional powers. After the battle, according to a tradition reported by Paul the Deacon, to be granted the right to sit at his father's table, Alboin had <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> hospitality of a foreign king and have him donate his weapons, as was customary. For this initiation, he went to the court of Thurisind, where the Gepid king gave him Turismod's arms. Walter Goffart believes it is probable that in this narrative Paul was making use of an oral tradition, and is sceptical that it can be dismissed as merely a typical topos of an epic poem.|$|E
5|$|Sridhar remade {{the film}} in Hindi as Dil Ek Mandir (1963) and in Telugu as Manase Mandiram (1966). It was also remade in Malayalam as Hridayam Oru Kshethram and in Kannada as Kumkuma Rakshe (1977). California-based Indian filmmaker Jag Mundhra was keen on remaking Dil Ek Mandir in English and Hindi, effecting some {{marginal}} changes in the film treatment. Mundhra met Sridhar <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rights to the film's script only to learn that Sridhar had assigned it to a film financier for a paltry sum, for eternity. The financier demanded an exorbitant fee for giving up the rights. The fee amounted to 75% of Mundhra's budget.|$|E

5|$|The six {{warehouse}} workers win $950,000in {{a lottery}} pool, and quit in a celebratory fashion of {{running through the}} office, making a mess and mooning the staff. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) was originally part of the pool but stopped when he was promoted, and falls into a depression, unable to find any motivation to work and further dismayed when his ex-wife's response to him not winning is <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> phone number of his pool-winner friend Glenn. Everyone else speculates how they would spend a hypothetical lottery score, with Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) ultimately deciding to fuse their two main ideas into one for a lovely brownstone located in the great outdoors.|$|E
5|$|Unknown to Montgomery, he was {{promoted}} to major general on December 9 for his victories at St. Johns and Montreal. After Montgomery was unable to convince Carleton to surrender, he placed several mortars a few hundred yards outside the walls of the city. The shelling of the city began on December 9, but after several days it had failed to make a serious impact on the walls, the garrison, or the civilian population. With the shelling having little effect, Montgomery ordered the emplacement of another battery closer towards the city walls, on the Plains of Abraham, despite the fact it offered little natural cover from returning fire. On December 15, the new batteries were ready and Montgomery sent a party of men under the flag of truce <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> city's surrender. However, they were turned away. Montgomery then resumed firing on the city, but the effect was little better. When the new batteries were hit by more effective fire from the British, Montgomery ordered their evacuation.|$|E
