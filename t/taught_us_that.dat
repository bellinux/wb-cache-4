Over the 500 {{days following the}} Gdańsk Agreement, 9–10 million workers, intellectuals and students joined it or its suborganizations, such as the Independent Student Union (Niezależne Zrzeszenie Studentów, created in September 1980), the Independent Farmers' Trade Union (NSZZ Rolników Indywidualnych [...] "Solidarność" [...] or Rural Solidarity, created in May 1981) and the Independent Craftsmen's Trade Union.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Isobel" [...] was filmed {{for two days}} in a forest in Dolgellau, near Llangollen, Wales. The crew used a Mitchell S35 camera with varispeed {{to be able to}} rewind the camera and do superimpositions and masks, {{inspired}} by Georges Méliès' work. The final music video was projected in 35mm for the crew in a cinema in London; with its varying exposures, lighting effects and monochromatic scheme, it resembles an early film. [...] "Isobel" [...] represents the story of the title character Björk envisioned with Sjón. It tells the story of [...] "a wild child discovering urban culture through installations of toy fighter planes", over lush superimposed imagery. Like in the lyrics, where Björk takes the role of narrator and protagonist, she plays two different parts in the music video: Björk is seen as the Isobel who [...] "weaves and composes this world and this story on her organ", and as the Isobel who inhabits this primal world. Water is the primary feature of her world, Gondry using it as a dreamy transition tool between scenes. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine included the video in his list of the Top 10 Björk Music Videos, describing it as [...] "surreal [...] visually striking". Ed Gonzalez of the same publication described it as [...] "Jean Epstein-ian kabuki horror." [...] The music video for [...] "Hyperballad" [...] has been described as [...] "a techno-dream visual story full of flashing lights, buzzing static, and holograms." [...] It shows Björk as [...] "a character running through a landscape that simulates that of a computer game, only to throw herself off a cliff." [...] The clip is an attempt to reflect the song's story, so Gondry depicted Björk lying down as a dead body, with a holographic image of her singing superimposed on her. Rick Poynor writes, [...] "White metamorphosed her head, using cyberscan data, into a stone." [...] The video demonstrated the musician's [...] " [...] the computer's shape-shifting powers." [...] Music writer Carol Vernallis felt Gondry developed texture with an aesthetic that does not become [...] "too coy or sickly sweet" [...] by incorporating [...] "a whiff of death"; pointing out that in the video, [...] "Björk's head resembles a death mask". Henry Keazor and Thorsten Wübbena considered that the clip [...] " [...] <b>taught</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> electronic bodies are rather intangible, dematerialized, purer in a certain way." [...] The music video, with its play on the boundaries between real and virtual, has been absorbed by club culture, {{as a representative of the}} scene's visual forms of expression.|$|E

[...] The character has also received positive attention from feminist critics; in her article [...] "12 Life Lessons 'Kim Possible' <b>Taught</b> <b>Us</b> <b>That</b> Are Still Pretty Relevant", Kadeen Griffiths of Bustle described Kim as an [...] "amazingly feminist" [...] character [...] "that taught girls that it was okay to overachieve, that worrying about boys didn't make you any less of a hero, and that you could invent your own slang and still sound (sort of) cool." [...] Griffiths went on to hail the character as [...] "our cartoon idol when it came to reaching for the stars and pulling it off flawlessly", concluding, [...] "at {{the end of the day}} Kim Possible could do anything.

[...] BuzzFeed ranked Kim ninth on its list of [...] "17 Characters From Your Childhood That Were More Feminist Than You Remember", with author Ellie Bate crediting the character with [...] "break the sexist stereotype that all cheerleaders are nothing but bimbos". Bustle writer Sarah Freymiller agreed that [...] "Kim offers a model for femininity that both bolsters and works against the typical 'high school cheerleader' stereotype."

While ranking Kim Possible: So the Drama the 12th most feminist Disney Channel Original Movie, Priya Krishna of BuzzFeed described Kim as [...] "obviously great". Comparing Kim to comic book superheroine Wonder Woman, Kathryn Shattuck of The New York Times wrote, [...] "MOVE over, boy wonders. The newest superhero on the block doesn't need a gimmicky mask or a jolt of testosterone to get the job done ... Kim Possible is ready and able to rescue humankind from evildoers without sacrificing her interest in boys and clothes." [...] However, in her book Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection, author Lyn Mikel Brown dismissed Kim as both a feminist and role model because of her alleged reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the observation that [...] "Her biggest threat is not evil, in fact, but the head cheerleader". Since her debut, Kim has proven herself a popular character among both girls and boys, although McCorkle admitted that [...] "whenever you have a girl in the lead doing all the action stuff, there’s a certain age group of boys who won’t admit they like the stuff. They really want to see the boy in that role." [...] McCorkle recalled an incident in which a fan of the show was very much surprised to learn that the writers were actually men upon meeting them; the fan had always just assumed that they were both young women because of the way in which they characterized Kim. At one point, fans of the character had sent her over one million e-mails via her interactive website.|$|E
