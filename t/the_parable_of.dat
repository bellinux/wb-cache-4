25|$|In addition, some Christian {{authors have}} argued that this typological {{interpretation}} finds its origin in the speech of Saint Stephen in Acts , {{as well as the}} Gospel of Luke and the parables of Jesus, noting strong verbal and conceptual collocation between the Greek translation of the portion of Genesis concerning Joseph and <b>the</b> <b>Parable</b> <b>of</b> the Wicked Tenants and <b>the</b> <b>Parable</b> <b>of</b> the Prodigal Son.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>parables</b> <b>of</b> Jesus: Allegories or {{symbols of}} social transformation? This article {{reflects}} on a possible methodology {{that can be}} used to interpret <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> <b>of</b> Jesus preserved in the Synoptics (and the Gospel of Thomas). It is argued that the available versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> <b>of</b> Jesus have already been allegorised, and that this should be taken into consideration when <b>the</b> extant versions <b>of</b> <b>parables</b> are interpreted as <b>parables</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical Jesus. <b>The</b> <b>parables</b> should also, as far as possible, be interpreted against the social realia evoked by <b>the</b> <b>parables.</b> In this endeavour, Roman-Egypt inscriptions and papyri are in most cases the only sources available. The article concludes with a few examples, illustrating the possibilities of interpretation when the proposed methodology is applied...|$|R

25|$|While {{it can be}} {{understood}} in Gnostic terms, it lacks the characteristic features of Gnostic doctrine. The Jesus Seminar identified two of its unique parables, <b>the</b> <b>parable</b> <b>of</b> the empty jar and <b>the</b> <b>parable</b> <b>of</b> the assassin. It had been lost but was discovered, in a Coptic version dating from c. 350, at Nag Hammadi in 1945–46, and three papyri, dated to c. 200, which contain fragments of a Greek text similar to but not identical with that in the Coptic language, have also been found.|$|E
