Read-Only Memory ran a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign in November 2013 to fund the book's publication. Supporters received perks including archival prints from Sonic series creator Naoto Oshima.

Rutherford continued to call himself a Liberal, but criticized the incumbent administration for the growth of the provincial debt and for letting the party fall into disarray. Calling the Charles Stewart-led government [...] "rotten" [...] and holding a grudge against cabinet minister John R. Boyle in particular, he offered voters the slogan [...] "get rid of the barnacles and the Boyles", a homonymic reference to the parasitic growth {{on the side of a}} ship.

Harrison wrote, [...] "I'm <b>thrilled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Grimes shine in his starring role.

When Stewie consumes all of the food in the house, he applies for a job at fast food restaurant McBurgertown, but is eventually fired for stealing food (despite his insistence it was due to be thrown out anyway).

Overall, the episode was well received by critics. Nina Hämmerling Smith of TV Guide quoted: [...] "Perhaps {{the best thing about}} the episode was the amount of screen time given to old favorites like Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) and Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). The show's most convincing writing has always been in the scenes when those two spar with House, and I was <b>thrilled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> more of that". Most critics were surprised and interested by the performance of Chris Taub in this episode. Richard Keller of TV Squad, wrote that he was almost certain of the fact that Taub was going to be fired and he was glad that he wasn't. He also quoted, [...] "For some reason I like Taub. Maybe because he's not pretty like the rest of them. He's just an everyday schlub who's a pretty decent doctor".|$|E

Dwight comes to the rescue when he manages to pair each of them with members of a women's basketball team, who are also waiting in line. Inside the club, Ryan's dancing becomes erratic and aggressive, and he accidentally hits a girl, prompting her friends to attack Ryan. Dwight and Michael escort him out of the club, and after Troy advises them not to take Ryan to a hospital, he runs off. Michael and Dwight bring Ryan back to his apartment, where he tells them that he thinks his [...] "friend Troy" [...] has a drug problem, and asks what he should do about it. Michael, oblivious to the fact that Ryan is obviously referring to his own drug addiction, gives him hypothetical advice involving a wiretap and snitching on a drug dealer.

Fay stood on another rim, looking down. He saw that the slide had moved far out into the valley, and {{the lower part of}} it consisted of great sections of wall. In fact, the base of the great wall had just moved out with the avalanche, and this much of it held its vertical position.

60|$|How {{wonderful}} to watch eagles {{in their native}} haunts! I saw a bald eagle sail by, and then two golden eagles winging heavy flight after him. There seemed to be contention or rivalry, for when the white-headed bird alighted the others swooped down upon him. They circled and flew {{in and out of}} the cañon, and one let out a shrill, piercing scream. They disappeared and I watched a lonely gull riding the swells. He at least was at home on the restless waters. Life is beautiful, particularly elemental life. Then far above I saw the white-tipped eagle and I <b>thrilled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the difference now in his flight. He was monarch of the air, king of the wind, lonely and grand in the blue. He soared, he floated, he sailed, and then, away across the skies he flew, swift as an arrow, to slow and circle again, and swoop up high and higher, wide-winged and free, ringed in the azure blue, and then like a thunderbolt he fell, to vanish beyond the crags.|$|E

His sad case fascinated me. It was rather <b>thrilling</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him wrestling with New Zealand mutton-hash and draught beer down at his Chelsea flat, with all the suppressed anguish {{of a man who has}} let himself get accustomed to delicate food and vintage wines, and think that a word from him could send him whizzing back to the old life again whenever he wished.

Thus decided, she lay back again in her covert and gave her mind over to pondering curiosity. Sooner than she expected she espied Isbel approaching through the forest, empty handed. He had not taken his rifle. Ellen averted her glance a moment and <b>thrilled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the rifle leaning against a rock. Verily Jean Isbel had been far removed from hostile intent that day. She watched him stride swiftly up to his horse, untie the halter, and mount. Ellen had an impression of his arrowlike straight figure, and sinuous grace and ease. Then he looked back at the promontory, as if to fix a picture of it in his mind, and rode away along the Rim. She watched him out of sight. What ailed her? Something was wrong with her, but she recognized only relief.|$|E

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{understood}} that different ways of speaking {{about the same thing}} may obtain drastically different psychological functions and, thereby, occasion different patterns of responding. Knowledge of this phenomenon has afforded powerful application in the rhetoric of political discourse.

Characters who were sorely missed in Feast - Daenerys Targaryen, Tyrion Lannister, and Jon Snow - {{make up more than}} a third of the novel, and Martin is wise enough to give us at least a chapter from (almost) everyone else. Weaknesses that have plagued Martin's previous books are also present: too much repetition, unexceptional prose, and characters who use the same idioms (and have sex in exactly the same manner) no matter their ethnicity, social class, or continent. But while A Dance with Dragons cries out for better editing, it remains entirely engrossing.
