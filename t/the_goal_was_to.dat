After limited initial gains by the Germans, the Americans halted the offensive. By 25 January, Operation North Wind had officially ended.|$|E
5|$|PONIE is {{an acronym}} for Perl On New Internal Engine. The PONIE Project existed from 2003 until 2006 and {{was to be a}} bridge between Perl 5 and Perl 6. It was an effort to rewrite the Perl 5 {{interpreter}} to run on Parrot, the Perl 6 virtual machine. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> ensure the future of the millions of lines of Perl 5 code at thousands of companies around the world.|$|E
5|$|The regime {{promoted}} {{the concept of}} Volksgemeinschaft, a national German ethnic community. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> build a classless society based on racial purity and the perceived need to prepare for warfare, conquest and a struggle against Marxism. The German Labour Front founded the Kraft durch Freude (KdF; Strength Through Joy) organisation in 1933. In addition to taking control {{of tens of thousands}} of previously privately run recreational clubs, it offered highly regimented holidays and entertainment such as cruises, vacation destinations and concerts.|$|E

5|$|The {{use of an}} {{aluminium}} {{body was}} controversial, and international experts recommended that the tram company should not choose that solution. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> decrease the weight so the trams could operate with less-powerful motors, giving a lower cost. The first prototype was a full-scale model of a tram, built at Homansbyen Depot in 1935, using an undercarriage from disused horsecars.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} seven {{companies}} began the development of USB in 1994: Compaq, DEC, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NEC, and Nortel. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make it fundamentally easier to connect external devices to PCs by replacing the multitude of connectors {{at the back of}} PCs, addressing the usability issues of existing interfaces, and simplifying software configuration of all devices connected to USB, as well as permitting greater data rates for external devices. A team including Ajay Bhatt worked on the standard at Intel; the first integrated circuits supporting USB were produced by Intel in 1995.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a low-maintenance {{experiment}} was the protein crystal growth experiment, which had also been flown on previous shuttle missions. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> produce better protein crystallizations than those produced on the Earth, and hence allowing for a more accurate model of protein structures. Of the 23 proteins and viruses attempted during Expedition 1, only four resulted in successful crystallizations, which was a lower success rate than predicted. Of those successful was the low-calorie sweetener Thaumatin, whose crystals diffracted at a higher resolution than Earth-grown crystal, {{which resulted in a}} more accurate protein structure model.|$|E

5|$|At first glance, dazzle {{seems an}} {{unlikely}} form of camouflage, {{drawing attention to}} the ship rather than hiding it. The approach was developed after Allied navies were unable to develop effective means to hide ships in all weather conditions. The British zoologist John Graham Kerr proposed the application of camouflage to British warships in the First World War, outlining what he {{believed to be the}} applicable principle, disruptive camouflage, in a letter to Winston Churchill in 1914 explaining <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> confuse, not to conceal, by disrupting a ship's outline. Kerr compared the effect to that created by the patterns on a series of land animals, the giraffe, zebra and jaguar.|$|E
5|$|Doug Kaufman, a co-designer of Civilization II, {{was invited}} to join {{development}} as a game balancer. Reynolds cited the Alpha Centauris balance for the greater sense of urgency and the more pressing pacing than in his earlier game, Sid Meier's Colonization. According to producer Timothy Train, in designing {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the factions, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> suggest, without requiring, certain strategies and give the player interesting and fun things to do without unbalancing the game. He didn't want a faction to be dependent on its strength or a faction's power to be dominant over the rest. Train felt that fun meant the factions always have something fun to do with their attributes.|$|E
5|$|Following {{extensive}} {{discussions on}} the fighting ability of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, the Political Bureau approved the General Staff’s plan, which had selected the Central Highlands as the main battlefield for the upcoming offensive. The Central Highlands campaign was codenamed ‘Campaign 275’ and <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> capture the city of Ban Me Thuot. To achieve that objective, North Vietnamese General Văn Tiến Dũng placed great emphasis {{on the principles of}} massed force, secrecy, and surprise to draw South Vietnamese forces away from the main objective. For the element of surprise to be successful, North Vietnamese forces needed to launch strong diversionary attacks on Pleiku and Kon Tum, thereby leaving Ban Me Thuot completely exposed. Once the element of surprise had been achieved, the North Vietnamese would mass their forces on Ban Me Thuot, and prevent South Vietnamese reinforcements from retaking the city.|$|E

5|$|In 1673, Jeremiah Horrocks {{published}} a reasonably accurate {{model of the}} Moon's motion in which the Moon was assumed to follow a precessing elliptical orbit. A sufficiently accurate and simple method for predicting the Moon's motion would have solved the navigational problem of determining a ship's longitude; in Newton's time, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> predict the Moon's position to 2' (two arc-minutes), which would correspond to a 1° error in terrestrial longitude. Horrocks' model predicted the lunar position with errors no more than 10 arc-minutes; for comparison, {{the diameter of the}} Moon is roughly 30 arc-minutes.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, an Australian-based company OnTilt Designs Pty Ltd won a multi-year {{contract}} {{to become the}} official bracelet manufacturer for the WSOP. OnTilt jewelers decided that the 2010 bracelet design {{would return to the}} tradition of the 1970s and 1980s where the bracelet was a heavy piece of unadorned metal. American jewelry designer Steve Soffa was chosen to design and manufacture the entire set of bracelets. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create a bracelet that somebody would actually want to wear every day. In 2011, OnTilt has also been chosen to manufacture the WSOP Circuit rings.|$|E
5|$|Innocence began {{production}} in 2006 at Alfa System {{as the next}} main entry in the Tales series. Developed parallel to the DS spin-off title Tales of the Tempest, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> include all the series' main gameplay and narrative elements despite the limited medium. The character designs were done by Mutsumi Inomata, while the music was composed by series newcomer Kazuhiro Nakamura. Extensive voice acting was included using CRI Middleware's Kyuseishu Sound Streamer compression algorithm. After release, {{it was decided to}} remake Innocence for the Vita, using platform-specific gameplay functions, redone voice work and music, and new characters. Japanese singer-songwriter Kokia created the opening theme songs for both versions of Innocence. Both versions have been positively received in Japan, and Western opinions on the two versions of Innocence have been mostly positive.|$|E

5|$|Maverick Hunter was in {{development}} by Armature Studio and {{was to be}} published by Capcom for the Mega Man X series. The collaboration was established by Keiji Inafune, who had previously worked on the Mega Man series as an artist and producer. He had since rose in the ranks at Capcom to become a producer. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> attract a new audience to the Mega Man series. Its development would have been overseen by former Capcom producer Ben Judd. The redesign for the Mega Man character was to be done by Adi Granov (the concept artist responsible for the Iron Man redesign found in the 2008 film of the same name). An initial concept design showed X with a red glowing 'X' on his face.|$|E
5|$|SR209 was {{designated}} in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Plans for an interchange between I-5, I-8, SR 209, and SR 109 date from 1965, although several concerns {{had to be}} taken into account, including the preservation of historical Old Town and keeping traffic through the area moving during construction. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> begin construction in 1966, and complete the interchange in 1969. There were concerns about a $3 billion shortfall in funding during May 1966, which caused the San Diego Chamber of Commerce Highway Committee to recommend the completion of SR 109 as a project.|$|E
5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. He only spent little time on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the first game's story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix's personality as he went along. He came up with the partner character Maya because he thought it would be more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own.|$|E
