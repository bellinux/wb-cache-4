The deeper the water, <b>the</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> species found, and the larger the species tended to be. The giant isopods found in very deep waters off Australia were compared to those found off Mexico and India. From the fossil record it is thought that Bathynomus existed more than 160 million years ago, so it did not evolve independently in all three locations, but since then it would be expected that Bathynomus would show divergent evolution in the various locations. However the giant isopods in all three locations were almost identical in appearance (although there are some differences, and they are separate species). This reduced phenotypic divergence is linked to the extremely low light levels of their habitat.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the launch}} {{was not without}} its {{problems}} when three major supermarkets did not stock copies. On launch day, Sainsbury's said that its tills had not been updated in time {{to enable them to}} sell the paper, but that it would begin doing so from the following day, while Tesco and Morrisons planned to monitor sales before deciding whether or not to stock it. Morrisons also said that it did not have the space to sell the newspaper without doing so at the expense of local titles. On 27 November, The Guardian reported that the distribution issues had been resolved, while STV News suggested the distribution problems were responsible for <b>the</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> printed copies {{in the latter part of}} the launch week.

2500|$|Undergraduate {{courses in}} the {{humanities}} are traditionally either seminars or lectures held 2 or 3 times a week with an additional discussion seminar that is called a [...] "precept." [...] To graduate, all A.B. candidates must complete a senior thesis and, in most departments, one or two extensive pieces of independent research that are known as [...] "junior papers." [...] Juniors in some departments, including architecture and the creative arts, complete independent projects that differ from written research papers. A.B. candidates must also fulfill a three or four semester foreign language requirement and distribution requirements {{with a total of}} 31 classes. B.S.E. candidates follow a parallel track with an emphasis on a rigorous science and math curriculum, a computer science requirement, and at least two semesters of independent research including an optional senior thesis. All B.S.E. students must complete at least 36 classes. A.B. candidates typically have more freedom in course selection than B.S.E. candidates because of <b>the</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> required classes. Nonetheless, in the spirit of a liberal arts education, both enjoy a comparatively high degree of latitude in creating a self-structured curriculum.|$|E

50|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{have shown}} the ability to choose an array with fewer dots compared to one with more dots. Experimenters set up two boards showing various numbers of dots in a poolside setup. The dolphins were initially trained to choose the board with <b>the</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> dots. This was done by rewarding the dolphin when it chose the board with <b>the</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> dots. In the experimental trials, two boards were set up, and the dolphin would emerge from the water and point to one board. The dolphins chose the arrays with fewer dots at a rate much larger than chance, indicating they can differentiate between quantities.A particular grey parrot, after training, has shown the ability to differentiate between the numbers zero through six using vocalizations. After number and vocalization training, this was done by asking the parrot how many objects there were in a display. The parrot was {{able to identify the}} correct amount at a rate higher than chance.Angelﬁsh, when put in an unfamiliar environment will group together with conspecifics, an action named shoaling. Given the choice between two groups of differing size, the angelfish will choose the larger of the two groups. This can be seen with a discrimination ratio of 2:1 or greater, such that, as long as one group has at least twice the fish as another group, it will join the larger one.|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{increased}} circuit complexity, and time-to-market shrinking, {{the need for}} verification of application-specific-integrated-circuit (ASIC) and system-on-chip (SoC) designs is growing. Hardware platforms are becoming more prominent amongst verification engineers due {{to the ability to}} test system designs at-speed with on-chip bus clocks, as compared to simulation clocks which may not provide an accurate reading of system behavior. These multi-million gate designs usually are placed in a multi-FPGA prototyping platform with six or more FPGAs, since they are unable to fit entirely onto a single FPGA. <b>The</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> FPGAs the design has to be partitioned to reduces the effort from the design engineer.
