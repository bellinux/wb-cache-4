25|$|A 2013 Cochrane Systematic Review {{compared}} {{the effect of}} brimonidine and <b>timolol</b> in slowing the progression of open angle glaucoma in adult participants. The results showed that participants assigned to brimonidine showed less visual field progression that those assigned to <b>timolol,</b> though the results were not significant, given the heavy loss-to-followup and limited evidence. The mean intraocular pressures for both groups were similar. Participants in the brimonidine group had a higher occurrence of side effects caused by medication than participants in the <b>timolol</b> group.|$|E

2500|$|Diagnosis is made {{by looking}} for cupping of the optic nerve. Prostaglandin {{agonists}} work by opening uveoscleral passageways. [...] Beta-blockers, such as <b>timolol,</b> work by decreasing aqueous formation. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decrease bicarbonate formation from ciliary processes in the eye, thus decreasing the formation of Aqueous humor. [...] Parasympathetic analogs are drugs that work on the trabecular outflow by opening up the passageway and constricting the pupil. Alpha 2 agonists (brimonidine, apraclonidine) both decrease fluid production (via. inhibition of AC) and increase drainage.|$|E
2500|$|The β-adrenergic {{receptor}} antagonists {{all have}} similar therapeutic and pharmacodynamic actions {{in patients with}} cardiovascular disorders. They vary greatly in their pharmacokinetic properties, as they demonstrate a high range of values in plasma protein binding, the percent of drug eliminated by metabolism or unchanged in the urine and hepatic extraction ratio. [...] Each of the β-blockers possesses at least one chiral centre and {{a high degree of}} enantioselectivity when binding to the β-adrenergic receptor. For those β-blockers containing a single chiral centre, the (-) enantiomer has a much higher affinity in binding to the β-adrenergic receptor than the (+) enantiomer. All β-blockers used systemically are delivered as racemate, except for <b>timolol.</b>|$|E
50|$|Neither {{brimonidine}} tartrate nor <b>timolol</b> maleate was mutagenic in {{in vitro}} and in vivo studies. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats {{did not reveal}} any adverse effects on male or female fertility with brimonidine tartrate or <b>timolol</b> maleate.|$|E
5000|$|Two prospective, randomized, double-blinded, phase III {{clinical}} trials were conducted at 53 {{sites in the}} United States to compare the IOP-lowering efficacy and safety of 0.2% brimonidine tartrate/0.5% <b>timolol</b> maleate fixed combination twice daily with 0.2% brimonidine tartrate three times daily or 0.5% <b>timolol</b> maleate twice daily in patients aged 18 or older who had ocular hypertension or glaucoma. When assessed over a 3-month period, pooled results from a total of 1159 patients showed significantly greater mean IOP decrease from baseline with the brimonidine/timolol combination (4.9-7.6 mmHg) than with brimonidine monotherapy (3.1-5.5 mmHg) or <b>timolol</b> monotherapy (4.3-6.2 mmHg) across all follow-up visits. Similar efficacy results were reported during 12-month follow-up: mean IOP decrease from baseline was 4.4-7.6 mmHg with brimonidine/timolol combination, compared to 2.7-5.5 mmHg with brimonidine and 3.9-6.2 mmHg with <b>timolol.</b> The incidence of treatment-related adverse events with the brimonidine/timolol combination was lower than that with brimonidine monotherapy but higher than that with <b>timolol</b> monotherapy.|$|E

50|$|<b>Timolol</b> is marketed under many {{trade names}} worldwide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Timolol</b> was {{patented}} in 1968 {{and came}} into medical use in 1978. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Timolol</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.86 to 2.29 USD per 5 ml bottle. In the United States it costs 25 to 50 USD per month.|$|E
50|$|A 12-week prospective, randomized, double-blinded {{study in}} 371 {{glaucoma}} and ocular hypertension patients with inadequate IOP control on monotherapy compared the efficacy {{and safety of}} 0.2% brimonidine tartrate/0.5% <b>timolol</b> fixed combination twice daily with the concomitant use of 0.2% brimonidine tartrate twice daily and <b>timolol</b> 0.5% twice daily. The IOP-lowering effect of the fixed combination group was shown to be non-inferior to that of concomitant therapy. Incidence of adverse events was similar between groups.|$|E
50|$|Both {{brimonidine}} 0.2% and <b>timolol</b> 0.5% {{are commonly}} used ophthalmic solutions for lowering IOP. <b>Timolol</b> 0.5% is dosed one drop once or twice daily, while brimonidine 0.2% is dosed one drop three times daily. For patients who need more than one medication to lower IOP, the fixed combination product offers the advantages of {{reducing the number of}} drops and medication bottles, improving patient compliance, and decreasing ocular exposure to preservatives in ophthalmic solutions.|$|E

5000|$|... == Pharmacology == Combigan is {{composed}} of brimonidine, a selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, and <b>timolol,</b> a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor. Elevated IOP is considered the only modifiable risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. Brimonidine exerts its ocular hypotensive effect by decreasing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow, while <b>timolol</b> acts by reducing aqueous humor production. Combigan has a fast onset of action, and the peak IOP lowering effect occurs at two hours after administration.|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of brinzolamide with <b>timolol</b> is marketed under the trade name Azarga. This combination {{may be more}} effective than either medication alone.|$|E
50|$|Bimatoprost is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension in adult patients, either alone or in combination with a beta blocker (typically <b>timolol).</b>|$|E
50|$|Brimonidine is {{indicated}} for the lowering of intraocular pressure {{in patients with}} open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. It is also the active ingredient of Combigan along with <b>timolol</b> maleate.|$|E
50|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{can either}} reduce or increase {{the effect of}} tafluprost. <b>Timolol</b> eye drops, a common kind of glaucoma medication, does not negatively interact with this drug.|$|E
50|$|The {{most serious}} {{possible}} side effects include cardiac arrhythmias and severe bronchospasms. <b>Timolol</b> {{can also lead}} to fainting, congestive heart failure, depression, confusion, worsening of Raynaud's syndrome and impotence.|$|E
50|$|Latanoprost/timolol (trade name Xalacom) is a {{combination}} drug used in glaucoma, consisting of latanoprost (increase uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humor) and <b>timolol</b> (a beta blocker decreasing the production of aqueous fluid).|$|E
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} bimatoprost {{to be more}} {{effective}} than <b>timolol</b> in reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) and as least as effective as the prostaglandin analogs latanoprost and travoprost in reducing IOP.|$|E
50|$|No {{carcinogenic}} {{effects were}} found with brimonidine tartrate in mice or rats. With <b>timolol</b> maleate, 300 mg/kg/day in rats (equivalent to about 42,000 times systemic exposure following the maximum recommended ocular dose in human MRHOD) {{was associated with}} significantly increased incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in a two-year study; in a lifetime study in mice, 500 mg/kg/day (equivalent to about 71,000 times systemic exposure following the MRHOD) but not 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (about 700 or 7,000 times systemic exposure following the MRHOD) of <b>timolol</b> maleate was associated with significantly increased incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas.|$|E
50|$|Meta-analysis {{suggests}} that latanoprost {{is more effective}} than <b>timolol</b> in lowering IOP. However, it often causes iris pigmentation. While current evidence {{suggests that}} this pigmentation is benign, careful lifetime evaluation of patients is still justified.|$|E
50|$|Beta blockers, {{the second}} most common {{treatment}} method for glaucoma, reduce the production of aqueous humor. They are relatively inexpensive and are available in generic form. <b>Timolol,</b> Levobunolol, and Betaxolol are common beta blockers prescribed to treat glaucoma.|$|E
50|$|No {{interaction}} {{studies with}} this substance have been performed. Interactions with systemic (for example, oral) drugs are considered unlikely because bimatoprost does not reach relevant {{concentrations in the}} bloodstream. Bimatoprost does not negatively interact with <b>timolol</b> eye drops.|$|E
5000|$|In glaucoma, {{drainage}} {{is reduced}} ( [...] open-angle glaucoma) or blocked completely (closed-angle glaucoma). In such cases, beta-2 stimulation with its consequent increase in humour production is highly contra-indicated, and conversely, a topical beta-2 antagonist such as <b>timolol</b> may be employed.|$|E
5000|$|When {{symptoms}} are sufficiently troublesome to warrant treatment, the first medication choices are beta blockers such as propranolol or alternately, nadolol and <b>timolol.</b> Atenolol and pindolol are not effective for tremor. [...] The anti-epileptic primidone is also effective for ET.|$|E
50|$|The beta-blocker, propranalol's {{effectiveness}} in headache treatment {{was a chance}} finding in patients receiving the drug for angina (chest pain {{due to a lack}} of blood to the heart muscle). The beta-blockers that are used in migraine treatment are propranolol, nadolol, <b>timolol,</b> metoprolol, and atenolol.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} drugs can cause {{changes in the}} retina {{that can lead to}} macular edema. The effect of each drug is {{variable}} and some drugs have a lesser role in causation. The principal medication known to affect the retina are:- latanoprost, epinephrine, rosiglitazone, <b>timolol</b> and thiazolidinediones among others.|$|E
50|$|Brimonidine/timolol (INNs, {{trade name}} Combigan) are {{combination}} eye drops indicated {{for the treatment}} of glaucoma. It is a combination of brimonidine (an α2 adrenergic agonist) and <b>timolol</b> (a β adrenergic blocker), in concentrations of 0.2% and 0.5% respectively. Both substances work by decreasing the synthesis of aqueous humor.|$|E
50|$|In its eye drop form {{it is used}} {{to treat}} open-angle and, occasionally, {{secondary}} glaucoma. The mechanism of action of <b>timolol</b> is probably the reduction of the formation of aqueous humor in the ciliary body in the eye. It was the first β blocker approved for topical use in treatment of glaucoma in the USA (1978). When used by itself, it depresses intraocular pressure (IOP) 18-34% below baseline within first few treatments. However, there are short-term escape and long-term drift effects in some patients. That is, tolerance develops. It may reduce the extent of diurnal IOP curve up to 50%. IOP higher during sleep. It is 5-10× more potent β blocker than propranolol. <b>Timolol</b> is light-sensitive; it is usually preserved with 0.01% benzalkonium chloride (BAC), but also comes BAC-free. Can also be used in adjunctive therapy with pilocarpine or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.|$|E
