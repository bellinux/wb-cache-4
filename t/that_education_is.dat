5|$|Compulsory {{education}} or grunnskóli (lit. “basic school”), is {{the period of}} education which is compulsory for all. The legislation concerning compulsory education was passed in 2007, and in 1996 municipalities took over the running of compulsory education. It comprises primary and lower secondary education, which often {{takes place at the}} same institution. The law states <b>that</b> <b>education</b> <b>is</b> mandatory for children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 16. The school year lasts nine months, and begins between August 21 and September 1, ending between May 31 and June 10. The minimum number of school days is 170, but after a new teachers’ wage contract, this will increase to 180. Lessons take place five days a week.|$|E

25|$|In a {{study of}} normal aging, {{education}} {{was found to be}} related to levels of cognitive functioning but unrelated to rates of cognitive change, suggesting that cognitive reserve reflects the persistence of earlier differences in cognitive functioning rather than differential rates of age-associated cognitive declines. Studies controlling for practice effects indicate <b>that</b> <b>education</b> <b>is</b> not a direct cause of cognitive reserve.|$|E

Ever since we first raised this issue some years ago there still has not been an {{adequate}} repudiation of incitement by the Palestinian Authority.

25|$|When {{marginal}} {{social costs}} of production are {{less than that of}} the private cost function, we see the occurrence of a positive externality of production. Production of public goods are a textbook example of production that create positive externalities. An example of such a public good, which creates a divergence in social and private costs, includes the production of education. It is often seen <b>that</b> <b>education</b> <b>is</b> a positive for any whole society, as well as a positive for those directly involved in the market.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{the premise}} <b>that</b> <b>education</b> <b>is</b> a {{fundamental}} factor in the regional integration process, educational courses at the primary or junior high level, provided {{that they do not}} entail technical studies, will be recognized by member states as being on the same level for all member nations. Likewise, to facilitate continuing education, course certificates issued by an institution accredited in one of the member states is valid in all other member states. Nontechnical primary and junior high level studies that have not been completed are accredited by any member state, thereby allowing course conclusion in another member nation. Studies are completed using an equivalency table to determine the level achieved.|$|E

50|$|In 1838, {{he founded}} and edited The Common School Journal. In this journal, Mann {{targeted}} {{the public school}} and its problems. His six main principles were: (1) the public should no longer remain ignorant; (2) <b>that</b> such <b>education</b> should <b>be</b> paid for, controlled, and sustained by an interested public; (3) <b>that</b> this <b>education</b> will <b>be</b> best provided in schools that embrace children {{from a variety of}} backgrounds; (4) <b>that</b> this <b>education</b> must <b>be</b> non-sectarian; (5) <b>that</b> this <b>education</b> must <b>be</b> taught by the spirit, methods, and discipline of a free society; and (6) <b>that</b> <b>education</b> should <b>be</b> provided by well-trained, professional teachers. Mann worked for more and better-equipped school houses, longer school years (until 16 years old), higher pay for teachers, and a wider curriculum.|$|R
25|$|In 2005, the German Federal Constitutional Court {{ruled that}} a federal law prohibiting tuition fees was unconstitutional, on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>education</b> <b>is</b> the sole {{responsibility}} of the states. Following this ruling, seven federal states introduced tuition fees of €500 per semester in 2006 and 2007. Due to massive student protests and a citizens' initiative which collected 70,000 signatures against tuition fees, the government of Hesse {{was the first to}} reverse course before the state election in 2008; other state governments soon followed. Several parties which spoke out for tuition fees lost state elections. Bavaria in 2013 and Lower Saxony in 2014 were the last states to abolish tuition fees.|$|E
25|$|Once {{thought to}} face {{extinction}} as a race or culture, Native Americans of numerous tribes have achieved revival of {{aspects of their}} cultures, together with asserting their sovereignty and direction of their own affairs since the mid-20th century. Many have started language programs to revive use of traditional languages; some have established tribally controlled colleges and other schools on their reservations, so <b>that</b> <b>education</b> <b>is</b> expressive of their cultures. Since the late 20th century, many tribes have developed gaming casinos on their sovereign land to raise revenues for economic development, {{as well as to}} promote the education and welfare of their people through health care and construction of improved housing.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopia faces many historical, cultural, {{social and}} {{political}} obstacles that have restricted progress in education for many centuries. According to UNESCO reviews, most people in Ethiopia feel that work {{is more important than}} education, so they start {{at a very early age}} with little to no education. Children in rural areas are less likely to go to school than children in urban areas. Though gradually improving, most rural families cannot afford to send their children to school because parents believe that while their children are in school they cannot contribute to the household chores and income. Social awareness <b>that</b> <b>education</b> <b>is</b> important is something that Ethiopia lacks but has improved gradually. There is a need to change the importance of education in the country's social structure, and children should be encouraged and required to attend school and become educated. The society of Ethiopia expects teachers and parents to use corporal punishment to maintain order and discipline. Most believe that through punishing children for bad habits they in turn learn good ones. Also since the mid-1970s there was a drastic loss of professionals who left the country, mostly for economical reasons. Many educated Ethiopians sought higher salaries in foreign countries thus many of those who managed to finish higher education emigrated from Ethiopia creating an endless shortage of qualified professionals in every sector of the country. Now the custom of sending academics abroad with the risk of a brain drain is being replaced by expansion of masters and doctoral programs to up-grade academic staff. Instead, foreigners have been funding programs for leadership, management and pedagogic skills or sending staff to help strengthen teaching and management practices.|$|E

500|$|Baker ran as {{a social}} liberal (in favor of gay {{marriage}} and abortion rights) but a fiscal conservative, stressing job creation as his primary focus. His campaign centered on [...] "Baker's Dozen", a plan outlining 13 areas of state government reform. Baker's campaign said that his plan, which included consolidation of government, welfare reform, and restructuring of public employee pension and retirement benefits, would lower state expenditures by over $1 billion. Baker, {{a former member of}} the Massachusetts Board of Education, advocated increasing the number of charter, magnet, and alternative schools. Believing <b>that</b> <b>education</b> <b>is</b> a [...] "civil right", he also aimed to close the educational achievement gap among underprivileged and minority students. At a town hall meeting in Chilmark, Massachusetts, on the island of Martha's Vineyard, Baker voiced his opposition to the proposed Cape Wind project supported by Governor Deval Patrick.|$|E

40|$|It <b>was</b> {{explained}} <b>that</b> <b>education</b> <b>was</b> {{not important}} in the earliest colonial period where the colony only contained small Hong Kong Island from 1841 to 1860. The disagreement of this conclusion was found and actually <b>education</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the major}} governmental concerns. Britain <b>was</b> starting <b>that</b> <b>education</b> should <b>be</b> funded by public money and the public <b>education</b> system <b>was</b> not yet well established at that time. The Hong Kong government laid special stress on educating Hong Kong pupils in order to facilitate governance, business and building community and citizenship of Hong Kong during this early colonial period. We can criticize the government which did not spend enough money for <b>education,</b> but it <b>is</b> observable <b>that</b> the <b>education</b> policy <b>was</b> initiated and adjusted to suit {{for the development of the}} community.

500|$|Locke {{does not}} {{dedicate}} much space in Some Thoughts Concerning Education to outlining a specific curriculum; {{he is more}} concerned with convincing his readers <b>that</b> <b>education</b> <b>is</b> about instilling virtue and what Western educators would now call critical-thinking skills. Locke maintains that parents or teachers must first teach children how to learn and to enjoy learning. As he writes, the instructor [...] "should remember that his business is not so much to teach [...] all that is knowable, as to raise in him a love and esteem of knowledge; and to put him in the right way of knowing and improving himself." [...] But Locke does offer a few hints as to what he thinks a valuable curriculum might be. He deplores the long hours wasted on learning Latin and argues that children should first be taught to speak and write well in their native language, particularly recommending Aesop's Fables. [...] Most of Locke's recommendations are based on a similar principle of utility. So, for example, he claims that children should be taught to draw because {{it would be useful to}} them on their foreign travels (for recording the sites they visit), but poetry and music, he says, are a waste of time. Locke was also at the forefront of the scientific revolution and advocated the teaching of geography, astronomy, and anatomy. Locke's curricular recommendations reflect the break from scholastic humanism and the emergence of a new kind of education—one emphasising not only science but also practical professional training. Locke also recommended, for example, that every (male) child learn a trade. Locke's pedagogical suggestions marked the beginning of a new bourgeois ethos that would come to define Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.|$|E
