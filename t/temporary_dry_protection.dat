40|$|Background: Vidian neurectomy {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a surgical option for rhinitis refractory to medical treatment. However, the evidence base for its benefit remains controversial. Methods: A systematic review was performed. Studies reporting original data on patients with rhinitis treated by vidian neurectomy were included. Patient-reported outcome measures were the primary outcome investigated; specific peri-operative morbidities were the secondary outcome. Results: A total of 1012 articles fulfilled the search criteria, 32 of which {{were included in the}} study. Patient-reported outcome measures were compared before and after surgery in eight studies. There were 529 patients represented in these trials.

40|$|For a {{wide range}} of organisms, {{dormancy}} is a strategy to overcome adverse conditions in time and space, and one may expect that the stress tolerance of dormant stages is tuned to the habitat in which they occur. We assessed the tolerance of vegetative and resting cells of 17 benthic diatom morphospecies from habitats with contrasting permanency, ranging from moist soils to permanent lakes. Vegetative cells of all morphospecies were highly sensitive to desiccation and, except for strains of some terrestrial taxa, freezing. In contrast, resting cells of several morphospecies tolerated desiccation, especially when preceded by a heat treatment, and resting cells of more strains and morphospecies survived freezing, albeit often with low survival percentages and a large interstrain variation. Strikingly, all strains surviving desiccation and/or freezing belonged to terrestrial morphospecies, i. e. diatoms occurring mainly in wet and moist or <b>temporary</b> <b>dry</b> habitats outside water bodies. These results emphasize the importance of resting cells of terrestrial diatoms for the survival of stress tolerance, especially desiccation, and indicate specific adaptations of terrestrial diatoms to their highly variable habitats...|$|R

METHODS: Sixty patients(60 eyes) who were diagnosed of juxtafoveal CSC were assigned randomly into 2 groups: 32 cases(32 eyes, therapeutic group) were injected subcutaneously compound anisodine injection for 2 mL q. d around superficial temporal arteries in the affected eyes; 28 cases(28 eyes, control group) received only traditional oral medication. Both groups received therapy for 2 to 4 courses of treatment. The main observations were the best corrected visual acuity(BCVA), subjective symptom, visual field, average light sensitivity and optical coherent topography(OCT). RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference between}} the therapeutic group and the control group before treatment(P > 0. 05), but all the outcome measures at 1, 3 mo in the treatment group were significantly improved as compared with control group(P P > 0. 05).

In contrast, the abdominal scales of an adult of the same species shows extensive reworking of the bone tissue. The scale grows by apposition of lamellar bone peripherally around the whole scale; the presence of Sharpey fibers in the periphery of the scales both basally and externally suggests that they remained deeply embedded in the dermis; the embryonic scale is completely remodelled in the adult by resorption and redeposition which produces a cancellous bone with large erosion bays and secondary osteons.

40|$|Background: Rivers {{around the}} world are drying with {{increasing}} frequency, but little is known about effects on terrestrial animal communities. Previous research along the San Pedro River in southeastern AZ, USA, suggests that changes in the availability of water resources associated with river drying lead to changes in predator abundance, community composition, diversity, and abundance of particular taxa of arthropods, but these observations have not yet been tested manipulatively. Methods and Results: In this study, we constructed artificial pools in the stream bed adjacent to a drying section of the San Pedro River and maintained them as the river dried. We compared pitfall trapped arthropods near artificial pools to adjacent control sites where surface waters temporarily dried. Assemblage composition changed differentially at multiple taxonomic levels, resulting in different assemblages at pools than at control sites, with multiple taxa and richness of carabid beetle genera increasing at pools but not at controls that dried. On the other hand, predator biomass, particularly wolf spiders, and diversity of orders and families were consistently higher at control sites that dried. These results suggest an important role for colonization dynamics of pools, as well as the ability of certain taxa, particularly burrowing wolf spiders, to withstand periods of <b>temporary</b> <b>drying.</b> Conclusions: Overall, we found some agreement between this manipulative study of water resources and a previous analysis of river drying that showed shifts in composition, changes in diversity, and declines in abundance of certain tax...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} drought on {{freshwater}} ecosystems {{is a growing}} environmental concern. This study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of the supra-seasonal 2010 - 2012 drought on the macroinvertebrate communities and functional feeding groups (FFG) of chalk streams. Three rivers were sampled during and after the drought, three sites were analysed on each river, a perennial control site, a dewatering site (shallow during drought) and a rewetted site (dry during drought). All wetted sites were sampled for macroinvertebrates, algae, velocity and depth monthly. In addition an in-situ experiment investigated grazing rates in dewatering, rewetted and perennial sites and a mesocosm experiment investigated the effect of reduced water velocity and <b>temporary</b> <b>drying</b> on grazing function and macroinvertebrate mortality. Macroinvertebrate data were analysed for structural and functional changes in communities and algal data were analysed for changes of biomass both during drought and recovery. Both found rapid recovery post-drought with high incidence of resilience in the macroinvertebrate communities. Functional recovery was determined by investigating grazing rates in dewatering, rewetted and perennial sites. Algal and macroinvertebrate biomass, and grazing function recovered within a month of rewetting. Despite a rapid recovery of overall biomass and grazing function, FFG results showed delayed effects, and four months following drought differences were still present. Mesocosm experiments showed that macroinvertebrate mortality increased due to dewatering for some species, however slower velocity had little effect. Thus, this study showed that ecological function can return despite changes to macroinvertebrate community structure, indicating that functional redundancy promotes the resilience of chalk stream communities to drought...|$|R

The results of artificial methods for hatching of snail eggs indicated that the use of plastic containers, plus either loose topsoil or cotton wool for the incubator mediums or the use of cellophane containers (bag) plus loose topsoil for the incubator medium, were in each case suitable for adoption in successful hatching of snail eggs artificially.
