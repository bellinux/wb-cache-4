5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> the development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> alcoholism, and may be indicated by {{a family history of}} alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E

5|$|Brachytherapy for {{prostate}} cancer may cause erectile dysfunction in approximately 15-30% of patients.
