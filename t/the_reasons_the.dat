5|$|At {{the start}} of the season, Wojtek Wolski was the Avalanche player seen as {{favorite}} to contend for the Calder Memorial Trophy; however, the scoring streak put Stastny into contention as well. Stastny's play was one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> Avalanche experienced their best run of the season towards the end, winning 15 of their last 19games but missing the playoffs by one point. Stastny ended his rookie season with 78points, finished second to Pittsburgh Penguins' Evgeni Malkin in the voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy and was named to the 2006–07 NHL All-Rookie Team.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter pundit John Granger {{additionally}} {{noted that}} one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> Harry Potter books were so popular is their use of literary alchemy (similar to Romeo and Juliet, C. S. Lewis's Perelandra and Charles Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities) and vision symbolism. In this model, authors weave allegorical tales along the alchemical magnum opus. Since the medieval period, alchemical allegory has mirrored the passion, death and resurrection of Christ. While the entire series utilises symbols common in alchemy, the Deathly Hallows completes this cycle, tying themes of death, rebirth, and the Resurrection Stone to the principal motif of alchemical allegory, and topics presented in the first book of the series.|$|E
5|$|Maureen Ryan {{believed}} {{that one of}} <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> episode worked so well was because it left out the storylines with the Night's Watch and the Dothraki and focused in a single location.

5|$|On land, young sea otters {{may face}} attack from bears and coyotes. In California, bites from sharks, {{particularly}} great white sharks, have been estimated to cause 10% of sea otter deaths and {{are one of}} <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> population has not expanded further north. The great white shark {{is believed to be}} their primary predator, and dead sea otters have been found with injuries from shark bites, although {{there is no evidence that}} sharks actually eat them.|$|E
5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> account's {{authenticity}} {{has been}} questioned {{is the fact that}} it claims St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law. Offler doubted that canon law had penetrated to England to any great degree in 1088. The historian Mark Philpott, however, argues that St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law, since he owned a copy of one of the basis of canon law, the False Decretals. The bishop's manuscript of the Decretals still survives.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Operation Ten-Go is revered {{to some degree}} in modern Japan as {{evidenced}} by appearances of the story in popular Japanese culture which usually portray the event as a brave, selfless, but futile, symbolic effort by the participating Japanese sailors to defend their homeland. One of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> event may have such significance in Japanese culture is that the word Yamato was often used as a poetic name for Japan. Thus, the end of battleship Yamato {{could serve as a}} metaphor for the end of the Japanese empire.|$|E

5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, often can be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical constants, from which the value can be calculated. The uncertainty in these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with them, so they do not account for any extra uncertainty {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. One of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> SI unit system will be changed is that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E
5|$|Pre-sejm (Polish: przedsejmowe) sejmiks were convened by {{the king}} who sent a writ (legacja królewska) to each sejmik, {{outlining}} <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> next Sejm would be held. Such sejmiks elected one to six deputies (poslowie), {{depending on the size}} and importance of the sejmik's territory, to the ordinary General Sejm (Polish: Sejm Walny) that was held every two years, and to any extraordinary General Sejm that might be called at any time in an emergency. Sometimes pre-sejm sejmiks were referred to as electoral. In some cases, a sejmik could be called for two voivodeships – in that case it could elect more than 6 deputies. Deputies were given instructions on how to vote during the sejm proper, although on occasion the instructions could be vague, or even give the deputies full freedom. These sejmiks arose in the late 15th century.|$|E
5|$|The Governor didn't {{have the}} right to make or suspend any laws, unless in cases of urgent necessity, he could do it with the consent of the Governor-General of India. He didn't have the power of {{creating}} a new office, or granting any salary, gratuity, or allowance, without the sanction of the Governor-General of India. The Governor-General had full power to superintend and control the Governor in all points relating to the civil or military administration of the Presidency, and the Governor had to obey the orders and instructions of the Governor-General in all cases. The Governors could propose to the Governor-General drafts of any laws which they thought expedient, together with their reasons for the same; and the Governor-General communicated the resolutions to the Governor, after considering <b>the</b> <b>reasons.</b> <b>The</b> Governors regularly transmitted to the Governor-General true copies of all orders and acts of their governments, and also advice of all matters which they felt to be communicated to the Governor-General. The powers of the Governors were not suspended when the Governor-General visited the Presidency. The departure of the Governor from India with intent to return to Europe was deemed to be a resignation from his office. Alternately, the Governor could resign by declaring it in writing and delivering it to the secretary for the public department of the Presidency.|$|E

5|$|The androids {{threaten}} to decapitate Reinette, but the Doctor on Arthur crashes through {{the mirror to}} save her. The androids give up and shut down when the Doctor tells them that they now cannot return to their ship to finish the repairs. Reinette tells the Doctor that she had her fireplace moved to Versailles {{in the hope that}} he would return. The Doctor finds that the fireplace is still an operating time window and uses it to return to the spaceship. He tells Reinette to pack a bag and prepare to leave. The Doctor returns to the fireplace seconds later but discovers that seven years have passed in Reinette's time. King Louis XV finds the Doctor, tells him that Reinette has died and gives him a letter in which Reinette expresses her hopes for the Doctor's quick return and confesses her love for him. The Doctor returns to the TARDIS and watches the time windows close before leaving the ship. The TARDIS crew muse about <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> androids wanted Madame de Pompadour's brain to complete their repairs, and the Doctor conjectures that the ship's memory banks were damaged by the ion storm. When the TARDIS dematerializes, a portrait can be seen stating the birth and death date of Madame de Pompadour. As the episode ends, the lifeless ship drifts through space; its name is SS Madame de Pompadour.|$|E
5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> {{development}} team chose Tokyo as {{the main}} setting was that its turbulent history, going through multiple phases of development and often suffering severe damage in wars or due to natural disasters, made it comparable with the fantasy settings of other games at the time. In a later interview, an Atlus staff member stated that this setting and style made it the antithesis of traditional fantasy RPGs, adding that this resulted in the game developing a punk spirit. Because of the post-apocalyptic setting of Megami Tensei II, the development team wanted to depict a time before the apocalypse. The decision to set the game in Tokyo was made by Suzuki and Kaneko, and was influenced by manga such as Violence Jack, Devilman, and Fist of the North Star. Kichijōji was decided to be the game's starting point due to Kaneko, Suzuki, and Ito all having lived {{in or near the}} area, or having visited it often. The abandoned Terminal Echo building there fascinated them, making them wonder how a building in such a prime location could remain unoccupied; Ito described it as two floors of arcade cabinets, {{with the rest of the}} building feeling like a ghost town. This fascination led to it being included as a dungeon in the game. While designing the maps, Kaneko wanted to use wire-frame models, but the Super Famicom's limited capacities meant this idea was scrapped.|$|E
