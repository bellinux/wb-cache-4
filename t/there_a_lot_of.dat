You've even got a 'Pause for Porno.' It's got everything that a movie needs." [...] Speaking of how he did not record the album for club or radio play and that he planned the album simply for entertainment with comical aspects throughout, he commented [...] "I'm not trying to send out any messages or anything with this record. I just basically do hard-core hip-hop and try to add a touch of dark comedy here and <b>there.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> times the media just takes this and tries to make it into something else when it's all entertainment first. You shouldn't take it too seriously." ...|$|E

2500|$|Peter Debruge of Variety {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, saying [...] "From a creative standpoint, {{this is the}} studio's least exciting feature yet - hardly its worst, execution-wise, but entirely lacking in the risk-taking spirit that has spawned such successful franchises as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and Dragon." [...] Sara Stewart of the New York Post gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "It's refreshing to see a nonwhite lead, and the husky-voiced pop singer is likable as a brave-hearted kid searching for her mother. But man, is <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> Rihanna in this movie: She also provides what seems like {{the entirety of the}} film's soundtrack, making it feel like a vanity project (is 'vanimation' a thing?)." [...] Barbara VanDenburgh of The Arizona Republic gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "For all its energy, razzle-dazzle and whiz-bang technology, it doesn't know how to tell a simple story or cobble together three-dimensional characters, and that's a problem not even the best of 3-D glasses can fix." [...] Susan Wloszczyna of RogerEbert.com gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "I kept thinking about Lilo & Stitch while watching Home, a decidedly disappointing effort based on the popular kid-lit book The True Meaning of Smekday from the already embattled folks at DreamWorks Animation." ...|$|E
