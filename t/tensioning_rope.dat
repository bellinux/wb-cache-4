5000|$|It is {{important}} for safety reasons {{to mention that the}} rope used for the mechanics should be smaller in diameter than the <b>tension</b> <b>rope.</b> This allows for movement but when a large amount of tension is applied to the mechanical rope, friction is created between the two ropes allowing the friction knot to lock on to the <b>tension</b> <b>rope.</b> If two identical ropes of the same diameter are used for the friction knot and <b>tension</b> <b>rope,</b> the knot may move freely like a slip knot (lasso or noose) and not lock into place. When encircling any cylindrical object, most ropes can only be tightened to a diameter slightly greater than the ropes own diameter(USMC Assault Climber Course).|$|R

50|$|Its {{similarity}} with a spinnaker {{is that it}} is not {{attached to}} a stay along its luff, and typically has a slightly larger curvature than a genoa. Luff shape and tension is maintained by the halyard and a bolt rope which is woven into the sail itself, and it is this stiff <b>tensioned</b> <b>rope</b> which allows the sail to be furled on itself. In addition, many screachers are gybed by allowing the sail to fly free and pass in front of the bolt rope and invert, much in the same way that an asymmetrical spinnaker is gybed. Tacking with a screacher may require furling and re-setting. The similarity with a genoa {{is that it is}} typically a white sail, and the clews always overlap the mast.|$|R

6000|$|Suppose {{that the}} man in the chest fixes a rope to the inner side of the lid, and that he {{attaches}} a body to the free end of the rope. The result of this will be to strech the rope so that it will hang [...] " [...] vertically [...] " [...] downwards. If we ask for an opinion of the cause of <b>tension</b> in the <b>rope,</b> {{the man in the}} chest will say: [...] "The suspended body experiences a downward force in the gravitational field, and this is neutralised by the <b>tension</b> of the <b>rope</b> what determines the magnitude of the <b>tension</b> of the <b>rope</b> is the gravitational mass of the suspended body." [...] On the other hand, an observer who is poised freely in space will interpret the condition of things thus : [...] " [...] The rope must perforce take part in the accelerated motion of the chest, and it transmits this motion to the body attached to it. The <b>tension</b> of the <b>rope</b> is just large enough to effect the acceleration of the body. That which determines the magnitude of the <b>tension</b> of the <b>rope</b> is the inertial mass of the body." [...] Guided by this example, we see that our extension of the principle of relativity implies the necessity of the law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass. Thus we have obtained a physical interpretation of this law.|$|R
5000|$|Conga drums are tunable to {{different}} notes. The original drums were tuned by adjusting knots and <b>tension</b> <b>ropes</b> on the drumhead, or, where the drum-heads were tacked or {{nailed to the}} top of the shell, by careful heating of the head. Modern congas use a screw-and-lug tension head system, which makes them easier to tune (or detune). This modern type of tension system is attributed to Carlos [...] "Patato" [...] Valdes, a popular Cuban Conguero. As was discussed above, terminology for the drums varies. Here, the naming system used is a composite of those mentioned before with those currently in use by major conga manufacturers. The drums are discussed in order from largest to smallest; the sizes of the drumheads given vary considerably by manufacturer, model, and style.|$|R

40|$|A {{previous}} study has demonstrated {{the ease with}} which a climber could cut his or her rope using a handsaw (Kane et al. 2009).
