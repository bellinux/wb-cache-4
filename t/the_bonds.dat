50|$|The valence of a bond, S, {{is defined}} as the number of {{electron}} pairs forming <b>the</b> <b>bond.</b> In general this is not an integral number. Since each of the terminal atoms contributes equal numbers of electrons to <b>the</b> <b>bond,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> valence is also equal to the number of valence electrons that each atom contributes. Further, since within each atom, the negatively charged valence shell is linked to the positively charged core by an electrostatic flux that is equal to the charge on the valence shell, it follows that <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> valence is also equal to the electrostatic flux that links the core to the electrons forming <b>the</b> <b>bond.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bond</b> valence is thus equal to three different quantities: the number of electrons each atom contributes to <b>the</b> <b>bond,</b> <b>the</b> number of electron pairs that form <b>the</b> <b>bond,</b> and <b>the</b> electrostatic flux linking each core to <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> electron pair.|$|R

5|$|After nearly 30 {{years of}} {{struggling}} with funding and pursuing various deals, William Beardsley hired engineer Carl Pleasant {{to assist with}} designing. Pleasant recommended hiring the engineer firm Peckham and James to draft plans for the storage dam at the Frogs Tank site. The gravity dam design was dropped, and a relatively new, cheaper and improved but controversial design was adopted: the multiple-arch buttress dam. In 1925, under a new state law, Beardsley was able to create the Beardsley-Agua Fria Water Conservation District. Under the new district, funds could be raised through a bond issue. On December 20, 1925, the construction contract was signed, but <b>the</b> <b>bonds</b> {{had yet to be}} purchased. Five days before the contract was signed, Beardsley died.

Minister of Finance Fleming and Bank of Canada Governor James Coyne proposed that the wartime Victory Bond issue, which constituted two-thirds of the national debt and which was due to be redeemed by 1967, be refinanced to a longer term. After considerable indecision on Diefenbaker's part, a nationwide campaign took place, and 90% of <b>the</b> <b>bonds</b> were converted.
