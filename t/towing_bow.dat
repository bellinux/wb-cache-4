2500|$|On 24 June, four oceangoing tugboats {{arrived at}} the scene and began <b>towing</b> the <b>bow</b> section to safety. However, before any salvage {{operations}} of the stern section could commence, water ingress was reported on 26 June. On the following day, the stern sank at [...] {{to a depth of}} [...] Some of the approximately 1,700 containers on board were later confirmed floating near the site. While no major oil leak was reported, the stern section was said to contain about 1,500 tons of fuel.|$|R
50|$|The next morning, {{the ship}} was again in danger from a large mass of burning oil that was moving across the harbor. The Empress could not steer because of the damaged propeller, but was able to avoid the oil fire {{long enough to get}} {{assistance}} from the tanker Iris. Her captain agreed to <b>tow</b> the <b>bow</b> of Empress of Australia around, and she was then able to move out to sea and a safer anchorage. When taking a count on Sunday, there were over 2000 refugees on board.|$|R
5|$|MV New Carissa was a {{freighter}} {{that ran}} aground {{on a beach}} near Coos Bay, Oregon, United States, during a storm in February 1999 and subsequently broke apart. An attempt to <b>tow</b> the <b>bow</b> section of the ship out to sea failed when the tow line broke, and the bow was grounded again. Eventually, the <b>bow</b> was successfully <b>towed</b> out to sea and sunk. The stern section remained on the beach near Coos Bay. Fuel on board the ship was burned off in situ with napalm, but a significant amount was also spilled from the wreckage, causing ecological damage to the coastline.|$|R
5000|$|Boston Whaler has, {{for many}} years, sawn boats in half to {{illustrate}} their durability, performance, smooth ride and [...] "unsinkability". The original 1961 Life magazine ad pictured Dick Fisher {{sitting in a}} floating 13' Whaler with a crosscut saw halfway through the hull. After the cut was completed, Fisher usehe stern section to <b>tow</b> the <b>bow</b> section back to shore. Modern Whaler advertising uses a chain saw. Due to the foam core construction, the Whaler will remain afloat when sawed completely in half. [...] Boston Whaler boats also remain afloat when completely swamped (full of water). Because of these attributes, Boston Whaler's trademarked sales line is [...] "the unsinkable legend." ...|$|R
2500|$|During July 1918, Abdiel {{underwent}} a much needed refit. On 1 August 1918, Abdiel {{was leading the}} 20th Flotilla {{on its way to}} lay minefield A67 when the flotilla ran into a German minefield, with the destroyers [...] and Ariel striking mines. Ariel sank quickly with the loss of 49 of her crew, but Abdiel took the remains of Vehement in <b>tow.</b> (Vehements <b>bow</b> had been blown off by the explosion, which killed 48 of her crew). The attempt proved unsuccessful, however, with the tow having to be abandoned and Vehement was scuttled. The Flotilla continued its minelaying operations {{until the end of the}} war, with Abdiel laying 6293 mines during the war.|$|R
60|$|Slowly {{the larger}} vessel, {{which was not}} very large, but which drifted faster than our little boat, floated past us, until we were in <b>tow</b> at her <b>bow.</b> We could now see {{the form of a}} man leaning over the rail of the vessel, and he called out to us to know if we were damaged, and if we wanted to come aboard. I was about to reply that we were all right, and would remain where we were, when Walkirk uttered an exclamation.|$|R
5000|$|When fully loaded, {{only the}} curved {{portion of the}} hull {{remained}} above the water, giving the vessel its “whaleback” appearance. Instead of crashing into {{the sides of the}} hull, waves would simply wash over the deck, meeting only the minor resistance of the rounded turrets. When fitted with hawse pipes for anchors and a guide for the <b>tow</b> cable, the <b>bow</b> somewhat resembled the snout of a pig, from which came the alternate and usually derisive appellation of [...] "pig boat". [...] The derision of scoffers notwithstanding, the design performed as McDougall expected. Whether towed or under their own power, they were seaworthy vessels and fast for their time, averaging 15 knots mph.|$|R
50|$|Hale {{returned}} to the Pacific war in early 1945, arriving Pearl Harbor 25 February. Sailing to Ulithi, she departed 14 March with Rear Admiral Forrest Shermans Essex (CV-9) carrier task force to attack enemy air installations prior to the landings on Okinawa. The group suffered casualties, including Franklin (CV-13) and Wasp (CV-18) from air attack 19 - 21 March as Hales gunners shot down several of the attackers. Departing the seas off Japan proper, the carrier force screened by Hale and other destroyers turned to Okinawa, flying close support and bombardment missions before, during, and after the initial assault 1 April. During the harrowing period off Okinawa Hale rescued two fighter pilots, drove off innumerable kamikaze attacks and survived a near miss during a bombing attack. The veteran destroyer departed Okinawa 11 April and after stops at Ulithi and Guam arrived Leyte Gulf in the screen of South Dakota (BB-57) 1 June 1945. She then escorted Washington (BB-56) to Guam and met tug Munsee (AT-107), <b>towing</b> the <b>bow</b> section of cruiser Pittsburgh (CA-72), torn off in the great typhoon off Okinawa, and brought her to Apra Harbor. The ship then sailed to join the 3d Fleet at Leyte Gulf 21 June.|$|R
2500|$|On 2 July, the <b>tow</b> of the <b>bow</b> section {{broke free}} {{in bad weather}} but the towing line was {{reattached}} the next day. On 6 July a fire {{broke out in the}} rear part of the bow section. Unable to get the blaze under control in bad weather the salvage vessels asked for help from an Indian Coast Guard patrol boat with external fire fighting equipment. By 10 July most of the 2,400 containers on board had been destroyed by fire. The damaged bow section sank the next night at [...] to a depth of [...] with what remained of the cargo and 1,600 metric tons of fuel oil in the tanks. No spill apart from a thin oil film on the surface has been reported, but some containers were spotted floating around the sinking site. The cause of the fire remains unknown.|$|R
5|$|After {{additional}} weather-related delays, on February 26 salvors {{managed to}} float the 440foot(132m) bow section {{and began the}} process of towing it out to sea for disposal. By March 1, the tugboat Sea Victory had <b>towed</b> the <b>bow</b> from the beach and out to sea, initially followed by an oil skimmer vessel, OSRV Oregon Responder. However, another severe storm forced the skimmer back to port, and when the tug was 50miles(65km) off the coast, the tow line broke. The bow section floated for fourteen hours until it ran aground near Waldport, Oregon on March 3, approximately 80miles (130km) {{to the north of}} the original grounding site. On March 8, the bow was again refloated, and by March 11 it was successfully towed 280miles(450km) off the coast by Sea Victory and a second tug, Natoma. At this location, the Pacific Ocean is approximately 10,000feet (3,000m) deep. The bow was sunk by two US Navy ships, the destroyer USS David R. Ray and the submarine USS Bremerton. Four hundred pounds (180kg) of high explosives were attached to the bow and detonated. Sixty-nine rounds of gunfire from David R. Rays 5-inch (127mm) deck guns then punctured the hull. After 40 minutes, the ship was still afloat with darkness and a storm approaching. To expedite the sinking, Bremerton fired a Mark 48 torpedo at the underside of the ship. Within ten minutes, the bow section flooded and sank stern-first, trapping the remaining oil within.|$|R

Four crew and two DEMS gunners were killed. Although she had been damaged, Empire Celt continued her voyage.
