5|$|In 1926, Coffin {{fell ill}} {{with a serious}} hip {{infection}} that forced her to curtail much of her physical activity and required a lengthy stay in hospital. She moved to a newly acquired house in New Haven, Connecticut, although she continued to maintain her office in New York and commuted there daily. Coffin often entertained guests in New Haven (and recruited several Connecticut notables as new clients), holding teas, cocktail parties, musical events and buffet suppers. The garden, which she had laid out herself, became the site of garden parties in the summer months. She preferred the company of young architects, artists, musicians and writers, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be curt towards those she took a dislike to; on one occasion, she snubbed Hilaire Belloc when he asked her which of his books she had read.|$|E

25|$|The film's release {{coincided with}} a revival of {{favourable}} public sentiment in respect to the monarchy and a downturn in fortunes for Blair. Michael Sheen reprised his role as Tony Blair from The Deal, and he did so again in The Special Relationship. The Queen also garnered general critical and popular acclaim for Mirren in the title role, which earned her numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actress. Mirren was also praised by the Queen herself and was invited to dinner at Buckingham Palace (<b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not attend due to filming commitments in Hollywood).|$|E

She told the Committee that the US would retain the ability to reinstate sanctions against Iran without unanimous support from the UN Security Council, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> said <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not provide details until a deal was finalized.|$|R
50|$|Veola is {{the owner}} of the magic shop in Kavoc. She is a very taciturn and {{reserved}} girl, bordering on anti-social, but as the game progresses she starts to open up more and becomes good friends with Klein and his crew, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> wishes <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be more than friends with Klein. Because of this, she also develops a not-so-friendly rivalry with Lita over winning Klein over, but they eventually become good friends.|$|R
25|$|In 1616, Samuel More accused {{his wife}} of {{adultery}} and, {{at the direction of}} his father, Richard, devised a plan to rid himself of Katherine and the children. The adultery was supposedly committed with Jacob Blakeway, a young man near in age to Katherine who lived close by and whose family had been More tenants for several generations. In 1608, Jacob Blakeway and his father Edward, a yeoman had renewed a lease on a parcel of land owned by Katherine More's father, Jasper More of Larden Hall. The manor of Larden Hall was about half a mile from Brockton where the Blakeway family lived. By a deed dated 20 April 1616, Samuel cut the entail on the Larden estate to prevent any of the children from inheriting. During the long court battle, Samuel would deny that he was the father of the children borne by his wife, Katherine, and stated them to be children of the adulterous relationship. Katherine did not deny her relationship with Jacob Blakeway, stating there was a former betrothal contract with him, and therefore he was her true husband. This would have made her marriage to Samuel invalid. Samuel quotes her words in his declaration, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not sufficiently prove by witnesses yet it was all one before god as she sayed. At that time any of the usual witnesses would have been dead.|$|E
25|$|Penniman {{must have}} had {{abundant}} opportunity to know Allen’s character. It would seem that she turned against the Toryism of her step-father and her own British ancestry, to sympathize with the settlers in their struggle for freedom and for statehood. But though she doubtless admired Ethan Allen's bravery, {{it is said that}} she was repelled by his rough manners and his tincture of infidelity, and possibly by his family of children, and hesitated for some time before yielding to his wooing. However, after their marriage she had great influence over him <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not entirely cure him of the convivial habits common to the period. This is illustrated by the story of his watch which she insisted must be found every morning hanging on a certain nail as evidence that he had returned home the night before in a condition to make connection between the nail and the ring of his watch. In the spring of 1787, the Allens removed to Burlington, Vermont he having purchased the farm later known as the Van Ness farm north of the city, still later converted into Ethan Allen Park. They spent the first few months in the family of a Mr. Collins at “The Bay,” as the little settlement on the Lake was called, where there were then only three or four families. Here, their younger son Hannibal was born.|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} to London, {{she fell in}} love with John Edward Johnson, who was the captain of an East Indiaman. This was a potentially lucrative career, and they were married at St Pancras Old Church in 1814. <b>Though</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have travelled with him, Jane remained at home. They soon separated, most likely due to abuse by John. Jane later said that she suffered [...] "irreparable injuries" [...] while married to him.|$|E

500|$|Although neither Bernard nor her {{publisher}} was {{enthusiastic about}} her choice, Brodie {{began to work}} on her new project. She resigned her professorship at UCLA in 1977 to devote herself to research, including, for the first time, in oral history collections. [...] Brodie conducted 150 interviews. [...] She tried unsuccessfully to interview Henry Kissinger, whom she knew on a first-name basis—-and Nixon for what she described {{in a letter to}} him as “a compassionate and accurate study.” (Nixon did not reply.) <b>Though</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> find no evidence, Brodie began to think that he had engaged in a homosexual relationship with his good friend Bebe Rebozo. Her psychoanalyst friends tried to warn her off this topic.|$|E
60|$|The second peal {{had been}} louder, and still nobody came. Then {{she walked out}} of the porch, opened the gate, and passed through. And <b>though</b> <b>she</b> looked dubiously at the house-front as if {{inclined}} to return, it was with a breath of relied that she closed the gate. A feeling haunted her that she might have been recognized (<b>though</b> how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not tell), and orders been given not to admit her.|$|R

500|$|One of Victoria's first acts as queen was {{to dismiss}} Conroy {{from her own}} household, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not dismiss him from her mother's. Queen Victoria, as an {{unmarried}} young woman, was still expected {{to live with her}} mother, but she relegated the Duchess and Conroy to remote apartments at Buckingham Palace, cutting off personal contact with them. The Duchess unsuccessfully insisted that Conroy and his family be allowed at court; Victoria disagreed, saying: [...] "I thought you would not expect me to invite Sir John Conroy after his conduct towards me for some years past." [...] In 1839, the Duke of Wellington convinced Conroy to leave the Duchess's household and take his family to the Continent in effective exile. The Times reported that he no longer had official duties, though they were unsure if he had resigned or been dismissed. That year rumours abounded that Lady Flora Hastings, whose abdomen had grown large, was pregnant by Conroy. A subsequent medical investigation concluded that Lady Flora was a virgin and she died from liver cancer several months later. This scandal, in tandem with the Bedchamber Crisis, damaged Victoria's reputation.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{generally}} {{praised the}} clip's simplicity, the visuals, {{and the choice}} of outfits. A reviewer from Rap-Up said, [...] "Kelly Rowland turns her tears into art in the eye-popping video for 'Rose Colored Glasses'..." [...] They focused on the choice of visuals, saying that [...] "the clip shows the Destiny's Child alum struggling with a relationship, while numerous wardrobe changes, vivid colors, doves, and stunning shots of Kelly burst onto the screen." [...] Liz Goodwin of Gather.com agreed with the visuals, saying, [...] "In the music video, Kelly Rowland's body is looking fantastic.

[...] Robbie Daw of Idolator said, [...] "We hope two things happen now that Kelly Rowland’s Rankin-directed 'Rose Colored Glasses' music video has premiered: 1.) you like it and show Miss Kelly some love on iTunes, and 2.) radio programmers in this fine country open their ears and show Miss Kelly major love on the airwaves...Kelly looks truly stunning in this video, from the opening shot of her wearing a dress shirt and tie to the couture dresses she vamps in expertly." ...|$|E

500|$|The storyline {{was created}} in spring 2009 during a story conference, where {{executive}} producer Diederick Santer, storyliner Dominic Treadwell-Collins, series consultant and lead writer Simon Ashdown, series producer Lorraine Newman, script producer Sharon Batten, and Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke were considering what {{to do for the}} Christmas Day 2009 and 25th anniversary episodes. They discussed the character Archie Mitchell and how everyone hated him, and decided on a storyline with characters' hatred and anger towards Archie building up before Christmas, with a peak on Christmas Day when he is killed and another for the reveal on the 19 February 2010 anniversary. They decided to keep the killer's identity a secret within the small group and decided to reveal it during a live episode so that the secret could be kept for as long as possible, and managed the story on a need-to-know basis. The live episode's director, Clive Arnold, became the seventh person to discover the identity of the murderer. They went through the characters to decide who would create a [...] "shiver" [...] moment, and decided against Janine, even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have done it, because she has killed before. The killer was going to be Archie's wife Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), until producers discovered Windsor had planned to leave the show, so they decided on Stacey. Although scripts initially diverted attention away from Stacey, Santer realised that drawing attention away from her too much might make it more apparent.|$|E
500|$|In June 1515, {{she moved}} back to the Medici palace in Florence. [...] Though the Republic of Florence was still a {{republic}} in name, Lorenzo ruled with his mother's help. [...] The Medici palace became the location where government decisions were made. [...] When Lorenzo took the Florentine army in the summer of 1515 to support Pope Leo and the Spanish in the war against Francis I of France, Alfonsina took up the rule in his name. [...] <b>Though</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not hold an official office, she directed the decisions of the governing councils and edited the letters Lorenzo sent to the councils. [...] The councils noted in their records that decisions had been made [...] "by order of Magnificent Lady Alfonsina." [...] She had her chancellor, Bernardo Fiamminghi, appointed as the secretary of the office which created new laws. [...] She also provided orders on who should be 'elected' to the councils throughout the rest of her son's life. [...] She was also involved in the strategy regarding the war. [...] When the Swiss mercenaries left the Spanish army, she began sending treaty proposals to Francis. [...] Pope Leo asked her to provide the ambassadors to negotiate the treaty with Francis. [...] The treaty included a provision allowing the Medici to continue their rule. [...] She had the responsibility of planning the official visit of Pope Leo to Florence in November 1515 as he was traveling to sign the peace treaty.|$|E
500|$|Maria and Anastasia {{were dressed}} {{similarly}} for special occasions, when they wore {{variations of the}} same dress. She tended {{to be dominated by}} her enthusiastic and energetic younger sister. When Anastasia tripped people who walked by, teased others or caused a scene with her dramatics, Maria always tried to apologize, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never stop her younger sister. Maria had simple tastes and was so kind-hearted that she was sometimes taken advantage of by her sisters, who nicknamed her [...] "fat little bow-wow." [...] In 1910, her fourteen-year-old sister Olga persuaded ten-year-old Maria to write their mother a letter asking that Olga be given her own room and be allowed to let down her dresses. Maria tried to persuade her mother that it was her own idea to write the letter. Her mother's friend, Lili Dehn, said that while Maria was not as lively as her three sisters, she knew her own mind. Maria had a talent for drawing and sketched well, always using her left hand, but was generally uninterested in her schoolwork. She was surprisingly strong and sometimes amused herself by demonstrating how she could lift her tutors off the ground. Though usually sweet-natured, Maria could also be stubborn and occasionally lazy. Her mother complained in one letter that Maria was grumpy and [...] "bellowed" [...] at the people who irritated her. Maria's moodiness coincided with her menstrual period, which the Tsarina and her daughters referred to as a visit from [...] "Madame Becker." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{had made}} no answer at the time, but had thought {{afterwards}} {{of what he had}} said. Yes, the two men were very unlike and there was, no doubt, something in what Captain Armstrong had said.

5000|$|Meredith married Sydney engineer, Ainsworth Harrison, on 24 December 1938. He {{proved to}} be [...] "a devoted and {{supportive}} husband" [...] and travelled around Australia with her as she researched her serials. They also travelled overseas several times.

500|$|Rodgers and Hammerstein had disliked Landon's {{novel as}} a basis for a musical when it was published, and their views still held. [...] It {{consists}} of vignettes of life at the Siamese court, interspersed with descriptions of historical events unconnected with each other, except that the King creates most of the difficulties in the episodes, and Anna tries to resolve them. Rodgers and Hammerstein could see no coherent story from which a musical could be made until they saw the 1946 film adaptation, starring Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, and how the screenplay united the episodes in the novel. [...] Rodgers and Hammerstein were also concerned about writing a star vehicle. [...] They had preferred to make stars rather than hire them, and engaging the legendary Gertrude Lawrence would be expensive. [...] Lawrence's voice was also a worry: her limited vocal range was diminishing with the years, while her tendency to sing flat was increasing. [...] Lawrence's temperament was another concern: <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not sing like one, the star was known to be capable of diva-like behavior. [...] In spite of this, they admired her acting – what Hammerstein called her [...] "magic light", [...] a compelling presence on stage – and agreed to write the show. [...] For her part, Lawrence committed to remaining in the show until June 1, 1953, and waived the star's usual veto rights over cast and director, leaving control {{in the hands of the}} two authors.|$|E
500|$|Measure for Measure has {{frequently}} {{been considered a}} [...] "problem play". It was a problem for Hazlitt in that it contains almost no character with whom one can feel complete sympathy. [...] "here is in general a want of passion; the affections are at a stand; our sympathies are reflected and defeated in all directions." [...] Angelo, the Deputy ruler of Vienna, is forgiven by the Duke but draws only Hazlitt's hatred, as [...] "he {{seems to have a}} much greater passion for hypocrisy than for his mistress." [...] "Neither are we enamoured of Isabella's rigid chastity, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not act otherwise than she did." [...] Isabella's brother Claudio [...] "is the only person who feels naturally", yet even he does not show well in his pleading for life at the sacrifice of his sister's virginity. There is no easy solution for his plight, and [...] "he is placed in circumstances of distress which almost preclude the wish for his deliverance." [...] Over a century later, commentator R.W. Chambers placed Hazlitt as the first of a long line of notable Shakespearean critics who felt the same way, and he quoted Characters of Shakespear's Plays in establishing his contention (as a basis for arguing his own different view of the play) that Hazlitt was among the first of dozens of distinguished critics who could not comprehend how Mariana could love and plead for someone like Angelo, and in general showed a distaste for much in Measure for Measure.|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, Yellow Robe married Lillian (Lillie) Belle Springer, of Swiss-German ancestry, from Tacoma, Washington. [...] Lillie was a {{volunteer}} nurse at the Rapid City Indian School. Chauncey and Lillian had three daughters, Rosebud, Chauncina and Evelyn. Chauncey chose {{to send his}} daughters to the Rapid City public schools instead of the Indian School because the public schools had academic orientation, while the Indian School focused on vocational courses in agriculture, blacksmithing and domestic arts. On occasion, elderly Indians would visit {{the grounds of the}} Indian School and tell stories in the Lakota language. Chauncey would have Rosebud listen, even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not understand a word, and later he would retell the stories in English.
