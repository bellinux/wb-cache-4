5|$|A <b>theodolite</b> can be {{considerably}} more accurate if used correctly, {{but it is}} also considerably more difficult to use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a <b>theodolite</b> with North and so the scale has to be calibrated using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun. Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes can be measured with a <b>theodolite</b> or a clinometer.|$|E

5|$|An {{alignment}} {{is calculated}} {{by measuring the}} azimuth, the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually measured using a <b>theodolite</b> or a compass. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination {{must be taken into}} account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E
5|$|All trucks of the LRDG were {{equipped}} with the Bagnold sun compass and some trucks were also {{equipped with}} a P8 Tank Compass. Each patrol had a navigator who always rode in the second truck in the formation. He was equipped with a <b>theodolite</b> and astronomical position tables with which to plot star sightings, and maps. Watches were used and adjusted each evening using the GMT time check. One major problem faced early on by the LRDG {{was a lack of}} accurate maps for Libya in particular. Patrols had to do their own surveys and make their own maps of each route they took. In July 1941 the Survey Section was formed to carry out this task.|$|E
5|$|Stanley {{produced}} a 'Panoptic Stereoscope' in 1855, which was financially successful. Stereoscopes had sold for five shillings each– Stanley discovered a simpler method to make them, which {{enable him to}} sell them for one shilling. He {{was able to take}} an additional shops at 3–4 Great Turnstile and 286 High Holborn, as well as a skilled assistant. He did not patent the Panoptic, so it was soon copied around the world, but he had sold enough to provide the capital required to manufacture scientific instruments. In 1861 he invented a straight line dividing machine for which he won first prize in the 1862 International Exhibition in London. Stanley brought out the first catalogue of his products in 1864. By the fifth edition, Stanley was able to list important customers such as several government departments, the Army, the Royal Navy, railways at home and abroad, and London University. From 1865, he worked on improving the elegance and stability of surveying instruments, especially the <b>theodolite,</b> whose construction he simplified. It had a rotating telescope for measuring horizontal and vertical angles and able to take sights on prominent objects at a distance. The component parts were reduced to fewer than half of the 226 used in the previous version, making it lighter, cheaper and more accurate.|$|E

25|$|As {{suggested}} by the etymology of the word, {{one of the earliest}} reasons for interest in geometry was surveying, and certain practical results from Euclidean geometry, such as the right-angle property of the 3-4-5 triangle, were used long before they were proved formally. The fundamental types of measurements in Euclidean geometry are distances and angles, and both of these quantities can be measured directly by a surveyor. Historically, distances were often measured by chains such as Gunter's chain, and angles using graduated circles and, later, the <b>theodolite.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{our days}} precise {{geodetic}} instruments are very {{widely used in}} geodesy, building structures, surveying, machine engineering etc. Many of those instruments are based on precise measurement of the directions differences (ie measurement of angles). Such instruments are: <b>theodolites,</b> digital <b>theodolites,</b> total stations etc. Testing and calibration of these instruments is quite complicated task, although it is evidently needed. In this paper we present the creation and preliminary research of accuracy of the test bench designed to perform the testing and calibration of such geodetic instruments...|$|R

25|$|Amundsen used {{prepared}} navigation sheets that simplified {{the calculations}} {{for his team}} when they were tired and cold. Four out of his team of five were qualified navigators. Amundsen's expedition also used a sextant during the journey, which is a relatively light and simple piece of equipment. He also attended a symposium that reviewed how to fix position at high latitudes. Scott used a <b>theodolite</b> which is heavier and requires more mental arithmetic. Scott also lacked navigators having only one per team. Scott dismissed Cherry-Garrard's request for navigational training and Wilson only attempted {{to learn how to}} read latitudes at the last moment.|$|E
25|$|Copying {{the work}} methods of Cook's {{scientists}}, the scientists on this voyage would base their calculations of longitude on precision watches {{and the distance}} between the moon and the sun followed by <b>theodolite</b> triangulations or bearings taken from the ship, the same as those taken by Cook to produce his maps of the Pacific islands. As regards geography, Lapérouse decisively showed the rigour and safety of the methods proven by Cook. From his voyage, the resolution of the problem of longitude was evident and mapping attained a scientific precision. Impeded (as Cook had been) by the continual mists enveloping the northwestern coast of America, he did not succeed any better in producing complete maps, though he managed to fill in some of the gaps.|$|E
25|$|Scafell Pike {{was used}} in 1826 as a station in the Principal Triangulation of Britain by the Ordnance Survey when they fixed the {{relative}} positions of Britain and Ireland. Angles between Slieve Donard in Northern Ireland and Scafell Pike were taken from Snowdon in North Wales as were angles between Snowdon and Scafell Pike from Slieve Donard. Given the need for clear weather to achieve these very long-range observations (111 miles to Slieve Donard), the Ordnance surveyors {{spent much of the}} summer camped on the respective mountain tops. Strangely, Scafell Pike was not used as a station in the earlier part of the Principal Triangulation of Britain, even though Sca-Fell formed one corner of a Principal Triangle. The Ordnance Survey's high precision <b>theodolite</b> was not taken to the summit until 1841.|$|E

25|$|First, {{stakes were}} {{driven into the}} ground to roughly mark out the {{positions}} for the cast iron columns; these points were then set precisely by <b>theodolite</b> measurements. Then the concrete foundations were poured, and the base plates for the columns were set into them. Once the foundations were in place, the erection of the modules proceeded rapidly. Connector brackets were attached {{to the top of}} each column before erection, and these were then hoisted into position. Since the project took place before the development of powered cranes, the raising of the columns was done manually using shears (or shear legs), a simple crane mechanism. These consisted of two strong poles, which were set several metres apart at the base and then lashed together at the top to form a triangle; this was stabilized and kept vertical by guy ropes fixed to the apex, stretched taut and tied to stakes driven into the ground some distance away. Using pulleys and ropes hung from the apex of the shear, the navvies hoisted the columns, girders and other parts into place.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a diverse}} range and {{combination}} of methodologies employed {{to understand the}} hydrological dynamics in salt marshes {{and their ability to}} trap and accrete sediment. Sediment traps are often used to measure rates of marsh surface accretion when short term deployments (e.g. less than one month) are required. These circular traps consist of pre-weighed filters that are anchored to the marsh surface, then dried in a laboratory and re-weighed to determine the total deposited sediment. For longer term studies (e.g. more than one year) researchers may prefer to measure sediment accretion with marker horizon plots. Marker horizons consist of a mineral such as feldspar that is buried at a known depth within wetland substrates to record the increase in overlying substrate over long time periods. In order to gauge the amount of sediment suspended in the water column, manual or automated samples of tidal water can be poured through pre-weighed filters in a laboratory then dried to determine the amount of sediment per volume of water. Another method for estimating suspended sediment concentrations is by measuring the turbidity of the water using optical backscatter probes, which can be calibrated against water samples containing a known suspended sediment concentration to establish a regression relationship between the two. Marsh surface elevations may be measured with a stadia rod and transit, electronic <b>theodolite,</b> Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System, laser level or electronic distance meter (total station). Hydrological dynamics include water depth, measured automatically with a pressure transducer, or with a marked wooden stake, and water velocity, often using electromagnetic current meters.|$|E

500|$|Mason however {{declined}} {{to conduct the}} work himself for the offered commission of one guinea per day. The task therefore fell to Maskelyne, {{for which he was}} granted a temporary leave of his duties as Astronomer Royal. He was aided in the task by mathematician and surveyor Charles Hutton and Reuben Burrow, a mathematician of the Royal Greenwich Observatory. A workforce of labourers was engaged to construct observatories for the astronomers, and assist in the surveying. The science team was particularly well-equipped: its astronomical instruments included a [...] brass quadrant from Cook's 1769 transit of Venus expedition, a [...] zenith sector, and a regulator (precision pendulum clock) for timing the astronomical observations. They also acquired a <b>theodolite</b> and Gunter's chain for surveying the mountain, and a pair of barometers for measuring altitude. Generous funding for the experiment was available due to underspend on the transit of Venus expedition, which had been turned over to the Society by the King.|$|E
500|$|The pair {{initially}} traveled mainly over flat snowfields. Nansen {{had allowed}} 50days {{to cover the}} [...] to the pole, requiring an average daily journey of seven nautical miles (13km; 8.1mi). On 22 March a sextant observation showed that the pair had travelled [...] towards the pole at a daily average of over nine nautical miles (17km; 10mi). This had been achieved despite very low temperatures, typically around , and small scale mishaps including {{the loss of the}} sledgemeter that recorded mileage. However, as the surfaces became uneven and made skiing more difficult, their speeds slowed. A sextant reading on 29 March of 85°56′N indicated that a week's travel had brought them [...] nearer to the pole, but also showed that their average daily distances were falling. More worryingly, a <b>theodolite</b> reading that day suggested that they were at only 85°15′N, and they had no means of knowing which of the readings was correct. They realised that they were fighting a southerly drift, and that distances travelled did not necessarily equate to northerly progression. Johansen's diary indicated his failing spirits: [...] "My fingers are all destroyed. All mittens are frozen stiff ... It is becoming worse and worse ... God knows what will happen to us".|$|E
2500|$|Rocque {{combined}} two surveying techniques: {{he made a}} ground-level survey with {{a compass}} and a physical metal chain [...] the unit of length also being the chain.

He also created a triangulation network over the entire area to be covered by taking readings from church towers and similar high places using a <b>theodolite</b> made by Jonathan Sisson (inventor of the telescopic-sighted <b>theodolite)</b> to measure the observed angle between two other prominent locations. The process was repeated from point to point.|$|E
