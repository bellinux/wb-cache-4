Elliott Smith included [...] "Long, Long, Long" [...] in his live performances.

During Jayden's audition, Liz realizes that Jayden's supposed references—Gilbert Godfried, Martin Scorsese, and Christopher Walken—were not legit and that Jayden impersonated them. She confronts him about this, however, Jayden plans to blackmail Liz with a camera marked by her fingerprints—that features provocative photos of Jayden, {{to make it look like}} Liz would only hire him if he would let her take pictures of his genitals. Liz tries to stop Jack from casting Jayden, though Jack has made up his mind in hiring the robot street performer. Jack casts him after he shook his hand without being concerned that Jack had bedbugs.|$|E

500|$|Eberhardt {{made friends}} {{in the area and}} met an Algerian soldier, Slimane Ehnni. They fell in love, and {{eventually}} lived together openly. This alienated Eberhardt from the French authorities, who were already outraged by her lifestyle. During her travels she made contact with the Qadiriyya, a Sufi order. The order was led by Hussein benBrahim, who was so impressed with Eberhardt's knowledge of (and passion for) Islam that he initiated her into his zawiya without the usual formal examination. This convinced the French authorities that she was a spy or an agitator, and they placed her on a widely-circulated blacklist. The French transferred Ehnni to the spahi regiment at Batna, possibly to punish Eberhardt (whom they could not harm directly). Too poor to accompany him to Batna, Eberhardt traveled to a Qadiriyya meeting in Behima in late January 1901 where she hoped to ask SiLachmi, a marabout, for financial assistance. While waiting for the meeting to begin she was attacked by a man with a sabre, receiving a superficial wound to her head and a deep cut to her left arm. Her attacker, Abdallah ben Mohammed, was overpowered by others and arrested. When asked why he had tried to kill Eberhardt he only repeated [...] "God wished it; God still wishes it." [...] Eberhardt suspected that he was an assassin hired by the French authorities. Others attribute the attack to SiLachmi; Eberhardt was his mistress, whom he had grown tired of, and it is speculated he was simultaneously <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of her and pin the blame for the attack on a rival tribe. She was brought to the military hospital at ElOued the following day. After Eberhardt recovered in late February, she joined Ehnni with funds from members of the Qadiriyya who regarded her survival as a miracle.|$|E

He bought an old tweed jacket that Gauci had been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of for years, a blue Babygro, a woollen cardigan, {{and a number of other}} items, all different styles and sizes.

2500|$|The {{main goal}} of ACT is to {{increase}} psychological flexibility. [...] There are six core processes in ACT interventions: Acceptance, Cognitive Defusion, Self as Context, Being Present, Values, and Committed Action. [...] Acceptance is taught in order to teach people to embrace their emotions, rather than <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of them. [...] An example of acceptance would be when people feel angry and then choose {{to focus on the}} anger and accept that they are angry, rather than trying to unleash their anger to get rid of it. [...] Cognitive defusion teaches people to not take their thoughts as literal in order to decrease the believability of negative thoughts and increase flexibility to behave as they want. [...] An example of cognitive defusion would be when someone thinks “I am the worst,” and then defuses the thought by thinking of things in which he or she excels.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} is Vin Scully's call of Kirk Gibson's game inning {{home run in}} Game 1 of the 1988 World Series of the 1988 World Series: [...] "All year long, they looked to him to light the fire, [...] and all year long, he answered the demands, until he was physically unable to start tonight – with two bad legs: The bad left hamstring, and the swollen right knee. And, with two out, {{you talk about a}} roll of the dice... this is it." [...] Scully made repeated references to Gibson's legs, noting at one point that the batter was [...] "shaking his left leg, making it quiver, like a horse <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of a troublesome fly." [...] Gibson worked the count to 3–2 as Mike Davis stole second base; the camera turned at that point to Steve Sax getting ready for his turn at the plate, and Scully reminded the viewers that Sax was waiting on deck, but that the game right now is at the plate. [...] "High fly ball into right field, she i-i-i-is... gone!!" [...] Scully said nothing for over a minute, allowing the pictures to tell the story. Finally, he said, [...] "In a year that has been so improbable... the impossible has happened!" [...] Returning to the subject of Gibson's banged-up legs during a replay, Scully joked, [...] "And, now, the only question was, could he make it around the base paths unassisted?!" [...] "You know, I said it once before, a few days ago, that Kirk Gibson was not the Most Valuable Player; that the Most Valuable Player for the Dodgers was Tinkerbell. But, tonight, I think Tinkerbell backed off for Kirk Gibson. And, look at Eckersley – shocked to his toes!" [...] "They are going wild at Dodger Stadium – no one wants to leave!" [...] As NBC showed a replay of Gibson rounding second base in his home run trot, Scully then made a point to note Eckersley's pitching performance throughout the 1988 season, to put things in perspective. [...] "Dennis Eckersley allowed five home runs all year. And we'll be back." ...|$|E

2500|$|To deploy tanks, it {{was first}} needed to train crews and create tank units. On 14 July 1916 Estienne started {{to set up a}} {{training}} base at the Fort du Trou-d'Enfer, a fortress at Marly-le-Roi, west of Paris. For reasons of secrecy this location was officially attached to the 81st Heavy Artillery Regiment, a depot unit. On 15 August the camp was formally established and quickly filled with recruits, most of them young volunteers from various French armies. [...] At Marly the crews received their first instruction consisting of the basics of maintenance and a lot of driver training with an emphasis on crossing trenches, avoiding shell craters and running down trees and walls. Because no actual Schneider vehicles were available at first, Holt tractors were used instead; later boiler plate training chassis were employed with the superstructure removed and replaced by a protective wooden frame. From the spring of 1917 onwards about seven vehicles were used for this goal. For unit training and live fire exercises, which required much larger manoeuvre grounds, on 30 August 1916 a camp was established at Cercottes. It received its first training vehicles on 17 November 1916. To get better acquainted with the mechanical side of the tanks, most crew members left Cercottes for a month to work as a trainee at the SOMUA factory. New vehicles would normally be first delivered at Cercottes. In 1917 the Cercottes base grew to a strength of about five thousand men, many of them sent there from units <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of undesirable elements, forcing the base command to reduce manpower by again removing them. On 28 September 1916 a large instruction centre was established at Champlieu, south of Compiègne. [...] This location, close to the frontline and officially part of the warzone, could serve for final training and sending out battle-ready units to those armies needing them. [...] The tank workshops were also located there, repairing and updating existing vehicles. The bases at Cercottes and Champlieu used about sixty-four tanks purely for training purposes, to limit the wear on the combat vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|Although Abi {{discovers the}} truth, she {{decides not to}} tell Lauren after Steven tells her he is {{planning}} to leave Lauren to be with her. However, Steven tells Lauren he wants to adopt Louie and stuns Abi by proposing marriage to Lauren in The Queen Vic. When Lauren leaves Walford to visit Tanya, conflicted on her relationship with Steven, Max tells him he knows he lied about the brain tumour and gives him an ultimatum: help him move some clients from his property or he will tell Lauren the truth. Max tells Steven to {{set fire to the}} flat while making sure the clients safely exit the premises. Steven refuses and tells Max that he will tell Lauren the truth when she returns and tells Abi that their affair was a mistake. However, when Lauren texts to say that she will be staying with Tanya for longer, Steven agrees to Max's plan. However, the plan appears to backfire when the residents hear sirens of fire engines, police cars and ambulances. Max finds Steven in The Vic alleyway and Steven tells him he does not know if the clients exited the flat. Max tells Steven that he is on his own as he drove Ian's car to the flat, while dismissing Steven's claim that if he goes to prison, Max will go down too. Max tells him to find an alibi, so Steven asks Abi. Steven tells Max that he has an alibi and mentions that the clients did exit the flat. Jane later discovers Max's revenge plan and Steven's brain tumour lie and Max convinces Steven that Jane is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of him. Steven confronts Jane and blames her for Max's behaviour, but Jane tries to reason with Steven and reveals Abi is pregnant. However, Steven refuses to believe her, and after taunting her about Lucy's murder, sets fire to the restaurant, and leaves Jane to perish in the flames. Believing Lauren trapped inside, Steven and Max run back into the inferno and Steven saves Abi, who became trapped upon finding, and attempting to save Jane. Max tried to get Steven to kill Jane but he refuses and tries to save her. Max violently pushes him into a countertop, causing Steven to be rushed to hospital where he tells Abi that he loves her and will try to make their relationship work. He then suffers a [...] cardiac arrest and dies from his injuries. When Steven's lies are revealed, it is also revealed that Steven died of injuries to the liver (likely from when Max pushed him) and so only Abi attends his funeral and reads a eulogy dedicated to him.|$|E
