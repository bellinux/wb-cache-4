Solid dosage forms are coated {{for a number of}} reasons, the most important of which is controlling the release profiles. The amount of coating on the surface of a tablet is critical to the effectiveness of the oral dosage form. Tablets are usually coated in horizontal rotating pans with the coating solution sprayed onto the free surface of the tablet bed. The advantages of <b>tablet</b> <b>coating</b> are taste masking, odour masking, physical and chemical protection, protects the drug from the gastric environment etc. There are various techniques for <b>tablet</b> <b>coating</b> such as sugar coating, film coating, and enteric coating. Recent trends in pharmaceutical technologies are the development of coating methods which overcomes the various disadvantages associated with solvent based coatings. In these latest technologies coating materials are directly coated onto the surface of solid dosage forms without using any solvent. Various solventless coatings are available such as electrostatic dry coating, magnetically assisted impaction coating, compression coating, hot melt coating, powder coating, and supercritical fluid coating. Supercell Coating Technology is a revolutionary <b>tablet</b> <b>coating</b> that accurately deposits controlled amounts of coating materials on tablets even if they are extremely hygroscopic or friable.

40|$|Process {{control of}} aqueous <b>tablet</b> <b>coating</b> {{depends on a}} number of {{thermodynamic}} and psychrometric variables.

Several mass or heat conservation models for aqueous <b>tablet</b> <b>coating</b> {{can be found in the}} literature, varying in approach and proposed method for controlling the coating process. A commonly used first-principles model built upon the coupled heat and mass transfer in evaporative mass transfer derives an “Environmental Equivalency” (EE) factor as an indicator of the relative rate of water evaporation from the tablet bed surface and as a relevant scaling factor for aqueous coating. The EE factor is expressed by an equation involving ten individual parameters; however, if the derivation of EE is extended further under the context of an adiabatic process, a much-simplified yet equivalent expression for EE emerges consisting of only three parameters, each directly measurable or obtainable from a psychrometric chart and which bear direct significance to the gross thermodynamic conditions of the coating.

Methods: In a phase 0 clinical study, PK profiles of several oral candidate ER formulations of capecitabine {{were compared to}} the PK profile of capecitabine after administration of the commercially available immediate-release (IR) tablet. A single dose of 1000  mg IR formulation (two 500  mg tablets) was administered on day 1, and a single dose of a 1000  mg candidate ER formulation of capecitabine (two 500  mg tablets) was administered on day 2.

40|$|Abstract. A {{combination}} of analytical and statistical methods {{is used to}} improve a <b>tablet</b> <b>coating</b> process guided by quality by design (QbD) principles. A solid dosage form product was found to intermittently exhibit bad taste. A suspected cause was the variability in coating thickness {{which could lead to}} the subject tasting the active ingredient in some tablets. A number of samples were analyzed using a laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) -based analytical method, and {{it was found that the}} main variability component was the tablet-to-tablet variability within a lot. Hence, it was inferred that the coating process (performed in a perforated rotating pan) required optimization. A set of designed experiments along with response surface modeling and kriging method were used to arrive at an optimal set of operating conditions. Effects of the amount of coating imparted, spray rate, pan rotation speed, and spray temperature were characterized. The results were quantified in terms of the relative standard deviation of tablet-averaged LIBS score and a coating variability index which was the ratio of the standard deviation of the tablet-averaged LIBS score and the weight gain of the tablets. The data-driven models developed based on the designed experiments predicted that the minimum value of this index would be obtained for a 6 % weight gain for a pan operating at the highest speed at the maximum fill level while using the lowest spraying rate and temperature from the chosen parametric space. This systematic application of the QbD-based method resulted in an enhanced process understanding and reducing the coating variability by more than half.
