30|$|Classification is {{a process}} in which a single group of {{entities}} are ordered into a number of smaller groups on the basis of observable properties. In health and health-related domains, this basis for classification is impairment in body structure and function [1, 2]. In paralympic sports, classification of impairment in athletes is vital to minimise the impact of impairment on the outcome of competition. Without classification, paralympic sport competition could potentially have a one-sided and predictable outcome, in which athletes with the least impairment would have the best chance to win. Classification systems have been developed and applied since the founding of the paralympic movement [3]. All paralympic classification systems evolved from a medical assessment model, developed based on expert opinion by classifiers. Typically, these individuals are volunteers with medical or health-related professional training and/or sport-specific expertise. In 2007, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) published the IPC Classification Code and International Standards to provide a structure for classification principles for all paralympic sports [4]. The IPC Classification Code states that classification in the paralympic movement should be based on eligible impairment types per sport and the effect of these impairments on sport-specific activity, irrespective of the health condition causing the impairment. An important purpose of <b>the</b> <b>Classification</b> <b>Code</b> is to charge international sports federations with the development of evidence-based classification systems through research. An evidence-based classification system is a requirement for each sport federation to maintain compliance with the code and, consequently, preserve membership in the paralympic movement. The IPC position stand, published in 2009, defined evidence-based classification and provided guidelines on how an evidence-based classification system may be achieved [2].|$|E
40|$|Due {{to recent}} {{advances}} in technology, the recording and analysis of video data has become an increasingly common component of athlete training programmes. Today it is incredibly easy and affordable {{to set up a}} fixed camera and record athletes {{in a wide range of}} sports, such as diving, gymnastics, golf, tennis, etc. However, the manual analysis of the obtained footage is a time-consuming task which involves isolating actions of interest and categorizing them using domain-specific knowledge. In order to automate this kind of task, three challenging sub-problems are often encountered: 1) temporally cropping events/actions of interest from continuous video; 2) tracking the object of interest; and 3) classifying the events/actions of interest. Most previous work has focused on solving just one of the above sub-problems in isolation. In contrast, this paper provides a complete solution to the overall action monitoring task in the context of a challenging real-world exemplar. Specifically, we address the problem of diving classification. This is a challenging problem since the person (diver) of interest typically occupies fewer than 1 % of the pixels in each frame. The model is required to learn the temporal boundaries of a dive, even though other divers and bystanders may be in view. Finally, the model must be sensitive to subtle changes in body pose over a large number of frames to determine <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> <b>code.</b> We provide effective solutions to each of the sub-problems which combine to provide a highly functional solution to the task as a whole. The techniques proposed can be easily generalized to video footage recorded from other sports. Comment: To appear at CVsports 201...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The Fracture and Dislocation Registry of Stavanger University Hospital were {{initiated}} 1 st of January 2004 {{to accomplish the}} request of reliable data regarding incidence, modes of treatment and outcome of fractures. To ensure good quality in the registry the data have been consecutively controlled. To prepare the registry for further research the most important parameter, <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> <b>code</b> was validated. Method: All inpatient primary and secondary treatments of fractures made at the operation theatre were classified and reported by the surgeons consecutively. The most important parameters were; the AO/OTA- and Gustilo/Anderson-classification, the method of fixation, {{and the reasons for}} the reoperations. The surgeons recoded the fractures during the intra- and inter-rater analyses. A reference code dataset was made for accuracy assessment. Results: All involved surgeons reported to the registry. Completeness has been excellent. Approximately 28 % of the long bone fractures that was diagnosed inhospitally or at the Emergency Department were treated in the operation theatre. The overall incidence per 100, 000 per year was 406 with a 95 % confidence interval (95 %CI) of 395 – 417. The male:female ratio was 2 : 1 among those < 50 years, and 1 : 3 in those ≥ 50 years. The accuracy of (four sign of) the AO/OTA classification was for adult fractures; kappa agreement of 0. 68 (95 % CI: 0. 65 – 0. 71) and for children’s fractures Κ= 0. 72 (95 % CI: 0. 64 - 0. 79) and PA 76 %. Fracture type, frequency of the fracture, and segment fractured significantly influenced accuracy, whereas the coder’s experience did not. Conclusion: The implementation of the Fracture and Dislocation Registry has been made successfully. Maintenance of the registry is assured by the controller through the features of the electronic database program. The classification according to AO/OTA classification (= Müller classification) seems to be satisfactory reliable. The registry seems to be well prepared for contribution to quality assurance and improvements in fracture treatment. </p...|$|E
40|$|Supernovae are cosmic {{explosions of}} cataclysmic {{proportion}} that signify {{the death of}} a star. While being interesting phenomena in their own right, their brightness also make them excellent probes of the early universe. Depending on the type of the progenitor star and the origin of the explosion different subjects can be investigated. In this dissertation the work I have done on the detection, characterisation and rate measurements of supernovae in the Stockholm VIMOS Supernova Search is presented. We have discovered 16 supernovae that exploded billions of years ago (or, equivalently, at high redshift, z). The observed brightness and colour evolution have been used to classify the supernovae into either thermonuclear (type Ia) or core collapse (type II) supernovae. The accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> <b>code</b> is high, only about 5 % of the supernovae are mistyped, similar to other codes of the same kind. By comparing the observed frequency of supernovae to simulations the underlying supernova rate at these high redshifts have been measured. The main result reported in this thesis is that the core collapse supernova rate at high redshift matches the rates estimated from looking at the star formation history of the universe, and agree well with previous studies. The rate of Ia supernovae at high redshift have been investigated by several projects, our results show a somewhat higher rate of Ia supernovae than expected. Proper estimates of the systematic errors of rate measurements are found to be very important. Furthermore, by using novel techniques for reducing and stacking images, we have obtained a galaxy sample containing approximately 50, 000 galaxies. Photometric redshifts have been obtained for most of the galaxies, the resulting accuracy below z= 1 is on the order of 10 %. The galaxy sample has also been used to find high redshift sources, so called Lyman Break Galaxies, at z= 3 - 5.

This entailed a number of more practical underlying factors regarding the design of the tree structure, what kind of language is used and {{how easy it is to}} understand, whether or not there are special categories for LGBT-related literature and whether or not there are direct links between literature with LGBT content. The systems investigated were the online book shops Amazon (both the American version and the British subsidiary), The Book Depository and Adlibris along with the classification systems used by the national libraries in the countries where these book shops reside (the US, the UK and Sweden) : Library of Congress Classification (LC), Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and Klassifikationssystem för svenska bibliotek (SAB). Two of the library systems (LC and DDC) did not have a tree structure available for the customers to see and navigate through, while the third one (SAB) offered a structure with both <b>the</b> <b>classification</b> <b>code</b> and Swedish words explaining what the codes meant, even if the categories and subdivisions were not optimally constructed. None of them had very many links to other literature. Two of them (The Book Depository and Adlibris) did not have main categories specifically for LGBT content which both Amazon US and Amazon UK did. All the library systems could use a revision to ensure that literature, and particularly LGBT literature as that was the focal point of {{this investigation}}, is easily available. The Library of Congress and the British Library need to establish a tree structure their clients could use and all three need to make sure they have a category where LGBT literature is collected and available at the root. The online book shops on the other hand do not need to do much to improve the availability of their systems: like the library systems, Adlibris and The Book Shop need to create a category of LGBT literature in the tree structure but besides that the private companies pass with credit. The systems used by the Amazon branches proved to have the greatest availability of all the systems investigated...|$|E
