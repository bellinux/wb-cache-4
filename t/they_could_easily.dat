5|$|Bates leaves Obydos; {{he finds}} the people lazy, as {{otherwise}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> become comfortable with mixed farming. They sail through a tremendous storm. He finds a Pterochroza grasshopper whose forewings perfectly resemble leaves, the Victoria waterlily, masses of ticks, the howler monkey and large Morpho butterflies. He meets Wallace again at Barra. Back in Para, he catches yellow fever.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{population}} size would not dramatically increase until the Song dynasty period, when the population doubled to 100 million {{people because of}} extensive rice cultivation in central and southern China, coupled with rural farmers holding more abundant yields of food that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> provide to the growing market.|$|E
5|$|The {{control of}} Vijithapura was {{essential}} to both sides. The loss of the stronghold would be a largely demoralizing factor for Elara's forces and would significantly reduce their capability to resist Duthhagamani's advance. For Dutthagamani's forces, the capture of the city would mean that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> move on to Anuradhapura.|$|E

50|$|In December 2016, during Italy's {{constitutional}} referendum, Pelù {{doubted the}} lawfulness of the pencils, since <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be <b>easily</b> deleted {{on a piece}} of normal paper, while <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be deleted from the paper used to vote.|$|R
5|$|A local report {{suggested}} that this bridge was used by George Washington {{and two of his}} aides while still under construction and the timbers had yet to be secured, with Bull helping their horses across. The bridge also served as a point of refuge, particularly for Connecticut's Blue Law offenders, where once on the left bank of the river, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> cross to the New York border. State authorities would not go through the extradition process, leaving them safe.|$|E
5|$|Smetona and Voldemaras, both {{representing}} the Lithuanian National Union, invited the Christian Democrats {{to join them}} in forming a new government that would restore some degree of constitutional legitimacy. The party agreed reluctantly; {{they were worried about}} their prestige. Looking toward the near future, the Christian Democrats reasoned that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> win any upcoming Seimas elections, regaining power by constitutional means and avoiding direct association with the coup. In keeping with this strategy, they allowed members of the Lithuanian National Union to take over the most prominent posts.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 Summer Paralympics used many of {{the same}} venues as the 2012 Summer Olympics, along with two new {{locations}} such as Eton Manor for wheelchair tennis and Brands Hatch for road cycling. London's purpose-built Olympic venues and facilities, including the Olympic Village itself, were designed to be accessible as possible so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> accommodate the Paralympics. Some venues also contained additional accessible seating areas during the Paralympics.|$|E

50|$|Domville Station was an {{agricultural}} community, as most {{residents in the}} 1800s sustained themselves through family farming operations. Until World War I, hops were the main commodity as <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be <b>easily</b> sold to nearby breweries.|$|R
30|$|Pollaris et al. [31] {{present a}} review of vehicle routing problems, some of which include vehicle balance and/or pickup and {{delivery}} constraints. While focusing on ground-based vehicles, many of the concepts <b>they</b> discuss <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> apply to aircraft as well.|$|R
5|$|Their roles imposed several design {{limitations}} on the vessels. The vessels were designed to operate in coastal areas, which required a shallow draft {{in order for them}} to be able to enter any port on the Baltic seaboard. They also required a heavy armament, {{in order for them to}} be able to engage any hostile ironclad on equal terms. Because Stosch envisioned only local deployments for the vessels, they had limited coal stowage, as <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> replenish their supply.|$|E
5|$|The first {{seaplanes}} used in combat, {{supplied by}} French manufacturer Donnet-Lévêque, were operated from Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand {{and her two}} sisters during the blockade. However, the Austro-Hungarian Navy was {{not satisfied with the}} operation, as the ships lacked enough deck space for the planes, as well as a lack of cranes with which <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> hoist the planes onto the decks. The planes were later moved to a hangar at the navy yard in Teodo. By 1913, the four new dreadnoughts of the —the only dreadnoughts built for the fleet—were coming into active service. With the commissioning of these dreadnoughts, the navy shifted Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand and her sisters to the 2nd Division of the 1st Battle Squadron.|$|E
5|$|The reason no {{successful}} rescue {{was ever}} effected {{lies in the}} remoteness of the Hebrides from the anglophone world in the early 18th century. No reliable naval charts of the area became available until 1776. Without local assistance and knowledge, finding a captive in this wilderness would have required a significant expeditionary force. Nonetheless, the lack of action taken by Edinburgh society in general and her children in particular to retrieve {{one of their own}} is remarkable. The Kirk hierarchy, for example, made no attempt to contact her or convey news of her condition to the capital, yet <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> have done so. Whatever the call of morality and natural justice may have suggested, John Chiesley's daughter evidently did not command a sympathetic audience in her home town.|$|E
50|$|The Skaffie {{appeared}} {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century. These boats were initially small so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be <b>easily</b> beached but later versions were heavier when large harbours became prevalent. Their stems were rounded and had raked sterns.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} lateral control was basic to all {{aircraft}} designs; without it <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be <b>easily</b> or safely controlled in flight.|$|R
25|$|Even if Czechoslovakia officially {{declared}} {{equality of}} all citizens, {{members of the}} Hungarian minority were reluctant to apply for positions in diplomacy, army or state services because of fear that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be <b>easily</b> misused by foreign intelligence services, especially in time of threat to the country.|$|R
5|$|Thieu then {{authorized}} Operation Cuu Long, {{in which}} ARVN ground forces, including mechanized and armoured units, drove west and northwest up {{the eastern side}} of the Mekong River from 9 May – 1 July. A combined force of 110 Vietnamese Navy and 30 U.S. vessels proceeded up the Mekong to Prey Veng, permitting IV Corps ground forces to move westward to Phnom Penh and to aid ethnic Vietnamese seeking flight to South Vietnam. Those who did not wish to be repatriated were then forcibly expelled. Surprisingly, North Vietnamese forces did not oppose the evacuation, though <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> have done so.|$|E
5|$|While {{designed}} for smartness and equality, the Scout uniform is also practical. Shirts traditionally have thick seams {{to make them}} ideal for use in makeshift stretchers—Scouts were trained to use them in this way with their staves, a traditional but deprecated item. The leather straps and toggles of the campaign hats or Leaders' Wood Badges {{could be used as}} emergency tourniquets, or anywhere that string was needed in a hurry. Neckerchiefs were chosen as <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> be used as a sling or triangular bandage by a Scout in need. Scouts were encouraged to use their garters for shock cord where necessary.|$|E
5|$|Zeus used {{mechanically}} steered radars, {{like the}} Nike SAMs before it, {{limiting the number}} of targets it could attack at once. A study by the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG) calculated that the Soviets had a 90 percent chance of successfully hitting a Zeus base by firing only four warheads at it. These did not even have to land close in order to destroy the base; an explosion within several miles would destroy its radars, which were very difficult to harden. If the Soviets did have hundreds of missiles, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> afford to use some to attack the Zeus sites.|$|E
50|$|Unlike Seawise Giant {{and most}} other ULCCs, the Batillus class vessels had twin screws, twin boilers of full size and power, and twin rudders. As a result, in an {{emergency}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> more <b>easily</b> and safely be operated than with a single propeller and a single boiler.|$|R
30|$|Current in vivo test {{systems are}} mostly {{developed}} for human neurotoxicity assessment, although <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be <b>easily</b> adapted for ecological use. The current systems mostly {{do not allow}} large-scale screening. To be able to screen all relevant environmental contaminants for their neurotoxic potential, novel screening approaches are needed.|$|R
50|$|Following this, in 2014 {{the local}} {{residents}} groups formed their own party, Residents for Uttlesford, so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> more <b>easily</b> stand {{a larger number}} of candidates across their electoral District. A number of existing councillors crossed the aisle to join the new party when it was launched.|$|R
5|$|I {{had settled}} {{an affair with}} five gentlemen of that country who were each of them to raise a {{regiment}} of dragoons well mounted and well armed which I knew <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> do for the men had horses and homes of their own, and were, to say the truth most of them, the persons who some time since robbed the late Bishop of Winchester's Park, and have increased in their number ever since. They go {{by the name of}} the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which is a most loyal little town...I once saw two hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half a mile of my house. They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. I am told there is no less than a thousand of them and indeed I believe they have now taken loyalty into their heads, and will I hope prove very useful.|$|E
5|$|The stouter {{build and}} more bent {{shape of the}} {{mandible}} shows that the Rodrigues starling used greater force than the hoopoe starling when searching and perhaps digging for food. It probably also {{had the ability to}} remove objects and forcefully open entrances when searching for food; it did this by inserting its wedge-shaped bill and opening its mandibles, as other starlings and crows do. This ability supports Tafforet's claim that the bird fed on eggs and dead tortoises. It could have torn dead, presumably juvenile, turtles and tortoises out of their shells. Tafforet did not see any Rodrigues starlings on the mainland, but he stated that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> be reared by feeding them meat, which indicates that he brought young birds from a breeding population on Île Gombrani. Tafforet was marooned on Rodrigues during the summer and was apparently able to procure juvenile individuals; some other Rodrigues birds are known to breed at this time, so {{it is likely that the}} starling did the same.|$|E
5|$|At 09:30 on 2 May, Oan {{appeared}} at the first-floor window of the embassy to demand access to the telex system, which the police had disabled along with the telephone lines, and threatened to kill Abdul Fazi Ezzati, the cultural attaché. The police refused and Oan pushed Ezzati, who he had been holding at gunpoint at the window, across the room, before demanding to speak to somebody from the BBC who knew Sim Harris. The police, relieved to have a demand to which <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> agree, produced Tony Crabb, managing director of BBC Television News and Harris's boss. Oan shouted his demands—for safe passage out of the UK, to be negotiated by three ambassadors from Arab countries—to Crabb from the first-floor window, and instructed {{that they should be}} broadcast along with a statement of the hostage-takers' aims by the BBC. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office informally approached the embassies of Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria and Qatar to ask if their ambassadors would be willing to talk to the hostage-takers. The Jordanian ambassador immediately refused and the other five said they would consult their governments. The BBC broadcast the statement that evening, but in a form unsatisfactory to Oan, who considered it to be truncated and incorrect.|$|E
50|$|It was a {{low wing}} {{cantilever}} monoplane with plywood covered, two spar wooden wings of trapezoidal plan apart from slightly rounded tips. They were mounted with about 2° of dihedral on a very short centre section from which <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be <b>easily</b> demounted. There were long, narrow chord ailerons.|$|R

50|$|General Maxwell, {{commanding}} the New Jersey Brigade, {{set up a}} defense at defiles {{on the road to}} Connecticut Farms. After a day of hot fighting, the British realized <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>easily</b> breakthrough toward the Hobart Gap leading to Morristown, and, after burning the town, retired back to Elizabeth point.|$|R
5|$|The {{crews of}} the American {{merchant}} vessels possessed only small arms, but their escort, Experiment, {{was a much}} more powerful vessel. Commanded by William Maley, the 135-ton Experiment was armed with 12 six-pounder guns and had a complement of 70 men. In comparison, Rigaud's initial attack force consisted of eleven barges crewed by 40 to 50 men each in the smaller ones, and 60 or 70 in the larger vessels. These barges were primarily propelled by oars, with 26 per vessel. The Haitian craft were each equipped {{with a mix of}} swivel guns and four-pounder cannon, with most vessels armed with two or three guns as well as small arms. In addition to the vessels that set out to attack the convoy, there were more barges and men nearby that the Haitians could call upon if reinforcements were needed. In total some 37 barges and 1500 men were at Rigaud's immediate disposal, though the Americans did not know this during the attack. Individually the Haitian barges presented only a small threat to the convoy, but when attacking en masse <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> overwhelm and capture the American ships if they managed to board them.|$|E
5|$|While {{cyberpunk}} {{remained a}} core {{part of the}} game, the team were faced with the trouble that no-one really knew what cyberpunk was any more: the most recent game and film references they had were from the early 2000s, as many works {{that might have been}} classed as cyberpunk were now being treated as science fiction. While <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> have replicated the atmosphere of films like Blade Runner, the team wanted to create something original within the genre. Something that concerned the team was about portraying the world of Human Revolution in relation to the original Deus Ex, which chronologically took place 25 years later: while the original Deus Ex used technological elements common {{at the time it was}} made such as 4:3 aspect ratio monitors and landline telephones, Human Revolution used mobiles and wide-screen televisions. According to Jacques-Belletête, this separation was ultimately put down to the differing portrayals of the world between the two games: while Deus Ex was set in poor communities and focused on the social impact of new technology, Human Revolution focused on the high end of society and technology's physical impact.|$|E

50|$|Joseph Brant's Volunteers usually wore {{civilian}} attire. In {{order to}} avoid confusion during battle, he had his men wear yellow lace on their hats so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be <b>easily</b> identified as British Loyalists. Brant's men, at least on one occasion, dressed as Indians to disguise themselves while raiding their former Patriot neighbors.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "stool pigeon" [...] {{originates}} {{from the}} long-ago practice of tying a passenger pigeon to a stool. The bird would flap its wings in a futile attempt to escape.
