Bryan Singer in particular felt <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> was going to hire a non-American actor for the role. At the time of the casting session, actor Hugh Laurie was in Namibia filming the movie Flight of the Phoenix. He assembled an audition tape in a hotel bathroom, the only place with enough light, and apologized for its appearance (which Singer compared to a [...] "bin Laden video"). Laurie improvised, using an umbrella for a cane. Singer was very impressed by his performance and commented on how well the [...] "American actor" [...] was able to grasp the character. Singer was not aware that Laurie was English, due to his convincing American accent. Laurie credits the accent to [...] "a misspent youth [...] too much TV and too many movies". Although locally better-known actors such as Denis Leary, David Cross, Rob Morrow, and Patrick Dempsey were considered for the part, Shore, Jacobs, and Attanasio were as impressed as Singer and cast Laurie as House.|$|E

[...] Everyone present began cheering and then marched out of the room; the abandoned Harriman shook his head in dismay.|$|E

[...] The stadium didn't have nearly enough parking, and the neighborhood around it had already gone to seed. [...] To that end, he sold the park to Philadelphia Eagles owner Jerry Wolman in 1964, taking a million-dollar loss on his purchase of just 10 years earlier. [...] The Phillies remained at the old stadium until 1970. [...] In the last game played there, the Phillies avoided last place by beating the Expos 2–1.|$|E

And I realized I wasn't getting any more words out of him. So I had to write a song a day so there was enough. Graham came with a couple of things, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> would come with enough songs to fill {{out the rest of the}} record. So I took an instant editorial decision that was what was going to happen. Some of those words stayed, and some of those words got worked on by Graham and me. That was it, basically." [...] The band worked on more than a dozen songs, dropping those that were not [...] "working quite well enough". Many of the songs were recorded in a single take, the band playing as a threesome: [...] "You have to understand, as a three-piece, we'd very rarely played together. [...] So [...] I thought, 'Let's see how it goes in the studio.' We worked with an engineer that we'd never worked with before, who was Irish. We did 'Moreover,' and after we were done playing, he came in and said, 'You make a big fookin' noise for three.'" [...] The band felt vindicated.|$|E
