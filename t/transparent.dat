5|$|The {{new process}} {{referred}} to in the announcement was the use of dry slabs of <b>transparent</b> gelatin, used as an adhesive layer for the fixation of the silver salts over the paper.|$|E
5|$|The protoplasmodium, a microscopic, {{undifferentiated}} granular {{mass with}} a slime sheath, is <b>transparent</b> and colourless. A single sporangiophore (the fruiting structure) is produced from the semispherical protoplasmodium, which is approximately {{one and a}} half times the diameter of mature sporangia. It acquires dark spots as it matures and the centre of the protoplasm later becomes dark. Then, the <b>transparent</b> and milk-white protoplasmodium climbs along the stem to the top, where first the capillitium and peridium and finally the spores are produced. At room temperature, this process lasts roughly one day.|$|E
5|$|The song is also {{featured}} in the television shows Hit the Floor, Wonderland, Selfie, Unreal, <b>Transparent,</b> Shades of Blue, American Dad!, and Dance Moms.|$|E
5|$|The spores are elliptical, smooth, {{and have}} {{dimensions}} of 3.5–5 by 2–2.5µm. They have thin walls, and {{are covered by}} a <b>transparent</b> envelope.|$|E
5|$|After {{conducting}} a critical study of Opus Dei, journalist John L. Allen, Jr. concluded that Opus Dei should (1) be more <b>transparent,</b> (2) collaborate {{with members of}} religious institutes, and (3) encourage its members to air out in public their criticisms of the institution.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium-doped ZnO layers {{are used}} as <b>transparent</b> electrodes. The {{constituents}} Zn and Al are much cheaper and less toxic compared to the generally used indium tin oxide (ITO). One application which {{has begun to be}} commercially available is the use of ZnO as the front contact for solar cells or of liquid crystal displays.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} {{differentiation}} of snake scales is a <b>transparent</b> scale called the brille or spectacle which covers {{the eye of}} the snake. The brille {{is often referred to as}} a fused eyelid. It is shed as part of the old skin during moulting.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, {{the main}} floor will feature <b>transparent</b> cornered project fascades and clear glass street level views.

5|$|Because gallium wets {{glass or}} porcelain, gallium {{can be used}} to create {{brilliant}} mirrors. When the wetting action of gallium-alloys is not desired (as in Galinstan glass thermometers), the glass must be protected with a <b>transparent</b> layer of gallium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Cylinders {{containing}} gases {{other than}} air or medical oxygen {{must have a}} <b>transparent</b> adhesive label stuck on below the shoulder with the word NITROX or TRIMIX in green and {{the composition of the}} gas listed.|$|E
5|$|For {{about the}} next –, the excess {{electrons}} remained too energetic to bind with atomic nuclei. What followed is a period known as recombination, when neutral atoms were formed and the expanding universe became <b>transparent</b> to radiation.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1950s {{through the late}} 1970s, ant farms were popular {{educational}} children's toys in the United States. Some later commercial versions use <b>transparent</b> gel instead of soil, allowing greater visibility {{at the cost of}} stressing the ants with unnatural light.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{specimens}} of widgiemoolthalite {{tend to be}} bluish-green though may also be grass-green in rare cases. Widgiemoolthalite is <b>transparent</b> in hand sample with a silky luster and a pale bluish-green streak. The mineral is brittle and breaks along its fiber contacts. Its observed specific gravity is 3.13 while its calculated specific gravity is 3.24, with a hardness of 3.5 on the Mohs scale.|$|E
5|$|He {{seemingly}} rejected {{some aspects}} of van Eyckian realism, notably in his depictions of shadows, and his unwillingness to apply <b>transparent</b> glazes. As a colourist, Lochner was more inclined towards the International Gothic style, even if this inhibited realism. He did not utilise the newly developed Netherlandish techniques of representing perspective, but rather indicated distance through the diminution of parallel objects.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Nanotek Instruments {{spun off}} Angstron Materials {{for the purpose}} of mass-producing {{graphene}} materials. Angstron Materials, also located in Dayton, is currently the world's largest producer of nano graphene platelets. Angstron's graphene platelets are being used in multiple research areas including energy storage, thermal management, nanocomposites, <b>transparent</b> conducting films, sensor, and lithium ion batteries.|$|E
5|$|In October, Jenner {{presented}} the Point Foundation's Horizon Award to television producers Rhys Ernst (of the show <b>Transparent)</b> and Zach Zyskowski (of the show Becoming Us). This was her second public speaking engagement after her gender transition.|$|E
5|$|Indium(III) oxide and indium {{tin oxide}} (ITO) are used as a <b>transparent</b> {{conductive}} coating on glass substrates in electroluminescent panels. Indium tin oxide {{is used as a}} light filter in low-pressure sodium-vapor lamps. The infrared radiation is reflected back into the lamp, which increases the temperature within the tube and improves the performance of the lamp.|$|E
5|$|Lily, a {{reformed}} supervillainess and former girlfriend of Dr. Impossible and CoreFire. She claims {{to come from}} the far future, having been sent back to prevent an ecological disaster that would destroy humanity.

5|$|Littleton {{retired from}} {{teaching}} in 1977 {{to focus on}} his own art. Exploring the inherent qualities of the medium, he worked in series with simple forms {{to draw attention to}} the complex interplay of <b>transparent</b> glass with multiple overlays of thin color.|$|E
5|$|Medaka and {{zebrafish}} {{are used}} as research models for studies in genetics and developmental biology. The zebrafish is {{the most commonly used}} laboratory vertebrate, offering the advantages of genetic similarity to mammals, small size, simple environmental needs, <b>transparent</b> larvae permitting non-invasive imaging, plentiful offspring, rapid growth, and the ability to absorb mutagens added to their water.|$|E
5|$|Most {{reviews of}} the {{collection}} were positive, applauding how Dalrymple had utilised his experiences to create a work that gives a <b>transparent</b> look at poverty in England. The main detraction that reviewers had for the collection was that Dalrymple often became too opinionated in his writing while {{he was trying to}} get across the results of his experiences.|$|E
5|$|Possible reforms {{might be}} for {{prospective}} candidates {{to have the right}} to publicly respond to negative accusations before the PEC, and for the PEC to be more <b>transparent</b> with regard to the reasons for their decisions concerning the eligibility of candidates. A more democratized process open to public scrutiny would give citizens a role to play, thus enhancing the notion of representative democracy.|$|E
5|$|Python 2.0 was {{released}} on 16 October 2000 and had many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode. With this release the development process was changed and became more <b>transparent</b> and community-backed.|$|E
5|$|The LS3/5A (each element {{pronounced}} separately, {{without the}} stroke) {{is a small}} studio monitor loudspeaker originated by the BBC for use by outside broadcast vans to ensure quality of their broadcasts.

5|$|The iPad 2 is {{compatible}} with iOS 7, which was released on September 18, 2013. However, some features are not supported. For example, like the iPhone 4, the Notification Center and the Control Center use the <b>transparent</b> style instead of the translucent style in later iOS models.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{members of}} the family are the -long bull crickets (Brachytrupes) which {{excavate}} burrows a metre or more deep. The tree crickets (Oecanthinae) are delicate white or pale green insects with <b>transparent</b> fore wings, while the field crickets (Gryllinae) are robust brown or black insects.|$|E
5|$|The {{photosphere}} is {{that portion}} of a star that is visible to an observer. This is the layer at which the plasma of the star becomes <b>transparent</b> to photons of light. From here, the energy generated at the core becomes free to propagate into space. It is within the photosphere that sun spots, regions of lower than average temperature, appear.|$|E
5|$|<b>Transparent</b> {{thin-film}} transistors (TTFT) can {{be produced}} with ZnO. As field-effect transistors, they even may not need a p–n junction, thus avoiding the p-type doping problem of ZnO. Some of the field-effect transistors even use ZnO nanorods as conducting channels.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} neutral atoms formed from {{a sea of}} {{primordial}} ions, space became <b>transparent</b> to radiation, releasing the energy viewed today as the microwave background radiation. The expanding Universe then underwent a Dark Age {{due to the lack}} of stellar energy sources.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transparent</b> OLEDs: <b>Transparent</b> OLEDs use <b>transparent</b> or semi-transparent {{contacts}} on {{both sides}} of the device to create displays that can be made to be both top and bottom emitting (<b>transparent).</b> TOLEDs can greatly improve contrast, making it much easier to view displays in bright sunlight. This technology can be used in Head-up displays, smart windows or augmented reality applications.|$|E
