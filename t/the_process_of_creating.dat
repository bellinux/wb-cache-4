5|$|Antichrist Superstar was {{recorded}} at Nothing Studios in New Orleans by an extensive group of musicians, {{including members of}} Marilyn Manson (namely the band's eponymous vocalist, Twiggy Ramirez, Madonna Wayne Gacy, Daisy Berkowitz, and Ginger Fish) and Nine Inch Nails (guitarists Robin Finck and Danny Lohner, and drummer Chris Vrenna). Manson, Trent Reznor and frequent Nine Inch Nails mixer Sean Beavan produced the record, alongside former Skinny Puppy member and longtime producer Dave Ogilvie. <b>The</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> the album was reputedly a long and difficult one, highlighted by experiments involving sleep deprivation, near-constant drug use, as well as self-harm, with Manson indicating that he would regularly insert sewing needles underneath his own fingernails. During this time, antagonism between band members was high, with most of this directed toward founding member Daisy Berkowitz.|$|E

5|$|In 1890, Goebel was a {{delegate}} to Kentucky's fourth constitutional convention, which produced the current Kentucky Constitution.

The convention was in session for 250 days; Goebel was present for just 100 of them. He did, however, successfully secure {{the inclusion of the}} Railroad Commission in the new constitution. As a constitutional entity, the Commission could only be abolished by an amendment ratified by popular vote.

5|$|In 2013, Todd Ocvirk, Nanette Napoleon, Justin Vance, Anita Manning {{and others}} began <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> a {{historical}} documentary {{film about the}} individual experiences and stories of Hawaii-born soldiers and sailors of the Civil War, including Pitman, Samuel C.

In 2014, Maui-based author Wayne Moniz wrote a fictionalized story based on the lives and Civil War service of Hawaiian soldiers like Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman in his book Pukoko: A Hawaiian in the American Civil War. In 2015, the sesquicentennial {{of the end of}} the war, the National Park Service released a publication titled Asians and Pacific Islanders and the Civil War about the service of the large number of combatants of Asian and Pacific Islander descent who fought during the war. The history of Hawaiʻi's involvement and the biographies of Pitman, Bush, Kealoha and others were co-written by historians Anita Manning and Justin Vance.|$|E
