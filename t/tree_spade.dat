50|$|In 1963, {{experimentation}} {{began on}} the development of a mechanical tree-moving machine. A few months later, the Vermeer TM-700 was introduced. This was the first machine designed to dig, transport, and replant large trees. About four years later, the Vermeer <b>tree</b> <b>spade</b> was introduced. The first machine, model TS-44, had immediate acceptance and more than 400 units were sold the first year.|$|E
50|$|The {{conventional}} {{bucket of}} many skid loaders {{can be replaced}} {{with a variety of}} specialized buckets or attachments, many powered by the loader's hydraulic system. These include backhoe, hydraulic breaker, pallet forks, angle broom, sweeper, auger, mower, snow blower, stump grinder, <b>tree</b> <b>spade,</b> trencher, dumping hopper, ripper, tillers, grapple, tilt, roller, snow blade, wheel saw, cement mixer, and wood chipper machine.|$|E
50|$|A <b>tree</b> <b>spade</b> is a {{specialized}} machine that mechanizes the transplanting of large plants whose hand-powered transplanting (using traditional spades, wagons, and other equipment) would be prohibitively laborious. These include large bushes and small or medium trees. By bringing mechanized power {{to what was}} formerly only a manual process, tree spades do for transplanting what tractors and combine harvesters do for agriculture, and what excavators and other heavy equipment do for construction. Today, tree spades are widely used in the tree nursery industry to increase production rates, and in the landscaping industry for tree removal and transplanting.|$|E
5000|$|The {{machines}} can {{be mounted}} on a tractor or loader for moving trees a short distance, or {{on the back of}} a truck [...] for relocating trees over the highway a long distance away. For tree nursery operations, <b>tree</b> <b>spades</b> are also sometimes mounted on excavators, though this is less common due to the weight capacity requirements of manipulating the machine along with an excavated tree. For transport on public roads, the <b>spade</b> tilts the <b>tree</b> to a near-horizontal position in order to clear overhead bridges and cables.|$|R
5000|$|A typical machine {{consists}} {{of a number of}} blades (generally 3 or 4, but single or dual blade designs also exist) that encircle the tree, digging into the ground and then lifting the entire tree, including its roots and soil (in what is termed a [...] "root ball"), out of the ground and replanting or transplanting the whole tree in the designated area. Similar machines can also be used for placing trees in pots or baskets for commercial tree nursery operations. <b>Tree</b> <b>spades</b> are available {{in a wide variety of}} sizes and designs that are made to suit varied soil conditions and customer requirements. Typical design variations can include straight vs curved blades, root ball diameter, root ball depth, and root ball cone angle.|$|R
50|$|When {{they reached}} the king, he had decreed that whoever tried and failed would have his ears clipped off and be put on a deserted island. The two older tried, failed, and {{suffered}} the punishment. The youngest set the axe to cut down the <b>tree,</b> the <b>spade</b> to dig the well, and the nut to fill it.|$|R
50|$|Annuals {{are sold}} in trays (undivided {{containers}} with multiple plants), flats (trays with built-in cells), peat pots, or plastic pots. Perennials and woody plants are sold either in pots, bare-root or balled and burlapped and {{in a variety of}} sizes, from liners to mature trees. Balled and Burlap (B & B) trees are dug either by hand or by a loader that has a <b>tree</b> <b>spade</b> attachment {{on the front of the}} machine. Although container grown woody plants are becoming more and more popular due to the versatility, B & B is still widely used throughout the industry.|$|E
50|$|Looming land {{development}} threatened the rare patch of prairie. But a heroic {{effort by the}} Park District {{and members of the}} public resulted in the prairie being moved to Marquette Park. In the spring in 1993, the Park District dug up several plugs of prairie using a <b>tree</b> <b>spade.</b> Each plug measured four to five feet across. With the important roots of these prairie plant plugs intact, crews carefully transported these huge plugs to Marquette Park. There, the rescue team drilled holes and installed the huge plugs {{near the edge of the}} lagoon. Fortunately, the soil profile at the old site was similar to the soil profile at the new site, and overall the prairie rescue was a success. Most of the flowers bloomed the very first year in their new home. As the prairie began to settle into its new home, prairie reconstruction activities continued. Volunteers seeded, planted and weeded between the tree-spaded remnants, and in the areas north of the remnants. To this day, Ashburn Prairie thrives on the commitment of dedicated volunteer stewards.|$|E
40|$|Gas {{exchange}} {{and growth of}} transplanted and nontransplanted, field-grown Norway maple (Acer platanoides L. `Schwedleri 2 ̆ 7) and littleleaf linden (Tilia cordata Mill. `Greenspire 2 ̆ 7) trees were investigated in an arid climate. In the spring of 1995, three trees of each species were moved with a <b>tree</b> <b>spade</b> to a new location within a field nursery and three nontransplanted trees were selected as controls. Predawn leaf water potential, morning-to-evening stomatal conductance and leaf temperature, leaf-to-air vapor pressure difference, midday stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate, and growth data were collected over a 2 -year period. After transplanting, weekly predawn leaf water potential indicated that transplanted trees were under greater water stress than were nontransplanted (control) trees. However, predawn leaf water potential of maple trees recovered to control levels 18 weeks after transplanting, while that of transplanted linden trees remained more negative than that of controls. In 1995, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rates were lower throughout the day for transplanted trees. In 1996, gas exchange rates of transplanted maple trees recovered to near control levels while rates for transplanted linden trees did not. Sensitivity of stomata to leaf-to-air vapor pressure difference varied with species and with transplant treatment. Each year transplanted trees of both species had less apical growth than did control trees. Although gas {{exchange and}} apical growth of transplanted trees was reduced following transplanting, recovery of gas exchange to control rates differed with species...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1990 ’s Eucalyptus gomphocephala (tuart) {{has been}} {{suffering}} a significant decline in Yalgorup National Park, approximately 100 km south of Perth Western Australia. Symptoms range from chronic deterioration to sudden mass collapse. The role of Phytophthora pathogens was investigated because the progressive canopy thinning, dieback and heterogeneous {{distribution of the}} decline were similar to other forest declines caused by a range of Phytophthora species which are widespread throughout south-west Western Australia and worldwide. In combination with sampling for Phytophthora isolation, an initial diagnostic trial tested the effect of trunk applied phosphite, nutrients and combined phosphite and nutrients on natural stands of declining E. gomphocephala. Phosphite injection {{was used as a}} diagnostic tool to identify the possible role of Phytophthora pathogens because the chemical specifically suppresses Phytophthora pathogens and has no known direct fertilizer effect on the host. A range of nutrient treatments was also applied as a diagnostic tool to indicate what nutrient deficiencies may be involved in the decline. Initially no Phytophthora species were isolated from the treatment sites. However, individual and combined injection treatments of phosphite and nutrients improved the crown health over four years with the greatest improvement from treatments of phosphite and zinc sulphide. In combination with further rhizosphere sampling for Phytophthora species, the response of declining trees to phosphite application was further investigated in a second injection trial. Phosphite concentrations from 75 to 375 g phosphite/L improved crown health compared to the control, with the best improvement at 150 g phosphite/L. The positive response of declining trees to phosphite injection implicated a Phytophthora pathogen, despite no Phytophthora species being isolated at this time. Consequently further work was undertaken to determine the involvement of Phytophthora species. Concurrently to both injection trials, several seedling bioassays were conducted. The first bioassay tested the effect of pasteurising soil from a declining site within Yalgorup and healthy sites outside the Yalgorup woodland on E. gomphocephala seedlings grown ex situ. Seedling growth ex situ was not significantly reduced in nonpasteurised soil compared to the pasteurised soils from declining sites, and no Phytophthora species was isolated. To further investigate the disease the fine root and ectomycorrhizal systems of the largest main lateral root of 18 declining E. gomphocephala trees within Yalgorup were exposed using an air spade. Necrotic roots were sampled and the crown, fine root and ectomycorrhizal health were assessed. No Phytophthora species was isolated from necrotic roots; however, crown health of the declining trees was significantly correlated with the fine root and ectomycorrhizae density, suggesting that below ground damage could be involved in the decline. The relationship between the above and below ground health of the air <b>spaded</b> <b>trees</b> was investigated further using an in situ and ex situ seedling bioassay. In the in situ bioassay, seedlings were planted within the exposed root mats of the air <b>spaded</b> <b>trees.</b> In the ex situ bioassay, seedlings were grown within a glasshouse in pasteurised and non-pasteurised soil collected from the air spaded root mats. No Phytophthora species was identified in these bioassays, and seedlings grown ex situ in non-pasteurised soil showed no clear decline symptoms, but the health of the woodland trees was significantly correlated with seedling survival, foliar health and height of the seedlings An additional 32 sites throughout the E. gomphocephala range were sampled for the presence of Phytophthora pathogens using a modified sampling and isolation procedure. From this survey a new Phytophthora species was isolated from five sites from the roots of declining E. gomphocephala, E. marginata and Agonis flexuosa at Yalgorup National Park. Morphologically similar to P. citricola, the new Phytophthora species is unique based on phylogenetic analysis of the ITS and Cox 1 gene regions and was named P. multivora. Phytophthora multivora has subsequently been isolated from all experimental sites showing tuart decline. Two experiments tested the pathogenicity of P. multivora to E. gomphocephala and E. marginata. The first experiment examined ex situ the pathogenicity of five P. multivora isolates and one P. cinnamomi isolate on the root systems of E. gomphocephala and one P. multivora isolate on the root system of E. marginata. In the second experiment, the pathogenicity of P. multivora to E. gomphocephala and E. marginata saplings was measured in situ using under-bark stem inoculation. Phytophthora multivora isolates caused significant fine root loss and lesion extension in under-bark inoculated stems of both E. gomphocephala and E. marginata. Phytophthora multivora was also reisolated from necrotic fine roots and lesions of inoculated saplings of both E. gomphocephala and E. marginata, thus satisfying Koch’s postulates. No seedlings died in these pathogenicity trials and P. multivora was not reisolated from beyond the fine roots. There was evidence that P. multivora significantly contributes to E. gomphocephala decline by episodically causing fine root damage leading to chronic deterioration of the trees...|$|R
