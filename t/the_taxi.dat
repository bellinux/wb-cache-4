40|$|Bibliography: pages 142 - 152. In recent years, the South African {{transportation}} system has witnessed {{the rise of}} intermediate forms of transport, in particular <b>the</b> kombi <b>taxi.</b> Though {{referred to as a}} <b>taxi,</b> <b>the</b> kombi <b>taxi</b> differs from <b>the</b> typical sedan <b>taxi.</b> As a <b>taxi,</b> <b>the</b> kombi is a minibus vehicle, typically of Volkswagen, Toyota or Datsun make. In South Africa, <b>the</b> kombi <b>taxi</b> is legally allowed a maximum passenger capacity of eight, whereas <b>the</b> sedan <b>taxi</b> is generally licenced to carry a maximum of five passengers. In terms of patronage, <b>the</b> sedan <b>taxi</b> is more often used by businessmen and holidaymakers, as well as commuting youngsters and the elderly on a sporadic basis. Like <b>the</b> sedan <b>taxi,</b> <b>the</b> kombi <b>taxi</b> is privately owned and operated. However, <b>the</b> kombi <b>taxi</b> is used on a more regular basis and frequently conveys passengers along a set route, operating more like a bus service than a taxi service. Fares charged by kombi taxi drivers are set according to route as opposed to the metered rate charged by <b>the</b> sedan <b>taxi</b> operator. <b>The</b> kombi <b>taxi</b> is used by the non-white community in particular and has become a feature of commuter demand satisfaction. Interest in the South African kombi taxi was sparked {{as a result of the}} 1983 Commission of Inquiry into Bus Passenger Transport (Welgemoed, 1983). The report, among other things, considered <b>the</b> effect of <b>taxis</b> on <b>the</b> bus industry and covered future transportation policy. One of the recommendations of the Welgemoed Commission was that <b>the</b> kombi <b>taxi</b> be phased out over a four-year period in order to protect existing and future bus services in the Republic. Given the spatial patterning of South African cities and the important role of intermediate forms of transportation in filling an existing mobility/demand gap, it became apparent that the issue of <b>the</b> kombi <b>taxi</b> required further I analysis in order that its role and function as part of the South African {{transportation system}} could be better understood. Thus, the Cape Town Metropolitan Transportation Area was chosen for specific study...|$|R

5|$|Brown is {{credited}} {{with a number of}} American football innovations.

He also played a role in breaking professional football's color barrier, bringing some of the first African-Americans to play pro football in the modern era onto his teams. Despite these accomplishments, Brown was not universally liked. He was strict and controlling, which often brought him into conflict with players who wanted a greater say in play-calling. These disputes, combined with Brown's failure to consult Modell on major personnel decisions, led to his firing as the Browns' coach in 1963.|$|E
