5|$|Birds {{in central}} California of the {{subspecies}} propinquus {{are considered to}} be still increasing <b>their</b> <b>range,</b> and this is probably the case elsewhere in the U.S.A.|$|E
5|$|At {{least seven}} species of millipedes in the genera Apheloria and Brachoria (Xystodesmidae) form a Müllerian mimicry {{ring in the}} eastern United States, in which {{unrelated}} polymorphic species converge on similar colour patterns where <b>their</b> <b>range</b> overlaps.|$|E
5|$|At the {{southern}} part of <b>their</b> <b>range,</b> the Arctic tern has been reducing in numbers. Much of this is due to lack of food. However, most of these birds' range is extremely remote, with no apparent trend in the species as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Choughs {{breed in}} mountains, from Morocco and Spain eastwards through {{southern}} Europe and the Alps, across Central Asia and the Himalayas to western China. The Alpine chough {{is also found}} in Corsica and Crete, and the red-billed chough has populations in Ireland, the UK, the Isle of Man, and two areas of the Ethiopian Highlands. Both species are non-migratory residents throughout <b>their</b> <b>range,</b> only occasionally wandering to neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, tigers became {{extinct in}} Western and Central Asia, and were {{restricted}} to isolated pockets {{in the remaining}} parts of <b>their</b> <b>range.</b> They were extirpated {{on the island of}} Bali in the 1940s, around the Caspian Sea in the 1970s, and on Java in the 1980s. This was the result of habitat loss and the ongoing killing of tigers and tiger prey. Today, their significantly fragmented and depopulated range extends eastward from India to Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, North Korea and Russia. The northern limit of <b>their</b> <b>range</b> is close to the Amur River in southeastern Siberia. The only large island they still inhabit is Sumatra. Since the beginning of the 20th century, tigers' historical range has shrunk by 93%. In the decade from 1997 to 2007, the estimated area known to be occupied by tigers has declined by 41%.|$|E
5|$|Females {{grow faster}} than males overall, {{and must be}} larger to mature sexually. In most populations males reach sexual {{maturity}} at 2–4years old, and females at 6–10. Size and age at maturity increase with latitude; at {{the northern edge of}} <b>their</b> <b>range,</b> males reach sexual maturity at 7–9years of age and females at 11–16.|$|E

5|$|From the {{opposite}} end of Europe (the Iberian Peninsula) came the few people who formed during the 2500-1900 BCE period the Bell-Beaker culture. It was named after the shape of their typical, carefully finished and precisely ornamented pottery. Southwestern Poland was at the eastern edge of <b>their</b> <b>range.</b> Because of their mobility, the Bell-Beaker people helped spread new inventions, including developing metallurgy, over large areas of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{hunting and}} habitat loss have {{severely}} impacted American alligator populations throughout <b>their</b> <b>range,</b> {{and whether the}} species would survive was in doubt. In 1967, the American alligator was listed as an endangered species (under a law that was the precursor Endangered Species Act of 1973), since it {{was believed to be}} in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 and 1970, 59 sea otters were {{translocated}} from Amchitka Island to Washington. Annual surveys between 2000 and 2004 {{have recorded}} between 504 and 743 individuals, and <b>their</b> <b>range</b> {{is in the}} Olympic Peninsula from just south of Destruction Island to Pillar Point.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century and early 20th century, fishers were {{virtually}} {{eliminated from the}} southern and eastern parts of <b>their</b> <b>range</b> including most American states and eastern Canada including Nova Scotia. Over-trapping and loss of forest habitat were {{the reasons for the}} decline.|$|E
5|$|Lontra canadensis {{is listed}} in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. They have been {{virtually}} eliminated through many parts of <b>their</b> <b>range,</b> especially around heavily populated areas in the midwestern and eastern United States. Appendix II lists species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction currently, but may become so unless trade is closely controlled.|$|E
5|$|Mobile {{devices are}} also useful for {{providing}} location information; either from inbuilt gps/location tracking or via cell site logs, which track the devices within <b>their</b> <b>range.</b> Such information {{was used to}} track down the kidnappers of Thomas Onofri in 2006.|$|E

5|$|The Itcha Range area {{is home to}} a {{grassland}} ecosystem that has not been found elsewhere in southern or central British Columbia. It is dominated by communities of Altai fescue and lichen. Extensive and diverse alpine and subalpine vegetation is also present in the area, some species of which are at the northernmost or southernmost of <b>their</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{red panda}} has been {{classified}} as Endangered by the IUCN because its wild population {{is estimated at}} less than 10,000 mature individuals and continues to decline due to habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and inbreeding depression, although red pandas are protected by national laws in <b>their</b> <b>range</b> countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{reintroduction}} effort off the Oregon coast was not successful. However, reintroductions in 1969 and 1970 off the Washington coast {{were very}} successful and sea otters have been expanding <b>their</b> <b>range</b> since. They have now entered the Strait of Juan de Fuca {{and can be}} found almost as far east as Pillar Point. Individuals have even been seen in the San Juan Islands and northern Puget Sound.|$|E
25|$|Black-footed cats use scent marking {{throughout}} <b>their</b> <b>ranges,</b> with males spraying urine up to 12 times an hour.|$|R
50|$|It {{is closely}} related to black spruce, and hybrids between the two are {{frequent}} where <b>their</b> <b>ranges</b> meet.|$|R
50|$|This bird {{is closely}} related to the hermit warbler, and the two species interbreed where <b>their</b> <b>ranges</b> overlap.|$|R
5|$|The serval is {{confined}} to Africa – it is rare in northern Africa and the Sahel, but widespread in southern Africa, where <b>their</b> <b>range</b> is reportedly expanding. In northern Africa, the serval is known only from Morocco and has been reintroduced in Tunisia, but is feared to be extinct in Algeria.|$|E
5|$|The turrets {{aboard the}} Nagato-class ships were {{replaced}} in the mid-1930s, using the turrets stored from the unfinished s. While in storage the turrets were modified to increase <b>their</b> <b>range</b> of elevation to –3°/+43°, which {{gave them a}} maximum range of , and their firing cycle was reduced to 21.5 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The woodland's {{position}} on the transition zone between the wheatbelt and the jarrah forest determines amphibian populations, with several species existing at the eastern or western limits of <b>their</b> <b>range.</b> Herpetofauna includes the western marsh frog (or golden flecked burrowing frog, Heleioporus barycragus) which is generally restricted to the western Darling Range. There are at least 98 species of bird in the woodland, including the almost flightless malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata).|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} very similar to the brown-headed {{nuthatch}} of the southeastern U.S. <b>Their</b> <b>ranges</b> have no overlap.|$|R
