5|$|The Clintons accrued {{several million}} dollars in legal fees during his presidency; the bills were paid off four years after he left office. Bill and Hillary Clinton have both {{received}} {{millions of dollars in}} book authorship fees. In 2016, Forbes reported Bill and Hillary Clinton made about $240 million in the 15 years from January 2001 to December 2015 (mostly from paid speeches, business consulting and book-writing). Also in 2016, CNN reported the Clintons combined to receive more than $153 million in paid speeches from 2001 until spring 2015. In May 2015, The Hill reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton have made more than $25 million in speaking fees since the start of 2014, and that Hillary Clinton also made $5 million or more from her book, Hard Choices, during the same time period. In July 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported {{that at the end of}} 2012, the Clintons were worth between $5 million and $25.5 million, and that in 2012 (the last year they were required to disclose the information) the Clintons made between $16 and $17 million, mostly from speaking fees earned by the former president. Clinton earned more than $104 million from paid speeches between 2001 and 2012. In June 2014, ABC News and The Washington Post reported <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> made more than $100 million giving paid speeches since leaving public office, and in 2008, the New York Times reported that the Clintons' income tax returns show they have made $109 million in the 8 years from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, including almost $92 million from his speaking and book-writing.|$|E
2500|$|Allegations {{were also}} made <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> {{engaged in a}} {{long-term}} extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. [...] <b>Clinton</b> denied ever <b>having</b> an affair with Flowers.|$|R
50|$|Armistead also {{investigated}} allegations <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> {{once used}} cocaine himself, providing material for R. Emmett Tyrrell, {{editor of the}} American Spectator, who published the (unsupported) allegations just before the 1996 presidential election.|$|R
5000|$|Starr drafted an {{impeachment}} referral to the House of Representatives {{in the fall}} of 1997, alleging that there was [...] "substantial and credible evidence" [...] <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> committed perjury regarding Hale's allegations.|$|R
25|$|On October 3, 2016, Drudge Report {{published}} an unfounded claim <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> an illegitimate child named Danney Williams, an allegation that Drudge Report itself had reported as debunked in 1999 {{based on a}} Time magazine article.|$|R
50|$|Kathleen Willey (born June 2, 1946) is {{a former}} White House {{volunteer}} aide who, on March 15, 1998, alleged on the TV news program 60 Minutes <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> sexually assaulted her on November 29, 1993, during his first term as President. She had been subpoenaed to testify in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.|$|R
5000|$|September 17 [...] - [...] A Republican campaigner, Phil Parlock, and his {{daughter}} were assaulted at a public appearance by John Edwards in Huntington, West Virginia. It was later revealed that he repeatedly attended Democratic rallies {{in the past to}} provoke responses from Democratic party supporters, and brought his young children along to hold signs. In one instance he held up a sign reading [...] "Vince Foster", insinuating <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> him murdered.|$|R
5000|$|The Bush {{campaign}} also {{engaged in}} fowl play, releasing live ducks at a Clinton campaign event while Bush supporters used duck calls. The campaign sought {{to draw attention}} to the notion <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> [...] "ducked" [...] the draft to avoid military service during the Vietnam War. A Bush campaign assistant secured 200 live chickens in preparation for a Clinton campaign event held in Madison, Wisconsin. The campaign had wanted ducks and not chickens, but compromised by pairing the chickens with duck calls.|$|R
50|$|The {{village was}} almost {{completely}} {{destroyed in the}} January 26, 2001 earthquake. It is estimated that 175 {{people died in the}} village on <b>that</b> day. <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> previously visited the village.|$|R
5000|$|He made {{frequent}} allegations <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> several affairs around Little Rock and had fathered a {{child out}} of wedlock named Danny Williams. (The Star tabloid later determined through a DNA test that Clinton was not Williams' father.) McIntosh posted a flier during Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign which read [...] "The Hottest Thing Going: Bill Clinton's Dick Will Keep Him From Running for President of the United States of America" [...] {{with a picture of}} Danny Williams. Secret Service agents were seen around Little Rock with paint scrapers removing the fliers.|$|R
50|$|The {{investigations}} {{included the}} investigation of the 1970s' real estate investment <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> and Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> made in a development known as Whitewater, re-opening of allegations <b>that</b> then Governor <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> sexually harassed an Arkansas state employee, and a reexamination of the death of White House aide Vincent Foster which multiple official investigations had found to be a suicide.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> won Georgia's electoral {{votes in the}} Presidential {{election}} of 1992 two years prior, Republicans capitalized on the unpopularity of Clinton's and Congressional Democrats' major initiatives, most notably the Clinton health care plan of 1993 and gun control measures as well as miscellaneous disputes regarding social issues to gain three House seats from Democrats. In doing so, Republicans held {{a majority of the}} seats of Georgia's delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives {{for the first time since}} Reconstruction. Republicans would gain an additional seat when Nathan Deal (GA-9) changed his political affiliation in April 1995.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{presents}} {{the fall of}} Srebrenica [...] "as a stage-managed ploy by the Bosnians and Americans to justify NATO military intervention against Serbia". Interviewee Srđa Trifković asserts that there are [...] "trustworthy witnesses" [...] who claim <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> indicated <b>that</b> [...] "5,000 dead Muslims would be the price of NATO intervention" [...] and that these witnesses believe that [...] "Srebrenica was deliberately sacrificed by Izetbegović {{in order to provide}} this burnt offering to the White House". The film also {{presents the}} Srebrenica [...] "civilian death toll as no larger than the number of Serbs killed in the surrounding area".|$|R
5000|$|This issue {{intensified}} {{with the}} October 30, 2007, Democratic debate at Drexel University, where Hillary Clinton {{came under fire}} about it from MSNBC moderator Tim Russert and from Democratic opponents. Russert displayed a document signed by President Clinton that specifically requested that certain records and communications involving her not be made public until 2012. When Russert asked Hillary Clinton whether she would lift the presidential order, Hillary Clinton responded by saying, [...] "That's not my decision to make." [...] A concurrent Newsweek investigation stated <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> requested the archivists hold back a large variety of documents. A few days later, <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> vigorously defended his wife's responses, saying that Russert's question was [...] "breathtakingly misleading" [...] and that Newsweeks article was off the mark, saying, [...] "She was incidental to the letter, it was done five years ago, it was a letter to speed up presidential releases, not to slow them down." [...] Factcheck.org subsequently concluded that Russert's claim was incorrect, <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> released White House records earlier and in greater numbers than his two immediate predecessors, {{and that there was}} not much Hillary Clinton could do to speed up the release of records involving her.However, on March 6, 2008, Federal archivists at the Clinton Presidential Library blocked the release of hundreds of pages of White House papers on pardons that the former president approved, including clemency for fugitive commodities trader Marc Rich, based on guidance provided by <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton.</b>|$|R
50|$|President George W. Bush made a {{personal}} visit and replaced the National Medal of Arts <b>that</b> President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> previously awarded Domino. The gold records {{were replaced by}} the RIAA and Capitol Records, which owned the Imperial Records catalogue.|$|R
2500|$|Hillary Clinton {{described}} the remarks as [...] "elitist, out of touch, and frankly patronizing." [...] Noting {{he had not}} chosen his words well, Obama subsequently explained his remarks, [...] "Lately {{there has been a}} little typical sort of political flare-up, because I said something that everybody knows is true, which {{is that there are a}} whole bunch of folks in small towns in Pennsylvania, in towns right here in Indiana, in my hometown in Illinois, who are bitter." [...] Obama had addressed similar themes in a 2004 interview with Charlie Rose, and his strategists countered <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> made similar comments in 1991.|$|R
2500|$|In {{writing about}} the 1998 {{impeachment}} of <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton,</b> Morrison wrote <b>that,</b> since Whitewater, <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> been mistreated because of his [...] "Blackness": ...|$|R
25|$|Starr {{served as}} a federal Court of Appeals judge and as {{solicitor}} general for George H. W. Bush. He received the most publicity for his tenure as independent counsel while <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> was U.S.president. Starr was initially appointed to investigate the suicide death of deputy White House counsel Vince Foster and the Whitewater real estate investments of <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton.</b> The three-judge panel charged with administering the Independent Counsel Act later expanded the inquiry into numerous areas including an extramarital affair <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> with Monica Lewinsky. After several years of investigation, Starr filed the Starr Report, which alleged <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> lied {{about the existence of}} the affair during a sworn deposition. The allegation lead to the impeachment of <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> and the five-year suspension of Clinton's law license.|$|R
500|$|Bill Oakley, who was {{a writer}} on The Simpsons at the time, {{came up with the}} idea for [...] "Two Bad Neighbors" [...] two years before {{production}} began. Oakley got the inspiration for the episode after the feud between the Bushes and the Simpson family, and two years later when he and Josh Weinstein became showrunners of The Simpsons, they assigned Ken Keeler to write it. Oakley said <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> been President of the United States for two years at the point when the episode went into production, so the feud had [...] "faded off into oblivion". The staff therefore thought it would be funny if the two parties encountered each other again.|$|R
50|$|Trump {{acknowledged}} {{making the}} remarks, but tried to deflect by saying <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> and Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> {{said and done}} worse.|$|R
50|$|The {{amendment}} {{requires a}} line-item veto {{to be established}} for the President. Section 1 establishes a definition of an unbalanced budget by stating that it is when public debt {{at the end of}} one fiscal year (September 30 of the calendar year) is greater than the preceding one. Section 2 allows the President to approve or disapprove of any part of any separate legislation except one that allows for the operation of Congress or the judiciary. Section 3 simply sends the disapproved items to the US House for separate consideration. Section 4 forces Congress to pass a line-item veto law after the amendment is ratified. The amendment is a direct result of an overturned law <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> in his second term as President.|$|R
50|$|Another theory alleged <b>that</b> President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> either {{known about}} the bombing in advance or had {{approved}} the bombing. It is also believed that the bombing {{was done by the}} government to frame the militia movement or enact antiterrorism legislation while using McVeigh as a scapegoat. Still other theories claim that McVeigh conspired with the CIA in plotting the bombing.|$|R
50|$|David Hale, {{the source}} of {{criminal}} allegations against the Clintons, claimed in November 1993 <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> pressured him into providing an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal. The allegations were regarded as questionable because Hale <b>had</b> not mentioned <b>Clinton</b> in reference to this loan during the original FBI investigation of Madison Guaranty in 1989; only after coming under indictment himself in 1993, did Hale make allegations against the Clintons. A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for {{their role in the}} Whitewater project. Jim Guy Tucker, Bill Clinton's successor as governor, was convicted of fraud and sentenced to four years of probation {{for his role in the}} matter. Susan McDougal served 18 months in prison for contempt of court for refusing to answer questions relating to Whitewater.|$|R
50|$|On August 5, 1994, Kenneth Starr became Independent Counsel {{to prosecute}} Whitewater participants, {{including}} Susan McDougal. Federal trial began in 1996. During that trial, the government's star witness, Arkansas banker and former municipal judge David Hale, claimed <b>that</b> then-Governor <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> discussed an illegal $300,000 loan with himself and McDougal. Hale was himself {{under investigation for}} having defrauded the Small Business Administration out of $3.2 million. He also unsuccessfully sought to have his brother Milas Hale corroborate his testimony against Clinton.|$|R
5000|$|News of the {{recording}} broke {{two days before the}} second 2016 presidential debate between Trump, the Republican nominee, and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump gave a statement in which he apologized for the video's content, but deflected by saying <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> [...] "said far worse to me on the golf course." [...] The recording provoked strong reactions by media figures and politicians across the political spectrum. Statements from Republican officials were varied. Some, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Trump's vice-presidential running mate Mike Pence, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, indicated their disapproval of Trump's words but did not renounce their support or call for his resignation from the ticket. Other Republicans, most prominently former presidential nominee John McCain, stated that they would no longer support Trump's presidential campaign, and some called for his withdrawal from the ticket. House Speaker Paul Ryan announced that he would no longer defend or support Trump's campaign, although he did not officially retract his endorsement of Trump. Bush resigned from his position as a host on NBC's Today show, while Trump would face allegations of sexual misconduct from several women before he would go on to win the election.|$|R
500|$|Clinton {{received}} sustained {{national attention}} {{for the first}} time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed assertions <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged [...] "causing pain in my marriage". This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign. During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described in her classic song [...] "Stand by Your Man", and later in the campaign about how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead. The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers and in retrospect, were ill-considered by her own admission. <b>Bill</b> said <b>that</b> in electing him, the nation would [...] "get two for the price of one", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume. Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article [...] "The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives. At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.|$|R
25|$|Netanyahu unsuccessfully {{called for}} the early release of Jonathan Pollard, an American serving a life {{sentence}} for passing secret U.S. documents to Israel in 1987. He has raised the issue at the Wye River Summit in 1998, where he claimed <b>that</b> U.S. President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> privately agreed to release Pollard. In 2002, Netanyahu visited Pollard at his North Carolina prison. The Israeli Prime Minister maintained contact with Pollard's wife, and was active in pressing the Obama administration to release Pollard.|$|R
50|$|Florida held an {{election}} {{for president of}} the United States on November 3, 1992. The race was extremely close -- so close in fact that some news networks mistakenly reported <b>that</b> Democratic challenger <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> won in the state, although incumbent President George H. W. Bush was eventually declared the winner. Bush received 40.89% of the vote to Clinton's 39.00%. The final result in Florida reflected the reluctance of many Southern states to back Clinton, although Clinton was polling well {{in other parts of the}} country.|$|R
5000|$|On June 9, 2017, Olson stated {{during a}} radio {{broadcast}} <b>that</b> former President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> {{admitted to the}} murder of White House aide Vincent Foster and had threatened former Attorney General Loretta Lynch with similar violence if she did not drop an investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. When subsequently asked for evidence to support his claims, Olson said: “In my discussion about Loretta Lynch and Vince Foster, I took the accusations a step too far. I regret my choice of words.” ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, he {{received}} a minor reprimand from the House for stating in a floor speech <b>that</b> President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> [...] "given aid and comfort to the enemy" [...] during the Vietnam War. In 1996, Dornan was a dark horse candidate for President of the United States, using his campaign primarily {{as a vehicle to}} continue to criticize Clinton. In a GOP debate in Iowa on January 13, Dornan called Clinton a [...] "criminal" [...] and a [...] "pathological liar." [...] When asked why voters should choose Dornan over his Republican rivals to challenge Clinton in the general election, he argued that he had more children and grandchildren than the others, with only Indiana Senator Richard Lugar coming anywhere near him on that score. [...] Dornan dropped out in order to run for reelection to his seat in the House.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, Rabinowitz {{wrote an}} {{editorial}} in the Wall Street Journal about Juanita Broaddrick, an Arkansas woman who alleged <b>that</b> then President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> raped her when he was attorney general of Arkansas. Rabinowitz wrote [...] "To encounter this woman, to hear the details of her story and the statements of the corroborating witnesses, was to understand that this was in fact an event that took place." [...] She also wrote approvingly of Republican presidential candidate John McCain in both the 2000 and 2008 U.S. presidential elections.|$|R
2500|$|Brown figured {{prominently}} {{in two ways}} in the Whitewater controversy of the Clinton presidential administration. Brown was investigating Clinton. Brown was contacted by David Hale, a municipal judge facing indictment for fraud, then functioning as a paid informant for the FBI. Under the auspices of Citizens United, Brown issued letters to 100,000 donors to Citizens United, asking for money and saying that he <b>had</b> proof <b>that</b> President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> engaged [...] "in a massive cover-up and conspiracy to obstruct justice" [...] in the investigations surrounding the Whitewater controversy. At {{the same time that}} Brown was investigating the Clintons, he was using the tax-exempt status of Citizens United to acquire funds, urging his donors to fill out an [...] "emergency impeachment" [...] survey, utilizing a push-poll technique. Brown's fundraising literature said, [...] "Our top investigator, David Bossie, is on the inside directing the probe as Special Assistant to U.S. Senator Lauch Faircloth on the U.S. Senate Whitewater Committee." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first issue}} of Talk {{appeared}} in September 1999. The cover story of the debut issue was an interview with Hillary Clinton, which took place shortly after the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, in which she explained <b>that</b> her husband <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> a chronic need to please women. The Washington Post reported that at times, [...] "Talk seemed more interested in promoting such Miramax stars as Gwyneth Paltrow than in politics." [...] However, the magazine never became a commercial success, and was shut down on January 18, 2002. Politico.com estimated that Brown had [...] "bombed through some $50 million in 2 1/2 years" [...] on the failed venture. A $1 million contract settlement in 2002 ended Browns' involvement in Talk Media.|$|R
5000|$|McPeak was a {{co-chair}} of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. He generated controversy following comments he {{made at a}} campaign appearance in Medford, Oregon where he implied <b>that</b> former President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> appeared to question Obama's patriotism: [...] "As one who for 37 years proudly wore the uniform of our country, I'm saddened to see a president employ these tactics. He of all people should know better {{because he was the}} target of exactly the same kind of tactics." [...] McPeak also compared the former President's comments to McCarthyism: [...] "I grew up, I was going to college when Joe McCarthy was accusing good Americans of being traitors, so I've had enough of it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sheffield {{earned a}} B.A. in {{communications}} from Brigham Young University in 2005 and a master's degree {{in public policy}} from Harvard University. She formerly worked for syndicated columnist Robert Novak before receiving a journalism fellowship award from The Phillips Foundation on [...] "Latter-day Saints in the Policy Arena-The Political Influence and Climate of Modern Mormonism." [...] She later joined {{the editorial board of}} The Washington Times under Tony Blankley, writing on domestic and foreign policy and politics. She covered the 2008 presidential race, including an interview with former U.S. president Jimmy Carter at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, during which he stated <b>that</b> former president <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> damaged Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.|$|R
5000|$|In {{writing about}} the 1998 {{impeachment}} of <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton,</b> Morrison wrote <b>that,</b> since Whitewater, <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> been mistreated because of his [...] "Blackness": Years ago, {{in the middle of}} the Whitewater investigation, one heard the first murmurs: white skin notwithstanding, this is our first black President. Blacker than any actual black person who could ever be elected in our children's lifetime. After all, Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas. The phrase [...] "our first Black president" [...] was adopted as a positive by <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> supporters. When the Congressional Black Caucus honored the former president at its dinner in Washington D.C. on September 29, 2001, for instance, Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX), the chair, told the audience that Clinton [...] "took so many initiatives he made us think for a while we had elected the first black president." ...|$|R
