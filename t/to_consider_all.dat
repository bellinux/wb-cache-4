5|$|The {{design process}} {{involves}} trading-off different factors, including colour, contrast and overall disruptive effect. A failure <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>all</b> elements of pattern design tends {{to result in}} poor results. The US Army's Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), for example, adopted after limited testing in 2003–4, performed poorly because of low pattern contrast ("isoluminance"—beyond very close range, the design looks like a field of solid light grey, failing to disrupt an object's outlines) and arbitrary colour selection, neither {{of which could be}} saved by quantizing (digitizing) the pattern geometry. The design was replaced from 2015 with Operational Camouflage Pattern, a non-pixellated pattern.|$|E

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} bounded {{quantification}} {{is to allow}} for polymorphic functions to depend on some specific behaviour of objects instead of type inheritance. It assumes a record-based model for object classes, where every class member is a record element and all class members are named functions. Object attributes are represented as functions that take no argument and return an object. The specific behaviour is then some function name along with the types of the arguments and the return type. Bounded quantification allows <b>to</b> <b>considers</b> <b>all</b> objects with such a function. An example would be a polymorphic [...] function that <b>considers</b> <b>all</b> objects that are comparable to each other.|$|R
25|$|The {{advent of}} quantum {{mechanics}} in the early 20th century and the formulation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in 1927 saw the end to the Newtonian mindset among physicists regarding the determinacy of nature.

25|$|In April, Lord Rosmead {{resigned}} his posts of High Commissioner for Southern Africa and Governor of Cape Colony. The situation {{resulting from}} the Jameson raid {{was one of the}} greatest delicacy and difficulty, and Joseph Chamberlain, now colonial secretary, selected Milner as Lord Rosmead's successor. The choice was cordially approved by the leaders of the Liberal party and warmly recognized at a farewell dinner on 28 March 1897 presided over by the future prime minister Herbert Henry Asquith. The appointment was avowedly made in order that an acceptable British statesman, in whom public confidence was reposed, might go to South Africa <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>all</b> the circumstances and to formulate a policy which should combine the upholding of British interests with the attempt to deal justly with the Transvaal and Orange Free State governments.|$|E
25|$|On 8 May, Zagreb was liberated by the Partisan 1st and 2nd Army, with {{relatively}} few skirmishes and {{casualties in the}} city itself: the 1st Army reported to the General Staff that 10,901 enemy soldiers had been killed and 15,892 captured in taking Zagreb. That same day, {{the headquarters of the}} 51st Vojvodina Division of the Yugoslav 3rd Army issued a dispatch ordering its units <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>all</b> enemy officers and soldiers who continue resistance after midnight that day, and who are not part of units who had an organized surrender, as persons who do not have the status of prisoners of war, and to treat them as bandits. The German surrender obstructed the progress of the columns fleeing Croatia northwards. By 9 May, Partisan forces had moved into Maribor which eliminated that escape route. They also took control of Celje on 10 May, but with a force insufficient to halt the columns that were escaping towards Dravograd.|$|E
25|$|Often, {{people with}} dysthymia will seek out {{treatment}} not necessarily because of depressed mood, but rather due to increasing {{levels of stress}} or because of personal difficulties that may be situation-related. This is hypothesized to be because of the chronic nature of the disorder, and how depressed mood is often {{thought to be a}} characterological pattern for the individual with the condition. Thus, it is only when the person experiences increasing stress that he or she thinks to go to some sort of trained professional for symptom relief. It is usually through the administration of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV that dysthymia is first diagnosed. At this point, {{with the help of a}} trained professional, a certain line of treatment is often discussed and then selected. It is important <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>all</b> factors in the person's life that may be affected when deciding on a particular course of treatment. Additionally, if one method of treatment does not particularly work for a certain individual, it may be helpful to try something else.|$|E

25|$|Governor General the Viscount Monck had {{originally}} {{pushed for a}} distinct Canadian order of knighthood in 1867, {{to be called the}} Order of St. Lawrence. The idea was revived by Vincent Massey in 1935 and again in 1951, in between which he also suggested in 1940 a Royal Order of Canada. The Canadian Cabinet, however, never accepted these proposals, generally wishing instead to steer clear of the controversial topic of orders. Still, the beginnings of a distinct Canadian honours system came in March 1934, with the creation of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal by royal warrant of King George V, issued on the advice of the Cabinet of R. B. Bennett; {{this was the first time}} an honour specific to Canada and for service in Canada had been established by the monarch of Canada (as opposed to earlier campaign and service medals that had been issued to Canadians and British personnel alike by the British monarch). There was uncertainty amongst officials in Canada and Britain alike around how to go about creating such an honour, and delays were incurred not only as Canadian bureaucrats interpreted the Nickle Resolution as applying to medals, but also because the King himself was widening the project <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>all</b> the Commonwealth and Empire police forces.|$|E
25|$|An object {{outside the}} {{critical}} distance {{is unlikely to}} be struck by the leader if there is a solidly grounded object within the critical distance. Locations that are considered safe from lightning can be determined by imagining a leader's potential paths as a sphere that travels from the cloud to the ground. For lightning protection, it suffices <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>all</b> possible spheres as they touch potential strike points. To determine strike points, consider a sphere rolling over the terrain. At each point, a potential leader position is simulated. Lightning is most likely to strike where the sphere touches the ground. Points that the sphere cannot roll across and touch are safest from lightning. Lightning protectors should be placed where they will prevent the sphere from touching a structure. A weak point in most lightning diversion systems is in transporting the captured discharge from the lightning rod to the ground, though. Lightning rods are typically installed around the perimeter of flat roofs, or along the peaks of sloped roofs at intervals of 6.1 m or 7.6 m, depending on the height of the rod. When a flat roof has dimensions greater than 15m by 15m, additional air terminals will be installed {{in the middle of the}} roof at intervals of 15m or less in a rectangular grid pattern.|$|E

[...] While a defendant is not obliged to use peremptory challenges to cure a trial court's erroneous denial of a defendant's for-cause challenge, if the defendant does so, the defendant may not rely on the error for automatic reversal.|$|E

500|$|However, at this time, cladistics, which {{appeared}} in the 1950s, was starting to change scientists' approach to biological classification. Unlike previous methods, cladistics attempts <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>all</b> the characteristics of an organism, rather than those subjectively chosen as most important. As a result, it gives less significance to unique or bizarre characteristics than to those that are shared, since only the latter can demonstrate relationships. Cladistics also emphasises the concept of a monophyletic group, in other words one that consists only of a common ancestor and all its descendants– for example it regards the traditional term [...] "reptile" [...] as useless, since mammals and birds are descendants of different groups of [...] "reptiles", but are not considered [...] "reptiles". The concepts of crown groups and stem groups, first presented in English in 1979, are consequences of this approach. A crown group is a monophyletic group of living organisms, and a stem group is a non-monophyletic set of organisms that do not have all the shared features of the crown group but have enough to distinguish them clearly from close relatives of other crown groups– in very simple terms, they are [...] "evolutionary aunts" [...] of the organisms in the crown group. Phyla are crown groups, and {{the fact that some of}} their characteristics are considered defining features is simply a consequence of the fact that their ancestors survived while closely related lineages became extinct.|$|E
