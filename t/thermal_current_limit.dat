40|$|Two primary {{problems}} {{resulted from}} plasma interactions; one {{of concern to}} operations in geosynchronous orbit (GEO), the other in low orbits (LEO). The two problems are not the same. Spacecraft charging has become widely recognized as a problem, particularly for communications satellites operating in GEO. The very thin thermal plasmas at GEO are insufficient to bleed off voltage buildups due to higher energy charged particle radiation collected on outer surfaces. Resulting differential charging/discharging causes electrical transients, spurious command signals and possible direct overload damage. An extensive NASA/Air Force program has been underway for several years to address this problem. At lower altitudes, the denser plasmas of the plasmasphere/ionosphere provide sufficient <b>thermal</b> <b>current</b> to <b>limit</b> such charging to a few volts or less. Unfortunately, these <b>thermal</b> plasma <b>currents</b> which solve the GEO spacecraft charging problem can become large enough to cause just the opposite problem in LEO...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{switched-mode}} rectifier (SMR) allows automotive alternators {{to operate}} at a load-matched condition at all operating speeds, overcoming the limitation of optimum performance at just one speed. While use of an SMR and load matching control enables large improvements in output power at cruising speed, no extra power is obtained at idle. This document introduces a new SMR modulation strategy capable of improving alternator output power at idle speed without violating <b>thermal</b> or <b>current</b> <b>limits</b> of the alternator. The new modulation scheme may be implemented with simple control hardware, and {{without the use of}} expensive current or position sensors. After introducing the new modulation method, we develop approximate analytical models that establish the underlying basis for the approach. Implementation considerations are addressed, and both simulation and experimental results are provided that demonstrate the advantages of the proposed control method.

50|$|When the {{workload}} on the processor calls for faster performance, the processor's clock {{will try to}} increase the operating frequency in regular increments as required to meet demand. The increased clock rate {{is limited by the}} processor's power, <b>current,</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>limits,</b> the number of cores currently in use, and the maximum frequency of the active cores. Frequency increases occur in increments of 133 MHz for Nehalem processors and 100 MHz for Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell and Skylake processors. When any electrical or thermal limits are exceeded, the operating frequency automatically decreases in decrements of 133 or 100 MHz until the processor is again operating within its design limits. Turbo Boost 2.0 was introduced in 2011 with the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture, while Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 was introduced in 2016 with the Broadwell-E microarchitecture.|$|R
40|$|Increase in {{the demand}} and {{consumption}} of electrical energy has led to increase in the system fault levels. Superconducting Fault-current limiters (SFCL) offer ideal performance in electrical power system. Superconducting Fault Current Limiters (SFCLs) are used in power system network to mitigate the overcurrent and its prominent effects. Nowadays, Coated Conductors (CCs) are widely used for novel design of SFCL for such applications. The thermal and electrical behaviors of different configurations of SFCL {{in the presence of}} over-critical current are studied in detail to master its performance in a power grid. An algorithm to solve the differential equations characterizing the superconductingmaterial is developed using the Runge-Kutta method. In this report, comparative study on the operational characteristics of Resistive-SFCL based on BSSCO and YBCO Coated Conductors under fault condition is analyzed for an 110 KV/ 9 KA power system. Also Electro-thermal Model of Coated Conductor is implemented in MATLAB software. The developed models accurately predicted the current-time waveforms achievable with the limiters for an improved <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> behavior during fault condition and even the restraining the conditions upsetting the thermal stability of the SFCLs. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed Resistive-SFCL, several case studies of Coated Conductors have been carried out in MATLAB.

40|$|Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) {{techniques}} {{have been proposed}} to save on thermal packaging and cooling costs for generalpurpose processors. However, when invoked, these techniques result in a significant performance degradation. This paper concerns performance-effective DTM for multimedia applications. We make two contributions: (1) Current DTM algorithms are reactive in nature. We propose a predictive DTM algorithm targeted at multimedia applications, which allows the efficient use of response mechanisms that have high invocation overhead. We find that for our applications, our predictive algorithm performs significantly better than existing reactive DTM algorithms. (2) We {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} different DTM response mechanisms. Specifically, we demonstrate the importance of tailoring DTM response mechanisms to the thermal "hot-spots" on the chip and the <b>current</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>limit,</b> and show that a predictive combination of architecture adaptation and dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) performs the best across a broad range of applications and thermal limits...|$|R
50|$|A scheme {{patented}} in 2004 {{is intended}} for conversion of existing AC transmission lines to HVDC. Two of the three circuit conductors are operated as a bipole. The third conductor {{is used as a}} parallel monopole, equipped with reversing valves (or parallel valves connected in reverse polarity). The parallel monopole periodically relieves current from one pole or the other, switching polarity over a span of several minutes. The bipole conductors would be loaded to either 1.37 or 0.37 of their thermal limit, with the parallel monopole always carrying ±1 times its <b>thermal</b> <b>limit</b> <b>current.</b> The combined RMS heating effect is as if each of the conductors is always carrying 1.0 of its rated current. This allows heavier currents to be carried by the bipole conductors, and full use of the installed third conductor for energy transmission. High currents can be circulated through the line conductors even when load demand is low, for removal of ice.|$|R

Improvements include higher accuracy, tighter saturation control, better supply rejection, and enhanced RESET circuitry. Familiar PNP regulator features such as reverse battery protection, overvoltage shutdown, <b>thermal</b> shutdown, and <b>current</b> <b>limit</b> make the CS 8126 suitable for use in automotive and battery operated equipment. Additional on−chip filtering has been included to enhance rejection of high frequency transients on all external leads. An active microprocessor RESET function is included on−chip with externally programmable delay time. During power−up, or after detection of any error in the regulated output, the RESET lead {{will remain in the}} low state {{for the duration of the}} delay. Types of errors include short circuit, low input voltage, overvoltage shutdown, thermal shutdown, or others that cause the output to become unregulated. This function is independent of the input voltage and will function correctly with an output voltage as low as 1. 0 V. Hysteresis is included in both the reset and Delay comparators for enhanced noise immunity. A latching discharge circuit is used to discharge the Delay capacitor, even when triggered by a relatively short fault condition. This circuit improves upon the commonly used SCR structure by providing full capacitor discharge (0. 2 V type). Note: The CS 8126 is lead compatible with the LM 2927 and LM 2926. ...|$|R
