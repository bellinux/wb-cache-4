5|$|Every spring, the Institute holds a ceremony, {{known as}} When <b>the</b> <b>Whistle</b> Blows, to honor students, staff, and faculty who {{died during the}} {{previous}} year. The Georgia Tech Whistle is blown once for each person who died, and once more to salute Georgia Tech alumni and friends who may also have died. A procession of the military escort, led by the Ramblin' Wreck, leads up to the ceremony, during which the Wreck is parked next to the speaker's stage.|$|E
5|$|Steam Whistle – An {{industrial}} {{steam whistle}} has been present on Georgia Tech's campus {{ever since the}} early industrial shop years. It typically was blown for the change of classes at five minutes before the hour. On football game days, <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> is blown after every Yellow Jackets' score, and again after every Yellow Jackets' victory.|$|E
5|$|The New York Times {{was criticized}} for the 13-month delay of the December 2005 story {{revealing}} the U.S. National Security Agency warrantless surveillance program. Ex-NSA officials blew <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> on the program to journalists James Risen and Eric Lichtblau, who presented an investigative article to the newspaper in November 2004, weeks before America's presidential election. Contact with former agency officials began the previous summer.|$|E

5|$|As {{champions of}} the Football League, Burnley {{qualified}} for the Charity Shield, then known as the Dewar Shield. Burnley's opponents were Tottenham Hotspur, who had finished sixth in the First Division and beaten Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup final. In what was the last match of the 1920–21 campaign, Burnley fell to a 0–2 loss at White Hart Lane on 16May 1921. The match was not without controversy, as the Burnley players claimed that the second goal should have been disallowed despite the Tottenham goalscorer being onside, maintaining that <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> had already been blown by the referee.|$|E
5|$|As {{the game}} wears on, Shooter only deals, {{and then after}} another hand when Howard outplays them, two more players, Yeller and Sokal, drop out. That leaves just Howard and the Kid. After a few {{unlikely}} wins, the Kid calls for a break and confronts Shooter, who admits to being forced into cheating by Slade. The Kid insists he can win {{on his own and}} tells Shooter to deal straight or he will blow <b>the</b> <b>whistle,</b> destroying Shooter's reputation. Before the game resumes, Melba succeeds in seducing the Kid. Christian makes a surprise visit to the room, catches them after the fact and walks out on The Kid.|$|E
5|$|In the 37th minute, Bahr took a {{long shot}} from twenty-five yards out, but as Williams moved to his right to intercept, Gaetjens dived headlong near the penalty spot, and grazed the ball enough to {{put it to the}} left of the English goalkeeper, whose {{momentum}} prevented him from changing direction, and into the back of the net. The crowd exploded as the U.S. improbably led 1–0. As the half drew to a close, Finney had a chance to equalize, but <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> blew before he could shoot.|$|E

5|$|Schiavo {{resigned}} from her {{position at the}} U.S. Department of Transportation in order to blow <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> on what she saw as deficiencies in safety practices by the federal government's oversight of the airline industry. She was publicly critical of high-ranking U.S. aviation officials regarding the ValuJet Flight 592 passenger jet crash in the Florida Everglades {{which resulted in the}} deaths of all 110 people aboard. Schiavo appeared on ABC's Nightline program the night after the crash and was highly critical of FAA safety inspections methods. After resigning her position as Inspector General Schiavo taught courses at Ohio State University, and in April 1997 she joined the staff of Ohio State University in the position of Enarson Executive-in-Residence.|$|E
5|$|Watched by a near-capacity crowd, the {{visitors}} Arsenal began the tie more strongly, {{but failed to}} convert their chances. They took the lead minutes before half-time when Alan Smith scored from a Paul Merson cross. Wrexham's performance improved the longer the match went, and they equalised through Mickey Thomas's free kick in the 82nd minute. Two minutes later, the home side went ahead after Steve Watkin collected the ball from his teammate Gordon Davies and diverted it past goalkeeper David Seaman. A pitch invasion occurred once <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> blew for full-time; the Wrexham players and staff joined in celebrations with their supporters. Wrexham's reward was a fourth-round tie against West Ham United which they lost in a replay.|$|E
5|$|With half-time fast approaching, Barcelona's {{confidence}} {{began to}} show: first, Messi attempted to flick a {{pass over the}} top of the United defence to Thierry Henry, which Rio Ferdinand intercepted; Iniesta then tried an ambitious back-heel that Van der Sar collected; and finally Messi sped through three Manchester United defenders towards the by-line, only for his cut-back cross to be pounced upon by Van der Sar and then cleared by Vidić. On the stroke of half-time, Iniesta himself then attempted to flick the ball through to Henry, but it was just too high for the French striker, and referee Massimo Busacca took that cue to blow <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> for the interval.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> brown-winged <b>{{whistling}}</b> thrush (Myophonus castaneus), {{also known}} as <b>the</b> Sumatran <b>whistling</b> thrush or chestnut-winged whistling thrush, is a passerine bird belonging to <b>the</b> <b>whistling</b> thrush genus Myophonus in the family Muscicapidae. It is endemic to the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. In the past, {{it has often been}} lumped together with <b>the</b> Javan <b>whistling</b> thrush (M. glaucinus) and Bornean whistling thrush (M. borneensis) as <b>the</b> [...] "Sunda <b>whistling</b> thrush" [...] (M. glaucinus) but it is now often regarded as a separate species based on differences in plumage and measurements.|$|R

5|$|Ambitious {{reporter}} Amy Harkin (Nancy McKeon) {{is stuck}} {{reporting on the}} heat wave while trying to find proof behind the scenes that Lexer and Midwest {{are responsible for the}} lack of sufficient power. The Secretary of Energy, Shirley Abbott (Dianne Wiest), is actively warning various politicians and the president that the power grid is too outdated to handle real natural disasters and that it is too vulnerable to attack. Dan London (Ari Cohen), the chief engineer of Lexer, has also repeatedly warned Lexer that their systems are too vulnerable to hackers, but the company is only interested in going with the cheapest options. He decides to blow <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> on the company to Harkin, but as he refuses to appear on camera, Harkin's boss will not allow the piece to air.|$|E
5|$|Don't Look Now is {{particularly}} indebted to Alfred Hitchcock, exhibiting several {{characteristics of the}} director's work. The aural match cut following Christine's death from Laura's scream to the screech of a drill references a cut in The 39 Steps, when a woman's scream cuts to <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> of a steam train. When John reports Laura's disappearance to the Italian police he inadvertently becomes {{a suspect in the}} murder case they are investigating—an innocent man being wrongly accused and pursued by the authorities is a common Hitchcock trait. The film also takes a Hitchcockian approach to its mise en scène, by manifesting its protagonist's psychology in plot developments: in taking their trip to Venice the Baxters have run away from personal tragedy, and are often physically depicted as running to and from things during their stay in Venice; the labyrinthine geography of Venice causes John to lose his bearings, and he often becomes separated from Laura and is repeatedly shown to be looking for her—both physical realisations {{of what is going on}} in his head.|$|E
5|$|When Colorado state troops {{arrived in}} Cripple Creek {{early on the}} morning of June 6, more {{violence}} had already broken out. The deputies were exchanging gunfire with the miners on Bull Hill. Gen. Brooks quickly moved his troops from the train station to the foot of Bull Hill. As Sheriff Bowers and Gen. Brooks began to argue about what course of action to take next, the deputies took advantage of the lull and attempted to charge the miners. The miners sounded <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> at the Victor mine, alerting Gen. Brooks. Soldiers of the state militia quickly intercepted the deputies and stopped their advance. Brooks ordered his men to occupy the top of Bull Hill, and the miners offered no resistance.|$|E

5|$|With {{the score}} 1–0, Arsenal pushed forward but Liverpool still held the advantage. In the 74th minute an unmarked Thomas latched onto a pass from Richardson near the penalty spot, but shot weakly {{and it was}} smothered by Liverpool keeper Bruce Grobbelaar. Arsenal manager George Graham brought on Martin Hayes and Perry Groves, and {{switched}} to a more attack-oriented 4–4–2 formation. This gave Liverpool space to counter-attack through John Barnes and Aldridge. Aldridge and Ray Houghton both had late chances to equalise but did not capitalise on them; Houghton sliced a shot {{from the edge of}} the box wide, while Aldridge was caught offside meeting a Barnes throughball and scored a disallowed goal after <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> had gone. As full-time approached the game was heading for a 1–0 scoreline, and thus Liverpool would win the title.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>whistle</b> is tuned diatonically, {{which allows}} it {{to be used to}} easily play music in two major keys a perfect fourth apart and the natural minor key and Dorian mode a major second above the lowest note. <b>The</b> <b>whistle</b> is {{identified}} by its lowest note, which is the tonic of the lower of two major keys whose tonics are a perfect fourth apart that <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> most easily plays in. Note that this method of determining the key of the instrument is different from the method used to determine the key of a chromatic instrument, which is based on the relationship between notes on a score and sounded pitch. Whistles are available {{in a wide variety of}} different keys.|$|E
