5|$|During the Internet bubble <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>up</b> to 2000, heavy {{investments}} in undersea fibre-optic cables linked Asia {{with the rest}} of the world. The fall that followed the economic boom resulted in the auction of cheap fiber optic cables at one-tenth of their original price. This development resulted in widely available low-cost communications infrastructure. All of these investments and events, not to mention a swell of available talent, resulted in India becoming almost overnight the centre for outsourcing of Business process.

5|$|On December 4, 2011, {{the final}} Bowl Championship Series standings were {{unveiled}} with LSU ranked first, followed by Alabama, {{to set up}} a rematch between the two teams in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game. In the weeks <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>up</b> to the game, the notion of a split national championship became a major storyline. This was the case as the AP Poll is not tied to the Bowl Championship Series and some AP voters expressed they might vote LSU national champions even if they lost as they defeated Alabama in their regular season game. However, after Alabama shut out LSU 21–0 in the BCS National Championship Game, the AP voted them national champions to give the Crimson Tide the consensus national championship and thus avoid a split title with LSU.|$|E

5|$|Burnout 3: Takedown was {{developed}} by Guildford-based video game studio Criterion Games. The studio suffered several setbacks during {{the sequence of events}} <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>up</b> to the creation of Burnout 3, including the cancellation of a project, a failed pitch, and a fall out with the game's eventual publisher Electronic Arts (EA). In 2002, Criterion was around 130 people divided into two development teams. One team was working on Burnout 2: Point of Impact, a follow up to Burnout, set to be published by Acclaim Entertainment. The other team had completed the development of the extreme sports game AirBlade for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. Sony had intentions of continuing to collaborate with Criterion on a sequel to AirBlade, however the AirBlade team turned down the offer. Instead, Criterion began talks with EA, who had a proposal for Criterion to create a remake of the 1988 skateboarding video game Skate or Die!. Criterion were keen to work with EA and started development on the project. Following Burnout 2s release, Criterion prepared a pitch to EA Canada about working on a second game with the publisher. Criterion's proposed title was Need For Speed: Split Second, a stunt racing game within EA's Need for Speed series. Meanwhile, the Skate of Die! remake project was thrown into disarray when EA requested changes to the game's design and the creative direction of project shifted away from Criterion's vision. With development staff becoming unhappy and stressed about the project, the studio decided to contact EA and cancel the game. EA was displeased with their decision and {{the relationship between the two}} companies soured, leading to dissolution of the proposed Need for Speed game.|$|E
