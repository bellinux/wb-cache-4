25|$|That you say as {{a theologian}} that I am a universalist is evident, in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> believe that Jesus was sent {{into the world}} to save the sinners that we all are. This is what I {{understand}} Saint Paul to say when he mentions that sin has entered the world through one man, Adam, and spread to all men, and that he calls Jesus the second Adam through Whom redemption entered the world for all men, and even as he says 'all of creation,' that the redemption of Christ is the victory of God over the Fall. I believe that this great plan of salvation is universal, concerns not only all men but the universality {{of the world and}} that Jesus on the Cross has accomplished this Salvation, this reconciliation of men with God, that the 'chastisement' as Isaiah says is fallen upon Him to free men from the malediction of the Fall. This plan of God therefore seems to be collective, global, universal.|$|E

His biggest success as a child actor was as the star of the PBS children's series The Voyage of the Mimi (1984) and The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988), produced for sixth-grade science classes. Affleck worked [...] "sporadically" [...] on Mimi from the age of eight to fifteen in both Massachusetts and Mexico.

Turner conceded that Steffy was a better game-planner during practices. Head coach Ralph Friedgen who had offered critical or subdued assessments of Turners' practice, said his intensity grew after losing the starting position to Steffy prior to the 2008 season.

I suggest substantial modifications to Keeley’s account which would both solve the problem cases and make better <b>sense</b> of <b>the</b> actual classifications made by scientists.

Though all of the main line of Ultima games are arranged into trilogies, Richard Garriot later revealed that Ultima VII was the first game where he did any sort of planning ahead for future games in the series. He elaborated that [...] "the first three didn't {{have much to do}} with each other, they were 'Richard Garriott learns to program'; IV through VI were a backwards-designed trilogy, in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> tied them together as I wrote them; but VII-IX, the story of the Guardian, were a preplanned trilogy, and we had a definite idea of where we wanted to go." [...] An expansion pack was released named Forge of Virtue that added a newly arisen volcanic island to the map that the Avatar was invited to investigate. The tie-in storyline was limited to this island, where a piece of Exodus (his data storage unit) had resurfaced. To leave the island again, the Avatar had to destroy this remnant of Exodus. In the process of doing so, he also created The Black Sword, an immensely powerful weapon possessed by a demon.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to Dr. A. K. Md. Ehsanes Saleh, in celebration of his distinguished accomplishments and contributions to statistical science, especially nonparametric methods. We explore relationships between the finite-sample addition breakdown point (ABP) and replacement breakdown point (RBP) of a statistic. Each concerns the minimum fraction of contaminants present in a sample, due to either addition or replacement, that can cause breakdown. Some authors prefer the ABP, which avoids the need to specify points to replace. Others argue {{the merits of the}} RBP, which avoids the conceptual issue of adding further points to the actual data. Zuo (2001) provides quantitative correspondences between the ABP and RBP when they depend only on the sample size and assume a particular form. In the present note we pursue their relationship in full generality, allowing dependence on data values and not restricting to any special form, thus including for example the Hodges-Lehmann location estimator and the sample halfspace median. We develop inequalities showing that the ABP and RBP are equivalent in <b>the</b> <b>senses</b> <b>that</b> (<b>i)</b> each corresponds to the other, through explicit expressions or by inequalities, although their values can slightly differ, and (ii) asymptotic limits, whether deterministi...|$|R
