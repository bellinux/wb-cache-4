5|$|John Sidney McCain III (born August 29, 1936) is an American {{politician}} who currently {{serves as the}} senior United States Senator from Arizona, in that office since 1987.

5|$|Another {{controversial}} Peace Prize {{was that}} awarded <b>to</b> <b>Barack</b> <b>Obama</b> in 2009. Nominations had closed only eleven days after Obama took office as President of the United States, {{but the actual}} evaluation occurred over the next eight months. Obama himself stated {{that he did not}} feel deserving of the award, or worthy of the company it would place him in. Past Peace Prize laureates were divided, some saying that Obama deserved the award, and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award, along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore, also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias.|$|E

5|$|As First Lady of the United States, Clinton was an {{advocate}} for gender equality and healthcare reform. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led to her issuing a statement reaffirming her commitment to the marriage. In 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female Senator from New York. She was re-elected to the Senate in 2006. Running for president in 2008, she won far more delegates than any previous female candidate, but lost the Democratic nomination <b>to</b> <b>Barack</b> <b>Obama.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{tried to}} follow in the pattern of New Englanders who have entered the race for the Democratic {{nomination}} and won, including John Kerry, Michael Dukakis, and John F. Kennedy. If elected, Dodd would have become the second Roman Catholic president (after Kennedy) and the second Connecticut-born president (after George W. Bush). He would have been the first Senator to win the presidency while in office since Kennedy was elected in 1960 (that honor ultimately went <b>to</b> <b>Barack</b> <b>Obama).</b> After his withdrawal from the race, Dodd went on to endorse the eventual winner Barack Obama, and retired from the Senate in 2011.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, she {{attended}} the national funeral service for Gerald Ford in the Washington National Cathedral. Reagan hosted two 2008 Republican presidential debates at the Reagan Presidential Library, {{the first in}} May 2007 and the second in January 2008. While she {{did not participate in}} the discussions, she sat in the front row and listened as the men vying to become the nation's 44th president claimed to be a rightful successor to her husband. Though some speculation arose as to whether Reagan might support New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in a presidential bid, nothing came of it. On March 25, she formally endorsed Senator John McCain, then the presumptive Republican party nominee for president, but McCain would go on to lose the election <b>to</b> <b>Barack</b> <b>Obama.</b>|$|E

5|$|There {{were four}} Saxbe fixes for appointees of presidents prior <b>to</b> <b>Barack</b> <b>Obama.</b> The first two rollbacks {{concerned}} appointees of Republicans William Howard Taft and Richard Nixon, {{and the last}} two were implemented for appointees of Democrats Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. Congress approved two more in the weeks preceding Obama's presidency in preparation for his designated Cabinet nominees. Since the 1980s, Saxbe fixes have only been temporary, extending to {{the conclusion of the}} term for which the sitting member of Congress was elected. The Clause has received relatively little scholarly or judicial attention; the sparse extant debate centers on whether the reduction of salary satisfies the Ineligibility Clause, or whether affected members of Congress are ineligible for appointment in spite of the reduction.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} living former First Ladies: Rosalynn Carter, married to Jimmy Carter; Barbara Bush, married to George H. W.

Presidents John Tyler and Woodrow Wilson had two {{official}} First Ladies; both remarried during their presidential tenures. The wives of four Presidents died before their husbands were sworn into office {{but are still}} considered First Ladies by the White House and National First Ladies' Library: Martha Wayles Skelton, married to Thomas Jefferson; Rachel Jackson, married to Andrew Jackson; Hannah Van Buren, married to Martin Van Buren; and Ellen Lewis Herndon Arthur, married to Chester A. Arthur. One woman who was not married to a President is still considered an official First Lady: Harriet Lane, niece of bachelor James Buchanan. The other non-spousal relatives who served as White House hostesses are not recognized by the First Ladies' Library.|$|E

25|$|Amnesty International {{monitored}} the trial for fairness. In a letter <b>to</b> <b>Barack</b> <b>Obama,</b> four British Parliamentarians (Lord Ahmed, Lord Sheikh, Lord Patel, and MP Mohammad Sarwar), protested the arrest, {{calling it a}} violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Many of Siddiqui's supporters, including some international human rights organisations, claimed that Siddiqui was not an extremist and that she and her young children were illegally detained, interrogated, and tortured by Pakistani intelligence, US authorities, or both, during her five-year disappearance. The US and Pakistan governments have denied all such claims.|$|E
25|$|While the 2008 Iowa Caucuses saw {{a record}} turnout for both parties, the Democratic caucus drew more than 239,000 voters, {{almost double the}} Republican total. Entrance polling {{indicated}} that {{a significant portion of}} the turnout came from first-time caucus attendees, as well as attendees under the age of 30; two groups of voters that primarily lent their support <b>to</b> <b>Barack</b> <b>Obama.</b> Women, previously expected to largely back Hillary Clinton, split their vote between Clinton and Obama, the latter of whom actually received slightly more support. In the aftermath of the results from the Iowa Caucuses, Chris Dodd and Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race.|$|E
