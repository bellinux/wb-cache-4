5|$|Exmoor {{was one of}} {{the first}} British National Parks, {{designated}} in 1954, under the 1949 National Parks and Access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Countryside</b> Act. and is named after its main river. It was expanded in 1991 and in 1993 Exmoor was designated as an Environmentally Sensitive Area. The Quantock Hills were designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) in 1956, the first such designation in England under the National Parks and Access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Countryside</b> Act 1949.

5|$|From autumn 1943 the Japanese {{government}} took further steps {{to prepare the}} country's major cities for air attacks. An air defense general headquarters was established in November and a program of demolishing large numbers of buildings in major cities to create firebreaks began the next month. By {{the end of the}} war 614,000 housing units had been destroyed to clear firebreaks; these accounted for a fifth of all housing losses in Japan during the war and displaced 3.5 million people. The government also encouraged old people, children and women in cities that were believed likely to be attacked to move <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> from December 1943, and a program of evacuating entire classes of schoolchildren was implemented. By August 1944, 330,000 schoolchildren had been evacuated in school groups and another 459,000 had moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> with their family. Little was done to disperse industrial facilities to make them less vulnerable to attack, however, as this was logistically difficult.|$|E
5|$|Alvear ordered Saavedra to move {{immediately}} to Buenos Aires, {{to close the}} case. He arrived to the city in time, and Alvear was sympathetic to his situation. However, Alvear {{was forced to resign}} a few days later, before being able to rule the case. The Buenos Aires Cabildo, the interim government, restored Saavedra's military rank and honours, but the rule was abolished by Ignacio Álvarez Thomas, the following supreme director. He moved then <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside,</b> to live with his brother Luis. He kept requesting to the government the restoration of his rank.|$|E
5|$|As the {{political}} winds of the Cultural Revolution shifted, Bo and his siblings were either imprisoned or sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside,</b> and Bo Xilai {{was locked up}} for five years.

5|$|As their landscapes {{have similar}} scenic qualities, AONBs may be {{compared}} to the national parks of England and Wales. AONBs are created under the same legislation as the national parks, the National Parks and Access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Countryside</b> Act 1949. In contrast to national parks, which have their own authorities and legal power to prevent unsympathetic development, very few statutory duties are imposed on the local authorities within an AONB. However, further regulation and protection of AONBs was added by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.|$|E
5|$|In September and October 1945 Europeans and pro-Dutch Eurasians were {{attacked}} {{and killed by}} Indonesian mobs. Ferocious fighting erupted when 6,000 British Indian troops landed in the city. Sukarno and Hatta negotiated a ceasefire between the Republicans and the British forces led by Brigadier Mallaby. Following the killing of Mallaby on 30 October, the British sent more troops into the city from 10 November {{under the cover of}} air attacks. Although the European forces largely captured the city in three days, the poorly armed Republicans fought on until 29 November and thousands died as the population fled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} debate, Kennedy asked Phillips {{what would happen}} if Nhu responded to the cuts by {{diverting}} money away from the army to prop up his personal schemes. When Kennedy asked if Nhu would blame the US for any resulting military deterioration, Phillips replied that the ARVN would revolt, because the ARVN officers who were on Viet Cong hit lists would not allow the communists to run loose. Phillips said that if Nhu tried to divert military aid away from the troops to prop up his personal schemes, the Americans could deliver the money straight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> in suitcases.|$|E

5|$|James was a known philanderer {{who kept}} many mistresses, for which Anne often reproached him, once even {{complaining}} to the king, who sent one of James' mistresses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside,</b> where she remained until her death.

This was through Anne's influence; she {{had been exposed to}} Catholicism during visits to the Netherlands and France and was strongly attracted thereto.

5|$|Local Nature Reserves (LNRs) are {{designated}} by local authorities under the National Parks and Access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Countryside</b> Act 1949.

5|$|The National Park, 71% {{of which}} is in Somerset and 29% in Devon, has a {{resident}} population of 10,600.

Notice of the intention to create the AONB under The Quantock Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (Designation) Order, 1956 {{was published in the}} London Gazette on 7 February 1956. Since responsibility for the Quantock AONB is shared between the County Council and three District Councils The Quantock Hills Joint Advisory Committee was set up in 1973 and is responsible for drawing up management plans for the Quantocks.|$|E
