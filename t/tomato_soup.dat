5|$|Brian, {{the family}} dog, asks Kevin {{to explain why}} he deserted the army, with Kevin telling him that he had grown tired of the war, and had befriended many of the Iraqis, leading him to want to try to escape. Kevin and the family then begin {{fighting}} over the United States's occupation of Iraq, with Brian sympathizing with him, and several others, including Quagmire's Dad, a war veteran, disagreeing with Kevin's choice to desert the army.

2500|$|The main meal {{might be}} eaten about 2p.m. or later. It {{is larger than}} the North American lunch.

40|$|Fat {{and salt}} {{are a common}} and {{attractive}} combination in food and overconsumption of either is associated with negative health outcomes. The major aim was to investigate contributions and interactions of salt and fat on taste pleasantness and perception. The minor aim was to investigate individual fat taste sensitivity (detection threshold of oleic acid [C 18 : 1]) on pleasantness for fat. In a complete factorial design, 49 participants (18 - 54 years, 12 males) tasted <b>tomato</b> <b>soups</b> with 4 different fat concentrations (0 - 20 %) and 5 different salt concentrations (0. 04 - 2. 0 %). The preferred concentration and the discrimination ability for both fat and salt were determined by ranking tests. Results show that salt and fat affected pleasantness separately (P &lt; 0. 01), with salt having the strongest effect. Fat concentrations 0 %, 5 %, and 10 % {{did not differ in}} pleasantness, whereas 20 % was less pleasant (P &lt; 0. 05). There were no interactions for fat and salt on pleasantness or saltiness and fattiness intensity. Fat taste sensitive participants preferred lower fat concentrations than less sensitive participants (P = 0. 008). In conclusion, the strong effect of salt on pleasantness in this study suggests that salt, rather than fat, {{play a major role in}} the attraction to savory fatty foods...|$|R

She was quickly rescued from her temporary refugee accommodation, having met an old English friend who had an [...] "absurdly grandiose" [...] flat in the city and invited her to keep house for him. She and Gibson-Cowan amicably went their separate ways, and she moved into the grand flat. She engaged a cook, Kyriacou, a Greek refugee, whose eccentricities (sketched in a chapter of Is There a Nutmeg in the House?) did not prevent him from producing magnificent food: [...] "The flavour of that octopus stew, the rich wine dark sauce and the aroma of mountain herbs was something not easily forgotten."

Tom created some fun by sticking some stalks of celery in the big center bouquet on the sly and then asking Dora what sort of flowers she had ordered mixed in. And Nellie told Dick he ought to make a speech and he said he'd leave that to Tom, whereupon the irrepressible Tom said he would deliver a lecture on 'How to Cook for Two Alone' if Dick and Dora wanted to listen.

40|$|This model investigates {{particularly}} {{the impact of}} an integral and a non-integral number of waves on the swallowing of food stuff such as jelly, <b>tomato</b> puree, <b>soup,</b> concentrated fruits juices and honey transported peristaltically through the oesophagus. The fluid is considered as a Casson fluid. Emphasis is {{on the study of}} the dependence of local pressure distribution on space and time. Mechanical efficiency, reflux limit and trapping are also discussed. The effect of Casson fluid vis-à-vis Newtonian fluid is investigated analytically and numerically too. The result is physically interpreted as that the oesophagus makes more efforts to swallow fluids with higher concentration. It is observed that the pressure is uniformly distributed when an integral number of waves is there in the oesophagus; but it is non-uniform when a non-integral number of waves is present therein. It is further observed that as the plug flow region widens, the pressure difference increases, which indicates that the averaged flow rate will reduce for a Casson fluid. It is also concluded that Casson fluids are more prone to reflux...|$|R
