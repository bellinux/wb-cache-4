Farmers can purchase seedlings, <b>the</b> <b>lifeblood</b> <b>of</b> a Christmas tree farm, from nurseries. One farmer in Oregon purchased seedlings for between US$200–300 per 1,000plants.

25|$|Thus, {{both the}} Japanese and the Portuguese were {{left out of}} the {{tributary}} trade by {{the first decades of the}} 16th century. By the middle of the century though, Japan and Portugal became the premier suppliers of silver in East Asia by bringing in silver from mines like the Iwami Ginzan in Japan and the Cerro de Potosí in Bolivia. Silver was <b>the</b> <b>lifeblood</b> <b>of</b> the Ming Chinese economy, but the Ming government placed many restrictions on mining due to fears that the bullion would pool into private hands. Even without the restrictions, China's silver veins were too small and located too far away in the southwest from the commercialized coastal provinces to keep up with the huge demand. This situation made unofficial dealings with foreigners very profitable and enticing for Chinese merchants, despite the risks and illegality of their trade.|$|E

25|$|Columbia {{received}} its first charter as {{a town in}} 1805. An intendant and six wardens would govern the town. John Taylor, the first elected intendant, later served {{in both houses of}} the General Assembly, both houses of Congress, and eventually as governor. By 1816, there were 250 homes in the town and a population of more than one thousand. Columbia became chartered as a city in 1854, with an elected mayor and six aldermen. Two years later, Columbia had a police force consisting of a full-time chief and nine patrolmen. The city continued to grow at a rapid pace, and throughout the 1850s and 1860s Columbia was the largest inland city in the Carolinas. Railroad transportation served as a significant cause of population expansion in Columbia during this time. Rail lines that reached the city in the 1840s primarily transported cotton bales, not passengers. Cotton was <b>the</b> <b>lifeblood</b> <b>of</b> the Columbia community; in 1850 virtually all of the city's commercial and economic activity was related to cotton.|$|E

[...] Matthews regularly condemned the [...] "blazer brigade" [...] at the FA in his autobiography, slating them as [...] "conservative" [...] and stressing {{that many of them}} were Old Etonians; in his view they treated players and supporters poorly, demonstrated arrogance by ignoring competitions they did not control (the World Cup and European domestic competitions), and viewed innovations with excessive suspicion (for example the FA sanctioned only the use of floodlights in 1952 despite artificial lighting having been experimented with as far back as 1878, and for years insisted on using outdated kit such as heavy [...] "reinforced" [...] boots). Writing {{about the fact that the}} FA allocated only 12,000 of the 100,000 available tickets for the 1953 FA Cup Final to Blackpool supporters, Matthews wrote: [...] "I couldn't make my mind up whether they were dunderheads or simply didn't care about the genuine supporters who were <b>the</b> <b>lifeblood</b> <b>of</b> the game".|$|E

500|$|In South Slavic folklore, {{a vampire}} was {{believed}} to pass through several distinct stages in its development. The first 40 days were considered decisive for {{the making of a}} vampire; it started out as an invisible shadow and then gradually gained strength from <b>the</b> <b>lifeblood</b> <b>of</b> the living, forming a (typically invisible) jelly-like, boneless mass, and eventually building up a human-like body nearly identical to the one the person had had in life. This development allowed the creature to ultimately leave its grave and begin a new life as a human. The vampire, who was usually male, was also sexually active and could have children, either with his widow or a new wife. These could become vampires themselves, but could also have a special ability to see and kill vampires, allowing them to become vampire hunters.The same talent {{was believed to}} be found in persons born on Saturday. In the Dalmatian region of Croatia, there is a female vampire called a Mora or Morana, who drinks the blood of men, and also the kuzlac/kozlak who are the recent-dead [...] "who have not lived piously." [...] They can be men or women who show themselves at crossroads, bridges, caves, and graveyards and frighten the locals by terrorizing their homes and drinking their blood. To be killed, a wooden stake must be thrust through them. In Croatia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, a type of vampire called pijavica, which literally translates to [...] "leech", is used to describe a vampire who has led an evil and sinful life as a human and in turn, becomes a powerfully strong, cold-blooded killer. Incest, especially between mother and son, is one {{of the ways in which}} a pijavica can be created, and then it usually comes back to victimize its former family, who can only protect their homes by placing mashed garlic and wine at their windows and thresholds to keep it from entering. It can only be killed by fire while awake and by using the Rite of Exorcism if found in its grave during the day. In Bulgaria from the Middle Ages through to the beginning of the 20th century, it was a common practice to pin corpses through the heart with an iron stake to prevent their return as a vampire.|$|E
