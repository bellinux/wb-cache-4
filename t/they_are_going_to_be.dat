25|$|Specific trap {{sites for}} heavy mineral sand placer {{deposits}} are in beaches on the leeward side of headlands, as this forms a low-energy zone which traps sediments carried {{along by the}} longshore drift. Also, sand bars developed at the mouths of rivers which feed the placer deposits are rich trap sites where the winnowing action of the waves are most efficient, because heavy minerals, if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too heavy to be moved, will deposit at an isthmus in preference to drifting too far down the beach.|$|E
25|$|Imagine {{a pair of}} {{particles}} that can be measured at distant locations. Suppose that the measurement devices have settings, which are angles—e.g., the devices measure something called spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated—in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (How else could particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) {{can be thought of}} as telling us what the same measurement on particle 1 would have given.|$|E
25|$|As aforementioned, genba is agreeably one of {{the most}} {{prominent}} and core place for hip hop in Japan, there is however a visible shift and spread/increase of Japanese hip hop venues. Among these are clubs, crowds on streets and many more. According to Ian Condry, in his book he outlines the idea and fact that, clubs have become {{one of the}} most convenient and top promoting places for Japanese hip hop. Great Djs and turntable-lists use clubs to as venues to not promote other rappers, by that spreading the hip-hop culture, bring and promote new songs and their own hip hop work. Referring to some sources such as, the above named source is a Japanese hip hop forum that also focuses on clubs in Japan. The above source also services proof of Dj and upcoming artists naming places, clubs, Street gatherings of where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so as to promote their work or any artist they are interested in. The above all in all justifies the view that Japanese Hip hop venues are not just genba but have rather taken and shift or taking a shift into a variety of places such as the ones named above.|$|E

[...] David Brooks, in The New York Times, criticized what he saw as the [...] "White Messiah complex" [...] in the film, whereby the Na'vi [...] "can either have their history shaped by cruel imperialists or benevolent ones, but either way, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> supporting actors in our journey to self-admiration."

500|$|In November 2002, NCMP Steve Chia {{supported}} a motion by the Minister for Education stating that [...] "this House ...

[...] He suggested {{that there should be}} a focus on [...] "creative spontaneity", expressing the view that the education system in 2002 was one that focused on churning out a production line of workers, managers and instruction takers. Given that Singapore had reached the standards of a First World economy, Singapore should focus on instilling an inquisitive spirit within students, to encourage students to ask questions. He placed most emphasis on the importance of ensuring that the focus of education should be character building, stating: [...] "It will be failure of our education system if we are to train our best and brightest with our best resources only to be told that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the quitters of our society; or that they lack the compassion for the weak and the down; or that they behave in a snobbish class of their own; or behave condescendingly to their peers and followers; or that the elites only care about their own self-interests." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{few months}} after the {{publication}} of Newton's article, Lerone Bennett responded with an essay on the film in Ebony, titled [...] "The Emancipation Orgasm: Sweetback in Wonderland," [...] in which he discussed the film's [...] "black aesthetic". Bennett argued that the film romanticized the poverty and misery of the ghetto and that [...] "some men foolishly identify the black aesthetic with empty bellies and big bottomed prostitutes." [...] Bennett concluded that the film is [...] "neither revolutionary nor black because it presents the spectator with sterile daydreams and a superhero who is ahistorical, selfishly individualist with no revolutionary program, who acts out of panic and desperation." [...] Bennett described Sweetback's sexual initiation at ten years old as the [...] "rape of a child by a 40-year-old prostitute." [...] Bennett described instances when Sweetback saved himself through the use of his sexual prowess as [...] "emancipation orgasms" [...] and stated that [...] "it is necessary to say frankly that nobody ever fucked his way to freedom. And it is mischievous and reactionary finally for anyone to suggest to black people in 1971 that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to screw their way across the Red Sea.

2500|$|According to Loeb U.S. {{citizens}} are exempted from detention by subsection 1021(e) of the NDAA., but Judge Lohier expressed skepticism by saying [...] that the subsection [...] "doesn't exempt anything" [...] since it claimed {{not to change}} the law.
