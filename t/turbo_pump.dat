40|$|Abstracts: The {{research}} investigates {{two kinds}} basic problems during the precision processing about <b>turbo</b> molecular <b>pump</b> rotor using 5 -axis machining center. The {{one is to}} study the geometric and dimensional precision of <b>turbo</b> molecular <b>pump</b> rotor. The other one is to study the accuracy evaluative factors of 5 -axis <b>turbo</b> molecular <b>pump</b> rotor machining center. For improving the processing precision to ensure the dynamic symmetry and geometric symmetry of the <b>turbo</b> molecular <b>pump</b> rotor, it focus on analyzing the allowable deviations from the <b>turbo</b> molecular <b>pump</b> rotor’s nominal geometry and dimensions specified during the design stage by defining tolerances on the part’s features using geometric dimensioning tolerancing standards and homogeneous transformation matrix.

50|$|NASA have {{developed}} a Low cost rocket fuel pump which has comparable performance to turbopump at 80-90% lower cost. Perhaps the most difficult barrier to entry in the liquid rocket business is the <b>turbo</b> <b>pump.</b> A <b>turbo</b> <b>pump</b> design requires a large engineering effort and is expensive to manufacture and test. Starting a <b>turbo</b> <b>pump</b> fed rocket engine is a complex process, requiring a careful synchronisation of many valves and subsystems. In fact, Beal aerospace tried to avoid the issue entirely by building a huge pressure feed booster. Their booster never flew, but the engineering behind it was sound and, {{if they had a}} low cost pump at their disposal, they might be competing against Boeing. This pump saves up to 90% of the mass of the tanks as compared to a pressure fed system. This pump has really proved to be a boon for rockets. By using this pump the rocket does not have to carry such a heavy load and can travel with very high speed.|$|E

40|$|This study applies testing {{apparatus}} and a computational approach {{to examine a}} newly designed spiral-grooved <b>turbo</b> booster <b>pump</b> (TBP), which has both volume type and momentum transfer type vacuum pump functions, and is capable of operating at optimum discharge under pressures from approximately 1000 Pa to a high vacuum. Transitional flow pumping speed is increased by a well-designed connecting element. Pumping performance is predicted and examined via two computational approaches, namely the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method and the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. In CFD analysis, comparisons of measured and calculated inlet pressure in the slip and continuum flow demonstrate {{the accuracy of the}} calculation. Meanwhile, in transition flow, the continuum model of CFD is unsuitable for calculating such rarefied gas. The pumping characteristics for a full 3 D model on a rotating frame in transition and molecular regimes thus are simulated using the DSMC method and then confirmed experimentally. However, when the Knudsen number is in the range 0. 5 < Kn < 0. 1, neither CFD computation nor DSMC simulation is suitable for analyzing the pumping speed of the <b>turbo</b> booster <b>pump.</b> In this situation, the experimental approach is the most appropriate and effective method for analyzing pumping speed. Moreover, the developed pump is tested using assessment systems constructed according to ISO and JVIS- 005 standards, respectively. Comparisons are also made with other <b>turbo</b> <b>pumps.</b> The compared results show that the <b>turbo</b> booster <b>pump</b> presented here has good foreline performance...|$|R
50|$|Primary {{innovation}} was as {{the first}} to incorporate its <b>turbo</b> <b>pump</b> turbine upstream of its combustion chamber. Described then as low loss.Technological innovation embraced the Barske high-speed open-impeller centrifugal pumps, as formerly researched in the Walter organisation, regenerative cooling with pump stages both upstream and downstream, gauze catalyst packs, low-loss internal-flow turbine {{and the use of}} straight kerosene fuel. The aircraft tanks were to be pressurised to suppress pump cavitation problems.|$|E
50|$|The J-2X was {{intended}} {{to be based on the}} J-2 used on the S-II and S-IVB stages of the Saturn rockets used during the Apollo program, but as required thrust for the Ares I increased due to weight problems it became a clean sheet design. It entered development in 2007 as part of the cancelled Constellation program. Originally planned for use on the upper stages of the Ares I and Ares V rockets, the J-2X was later intended for use in the Earth Departure Stage of the Block II Space Launch System, the successor to the Constellation program. The engine is intended to be more efficient and simpler to build than its J-2 ancestor, and cost less than the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine. Differences in the new engine include the removal of beryllium, a centrifugal <b>turbo</b> <b>pump</b> versus the axial <b>turbo</b> <b>pump</b> of the J-2, different chamber and nozzle expansion ratios, a channel-walled combustion chamber versus the tube-welded chamber of the J-2, a redesign of all the electronics, a gas generator and supersonic main injector based on the RS-68, and the use of 21st-century joining techniques.|$|E
50|$|Fuel {{injection}} {{and management}} is also potentially complex. One possibility {{would be that}} the fuel be pressurized to 100 bar by a <b>turbo</b> <b>pump,</b> heated by the fuselage, sent through the turbine and accelerated to higher speeds than the air by a nozzle. The air and fuel stream are crossed in a comb like structure, which generates a large interface. Turbulence due to the higher speed of the fuel leads to additional mixing. Complex fuels like kerosene need a long engine to complete combustion.|$|E
50|$|This {{engine was}} {{initially}} slated for completion and testing by 2015. ISRO crossed a major milestone {{in the development}} of CE-20 engine with the successful 640 secs hot test at ISRO Propulsion Complex, Mahendragiri on 19 February 2017. The test demonstrated the repeatability of the engine performance with all its sub systems like thrust chamber, gas generator, <b>turbo</b> <b>pumps</b> and control components for the full duration. All the engine parameters were closely matching with the pre-test prediction.|$|R
50|$|The duct {{separated}} the fuel from the chamber wall and allowed controlled cooling {{of the chamber}} to keep {{the temperature of the}} kerosene down. This approach simplified the engine in comparison with competing designs. By eliminating the regenerative cooling circuit, many large manifolds and associated plumbing were eliminated as well, reducing potential failure modes and improving engine reliability. The TR107 engine used oxygen-rich combustion (ORSC) products to alleviate soot build-up when running the <b>turbo</b> <b>pumps.</b> The goal of the development was to produce a large, low-cost, easy-to-manufacture booster engine.|$|R

50|$|Much {{of recent}} <b>turbo</b> <b>pump</b> {{development}} {{has been focused on}} improvement of the effectiveness of the drag stages. As gas is removed from a pumped space, the lighter gases hydrogen and helium become a larger proportion of the remaining gas load. In recent years it has been demonstrated that the precise design of the surface geometry of the drag stages can have a marked effect on pumping of these light gases, improving compression ratios by up to two orders of magnitude for given pumping volume. As a result, it is possible to use much smaller backing pumps than would be required by pure turbomolecular pumps and/or design more compact turbomolecular pumps.|$|E
50|$|Several {{types of}} pumps {{may be used}} in {{sequence}} or in parallel. In a typical pumpdown sequence, a positive displacement pump would be used to remove most of the gas from a chamber, starting from atmosphere (760 Torr, 101 kPa) to 25 Torr (3 kPa). Then a sorption pump would be used to bring the pressure down to 10−4 Torr (10 mPa). A cryopump or turbomolecular pump would be used to bring the pressure further down to 10−8 Torr (1 µPa). An additional ion pump can be started below 10−6 Torr to remove gases which are not adequately handled by a cryopump or <b>turbo</b> <b>pump,</b> such as helium or hydrogen.|$|E
50|$|The rocket's {{first and}} second stages {{performed}} normally, {{and at the time}} controllers reported that third stage ignition had occurred. However, shortly afterwards the rocket began to under-perform, tumbling out of control, and deviating from its planned trajectory. Around 300 seconds into the flight, contact with the rocket was lost. Initial analysis of the data suggested that the vernier thrusters, used to provide attitude control, had failed to ignite due to engineering problems. On 17 April, ISRO announced that further analysis of the data indicated that the third stage main engine had not ignited either. According to ISRO, mission failed after the fuel <b>turbo</b> <b>pump</b> that supplied fuel to the cryogenic engine had stopped working a second after ignition.|$|E

50|$|The R-12 is a {{single-stage}} rocket with a separable single reentry vehicle.

The propulsion system consists of four liquid propellant rocket motors with a common <b>turbo</b> <b>pump</b> unit. The flight control was carried out {{with the help of}} four carbon jet vanes, located in the nozzles of the rocket motors.

The first flight attempt took place in April 2010 during the GSLV Mk.II D3/GSAT-3 mission. The engine ignited, but the ignition did not sustain as the Fuel Booster <b>Turbo</b> <b>Pump</b> (FBTP) shut down after reaching a speed of about 34,500 rpm 480 milliseconds after ignition, due to the FBTP being starved of Liquid Hydrogen (LH2). On 27th March 2013 the engine was successfully tested under vacuum conditions. The engine performed as expected and was qualified to power the third stage of the GSLV Mk-2 rocket. On 5 January 2014 the cryogenic engine performed successfully and launched the GSAT-14 satellite in the GSLV-D5/GSAT-14 mission.|$|E

30|$|A {{schematic}} {{overview of}} the argon beamline is shown in Fig.  3. A supersonic argon beam is formed by releasing a high pressure (∼ 4 bar) gas into vacuum by a pulsed solenoid valve (Even Lavie type E.L.- 5 - 2005 RT, HRR [40]) running at two times the cyclotron frequency of the synchrotron (153 – 175 Hz). To help keep the pressure in the source chamber below 1 × 10 − 4 mbar, an additional turbo-molecular pump provides a pre-vacuum of < 5 × 10 − 4 mbar to the <b>turbo</b> <b>pumps</b> of the source and detection chambers. The 5 mm diameter skimmer between the source and detection chambers and the 1.5 mm diameter skimmer between the detection and the synchrotron chambers select only the coldest part of the argon beam and ensures that the pressure in the synchrotron chamber remains below 2.2 × 10 − 8 mbar during operation.|$|R
40|$|Electrodynamic {{bearings}} exploit {{repulsive forces}} due to eddy currents to produce positive stiffness by passive means without violating the Earnshaw stability criterion.
