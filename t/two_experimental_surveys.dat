40|$|Ground Based Radar Interferometry is {{a recent}} {{experimental}} methodology, suitable to provide non-contact measurement of deflections on large structures, in static or dynamic conditions. In the last decade the development and application of this microwave remote sensing tool has drawn the attention of several researchers {{and the number of}} case studies reported in the literature is increasing and especially focused on ambient vibration testing of bridges, buildings, ancient towers, chimneys and wind farms. This paper addresses the application of microwave remote sensing in operational modal testing of two outstanding large structures located in Spain: the Communication Tower of Collserola, close to Barcelona, and the bridge crossing the Ebro River at Amposta. After a brief introduction of the adopted radar technique, the main results of the <b>two</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>surveys</b> are presented and discussed. The experimental investigation confirms the reliability of the radar survey to clearly identifying the key dynamic characteristics of large structures as well as the simple and safe way of carrying out measurements...|$|E

Neben der theoretischen Aufarbeitung der relevanten Literatur werden eine Reihe von empirischen Untersuchungen beschrieben, die allgemein auf die Mechanismen und mentalen Prozesse der Risikoperzeption und speziell auf die Einstellungen zur Kernenergie bezogen sind. Unter anderem sind die Ergebnisse einer Repräsentativ-Befragung interpretiert und eine vergleichende Intensivbefragung von deutschen und amerikanischen Versuchspersonen zu Problemen der Verarbeitung risikobezogener Informationen beschrieben worden. Der Prozeß der Risikowahrnehmung wird als eine Abwägung von kognitiven Vorstellungen verstanden, die nach den Gesichtspunkten der Verteilungsgerechtigkeit, der attributiven Zuordnungsmechanismen und der subjektiven Bewertungen gewichtet werden.

The reports contain a systematic summary of the relevant literature in this field {{and a series of}} empirical investigations which enable us to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} risk perception process and attitude formation. For this purpose <b>two</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>surveys</b> have been conducted to reveal cognitive structures when information on risk sources is processed, and to investigate intuitive weighing in the field of risk evaluation. These surveys have also been made by a team of U. S. - psychologists so that a comparison between the German and American data could be performed. The data were further validated by two psychological experiments on the influence of qualitative risk properties. As risk perception was understood as a procedure in which cognitive elements and their subjective evaluations are eventually combined, the end point of perception was regarded to be identical with the formation of an attitude. In order to describe this process, a specific survey was conducted dealing with the attitudes of the general public towards nuclear energy. One of the most interesting results is the finding that the perception of different risk objects is rather similar in Germany and the US. It is surprising, too, that, contrary to the common conception by natural scientists, people in general have a good estimative ability to judge the expected value of different risks. But beyond this estimation of fatalities people also use other criteria (like personal control) to order different objects with respect to their riskiness. Values connected with special objects and projective beliefs seem to play a major role in making risk judgements. In the field of attitude measurement we found out that proponents of nuclear energy have a rather inconsistent and contradictive belief system (cognitive stress), whereas the opponents of nuclear energy are very consistent andhomogenious in their attitudes, but they have lost their faith in the chance of implementing their antinuclear option in the real world (reality stress).

In Study 1, Southern Baptist pastors rated the likelihood of referring to a counselor who was identified as either a Biblical Counselor or a Christian Psychologist, and was identified as either being excellent in interpersonal skills or as using scripture and prayer in counseling. Pastors demonstrated a preference for counselors using scripture and prayer in counseling over those described as having excellent interpersonal skills. In Study 2, psychologist respondents rated the likelihood of referring to a clergyperson who was identified either as a Baptist or a Unitarian universalist, and was identified either as seminary trained or as having a doctoral degree from a prestigious divinity school. Psychologists demonstrated a preference for those with a doctoral degree. The weak effect sizes and comments offered on the surveys suggest that the individual relationship between clergy and psychologist is much more salient than particular demographic characteristics when considering the possibility of collaboration...|$|R

40|$|Does {{the public}} {{know much more}} about {{politics}} than conventionally thought? A {{number of studies have}} recently argued, on various grounds, that the ‘‘don’t know’ ’ (DK) and incorrect responses to traditionally designed and scored survey knowledge items conceal a good deal of knowledge. This paper examines these claims, focusing on the prominent and influential argument that discouraging DKs would reveal a substantially more knowledgeable public. Using <b>two</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>surveys</b> with national random samples, we show that discouraging DKs does little to affect our picture of how much the public knows about politics. For closed-ended items, the increase in correct responses is large but mainly illusory. For open-ended items, it is genuine but minor. We close by examining the other recent evidence for a substantially more knowledgeable public, showing that it too holds little water. C ontemporary politics owes much of its char-acter to the severely right-skewed distribution of political knowledge. The policy deficiency of many campaigns and most campaign coverage, the prevalence and effectiveness of sound bites, the formidable impact of candidate personalities and simple retrospections on votes, the fierce but transient rallying around the president in foreign crises, and, in admittedly debatable ways, the outcomes of many elections—all this and more would be different if the public had the same values and interests it does but the political knowledge of the average legislative aide, political commentator, or even mere reader of the political content of a serious daily newspaper. Or so many of us who study mass politics believe. Many, but not all. Both the fact of widespread political ignorance and its consequences have been disputed—the latter, in recent times, much more than the former. A few years ago, Luskin (2002) described the ‘‘Panglossian side’ ’ in these debates as having retreated from ‘‘denial’ ’ to ‘‘extenuation’’— from the position that most people are not really ignorant (Nie, Verba, and Petrocik 1979) to the position that they are but that their ignorance makes little difference to their policy and electoral prefer-ences (Lupia and McCubbins 1998; Page and Shapiro 1992; Popkin 1991).

40|$|With {{a surface}} wave method to {{estimate}} shear-wave velocity (Vs) from dispersion curve(s) of known mode(s), accurate modal identification {{is obviously a}} crucial issue. In this regard, the dispersion imaging method is an essential processing tool as it can unfold the multi-modal nature of surface waves through direct wavetield transformations. When a combined dispersion curve of an extended frequency range is prepared from analyses of both passive and active surface waves attempting to increase the maximum depth of Vs estimation, the modal nature of the passive curve (as well as the active one) must be assessed although it has usually been considered the fundamental mode. We report <b>two</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>survey</b> cases performed at the same soil site, but at two different times, employing the passive and active versions of the multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) method for an increased investigation depth. In the earlier survey, the modal nature of the imaged dispersion trends from the passive (20 Hz) data sets was identified as the fundamental mode, whereas it was confidently re-identified as the first higher mode from the later survey. Modal inspection with the dispersion image created by combining passive and active image data sets {{was the key to}} this confident analysis. The modal nature of the passive curve was identified from its context with active curves, whose confident analysis therefore had to come first. An active data set acquired with a small (< 1. 0 m) receiver spacing and an impact point located close to the receivers appears important for this purpose...|$|R

40|$|<b>Two</b> <b>experimental</b> {{longline}} <b>surveys</b> {{were carried}} out in the Santa Maria di Leuca (SML) cold-water coral province (Mediterranean Sea) during May-June and September-October 2010 to investigate the effect of corals on fish assemblages. Two types of "megahabitat" characterized by the virtual absence of fishing were explored. One was characterized by complex topography including mesohabitats with carbonate mounds and corals. The other type of megahabitat, although characterized by complex topographic features, lacks carbonate mounds and corals. The fishing vessel was equipped with a 3, 000 m monofilament longline with 500 hooks and snoods of 2. 5 m in length. A total of 9 hauls, using about 4, 500 hooks, {{were carried out}} both in the coral megahabitat and in the non-coral megahabitat during each survey. The fish Leucoraja fullonica and Pteroplatytrygon violacea represent new records for the SML coral province. The coral by-catch was only obtained in the coral megahabitat in about 55 % of the stations investigated in both surveys. The total catches and the abundance indices of several species were comparable between the two habitat typologies. The species contributing most to the dissimilarity between the two megahabitat fish assemblages were Pagellus bogaraveo, Galeus melastomus, Etmopterus spinax and Helicolenus dactylopterus for density and P. bogaraveo, Conger conger, Polyprion americanus and G. melastomus for biomass. P. bogaraveo was exclusively collected in the coral megahabitat, whereas C. conger, H. dactylopterus and P. americanus were found with greater abundance in the coral than in the non-coral megahabitat. Differences in the sizes between the two megahabitats were detected in E. spinax, G. melastomus, C. conger and H. dactylopterus. Although these differences most probably related to the presence-absence of corals, both megahabitats investigated play the role of attraction-refuge for deep-sea fish fauna, confirming the important role of the whole SML coral province as a refuge area from fishing...|$|R

The University of Cape Town Child Guidance Clinic {{had never}} {{evaluated}} its efficacy {{as a community}} service nor its efficacy as a training ground for trainee clinical psychologists. Furthermore, client satisfaction with services offered had not been assessed. Hence this study was undertaken. The unique features of this study are: two types of control groups are used, a non-referred, untreated group of children and a referred untreated group of children and not the problematic defectors extensively used. Inexperienced clinical psychology trainees and experienced registered clinical psychologists conducted therapy for the <b>two</b> <b>experimental</b> groups.

40|$|In the West African region, {{the marine}} {{protected}} areas 'MPAs' were primarily created with conservation objectives, to protect emblematic species and critical habitats. In {{the last ten}} years, their use as fishery management tools has also been advocated, particularly in Senegal. This study aims to assess the observed changes in the fish populations' structures {{in the years following}} fishing bans. The study is conducted in the MPAs of Bamboung and Joal-Fathiouth, in Senegal. We described and analysed the fish assemblage structures using the data from <b>two</b> years' <b>experimental</b> <b>survey</b> (2015 - 2016). In the Bamboung MPA, an increase of total fish biomass and of maximal fish length has been registered after the fishing ban. But over the 2004 - 2016 period, these indicators globally fluctuated. The contribution of marine affinity species has increased in depends of the estuarine part of the assemblage. In addition, the trophic structure has been modified with an overall increase of the mean trophic level, resulting from an increase of the percentage of generalist or piscivorous predators and a sharp decrease of herbivorous and detritivorous species feeding in the low trophic levels. Marine predators which abundance and size were reduced by fisheries were again important components in the Bamboung MPA. For the Joal-Fadhiouth MPA, the fish biomass increased within the reserve with a dominance of small size fishes. This MPA leaded the conservation of certain species, but does not allow the proliferation of large size and high trophic level species. The results of the multivariate analysis showed an increase of abundance of the estuarine affinity species to the detriment of marine species. In addition, the low-trophic level species as herbivorous are more important in the reserve due to the high habitats diversity (mangroves, sandy and muddy bottom, algae) and the fishing ban effects. In summary, we argue that the total ban on fishing in the estuarine area can significantly improve the fish assemblage for the fishing, and this is not evident for a coastal and marine area like Joal-Fadiouth MPA...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} researching Millennial Entitlement from a Millennial {{perspective}} {{was to see}} whether or not Millennials are more entitled than previous generations. This type of research has been done before, but has not accounted for certain biases. One of the biases that this study tries to account for is the generational difference in empowerment. Are Millennials more predisposed towards an internal locus of control than Baby Boomers due to the modern-day emphasis on an individual’s ability to create positive change? Does having a stronger internal locus of control lead to individual empowerment, and does that empowerment get mistaken for entitlement? These, and other questions, were explored during the course of the study. The methods to gather the data needed to answer these questions included: reading expert secondary research on the subject of entitlement and Millennial attitude, conducting focus groups for both Baby Boomers and Millennials to determine the difference in perspectives based on situational factors, and an <b>experimental</b> <b>survey</b> sent out to both Baby Boomers and Millennials to gather quantifiable data on a mass scale.
