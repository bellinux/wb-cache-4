5|$|On January 7, 1989, Reagan {{underwent}} surgery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center {{to repair a}} Dupuytren's contracture of the ring finger of his left hand. The surgery lasted for more <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> and was performed under regional anesthesia. This procedure was done just thirteen days before he left office. For this reason he had a hand and finger bandage {{the day of his}} farewell speech and the day of the inauguration of George H. W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|Beginning around 1 pm, Union {{artillery}} fired first, initially upon infantry in the woods, {{and later}} upon any Confederate artillery that attempted {{to move into}} firing position. On the Confederate left flank, two batteries from Whiting's division and one from Jackson's soon began firing from their position upon Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, who were {{near the center of}} the Union line. This began a fierce firefight, with the Union's eight batteries and 37 guns concentrated against three Confederate batteries and sixteen guns. The Union fire silenced the Rowan Artillery and made their position untenable. The other two Confederate batteries, placed by Jackson himself, were in somewhat better positions, and managed to keep firing. Over a period of more <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours,</b> a total of six or eight Confederate batteries engaged the Union Army from the Confederate left flank, but they were usually engaged only one at a time.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Mughal Empire's {{influence}} declined rapidly as the Hindu Maratha Empire from Deccan Plateau rose to prominence. In 1737, Maratha forces sacked Delhi following their victory against the Mughals in the First Battle of Delhi. In 1739, the Mughal Empire lost the huge Battle of Karnal in less <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> against the numerically outnumbered but militarily superior Persian army led by Nader Shah of Persia. After his invasion, he completely sacked and looted Delhi, carrying away immense wealth including the Peacock Throne, the Daria-i-Noor, and Koh-i-Noor. The Mughals, severely further weakened, could never overcome this crushing defeat and humiliation which also left the way open for more invaders to come, including eventually the British. Nader eventually agreed {{to leave the city}} and India after forcing the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah I to beg him for mercy and granting him the keys {{of the city and the}} royal treasury. A treaty signed in 1752 made Marathas the protectors of the Mughal throne in Delhi.|$|E

5|$|One {{accident}} at the Mousetrap, a complex interchange, had national ramifications. On August 1, 1984, a truck carrying six torpedoes for the U.S. Navy overturned. The situation was made worse {{as no one}} answered at the phone number provided with the cargo, and an unknown liquid was leaking {{from one of the}} torpedoes. It took more <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> before any military personnel arrived on the scene, U.S. Army personnel from a nearby base. The incident left thousands of cars stranded and Denver's transportation network paralyzed for about eight hours. Approximately 50 residents in the area were evacuated. Investigations later revealed that the truck driver did not follow a recommended route provided by state troopers, who specifically warned the driver to avoid the Mousetrap. The Navy promised reforms after being criticized for providing an unstaffed phone number with a hazardous cargo shipment, a violation of federal law, and failing to notify Denver officials about the shipment. The Mousetrap was grandfathered into the Interstate Highway system, with some structures built in 1951. The incident provided momentum to rebuild the interchange with a more modern and safer design. Construction began in several phases in 1987 and the last bridge was dedicated in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{maintained}} a blockade off Malta {{since the beginning}} of the siege, ostensibly led by Rear-Admiral Lord Nelson, who by March 1800 was defying a direct order from his superior officer Lord Keith by remaining in Palermo with his lover Emma, Lady Hamilton. In his absence the blockade was under the command of Captain Manley Dixon of HMS Lion and Nelson's flag captain Sir Edward Berry, who were notified of Decrés' departure by the patrolling frigate HMS Penelope and gave chase. The large ship of the line was initially only attacked by Penelope, which manoeuvered around Guillaume Tells stern, causing severe damage and delaying the French ship sufficiently for Berry to bring his squadron into action. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Decrés continued to fight for more <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours,</b> fighting off two British ships but ultimately unable to resist the combined weight of Berry's attacks. Casualties and damage were severe on both sides, and the defiance of the French ship was celebrated in both countries as a brave defence against overwhelming odds.|$|E

5000|$|For 2002, Intersport left Grand-Am {{and focused}} on ALMS. The dropped down to LMP675, the lowest Le Mans Prototype class, {{purchasing}} an MG-Lola EX257. Duncan Dayton, Michael Durand and Clint Field were his team mates during certain events over the season. LMP675 cars at first tended to be quite unreliable but at the 12 Hours of Sebring, the Intersport Lola did very well, finishing seventh overall and by far the winning LMP675 car. The next nearest LMP675 finisher finished 25th overall, 62 laps behind. Intersport picked up two more victories after Sebring, the first at the Grand Prix of Washington D.C. and at Petit Le Mans. It was evident that the car is more suited for endurance racing rather <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>hour</b> [...] "sprint" [...] races.
