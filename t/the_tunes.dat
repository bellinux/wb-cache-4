5|$|The Epistles are {{admired for}} the way that their poetry and music fit so well together. Bellman chose not to compose <b>the</b> <b>tunes,</b> instead {{borrowing}} and adapting existing melodies, most likely to exploit the humour of contrasting the associations of well-known tunes with the meanings he gave them. This {{may also have been}} intended to provide historical depth to his work; he sometimes devoted considerable energy to adapting melodies to fit an Epistle's needs.|$|E
40|$|When a {{tuning fork}} is sounded {{and held in}} the air, the sound is weak due to the poor {{acoustic}} coupling between <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> fork and <b>the</b> air. If <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> fork is struck and acoustically coupled to a box of the proper size, as in Figure 1, the box functions as a resonator at the frequency of <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> fork, <b>the</b> sound of <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> fork is much louder, as can be heard on the video. When <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> fork is placed on a box of a different resonant frequency, the sound does not become as loud, as demonstrated in the video...|$|R

5|$|The {{successful}} crossing {{was greeted}} with enthusiastic cheers, <b>the</b> <b>tunes</b> of the Young Australian Band, the Albion Brass Band and Cooper and Bailey's International Show Band, who had all come to entertain the crowds, and the shrilling of the steamers' whistles. L'Estrange soon reappeared in a small row boat to greet the crowds, although many had already rushed the steamers to leave, resulting in a few being jostled into the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Celebrating the Christmas season {{had been}} growing in {{popularity}} through the Victorian era. Although the Christmas tree had been introduced in Britain during the 18th century, its use was popularised by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and their practice was copied in many homes across the country. In the early 19th century {{there had been a}} revival of interest in Christmas carols, following a decline in popularity over the previous hundred years. The publication of Davies Gilbert's 1823 work Some Ancient Christmas Carols, With <b>the</b> <b>Tunes</b> to Which They Were Formerly Sung in the West of England and William Sandys's 1833 collection Christmas Carols, Ancient and Modern led to a growth in the form's popularity in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the film's {{success and}} wide-reaching popularity, Saran remade it in Telugu as Gemeni. It {{is the only}} film Saran made in a {{language}} other than Tamil. The remake starred Venkatesh and Namitha in the lead roles, while Kalabhavan Mani and Murali reprised their roles from the Tamil version. Most of the crew members were retained. Posani Krishna Murali translated the dialogues to Telugu. The soundtrack was composed by R. P. Patnaik, who reused most of <b>the</b> <b>tunes</b> from the original film. Released in October 2002, the film received lukewarm response and failed to repeat {{the success of the}} original. In 2013, a Kannada remake was reported to have been planned with Upendra in the lead, but he dismissed the reports as rumours.|$|E

5|$|In February 2012, Legacy Recordings {{signed a}} deal with Nelson that {{included}} the release of new material, as well as past releases that would be selected and complemented with outtakes and other material selected by him. With the new deal, Buddy Cannon returned to produce the recordings of Nelson. After selecting the material {{and the sound of}} <b>the</b> <b>tunes</b> with the singer, Cannon's work method consisted in the recording of the tracks with studio musicians, with the takes later completed on a separate session by Nelson with his guitar. Cannon's association to Nelson also extended to songwriting, with singer and producer composing the lyrics by exchanging text messages.|$|E
5|$|Age of Empires (under {{the working}} title Dawn of Man) {{was the first}} game {{developed}} by Ensemble Studios. Its historical setting was chosen to be more plausible and accessible, particularly to casual gamers, than existing games. At the time, other real-time strategy games had science fiction and fantasy settings, so the historical setting of Age of Empires enabled it to stand out. The designers received much of their inspiration from the game Civilization, with its proven historical setting; this was noted among reviewers as something positive. Age of Empires was designed by Bruce Shelley, Tony Goodman (in charge of the game's artwork), and Dave Pottinger (in charge of the game's artificial intelligence). Stephen Rippy was the music director (a role he kept through the series), with occasional help from his brother, David Rippy, as well as Kevin McMullan. He created the original music in Age of Empires using sounds from actual instruments from the periods in the game, {{as well as their}} digital samples. <b>The</b> <b>tunes</b> were the result of extensive research on the cultures, styles, and instruments used.|$|E
