5|$|The kvitelach {{placed in}} the Western Wall differ from the kvitelach given in Hasidic courts, as they contain prayers, {{requests}} or messages written directly to God. These prayer notes are folded and wedged into the cracks and crevices of the Wall. The rationale for this practice has been traced to the Midrashic <b>teaching</b> <b>that</b> the Divine Presence has never moved from the Western Wall, and the Kabbalistic <b>teaching</b> <b>that</b> all prayers ascend to Heaven through the Temple Mount, which the Western Wall abuts. More than a million prayer notes are {{placed in the}} Western Wall each year.|$|E
5|$|Five Percenter {{membership}} plunged after Clarence13X's death, but rebounded in 1970 {{after new}} leadership emerged and revitalized the group. After his death, {{the group was}} not dominated by a single leader. This {{may have been a}} result of their <b>teaching</b> <b>that</b> all black men are gods, which rendered authoritarian leadership untenable.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Schleiermacher, an {{influential}} nineteenth-century Reformed theologian, saw baptism {{as the way}} the church receives new members and taught that faith is a precondition for baptism. He was ambivalent about the practice of infant baptism, <b>teaching</b> <b>that</b> {{it was not an}} essential institution, but could be continued as long as the church was faithful in bringing children to confirmation. Schleiermacher also saw baptism as primarily individual rather than initiating one into a covenant community, and rejected the idea that baptism should be connected with Old Testament circumcision.|$|E

5|$|Symeon {{wrote in}} a similar style and taught the {{traditional}} views of several early Christian fathers and hesychasts, including St. Augustine, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Mark the Hermit. Where Symeon differed from his predecessors was in his transparent and open sharing of his most interior experiences. Symeon was the first Byzantine mystic to freely share those experiences, which were given {{in the context of}} his <b>teaching</b> <b>that</b> the direct experience of God was something to which all Christians could aspire.|$|E
5|$|The Platonic {{influence}} on Maximus' thought {{can be seen}} most clearly in his theological anthropology. Here, Maximus adopted the Platonic model of exitus-reditus (exit and return), <b>teaching</b> <b>that</b> humanity {{was made in the}} image of God, and the purpose of salvation is to restore us to unity with God. This emphasis on divinization or theosis helped secure Maximus' place in Eastern theology, as these concepts have always held an important place in Eastern Christianity.|$|E

50|$|Oneness Pentecostalism, as {{with other}} modalist groups, <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> the Holy Spirit is a mode of God, rather than a {{distinct}} or separate person from the Father.

5|$|Applewhite {{began to}} {{emphasize}} a strict hierarchy, <b>teaching</b> <b>that</b> his students needed his guidance, as {{he needed the}} guidance of the Next Level. Zeller notes that this naturally ensured {{that there would be no}} possibility of the group's continuing if Applewhite were to die. A relationship with Applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation; he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ. Zeller states that the group's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite's role as a mediator. Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but, in the 1980s, the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Matilda Joslyn Gage {{took time}} {{out from her}} {{participation}} in the Revising Committee to write Woman, Church and State, a book which challenged traditional Judeo-Christian <b>teaching</b> <b>that</b> women were the source of sin, and that sex was sinful. Gage wrote that the double standard for morality hurt both sexes. Gage differed {{from most of the}} women on the Revising Committee in that she did not feel that the Bible, once interpreted in a more true, original form, would support women's rights. Gage determined that the Church had acted against women's interests in important ways: from Roman Catholic canon law, to Scripture, to its advocacy of celibacy and more. Especially troubling to Gage was the story of Adam and Eve.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{there were}} few visible changes within the church. Tkach {{continued}} Armstrong's tradition of traveling abroad, although his emphasis was more on visiting church members and operations than on Armstrong's agenda of visiting world leaders to attempt to witness to them. The church entered a period of rapid growth {{during the early years}} of Tkach's administration. In fact, the membership peaked during his tenure at 126,800 members in 1988. The finances were stable, largely due to the church's <b>teaching</b> <b>that</b> members should tithe, giving a tenth of their gross income to the church. The church magazine, The Plain Truth, continued to serialize the final and most controversial book by Armstrong, Mystery of the Ages. Tkach also continued, at least in public, to promote the church's unique doctrines.|$|E

40|$|Fertility {{regulation}} is taught didactically in 82 of 94 medical school departments {{of obstetrics and}} gynecology in the United States and Canada, but students are given clinical experience in only 59 medical schools, according to a survey conducted in 1964 by a committee of the American Public Health Association. Legal prohibitions impeded teaching in 1964 in two States and in all of Canada. Nearly all schools <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> help with fertility regulation should be offered for medical and socioeconomic stress, and most <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> it should be offered routinely in premarital counselling and in the postpartum period, but only two-thirds <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> this help should be given to unmarried adults and only one-third <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> any person requesting help with fertility regulation should receive it...|$|R
5000|$|COGIC <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> the baptism of the Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit is an {{experience}} subsequent to conversion and sanctification, can be experienced by all believers who ask for it. As a Pentecostal church, COGIC <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> when one is baptized in the Holy Spirit, the believer will experience an initial evidence of speaking in tongues (glossolalia) by the will of God. COGIC does not <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> Spirit baptism {{is the same as}} salvation. According to the Articles of Religion, [...] "We believe that we are not baptized with the Holy Ghost in order to be saved, but that we are baptized with the Holy Ghost because we are saved". COGIC also <b>teaches</b> <b>that</b> all the spiritual gifts are for believers today.|$|R
5|$|Besides the schism, the Western Church was riven by {{theological}} controversies, some {{of which}} turned into heresies. John Wycliffe (d. 1384), an English theologian, was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for <b>teaching</b> <b>that</b> the laity {{should have access to}} the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the Eucharist that were contrary to Church doctrine. Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: Lollardy in England and Hussitism in Bohemia. The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance. The Hussite Church, although the target of a crusade, survived beyond the Middle Ages. Other heresies were manufactured, such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French King Philip IV (r. 1285–1314) and the Hospitallers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 12th century, many {{critics of the}} {{examination}} system and government-run schools initiated a movement to revive private academies. During {{the course of the}} Southern Song, the academy became a viable alternative to the state school system. Even those that were semi-private or state-sponsored were still seen as independent of the state's influence and their teachers uninterested in larger, nationwide issues. One of the earliest academic institutions established in the Song period was the Yuelu Academy, founded in 976 during the reign of Emperor Taizu (r. 960–976). The Chinese scientist and statesman Shen Kuo was once the head chancellor of the Hanlin Academy, established during the Tang dynasty. The Neo-Confucian Donglin Academy, established in 1111, was founded upon the staunch <b>teaching</b> <b>that</b> adulterant influences of other ideologies such as Buddhism should not influence the teaching of their purely Confucian school. This belief hearkened back to the writings of the Tang essayist, prose stylist, and poet Han Yu (768–824), who was certainly a critic of Buddhism and its influence upon Confucian values. Although the White Deer Grotto Academy of the Southern Tang (937–976) had fallen out of use during the early half of the Song, the Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi (1130–1200) reinvigorated it.|$|E
5|$|Hensley's first {{experience}} with snake handling occurred between 1908 and 1914, after which he held snake-handling services in parts of rural Tennessee. His supporters later asserted that a revival broke out {{at the start of}} his ministry, a claim considered dubious by historians. At first, the Church of God did not object to his snake-handling services, and, in 1914, he held a snake-handling meeting with a Church of God bishop in Cleveland, Tennessee. The next year, Hensley applied to be licensed as a Church of God minister, but required his wife's assistance to complete the paperwork owing to his illiteracy. He had memorized some Bible verses but also stated that he received divine revelation while speaking. After being licensed, Hensley held Church of God services throughout Tennessee, including revival services at church general assemblies. He preached about the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, a Pentecostal <b>teaching</b> <b>that</b> referred to an additional spiritual experience after conversion. His ministry was often mentioned in Church of God newsletters, and his wife Amanda contributed an article about him. In the 1910s, Hensley is thought to have led churches in Grasshopper Valley (northwest of Cleveland, Tennessee); Cleveland; and Birchwood, Tennessee.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of process theology has challenged the Irenaean tradition by <b>teaching</b> <b>that</b> God's power is limited {{and that he}} cannot be responsible for evil. Twentieth century philosopher Alvin Plantinga supported {{the idea that this}} world is the best possible world, arguing that the good in the world (including God's infinite goodness) outweighs the evil and proposing that the ultimate good of God's sacrifice when Jesus was crucified necessitated the existence of evil. His free will defence was not a theodicy because he was trying to show the logical compatibility of evil and the existence of God, rather than the probability of God. D. Z. Phillips and Fyodor Dostoyevsky challenged the instrumental use of suffering, suggesting that love cannot be expressed through suffering. However, Dostoyevsky also states that the beauty of love is evident, in that love can continue to grow, withstand and overcome even the most evil acts. Michael Tooley argued that the magnitude of suffering is excessive and that, in some cases, cannot lead to moral development. French theologian Henri Blocher criticised Hick's universalism, arguing that such a view negates free will, which was similarly important to the theodicy.|$|E

500|$|The Reformed confessions <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> Christ's true {{body and}} blood are really present in the Lord's Supper.

Reformed confessions <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> partakers of the Supper, {{in the words of}} the Belgic Confession, partake of [...] "the proper and natural body and the proper blood of Christ". However, they deny the explanations for this eating and drinking made by Lutherans and Catholics. Against Catholics, Reformed confessions <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> the bread and wine of the Supper do not become the blood and body of Christ, as in the Catholic view of transubstantiation. Against Lutherans, Reformed confessions do not <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> partakers of the Supper physically eat Christ's body and drink his blood with their mouths (...) [...] While Reformed confessions <b>teach</b> <b>that</b> in the Supper Christ is received in both his divine and human natures, the manner of eating is believed to be spiritual (...)
