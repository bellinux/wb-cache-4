5|$|After {{tying up}} Ms. Botz, the kids find all their {{telephones}} disabled (which Ms. Botz had done earlier) {{and go to}} a nearby payphone to alert the authorities. Meanwhile, Marge tries to call home <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the kids but because there is no answer, she and Homer decide to cancel their motel reservation and go home. They find Ms. Botz bound and gagged in front of the TV. Homer, thinking his children have gotten the best of another babysitter and unaware of her true identity, frees her and pays her handsomely. After advising Homer to keep both eyes on Bart, Ms. Botz makes a clean getaway, just seconds before the kids arrive with the police and news media to arrest her. As Bart tries to lead the police to the house, Homer attempts to berate him for his behavior towards Ms. Botz, only to be informed by a news reporter about Ms. Botz's true identity and that he just freed her. Realizing his mistake, a humiliated Homer attempts to save face by claiming he fought Botz and she escaped, then warning her on camera never to show her face to him again. Later that night, Homer moans about his blunder on TV, but Marge cheers him up by saying that if he raised three children who can hogtie a perfect stranger, he must be doing something right.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} main {{characters}} in Doom 3. The player assumes {{the role of}} an anonymous space marine corporal who has just arrived on the UAC's Mars base. The player's non-commissioned officer in-charge is Master Sergeant Thomas Kelly, voiced by Neil Ross, who gives the player objectives and advice over the player's radio {{for the first half of}} the game. The antagonist in the story is Dr. Malcolm Betruger, head scientist of the UAC's enigmatic Delta Labs division, who is revealed to be working in collaboration with the forces of Hell to cause the subjugation of humanity. Betruger's demonic voice, provided by Philip L. Clarke, frequently taunts the player as the game progresses. The final two principal characters are Elliott Swann and Jack Campbell. Swann, voiced by Charles Dennis, is a representative of the UAC's board of directors, sent <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Betruger's research as well as investigate the rising number of accidents on the Mars base after a request for assistance from a whistleblower. He is almost always accompanied by Campbell, another space marine who acts as Swann's bodyguard and is armed with a BFG 9000. Campbell is voiced by Andy Chanley. Swann and Campbell are often shown in the game to be a few steps ahead of the player, but cannot be reached and directly communicated with until late in the game. The game also incorporates a large host of minor characters who add details to the story or assist the player in certain segments. The player encounters multiple scientists involved in the various research and development programs and archaeological digs through the UAC base, as well as fellow marines and security guards. Civilian employees engaged in bureaucratic work and maintenance workers are also seen.|$|E

40|$|Background: South Africa is {{committed}} to health reforms that strengthen primary health care. Preparing future doctors to work in primary care teams with other professionals is a priority, and medical schools have shifted towards community-based and decentralised training of medical students. Aim: To evaluate the effect on student performance of the Practical Approach to Care Kit (PACK) (an integrated decision-making tool for adult primary care) during {{the final phase of}} medical student training at Stellenbosch University. Setting: Clinical rotations in family medicine at clinics in the Western Cape. Methods: Mixed methods involving a quasi-experimental study and focus group interviews. Student examination performance was compared between groups with and without exposure to the PACK during their clinical training. Student groups exposed to PACK were interviewed {{at the end of their}} rotations. Results: Student performance in examinations was significantly better in those exposed to the PACK. Students varied from using the PACK overtly or covertly during the consultation <b>to</b> <b>checking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> decisions made after the consultation. Some felt that the PACK was more suitable for nurses or more junior students. Although tutors openly endorsed PACK, very few modelled the use of PACK in their clinical practice. Conclusion: The use of PACK in the final phase of undergraduate medical education improved their performance in primary care. Students might be more accepting and find the tool more useful in the earlier clinical rotations. Supervisors should be trained further in how to incorporate the use of the PACK in their practice and educational conversations...|$|R

His visit to the firing line prior to the Battle of Kolubara in late 1914 boosted morale of the retreating Serbian forces and announced a counter-offensive and sparkling victory against numerically superior Austro-Hungarian forces. Another memorable visit in 1915 involved King Peter, by then 71, picking up a rifle and shooting at enemy soldiers. Following the invasion of Serbia by the joint forces of Germany, Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria in October 1915, King Peter I led the army and tens of thousands of civilian refugees through the high mountains of Albania to the Adriatic sea on a 'Calvary known to few peoples'.|$|E
25|$|Richter {{parachute}}d into Britain on {{the early}} morning of 12 May 1941, landing near London Colney north of London. Richter quickly hid his parachute and equipment {{and spent the next}} few days and nights hiding in the forest, too nervous to travel to London. When Richter eventually came out of hiding, he was approached by a lorry driver who asked Richter for directions. Unable to give directions, Richter aroused the suspicions of the lorry driver who drove a short distance and reported the strange foreigner to a police officer. The police officer found Richter and, after examining his papers and asking him a few questions, decided to take Richter to the local police station. Richter's identity papers, in the name of Fred Snyder, were clearly forged and did not match the expired Czechoslovak passport in his possession (which was in his own name). Richter was sent to Camp 020 where he was interrogated by officers of MI5. Richter was a difficult agent to break and it was only when he was confronted with fellow spy Josef Jakobs that Richter began to crack. Richter revealed the true purpose of his mission, <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> agent Wulf Schmidt.|$|E
40|$|Aim: Various {{research}} studies in countries worldwide {{have shown that}} most repeat offenders quit their criminal career {{at some point in}} life, many of them choosing to do so when they reach the age period of emerging adulthood (18 - 28 years old). This process of quitting crime has been named ‘desistance’. The aim {{of this study is to}} shed more light on why young adult repeat offenders decide to stop their criminal lifestyle and what helps them in this process of desistance. Methods: Data were collected for a group of 81 registered juvenile repeat offenders. Three waves of data collection took place, the first of which went back to the first registered offences committed by the youngsters. During the second wave of data collection, next <b>to</b> <b>checking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> their ‘offence status’ 21 young adults were interviewed to get a better understanding of their motivations in life. The last wave of data was collected when the mean age of the group was 25 years old, to see which part of the group was still criminally active. Results: A motivational model has been developed based on the interviews, from Persistence tot Desistance, from having no wish to give up crime, to consolidating a non-criminal lifestyle. The stages are named: Persisting, Acknowledging, Preparing and Consolidating. This model can help place a young adult repeat offender in his or her process of desistance. Based on which stage the person is in, an approach to help them desist from crime can be chosen. Also it was found that at a mean age of 25 years old, when the group still existed of 79 young adults, 40 of them had given up their criminal career for a minimum of three years. A further 8 persons had given up their criminal career for at least two years. Conclusion: In conclusion can be stated that at 25 years old, half of the group had given up crime for a minimum of three years. This means they quit crime at 22 years old. A second conclusion is that motivation plays a large part in the process of desistance and the motivational stage should be taken into account in trying to aid a person in the process of quitting crime. Desistance is a struggle which entails a large change in a young person’s life and should not be underestimated...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) {{present a}} challenging and expensive public health problem. Polypharmacy is defined {{according to the}} WHO criteria as the, "concurrent use of five or more different prescription medication". Elderly {{are more prone to}} adverse reactions due to comorbid conditions, longer lists of medications and sensitivity to drug effects. The aim of the study is to estimate the incidence and strength of association of ADRs due to polypharmacy among the geriatric cohort attending outpatient clinics at a tertiary care center. METHODS: A hospital based prospective cohort study was conducted at ambulatory care clinics of Aga Khan University Hospital April 2012 to March 2013. One thousand geriatrics patients (age ≥ 65 years) visiting ambulatory clinics were identified. They were divided on the basis of exposure (polypharmacy vs. no polypharmacy). We followed them from the time of their enrollment (day zero) <b>to</b> six weeks, <b>checking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> them once a week. Incidence was calculated and Cox Proportional Hazard Model estimates were used. RESULTS: The final analysis was performed on 1000 elderly patients. The occurrence of polypharmacy was 70 % and the incidence of ADRs was 10. 5 % among the study cohort. The majority (30 %) of patients were unable to read or write. The use of herbal medicine was reported by 3. 2 % of the patients and homeopathic by 3 %. Our Cox adjusted model shows that polypharmacy was 2. 3 times more associated with ADRs, con-current complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) was 7. 4 times and those who cannot read and write were 1. 5 times more associated with ADRs. CONCLUSION: The incidence of ADRs due to poly pharmacy is alarmingly high. The factors associated with ADRs are modifiable. Policies are needed to design and strengthen the prescription pattern...|$|R

40|$|Introduction to the chapter: The {{portability}} and personalized {{nature of}} smartphones facilitates ubiquitous (mobile) being online and constant connectivity, even at school. These affordances extend children’s online opportunities but also pose new challenges (Alper, 2013; Wartella et al., 2014; Haddon & Vincent, 2014). This chapter investigates practices and meanings {{associated with the}} presence of smartphones in a school environment. We can embed this within the circuit of culture (Johnson, 1986; Du Gay et al., 1997), which identifies interconnected cultural processes that help us to understand the role and impact of smartphones in teachers’ and children’s lives. We will use the framework to structure the analysis of how smartphones are being used (consumption), mediated (regulation) and perceived (representation and identity) within a school environment, taking into account the perspectives of both children and teachers. We formulate three research goals. First, we aim to understand the current trends and practices concerning smartphone use and mediation in school environments). Second, we aim to uncover the opportunities and challenges teachers and children experience when dealing with the presence and integration of smartphones at school. Third, we look at the expectations of teachers and children towards a successful integration of smartphones in a school environment. To help us answer these questions, we designated two dichotomies that are visible throughout the various cultural processes we will discuss. First, there is the apparent opposition between the school context and the home context. Previously, these contexts have been studied separately. Smartphones, however, offer functions that have blurred the boundaries between ‘school’ and ‘home’ and between ‘learning’ and ‘entertainment’ (Jenkins, 2006; Jenkins et al., 2006; Jenkins, Ford & Green, 2013). For example, children and teachers use social media (e. g. Facebook) not only as a source of entertainment, but also to communicate about homework and collaborate on school assignments. The second theme is the tension between autonomy and control. Building autonomy or independence is an important developmental task for young people (Kowalski, Limber & Agatston, 2012; Fine, 2004; Ito et al., 2008). On the one hand, smartphones support developing autonomy. They enable children to create their own spaces to interact with peers, without (much) interference of adults (Köhl, Gützenbrucker & Herdin, 2014; Lenhart et. al., 2010). On the other hand, smartphones can also be employed as tools for control and supervision (Blair & Fletcher, 2011; Campbell, 2006; Ling & Yttri, 2002; Nelson, 2010). Parents can easily connect with their children <b>to</b> <b>check</b> how <b>up</b> <b>on</b> them, even during school hours when children are under supervision of their teachers. This {{is an example of how}} smartphones can be a tool for parents to keep in touch and control their children throughout the day. Furthermore, it illustrates again how smartphones contribute to the intertwining of the home and school contexts. This chapter combines insights from both qualitative and quantitative data. As for the children’s perspectives, we draw on the quantitative and qualitative data from the Net Children Go Mobile project collected among 9 to 16 year-olds. The survey data help us to contextualize and explain the qualitative data that in turn provide us with more insight into the experiences and perceptions of the children. As for the teachers’ perspectives, we draw on focus groups, interviews and observation data from three research projects in Belgium (Flanders) in which 41 teachers participated. Our participants teach children aged 3 to 18 years old in kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Smartphones are the main focus of this chapter, but the scope of the studies we build on is wider as they take into account various kinds of mobile media or devices that share affordances such as portability and individual or personal usage. Participants do not always specify the type of device, platform or application, and often talk about ‘mobile media’ in general. Therefore, we also use the terms ‘mobile media’ and ‘mobile devices’ in this chapter, which mainly refer to (platforms and applications for) smartphones and tablets. status: accepte...|$|R

The music system from the original Ultima Underworld was retained with only minor alterations, but the team included digitized sound effects instead of the synthesized audio used in the first game.|$|E
