5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of an {{apparently}} freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods.

40|$|Purification of scrapie prions from hamster brains has {{demonstrated}} that the infectious particles contain one major protein, PrP 27 - 30. This protein, which is required for and inseparable from scrapie infectivity, polymerizes into heterogeneous rod-shaped particles measuring 10 - 20 nm in diameter and 100 - 200 nm in length. We attempted to identify the minimal infectious unit by disrupting aggregates of <b>the</b> <b>rods.</b> Prolonged sonication resulted in progressive fragmentation of <b>the</b> <b>rods</b> into spherical particles with a mean di-ameter of 19 nm and short rods with a mean length of 60 nm.

5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire (and {{elsewhere}} in Central/Eastern Europe), women who killed their newborn could be {{liable to be}} placed in an open grave, and have a stake hammered into their heart. A detailed description of an execution in this manner comes from 17th century Košice (then in Hungary, now in eastern Slovakia). A woman to be executed for infanticide involved an executioner and two assistants to help him. First, a grave some one-and-a-half ell deep was dug. The woman was placed within it, her hands and feet secured by driving nails through them. The executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face. He then placed, and held vertically, a wooden stave at her heart to mark its location, while his assistants piled earth on the woman, keeping her head free of earth {{at the behest of the}} clerics, however, as to do otherwise would have quickened the death process. Once the earth had been piled upon her, the executioner grabbed with a pair of tongs a rod made of iron, which had been made red hot. He positioned the glowing iron rod beside the wooden stave, and as one of his assistants hammered <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> in, the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman's head. It is said that a scream was heard, and that the earth actually moved upwards for a moment, before all was over.|$|E
25|$|Fly rods are, {{in modern}} manufacture, almost always {{built out of}} carbon {{graphite}}. The graphite fibres are laid down in increasingly sophisticated patterns to keep <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> from flattening when stressed (usually referred to as hoop strength). <b>The</b> <b>rod</b> tapers {{from one end to}} the other and the degree of taper determines how much of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> flexes when stressed. The larger amount of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> that flexes the 'slower' <b>the</b> <b>rod.</b> Slower rods are easier to cast, create lighter presentations but create a wider loop on the forward cast that reduces casting distance and is subject to the effects of wind. Furthermore, the process of wrapping graphite fibre sheets to build a rod creates imperfections that result in rod twist during casting. Rod twist is minimized by orienting <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> guides along the side of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> with the most 'give'. This is done by flexing <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> and feeling for the point of most give or by using computerized rod testing.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} model to describe binary mixtures of semi-flexible rods, applied here to fd-virus suspensions.

25|$|Beginners tend {{to point}} with <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> {{to where they}} want to throw, but the {{movement}} of the hand has to be a controlled speed-up and then come to an abrupt stop. <b>The</b> <b>rod</b> will then start to unfurl and the tip of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> will reach a high speed in the required direction. The high speed of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> tip toward the target gives the impulse to make the cast, the abrupt stop and retreat of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> tip is essential for the formation of a loop. Experienced fishermen also improve the speed of the line leaving <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> tip by a technique called hauling, applying a quick fast pull with the hand holding the line. At the end of the cast when the line is stretched the line as a whole will still have speed and the fisherman can let some extra line through their fingers making a false throw, either forward or backward or to finish the cast and start fishing.|$|E
25|$|When {{actively}} fishing, the angler {{may want}} to keep the fly line lightly pressed against <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> handle with the index finger of the casting arm.

50|$|<b>Rodding</b> is <b>the</b> act {{of using}} a drain rod. It is usual to use a {{twisting}} motion to facilitate progress of <b>the</b> <b>rods</b> and flushing with water eases progress. It is important, no matter which way <b>the</b> <b>rods</b> are being moved (towards or away from the blockage) to ensure the twisting is in the direction to tighten up the screw connections as mentioned above. Any unscrewing of <b>the</b> <b>rods</b> whilst in <b>the</b> drain or sewer will lead to their loss and further blockage.|$|R
25|$|A fishing rod's main {{function}} is to bend and deliver a certain resistance or power: While casting, <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> acts as a catapult: by moving <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> forward, the inertia {{of the mass of}} the bait or lure and rod itself, will load (bend) <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> and launch the lure or bait. When a bite is registered and the fisherman strikes, the bending of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> will dampen the strike to avoid line failure. When fighting a fish, the bending of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> not only enables the fisherman to keep the line under tension, but the bending of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> will also keep the fish under a constant pressure which will exhaust the fish and enable the fisherman to actually catch the fish. Also the bending lessens the effect of the leverage by shortening the distance of the lever (<b>the</b> <b>rod).</b> A stiff rod will demand lots of power of the fisherman, while actually less power is put on the fish. In comparison, a deep bending rod will demand less power from the fisherman, but deliver more fighting power to the fish. In practice, this leverage effect often misleads fisherman. Often it is believed that a hard, stiff rod puts more control and power on the fish to fight, while it is actually the fish who is putting the power on the fisherman. In commercial fishing practice, big and strong fish are often just pulled in on the line itself without much effort, which is possible because the absence of the leverage effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{physics of}} flycasting can be {{described}} by the transfer of impulse, the product of mass and speed through <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> from base to top and from the transfer of impulse through the fly line {{all the way to}} the tip of the leader. Because both <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> and the fly line are tapered the smaller amount of mass will reach high speeds as the waves in rod and line unfurl. The waves that travel through the fly line are called loops. Determining factors in reaching the highest speeds are the basal frequency of a rod and the transfer of the speed from the tip of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> to the fly line. At the moment <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> tip reaches its highest velocity the direction of the cast is determined.|$|E
25|$|By {{looking at}} a {{cylindrical}} rod can one tell whether it is twisted? If <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> is perfectly cylindrical, then the circular symmetry of the cross section {{makes it impossible to}} tell {{whether or not it is}} twisted. However, if there were a straight line drawn along the length of <b>the</b> <b>rod,</b> then one could easily say whether or not there is a twist by looking at the state of the line. Drawing a line is gauge fixing. Drawing the line spoils the gauge symmetry, i.e., the circular symmetry U(1) of the cross section at each point of <b>the</b> <b>rod.</b> The line is the equivalent of a gauge function; it need not be straight. Almost any line is a valid gauge fixing, i.e., there is a large gauge freedom. To tell whether <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> is twisted, you need to first know the gauge. Physical quantities, such as the energy of the torsion, do not depend on the gauge, i.e., are gauge invariant.|$|E
