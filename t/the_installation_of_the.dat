5|$|Leaks were noticed {{immediately}} after <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> topping. Harry S. Peterson Co. attempted {{many times to}} fix the leaks. In 1991, the owners contracted Trow to investigate the chronic leaking and find a solution. Two options were provided, but upon consulting with Coreslab, {{it was determined that}} neither plan could go forward due to the HCS not being able to support additional loads.|$|E

5|$|Michael Horodniceanu, {{chief of}} MTA Construction Company, told The New York Times in January 2014 that {{complications}} in <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inclined elevator would likely cause a further delay of about three months, bringing the opening date to very late summer or early fall of 2014, or to November 2014. By March 2014, the station's tentative opening date was {{still to be}} in November 2014.|$|E
5|$|Some users {{reported}} that during <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> November upgrade, some applications (particularly utility {{programs such as}} CPU-Z and Speccy) were automatically uninstalled during the upgrade process, and some default programs were reset to Microsoft-specified defaults (such as Photos app, and Microsoft Edge for PDF viewing), both without warning.|$|E
5|$|The clock dial {{has been}} dated {{to either the}} {{building}} phases of 1405 or 1467-83, or to <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brunner clockwork in 1527-30. Ueli Bellwald notes that the planisphere uses a southern projection, as was characteristic for 15th-century astronomical clocks; all later such clocks use a northern projection. This would seem to confirm the dating of the clock to the 1405 or 1467/83 renovations.|$|E

This was the first permanent exhibition dedicated to the Holocaust in a UK museum; its development had taken five years at a cost of £5 million.

5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony for}} the first Swift station, located at Airport Road in south Everett, was held on December 3, 2008, and was attended by Community Transit CEO Joyce Eleanor, U.S. Senator Patty Murray, and the mayors of Everett and Marysville. Stations were constructed in two phases: the first consisting of utility relocation and pouring of the concrete shelter pad; the second being <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shelters, beacons, and other amenities beginning in June 2009. The first station to be completed, a training facility at the Merrill Creek bus base, was opened during a media event on May 5, 2009; in September 2009, the first station on the line was completed at 196th Street in Lynnwood.|$|E

5|$|During the Early Classic, cities {{throughout}} the Maya region {{were influenced by}} the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico. In AD 378, Teotihuacan decisively intervened at Tikal and other nearby cities, deposed their rulers, and installed a new Teotihuacan-backed dynasty. This intervention was led by Siyaj K'ak' ("Born of Fire"), who arrived at Tikal in early 378. The king of Tikal, Chak Tok Ich'aak I, died on the same day, suggesting a violent takeover. A year later, Siyaj K'ak' oversaw the installation of a new king, Yax Nuun Ahiin I. <b>The</b> <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new dynasty led to a period of political dominance when Tikal became the most powerful city in the central lowlands.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, the MTA {{announced}} that the contract covering the tunnels, the station mezzanine and passenger platform was 85% complete, and that the systems contract, covering mechanical and electrical systems, electric power, lighting and train tracks would be awarded by July 2011. The systems contract was awarded in September 2011. In May 2012, the MTA {{announced that}} the extension, now 65% complete, had received <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first set of rails.

5|$|The {{building}} has two rooms and an attached kitchen {{on the ground}} floor with a staircase between them leading to the living quarters in the first floor rooms.

The front room has recesses {{on either side of the}} arched fireplace. The rear room {{on the ground floor}} was the hall and still has its 16th-century ceiling panels and four-light window. The ceiling has plaster decorations from the Elizabethan era, when the kitchen block was also added.|$|E

5|$|The {{sanctuary}} was enlarged in 1905 {{with the}} addition of a transept and several Tiffany windows while Stone was minister. Further significant development occurred in 1931 under T. Guthrie Speers, {{with the addition}} of the current chancel designed by notable architect Ralph Adams Cram and <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present 4-manual pipe organ by Ernest M. Skinner. Speers had a popular ministry at Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church from 1928 to 1957. He began an outreach program to Baltimore's Jewish community, occasionally exchanging pulpits with local rabbis.|$|E
5|$|The stadium has {{facilities}} for players and match officials {{in a basement}} area below the west stand, which also contains a kitchen providing meals for up to 6,000 people on match days, press rooms, ground staff storage, and a prison cell.

Fitting out of the hospitality suites, kitchens, offices, and concourse concessions was accomplished by KSS Architects, and included <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> communications cabling and automatic access control system.|$|E
5|$|A post-war {{review by}} the Australian government's Defence Committee {{recommended}} that the RAN be restructured around a task force incorporating multiple aircraft carriers. Initial plans were for three carriers, with two active and a third in reserve at any given time, although funding cuts led to the purchase of only two carriers in June 1947; Terrible and sister ship Majestic, for the combined cost of AU£2.75 million, plus stores, fuel, and ammunition. As Terrible was fitted out as a flagship and was the closer of the two ships to completion, construction was finished without major modification. Although Terrible was due for completion on 24 June 1948, a skilled labour shortage affected <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship's boilers, causing the Admiralty to revise the delivery date to October 1948.|$|E

5|$|At the {{expiration}} of his partial term in 1942, Chandler faced a challenge from former ally John Y. Brown, Sr. in the Democratic primary. As {{a result of}} his votes on the anti-lynching bill and the poll tax repeal, the Louisville chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People worked against his re-election effort. During the campaign, Brown accused Chandler of abusing his power, including having a swimming pool installed at his home in violation of the federal rationing provisions implemented during World War II. Chandler invited the Truman Committee to investigate <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pool; the committee found no violations of the federal rationing provisions. Chandler went on to defeat Brown and was easily re-elected in the general election over Republican Richard J. Colbert.|$|E
5|$|During {{the siege}} of the city by the Fourth Crusade, the sea walls {{nonetheless}} {{proved to be a}} weak point in the city's defences, as the Venetians managed to storm them. Following this experience, Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) took particular care to heighten and strengthen the seaward walls immediately after the Byzantine recapture of the city in 1261, since a Latin attempt to recover the city was regarded as imminent. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Genoese at Galata across the Golden Horn, agreed upon in the Treaty of Nymphaeum, posed a further potential threat to the city. Time being short, as a Latin attempt to recover the city was expected, the sea walls were heightened by the addition of two-meter high wooden and hide-covered screens. Ten years later, facing the threat of an invasion by Charles d'Anjou, a second line of walls was built behind the original maritime walls, although no trace of them survives today.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, {{one of the}} TBMs {{completed}} its tunnel at the cavern. The second TBM broke through {{the wall of the}} cavern on July 15, 2010, completing its tunneling operation.

In April 2011, the MTA announced that the contract covering the tunnels, the 34th Street station mezzanine and passenger platform was 85% complete, and that the systems contract, covering mechanical and electrical systems, electric power, lighting and train tracks would be awarded by July 2011.
