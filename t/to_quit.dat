40|$|This paper {{presents}} an econometric {{analysis of the}} effect of policy instruments such as prices, restrictions to use and health warnings on the decisions <b>to</b> start and <b>quit</b> smoking. The duration up to starting and up <b>to</b> <b>quitting</b> is represented with several parametric models for the hazard function, and statistical tests are used to choose the best specification. The estimates reveal that prices have a very weak effect on the duration up to starting. On the contrary, the duration up <b>to</b> <b>quitting</b> is shortened by increases in the prices of the cheapest varieties of cigarrettes in the Spanish market. This evidence suggests specific directions for change in the structure of tobacco taxes. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
