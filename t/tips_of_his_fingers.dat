5|$|Tony Iommi {{has been}} {{credited}} as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings. The <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> were severed in a steel factory, and while using thimbles (artificial finger tips) {{he found that}} standard guitar strings were too difficult to bend and play. He {{found that there was}} only one size of strings available, so after years with Sabbath he had strings custom made.|$|E
25|$|According to Art O'Leary, {{as early}} as March 1934, Dillinger {{expressed}} an interest in plastic surgery and had asked O'Leary to check with Piquett on such matters. At the end of April, Piquett paid a visit to his old friend Dr. Wilhelm Loeser. Loeser had practiced in Chicago for 27 years before being convicted under the Harrison Narcotic Act in 1931. He was sentenced to three years at Leavenworth, but was paroled early on December 7, 1932, with Piquett's help. He later testified that he performed facial surgery on himself and obliterated the fingerprint impressions on the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> by the application of a caustic soda preparation. Piquett said Dillinger would have to pay $5,000 for the plastic surgery: $4,400 split between Piquett, Loeser and O'Leary, and $600 to Dr. Harold Cassidy, who would administer the anaesthetic. The procedure would take place at the home of Piquett's longtime friend, 67-year-old James Probasco, at the end of May.|$|E
25|$|Freddy Krueger's {{physical}} appearance has remained largely consistent throughout the film series, although minor {{changes were made}} in subsequent films. He wears a striped red-and-green sweater (solid red sleeves in the original film), a dark brown fedora, his bladed glove, loose black trousers (brown in the original film), and worn work boots, {{in keeping with his}} blue collar background. His skin is scarred and burned as a result of being burned alive by the parents of Springwood, and he has no hair at all on his head as it presumably all burned off. In the original film, only Freddy's face was burned, while the scars have spread to the rest of his body from the second film onwards. His blood is occasionally a dark, oily color, or greenish in hue when he is in the Dreamworld. In the original film, Freddy remains in the shadows and under lower light much longer than he does in the later pictures. In the second film, there are some scenes where Freddy is shown without his bladed glove, and instead with the blades protruding from the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> As the films began to emphasize the comedic, wise-cracking aspect of the character, he began to don various costumes and take on other forms, such as dressing as a waiter or wearing a Superman inspired version of his sweater with a cape (The Dream Child), appearing as a video game sprite (Freddy's Dead), a giant snake-like creature (Dream Warriors), and a hookah smoking caterpillar (Freddy vs. Jason).|$|E

2500|$|As the 1939 season got underway, former Michigan {{head coach}} Fielding H. Yost called Frutig the {{greatest}} Michigan pass receiver since Bennie Oosterbaan. Yost said, [...] "He's got {{the grace and}} the speed. And the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> appear coated with glue."

6000|$|Thus shall {{the souls}} that abide in their sins cry {{out in the}} {{bitterness}} of their spirits, with wonderful anguish and torment of conscience, without intermission; 'That he may dip the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> in water, and cool my tongue.' That he, namely, the man who before I scorned should eat with the dogs of my flock, that before I slighted and had no regard of, that I shut out of door; send him, 'that he may dip the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> in water, and cool my tongue.' ...|$|R
60|$|He pointed, {{and there}} at the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and sliding down the air with wings {{flapping}} slowly and {{at the speed of}} an exceptionally languid snail--was a bee.|$|R
6000|$|... "And if {{the giant}} happens {{not to be}} in the humor," [...] remarked Hercules, {{balancing}} his club on the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger,</b> [...] "perhaps I shall find means to persuade him!" ...|$|R

6000|$|Reluctantly {{the bundle}} was {{abandoned}} to its mother, who {{carried it to}} where Mr. Merrick was nervously standing. “Yes, yes,” he said, touching one cheek gently with the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger.</b> “It—it’s a fine child, Louise; really a—a—creditable child. But—eh—isn’t it rather—soft?” ...|$|R
60|$|He put the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> on a spot close {{under his}} breastbone, the very spot {{of the human}} body where a Japanese gentleman begins the {{operations}} of the Harakiri, which is a form of suicide following upon dishonour, upon an intolerable outrage to the delicacy of one's feelings.|$|R
60|$|The man in {{the chair}} beat with the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> upon the table by his side. He spoke in a dull, unemotional tone.|$|E

40|$|Script {{from the}} WBAP-TV/NBC station in Fort Worth, Texas, {{covering}} {{a news story}} {{about a man who}} crashed into a switcher engine with a borrowed car.

6000|$|... "Good morrow to you, Cuffe," [...] said Dashwood, {{giving the}} other the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> {{as soon as the}} ceremonious part of the {{reception}} was over; and casting a glance, half admiring, half critical, at the appearance of things on deck--"What has Nelson sent us down here about this fine morning, and--ha!--how long have you had those brass ornaments on your capstan?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{disappeared}} into the bathroom. His father, taking a chair, placed the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> together and in this attitude remained motionless, a figure of disapproval and suppressed annoyance.|$|E
60|$|Oakes {{sank into}} a chair like a {{crouching}} leopard, and placed the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> together. He nodded curtly. It {{was part of his}} pose to be keen and silent.|$|E

6000|$|... "No {{doubt there}} is a good deal to be said for him," [...] O'Grady said, seriously. [...] "Give a dog a bad name, you know, and you may hang him; and I have no doubt the Old One has been held {{responsible}} for lots of things he never had as much as the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> in at all, at all." ...|$|R
60|$|Now these words, 'that he may dip the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> in water,' &c., do hold {{forth the}} least {{friendship}} or favour; {{as if he}} should have said, Now I would be glad of the least mercy, now I would be glad of the least comfort, though it be but one drop of cold water on the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger.</b> One {{would have thought that}} this had been a small request, a small courtesy--ONE DROP OF WATER--what is that? Take a pail full of it if that will do thee any good. But mark, he is not permitted to have so much as one drop, {{not so much as a}} man may hold upon the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> finger; this signifies that they that fall short of Christ shall be tormented even as long as eternity lasteth, and shall not have so much as the least ease, no not so long as while a man may turn himself round, not so much leave as to swallow his spittle, not a drop of cold water.|$|R
60|$|This was true, {{since they}} could only {{perceive}} the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> outstretched <b>fingers</b> appearing upon {{each side of the}} smoke-fan.|$|R

60|$|Mrs Verloc, {{turning her}} head slowly, {{transferred}} her stare {{from the wall}} to her husband’s person. Mr Verloc, with the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> between his lips, was looking on the ground.|$|E
6000|$|She {{repeated}} her question. For answer, {{he looked}} at her, held out his hand, and rubbing the ball of his thumb across the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> said, with a fine, handsome smile: ...|$|E

5000|$|In August 2005, Lee Spievack, then in {{his early}} sixties, accidentally sliced off the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right middle <b>finger</b> just above the first phalanx. His brother, Dr. Alan Spievack, was researching {{regeneration}} and provided him with powdered extracellular matrix, developed by Dr. Stephen Badylak of the McGowan Institute of Regenerative Medicine. Mr. Spievack covered the wound with the powder, and the <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> re-grew in four weeks. The news was released in 2007. Ben Goldacre has described this as [...] "the missing finger that never was", claiming that fingertips regrow and quoted Simon Kay, professor of hand surgery at the University of Leeds, who from the picture provided by Goldacre described the case as seemingly [...] "an ordinary fingertip injury with quite unremarkable healing" ...|$|R
