40|$|The marine {{flagellate}} Dunaliella bioculata, {{which is}} easily cultivated under laboratory conditions, is a suitable organism {{for assessing the}} importance of the radioactive contamination by 3 H bound to organic molecules. We have studied the uptake of the following tritiated precursors: thymidine-methyl- 3 H, adenine- 2 - 3 H, uridine- 5 - 3 H, l-leucine- 4 - 3 H, glycine- 2 - 3 H, l-arginine- 3. 4 - 3 H, 1 -aspartic acid- 2. 3 - 3 H, 1 -phenylalanine- 2. 3 - 3 H, D-glucose- 2 - 3 H and D-glucose- 6 - 3 H. Under the experimental conditions (2000 lux; incubation time 30 min), all <b>tritiated</b> <b>molecules</b> are taken up by D. bioculata. Their intracellular concentration may reach that of the external medium. However, leucine and adenine accumulate in the algae: their respective concentrations are 10 and 100 times higher than in the culture medium. The molecular distribution of 3 H has been studied by various biochemical techniques and by sieve chromatography on sepharose 4 B. It has been found that more l-leucine- 4 - 3 H is incorporated into acid and acetone soluble substances than into proteins. Adenine- 2 - 3 H is mainly incorporated into macromolecules of biological significance (RNA, DNA). CsCl gradient centrifugation has shown that the total DNA of Dunaliella is constituted by a major (p{variant}= 1. 707 g/cm 3) and by a minor (p{variant}= 1. 693 g/cm 3) component...|$|E
30|$|GPR 44 was {{initially}} selected as a suitable target for beta cell imaging by a proteomic screening in the Human Protein Atlas [19, 20], where the receptor expression in different pancreatic compartments were qualitatively assessed [2]. Importantly, GPR 44 was co-localized with insulin (beta cell marker) (Pearson’s correlation Rr[*]=[*] 0.845) but not glucagon (alpha cell marker) (Rr[*]=[*] 0.093) [2]. Furthermore, GPR 44 was localized on the cellular membrane, readily available for radioligand binding [3]. GPR 44 was negative in beta cell deficient islets in long standing T 1 D, but positive in the rare insulin-positive islets {{found in the}} pancreas from acute onset T 1 D [2]. Transcriptomics of the pancreas corroborated these results; GPR 44 mRNA was 26 times higher in human islets of Langerhans compared to exocrine tissue [3]. A <b>tritiated</b> small <b>molecule</b> GPR 44 ligand demonstrated an islet-to-exocrine ratio of 20, and a beta cell-to-exocrine ratio of 90 on cellular homogenates [3].|$|R
40|$|We have tritium labeled two {{nucleic acid}} molecules, an 8 kDa DNA {{oligomer}} and a 20 kDa ‘hammerhead’ RNA for tritium NMR investigations. The DNA sequence studied {{has been previously}} used in homonuclear studies of DNA-bound water molecules and tritium NMR was expected to facilitate these investigations by eliminating the need to suppress the water resonance in tritium-detected 3 H- 1 H NOESY experiments. We observed the anticipated through-space interactions found in B-form DNA in the NOESY experiments and an unexpected ‘antiphase’ cross-peak at the water frequency. T 1 measurements on the <b>tritiated</b> DNA <b>molecule</b> indicated that relaxation rates were also accelerated for tritium and protons. Tritium NMR spectra of the hammerhead RNA molecule indicated conformational dynamics in the conserved region of the molecule {{in the absence of}} Mg 2 + and spermine, two components necessary for cleavage. The dynamics were also investigated by 15 N-correlated 1 H spectroscopy and persisted after the addition of Mg 2 + and spermine...|$|R

In a second embodiment of the invention, a substance is tritiated by placing the same near, {{but not in the}} path of, an electron beam which traverses a chamber; admitting tritium gas into the chamber; and subjecting the tritium to the electron beam thereby generating vibrationally excited tritium gas molecules which collide and react with the substance thus incorporating tritium atoms into the substance.

40|$|Molecular imaging of {{the free}} fatty acid {{receptor}} 1 (FFAR 1) would be a valuable tool for drug development by enabling in vivo target engagement studies in human. It has also been suggested as a putative target for beta cell imaging, but the inherent lipophilicity of most FFAR 1 binders produces high off-target binding, which has hampered progress in this area. The {{aim of this study}} was to generate a suitable lead compound for further PET labeling. In order to identify a lead compound for future PET labeling for quantitative imaging of FFAR 1 in human, we evaluated <b>tritiated</b> small <b>molecule</b> FFAR 1 binding probes ([H- 3]AZ 1, [H- 3]AZ 2 and [H- 3]TAK- 875) for their off-target binding, receptor density and affinity in human pancreatic tissue (islets and exocrine) and rodent insulinoma. [H- 3]AZ 1 showed improved specificity to FFAR 1, with decreased off-target binding compared to [H- 3]AZ 2 and [H- 3]TAK- 875, while retaining high affinity in the nanomolar range. FFAR 1 density in human islets was approximately 50 % higher than in exocrine tissue. AZ 1 is a suitable lead compound for PET labeling for molecular imaging of FFAR 1 in humans, due to high affinity and reduced off-target binding...|$|R
40|$|A tritium {{experimental}} {{system for}} 100 Ci/run was {{established at the}} Hydrogen Isotope Research Center, Toyama University. The system has two distinct experimental chambers: a tritium circulation system and an exhaust-gas detritiation device. The former consists of tritium storage, purification and gas chromatographic hydrogen isotope separation units. The performance of the isotope separation unit was examined for 20 Pa･ｌ, a sample gas mixture containing protium, deuterium and tritium under the conditions of operation temperature at 77 K and carrier-gas (Ne) flow of 50 cc/min. Six isotope compounds of hydrogen were reproducibly separated within an adequate period of time (within 5000 seconds). In addition, the relative sensitivities of the thermal conductivity detector could be determined in-situ {{with the aid of}} an ionization chamber for detecting <b>tritiated</b> hydrogen isotope <b>molecule...</b>|$|R
40|$|The isotopically {{substituted}} molecule (6 - 13 C, 1, 6, 6 - 2 H 3) glucose {{was evaluated}} {{to determine whether}} metabolic 2 H loss would prevent its use in quantitating pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity. PPP activity causes the C 1 of glucose to be lost as CO 2, while C 6 can appear in lactate. 2 H NMR analysis of the lactate produced from this glucose can distinguish (3 - 2 H) -lactate (from C 1 of glucose) from (3 - 13 C, 3, 3 - 2 H Z) lactate (from C 6 of glucose). 2 H NMR spectroscopic analysis of medium containing (4 - 13 C, 1, 6, 6 − 2 H 3) glucose after incubation with cultured rat 9 L glioma cells suggested a 30. 8 ± 2. 1 % PPP activity as compared with 6. 0 ± 0. 8 % from separate, parallel incubations with (1 - 13 C) glucose and (6 - 13 C) glucose. Subsequent experiments with other isotopically labeled glucose molecules suggest that this discrepancy is due to selective loss of 2 H from the C 1 position of glucose, catalyzed by phosphoman-nose isomerase. Failure to consider 2 H exchange from the C 1 and C 6 positions of glucose can lead to incorrect conclusions in metabolic studies utilizing this and other deuterated or <b>tritiated</b> glucose <b>molecules...</b>|$|R
40|$|Measurement of {{pulmonary}} clearance of an inhaled aerosol of technetium- 99 m labelled diethylenetriaminepenta-acetate (DTPA) {{by external}} detection methods {{has been used}} widely as an index of permeability across alveolar epithelium and bronchial mucosa. To determine {{the applicability of the}} tracer to measurement of permeability in the airways the diffusion and binding characteristics of 99 mTc DTPA and the chemically related ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid labelled with carbon- 14 (14 C EDTA) was studied in purified respiratory tract mucus glycoprotein from patients with chronic bronchitis. The diffusion coefficients for 99 mTc DTPA and 14 C EDTA through mucus gels were significantly lower than those for <b>tritiated</b> water. Both <b>molecules</b> bound to the mucus gels with high affinity at two independent low capacity sites. Appreciable amounts of 99 mTc DTPA or 14 C EDTA are therefore unlikely to cross mucus layers of physiological thickness over periods of four or five hours. This suggests that when pulmonary clearance is determined by the 99 mTc DTPA method the tracer retained in mucus lined airways will provide background activity. This study supports the assumption that pulmonary clearance measurements are mainly measuring alveolar epithelial permeability and should not be used to study bronchial epithelial permeability...|$|R
40|$|Passive permeabilities of {{the cell}} wall and {{protoplast}} of Bacillus megaterium strain KM were characterized by use of 50 hydrophilic probing <b>molecules</b> (<b>tritiated</b> water, sugars, dextrans, glycols, and polyglycols) which varied widely in size. Weight per cent uptake values (Rw) were measured at diffusional equilibrium under conditions that negated the influences of adsorption or active transport. Plots of Rw for intact cells {{as a function of}} number-average molecular weight (¯Mn) or Einstein-Stokes hydrodynamic radius (¯rES) of the solutes showed three phases: a protoplast uptake phase with a polydisperse exclusion threshold of ¯Mn = 0. 6 × 103 to 1. 1 × 103, ¯rES = 0. 6 to 1. 1 nm; a cell wall uptake phase with a polydisperse exclusion threshold of ¯Mn = 0. 7 × 105 to 1. 2 × 105, ¯rES ≅ 8. 3 nm; and a total exclusion phase. Isolated cell walls showed only the latter two phases. However, it became evident that the cell wall selectively passed only the smallest molecules in a heterodisperse polymer sample. When the molecular-weight distributions of polyglycol samples (¯Mn = 1, 000, 1, 450, and 3, 350) were determined by analytical gel chromatography before and after uptake by intact cells or isolated cell walls, a quasi-monodisperse exclusion threshold was obtained corresponding to Mn = 1, 200, rES = 1. 1 nm. The permeability of isolated protoplasts was assessed by the relative ability of solutes to effect osmotic stabilization. An indefinite exclusion threshold, evident even with monodisperse sugars, was attributed to lengthwise orientation of the penetrating rod-shaped molecules. Altogether, the best estimate of the limiting equivalent porosity of the protoplast was 0. 4 to 0. 6 nm in radius and {{of the cell}} wall, 1. 1 nm...|$|R
