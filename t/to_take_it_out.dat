25|$|Anti-lynching advocates such as Mary McLeod Bethune and Walter Francis White {{campaigned for}} presidential {{candidate}} Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. They {{hoped he would}} lend public support to their efforts against lynching. Senators Robert F. Wagner and Edward P. Costigan drafted the Costigan-Wagner bill in 1934 to require local authorities to protect prisoners from lynch mobs. Like the Dyer bill, it made lynching a Federal crime in order <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of state administration.|$|E

The Steelers added two touchdowns in the final quarter—on a Gary Russell rush and Tyrone Carter's return of his second interception of the game. [...] "We were so upset we had to practice on Christmas, we had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> on the Browns," [...] said Larry Foote after the victory.|$|E

500|$|According to reports, {{the group}} had been eating and {{drinking}} together and [...] "having a party" [...] earlier in the day. Although the charter bus which Ram Singh drove on weekdays was not permitted to pick up public passengers or even to operate in Delhi because of its tinted windows, they decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> [...] "to have some fun". A few hours before committing the gang rape, the attackers had robbed a carpenter. The carpenter was 35-years old Ram Adhar who boarded the bus which was being driven by Mukesh Singh. The juvenile convict had lured him into the bus saying {{it was going to}} Nehru Place. He was then beaten up, robbed of his cellphone and 1500 in cash. After robbing him, the group dumped him at the IIT Flyover. Ram reported about the group in the bus robbing him to three police constables Kailash, Ashok and Sandeep who were passing nearby. They however refused to take action saying that the crime scene wasn't under their purview as they were from the Hauz Khas police station and he will have to report the incident to the Vasant Vihar police station.|$|E

[...] With the boat having been built in Coos Bay, it was necessary <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> into the open ocean to the Coquille River [...] to be placed into service, which [...] "attracted much attention, as it was built for river rather than open sea work." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the start}} of the Test series, Yashpal Sharma, who was {{replaced}} in the national selection panel, accused Chappell of questioning his integrity and interfering with selection of the team. Following this, Chappell remarked that his spat with Ganguly was [...] "blown out of proportion" [...] and went on to say, [...] "He [...] was frustrated that he lost a job which he obviously wanted to keep. I had no part in him losing his job, but he had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> on someone.".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the extreme}} shoot {{interview}} released by Highspots in 2005, Awesome conspired that the infamous incident between Vince Russo and Hulk Hogan at Bash at the Beach 2000 {{may have been}} one of the underlying reasons as to why he was plagued by a string of unfavorable gimmicks. As a cousin of Michael Bollea, Awesome suggested that Russo may have thought that he was just [...] "too close of kin" [...] to Hogan and decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> on him. In addition, Awesome's cousin, Horace Hogan left WCW immediately after the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{explicit}} {{shots in the}} final photo slide show in which his character is seen receiving fellatio in an elevator, Galifianakis confirmed that a prosthesis {{was used for the}} scene, and that he had been more embarrassed than anyone else during the creation of the shot. [...] "You would think that I wouldn't be the one who was embarrassed; I was extremely embarrassed. I really didn't even want it in there. I offered Todd's assistant {{a lot of money to}} convince him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of the movie. I did. But it made it in there." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 18, Michelle Obama {{attracted}} criticism when {{during a}} campaign speech in Milwaukee, Wisconsin she said, [...] "Let me tell you, {{for the first}} time in my adult life, I am really proud of my country. Not just because Barack is doing well, but I think people are hungry for change." [...] Barack's response to the criticism was, [...] "Statements like this are made, and people try <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of context and make a great big deal out of it, and that isn't at all what she meant. What she meant was, this is the first time that she's been proud of the politics of America," [...] he said. [...] "Because she's pretty cynical about the political process, and with good reason, and she's not alone. But she has seen large numbers of people get involved in the process, and she's encouraged." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the album's stripped-back closing track, [...] "You Were Good", Jim Adkins stated: [...] "A {{fair amount}} of the ideas for Damage started out as {{acoustic}} songs, like really rough acoustic songs. 'You Were Good' started out in a pretty acoustic-based world and when we tried <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of that world, we realized that without the acoustic guitar in there as a bed, it didn't feel the same without it being there. With 'You Were Good', we experimented {{around a little bit}} with fleshing it out and building the dynamics of it in a full band sense, {{but at the end of}} the day we all looked at each other and agreed it sounded better with just me and a guitar and the weirdo, Indian drone thing on there." [...] Guitarist and backing vocalist Tom Linton elaborated: [...] "It was just [...] with an acoustic guitar and his vocals, and there was never a point where he stopped and started over. He just played it from the beginning to the end live. Then I overdubbed an organ part and Alain [...] played the guitar part. That was really fun to do, and I don't think we had ever done it before, especially with vocals." ...|$|E
2500|$|The League of Women Voters had {{announced}} {{a schedule of}} debates similar to 1976, three presidential and one vice presidential. No one had {{much of a problem}} with this until it was announced that Rep. John Anderson might be invited to participate along with Carter and Reagan. Carter steadfastly refused to participate with Anderson included, and Reagan refused to debate without him. It took months of negotiations for the League of Women Voters to finally put it together. It was held on September 21, 1980 in the Baltimore Convention Center. Reagan said of Carter's refusal to debate: [...] "He [...] knows that he couldn't win a debate even if it were held in the Rose Garden before an audience of Administration officials with the questions being asked by Jody Powell." [...] The League of Women Voters promised the Reagan campaign that the debate stage would feature an empty chair to represent the missing president. Carter was very upset about the planned chair stunt, and at the last minute convinced the League <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> The debate was moderated by Bill Moyers. Anderson, who many thought would handily dispatch the former Governor, managed only a draw, according to many in the media at that time. The Illinois congressman, who had been as high as 20% in some polls, and {{at the time of the}} debate was over 10%, dropped to about 5% soon after. Anderson failed to substantively engage Reagan, instead he started off by criticizing Carter: [...] "Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I. The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend," [...] to which Reagan added: [...] "It's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement." [...] In one moment in the debate, Reagan commented on a rumor that Anderson had invited Senator Ted Kennedy to be his running mate by asking the candidate directly, [...] "John, would you really prefer Teddy Kennedy to me?" ...|$|E

50|$|In 1912, {{while the}} grounds of Bay View Park were being put in order, the stone was thoughtlessly placed in a new stone wall by workmen.

5000|$|Some {{traditional}} {{characters are}} very distinct, such as electricity/lightning 電 diàn, rope 繩 shéng and turtle 龜 gūi. After the simplification process all three characters {{appear to have}} the same components even though they have no relationship at all. Respectively electricity 电, rope 绳, turtle 龟 can now conceivably be mistaken for one another, while their distinctions in the traditional forms are unmistakable. The simplification of the word electricity/lightning 電 <b>to</b> 电 also <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of the natural context. Stripped of its radical, 电 no longer bears any sense of semantic affinity with characters like snow 雪, thunder 雷, and hail 雹, themselves all untouched in the PRC simplification scheme.|$|R
