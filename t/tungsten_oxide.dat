40|$|In {{the current}} work, the {{photocatalytic}} treatment of palm oil mill effluent over <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxides</b> photocatalyst under ultraviolet-irradiation was evaluated. Characterization of fresh and used <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxides</b> photocatalyst was accomplished via X-Ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis, Ultraviolet–Visible Light Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy, and Fourier Transformed-Infrared Spectroscopy. Photocatalytic treatment of palm oil mill effluent {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of catalyst loading, longevity, and recyclability of the <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxides</b> photocatalyst, as well as the effect of pH alteration on palm oil mill effluent. During the photocatalytic reaction, the collected liquid sample was tested for chemical oxygen demand, pH, and colour intensity while the gaseous sample was analyzed via gas chromatography. The optimum catalyst loading was 0. 5 g/L, corresponds to highest photocatalytic degradation (51. 15 %) and decolourization (96. 21 %). The pH alteration on palm oil mill effluent has negligible effect on its photocatalytic degradation with UV/WO 3 system. For longevity study, the optimum reaction time was 16 h, which achieved 84. 70 % photocatalytic degradation and 98. 28 % photocatalytic decolourization. From the recyclability study, it can be concluded that the <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxides</b> photocatalyst is suitable for photocatalytic decolourization of palm oil mill effluent, but not suitable for photocatalytic degradation.

The relation between thermal treatments (calcination temperature of W-KIT- 6 composites and reductive treatment of <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxides),</b> crystalline structure and acidity has been systematically investigated. The acidity of mesoporous <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxides</b> was investigated using common pyridine adsorption methods and chemisorption of probe molecules (CO, H- 2). Combination of XRD and FTIR techniques showed that monoclinic and orthorhombic phases of crystalline wall structure coexist in the calcination temperatures 550 - 800 degrees C. Increasing the calcination temperature and decreasing the W/Si mass ratio of composites favors the transformation of orthorhombic phase to more stable monoclinic. Moreover, the acidity as well as ability to chemisorbs CO decreases when the calcination temperature increases. The concentration of acid sites also depends on the temperature of reductive treatment of tungsten oxides: CO uptakes increase twice at the 250 degrees C and decrease by four times when the temperature increases to 450 degrees C.

The effect of vanadium and <b>tungsten</b> <b>oxides</b> on the catalytic activity of sulfated Ti-pillared clay (STi-PILC) for NO reduction by ammonia was examined. Based on the temperature-programmed reduction, {{it was found}} that the sulfate stability depends on the loaded metal oxides and the reduction properties of SO 42 - or V 2 O 5 in the sample were changed in the presence of WO 3. The difference in reduction properties of sulfate strongly suggests some interaction of sulfate with tungsten and vanadia species on the surface of STi-PILC support. Vanadia enhanced the NO removal activity of STi-PILC, while no significant effect of tungsten was observed for WO 3 -V 2 O 5 /STi-PILC catalyst. When both tungsten and sulfate exist simultaneously on the surface of vanadia supported STi-PILC, the sulfate species seems to play a more important role for NO removal activity than tungsten.
