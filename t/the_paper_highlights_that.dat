40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a tolerance design {{approach for}} the feedback compensation networks of DC/DC switching regulators, identifying {{the most reliable}} solutions among different feasible alternatives that fulfil closed-loop design constraints. A voltage-mode-regulated DC/DC buck converter is considered as a case study. Given the performance and stability constraints, as tolerance ranges for crossover frequency and phase margin, feasible design solutions are sought by means of Monte Carlo and interval arithmetic computations.

40|$|Mobile {{services}} {{are a very}} important part of the e-commerce landscape. Although research has been conducted on what services people use and what value they attach to those services we know little about why people attach those perceived values. The theory of consumer value provides a theoretical framework to examine the adoption of mobile services. We use a life history research methodology to demonstrate that a biographical account can help in uncovering the “why ” of perceived value. The life histories used in <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> approach can be used to explain adoption and use of a product in relation to a person’s lifestyle, needs, and experiences. From the examples, we can see that mobile services often have a functional value attached to them at the outset but social and epistemic value can follow when people are keen to experiment and feel part of a social community of use...|$|R

In particular, <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> analyzes <b>the</b> effects of port efficiency, customs environment, regulatory environment and service sector infrastructure on the export performance of ASEAN countries using bilateral trade data from 2000 to 2001 for 69 ASEAN trading partners.

Six different project approaches are adopted to generate a set of optimal feasible project solutions by means of a joined Monte-Carlo/Interval-Analysis numerical method, according to control loop performance constraints and using commercial values and tolerances of circuit parameters. The search of the optimal feasible projects is performed with different design priorities, like minimum sensitivity of dynamic performances, maximum tolerance of designed parameters, maximum centrality of the performance indexes within the allowed tolerance range. The results presented in <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>that,</b> given a set of design constraints, the best projects fulfilling the selected priority is provided and a comparative evaluation of the robustness of different possible solution for the same design goal is allowed...|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} {{security}} policy {{seems to have}} undergone {{dramatic changes in the}} last decades. Under the broad umbrella of a turn to security governance, one can observe trends of an internationalization and privatization of security. Of these trends, one seems to stand out, that is the increasing reliance of states on private business actors in the provision of security. How do theses trends affect the state? While some believe that the provision of security by private agents is unproblematic as long as the state keeps its governmental supervision, others fear that the state is losing its capability to control the activities of private actors in the field of security, the more privatization proceeds. <b>The</b> working <b>paper,</b> firstly, provides a systematic overview on the inclusion of private business actors in the provision of security. Secondly, it will address the question of its consequences for <b>the</b> state. <b>The</b> <b>papers</b> <b>highlights</b> <b>that</b> privatization stops short of transforming the state but it is about to weaken the democratic legitimation of the use of force...|$|R
40|$|How do {{peripheral}} {{and relatively}} isolated regions innovate? Recent research {{has tended to}} {{stress the importance of}} agglomeration economies and geographical proximity as key motors of innovation. According to this research, large core areas have significant advantages with respect to peripheral areas in innovation potential. Yet, despite these trends, some remote areas of the periphery are remarkably innovative {{even in the absence of}} critical innovation masses. In this paper we examine one such case – the region of Southwest Norway – which has managed to remain innovative and dynamic, despite having a below average investment in R&D in the Norwegian context. The results of <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>that</b> innovation in Southwest Norway does not stem from agglomeration and physical proximity, but from other types of proximity, such as cognitive and organizational proximity, rooted in soft institutional arrangements. This suggests that the formation of regional hubs with strong connections to international innovative networks may be a way to overcome peripherality in order to innovate. innovation; institutions; distance; trust; open-mindedness; periphery; Norway...|$|R
