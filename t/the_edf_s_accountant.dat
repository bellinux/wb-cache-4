40|$|This paper proposes {{partitioned}} evolutionary digital filters (EDFs) {{in order}} to implement <b>the</b> <b>EDF</b> on parallel proces-sors. The execution time of <b>the</b> original <b>EDF</b> is longer {{than that of the}} LMS adaptive digital filter, since <b>the</b> <b>EDF</b> con-sists of many inner digital filters. Thus, we divide <b>the</b> orig-inal <b>EDF</b> into smaller sub-EDFs for parallel implementa-tions. In <b>the</b> partitioned <b>EDF,</b> a large population of <b>the</b> orig-inal <b>EDF</b> is divided into smaller subpopulations. Then, each sub-EDF has one subpopulation and executes the small-sized main loop of <b>the</b> original <b>EDF.</b> Numerical examples show that <b>the</b> partitioned <b>EDF</b> gives <b>the</b> same learning curves as <b>the</b> original <b>EDF</b> does in spite of dividing the original pop-ulation. 1...|$|R

The release of <b>the</b> <b>EDF</b> 8. 0 model represents a major recalibration of the model, which incorporates both a larger default dataset and improved estimation techniques that derive <b>the</b> <b>EDF</b> term structure from credit migration. <b>The</b> <b>EDF</b> 8. 0 model refines the mapping of the Distance-to-Default (DD) to <b>the</b> <b>EDF</b> level. <b>The</b> resulting <b>EDF</b> value is a superior measure of both absolute and relative risk. <b>The</b> <b>EDF</b> 8. 0 model also provides improved granularity with a wider range of EDF credit measures so that fewer credits hit the model cap and floor. These refinements meet the increased demands that market participants are placing on quantitative credit risk models.

30|$|In {{the area}} of {{scheduling}} algorithm, <b>the</b> <b>EDF</b> algorithm was originally proposed by [28] and has formed the foundation of many hybrid algorithms. <b>The</b> <b>EDF</b> algorithm {{has proven to be}} suitable for real-time traffic for both the ertPS class and the rtPS class where QoS adherence is a must. In analyzing <b>the</b> <b>EDF,</b> <b>the</b> core component of choice is based on a deadline; in specific, it is directed to acquiring the minimum deadline of the packet which is to be served first. <b>The</b> <b>EDF</b> algorithm mechanism guarantees that packets are always searched from the queue accordingly to this minimum value at time ‘t’ and is scheduled based on an ascending order. In parallel to the execution of packets in this order, the other packets waiting specially for having different deadlines are kept waiting in the queue to be served until their respective deadline order has arrived. Therefore, in <b>the</b> <b>EDF</b> algorithm, <b>the</b> absolute deadline is pursued with no other mechanism to monitor its compliance. The waiting time of the packets in the queue continuously increases, subsequently increasing the delay. These accumulation of delay may in many instances cause a breach of the stipulated deadline, as no form of monitoring is provided. The adverse effect of this would be packets being consumed by the base station for processing which have actually lost their value due to surpassing <b>the</b> deadlines. This <b>EDF</b> algorithm design has therefore limitations for packets having different deadlines which are confined to waiting extensively in the queue.|$|R

Based on this concept, it is possible to derive a necessary and sufficient feasibility condition to check whether EDF scheduling is valid for a given partitioning. <b>The</b> <b>EDF</b> norm has interesting convexity properties that permit using a Linear Programming approach to reduce the number of points at which <b>the</b> <b>EDF</b> norm needs to be checked.
