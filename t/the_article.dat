5|$|Germans viewed this clause as a {{national}} humiliation, forcing Germany to accept full responsibility for causing the war. German politicians were vocal in their opposition to <b>the</b> <b>article</b> {{in an attempt to}} generate international sympathy, while German historians worked to undermine <b>the</b> <b>article</b> with the objective of subverting the entire treaty. The Allied leaders were surprised at the German reaction; they saw <b>the</b> <b>article</b> only as a necessary legal basis to extract compensation from Germany. <b>The</b> <b>article,</b> with the signatory's name changed, was also included in the treaties signed by Germany's allies who did not view the clause with the same disdain as the Germans did. American diplomat John Foster Dullesone of the two authors of the articlelater regretted the wording used, believing it further aggravated the German people.|$|E

Since no state has approved it since 1792, ratification by an additional 27 states would now be necessary for <b>the</b> <b>article</b> to be adopted.|$|E

25|$|When Hanson {{was elected}} to Congress, Maryland was holding up the {{ratification}} of <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> of Confederation. <b>The</b> state, which {{did not have any}} claims on western land, refused to ratify <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> until <b>the</b> other states had ceded their western land claims. When the other states finally did so, the Maryland legislature decided in January 1781 to ratify <b>the</b> <b>Articles.</b> When Congress received notice of this, Hanson joined Daniel Carroll in signing <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> of Confederation on behalf of Maryland on March 1, 1781. With Maryland's endorsement, <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> officially went into effect. Many years later, some Hanson biographers claimed that Hanson had been instrumental in arranging the compromise and thus securing ratification of <b>the</b> <b>Articles,</b> but, according to historian Ralph Levering, there is no documentary evidence of Hanson's opinions or actions in resolving the controversy.|$|R
