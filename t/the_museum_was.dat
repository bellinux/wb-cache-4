This gallery featured a strengthened ground floor (to support the weight of very heavy exhibits), a first floor mezzanine and second storey viewing balcony. Into this space were placed tanks, artillery pieces, vehicles, ordnance and aircraft from the First World War to the Falklands War. For some years <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> <b>was</b> marketed as 'The new Imperial War Museum'.

5|$|In 1985, Ma was {{appointed}} the Director of the Shanghai Museum. When <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> <b>was</b> omitted from Shanghai's five-year reconstruction plan in 1992, Ma lobbied Mayor Huang Ju for its rebuilding. After seeing the dilapidated {{rooms of the}} Zhonghui Building where <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> <b>was</b> then housed, Huang agreed to allocate a prime site on the People's Square, but the museum had to raise its own building funds. Ma raised US$25 million by leasing the old building to a Hong Kong developer. He also made many trips abroad to solicit donations, mainly from the Shanghai diaspora who had fled to Hong Kong after the Communist revolution, raising another US$10 million. The money still ran short, but he eventually persuaded the city government to allocate another 140 million yuan to complete the building.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> <b>was</b> {{headed by}} Sujatmiko.

He posited this {{to be based on}} a popular view of museums as unexciting or boring places. In order to attract new visitors, the museum has {{initiated}} several competitions in 2012 and 2013, including a photography contest on the museum's Facebook page. It has also undertaken mobile exhibitions, showing some of its collection in cities such as Yogyakarta and Magelang.

The museum is now promoted as a site for educational tourism and accepts donations of materials related to the press in Indonesia.|$|E
