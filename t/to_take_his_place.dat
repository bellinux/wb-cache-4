5|$|As {{the teams}} {{prepared}} to leave their dressing rooms, Manchester City deliberately delayed their exit by a short period to play on any nerves the Leicester City players may have had. Manchester City coach Malcolm Allison was not permitted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place</b> on the bench, as he was serving a touchline ban. Instead, he had {{to sit in the}} stand behind the dugout. Before kick-off, the players were introduced to the guest of honour, Princess Anne.|$|E
5|$|During the {{timespan}} of Training Camp {{prior to}} {{the first game of}} the preseason, various transactions occurred. On the first day of camp, rookie Chad Hamilton retired, and on July 31, Tyler Moore was signed to a three-year contract <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place.</b> On August 5, tight end Brian Vogler was released. Six days later, guard Ryan Groy was traded to the New England Patriots for linebacker Matthew Wells.|$|E
5|$|It was Geoffrey Barrow's belief, {{supported}} by Donald Watt, that their decision {{was the result}} of pressure from the new Scottish king, Robert de Brus, who may have valued Balmyle's experience and trusted his political record. The usual secular patron of the diocese was the Mormaer of Strathearn, but the incumbent Maol Íosa III was at that stage a prisoner-exile at Rochester in England, thus allowing Robert <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E

5|$|Nathan {{earned his}} first save at Target Field on April 8, 2011. He emptied the {{container}} of dirt {{he took from}} the Metrodome on the mound at Target Field before pitching. On April 18, Nathan was replaced at closer by Matt Capps after going 3 for 5 in save opportunities. On May 28, 2011, Nathan {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list with a right flexor muscle strain. Chuck James was called up <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|Smith's {{replacement}} was Ron Suart, {{who wanted}} Matthews {{to stay out}} wide, and did not value his contribution {{in the way that}} Smith had done. Suart limited Matthews to 19 league appearances in 1958–59. Matthews was then used just 15 times in 1959–60, as Suart signed Arthur Kaye <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place,</b> and local lad Steve Hill also vied for the outside-right position. He enjoyed more games in 1960–61, playing 27 league games as the club narrowly avoiding relegation by the odd point.|$|E
5|$|The 1997–98 {{season was}} marked by injuries, and the team {{finished}} 41–41 with the eighth seed in the Western Conference. Houston once again faced the Jazz, {{this time in the}} first round, and they lost the series 3–2. Drexler retired after the season, and the Rockets made another bold trade to bring in Scottie Pippen <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place.</b> In the strike-shortened 1998–99 season, the Rocket went 31–19, but lost to the Lakers in the first round 3–1 of the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|The part became Hordern's first paid role as {{an actor}} for a theatre company. The play was an instant hit and ran at the People's Theatre in Mile End for two weeks. It also starred the English actor Stephen Murray in the title role, but he became contractually obliged {{elsewhere}} {{towards the end of}} the run. This allowed Hordern <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place</b> for which Daltry paid Hordern an extra £1 a week.|$|E
5|$|They {{toured the}} US in November and December, with a holiday break at the end.

5|$|When Lounsberry {{learned that}} a {{military}} column (including the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment commanded by Lt. Col.

However, {{at the last minute}} Lounsberry's wife fell ill, so the editor asked Kellogg <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place.</b> Lounsberry expected Kellogg would cover nothing more than a sensational military victory.|$|E

5|$|Drexler {{retired after}} the season, and the Rockets traded {{to bring in}} Scottie Pippen <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place.</b> In the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Rockets lost to the Lakers {{in the first round}} of the playoffs. After the 1999 draft, the Rockets traded for the second overall pick Steve Francis from the Vancouver Grizzlies, in {{exchange}} for four players and a first-round draft pick. However, after Houston traded a discontented Pippen to Portland, and Barkley suffered a career-ending injury, the rebuilt Rockets went 34–48 and missed the playoffs, for only the second time in 15 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, when {{a scandal}} forced the {{original}} Republican nominee, Godlove Stein Orth, {{to drop out}} of the gubernatorial race, Harrison accepted the Republican Party's invitation <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place</b> on the ticket. Harrison centered his campaign on economic policy and favored deflating the national currency. He was ultimately defeated in a plurality by James D. Williams, losing by 5,084 votes out of a total 434,457 cast, but Harrison was able to build on his new prominence in state politics. When the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 reached Indianapolis, he gathered a citizen militia to make a show of support for owners and management, and helped to mediate an agreement between the workers and management and to prevent the strike from widening.|$|E
5|$|In December 1943 a {{judge was}} taken ill, and Denning was asked <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place</b> as a Commissioner of Assize. This was {{regarded}} as a 'trial' for membership of the judiciary, and Denning was appointed Recorder of Plymouth on 17 February 1944. On 6 March 1944, while arguing a case in the House of Lords, Denning was taken aside by the Lord Chancellor and told that he wanted Denning to become a judge at the High Court of Justice in the Probate, Admiralty and Divorce Division. Denning accepted, and the announcement was made before the conclusion of the trial.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, the {{divisions}} in the state party proved ruinous for Randall's chances at the Speaker's chair. Instead, the Democrats decided on Michael C. Kerr of Indiana, who was elected. Randall was instead named chairman of the Appropriations Committee. In that post, he focused on reducing the government's spending, and cut the budget by $30,000,000, despite opposition from the Republican Senate. Kerr's health was fragile, and he was often absent from sessions, but Randall refused <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place</b> as speaker on a temporary basis, preferring to concentrate on his appropriations work. Kerr and Randall began to work more closely together through 1876, but Kerr died in August of that year, leaving the Speakership vacant once again.|$|E
5|$|On January 21, {{strength}} and conditioning coach Mike Clark was fired. The next day, the Broncos' Jason George was hired <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place.</b> Broncos offensive quality control coach Bo Hardegree was hired as an offensive assistant on January 24. Three days later, Chicago offensive quality control coaches Carson Walch and Brendan Nugent were fired. On February 4, Central Michigan director of {{strength and}} conditioning Rick Perry was hired as an assistant strength coach.

5|$|Rutherford {{was born}} on November 8, 1869 to James Calvin Rutherford and Leonora Strickland and raised in near-poverty in a Baptist farm family. Some sources list his place of birth as Boonville, Missouri, but {{according}} to his death certificate {{he was born in}} Versailles, Missouri. Rutherford developed an interest in law from the age of 16. Although his father discouraged this interest, he allowed Rutherford to go to college under the condition that he pay for a laborer <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place</b> on the family farm. Rutherford took out a loan and helped to pay for his law studies by working as a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman and court stenographer.|$|E

5|$|Although out {{of shape}} and with arthritic knees, Nash {{announced}} that he was making a football comeback in 1945. He sought to return to South Melbourne, rather than Camberwell, but Camberwell declined Nash's transfer application and both clubs stated that they would be naming Nash in their respective sides for Round 1. An impediment to Nash's return to South Melbourne arose as a result of Nash having played two games for his old boy scout troop, the 6th Melbourne Scouts, while on leave in mid-1942; these games were considered competitive, and playing in them meant that Nash had not sat out of football for the three years required to serve the suspension he had received for crossing to Camberwell without a clearance. After an appeal by South Melbourne, a special meeting of the VFL was held to amend the rules so ex-servicemen would not be penalised for playing in minor matches. The amendment was made the day before the commencement of the 1945 season, allowing Nash <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place</b> for South Melbourne in their Round 1.|$|E
5|$|Between {{conventions}} in April 1775, Randolph, who {{was both}} the Speaker of the House of Burgesses and President of the Virginia Conventions, negotiated with Lord Dunmore for gunpowder {{removed from the}} Williamsburg arsenal to a British warship during the Gunpowder Incident, which was a confrontation between the Governor's forces and Virginia militia, led by Patrick Henry. The House of Burgesses was called back by Lord Dunmore one last time in June 1775 to address British Prime Minister Lord North's Conciliatory Resolution. Randolph, who was a delegate to the Continental Congress, returned to Williamsburg <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place</b> as Speaker. Randolph indicated that the resolution had not {{been sent to the}} Congress (it had instead been sent to each colony individually in an attempt to divide them and bypass the Continental Congress). The House of Burgesses rejected the proposal, which was also later rejected by the Continental Congress.|$|E
5|$|Glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has {{the club}} split up into pairs to sing ballads to one another. As Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton) is absent, Will is forced <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>place</b> and sing with Rachel (Lea Michele), who develops {{a crush on}} him. Will is dismayed, remembering Suzy Pepper (Sarah Drew), the last student who had such strong feelings for him. When her feelings were not reciprocated, she was so distraught she ate an extremely hot pepper from Mexico, was hospitalized, and had to have an esophagus transplant. Rachel visits Will's apartment, where his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) puts her to work cooking and cleaning. After an encounter with Suzy Pepper, during which Suzy explains {{that the two of}} them are similar and that chasing after Will won't repair Rachel's self-esteem, Rachel realizes her feelings for Will reflect her concerns about her own self-worth, and apologizes for her behavior. Afterward, Will assures her that she will find the man of her dreams who loves her for who she is.|$|E
