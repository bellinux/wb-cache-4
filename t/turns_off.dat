Highway 82 turns eastward again, returning to its southerly heading after another mile when Spring Valley Road <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> to the Glenwood Springs campus of Colorado Mountain College in {{the mountains to the}} north. A half-mile (1km) beyond that junction, at the headquarters of the Garfield County Road and Bridge District, the highway begins a long stretch with a southerly heading.|$|E
5|$|After Peach's castle is {{sent back}} to the ground and Mario defeats Bowser, he recounts his tale to Luigi, who had {{remained}} at home while Mario went on the adventure. Peach throws a huge party to honor Mario and his allies for saving the entire kingdom, which is then followed by a parade during the credits. In the end, Mario and Peach exit their parade float and gaze up the sky, seeing fireworks. This part will not end until the player <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> the console. When restarted, the file will restart from the last save.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{the village}} limits, {{maintenance}} of NY120A shifts {{from the state}} to Westchester County, which inventories the route as CR112. Continuing on, the road narrows to two lanes ahead of Port Chester's central business district, where NY120A passes the Port Chester Public Library and the village's post office ahead of a junction with Pearl Street three blocks west of U.S. Route1 and two blocks west of the Metro-North Railroad. Here, NY120A <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> Westchester Avenue and onto North Pearl Street, becoming a village-maintained route in the process. The route's northeastward run on North Pearl Street is brief, however, as NY120A turns northwest onto King Street after just two blocks.|$|E

5|$|NY149 officially {{begins at}} exit20 on the {{northbound}} Adirondack Northway (I-87) {{in the town}} of Queensbury, from where it follows a ramp eastward to US9. As signed, however, NY149 begins at the southbound portion of I-87 exit20 and follows County Route23 (CR23, named Gurney Lane) east to US9, where it turns to follow US9 northward. The signed and official routings join at the exit's northbound ramps. While concurrent with US9, NY149 passes the Adirondack/Lake George Factory Outlet Mall and several other businesses located {{on both sides of the}} highway. At the end of the factory outlets in the hamlet of French Mountain, NY149 <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> US9 and proceeds in a generally eastward direction toward the village of Fort Ann.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{range of}} any radar system {{is due to}} its pulse width, {{the length of time}} that the {{transmitter}} is turned on before it <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> so the receiver can listen for reflections from targets. If the echo from the target is received while the transmitter is still sending, the echo will be swamped by the transmitted pulse backscattering off local sources. For instance, a radar with a pulse width of 1µs {{would not be able to}} see returns from a target less than 150m away, because the radar signal travelling at the speed of light would cover the round trip distance of 300m before that 1µs interval had passed.|$|E
5|$|After {{destroying}} his workshop, Hoffman is {{attacked and}} subdued by three pig-masked figures, {{one of whom}} is Lawrence. Flashbacks show that John Kramer found him unconscious by the steam pipe and nursed him back to health, and Lawrence has assisted him ever since. This was known only by Jill, who delivered a package to him at the hospital, a videotape in which John asked him to watch over Jill and take action if anything happened to her. To this end, Lawrence has Hoffman brought to the disused bathroom and shackled by the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence appears, throws the hacksaw he used to sever his own foot out the door, and then <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> the lights and seals the door, leaving Hoffman to die.|$|E

5|$|In Hartford, NY149 intersects both Christian Hill Road and CR23 (the {{main street}} of the community) ahead of a {{junction}} with NY40 south of the community. The two routes converge here as NY149 follows NY40 northward around the small community to a junction east of the hamlet's center, where NY149 <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> {{to the east and}} begins to pass through more rural areas of the town of Hartford and the adjacent town of Granville. Upon crossing into Granville, the open areas along the route give way to dense forests. NY149 continues generally northeastward through the town, passing through the isolated hamlet of Hillsdale before curving to the southeast toward South Granville. At the center of the community, NY149 turns to the northeast at an intersection with CR27 and CR28.|$|E
5|$|The Falcon {{journeys}} to the Rebel base at Yavin IV, {{where the}} Rebels analyze the Death Star plans {{and find a}} weakness. Luke joins the assault team while Han collects his reward for the rescue and prepares to leave. The Rebel fighters attack the Death Star but suffer heavy losses during the assault. During his run, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice telling him to use the Force, and he <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> his targeting computer. Vader appears with his own group of fighters, {{and is about to}} fire at Luke's starfighter when Han arrives in the Falcon and attacks Vader and his men, sending Vader's ship off into space. Guided by the Force, Luke fires into the port, destroying the Death Star, and he returns to the Rebel base with his friends to celebrate their victory.|$|E

To the north of the cut are the remains of the Greasbrough Canal, now culverted under the embankment of the A633 road. Eastwood lock marks the end of the Rotherham Cut, to be followed by Aldwarke Lock, {{in the shadow of the}} A6123 road bridge, and Kilnhurst flood lock, which marks the start of the Kilnhurst Cut. In Swinton, the stub of the Dearne and Dove Canal <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> to the left, and there are three more locks before the cut ends. Immediately following this, the River Dearne flows into the Don, and the towpath resumes, where the Dearne Way footpath ends.|$|E
50|$|During <b>turn</b> <b>off,</b> {{the forward}} voltage {{of the device}} must be limited until the current tails off. The limit is usually around 20% of the forward {{blocking}} voltage rating. If the voltage rises too fast at <b>turn</b> <b>off,</b> {{not all of the}} device will <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> and the GTO will fail, often explosively, due to the high voltage and current focused on {{a small portion of the}} device. Substantial snubber circuits are added around the device to limit the rise of voltage at <b>turn</b> <b>off.</b> Reseting the snubber circuit usually places a minimum on time requirement on GTO based circuits.|$|R
40|$|An {{exploratory}} study compared {{the prevalence of}} multiple types of condom-associated ‘turn offs’ in men and women. Nearly 2000 people completed a web-based questionnaire. Data were analysed from 464 {{men and women who}} reported that condoms had <b>turned</b> them <b>off</b> the last time they were used. Gender differences were not observed for the majority (9) of 15 <b>turn</b> <b>offs.</b> The most common <b>turn</b> <b>offs</b> related to loss of pleasure. For example, more than three-quarters of the men and nearly 40 % of the women reported decreased sexual sensation (P = 0. 0001). Putting on condoms was reported by 43. 2 % of the men versus 30. 2 % of the women (P = 0. 02). Smell was a relatively frequent <b>turn</b> <b>off,</b> with about one-third indicating this issue and no significant gender difference (P = 0. 32). <b>Turn</b> <b>offs</b> pertaining to arousal and orgasm were also common. Findings suggest that numerous physical and psychological condom <b>turn</b> <b>offs</b> may be experienced by men and women while using male condoms.

M-32 follows US131 {{for a half}} mile (0.8km) near the community of Elmira. As it continues farther north US131 enters the Mackinaw State Forest. Here, MDOT has calculated the lowest average daily traffic counts of all on US131: 5,114cars and 448trucks in 2009. The highway passes through rural Charlevoix County where the terrain has many rolling hills and begins to descend to Lake Michigan. As the highway enters the southern {{section of the city}} of Petoskey it runs along Spring Street passing retail establishments and the Odawa Casino, owned by the Little Traverse Bay Indian Reservation of the Odawa Indians. At the northern terminus of US131, US31 <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> Charlevoix Avenue and follows Spring Street to the north.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{lighting}} in the top spires and decoration. The first are the V-shaped lighting inserts in the steel of the building itself. Added later were groups of floodlights that are on mast arms directed back at the building. This allows {{the top of the}} building to be lit in many colors for special occasions. The tube lighting atop the building was added in 1981, although it {{had been part of the}} original design. Until 1998 the lights were turned off at 2a.m., but New York Observer columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep the lights on until 6a.m. Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of the Audubon Society's Lights Out program, wherein the building <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> its lights during bird migration seasons.|$|E
5|$|Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids {{travel to}} Mos Eisley {{to find a}} pilot {{to take them to}} Alderaan. At a local cantina they hire {{smuggler}} Han Solo (Peter) and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca (Brian), who agree to take them with their ship, the Millennium Falcon. The group is soon spotted by stormtroopers and they flee into space, evading the pursuing Star Destroyers before jumping into hyperspace. Leia is imprisoned on the Death Star, where commanding officer Grand Moff Tarkin (Adam West) has Alderaan destroyed. The Millennium Falcon exits hyperspace and is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay. Disguising themselves as stormtroopers, Han and Luke along with Chewbacca set off to rescue the captive Princess while Obi-Wan goes to shut off the tractor beam and R2 and C3PO stay behind. Han, Luke and Chewie rescue Leia, and the four dive into a garbage chute to escape stormtroopers and find a couch in the garbage masher below. As they flee the Death Star, Obi-Wan <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> the tractor beam before being confronted by Darth Vader in a lightsaber duel. Vader strikes Obi-Wan down as the others board the Falcon, taking the couch with them.|$|E
