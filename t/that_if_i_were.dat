25|$|In May 2013, Jake and Amir {{started the}} podcast If I Were You as an advice show where they take {{listener}} questions {{and try to}} answer them in a helpful but funny way. Hurwitz said <b>that</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> You was partially inspired by the NPR show Car Talk, in that their audience listens for the banter between the two hosts, not necessarily the questions themselves.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued <b>that</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> You {{is part of a}} trend of Ayckbourn's adult plays taking {{inspiration}} from his family plays (in this case, The Jollies, which also deals with the adjustments and insights of being someone else) – the first example being Improbable Fiction and its derivation from The Boy Who Fell into A Book and My Very Own Story.|$|E

She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way, and feel <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> to actually set eyes upon you, I should instantly exclaim, 'That is he!'" ...|$|E

500|$|Racism also shaped {{his lifelong}} {{paradigm}} {{as a team}} player. [...] "At that time", he has said, [...] "it was never acceptable that a black player was the best. That did not happen... My junior year in college, I had what I thought was {{the one of the}} best college seasons ever. We won 28 out of 29 games. We won the National Championship. I was the [...] at the Final Four. I was first team All American. I averaged over 20 points and over 20 rebounds, and I was the only guy in college blocking shots. So after the season was over, they had a Northern California banquet, and they picked another center as Player of the Year in Northern California. Well, that let me know <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> to accept these as the final judges of my career I would die a bitter old man." [...] So he made a conscious decision, he said, to put the team first and foremost, and not worry about individual achievements.|$|E
500|$|Santer {{said there}} were three big clues to the killer's identity, [...] "one in the Christmas Day episode, one more {{recently}} than Christmas and there's another one <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> to tell you where it was, would perhaps give it away too easily," [...] however, in a chat with Sharon Marshall shown on This Morning on 18 February 2010, he said the second clue was about halfway through the investigation and the third was [...] "on screen but not necessarily in the programme". He {{also said that the}} outcome would be [...] "surprising", [...] "satisfying" [...] and [...] "in retrospect, inevitable", adding that [...] "it makes sense". Santer confirmed the clues in an interview on the EastEnders website: on Christmas Day Stacey disappears and it is never explained why, and then reappears on Boxing Day appearing [...] "not quite with it"; Stacey is the only character still sufficiently angry enough to spit on Archie's grave at his funeral; and Stacey is the first character to feature in the Christmas Day trailers.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Trump {{changed his}} voter {{registration}} from Democrat back to Republican. [...] He seriously considered {{running for president}} as a Republican in 2012 and led in an April 2011 Rasmussen Reports survey. While considering a run, Trump emphasized China's currency manipulation and criticized the trade policies of the Barack Obama administration. [...] Additionally, he questioned the legitimacy of Obama's citizenship and birth certificate. [...] He {{decided not to run}} in May 2011, but proclaimed [...] "I maintain the strong conviction <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> to run, I would be able to win the primary and, ultimately, the general election." [...] After reports that a group in Texas was attempting to create the [...] "Make America Great Again Party" [...] with the intention of running Trump as a candidate, Trump briefly considered a 2012 Independent bid and changed his voter registration from Republican to [...] "I do not wish to enroll in a party." [...] Trump said he would run if the Republicans selected the [...] "wrong candidate." [...] Ultimately, he again decided against running. [...] Trump re-registered as a Republican in 2012 and publicly endorsed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney for president.|$|E

2500|$|Columnist Walter S. Trumbull {{wrote that}} Fitzpatrick [...] "is known, admired and {{respected}} wherever a football shoe has trod or a running spike has pressed."

2500|$|Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird met {{privately with}} Lavelle {{on a visit}} to Saigon on Dec. 8, 1971. As Lavelle later told Congress, [...] "He told me I should make a liberal {{interpretation}} of the rules of engagement in the field and not come to Washington and ask him, under the political climate, to come out with an interpretation; I should make them in the field and he would back me up. He stated <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> to make more liberal interpretations of the rules of engagement, I was not likely to be questioned by DOD for our actions....

2500|$|However, as Powell explained, Tricia's secret did {{not stay}} hidden for long. [...] "It's truly awful. It comes out because Mark is sorting out Frank's life {{insurance}} {{and the insurance}} company wants {{to see all of}} his medical notes. Tricia is nervous that Mark will find Frank had a paternity test, so she gets all his records and gives them to Mark in a sealed envelope. But Mark says he needs to add a cover letter and opens the envelope anyway. Of course he sees Frank took the test and demands to know what's going on. Mark's furious. Tricia runs away and Mark's left to deal with the hideous realisation that Chrissie's not his daughter and that his dad was a rapist. Then to make matters worse, he has to work with Chrissie, pretending everything's normal. I know <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> in his shoes, I certainly wouldn't tell her. It doesn't take much imagination to realise how devastating that kind of news would be for Chrissie. Mark loves her and, {{at the end of the}} day, that's all that counts." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{directed}} mindfulness {{so that it}} {{was keeping}} closely aware of the mind, following it to know what happens at death. Mindfulness stayed with the heart right up to the final moment when only the barest awareness remained. A feeling was present that to release that faint degree of awareness would be death. At this point, the question became whether {{it would be better for}} me to let go and allow death to take place. I felt that my heart was currently quite pure and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> to let go, I wouldn't lose because of it. Although there also remained a delicate feeling that expressed the thought that: 'rather than letting go and die, by remaining alive, I could continue to be of benefit to other people. If it were all to finish here with my death, then it could only be to my own purely personal advantage. Also, people wouldn't know the full circumstances and causes of this death. If that's the case, it's certainly better not to let myself die.' I therefore attempted to wiggle and move my hands and feet, until I came around." ...|$|E
