25|$|Following Fr. Enraght’s {{dismissal}} and his family's eviction from Holy Trinity vicarage {{by order}} of Bishop Philpott, a crowded meeting of the congregation {{was held in the}} Highgate Board School, on 28 March, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye.</b> Parishioners had taken up a collection which they gave to Fr. and Mrs. Enraght in appreciation.|$|E
25|$|For {{the last}} few months of his life Leigh Fermor {{suffered}} from a cancerous tumour, and in early June 2011 he underwent a tracheotomy in Greece. As death was close, according to local Greek friends, he expressed a wish to visit England <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> to his friends, and then return to die in Kardamyli, though it is also stated that he actually wished to die in England and be buried next to his wife.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Storybrooke, Dr. Jekyll finds the town more {{beautiful}} than they described it to him; David and Mary Margaret take him to Granny's for a meal. Emma tells Hook she loves him, with both ready to take their relationship further. Henry prepares <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> to Violet, believing she and her father, Sir Morgan, will return to Camelot. However, Violet reveals that while {{she was born in}} Camelot, her father is from Connecticut, but fell into a portal to Camelot at one point; thus they will remain in the Real World. Happy to hear this, Henry shares a kiss with Violet.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{the boys}} were busy packing up, getting ready to leave. Then came the usual jolly times just {{previous}} <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> their fellow-cadets and the teachers. The students were to scatter in all directions {{and the majority of}} them expected to have a glorious time during the summer vacation. Phil Franklin was {{to go back to the}} oil fields, to visit his father.|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} {{she went to}} Dawson Place <b>to</b> see and <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> her friend. Mary was at home, and glad to see her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then death, and {{farewell}} to all things," [...] said Godwin; [...] "nor indeed should I grieve <b>to</b> <b>say</b> them <b>good-bye.</b> But, Masouda, you run great peril. Tell me now, honestly, {{why do you}} do this?" ...|$|R
500|$|..... {{last words}} were <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> to Dr. Jukes and {{thank him for}} his kindness, and just before the white cap was pulled over his face he said, [...] "Remerciez, Madame Forget." [...] meaning [...] "thank, Ms. Forget".|$|E
500|$|Madonna has {{performed}} the song only on her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, {{where it was}} the closing song of the set list. The staging of the performances {{was inspired by the}} 1971 science fiction film, A Clockwork Orange. The shows featured an introductory verse from [...] "Family Affair" [...] by Sly and the Family Stone. Madonna wore an all-black ensemble involving a cage vest, the longline bra, skintight shorts, knee-pads and a bowler hat. Her getup was a nod to actress Liza Minnelli in the film Cabaret. The performance started with her dancers appearing on the stage, with chairs on their back. Madonna appeared in their middle and started doing push-ups on the stage. She started singing [...] "Family Affair", then midway through the song, changed to [...] "Keep It Together". During the intermediate music, Madonna and her dancers performed an intricate choreography with the chairs. At the end, all the musicians, dancers and collaborators came <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> to Madonna. The singer was left alone on stage to finish with a powerful repeat of her line [...] "Keep people together forever and ever".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1750s Elizabeth's health started to decline. She began {{to suffer a}} series of dizzy spells and refused to take the {{prescribed}} medicines. She forbade the word [...] "death" [...] in her presence. Knowing she was dying, Elizabeth used her last remaining strength to make her confession, to recite with her confessor the prayer for the dying and <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> to those few people who wished {{to be with her}} including Peter and Catherine and Counts Alexei and Kirill Razumovsky. Finally on 5 January 1762 the Empress died. She was buried in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg on 3 February 1762 after six weeks lying in state.|$|E
6000|$|... "At ten, please," [...] she answered; then paused, {{and felt}} that she had nothing more <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> She could not go. It was {{impossible}} <b>to</b> rise and <b>say</b> <b>good-bye.</b> Deronda's voice was in her ears. She must say it--she could contrive no other sentence-- ...|$|R
50|$|The next {{scene is}} the paramedics carting away Hélène's body. The son is allowed <b>to</b> <b>say</b> his <b>good-bye</b> before the cremation. He {{enters the room}} where she lies in state and masturbates exclaiming {{that he does not}} want to die as he is carried out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quashy," [...] said Lawrence, impressively, laying {{his hand}} on the negro's shoulder, [...] "get out of the way. I want to speak <b>to</b> her alone,--to <b>say</b> <b>good-bye,</b> you know, for we start early to-morrow." ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{the day of}} Padre Pio's death, mystic and Servant of God Maria Esperanza de Bianchini from Venezuela {{reported}} that he appeared {{to her in a}} vision and said, [...] "I have come <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye.</b> My time has come. It is your turn." [...] Her husband saw his wife's face transfigured into that of Padre Pio. On the following day, they learned that Padre Pio had died. Witnesses say they later saw Esperanza levitating during Mass and engaging in bilocation. Padre Domenico da Cese, a fellow Capuchin stigmatist, {{reported that}} on Sunday, September 22, 1968, he saw Padre Pio kneeling in prayer before the Holy Face of Manoppello, although it was known that Padre Pio had not left his room.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{had fallen}} in love with Jane Bridges, a girl, aged 17 who was able to tell the story 60 years {{afterwards}} to his biographers. Gordon did not declare his love until he came <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> to her before leaving for Australia on 7 August 1853. [...] "With characteristic recklessness he offered to sacrifice the passage he had taken to Australia, and all his father's plans for giving him a fresh start in life, if she would tell him not to go, or promise to be his wife, or even give him some hope." [...] This she could not do, though she liked the shy handsome boy and remembered him with affection to the end of a long life. It was the one romance of Gordon's life.|$|E
2500|$|Bradley and Brent {{separated}} from the group and walked to García's, a popular restaurant-store close to the border. Kilroy stopped at the steps of a house on Álvaro Obregón <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> to the girl from Miss Tanline. He then waited for Bill to walk towards him. Bill then ran to a nearby alley to urinate while Kilroy waited for him. By the time Bill came out and caught up {{to the other two}} near García's, Kilroy had vanished. [...] "Hey, Mark, stop fucking around", Bill said, but Kilroy was nowhere to be found. His friends searched for him for hours, even after the establishments had closed and the streets had cleared at around 4:30a.m. CT. They then crossed the border thinking Kilroy may have crossed to Brownsville and was perhaps waiting near their parked car. His friends did not find him near their car and waited a few minutes in Brownsville before heading to South Padre Island. They thought that Kilroy probably left to the hotel with someone else. They woke up the next day at the hotel and Kilroy's whereabouts were still unknown. His friends then contacted the police to report him missing.|$|E
60|$|She was always, as I say, being rescued {{and being}} borne away, and being parted, and {{reaching}} {{out her arms}} to France and <b>to</b> Spain, and <b>saying</b> <b>good-bye</b> forever <b>to</b> Valladolid or the old grey towers of Hohenbranntwein.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Here she is, Henry,' he said, with a smile. 'She {{has been}} very good; she may come again.' And then, holding {{her in his arms}} once more, he {{resigned}} her <b>to</b> Henry, <b>saying,</b> 'Not <b>good-bye,</b> Ave; we will keep my birthday together.' ...|$|R
60|$|In {{this way}} it {{happened}} that Gwendolen never reappeared at the roulette-table, but that Thursday evening left Leubronn for Brussels, and on Saturday morning arrived at Offendene, the home to which {{she and her family}} were soon <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a last <b>good-bye.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The P.L.C. Speech Day of 1929 clearly {{illustrated}} {{the degree of}} support for McQueen among parents and students. It is said that when the official party came on stage, there was no applause until McQueen appeared. Vicars, the chairman for the occasion, referred to McQueen once {{towards the end of}} the ceremony but was drowned out by cheering and clapping [...] "during which Council were a peculiar greenish hue about the face, especially Gillespie and Vicars." [...] Further, after the National Anthem was sung and the officials were about to leave the stage, Rev. William Duffy, Minister at Wollongong and a parent of a P.L.C student, stood up and asked the chairman to be seated. He said that McQueen had been wronged and what was more, he was not even allowed <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye.</b> Council subsequently rushed out quickly and locked themselves in the dining room. In the Assembly Hall all was confusion with everyone cheering, stamping their feet and shouting. The stamping continued for so long that the Hall became full of dust, making it hard to see. Eventually, Mr. Duffy was able to quieten the gathering and McQueen was able to speak. He thanked those who had helped him and added: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Sacrifice is {{the story}} of Gilthas, the weak son of Tanis Half-Elven and Laurana. [...] It begins with two elves meeting with Dalamar the Dark, a black-robed mage, gaining his help to trap Gilthas in Qualinesti that he might become a puppet ruler of the elves. [...] The scene goes to Gilthas, the {{protected}} and weak youth, who is rebellious against his parents. [...] He receives a letter from a Qualinesti Senator, Rashas, to meet him in an inn, and Gilthas runs off to do so. Tanis goes after him and discovers signs that make him believe that Gilthas was ambushed, though it is in fact not true. [...] Dalamar appears to him and Tanis is knocked out. [...] Gilthas's fate is revealed; he was met by Rashas, who rode a griffin, and taken to Qualinost, capital of the elves. [...] There, he is taken to a room where the elven Queen Alhana Starbreeze resides against her will. [...] Rashas goes to make preparation for Gilthas's coronation, and Gilthas is forced to stay in the city. [...] Dalamar reveals to Tanis that Gilthas is to be made king of the Qualinesti, and they begin to make plans. [...] Gilthas is told he will be crowned the next day. [...] Dalamar reveals to Tanis that what has transpired has destroyed the chance for a massive alliance as was planned, thanks to Rashas. [...] Alhana's servant Samar comes to rescue them, but Rashas arrives in time to stop it. [...] Samar is arrested, and Gilthas and Alhana are separated. [...] Gilthas tells Rashas he will not swear the oath to become King, but Rashas threatens to kill Alhana if he doesn't; Gilthas agrees. [...] Tanis and Dalamar, aided by magic, go to try to stop the coronation, and when Tanis commands Gilthas to take off the medallion that allows him to be King, Gilthas refuses and swears to become Speaker. [...] Dalamar and Tanis rescue Alhana, and after Dalamar escapes the pair of them are exiled from Qualinesti. [...] Tanis is sent to the border where he meets Dalamar and discovers Alhana has already gone on with Samar. [...] Gilthas appears <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> to his father, and after he does so returns to Qualinesti. [...] Tanis and Dalamar then depart.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Nothing, nothing <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> except only <b>good-bye.</b> What {{could you}} tell me that I have not told myself over and over again? Reason's gone. Thinking's gone. Now I am only sure.' She smiled shadowily. 'What peace did HE find who couldn't, perhaps, like you, face the last good-bye?' ...|$|R
50|$|They {{reach the}} {{outskirts}} of town and Hector arrives in his hot-air mobile home. He throws down a rope ladder and the Quagmires start to climb up to get inside. Officer Luciana shoots at the rope ladder with a harpoon gun, breaking the rope whilst the Baudelaires are still climbing and preventing them from continuing - they jump down <b>to</b> earth, <b>saying</b> <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> the Quagmires, who then throw their notebooks down to the orphans so they can read their research. Officer Luciana's final harpoon pierces the books, destroying and scattering many of the pages, as the hot-air mobile home heads towards the horizon.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Deeb {{was head}} of the surgery team who {{operated}} on Ronald Winans. After a failed surgery he told the assembled Winans family <b>to</b> <b>say</b> its <b>good-byes,</b> but the family asked if they could pray for Winans instead. Pastor Marvin Winans laid his hands on the surgeon's head, prayed and said, [...] "You go back and take my son off the heart-lung machine. He will live." [...] Deeb was shocked but he complied. Winans lived, and Deeb later told said that the experience had brought some spiritualism to his practice.|$|R
60|$|Too shy {{to express}} my sympathy, I turned <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> to the Colonel. He did not take my hand.|$|E
60|$|MAGGIE [not {{dissatisfied}} {{with what she}} sees]. No, John, it's a surprise visit. I just ran down <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye.</b>|$|E
6000|$|That, then, was all--yes, all! He {{turned out}} the little lamp, and groped towards the hearth. But one thing left. <b>To</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye!</b> To her, and Youth, and Passion!--to the only salve for the aching that Spring and Beauty bring--the aching for the wild, the passionate, the new, that never quite dies in a man's heart. Ah! well, sooner or later, all men had <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> to that. All men--all men! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And if I {{were you}} I would {{be thankful for}} it," [...] she said, warmly. [...] "From our point of view, at any rate, there is nothing so {{becoming}} to a man {{as the fact that}} he is a worker. Sport is an excellent thing, but I detest young men who do nothing else but shoot and hunt and loaf about. It seems to me to destroy character where work creates it. All the same, I hope you will find an opportunity to come <b>to</b> Enton and <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> us." ...|$|R
60|$|Andor drew a long breath. He seemed {{suddenly}} to wake from a long, long dream. It {{was just over}} five years ago that he had stood one morning just like this in this little garden; the late roses had not then ceased to bloom. It was {{the day before he}} had to leave Marosfalva in order to become a soldier, and he had come after Mass <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a private <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> the kind priest.|$|R
60|$|Kiss me, and <b>say</b> good-bye; <b>Good-bye,</b> {{there is}} no word <b>to</b> <b>say</b> but this, Nor any lips left for my lips to kiss, Nor any tears to shed, when these tears dry; Kiss me, and <b>say,</b> <b>good-bye.</b>|$|R

50|$|Peter feels rather {{guilty for}} leaving his mother, mostly because he {{believes}} she misses him terribly. He considers returning to live with her, but first decides {{to go back to}} the Gardens <b>to</b> <b>say</b> his last <b>good-byes.</b> Unfortunately, Peter stays too long in the Gardens, and, when he uses his second wish to go home permanently, he is devastated to learn that, in his absence, his mother has given birth to another boy she can love. Peter returns, heartbroken, to Kensington Gardens.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} {{his three}} years as Beit Memorial Research Fellow, Hayreh had to decide whether to “go back <b>to</b> India and <b>say</b> <b>good-bye</b> <b>to</b> any serious {{ophthalmic}} research for lack of facilities and funds, or stay and try to make a career in British ophthalmology. [...] He decided to stay in England and pursued a career in research, clinical ophthalmology and teaching. After spending one year as a Senior House Officer at Birmingham & Midland Eye Hospital, Hayreh returned to the Institute of Ophthalmology, University of London, in 1965, this time as Lecturer in Clinical Ophthalmology. His research at this time dealt mostly with the in vivo blood supply of the optic nerve head and glaucoma.|$|R
60|$|But {{only for}} a season. Not for ever. No, no. There is one celebrated author whom I admire very much--who has been taking leave of the public any time these ten years in his prefaces, and always comes back again when {{everybody}} is glad to see him. How can he have the heart <b>to</b> be <b>saying</b> <b>good-bye</b> so often? I believe that Bunn is affected when he blesses the people. Parting is always painful. Even the familiar bore is dear to you. I should be sorry to shake hands even with Jawkins for the last time. I think a well-constituted convict, on coming home from transportation, ought to be rather sad when he takes leave of Van Diemen's Land. When the curtain goes down on {{the last night of}} a pantomime, poor old clown must be very dismal, depend on it. Ha! with what joy he rushes forward on the evening of the 26th of December next, and says--'How are you?--Here we are!' But I am growing too sentimental:--to return to the theme.|$|R
