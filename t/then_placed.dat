5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, the Rangers again placed Brashear on waivers, {{making him}} {{eligible}} for a contract buyout. Instead of buying-out his contract, however, the Rangers traded Brashear on August 2, 2010, along with Patrick Rissmiller, to the Atlanta Thrashers in exchange for centre Todd White. Atlanta <b>then</b> <b>placed</b> Brashear on waivers and bought-out the remaining year of his contract, thus making him an unrestricted free agent.

5|$|Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen {{described}} the false chanterelle in 1781, noting both its resemblance with the true chanterelles and people's propensity to confuse them. The false chanterelle was <b>then</b> <b>placed</b> in the genus Clitocybe, {{but it was}} later observed that its forked gills and dextrinoid spores indicated a relationship to Paxillus. Genetic analysis has confirmed that {{it belongs to the}} order Boletales and is more closely related to boletes.|$|E
5|$|Broasting uses a {{pressure}} cooker {{to accelerate the}} process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in {{a pressure}} cooker. Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and <b>then</b> <b>placed</b> in the hot fat. The lid {{is placed on the}} pressure cooker, and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.|$|E

The Grand Séminaire was at the place now occupied by the garden along the rue d'Alsace-Lorraine. Part of the space was occupied by the facilities of the rack and the funicular with the time (which were revised in 1976), which leads to La Croix-Rousse.

5|$|The {{premise of}} the episode was based on three major ideas: a pyramid scheme {{involving}} body parts, a lottery in a small town, and the corporate beings assembling the destitute in Chinatown. The episode's writer, Vlaming, developed the latter two ideas and series creator Chris Carter merged all three ideas in the finalized script. The episode contained several elaborate special effects shots, most notably the scene wherein a frog bursts out of a victim's chest, which was created by using molds to create a fake human torso that was <b>then</b> <b>placed</b> over an actor.|$|E

5|$|A beach party {{takes place}} at dusk on Amity Island, where a woman named Chrissie Watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean. While {{treading}} water, she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner ruling the death a shark attack leads to Police Chief Martin Brody closing the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing it will ruin the town's summer economy. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Watkins {{was killed in a}} boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly after. A bounty is <b>then</b> <b>placed</b> on the shark, resulting in an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Watkins' remains and confirms her death was from a shark attack.|$|E

All items not considered significant to the crash were stored with similar items in large boxes. When a box was full, it was weighed {{and moved to a}} custom-built temporary structure (J-Hangar) on a discontinued runway for long-term storage. If deemed significant to the investigation, the item was documented, photographed, and kept in the active examination hangar. Particular attention was paid to any item showing heat damage, burns, or other unusual marks.|$|E
