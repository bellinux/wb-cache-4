5|$|A {{highlight}} of the series in 1959 was when the Russians allowed Moore <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Westerner to see the photographic results of the Luna 3 probe, and to show them live on air. Less successful was the transmission of the Luna 4 probe, which ran into technical difficulties and around this time Moore famously swallowed a large fly; both episodes were live and Moore had to continue regardless. He was invited to visit the Soviet Union, where he met Yuri Gagarin, {{the first man to}} journey into outer space. For the fiftieth episode of The Sky at Night, in September 1961, Moore's attempt <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to broadcast a live direct telescopic view of a planet resulted in another unintended 'comedy episode', as cloud obscured the sky.|$|E
