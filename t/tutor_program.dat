40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 44 - 46) Even with {{a dramatic}} increase in class size, fewer students attending preschool, and a higher academic achievement demand in Kindergarten, Kindergarten teachers are still expected to have all their students master the state standards. One of the easiest and most efficient ways to ensure that this mastery is met is {{through the use of a}} peer <b>tutoring</b> <b>program.</b> The peer <b>tutoring</b> <b>program</b> provides students with the opportunity to teach, model, practice, and learn with constant support from a peer thereby scaffolding an increase in understanding and skill level. 	The goal of this graduate project is to address the lack of a Kindergarten peer <b>tutoring</b> <b>program</b> using a peer tutoring teacher guide. This guide, FUNdamentals First: A Guide for Kindergarten Teachers using Peer Tutoring in the Classroom! provides teachers with step-by-step directions on how to start, train, monitor, and assess a peer <b>tutoring</b> <b>program</b> with their own Kindergarten students. Resources are also available for teachers to use during tutoring sessions. With the use of the peer <b>tutoring</b> <b>program,</b> students can achieve mastery at a much quicker pace while interacting with peers in a safe, organized, exciting way...|$|R

Common tools include chat, whiteboard, web conferencing, teleconferencing and other specialized applets which {{make it easier to}} convey information back and forth. For example, there are specialized applets designed specifically for mathematics which allow the use of mathematical symbols. There is also an example-tracing <b>tutor</b> <b>program</b> that uses a behavior graph. The tutor is able to create an outline program that works a specific problem step by step. The process is activated once the student selects that problem. This is helpful for those who need help but are not able to meet face to face with someone.|$|E

Previous online adult education {{researchers have found}} {{no significant differences between}} traditional and online learning outcomes. However, little research has been done with regard to online General Educational Development (GED) -level learning for adults. The purpose of this quantitative study was to explore the effect of the Skills <b>Tutor</b> <b>program</b> compared with traditional learning on GED student achievement in reading/language arts. The Skills <b>Tutor</b> <b>program</b> was used as a means to address the low GED graduation rates at an adult education program through Memphis City Schools. This research was based on the constructivist learning theory. The research question examined the effect of an online skills program on English/language arts scores among GED students. Scores from the pretests and posttests of 40 adult education students were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to determine statistical differences between 2 groups. One group (n = 20) received the intervention of the online skills program, Skills Tutor, along with traditional instruction, whereas the other group (n = 20) received traditional instruction delivered by the teacher only. The results indicated the traditional group 2 ̆ 7 s adjusted mean scores were significantly higher than the Skills Tutor group scores. Recommendations included additional research with larger samples of students, for a longer period, and focused on the fidelity of implementing of the Skills <b>Tutor</b> <b>program</b> at the local site. Implications for positive social change include providing research findings to the local administration on the current GED program and recommendations for continued research on the instruction that best supports adult learning...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an action {{research}} project involving the redesign, implementation {{and evaluation of}} a peer <b>tutor</b> <b>program</b> in a first year design studio in higher education. The effectiveness of the revised program, particularly its capacity to support learning for commencing students in the environment of a creative studio, is examined through focus groups with first year students and third year peer tutors. The study suggests that peer tutors play {{a pivotal role in}} the studio that is different from, but complementary to, the role of the studio tutor. When employed purposefully, peer tutors can make a significant contribution {{to the development of a}} positive studio culture and the enhancement of a collaborative community of practice, and amplify students’ engagement with iterative processes of design learning. Results are discussed in relation to current theories about what constitutes a successful peer <b>tutor</b> <b>program,</b> growing evidence of the unique role played by peer tutors in design and other practice-based disciplines, and the potential contribution of peer tutors to the development of creative skills valued in 21 st century design practice...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: One of {{the chief}} {{difficulties}} in designing effective courseware for improving writing proficiency is that composing, like other forms of human communication, is a complex social process {{with little or no}} agreement as to its precise nature or structure. Designing a versatile writing <b>tutor</b> <b>program</b> which will mimic the functions performed by a human tutor requires a systematic investigation into the complex processes involved in composing, in particular its commonalities and variables, {{and the ways in which}} it is shaped to the various contexts in which it occurs. This paper suggests that in order to translate complex social processes effectively into educational software design, it is first advisable to discover the social mechanisms which effect the process. In the case of written composition, a complex modelling procedure was followed which used a process of reverse engineering to arrive at a system of essential communicative functions. The architecture of functions thus revealed validated a practical model of composing, which in turn could be seen to constitute a stochastic algorithm for composing. The algorithm was used as the basis for the design of a writing <b>tutor</b> <b>program,</b> which took the form of a help menu based around the five stages of composing depicted in the algorithm. The program has still to be tested out by learner writers working in various educational contexts. 1...|$|E
