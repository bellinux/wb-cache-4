The focus on renewable energy has {{over the past few}} decades intensified greatly. This thesis contributes to the research on developing renewable energy technologies, within the wind power, wave power and marine current power projects at the division of Electricity, Uppsala University. In this thesis grid connection of permanent magnet generator based renewable energy sources is evaluated. A <b>tap</b> <b>transformer</b> based grid connection system has been constructed and experimentally evaluated for a vertical axis wind turbine. Full range variable speed operation of the turbine is enabled by using the different step-up ratios of a <b>tap</b> <b>transformer.</b> This removes the need for a DC/DC step or an active rectifier on the generator side of the full frequency converter and thereby reduces system complexity. Experiments and simulations of the system for variable speed operation are done and efficiency and harmonic content are evaluated.   The work presented in the thesis has also contributed to the design, construction and evaluation of a full-scale offshore marine substation for wave power intended to grid connect a farm of wave energy converters. The function of the marine substation has been experimentally tested and the substation is ready for deployment. Results from the system verification are presented. Special focus is on the transformer losses and transformer in-rush currents. A control and grid connection system for a vertical axis marine current energy converter has been designed and constructed. The grid connection is done with a back-to-back 2 L- 3 L system with a three level cascaded H-bridge converter grid side.

40|$|AbstractThe {{measurement}} of power factor (PF) in electrical utility grids is a mainstay of load balancing and is also a critical element of transmission and distribution efficiency. The {{measurement of}} PF {{dates back to the}} earliest periods of electrical power distribution to public grids. In the wide-area distribution grid, measurement of current waveforms is trivial and may be accomplished at any point in the grid using a current <b>tap</b> <b>transformer.</b> However, voltage measurement requires reference to ground and so is more problematic and measurements are normally constrained to points that have ready and easy access to a ground source. We present two mathematical analysis methods based on kriging and linear least square estimation (LLSE) (regression) to derive PF at nodes with unknown voltages that are within a perimeter of sample nodes with ground reference across a selected power grid. Our results indicate an error average of 1. 884 % that is within acceptable tolerances for PF measurements that are used in load balancing tasks...|$|E
40|$|Voltage {{stability}} {{evaluation is}} {{needed to get the}} information of electrical power distribution system performance. Power flow calculation is used to determine the important parameters of power system in a steady state. An electric power system must have voltage value that does not exceed the limits of tolerance and the power loss as well as small. The improvement of voltage profile can be done by using voltage-control equipments, such as capacitor banks and transformer tap. Through simulation using the PowerWorld simulator, the value and location of capacitor banks and transformers tap will obtained in order to improve system performace. Sumbar electrical system was used in this study. From the simulation results, for the initial condition of the system, there are several buses that have voltage drop with total system losses 14. 4 MW. After capacitor added, the system voltage has increased significantly so that no one passed the value of tolerance and the losses in the system down to 14. 1 MW. As for setting the ratio of <b>tap</b> <b>transformer,</b> voltage system did not change so much, except on the secondary side of the transformer bus arranged with system losses almost the same that equal to 14. 4 MW. For the case of the addition of the capacitor and transformer tap settings in the same time, the voltage drop no longer exceeds 5 % and the total system losses decreased to 13. 9 MW...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} determine the optimal daily generation scheduling in a competitive en-vironment taking into account dispatch constraints (power reserve, ramp rate limits, real and reactive power output li-mits), network and power system security constraints (real and reactive power ow equations, bus voltages and trans-mission ow limits in pre and post-contingency states). The proposed approach considers Benders decomposi-tion for solving the security-constrained optimal generation scheduling problem. It has been developed using market al-gorithm applied to a `Single System Operator ' Model which considers the daily market and the technical constraints re-solution process as a single one. The objective function mi-nimizes the energy purchase cost subject to previously de-ned constraints, in a market where all available generating units must make energy bids arranged in different blocks with their own price. As {{a result of the}} optimization process, the on/off status of the generating units and voltage control devices, the active and reactive power output of each genera-ting unit and the <b>tap</b> <b>transformer</b> value are provided. Mathematically the power scheduling is dened as a non-linear mixed-integer optimization problem with linear objec-tive function, binary decision variables (on/off status of the generating units, reactors and capacitors), continuous varia-bles for the operation processes, time couplings (ramp rate li-mits and minimum up/down time) and non-linear constraints as complete ow load equations. The model has been tested in different cases of the IEEE 24 -bus Reliability Test System and an adapted IEEE 118 -bus Test System. It has been programmed in GAMS mathemati-cal modelling language, using CONOPT and CPLEX solvers for non-linear and linear mixed-integer programming pro-blems, respectively...|$|E
