These early vinifera plantings didn't survive in the rich-soil that they Concords were planted and soon Sauer began looking at the steep hills with poorer soils. In 1973, when a friend had a buyer back out at the last minutes on Cabernet Sauvignon cuttings, Sauer took the cuttings and planted 3 acres even though he didn't know at the time if Cabernet Sauvignon was a white wine grape or a red wine grape. During this same time, Sauer was working with Dr. Walter Clore of the WSU extension and research facility in Prosser to plant an experimental vineyard of grapes like Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer, Riesling and other varieties <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> of grapes could survive the cold Yakima Valley winters and grow to full ripeness.|$|E
25|$|The film {{rights were}} picked up by Rogue Pictures in 2006, with the remake being the first film {{produced}} by Wes Craven's new production studio Midnight Pictures. Craven, who wrote and directed the 1972 original, was interested <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> of film could be produced on a large budget, as the limited funds in 1972 forced him to eliminate scenes {{he had wanted to}} film to tell a complete story. Alleca's original script included elements of the supernatural, which prompted the studio to reject it and bring in Ellsworth to perform a rewrite. One of the elements director Iliadis wanted to avoid with this film, given its graphic nature, was turning it into torture porn — a subgenre of horror popularized by the Saw franchise. For Craven and Iliadis, The Last House on the Left primarily illustrates how even the most normal of families can be driven to evil acts if pushed too far.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the short-range repulsion {{given by the}} quark cluster model employing an inverse scattering problem. We find that the local potential which reproduces the same phase shifts to those given by the quark cluster model has a strong repulsion at short distances in the NN 1 s 0 channel. There, however, appears an attractive pocket at very short distances due to a rather weak repulsive behavior at very high energy region. This repulsion-attractive-pocket structure becomes more manifest in the channel which has an almost forbidden state, SigmaN(T= 3 / 2) 3 s 1. In order <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> of effects are important to reproduce the short-range repulsion in the quark cluster model, {{we investigate}} the contribution coming from the one-gluon-exchange potential and the normalization separately. It is clarified that the gluon exchange constructs the short-range repulsion in the NN 1 s 0 while the quark Pauli-blocking effect governs the feature of the repulsive behavior in the SigmaN(T= 3 / 2) 3 s 1 channel.

40|$|In {{studies of}} {{macromolecular}} dynamics {{it is often}} desirable to analyze complex motions {{in terms of a}} small number of coordinates. Only for simple types of mo-tion, e. g. rigid-body motions, these coordinates can be easily constructed from the Cartesian atomic coordinates. This article presents an approach that is ap-plicable to infinitesimal or approximately infinitesimal motions, e. g. Cartesian velocities, normal modes, or atomic fluctuations. The basic idea is to character-ize the subspace of interesting motions by a set of (possibly linearly dependent) vectors describing elementary displacements, and then project the dynamics onto this subspace. Often the elementary displacements can be found by physical intu-ition. The restriction to small displacements facilitates the study of complicated coupled motions and permits the construction of collective-motion subspaces that do not correspond to any set of generalized coordinates. As an example for this technique, we analyze the low-frequency normal modes of proteins up to ≈ 20 THz (600 cm− 1) in order <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> of motions occupy which frequency range. This kind of analysis is useful for the interpreta-tion of spectroscopic measurements on proteins, e. g. inelastic neutron scattering experiments.
