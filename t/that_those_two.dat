5|$|If two of {{the three}} given circles do not intersect, a center of {{inversion}} can be chosen so <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> given circles become concentric. Under this inversion, the solution circles must fall within the annulus between the two concentric circles. Therefore, they belong to two one-parameter families. In the first family (Figure7), the solutions do not enclose the inner concentric circle, but rather revolve like ball bearings in the annulus. In the second family (Figure8), the solution circles enclose the inner concentric circle. There are generally four solutions for each family, yielding eight possible solutions, consistent with the algebraic solution.|$|E

On the B side of the draw, Armagh had not met either of the teams {{and were able to}} play either Donegal or Dublin, but Monaghan's earlier game with Donegal meant <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> teams were kept apart, again making a draw unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|Ockeghem {{probably}} {{studied with}} Gilles Binchois, {{and at least}} was closely associated {{with him at the}} Burgundian court. Since Antoine Busnois wrote a motet in honor of Ockeghem sometime before 1467, it is probable <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> were acquainted as well; and writers of the time often link Dufay, Busnois and Ockeghem. Although Ockeghem's musical style differs considerably from that of the older generation, it is probable that he acquired his basic technique from them, and as such {{can be seen as a}} direct link from the Burgundian style to the next generation of Netherlanders, such as Obrecht and Josquin.|$|E
25|$|The Carrington service had, as its competitor, a horse {{bus service}} {{operated}} by Messrs Andrews of Carrington. When this firm went bankrupt, in 1888, the Tramway Company bought {{four of their}} horse buses and converted them to tram cars. In 1891 two of the converted buses were scrapped, as was car No.19, which was an 1881 Starbuck single deck design, converted to double deck in 1885. The other two converted horse buses were renumbered, and four further new cars were obtained. From G.F.

25|$|In a cafe, Ferrando and Guglielmo (two officers) express {{certainty}} that their fiancées (Dorabella and Fiordiligi, respectively) will be eternally faithful. Don Alfonso expresses skepticism and claims {{that there is}} no such thing as a faithful woman. He lays a wager with the two officers, claiming he can prove in a day's time <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>two,</b> like all women, are fickle. The wager is accepted: the two officers will pretend to have been called off to war; soon thereafter they will return in disguise and each attempt to seduce the other's lover. The scene shifts to the two women, who are praising their men (duet: Ah guarda sorella—"Ah look sister"). Alfonso arrives to announce the bad news: the officers have been called off to war. Ferrando and Guglielmo arrive, brokenhearted, and bid farewell (quintet: Sento, o Dio, che questo piede è restio—"I feel, oh God, that my foot is reluctant"). As the boat with the men sails off to sea, Alfonso and the sisters wish them safe travel (trio: Soave sia il vento—"May the wind be gentle"). Alfonso, left alone, gloatingly predicts that the women (like all women) will prove unfaithful (arioso: Oh, poverini, per femmina giocare cento zecchini?—"Oh, poor little ones, to wager 100 sequins on a woman").|$|E

40|$|This article {{explains}} why the Nollan/Dolan test should not apply to legislatively imposed exactions, provided that such exactions satisfy two key criteria: (1) the exaction is generally-applied; and (2) the exaction is applied based on a set legislative formula without any meaningful administrative discretion in that application. Legislative exactions that fail to meet <b>those</b> <b>two</b> criteria should be governed by the Nollan/Dolan standard of review {{in the same manner}} as the ad hoc adjudicative exaction in Koontz. Furthermore, legislative exactions <b>that</b> satisfy <b>those</b> <b>two</b> criteria also should not be governed by the factored analysis in Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City. Instead, a “reasonable relationship” test should be applied to legislative exactions <b>that</b> satisfy <b>those</b> <b>two</b> criteria. Part II of this Article discusses the constitutional rationales that guided the Court in reaching its decision in Koontz regarding adjudicative monetary exactions. Part III examines how those rationales, as well as the arguments raised by the Koontz dissent, demonstrate that Nollan/Dolan should not govern legislative exactions that are generally-applied and provide no meaningful discretion to administrators. Part IV {{explains why}} the Penn Central factored analysis also should not govern legislative exactions <b>that</b> meet <b>those</b> <b>two</b> criteria. Part V demonstrates why a reasonable relationship test that has been employed in various forms by state courts should govern legislative exactions <b>that</b> satisfy <b>those</b> <b>two</b> criteria. Applying <b>that</b> reasonable relationship test to qualifying legislative exactions lessens judicial interference with local land use decisions, reinforces the constitutional rationale in Koontz that development projects should pay for the external costs they create, and addresses the concern of property owners that some generally-applied legislative exactions may “go too far. ...|$|R

A recurring theme, especially in children's dinosaur books, is a climactic showdown or battle between Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus. In 1942, Charles R. Knight painted a mural incorporating a confrontation between the two dinosaurs in the Field Museum of Natural History for the National Geographic Society, establishing them as enemies in popular thought. Paleontologist Bob Bakker said of the imagined rivalry between Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops, [...] "No matchup between predator and prey has ever been more dramatic. It's somehow fitting <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> massive antagonists lived out their co-evolutionary belligerence through the very {{last days of the}} very last epoch of the Age of Dinosaurs." ...|$|E
500|$|It is {{now known}} by direct {{observation}} {{that much of the}} light curve (the graph of luminosity as a function of time) after the occurrence of a Type II Supernova, such as SN 1987A, is explained by those predicted radioactive decays. Although the luminous emission consists of optical photons, it is the radioactive power absorbed by the ejected gases that keeps the remnant hot enough to radiate light. The radioactive decay of 56Ni through its daughters 56Co to 56Fe produces gamma-ray photons, primarily of 847keV and 1238keV, that are absorbed and dominate the heating and thus the luminosity of the ejecta at intermediate times (several weeks) to late times (several months). Energy for the peak of the light curve of SN1987A was provided by the decay of 56Ni to 56Co (half life 6 days) while energy for the later light curve in particular fit very closely with the 77.3 day half-life of 56Co decaying to 56Fe. Later measurements by space gamma-ray telescopes of the small fraction of the 56Co [...] and 57Co gamma rays that escaped the SN 1987A remnant without absorption confirmed earlier predictions <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> radioactive nuclei were the power sources.|$|E

2500|$|The Westchester County {{cities of}} Yonkers and Mount Vernon {{directly}} border {{the northern part}} of the Bronx and share much of that borough's heavily urbanized character. In 1894, the voters of Yonkers and Mount Vernon, along with voters in other parts of southern Westchester, took part in a referendum to determine if they wanted to become part of New York City, along with the voters in Kings, Queens and Richmond Counties (today's Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island, respectively). At that time, the city consisted only of Manhattan and a portion of the present-day Bronx, which had been part of Westchester until it became part of New York City in 1874. While the results of the 1894 vote were positive elsewhere, including in several other adjacent sections of Westchester, which were then annexed to the city and which thus became part of the new borough of the Bronx, the returns were so negative in Yonkers and Mount Vernon <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>two</b> areas were not included in the consolidated city and remained independent municipalities. A subway connection was planned between Getty Square in downtown Yonkers and the New York City Subway, but the project was abandoned after the failed merger vote.
