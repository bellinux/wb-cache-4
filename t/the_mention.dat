The Ebers papyrus, which is the main source for information on ancient Egyptian medicine, also seems to date to this time (<b>the</b> <b>mention</b> of the Heliacal rise of Sothis by which the early New Kingdom chronology is usually calculated was found on the back of this document).|$|E

The Prologue begins with a quote from Cervantes' Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda (Persiles and Sigismunda), which is subsequently mentioned, with a focus on the character of Rutilio. <b>The</b> <b>mention</b> of Rutilio is noteworthy, as the episode has been of interest to critics due to its magical subject matter, concerning lycanthropy. Both works feature a distant and exotic land where the marvellous is present by means of metamorphoses, and viewed from the characters' perspective.|$|E

The head was evidently blue, and in 2007, Hume suggested the beak may have been red, {{and the rest of the}} plumage greyish or blackish, which also occurs in other members of Psittaculini.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{consider the}} figures of Gullveig/Heiðr and Freyja the same.

5|$|According to the NPD Group, Brütal Legend sold {{approximately}} 215,000 {{copies in}} the United States in October 2009, with about 150,000 copies being for the Xbox 360 platform, {{making it the}} 12th-top-selling game in that month. These numbers were {{not considered to be}} strong, and were attributed to the difficult marketing of the game, which emphasized Jack Black's involvement and the heavy metal nature of the game, but did not assert what the gameplay would actually be like, with the possibility that <b>the</b> <b>mention</b> of the RTS elements of the game would have possibly driven more players away from the game. In an interview in February 2011, Schafer claimed that the game had sold over 1.4 million copies. According to data collected through Nielsen SoundScan, some songs contained within Brütal Legends soundtrack saw digital sales increases of up to 700% following the game's release, similar to the effects of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, though impact on overall sales of these songs was rather small.|$|E
5|$|Although Wigan is not {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Book, possibly because it was included in the Neweton barony (now Newton-le-Willows), it is thought that <b>the</b> <b>mention</b> of a church in the manor of Neweton is Wigan Parish Church. The rectors of the parish church were lords of the manor of Wigan, a sub-manor of Neweton, until the 19th century. Wigan was incorporated as a borough in 1246 following the issue of a charter by King Henry III to John Maunsell, the local church rector and lord of the manor. The borough was later granted another charter in 1257–1258, allowing the lord of the manor to hold a market on every Monday and two annual fairs. The town is recorded on the earliest-surviving map of Britain, the Gough Map made around 1360 which highlights its position on the main western north-south highway with distance markers to Preston and Warrington.|$|E

5|$|Ecgbert {{wrote the}} Dialogus ecclesiasticae institutionis, {{which was a}} legal code for the clergy, setting forth the proper {{procedures}} for many clerical and ecclesiastical issues including weregild for clerics, entrance to clerical orders, deposition from the clergy, criminal monks, clerics in court, and other matters. It survives as one complete manuscript, with a few excerpts in other manuscripts. Because Ecgbert was the senior archbishop in England {{after the death of}} Nothhelm in 739, {{it is possible that the}} Dialogus was intended not just for the Northumbrian church but for the entire church in England. The Dialogus details a code of conduct for the clergy and how the clergy was to behave in society. The exact date it was composed is unclear, but it was probably after 735, based on <b>the</b> <b>mention</b> of the archiepiscopal status of Ecgbert in one title as well as the internal evidence of the work. The historian Simon Coates saw the Dialogus as not especially exalting monks above the laity.|$|E
5|$|Hans-Martin Schenke, {{starting}} from {{an analysis of}} , in which Jesus encounters a Samaritan woman at the town Sychar, made an extensive analysis of the ancient sources, together with {{an examination of the}} site. The curiosity of the Gospel text for scholars lies in <b>the</b> <b>mention</b> of an otherwise unattested town in the field, and the failure of the text to refer to Joseph's Tomb, despite mentioning the field Jacob allotted to Joseph, and Jacob's well. In Schenke's view, {{from the beginning of the}} Hellenistic period down to the 1st century CE, when the author of John's gospel was presumably writing, the grave commemorating Joseph stood by Jacob's Well. This grave was shifted, together with the sacred tree and Jacob's field, sometime between that date and the earliest testimony we have in the Bordeaux itinerary in 333 CE., which locates it elsewhere, by Shechem/Tel Balāṭa.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, at the {{direction}} of the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, Senator David Feeney, the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal opened an inquiry into thirteen cases of unresolved recognition for past acts of gallantry. Among the group were eleven naval personnel, including Sheean. Known as the 'Valour Inquiry', the Tribunal was directed to determine if the individuals were unduly overlooked for recognition {{at the time of their}} actions and, if so, whether retrospective awards were appropriate. The inquiry lasted two years and witnessed 166 written submissions from the public, before the Tribunal reported its findings in January 2013. In the case of Sheean, the Tribunal found that there was no manifest injustice with the award of <b>the</b> <b>Mention</b> in Despatches, and that there was no new evidence to support the reconsideration of Sheean for a Victoria Cross for Australia. If Sheean had lived, they reported, he might have been recommended for either the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal or the Distinguished Service Medal instead, but neither medal could be awarded posthumously in 1942. The Tribunal did recommend that the RAN perpetuate the use of Sheean as the name of a major combatant vessel.|$|E
5|$|On 6 April 1960, Heffron {{attempted}} {{to send the}} bill back to the council, which returned it to the assembly on the same grounds as before. As {{a result of the}} deadlock, Heffron requested the Governor to order a joint session of parliament on 20 April, a session which lasted two hours and was boycotted by the opposition. On 12 May the Assembly resolved that the bill be submitted for a referendum. However, later that day the leader of the opposition in the Legislative Council, Hector Clayton, started legal action against the government on the grounds that under section 5B of the NSW Constitution, the council had neither voted nor deliberated on the bill and thus the bill could not be submitted for a referendum. In the case of Clayton v. Heffron (1960) a majority of the full bench of the Supreme Court of New South Wales (headed by Chief Justice Evatt) found in favour of the government four to one {{on the grounds that they}} had complied fully with the intention of section 5B, while also denying the plaintiff leave to appeal to the High Court. The subsequent appeal to the New South Wales Court of Appeal was rejected by Chief Judge in Equity McLelland on 10 October. In a subsequent case to the High Court, Clayton argued that section 15 of the Commonwealth Constitution, which dealt with the process by which state parliaments filled senate vacancies, entrenched the requirement for such parliaments to be bicameral on account of its exclusive mention of both houses. This was rejected by the court that affirmed that <b>the</b> <b>mention</b> did not exclude the right of state parliaments to do as they saw fit regarding abolition or reform.|$|E
