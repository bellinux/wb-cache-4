5|$|Aspiration {{may also}} be {{considered}} in secondary pneumothorax of moderate size (air rim 1–2cm) without breathlessness, with the difference that ongoing observation in hospital is required even after a successful procedure.

Moderately sized iatrogenic traumatic pneumothoraces (due to medical procedures) may initially be <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> aspiration.|$|E

For oral administration the toxicity is lower; a study with rats yielded a LD50 after seven days of 940mg/kg.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} site of {{recurrence}} {{is in the}} vagina; vaginal relapses of endometrial cancer have the best prognosis. If relapse occurs from a cancer {{that has not been}} <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> radiation, EBRT is the first-line treatment and is often successful. If a cancer <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> radiation recurs, pelvic exenteration is the only option for curative treatment. Palliative chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and radiation are also performed. Radiation therapy (VBT and EBRT) for a local vaginal recurrence has a 50% five-year survival rate. Pelvic recurrences are <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> surgery and radiation, and abdominal recurrences are <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> radiation and, if possible, chemotherapy. Other common recurrence sites are the pelvic lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes, peritoneum (28% of recurrences), and lungs, though recurrences can also occur in the brain (<1%), liver (7%), adrenal glands (1%), bones (4–7%; typically the axial skeleton), lymph nodes outside the abdomen (0.4–1%), spleen, and muscle/soft tissue (2–6%).|$|E
