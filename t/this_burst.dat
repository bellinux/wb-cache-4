5|$|Prior to <b>this</b> <b>burst,</b> astronomers had {{not reached}} {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Although the isotropic distribution of bursts suggested {{that they do not}} occur within the disk of the Milky Way, some astronomers supported the idea that they occur within the Milky Way's halo, concluding that the bursts are visibly faint because they are not highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and that they can be detected because they are extremely energetic. The distance measurement and the calculations of the burst's total energy release unequivocally supported the latter theory, effectively ending the debate.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the very}} faint {{luminosity}} of this galaxy, its exact distance was not measured for several years. Well before then, another major breakthrough occurred with the next event registered by BeppoSAX, GRB 970508. This event was localized within four hours of its discovery, allowing research teams to begin making observations much sooner than any previous burst. The spectrum of the object revealed a redshift of z=0.835, placing the burst {{at a distance of}} roughly 6 billionlight years from Earth. This was the first accurate determination of the distance to a GRB, and together with the discovery of the host galaxy of 970228 proved that GRBs occur in extremely distant galaxies. Within a few months, the controversy about the distance scale ended: GRBs were extragalactic events originating within faint galaxies at enormous distances. The following year, GRB 980425 was followed within a day by a bright supernova (SN 1998bw), coincident in location, indicating a clear connection between GRBs and the deaths of very massive stars. <b>This</b> <b>burst</b> provided the first strong clue {{about the nature of the}} systems that produce GRBs.|$|E

We suggest that the modulatory rhythm for <b>this</b> complex <b>bursting</b> pattern is due to oscillations in glycolysis, while the bursting itself is generated by some other slow process.

25|$|Previous to <b>this</b> <b>burst,</b> {{there had}} not yet been any {{concrete}} evidence linking gamma-ray bursts to supernovae, though it had long been hypothesized that the two phenomena were results of the same type of event. The spectrum of GRB 011211 was reported to include emission lines associated with the chemical elements magnesium, silicon, sulphur, argon, and calcium, which supported the theory that gamma-ray bursts are preceded by highly massive stars undergoing a supernova collapse. However, these results were considered statistically insignificant and somewhat controversial due to the low resolution of the instruments used. The spectrum of GRB 020813 was also found to display emission lines of elements associated with supernovae, in this case sulphur and silicon. This evidence confirmed the connection between supernovae and gamma-ray bursts.|$|E

2500|$|<b>This</b> <b>burst</b> of {{what has}} {{sometimes}} been termed [...] "social republicanism" [...] expired in the mid-1930s. In 1931 Saor Éire had quickly collapsed due to the combination of fierce reaction from the Catholic Church, deeply hostile to anything that appeared communist, and repressive legislation immediately introduced by the government.

The Congress itself also split and collapsed after its first general meeting in 1935. From the debacle of the Republican Congress until it took a leftward turn again in the 1960s, the IRA would be inspired primarily by a conservative, strictly nationalist political outlook.|$|E
