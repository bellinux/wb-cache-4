5|$|The Seventh Amendment {{guarantees}} jury {{trials in}} federal civil cases {{that deal with}} claims of more than <b>twenty</b> <b>dollars.</b> It also prohibits judges from overruling findings of fact by juries in federal civil trials.

5|$|On June 5, {{the party}} was spotted by a federal steamer, but {{convinced}} the crew they were hunters scavenging the coast. Two days later, they encountered a larger boat with a mast and rigging; chasing it down, they disarmed the occupants and hijacked the craft. As compensation, they gave their old boat and <b>twenty</b> <b>dollars</b> in gold to {{the owners of the}} larger craft, and returned some of their weapons after the exchange was complete. With this more seaworthy craft, they decided to flee to Cuba. Departing from Fort Dallas, they survived an encounter with pirates, two significant storms, and a dangerous lack of provisions before arriving in the city of CÃ¡rdenas on June 11, 1865. A Kentuckian then living in the city recognized Breckinridge, introduced him to the locals, and served as his interpreter. The refugees were given food and stayed the night in a local hotel. The next morning, they traveled by rail to Havana, where Breckinridge was offered a house. He declined the offer, choosing to travel with Charles J. Helm, a fellow Kentuckian who had been operating as a Confederate agent in the Caribbean, to Great Britain.|$|E

25|$|In the Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance (1959), the {{investigators}} Festinger and Merrill Carlsmith {{asked students to}} spend an hour doing tedious tasks; e.g. turning pegs a quarter-turn, at fixed intervals. The tasks were designed to induce a strong, negative, mental attitude in the subjects. Once the subjects had done the tasks, the experimenters asked one group of subjects to speak with another subject (an actor), and persuade that impostor-subject that the tedious tasks were interesting and engaging. One group of subjects were paid <b>twenty</b> <b>dollars</b> ($20); a second group were paid one dollar ($1); and the control group were not asked {{to speak with the}} imposter-subject.|$|E

In 1938, Santos {{was working at the}} Cuban Casino Cabaret in Manhattan, which was normally visited by Puerto Ricans and other Latinos. His chores included singing, waiting on tables and on occasions he was the master of ceremonies for which he was paid a salary of thirty dollars.

2500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the study, when asked to rate the tedious tasks, the subjects of the second group (paid $1) rated the tasks more positively than did the subjects in the first group (paid $20) and than did the subjects of the control group; the responses of the paid subjects were evidence of cognitive dissonance. The researchers, Festinger and Carlsmith, proposed that the subjects experienced dissonance, between the conflicting cognitions: [...] "I told someone that the task was interesting." [...] and [...] "I actually found it boring." [...] Moreover, the subjects paid one-dollar were induced to comply; compelled to internalize the [...] "interesting task" [...] mental attitude, because they had no other justification. The subjects paid <b>twenty</b> <b>dollars</b> were induced to comply by way of an obvious, external justification for internalizing the [...] "interesting task" [...] mental attitude, thus, they experienced a lesser degree of cognitive dissonance.|$|E
