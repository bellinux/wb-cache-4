50|$|The {{difficulty}} with negligence {{is that it}} still requires the plaintiff {{to prove that the}} defendant's conduct fell below the relevant standard of care. However, if an entire industry tacitly settles on a somewhat careless standard of conduct (that is, as analyzed {{from the perspective of a}} layperson), then the plaintiff may not be able to recover even though he or she is severely injured, because although the defendant's conduct caused his or her injuries, such conduct was not negligent in the legal sense (if everyone within the trade would inevitably testify that the defendant's conduct conformed to that of a reasonable <b>tradeperson</b> in such circumstances). As a practical matter, with the increasing complexity of products, injuries, and medical care (which made many formerly fatal injuries survivable), it is quite a difficult and expensive task to find and retain good expert witnesses who can establish the standard of care, breach, and causation.|$|E

50|$|Although African Americans {{generally}} {{lag behind}} Asian Americans in test scores, so do Whites {{to a lesser}} degree. However, compared with children in areas of China and India where some children, especially girls, end their education after the elementary level, education in the United States is compulsory to age 16 regardless of race or class. It is expected that over half of public education students {{will be required to}} pass standards-based assessments which expect that all students to be at least exposed to algebra by high school and exit prepared for college. In many other nations, such as Germany and Japan, those with lower test scores may be tracked as skilled <b>tradepersons</b> or unskilled laborers.|$|R
50|$|He became notorious in November 2003 when {{an episode}} of Eating Media Lunch {{featured}} a spoof of the current affairs programme Target, who often would use hidden cameras to catch less than reliable <b>tradepersons</b> or workers. In it, the spoof depicted two actors as Target camera technicians in someone else's home caught on hidden camera in various degrading acts such as masturbation, defecation (on a kitchen stove), injecting and smoking drugs and phone sex. Also, one technician stripped naked and covered himself with cling wrap, and later urinated on the other technician. The spoof attracted several complaints from viewers, however in March 2004 the BSA (Broadcasting Standards Authority) of New Zealand found the episode had not breached any guidelines.|$|R
40|$|The Blackwood Estuary in {{south-western}} Australia is {{a popular}} holiday destination designated {{to be included in}} the proposed ‘Capes’ Marine Park. During 2005, four seasonal sampling trips were undertaken to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of recreational boating and ﬁshing in the estuary. In addition, recreational anglers were interviewed to ascertain their catches, demographics, socioeconomics, frequency and locations of ﬁshing and attitudes to conservation and ﬁsheries management. There was marked seasonality in recreational use of the estuary, with high numbers of boats encountered over summer and autumn. Boats with anglers actively engaged in ﬁshing constituted 30 % of the 958 vessels recorded and some spatial patterns related to boat launching sites were apparent. Most anglers were visiting tourists from towns in south-western Australia and, although half of the angling parties were family groups, most respondents were 31 - 45 year-old males with relaxation their primary motive for ﬁshing. <b>Tradepersons,</b> professionals and retired farmers were common occupations amongst interviewed anglers. Cumulative expenditure on bait, tackle and capital equipment was considerable. Local residents and extended-stay caravanners who reside in Augusta over the summer months ﬁshed more frequently than short-stay visitors. Catches were dominated by yellow-ﬁnned whiting, Sillago schomburgkii, and Australian herring, Arripis georgiana. Support for biodiversity conservation measures and ﬁsheries management regulations was high, but non-compliance with size limits was common, apparently due to species misidentiﬁcation of juvenile ﬁsh by visiting anglers...|$|R
