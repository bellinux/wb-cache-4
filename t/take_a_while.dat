5|$|Five days of filming {{were spent}} at the London Underground tunnels. Filming took place on actual tube tunnels, albeit disused ones. As the crew were {{scouting}} the disused Aldwych tunnels, they found the ex-Northern line 1972 stock train stabled in the tunnel for maintenance, training, and filming purposes. When Sam Miller called Cross about the development, the writer included it as a last minute addition to the script, and the sequence was shot the next day. As a way to scare the audience, Cross included a homeless woman living in the train. The filming crew present disliked filming the Underground sequences because while filmed during the summer, it became hot locations to work in. The crew were prohibited from bringing food or drink into the tunnels, as it would attract rats. Furthermore, break times had to be longer than usual because it would <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> for a crew member to leave the tunnels, have a break and then return. The FSB base was filmed in the London Docklands, near the ExCeL London.|$|E

He stated that he would be delighted if Judy Craymer, Catherine Johnson, Phyllida Lloyd, Benny Andersson, and Björn Ulvaeus agreed to the project, noting that there are still plenty of ABBA songs to use.|$|E
25|$|Kicks in play can, if successful, {{result in}} rapid field advancement. Towards {{the end of}} the tackle count, the ball will often find its way to the best kicker on the team who will then return {{possession}} of the ball to the other side in the most favourable position for his team by kicking it down to the other end. These kicks are sometimes intended to go into touch (leave the field of play), resulting in a scrum to restart play. Scrums <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to form, so this gives the attacking team a chance for a short rest before play resumes.|$|E

25|$|Still in action, {{still moving}} with the wind away from the main fight, were Pallas and the Countess of Scarborough. Alliance was {{catching}} up fast, though, and as the near-undamaged, speedy, well-armed frigate approached, Captain Piercy understood that with seven of his own guns dismounted, four of his crew dead, twenty wounded, his rigging and sails too badly damaged to make a speedy getaway, he could neither win nor escape. With Landais hovering just beyond the range of his guns, he therefore struck his colours. Alliance approached him, seeking to take the Captain’s formal surrender, but after brief exchanges with both Piercy and Cottineau, Captain Landais accepted that his colleague should take the surrender and attend to casualties, while Alliance returned to the main battle. Because the return journey would be against the wind, this would, as Captain Piercy presumably intended, <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b>|$|E
500|$|Bumblebees use a {{combination}} of colour and spatial relationships to learn from which flowers to forage. They can also detect both the presence and the pattern of electric fields on flowers, which occur due to atmospheric electricity, and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to leak away into the ground. They use this information to find out if a flower has been recently visited by another bee. After arriving at a flower, they extract nectar using their long tongues ("glossae") and store it in their crops. Many species of bumblebees also exhibit [...] "nectar robbing": instead of inserting the mouthparts into the flower in the normal way, these bees bite directly through the base of the corolla to extract nectar, avoiding pollen transfer.|$|E

Of the series' use of green screen for sets, Blackwell stated [...] "{{sometimes}} it really works and sometimes the CGI sets could use improvement". He also felt that Amanda Tapping was convincing as a British scientist. In conclusion, Blackwell stated [...] "Sanctuary does <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to kick in, {{but it is a}} very good series once the writers actually write something with depth." [...] Alex Walker of Den of Geek rated the first season three stars out of five, stating [...] "the acting and scripting is good, but Sanctuary lacks the wit and charm of the genre's top shows like Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica. Also, the way some episodes alternate between fighting and exposition gives the impression of watching someone else play a videogame." [...] Walker also dubbed it a [...] "poor man's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, but said that it [...] "makes for [...] "agreeable early-evening viewing". Walker also believed that the DVD of the first season should really be for [...] "die-hard fans only".|$|E
500|$|During {{the process}} of {{founding}} a colony, {{as many as four}} queens cooperate with each other to find a suitable nesting ground, but after the first generation of workers is born, they fight each other until one queen is left alive. However, occasional colonies are known to have as many as six queens coexisting peacefully in the presence of workers. A queen searches for a suitable nest site to establish her colony, and excavates a small chamber in the soil or under logs and rocks, where she takes care of her young. A queen also hunts for prey instead of staying in her nest, a behaviour known as claustral colony founding. Although queens do provide sufficient amounts of food to feed their larvae, the first workers are [...] "nanitics" [...] (or minims), smaller than the smallest workers encountered in older developed colonies. Several species do not have any worker caste, and solitary queens will raid a colony, kill the residing queen, and take over the colony. The first generation of workers may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to fully develop into adults; for example, M. forficata eggs take around 100 days to fully develop, while other species may take up to eight months.|$|E
500|$|Merit is a [...] "beneficial and {{protective}} force which extends {{over a long}} period of time" [...] (B.J. Terwiel)—and is the effect of good deeds ( [...] , [...] ) done through physical action, words, or thought. As its Pāli language (the language of Theravada Buddhism, as practiced in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, etc.) definition indicates, this force is associated with goodness and purity of mind. In traditional Buddhist societies, it is believed that merit is more sustainable than that of magical rites, spirit worship or worldly power. The way merit works, is that acts of merit bring good and agreeable results, whereas demeritorious acts bring bad and disagreeable results. A mixture of the two generates mixed results in a person's life. This [...] (...) or [...] "automatic cosmic reaction" [...] (Brokaw) is a common idea found in Buddhist texts and Buddhist societies, and explains why people are different and lead different lives in many ways. Karma is self-regulatory and natural: it operates without divine intervention and human intention is fundamental to it. Internally, merit makes the mind happy and virtuous. Externally, present good circumstances, such as a long life, health and wealth, as well as the character and abilities someone is born with, arise from merits done in the past and vice versa, with demerits. The merits and demerits a person has done may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to bear fruit. Merit or demerit may cause a good or bad future respectively, including in the next lives to come. A bad destination after rebirth may be caused by demerit, but merely a lack of merit may also lead a person to be born in an unhappy destination. When someone is reborn in a happy destination, however, one can only stay there as long as merits last. Thus, it is stated in the Tipiṭaka that people cannot take anything with them when they die, except for whatever merit and demerit they have done, which will affect their future. Merit can be accumulated in different quantities, and stored up, but also has an impermanent character: it can run out. Summarizing from the Buddhist text Milinda Pañhā, some scholars conclude that merit is inherently stronger than demerit. Moreover, many merits together have the power to prevent demerits from having an effect, by pushing them [...] "to the back of the queue" [...] (Richard Gombrich), though demerits can never be undone.|$|E

2500|$|A {{major part}} of the work {{involved}} Manson rewriting the song lyrics, which Vig said the band attempted to [...] "write from a woman's perspective and I think, initially, some of them were a little pretentious.

[...] Manson detailed that regarding the previous song sketches, [...] "some of the ideas for lyrics I found unsuitable, and others I liked and worked on with them.

[...] She added that because [...] "the lyrics <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to work on" [...] bandmates would give suggestions and she included the ones that fancied her.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 September 2001, at Camp David, U.S. {{president}} George W.

[...] Shortly after, the White House said the president regretted use of the term crusade, as it might have been misunderstood as reference to the historical Crusades; the word crusade was not used again. On 20 September 2001, during a televised address to a joint session of Congress, George Bush said, [...] "Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there.

[...] Manson remarked that while the content was [...] "a lot more poppy" [...] than most of her previous work, the songs invoked the dark side of her nature, as [...] "sometimes I'm a bit wee creepy, and that definitely comes out in the music." [...] She also declared that music [...] "unlocks sensations and feelings that you keep inside, that society doesn't allow you to show", saying that the gist of a mean-spirited song like [...] "Vow" [...] is very real despite [...] "none of us hav ever really acted on those feelings". Vig added that the band was eager to exploit the contrast between words and music: [...] "The initial idea was to make this a dark lyric with a shiny, happy, pop sensibility.
