Explosive eruptions are characterized by gas-driven explosions that propels magma and tephra. Effusive eruptions, meanwhile, are characterized by <b>the</b> <b>outpouring</b> <b>of</b> lava without significant explosive eruption.|$|E
5|$|On 6 October, Pastor Maldonado and {{the manager}} and {{assistant}} manager he shared with Bianchi—namely, Nicolas Todt and Alessandro Alunni Bravi, respectively—also visited the hospital. Bianchi's parents arrived later that day and were joined, three days later, by their other children, Mélanie and Tom, as well as Jules' best friend, Lorenz Leclerc. The family released a statement the next day, expressing appreciation for <b>the</b> <b>outpouring</b> <b>of</b> support from the public and {{for the presence of}} professor Gerard Saillant, president of the FIA Medical Commission, and professor Alessandro Frati, neurosurgeon of the Sapienza University of Rome, who travelled to Japan at the request of Scuderia Ferrari. They also provided a medical update, confirming that the injury suffered was a diffuse axonal injury and that Bianchi was in a critical but stable condition.|$|E
5|$|In early 1623, Prince Charles, now 22, and Buckingham {{decided to}} seize the {{initiative}} and travel to Spain incognito, to win the infanta directly, but the mission proved an ineffectual mistake. The infanta detested Charles, and the Spanish confronted them with terms that included the repeal of anti-Catholic legislation by Parliament. Though a treaty was signed, the prince and duke returned to England in October without the infanta and immediately renounced the treaty, much {{to the delight of}} the British people. Disillusioned by the visit to Spain, Charles and Buckingham now turned James's Spanish policy upon its head and called for a French match and a war against the Habsburg empire. To raise the necessary finance, they prevailed upon James to call another Parliament, which met in February 1624. For once, <b>the</b> <b>outpouring</b> <b>of</b> anti-Catholic sentiment in the Commons was echoed in court, where control of policy was shifting from James to Charles and Buckingham, who pressured the king to declare war and engineered the impeachment of Lord Treasurer Lionel Cranfield, by now made Earl of Middlesex, when he opposed the plan on grounds of cost. The outcome of the Parliament of 1624 was ambiguous: James still refused to declare or fund a war, but Charles believed the Commons had committed themselves to finance a war against Spain, a stance that was to contribute to his problems with Parliament in his own reign.|$|E

25|$|Maitland's {{volcanic}} {{history is}} poorly known since only isolated {{remnants of the}} volcano remain. What is known, however, is that it formed during a pulse of NCVP magmatism {{that began with the}} eruption of Edziza about seven million years ago. The eruption rate of this period was much greater than what is observed for the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province today. Following the onset of activity at Edziza, Maitland volcanism commenced 5.2million years ago with <b>the</b> <b>outpouring</b> <b>of</b> alkali basalt and hawaiite lava on a broad, late Tertiary, low-relief surface. This resulted {{in the creation of a}} broad shield volcano. Subsequent volcanic activity created a complex edifice of trachyte and trachybasalt that formerly overlain the central part of the basaltic shield. Magmatism at Maitland continued until about 4.6million years ago when the volcano went extinct.|$|E

According to David Bindman, The Ruins [...] "achieved a popularity in England comparable to Rights of Man itself".

500|$|Such {{dramatic}} situations often polarize online communities. [...] Many members {{feel ashamed}} for believing elaborate lies, while others remain staunch supporters.

Feldman admits that an element of sadism may be evident {{in some of the}} more egregious abuses of trust. Pam Cohen, a grief counselor who witnessed <b>the</b> <b>outpouring</b> <b>of</b> emotion for Kaycee Nicole, likened the personal devastation resulting from genuine concern, sympathy, and support that forum members gave to the 19-year-old and her mother, only to discover none of it was true, to [...] "emotional rape".

500|$|The huge {{crowds that}} Harrison's {{campaign}} events attracted were unprecedented, though Jackson's campaigns {{for the presidency}} had seen rallies on a smaller scale. These gatherings both promoted the Whig ticket and were themselves entertainment for the participants, thus attracting even more attendees; as New York Governor William H.

[...] The Democrats were shocked by <b>the</b> <b>outpouring</b> <b>of</b> support, with Pennsylvania Senator James Buchanan noting that the people had [...] "abandoned their ordinary business for the purpose of electioneering". As the log cabin theme took hold, alternative nicknames for Harrison such as [...] "Old Buckeye" [...] were dropped, and Whigs, heretofore more associated with the wealthier classes, sought to appeal to the humbly-born. Senator Webster, in his speeches, regretted that he was not born in a log cabin (though his older siblings were), but he told of annual pilgrimages to the old cabin with his children to instill its values in them.|$|E

However, it appears that the [...] "Nirbhaya" [...] case has had an effect on the willingness of rape or molestation victims to report the crime; police records show that during the final nine months of 2013 almost twice as many rape victims filed a police report and four times as many allegations of molestation were made. A recent report released by the National Crime Records Bureau shows that 95 percent of the cases brought to the police were classified as a crime. However, there is a large backlog of cases with fewer than 15 percent of those charged tried in 2012, leaving 85 percent waiting to come to trial.|$|E

Poet Walt Whitman composed When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd to eulogize Lincoln, one of four poems he wrote about the assassinated president. Historians have emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but also noted that some Lincoln haters cheered when they heard the news. African-Americans were especially moved; they had lost 'their Moses'.
