40|$|AbstractA <b>tablet</b> <b>computer</b> is {{considered}} as {{a useful tool for}} elderly people to improve their everyday life and even to have training to enhance their cognitive ability. In this study, the authors conducted a preliminary experiment to see how different background colors of a <b>tablet</b> <b>computer</b> screen can affect the attention of elderly people while they are performing a task on the <b>tablet</b> <b>computer.</b> Ten Japanese subjects over sixty-five years old performed circle-counting tasks on a <b>tablet</b> <b>computer</b> screen with white, blue and light blue backgrounds. For these three background colors, three different symbols including circles were presented in black, and the subjects were directed to count the number of circles {{in a short period of}} time. The average percentages of correct answers for the circle-counting tasks that the subjects performed were higher with the blue and light blue backgrounds than with the white background. These results suggest that white color may not be the best choice for a background color of a <b>tablet</b> <b>computer</b> screen for elderly people...|$|R

All iPad models have a special A/V adapter that converts Apple's data line to a standard HDMI (Type A) port. Samsung has a similar proprietary thirty-pin port for their Galaxy Tab 10.1 that can adapt to HDMI as well as USB drives. The Dell Streak 5 smartphone/tablet hybrid is capable of outputting over HDMI. While the Streak uses a PDMI port, a separate cradle is available which adds HDMI compatibility. Most of the Chinese-made tablets running Android OS provide HDMI output using a mini-HDMI (type C) port. Most new laptops and desktops now have built in HDMI as well.|$|E
