Sudirman urged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> vice-president leave the city and fight as guerrillas, actions they had previously promised, but this suggestion was rejected. Although his doctors forbade it, Sudirman received permission from Sukarno to join his men. The central government evacuated to the Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat at the urging of Sultan HamengkubuwanaIX, but were captured and exiled.|$|E
5|$|Abraham Lincoln {{was assassinated}} by John Wilkes Booth on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while {{attending}} a play at Ford's Theatre as the American Civil War was {{drawing to a}} close. The assassination occurred {{five days after the}} surrender of Robert E. Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy) to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president. Learning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> Grant would be attending Ford's Theatre, Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at the theater, as well as Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their homes. Without his main bodyguard, Ward Hill Lamon, Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14. At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.|$|E
25|$|Cronkite then {{recapped}} {{the events}} {{as they had}} happened: <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> Governor Connally had been shot and were {{in the emergency room}} at Parkland Hospital, and no one knew their condition as yet. CBS then decided to return to ATWT, which was now midway through its second segment.|$|E

This report turned out to be false, and the story was retracted the following day.|$|E
25|$|The {{head of the}} Executive Branch is the President. Although {{also named}} in this first clause, the Vice President is not constitutionally vested with any {{executive}} power. Nonetheless, the Constitution dictates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> Vice President are to be elected at the same time, for the same term, and by the same constituency. The framers' intent was to preserve {{the independence of the}} executive branch should the person who was Vice President succeed to the duties of the presidency.|$|E
25|$|The cast had {{continued}} to perform live while Cronkite's bulletins broke into the broadcast, unaware of the unfolding events in Dallas. ATWT then took another scheduled commercial break. The segment before the break {{would be the last}} anyone would see of any network's programming until Tuesday, November 26. During the commercial, the bumper slide interrupted the proceedings again and Cronkite updated the viewers on the situation in Dallas. This bulletin went into more detail than the other two, revealing that Kennedy {{had been shot in the}} head, Connally in the chest. Cronkite remained on the air for the next ten minutes, continuing to read bulletins as they were handed to him, and recapping the events as they were known. He also related a report given to reporters by Texas Congressman Albert Thomas <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> Governor were still alive, the first indication of their condition. At 2:00 EST, with the top of the hour station break looming, Cronkite told the audience that there would be a brief pause so that all of CBS' affiliates, including those in the Mountain and Pacific time zones which were not on the same schedule, could join the network. He then left the radio booth and went to the anchor desk in the newsroom.|$|E

500|$|The 2004 {{legislative}} election brought further changes {{and a political}} swing to the right. Janez Janša, {{the leader of a}} right-wing coalition, formed the new government.

500|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, Homer and Kogen are in Moe's tavern, {{discussing}} their favourite football teams with Moe. When Moe mentions that his favourite team is the Atlanta Falcons, he holds a glass {{in front of his}} mouth, obscuring his lip movements. He then passes the same glass to Homer, who does the same. Originally, the characters would be saying something else, however, because the staff wanted the episode to be [...] "current", new dialogue was recorded for the scene. Because {{there was no time to}} animate the scene from scratch, the staff simply made the characters hold a glass in front of their mouths while saying their lines. This technique was also used in reference to the ongoing impeachment scandal, as when the characters mention <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> First Lady will be there, they cover their mouths when calling them by name. The song that plays during the bus trip to the Super Bowl was performed by NRBQ. The episode also features British rock band Blur's [...] "Song 2", which plays during the [...] "race" [...] to the stadium.|$|E
500|$|Clark {{received}} {{another call}} from General Shelton in July 1999 {{in which he}} was told that Secretary Cohen wanted Clark to leave his command in April 2000, less than three years after he assumed the post. Clark was surprised by this, because he believed SACEURs were expected to serve at least three years. Clark was told that this was necessary because General Joseph Ralston was leaving his post as the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and would need another 4-star command within 60 days or he would be forced to retire. Ralston {{was not going to be}} appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff due to an extramarital affair in his past, and the SACEUR position was said to be the last potential post for him. Clark said this explanation [...] "didn't wash"; he believed the legal issues did not necessarily bar him from a full term. Clinton signed on to Ralston's reassignment, although David Halberstam wrote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> Madeleine Albright were angered at Clark's treatment. Clark spent the remainder of his time as SACEUR overseeing peacekeeper forces and, without a new command to take, was forced into retirement from the military on May 2, 2000.|$|E

500|$|The University of Chicago was re-incorporated as a coeducational {{institution}} in 1890 by the American Baptist Education Society, using $400,000 {{donated to the}} ABES to match a $600,000 donation from Baptist oil magnate and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, and including land donated by Marshall Field. While the Rockefeller donation provided money for academic operations and long-term endowment, it was stipulated that such money {{could not be used}} for buildings. The Hyde Park campus was financed by donations from wealthy Chicagoans like Silas B. Cobb who provided the funds for the campus' first building, Cobb Lecture Hall, and matched Marshall Field's pledge of $100,000. Other early benefactors included businessmen Charles L. Hutchinson (trustee, treasurer and donor of Hutchinson Commons), Martin A. Ryerson (president {{of the board of trustees}} and donor of the Ryerson Physical Laboratory) Adolphus Clay Bartlett and Leon Mandel, who funded the construction of the gymnasium and assembly hall, and George C. Walker of the Walker Museum, a relative of Cobb who encouraged his inaugural donation for facilities. The university's Articles of Incorporation provided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> two-thirds of the Trustees must be members of [...] "regular Baptist churches", on penalty of losing that part of the land purchased by the ABES, though this requirement was reduced in 1922 to requiring that 3/5 of the trustees must be members of Baptist churches.|$|E

2500|$|In Federalist No. 70, Hamilton {{counters}} {{claims of}} his desire to recreate the monarchy by outlining the structural {{ways in which the}} president’s power is more limited than the power of a king.
