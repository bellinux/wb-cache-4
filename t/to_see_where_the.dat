5|$|The strong odor {{associated}} with marsh shrews (in common with other long-tailed shrews) {{may be a}} means of communication. Similar to other shrews, they have poor eyesight. If a marsh shrew is placed in a foreign environment (such as along an edge of a raised surface), it will run off the edge and continue to run after landing on the surface below. Landing in water, it dives beneath the surface. Marsh shrews are easily trapped in sunken cans, possibly due to their inability <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> edges of surfaces drop. In captivity they vocalize when they are displaced or scuffle with other animals in their cage, twittering shrilly if disturbed while eating or in a confrontation over food (such as a worm). Although it is uncertain whether marsh shrews cache (or hoard) food in the wild, in captivity they set aside nightcrawlers {{in a corner of}} the cage for later consumption; no other food items were set aside in this fashion.|$|E
5|$|Whirling {{disease was}} first {{detected}} in fish in Johnson Lake in Banff National Park in May, 2016. CFIA Labs confirmed in August and Parks Canada announced the outbreak August 23, 2016. Although {{it was first}} discovered in Banff, {{it is not necessarily}} where the disease originated and spread. The Government of Alberta is currently sampling and testing fish in 6 different watersheds (Peace River, Athabasca, North Saskatchewan, Red Deer, Bow and Oldman) <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> disease has spread. Initial sample fish were collected in 2016, and are currently being processed by the Government of Alberta and CFIA labs. Since testing began, it has been detected in the Upper Bow River, and in May 2017 it was confirmed that whirling disease had also been detected in the Oldman River Basin. The declaration does not mean that every susceptible finfish population within the Bow and Oldman River watersheds are infected with the disease.|$|E

25|$|Generally, {{high-level}} programming languages, such as Java, make debugging easier, {{because they}} have features such as exception handling and type checking that make real sources of erratic behaviour easier to spot.

25|$|In the European Community (EC), eye {{protection}} requirements are specified in European standard EN 207.

25|$|Speed is {{the change}} in {{distance}} to an object with respect to time. Thus the existing system for measuring distance, combined with a memory capacity <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> target last was, is enough to measure speed. At one time the memory consisted of a user making grease pencil marks {{on the radar screen}} and then calculating the speed using a slide rule. Modern radar systems perform the equivalent operation faster and more accurately using computers.|$|E

25|$|Since the Zapatista {{uprising}} in 1994, {{the city has}} developed a type of cult tourism focusing around the EZLN. This tourism attracts those interested in both leftist political beliefs and indigenous activism who come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> events of the 1990s happened {{as well as what}} is going on now. This tourism has spurred the creation of Zapatista-themed shops which sell EZLN shirts and other souvenirs. This tourism has been given the name of “Zapaturismo” or “Zapatourism”. The term originally was derogatory and referred to the large number of leftist activists which converged on the city after the EZLN uprising began. Since then, the term receives mixed reviews with some finding humor in it.|$|E
25|$|Back in London, Sargent {{was quickly}} busy again. His working methods were by then well-established, {{following}} {{many of the}} steps employed by other master portrait painters before him. After securing a commission through negotiations which he carried out, Sargent would visit the client's home <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> painting was to hang. He would often review a client's wardrobe to pick suitable attire. Some portraits were done in the client's home, but more often in his studio, which was well-stocked with furniture and background materials he chose for proper effect. He usually required eight to ten sittings from his clients, although {{he would try to}} capture the face in one sitting. He usually kept up pleasant conversation and sometimes he would take a break and play the piano for his sitter. Sargent seldom used pencil or oil sketches, and instead laid down oil paint directly. Finally, he would select an appropriate frame.|$|E
25|$|On {{the right}} of the 24th Division, the 73rd Brigade {{attacked}} either side of the Trônes Wood–Guillemont track; the battalion to the south, kept close to the barrage but was stopped by machine-gun fire, at the German front line. Attempts to get into the trench failed and a German counter-bombardment made the passage of reinforcements impossible. The battalion attacking north of the track was also held up on the right but on the left managed to get into the German front line, near the quarry despite German counter-attacks, as British reinforcements arrived to help consolidate. To the north, touch was gained with the right-hand battalion of the 17th Brigade, which had been unable <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> barrage began to creep but had advanced anyway and taken many German prisoners. The brigade reached the German front line and part of Waterlot Farm road, at the second objective which were quickly consolidated. Communication by telephone and visual signals did not collapse, which kept the supporting artillery in contact with the infantry.|$|E

25|$|The tramway {{began and}} ended with the oyster fishery from 1864 to 1884. So that cargo could begin its journey to Kent and London on a horse-tram, the tramway was built due south from the pier to the railway which had been built in 1861. This track, which was later to become Hampton Pier Avenue, was {{straightened}} at its northern end and raised above risk of flood for the tram. By 1866 the tracks were still not laid along the pier itself, {{but according to the}} OS map of 1878, it had been completed by then. At the southern end, the tramway curved westward, running beside Westbrook, and reached the railway line just east of the point where Westbrook crosses it, and to the west of where Hampton Close is today: see 1878 map, pictured. One Judah Downs won £900 in a dispute over land crossed by the tramway, and the company later bought him out as well. After the company went into liquidation, the tramway was removed in the 1880s. For much of the 20th century it was possible <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> tramway reached the railway line.|$|E
500|$|In October 2011, Kevin Feige, {{president}} of Marvel Studios said the studio {{was beginning to}} look at their Phase Two films, which would start with Iron Man 3 and would culminate in a second Avengers film.

By being the next thing that should happen to these characters, and not just a rehash of what seemed to work the first time. By having a theme that is completely fresh and organic to itself." [...] Despite the production of the film becoming increasingly wider in scope, Feige maintained that this was not their intention, always looking <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> team wanted to take the characters, over how to make it bigger than The Avengers.|$|E
500|$|Rhys has a {{one-night stand}} with Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) not long after his introduction. Rhys meets Kate in the local bar {{and they have a}} [...] "big night out"; the {{following}} morning Kate wakes up in Rhys' apartment. Brewer told a writer for Inside Soap [...] "You don't actually see the lead-up– one minute she meets Rhys in a bar, the next minute we see that they've already slept together!" [...] Kate feels awkward about the situation, but it is made worse when she is unable to remember Rhys' name. When Kate and Rhys meet again, they have different attitudes to their one-night stand. Brewer said Rhys is [...] "a bit of a player", so it is not a big deal to him. He does not have any expectations of Kate, but she is uncomfortable with it and tries to cover her tracks. In November 2011, Brewer said {{it would be interesting to}} revisit the relationship between Rhys and Kate. Barber also thought it would be interesting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> characters could go together. The actor added that [...] "sparks fly" [...] when Rhys is around Kate, as he knows how to [...] "press her buttons".|$|E

500|$|The Simpsons {{decide to}} investigate. They {{go to the}} old quarry where they meet Chief Wiggum, who comes with them. Marge uses Burly paper towels to drain {{the water from the}} quarry. Then, they find the {{skeleton}} and go into the inlet pipe <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> body came from. They find that the pipe leads to a ladder which, in turn, leads to Mr. Burns's office. They confront him about the body, but he insists he did not murder anyone. He tells them that the dead man is Smithers' father, Waylon Smithers Sr. He shows an old surveillance tape, filmed during the imminent meltdown in which Smithers' father goes into an unstable reactor core to prevent the meltdown. He succeeds in saving the city, but he dies in the process due to exposure to large amounts of radiation. Burns tells them that he kept the truth from Waylon Jr.; Smithers then enters the room, having heard the entire story. Burns apologizes to him, saying he wanted to spare him from telling the story about his father's real death. However, Smithers admits that he is glad that his father died as a real hero rather than from a tribe of savage Amazon women, which Burns told him earlier. Declaring the case of the haunted quarry solved, Homer stores the skull in his [...] "Memories" [...] box, despite Marge's insistence to give it to Smithers.|$|E

[...] Eric Goldman of IGN scored the episode 7.9 out of 10, praising the [...] "darker and edgier elements" [...] of the episode, the Akela/May fight, and Ward's storyline, pointing out that [...] "some viewers have found [...] to be dull.

500|$|The BX {{arrived in}} South Fort George on June 24, to {{a warm welcome}} from the local populace. The steamer landing on the Fraser had been there since 1909 and was already used by the Charlotte, Chilco and Quesnel. Nevertheless, local {{residents}} had been anticipating {{the day of the}} BX's arrival <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> company would choose to have its landing and where it would build its office and warehouse. Many local business decisions were going to be based on this, as it was widely and correctly assumed that the BX would be bringing up the bulk of the passengers and landseekers from the south. One businessman, hotelier Al Johnson, was waiting for this information so he would know where to build Fort George's first licensed hotel, the Hotel Northern. [...] The promoters of South Fort George were well aware of the huge benefit it would be to have the landing at their town-site, so the day after the BX arrived they offered the BC Express Company free lots of their choice in South Fort George. The company accepted the offer and construction on the facilities was begun. This would be a huge disappointment to South Fort George's rival town-site, Central Fort George on the Nechako River, which had hoped for the BC Express's landing and offices for itself. George Hammond, the promoter for Central, made the best he could out of a bad situation and hired a representative for the Central town-site and had him travel on the BX and promote Central to the passengers before they arrived in South Fort George.|$|E
