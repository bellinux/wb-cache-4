5|$|The {{following}} season a {{new ground}} {{was built for}} Hull City {{across the road from}} the cricket ground. Still under the managership of Ambrose Langley, Hull continued to finish consistently in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table. They came close to promotion in the 1909–10 season, recording what would be their highest finish until they matched it in 2008. Hull finished third, level on points with second placed Oldham Athletic, missing promotion on goal average by 0.29 of a goal. Hull regularly finished in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table before the First World War, but after the war the team finished in the bottom half in seven seasons out of eleven, culminating in relegation to the Third Division North in 1930.|$|E
5|$|After {{growing up}} in Toxteth, Liverpool, Nolan signed for Bolton Wanderers {{at the age of}} 16. Part of the team that beat Preston North End in the 2001 First Division play-offs to gain {{promotion}} to the Premier League, he soon became a regular first-team player for the club. He scored as Bolton beat Manchester United at Old Trafford in both of his first two seasons in the top tier of English football, as well as important goals that helped Bolton regularly finish in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Premier League table.|$|E

A victory against St Johnstone in their penultimate league match lifted Hearts into fifth place, a qualifying position. Hearts then rested some players for their final league match, a 5–0 defeat by Celtic. Entering the week before the cup final, Hearts had concerns about the fitness of striker Craig Beattie, who was unable to train due to a hamstring injury.|$|E
5|$|In the 2007–08 season, West Ham {{remained}} reasonably consistently in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> league table, with Fredrik Ljungberg in the team, {{despite a}} slew of injuries; new signing Craig Bellamy missed most of the campaign, while Kieron Dyer was out from August 2007. The last game of the season, at the Boleyn Ground, saw West Ham draw 2–2 against Aston Villa, ensuring a tenth-place finish three points ahead of rivals Tottenham Hotspur. It was a five-place improvement on the previous season, and most importantly West Ham were never under any realistic threat of relegation.|$|E
5|$|Napoli {{entered the}} Serie A era under the {{management}} of William Garbutt. During Garbutt's six-year stint, the club would be dramatically transformed, frequently finishing in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table. This included two third-place finishes during the 1932–33 and 1933–34 seasons, with added notables such as Antonio Vojak, Arnaldo Sentimenti and Carlo Buscaglia. However, in the {{years leading up to}} World War II, Napoli went into decline, only surviving relegation in 1939–40 by goal average.|$|E

5|$|Portishead Town F.C. {{played in}} small {{regional}} leagues for years until joining the Somerset County League in 1975. They won the Premier Division title {{four times in}} five years between 1993–94 and 1997–98. After their fourth successive runner-up campaign in the 2004–05 season, Portishead successfully applied for promotion to the Western League. In Portishead's first season of Western League football they finished in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table only {{to better their performance}} the following season. In 2006–07 Portishead achieved their highest ever finish {{in the history of the}} club, finishing runners-up to Truro City.|$|E
5|$|Australia first {{competed in}} figure skating in 1952, and has competed in 1956, 1960 and every Olympics since 1980. In earlier years, Australia earned some last places or near-misses. Until 1988, no Australian had placed above the 20th percentile, but results have slowly improved; Anthony Liu {{finished}} 10th out of 28 {{competitors in the}} men's event in 2002. Joanne Carter represented Australia in 1998 & 2006. She had placed 12th in 2002 and apart from Liu is the only Australian to have placed in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field. In 2010, Australia's lone participant Cheltzie Lee came 20th. Australia has competed in ice dancing only twice—in 1988 and 2014—when their solitary representative in both the men and women's individual event came last.|$|E

With half an inning left to play, the Dodgers began to get hits off of Dickson. Galan doubled, and after Walker flied out, Ed Stevens tripled to score Galan and Furillo singled to score Stevens, after a wild pitch and a walk, Brecheen took over pitching duties for Dickson with St. Louis leading 8–3. Edwards singled off Brecheen and allowed Furillo to score, and after Cookie Lavagetto walked, the score was 8–4 with the bases loaded. The Cardinals kept the score from getting any closer, as Brecheen struck out the final two batters to end the game.|$|E
5|$|On {{the chart}} dated December 2, 2006, {{nearly two months}} after initial release, Acoustic Hearts of Winter debuted at number 78 on the Billboard 200, where it peaked. It {{remained}} inside <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chart for three weeks, and maintained a position inside the top 200 albums for seven weeks. On the Billboard Top Holiday Albums chart, on the chart issued November 25, 2006, the album debuted at number 20. A week later, it moved up to number 14, where it peaked, and spent 14 weeks on the chart. Acoustic Hearts of Winter was the second best-selling Holiday album of the 2006 holiday season. During the 2007 and 2008 holiday seasons, the album re-entered the Holiday Albums chart at 45 and 28, respectively. The album had sold 110,000 copies in the United States to date.|$|E
5|$|Stengel was {{introduced}} as Yankee manager on October 12, 1948, the 25th {{anniversary of his}} second World Series home run to beat the Yankees. Joe DiMaggio attended the press conference {{as a sign of}} team support. Stengel faced obstacles to being accepted—Harris had been popular with the press and public, and the businesslike Yankee corporate culture and successful tradition were thought to be ill matched with a manager who had the reputation of a clown and who had never had a major league team finish in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standings. Stengel's MLB involvement had been in the National League, and there were several American League parks in which he had neither managed nor played.|$|E

5|$|The 1950s brought {{little league}} success, but were notable for goal-scoring by Jack Connor, whose 140 goals in five seasons {{are still a}} club record. These {{included}} 13 hat-tricks (three of which were consecutive – once against Crewe Alexandra and twice against Chester), two instances of four goals in a match (against Workington and Carlisle United), and two of five goals in a match (against Bradford Park Avenue and the Tranmere Rovers). When the regional Third Divisions were to be combined into national Third and Fourth Divisions after the 1957–58 campaign, Stockport finished in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Division North and so {{were placed in the}} following season's national Third Division.|$|E
5|$|The Olympics {{were then}} halted {{due to the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II. Australia did not send a team to the 1948 Winter Olympics, but has competed at every Winter Olympics since, sending nine athletes to the 1952 Olympics. There were five skiers, two cross-country and three downhill—who either failed to finish or whose results were unknown—three figure skaters and one speed skater. Adrian Swan and Nancy Burley, who finished 10th and 14th in figure skating, {{were the only two}} Australia competitors to place in the top 20, although neither placed in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field.
