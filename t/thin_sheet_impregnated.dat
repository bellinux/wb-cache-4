A bonding adhesive is interposed between the <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> and the subadjacent member, and the <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> is subjected to a high fluid pressure.

40|$|A {{randomized}} controlled trial {{was conducted to}} test {{the effect of a}} <b>sheet</b> <b>impregnated</b> with benzyl benzoate in preventing mite infestation of new bedding. <b>Impregnated</b> <b>sheets</b> were placed on the mattresses of 17 subjects, while 19 subjects received placebo sheets. Over the following 2 years infestation occurred more commonly, and tended to be heavier, in the beds with inactive sheets than in those with impregnated sheets; among the 27 beds with three items of new bedding sampled on four occasions, a mite count of five or more occurred significantly more often where the sheet was inactive than where it was active (11 of 13 and 5 of 14 respectively). The application of a <b>sheet</b> <b>impregnated</b> with benzyl benzoate appears to prevent mite infestation and may be useful for patients with mite allergy who obtain new bedding as part of a mite-avoidance regimen...|$|R

There are two splashing regimes that occur when the liquid viscosity is varied, as is evidenced by its dependence on ambient gas pressure. A high-viscosity drop splashes by emitting a <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> of liquid from a spreading liquid lamella long after the drop has first contacted the solid. Likewise, we find that there is also a delay in the ejection of a <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> when a low-viscosity drop splashes.

MethodsGHM <b>sheet</b> <b>impregnated</b> with antagomir- 92 a, its scramble sequence antagomir-control sheet or the sheet alone was attached {{on the area}} at risk of MI after the left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) {{was included in the}} sheet to trace proliferating cells. ResultsThe antagomir- 92 a sheet significantly increased capillary density in the infarct border zone 14 days after MI compared to the antagomir-control sheet or the sheet alone, associated with an increase in endothelial cells incorporated with BrdU. The antagomir- 92 a sheet significantly increased cardiac stem cells incorporated with BrdU 3 days after MI in the infarct border zone. This was associated with an increase in cardiomyocytes incorporated with BrdU 14 days after MI. Scar area was significantly reduced by the antagomir- 92 a sheet compared to the antagomir-control sheet or the sheet alone (12. 8  ±  1. 3 vs 25. 2  ±  2. 2, 24. 0  ±  1. 7 % LV area, respectively) 14 days after MI. LV dilatation was inhibited, and LV wall motion was improved 14 days after MI in rats with the antagomir- 92 a sheet compared to the antagomir-control sheet or the sheet alone. ConclusionsThese results suggest that attachment of the GHM <b>sheet</b> <b>impregnated</b> with antagomir- 92 a on the area at risk of MI enhances angiogenesis, promotes cardiomyogenesis, and ameliorates LV function...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a novel {{manufacturing}} process is proposed {{as an alternative}} method for fabrication of double metallic bipolar plates from initially flat <b>thin</b> <b>sheets.</b> The proposed process combined hydroforming of <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> metal blanks to create micro-channel arrays with in-die mechanical bonding to create double bipolar plates in a single-step and single-die operation to result in thin, lightweight, and flexible bipolar plates where flow fields are formed {{on both sides and}} internal cooling channels are formed in the middle, eliminating further welding, assembly and sealing operations otherwise required with the existing methods. For a successful development of the proposed process, different scientific and research issues are investigated and discussed in this study. First, to characterize the material behavior of <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> metals at micro-scale, hydraulic bulge tests are performed to investigate the so-called “size effects” (i. e., grain, specimen, and feature size) on the material behavior. Based on the bulge test results, new material models are developed to include the size effect parameters. Second, to understand the deformation mechanics of <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> metals in micro-feature fabrication under complex loading conditions, hydroforming of different micro-channel sizes using <b>thin</b> <b>sheets</b> is performed. Effects of channel design and process condition on the overall channel formability are discussed. With the use of FEA and appropriate material models, a parametric study is conducted to establish design guidelines for process and tooling design. Third, a mechanical bonding process, specifically, pressure welding of <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> metals, is investigated to gain a full understanding of the process limitation and characterization. The understanding from the welding tests suggests different process windows for successful bonding of <b>thin</b> <b>sheets.</b> Finally, predictive process models of the hybrid process are developed using a finite element (FE) tool for rapid evaluation the process producibility. Based on the simulation results, a set of experimental tooling is developed and tested to demonstrate the feasibility of the hybrid process for fabrication of fuel cell bipolar plates in a single-step and single-die operation...|$|R

40|$|Curved <b>thin</b> <b>sheets</b> are ubiquitously {{found in}} nature and manmade structures. Within the {{framework}} of classical thin plate theory, the stiffness of <b>thin</b> <b>sheets</b> is independent of its bending state. This assumption, however, goes against intuition. Simple experiments with a cantilever sheet made of paper show that the cantilever stiffness largely increases with the transversal curvature. We here demonstrate by using simple geometric arguments that <b>thin</b> <b>sheets</b> subject to two-dimensional bending necessarily develop internal stresses. The coupling between the internal stresses and the bending moments can increase the stiffness of the plate by several times. We develop a theory that describes the stiffness of curved <b>thin</b> <b>sheets</b> with simple equations {{in terms of the}} longitudinal and transversal curvatures. The theory perfectly fits experimental results with a macroscopic cantilever sheet as well as numerical simulations by the finite element method. The results shed new light on plant and insect wing biomechanics and provide an easy route to engineer micro- and nanomechanical structures based on ultrathin materials with extraordinary stiffness tunability...|$|R
