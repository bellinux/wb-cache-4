5|$|Even {{though their}} most recent single was doing poorly, Deep Purple {{maintained}} {{a reputation as a}} fine live act in the US. The band had now begun to develop their stage presence into something grander, going in a louder and heavier direction and focusing more and more on the instrumental interplay between Blackmore and Lord. In particular the latter had found a way to short-circuit the original Leslie speakers of his Hammond organ C-3 and connect the instrument directly into <b>the</b> <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> Marshall amps, obtaining a roaring sound and matching the guitar in loudness.|$|E

25|$|Using {{the same}} total on the dice (or {{the total of}} the two throws), the player whose wall is chosen then counts <b>the</b> <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> tiles from right to left. (For double throws, the count may extend {{to the left side}} player's stack.) This determines the {{location}} where the 'deck' of tiles is cut. Starting from the left of the stacks counted, the dealer draws four tiles for himself, and players in anti-clockwise order draw blocks of four tiles until all players have 12 tiles, so that the stacks decrease clockwise. Each player then draws one last tile to make a 13-tile hand.|$|E

In the night before the battle, a large number of civilians fled the village. The Reds had built their main defensive line to the Hirsikangas Hill, two kilometres north of Länkipohja. They had brought down a large number of trees, then piled the cut logs on the both sides of the road and soaked them with water. In the below zero temperature, <b>the</b> <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> wood were now covered by thick ice. The structure extended more than 50 meters {{on both sides of the}} road.

40|$|We have {{identified}} a 55 kDa protein, named GRASP 55 (Golgi reassembly <b>stacking</b> protein <b>of</b> 55 kDa), as a component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Golgi <b>stacking</b> machinery. GRASP 55 is homologous to GRASP 65, an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive membrane protein required for <b>the</b> <b>stacking</b> <b>of</b> Golgi cisternae in a cell-free system. GRASP 65 exists in a complex with the vesicle docking protein receptor GM 130 to which it binds directly, and the membrane tethering protein p 115, which also functions in <b>the</b> <b>stacking</b> <b>of</b> Golgi cisternae. GRASP 55 binding to GM 130, could not be detected using biochemical methods, although a weak interaction was detected with the yeast two-hybrid system.

500|$|According to the tale, a {{man called}} Thorolf Stuck-up had a bull which wounded his neighbours' farm animals, damaged haystacks and caused [...] "a great deal of trouble". [...] When an {{upstanding}} local farmer named Thord saw the bull damaging <b>the</b> <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> peat on his farm at Marbaeli, he lunged at the animal with a spear and struck it dead. [...] In revenge, Thorolf killed Thord's seven- or eight-year-old son Olaf, to the disgust of Thorolf's wife and kinsmen. [...] Thorolf fled and eventually secured the protection of Thorvald Hjaltasson, a prominent leader who lived at Hjaltadal. [...] After Christmas, Thorvald secured for him the safekeeping and support of Starri of Guddalir, who often sheltered outlaws.|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, Doniger O'Flaherty was {{critical}} of Dreamtime, commenting that [...] "Duerr is attempting to hunt with the hounds and run with the hare, and his book is likely to infuriate both ordinary readers and scholars." [...] Although initially appearing suitable for the average reader, she felt that most would be {{put off by the}} [...] "daunting scholarly apparatus" [...] he had employed, and the [...] "heaviness of the argument". Believing that the book was difficult to read, she felt that Duerr had hidden his arguments in the footnotes, and that reading the first third of the book was akin to [...] "wandering stoned through <b>the</b> <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> a very fine European library, browsing in the sections devoted to witchcraft, hallucinogens and orgiastic cults. It is good fun, but it is not for all tastes." [...] She equally felt that the book would be criticized by academics and other scholars working in the fields of witchcraft history and the history of religion, who would recognize that the book not only contained multiple factual errors, but also that many of Duerr's arguments were unoriginal, having previously been made by Mircea Eliade and Victor Turner.|$|E

2500|$|In most eukaryotes, the Golgi {{apparatus}} {{is made up}} of {{a series}} of compartments consisting of two main networks: the cis Golgi network (CGN) and the trans Golgi network (TGN). The CGN is a collection of fused, flattened membrane-enclosed disks known as cisternae (singular: cisterna, also called [...] "dictyosomes"), originating from vesicular clusters that bud off the endoplasmic reticulum. A mammalian cell typically contains 40 to 100 stacks. Between four and eight cisternae are usually present in a stack; however, in some protists as many as sixty cisternae have been observed. This collection of cisternae is broken down into cis, medial, and trans compartments. The TGN is the final cisternal structure, from which proteins are packaged into vesicles destined to lysosomes, secretory vesicles, or the cell surface. The TGN is usually positioned adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> the Golgi apparatus, but can also be separate from the stacks. The TGN may act as an early endosome in yeast and plants.|$|E
