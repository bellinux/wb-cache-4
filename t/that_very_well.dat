25|$|The {{border patrol}} mission started with DH-4s and Curtiss JN-4 Jennies, with both {{eventually}} replaced with updated Dayton-Wright DH-4Bs. Most {{of the first}} planes were not properly equipped for field service. Not knowing what turn events on the border might take, the Army wanted the planes ready for any eventuality. Colonel James E. Fechet, Air Service Officer at the Southern Department, found it no easy task to obtain bomb racks, machine gun mounts, cameras, and other equipment. There was a delay, for example, in installing synchronized Martin guns because parts supplied with the guns did not fit the planes on the border. The radios on some planes could send only in code and could not do <b>that</b> <b>very</b> <b>well.</b> Compasses were unreliable, maps sketchy and of little use. The country over which the men had to fly was wild and rough and sparsely populated, with few places for safe emergency landings.|$|E

After working in London for six months, Mitchell returned to Australia. During October and November she undertook a national tour starting in Canberra and finishing in Perth.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Sundberg, a {{veterinarian}} {{and vice president}} of the U.S. National Pork Board, a leading proponent of gestation crates, told The Washington Post: [...] "Farmers treat their animals well because that's just good business.

It's important for us to move on, to move forward from that; that is me as a player, me as a captain {{and the rest of the}} team as well...
