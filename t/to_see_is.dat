25|$|In the {{following}} weeks several eminent former Scottish judges {{became involved in}} the debate. On 28 September 2007, former Solicitor General and retired Senator of the College of Justice, Lord McCluskey, gave an interview to The Herald stating that he believed Lord Hamilton had no grounds to accuse Elish Angiolini of threatening the independence of the judiciary. He is quoted as saying, 'He's quite wrong. What he fails <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> that it is sometimes essential for a minister to comment upon a case. It happens all the time in parliament'.|$|E
500|$|The film is {{loosely based}} on the actual crimes {{attributed}} to an unidentified serial killer known as the Phantom Killer; it claims that [...] "the incredible story you are about <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> true, where it happened and how it happened; only the names have been changed." [...] The actual Phantom attacked eight people between February 22 and May 3, 1946 {{in or near the}} town of Texarkana, Texas, which is on the Texas border with Arkansas. Most of the murders occurred in rural areas just outside Texarkana, in Bowie County, Texas, while the film has them occurring in Arkansas. However, the general outline of the murders largely follows reality, with mostly minor artistic license taken. As in the film, the real killer was never identified nor apprehended.|$|E
500|$|... "Lighters" [...] {{is mainly}} an {{alternative}} hip hop track. [...] It {{has also been}} described as a blend of rap/hip-hop and pop, further incorporating parts of a synth ballad. The record differs from the hardcore hip hop style used in other songs by Bad Meets Evil in the EP, as it takes influences from synthpop ballad and soul music, mainly on the track's chorus. The song opens with piano chords while Mars sings with his [...] "warm" [...] and [...] "pleasing" [...] vocals in a tenor tone on top of a pop and soul chorus, [...] "This one's for you and me living out our dreams". The singer finishes his verse saying, [...] "All I want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> a sky full of lighters". Afterwards, the bass drops along with synth chords and Eminem starts to rap with his [...] "crescendos build up to fist-pumping levels", [...] being followed by Royce.|$|E

500|$|Marxists, who {{are skeptical}} of right-wing populist {{conspiracy}} theories, also accuse the global power elite {{of not having}} {{the best interests of}} all at heart, and many intergovernmental organizations of suffering from a democratic deficit, but they argue that the superclass are plutocrats only interested in brazenly imposing a neoliberal or neoconservative new world order—the implementation of global capitalism through economic and military coercion to protect the interests of transnational corporations—which systematically undermines the possibility of a socialist one-world government. Arguing that the world {{is in the middle of}} a transition from the American Empire to the rule of a global ruling class that has emerged from within the American Empire, they point out that right-wing populist conspiracy theorists, blinded by their anti-communism, fail <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> that what they demonize as the [...] "New World Order" [...] is, ironically, the highest stage of the very capitalist economic system they defend.|$|E
500|$|SpongeBob and Patrick find a {{piece of}} a {{medallion}} to the lost city of Atlantis, but {{have no idea what it}} is. They take it to the Bikini Bottom Museum to see if the staff there know what it is. SpongeBob and Patrick run into Squidward, who thinks they stole the missing half of the medallion. He soon matches it to the displayed other half of the medallion and tells them it was the key to Atlantis. After hearing the story of Atlantis, the only thing SpongeBob and Patrick want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> the [...] "World's Oldest Bubble." [...] Squidward then proceeds to reconnect the two halves of the medallion, opening the [...] "path to Atlantis", which is a bus that runs on [...] "song fuel". When the characters run out of [...] "song fuel", the bus then crash-lands into the city of Atlantis. The group is unknowingly followed by Plankton.|$|E
500|$|Hooper has cited {{changes in}} the {{cultural}} and political landscape as central influences on the film. His intentional misinformation, that the [...] "film you are about <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> true", {{was a response to}} being [...] "lied to by the government about things that were going on all over the world", including Watergate, the 1973 oil crisis, and [...] "the massacres and atrocities in the Vietnam War". The [...] "lack of sentimentality and the brutality of things" [...] that Hooper noticed while watching the local news, whose graphic coverage was epitomized by [...] "showing brains spilled all over the road", led to his belief that [...] "man was the real monster here, just wearing a different face, so I put a literal mask on the monster in my film". The idea of using a chainsaw as the murder weapon came to Hooper {{while he was in the}} hardware section of a busy store, contemplating how to speed his way through the crowd.|$|E

500|$|In 2003, Hagström {{hinted at}} the {{direction}} of the band's next album by saying, [...] "There's only one thing I really feel that is important. We've never measured our success in terms of sales, because we're quite an extreme band. It's more that people understand where we're coming from. I get more out of a fan coming up and saying that we've totally changed their way of looking on metal music, than having like 200 kids buy it. I mean, it would be nice for the money, but that's not why we're in it. So what I'd like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> that we keep progressing. Keeping the core of what Meshuggah has always been, but exploring the bar, so to speak. Destroy Erase Improve was like exploring the dynamics of the band, Chaosphere was exploring the aggressiveness, the all-out side, and Nothing is more of a sinister, dark, pretty slow album, actually. So honestly, now I don't know where we're going. It might be a mix of all of them." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Malley was {{characterized}} a [...] "hapless naif". On {{the topic of}} O'Malley's longtime crush on Meredith in the second season, Knight said: [...] "What's {{going to be very}} interesting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> what he's going to do with Meredith. It's getting close to time. Whatever he chooses to do will inform who he is the rest of his life." [...] After their sexual encounter occurred onscreen, Knight {{said in an interview with}} Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune: [...] "George wasn't really paying full attention. He was letting his own feelings override his respect for Meredith. A person really clued in would get that there wasn't anything coming back, but he was so in his head about it and caught up in his own feelings that he wasn't listening. It's not just that he loves her...it's a kind of selfish love he had for her." [...] He also added that, [...] "I think George has a lot of growing up to do. Part of that is making horrible, stupid mistakes. He's been pretty sheltered." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Leslie (Amy Poehler) and Tom (Aziz Ansari) {{responding}} to an incident at a park trail, where teenage boys {{are picking up}} plastic baggies of dog droppings and throwing them at each other. [...] Leslie tries to stop them but ends up playing along with the boys and admitting that it is fun. [...] Later, at the Pawnee town hall, a construction company has sent a gift basket with wine and cheese to the parks department, but Leslie locks it away {{because they are not}} allowed to accept gifts over $25. [...] Later, she and the others in the department look at a new social-networking site that April (Aubrey Plaza) has set up for the pit construction project. [...] The site already has seven friends, including city planner Mark (Paul Schneider), who Leslie is disappointed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> friends with many scantily clad young women. [...] Leslie and Ann (Rashida Jones) see Mark and other city planners drinking beer in the town hall courtyard. [...] Leslie describes it as the exclusive [...] "boys' club" [...] and proposes that she and Ann crash it.|$|E

500|$|Freedom From Want had {{previously}} been less entwined in the standard liberalism philosophies {{of the western world}} than the other three freedoms (speech, fear, and religion); this freedom added economic liberty as a societal aspiration. In his essay, Bulosan treats negative liberties as positive liberties by suggesting that Americans be [...] "given equal opportunity to serve themselves and each other according to their needs and abilities", an echo of Karl Marx's [...] "from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs". [...] In the final paragraph of the essay, the phrase [...] "The America we hope <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> not merely a physical but also a spiritual and intellectual world" [...] describes an egalitarian America. [...] In a voice likened to Steinbeck's in works such as The Grapes of Wrath, Bulosan's essay spoke up for those who struggled to survive in the capitalist democracy and was regarded as [...] "haunting and sharp" [...] against the backdrop of Rockwell's feast of plenty. It proposed that while citizens had obligations to the state, the state had an obligation to provide a basic level of subsistence. Unlike Roosevelt, Bulosan presented the case that the New Deal had not already granted freedom from want as it did not guarantee Americans the essentials of life.|$|E

[...] He added: [...] "There are few more powerful tools for promoting stability than the institution of marriage." [...] He added that [...] "The financial costs of family breakdown are incredibly high.

2500|$|The 1976 film The Town That Dreaded Sundown was {{released}} internationally and is {{loosely based on}} the events, despite its claim that [...] "only the names have been changed". Since the movie claimed that the [...] "story you are about <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> true, where it happened and how it happened," [...] the fabricated parts created much of the myth and folklore around the murders for several decades. A cold case in Texarkana in 1948 of the disappearance of Virginia Carpenter has been speculated to {{be the work of}} The Phantom. The 2014 book The Phantom Killer: Unlocking the Mystery of the Texarkana Serial Murders, by James Presley, pointed to Youell Swinney as the culprit of all five attacks.
