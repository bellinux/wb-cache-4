40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology to nominate and select <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> that {{are perceived as}} adding value to customers (both internal and external). The structure of the methodology can be explained in three "stages". First, the methodology suggests {{a new way of}} categorizing improvement opportunities, i. e. reactive-proactive, to "upgrade" the little Qbig Q categorisation. Then, it develops a roadmap that links performance indicators and <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> for both reactive and proactive improvements. Finally, it suggests an algorithm to select the <b>improvement</b> <b>project,</b> where the assessment of to what extent the nominated <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> add value to customers relies on the comparison between Overall Perceived Benefits (OPB) and Overall Perceived Efforts (OPE). The <b>improvement</b> <b>project</b> perceived as having the largest impact on adding value to customers receives the highest priority.

40|$|Deciding {{on which}} {{reliability}} & performance <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> to launch or to reject {{has historically been}} an extremely challenging responsibility of Teradyne management. Incorrect decisions can lead to major customer dissatisfaction, which may subsequently lead to loss of market share. Teradyne Engineering and Marketing team {{have been trying to}} develop a tool that would assist in their reliability <b>improvement</b> <b>project</b> decision making. The challenge is the dynamic aspects of the reliability <b>improvement</b> <b>projects.</b> Like most engineering <b>projects,</b> reliability <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> have variables such as internal workforce, productivity, skill sets, customer expectations and many others that are in constant motion. These variables make the assessment of reliability projects extremely difficult in a static framework. This research will incorporate these key variables into a dynamic framework to help assess individual reliability <b>improvement</b> <b>projects.</b> by Paul Devine. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|AbstractExcellence {{model can}} help the {{organization}} move forward {{in the right direction}} by providing solutions in the form of <b>improvement</b> <b>projects.</b> Lack of resources prevents organizations from implementing all <b>improvement’s</b> <b>projects</b> simultane-ously. Consequently, it seems necessary to make the optimal selection of the <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> proposed. According to the studies, unfortunately, there is no appropriate framework for the excellence model to prioritize <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> and make the optimal selection according to the organization’s policies and strategies. In this research, a hybrid fuzzy multiple criteria decision making is combined with the balanced scorecard for the optimal selection. Research method is of descriptive and applied type, and field method is used to collect data. The total study population is 30 people. The sample size is equal to the population size. The spatial scope of the research, with a period of 2011 to 2013, is limited to Calcimin Co. whose business is in the field of production of mineral products. The data collection instrument is a researcher-made questionnaire or interview. Data analysis is based on an integrated model of research, and Matlab, and SPSS software were used for the calculations. Based on calculations on the stages of the proposed model, the priority <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> and the <b>improvement</b> <b>project</b> of “Create a comprehensive marketing information system in the field of commerce ” were selected as the optimal <b>improvement</b> <b>project</b> that had the highest priority for implementation.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to create {{actionable}} knowledge, thereby supporting and stimulating practitioners to improve processes in the financial services sector. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on a case base of <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> in financial service organizations. The data consist of 181 <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> of processes in 14 financial service organizations executed between 2004 and 2010. Following the case-based reasoning approach, based on retrospective analysis of the documentation of these <b>improvement</b> <b>projects,</b> this paper aims to structure this knowledge in a way that supports practitioners in defining <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> in their own organizations. Findings - Identification of eight generic project definition templates, along with their critical to quality flowdowns and operational definitions. An overview of the distribution of <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> of each generic template over different departments and the average benefit per project for each department. The generic templates give people with knowledge about the process under improvement the ability to use their knowledge effectively in the form of an <b>improvement</b> <b>project.</b> Originality/value - Due to increasing international competition, financial service organizations must continuously improve in order to secure a competitive advantage. This paper turns continuous improvement from an abstract concept into something tangible and achievable, by giving practitioners with local knowledge tried and tested templates to identify promising themes for process improvement, and to make effective project definitions...|$|R

40|$|Background Preparing {{healthcare}} {{students for}} quality and service improvement is important internationally. A United Kingdom (UK) initiative aims to embed service improvement in pre-registration education. A UK university implemented service improvement teaching for all nursing students. In addition, the degree pathway students conducted service <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> {{as the basis}} for their dissertations. Aim The study aimed to evaluate the implementation of service <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> within a pre-registration nursing curriculum. Method A multi-method case study was conducted, using student questionnaires, focus groups with students and academic staff, and observation of action learning sets. Questionnaire data were analysed using SPSS v 19. Qualitative data were analysed using Ritchie and Spencer's (1994)) Framework Approach. Results Students were very positive about service improvement. The degree students, who conducted service <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> in practice, felt more knowledgeable than advanced diploma students. Selecting the project focus was a key issue and students encountered some challenges in practice. Support for student service <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> came from action learning sets, placement staff, and academic staff. Conclusion Service <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> had a positive effect on students' learning. An effective partnership between the university and partner healthcare organisations, and support for students in practice, is essential...|$|R

In this study we used the proactive analysis "Failure Mode Effects Criticality Analysis," a qualitative and quantitative risk management procedure; has calculated Priority Risk Index (PRI) for each activity of the process; have identified, on the PRI basis, the most critical activities and, for them, have defined improvement projects; and have recalculated the PRI after implementation of <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> for each activity. Time stop and audits are performed in order to control the new procedures. The results showed that the most critical tasks of "Magnetic Resonance Examination" process were the reception of the patient, the patient schedule drafting, the closing examination, and the organization of activities. Four <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> have been defined and executed. PRI evaluation after <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> implementation has shown that the risk decreased significantly following the implementation of procedures and controls defined in <b>improvement</b> <b>projects,</b> resulting in a reduction of the PRI between 43 % and 100 %...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} problem {{of this work}} is {{that in order for}} an <b>improvement</b> <b>project</b> to be perceived as successful from a stakeholder perspective their requirements would need to be understood {{at the outset of the}} <b>improvement</b> <b>project</b> and that where complexity includes multiple stakeholders, with a number of objectives, these would need to be identified and prioritised. In order to provide consistent results and sustained improvement, this action should be an explicit part of the improvement methodology utilised. The aim of the research is to provide a means of identifying and prioritising stakeholder requirement at the outset of an <b>improvement</b> <b>project,</b> such that in meeting the business needs the resulting outcome provides a ‘better fit’ solution for all stakeholders. The research objectives are: 1. To establish a methodology in order to represent all stakeholders to an improvement project; 2. To develop a methodology to determine the importance of the stakeholder requirements and their relative importance; 3. To develop a means of specifying the value desired by each stakeholder; 4. To design and test a methodology that is able to inform an <b>improvement</b> <b>project</b> such that the project outcomes are aligned to stakeholder requirements; 5. To determine the utility of this methodology in improving stakeholder satisfaction with project outcomes. An investigation into relevant literature, primary field work into the effects of <b>improvement</b> <b>projects,</b> stakeholder involvement, engagement and the capture of stakeholder value, and preliminary research into ten <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> across five different UK universities, engaged in the application of Lean thinking to service delivery, was undertaken. This led to the conception of an improvement methodology and the empirical development over three <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> resulting in the design of the Voice of [the] Stakeholder (VOS), a directed self-assessment model. End-to-end application of the VOS-Model to the final <b>improvement</b> <b>project</b> of the three demonstrated the validity of the model in identifying stakeholder requirements and value and the alignment of these with the final project outcome. The wider utility was established through the application of the VOS-model to four further <b>improvement</b> <b>projects.</b> The quantifiable project outcomes in each case demonstrated the utility of the model in the delivery of an improvement solution aligned to business needs, while the qualitative stakeholder feedback confirmed the applicability of the VOS-model in the capture and representation of stakeholder requirement and value...|$|R
