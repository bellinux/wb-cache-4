5|$|For centuries, in {{accordance}} with <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> Zeami, Noh costumes emulated the clothing that the characters would genuinely wear, such as the formal robes for a courtier and the street clothing for a peasant or commoner.

During the Edo (Tokugawa) period, the elaborate robes given to actors by noblemen and samurai in the Muromachi period were developed as costumes.|$|E

5|$|Critics who {{admire his}} middle work might {{characterize}} it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system {{he began to}} work out for himself {{under the influence of}} spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self and Soul.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that {{specially}} designed winter service vehicles are not available for plowing, other service or construction vehicles can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are graders, bulldozers, skid loaders, pickup trucks and rubbish trucks. Front-end loaders {{can also be used}} to plow snow. Either a snowplow attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> other road users.|$|E

5|$|Journeys {{story is}} told wordlessly through {{gameplay}} and using cutscenes. The player's character begins on a sand dune in a seemingly endless desert. In the far distance looms a large, foreboding mountain with a glowing crevice that splits its peak. As the character approaches the mountain, they find remnants of a once-thriving civilization, eroded by sand over time. Scattered throughout the ruins {{at the end of}} each area are stones at which the traveler rests; these stones give the traveler <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> meeting a larger, white-robed figure in a circular room, with art on the walls describing the rise and fall of the civilization mirroring the player's journey. The player must also contend with the ancient automatons left over from a war which ended the civilization, and which still roam the city looking for intruders.|$|E
5|$|Later, Suzuha Amane, Daru's future daughter, {{arrives in}} a time machine to tell Okabe {{that the only way}} to prevent a time-travel arms race leading to World War III is to prevent Kurisu's father Nakabachi from killing her and {{stealing}} her time travel theories. Suzuha and Okabe travel back in time, but Okabe accidentally kills Kurisu himself. Returning to the present, Okabe receives a message from his future self telling him that to escape the current timeline, he needs to save Kurisu while recreating <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the dead Kurisu that his past self saw. Traveling back in time again, he provokes Nakabachi into stabbing him, knocks Kurisu unconscious, and puts her in his pool of blood for his past self to see, causing the timeline to diverge into one where Kurisu lives and World War III does not occur.|$|E

Origins was generally positively reviewed, although some reviewers wrote that it followed the formula of the series too closely and failed to add anything new. Its PlayStation 2 port received a lower aggregate score, with criticism directed towards its visuals.|$|E

5|$|Symeon {{taught that}} putting oneself under the {{guidance}} of a spiritual father was essential for those who were serious about living the spiritual life. That relationship was a historical tradition especially prominent among the Desert Fathers, who defined the qualifications for acting in the role of a spiritual father: personal experience; an interior life; purity of heart; <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> God; insight; inspiration; discernment. Official ordination as a priest was not a requirement—Symeon's own spiritual father was a simple unordained monk who had many spiritual children. Symeon also taught that such teachers were empowered by their holiness to preach and to absolve others of their sins, a view that brought him into disagreement with church leaders of his time.|$|E
5|$|The {{book has}} also been seen {{as an attempt to}} redefine masculinity as a {{necessary}} step toward the abolition of slavery. In this view, abolitionists had begun to resist <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> aggressive and dominant men that the conquest and colonization of the early 19th century had fostered. In order to change the notion of manhood so that men could oppose slavery without jeopardizing their self-image or their standing in society, some abolitionists drew on principles of women's suffrage and Christianity as well as passivism, and praised men for cooperation, compassion, and civic spirit. Others within the abolitionist movement argued for conventional, aggressive masculine action. All the men in Stowe's novel are representations of either one kind of man or the other.|$|E
5|$|An ambitious leader, Artanis is the {{youngest}} templar to achieve the rank of praetor and executor. Artanis holds Tassadar in high esteem and despite being a strong believer in Khalai system, he also holds {{to the idea of}} reunification with the Nerazim and Tal'Darim. Artanis is responsible for the initial defense of Aiur alongside Fenix before being dispatched to arrest Tassadar by Aldaris; Artanis, however, sides with Tassadar and helps him defeat the Overmind. Artanis later organizes the evacuation of his now devastated home world of Aiur, and with Zeratul undertakes measures to cleanse the Zerg presence on Shakuras {{through the use of a}} Xel'Naga temple. When Sarah Kerrigan's actions result in the deaths of Aldaris, Fenix and Raszagal, Artanis commands a fleet to bring Kerrigan to justice on Char, and despite allying with both the Dominion and the UED remnants, his forces are defeated by her Zerg. Artanis returns to Shakuras to rebuild the Protoss civilization; with Zeratul having disappeared, Artanis becomes the hierarch of the unified Protoss Protectorate, the Daelaam, but struggles with reintegrating the two estranged branches of his people, with many of the Aiur survivors desiring to retake their home world. He makes a brief appearance in Wings of Liberty in <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the Protoss's last stand against the hybrids and their Zerg swarm.|$|E

5|$|Maribor's Academy is {{responsible}} for youth development at the club, {{with the goal of}} developing young players for the future. The academy is composed of eleven youth selections, ranging from U7 to U19. Totally, there are over 210 youth players in the system who are trained by professional staff within the club. <b>The</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the club and its youth system is not only to produce new players but also to prepare young children for the future and life without football. Therefore, each child {{who wants to be a}} member of the academy must also be successful not only on the football field, but also in the field of education. The club has also spread the football school activities to primary schools in the city of Maribor and the surrounding area, where around 500 of the youngest footballers train as part of the Children's Football School.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant envisaged Canberra one day {{becoming}} a university town like Oxford or Cambridge. A {{threat to the}} future of the University arose in the wake of the 1949 election, when the Liberal Party of Australia led by Robert Menzies won. Many Liberals were opposed to the University, which they saw as an extravagance. Menzies defended it, but in 1954 he announced that it had entered a period of consolidation, with a funding ceiling, ending the possibility of successful competition with universities in Europe and North America. A further blow came in 1959, when the Menzies government amalgamated it with the Canberra University College. Henceforth, it would no longer be a research university, but a regular one, with responsibility for teaching undergraduates. Nonetheless, parts of the university stayed committed to the old mission, and the ANU remained a university where research is central to its activities. Despite the setbacks, by 2014 <b>the</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> Canberra as a university town would be well on its way to {{becoming a}} reality.|$|E
