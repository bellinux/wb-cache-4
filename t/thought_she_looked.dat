500|$|Seymour {{was trained}} by The Fabulous Moolah in 1975 right after she {{finished}} high school. She was originally from Florida, but because Moolah <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> {{a little bit}} Hawaiian, Schroeder was given the ring name Leilani Kai. Her fellow wrestlers also bestowed upon her the nickname [...] "The Hawaiian Princess" [...] during her early career. Four weeks after beginning her training, Moolah sent her on a two-week tour of Alaska. Over {{the next few years}} she worked for promotions throughout the United States, including in Oklahoma, Minnesota, California, and New York. It was in 1979 in North Carolina, that Kai first began working with Judy Martin, who would be her future tag team partner.|$|E
500|$|Naomi and her storylines have {{received}} mostly positive attention from critics. Ahead of Naomi's on-screen introduction, TV Week's Rebecca Lake {{said it was}} about time the show got [...] "a new vixen" [...] and <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like quite a [...] "sexy character". Daniel Kilkelly (Digital Spy) believed Naomi was [...] "bound to stir up trouble" [...] following her arrival. Ben Pobjie from The Sydney Morning Herald commented that Naomi acted like [...] "an idiot" [...] during the painting storyline. While a reporter for What's on TV branded the character [...] "Naughty Naomi" [...] and thought she got [...] "the slap she so richly deserved from Sonya" [...] after she kissed Toadie. O'Reilly's co-star Eve Morey observed, [...] "Naomi is a femme fatale. She's opportunistic and manipulative." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arthur Lowe twice {{appeared}} on the BBC children's programme Blue Peter. The first time was with John Le Mesurier, {{in which the two}} appeared in costume and in character as Captain Mainwaring and Sergeant Wilson when walking around looking at and discussing a mural which schoolchildren had painted featuring the characters from the show at a Christmas party, among whom was Mainwaring's unseen wife Elizabeth â€“ or rather, what the children <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like (Mainwaring remarks [...] "Good grief. What a remarkable likeness!"). Arthur Lowe made a second appearance as Captain Mainwaring on Blue Peter with the Dad's Army van which would appear in the forthcoming London-Brighton run and showed presenter John Noakes the vehicle's hidden anti-Nazi defences.|$|E
60|$|Lucille {{remained}} {{for a moment}} deep in <b>thought.</b> Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up.|$|R
60|$|And {{his wife}} <b>thought,</b> as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at him, {{that she would}} like to see Mr. Parr try it, too.|$|R
5000|$|Ribbon {{wanted to}} get Chance's {{attention}}, but she moved on to get Real's attention after Chance <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like a man.|$|R
2500|$|Davis and Wyler {{frequently}} fought during filming, {{about everything}} from her appearance (Wyler <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like a Kabuki performer, but Davis wanted to look older than her age as the part was written for a 40-year-old) to the set design (which Davis thought was far too opulent for a family supposedly struggling financially) to her interpretation of the role (Wyler wanted a more feminine and sympathetic Regina, akin to Tallulah's interpretation). Davis had yielded to Wyler's demands during production of The Letter, {{but this time she}} held her ground. Not helping the situation was the fact Los Angeles was experiencing its worst heat wave in years, and the temperature on the soundstages regularly rose above 100 degrees. Davis finally walked off the picture. [...] "It was the only time in my career that I walked out on a film after the shooting had begun," [...] she later recalled. [...] "I was a nervous wreck {{due to the fact that}} my favorite and most admired director was fighting me every inch of the way ... I just didn't want to continue." [...] The actress retreated to her rented house in Laguna Beach and [...] "flatly refused to come back to work. It took a little courage, to say the least. Goldwyn had it in his power to sue me for the entire cost of the production." [...] A week later she returned to the set after rumors she would be replaced by Katharine Hepburn or Miriam Hopkins began to circulate, although Goldwyn was not about to bear the expense of scrapping all the footage with Davis and refilming the scenes with a new actress. Even though the film was a critical and commercial success and nominated for nine Academy Awards, she and Wyler never worked together again.|$|E
60|$|Some {{days later}} she met Mrs. Graham at the post-office and inquired about her husband. Geraldine <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> anxious.|$|E
60|$|Louise {{was both}} {{astonished}} and disappointed, {{but after a}} little <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> after the departing agent with a shrewd smile.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next few}} days seemed years for length: but she could wait. She was sure of him now. She needed no charms. [...] "Perhaps," [...] <b>thought</b> <b>she,</b> as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> in the glass, [...] "I was my own charm." [...] And, indeed, she had every fair right to say so.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> wasn't <b>looking</b> {{well when}} <b>she</b> {{was at the}} office to-day. And so I thought I would come rather than send," [...] Corey {{explained}} in his turn.|$|R
6000|$|Gudruda {{covered her}} eyes with her hand and <b>thought.</b> Presently <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up quickly. [...] "I seem to see guile here," [...] she said. [...] "Now look {{narrowly}} on thy shoes." ...|$|R
60|$|MISS HENRIETTA. I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> taller. I {{meant to}} say so. Phoebe, 'twas the cloak deceived us. We could not see her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{very elegant}} lady," [...] Holderness remarked, [...] "but I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> a bit {{up in the}} air. Did you notice her pearls, Victor?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then Carmen {{flung the}} last of her {{self-control}} away. Her eyes flashed and Foster <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like a wild cat as she indulged her savage rage.|$|E
60|$|Mademoiselle Lange {{was sitting}} upon a small sofa of antique design, with {{cushions}} covered in faded silks heaped round her pretty head. Armand <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like that carved cameo which his sister Marguerite possessed.|$|R
6000|$|She {{held out}} her hand rather coldly, scrutinising my face as she did so. I prepared, with a new-won grace, to walk by her side. [...] "Egbert," [...] she said, {{standing}} still, and <b>thought.</b> Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at me.|$|R
60|$|The bishop, however, <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> {{very like}} an angel and, {{accepting}} the proffered seat, sat down beside her. He uttered some platitude as to his deep obligation for the trouble she had taken, and wondered more and more who she was.|$|R
60|$|She did not {{immediately}} withdraw the hand she had given him. He was grateful to her and <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> unusually pretty with the sympathy shining in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|Harding {{waited for}} a while before he went back. He found Mrs. Mowbray alone on his arrival, and <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> anxious when he asked how Lance was getting on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] he said, {{and she did}} not {{immediately}} withdraw the hand she had given him. He was grateful to her, and <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> unusually pretty with the sympathy shining in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth {{gazed into}} the fire for several moments, and Philip watched her. It was a woman's face, grave and thoughtful, a little perturbed just then, as though by some unwelcome <b>thought.</b> Presently <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> back at him, {{looked into his eyes}} long and earnestly.|$|R
60|$|Alice smiled, but he <b>thought</b> the <b>look</b> <b>she</b> {{gave him}} hinted at approval.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} but laugh, too, as I {{admitted}} that she was, indeed, a barbarian. She was not offended, taking the matter as a huge joke. But some time thereafter she sat in silence, apparently deep in <b>thought.</b> Finally <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up at me, her strong white teeth gleaming behind her smiling lips.|$|R
60|$|I did as desired, Mary {{watching}} the process with interested and, {{at the same}} time, amused eyes. I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> as sorry as I felt myself when that lank, villanous wig was again performing its office.|$|E
60|$|I {{wondered}} how I could have <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> white, or anything but burning red, when she answered {{that she had}} had it safe, a little while ago, she thought, but it was not worth looking for.|$|E
60|$|Three {{weeks later}} Andrew sailed, {{and soon after}} he had done so Wannop called one {{afternoon}} at The Firs, where he was received by Mrs. Olcott in the garden. He <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> harassed, but he had expected this.|$|E
60|$|I foresaw that {{it would}} be {{difficult}} to make my exit with dignity, and I wished to goodness that I had not returned to London till Mrs. Strickland had composed her difficulties. I stole a glance at her. She was immersed in <b>thought.</b> Presently <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up at me, sighed deeply, and smiled.|$|R
6000|$|He was {{not going}} in the same breath; but he had risen before the girl entered, and <b>she</b> evidently <b>thought</b> he was. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> quickly at him, and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|Descending the stairs, {{on her way}} to the house-keeper's room, {{she passed}} by the entrances to two long stone {{corridor}}s, with rows of doors opening on them; one corridor situated on the second, and one on the first floor of the house. [...] "Many rooms!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at the doors. [...] "Weary work searching here for what I have come to find!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Thirlwell saw {{no more of}} {{her during}} the day, but she {{came down to the}} beach in the evening and he gave her another lesson. As they paddled home he <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> tired, and asked: [...] "Where have you been since morning?" ...|$|E
60|$|The girl made {{a sign to}} him {{to follow}} her, and, {{throwing}} open a door, nodded to him to go in. He would have lingered a moment, for he <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> sad, but dared not do so, for fear of the old man's anger.|$|E
60|$|As usual, I found Betty in the pineland. I <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> rather {{pale and}} dull...fretting about Frank no doubt. She brightened {{up when she}} saw me, evidently expecting that I had come to {{straighten}} matters out; but she pretended to be haughty and indifferent.|$|E
60|$|The {{poor girl}} stopped speaking, {{and put her}} hand to her brow as if to {{restrain}} the tumult of her <b>thoughts.</b> Then, suddenly, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up with a wild yet intelligent smile.|$|R
50|$|Lancaster was {{struggling}} throughout her life. <b>She</b> had suicidal <b>thoughts.</b> <b>She</b> also was <b>looked</b> upon from other {{players on the}} field because she stood out as 6 feet tall and as 63 years old.|$|R
60|$|Her mood had {{not changed}} when David came to see her next morning, to admit, too, that Tommy seemed to have done an unselfish thing in concealing his illness from them. Grizel nodded, but he <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was <b>looking</b> strangely reckless. He had a message from Elspeth. Tommy {{had asked her to}} let him know whether the plant was flourishing.|$|R
