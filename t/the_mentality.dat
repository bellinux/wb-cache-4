40|$|The {{study is}} part of an ampler {{research}} focusing on the issue of <b>the</b> <b>mentalities</b> (collective imaginary), seculariza- tion and the theory of the cultural models. The interre- latedness of these theoretical topics is approached on the basis provided by the qualitative analysis data, and attempts to demonstrate the variety of the consequences in the secularization process within culture, regarding them as seminal premises of producing novelty and dif- ference. However, secularization is assessed on a com- parative basis, in accordance with the rise and develop- ment of present-day religiosity. Cultural models face on- going revision, reflecting the changes going on within the frame of <b>the</b> <b>mentalities</b> or <b>the</b> collective imaginary. Though the cultural model tends to embody the most feasible (pragmatic) representation of the imaginary, contextuality, contingency and historicity are part in the ultimate shaping of the model...|$|R

25|$|Barruel's polemic is an {{important}} source for the understanding of <b>the</b> <b>mentality</b> of the opponents of the French Revolution and {{their understanding of the}} ideological origins of the Revolution. Furthermore, Barruel is also seen as the father of a modern conspiracy theory. The Memoirs contain all of the elements that continue to characterize conspiracy narratives today including the argument that a hidden group is orchestrating world events behind the scenes and an attempt to construct a direct lineage from the past to the present. Barruel presents a thorough application of conspiracy theory methodology. As a result, he has had a lasting influence on following generations.|$|E
