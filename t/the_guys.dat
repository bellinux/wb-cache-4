25|$|Al Pacino as Carlito Brigante. Pacino came to Carlito's Way {{directly}} from his Oscar-winning role in Scent of a Woman.

The black leather coat just fit into the period setting.|$|E

25|$|Grisettes {{appeared}} in many caricatures of bohemian Paris, {{most notably in}} those by Daumier and Gavarni, {{as well as in}} illustrations of novels about them, such as Gerald du Maurier's own engravings for Trilby. The artist and war correspondent, Constantin Guys, frequently portrayed them in his sketches of Parisian life during the Second French Empire. A grisette likewise became the subject of one of Edward Hopper's early watercolours, painted in Paris in 1906. Hopper's portrayal, like several of those by Guys, shows the grisette wearing a traditional seamstress apron. However, their slightly raised skirts (particularly in <b>the</b> <b>Guys</b> sketches) and provocative poses also allude to the association of grisettes with prostitution.|$|E

Some of his characters are loosely referenced from the Bible, non-fiction books, and mythology, and he created a world with a war being waged between three major factions (angels, devils, and fallen angels) with Rias being a devil. In Volume 5 of the light novels, Ishibumi writes that he likes to pair the main characters: Rias and Akeno are the big sister duo, Asia and Xenovia are the church-related duo who become friends, Gasper and Koneko are the young first-years, and Issei and Yuto are <b>the</b> <b>guys.</b>|$|E

Thus the bottom part of <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> is vertical and does not obstruct headroom, so a sidewalk can pass between the pole and <b>the</b> <b>guy.</b>|$|R

25|$|As a cricketer he was {{the most}} talented player of my time, a guy who had {{extraordinary}} talents in every facet of cricket. In hindsight he probably didn't reach the heights that he should have, based on his cricket ability, but <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> who played with him and against him will recognise he was a fantastic player, who was dynamic in anything he did in cricket. When he was on he was unplayable. He bowled a swinging ball, he could hit the ball a mile, throw it like a bullet and he was a fantastic catcher either close to the wicket or in the outfield â€“ a supreme cricketer. He was a very popular person, Gus, a bit of a larrikin and very much liked by everyone. He didn't take life all that seriously, played for the enjoyment of it.|$|E

Eventually the drive became too costly, and he moved to Fresno to practice with the band.|$|E
