5|$|Re-wilding cattle, which {{involves}} increasing the natural protective tendencies of cattle, {{is a method}} for controlling coyotes discussed by Temple Grandin of Colorado State University. This method is gaining popularity among producers who allow their herds to calve on <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>and</b> whose cattle graze open pastures throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|There are six {{recognised}} subspecies, {{although the}} differences are mainly clinal; birds become smaller and paler in the east of <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>and</b> the males have larger white wing spots. Birds of intermediate appearance occur where the subspecies' ranges overlap.|$|E
5|$|A. p. kleinschmidti is {{sometimes}} {{merged with the}} nominate form, A. p. petrosus. The suggested subspecies A. p. meinertzhageni on South Uist, A. p. hesperianus on the Isle of Arran, and A. p. ponens in northwestern France cannot be reliably separated from the nominate form. There is a geographical trend in appearance, with longer-billed, darker birds at {{the western end of}} <b>the</b> <b>range,</b> <b>and</b> shorter-billed, paler individuals in the east.|$|E

5|$|Between 17:48 and 17:52, Posen and ten other German battleships {{engaged the}} British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, though <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>and</b> poor {{visibility}} prevented effective fire. Shortly thereafter, two British destroyers— and —came under intense {{fire from the}} German line. Posen fired at Nestor with both her main battery and secondary guns. At 18:35, Nestor exploded and sank under the combined fire of eight battleships. By 20:15, the German fleet had faced the Grand Fleet {{for a second time}} and was forced to turn away; in doing so, the order of the German line was reversed. Posen was now the fourth ship in the line, astern of her three sisters.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} cost-effective, reliable, sustainable, and {{environmentally}} friendly, but {{has historically been}} limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>and</b> size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|In September 1956, the RAF {{received}} its first Vulcan B.1, XA897, which immediately embarked upon a round-the-world tour. The tour {{was to be}} an important demonstration of <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>and</b> capabilities of the aircraft, but it also had other benefits in the form of conducting goodwill visits in various countries; in later life Vulcans routinely visited various nations and distant parts of the former British Empire as a show of support and military protection. This first tour, however, was struck by misfortune; on 1 October 1956, while landing in bad weather at London Heathrow Airport at the completion of the world tour, XA897 was destroyed in a fatal accident.|$|E

5|$|MAR {{operated}} in two modes, surveillance, and engagement. In surveillance mode, the range was maximized, and each face performed a scan in about 5seconds. Returns were fed into systems that automatically extracted <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>and</b> velocity, {{and if the}} return was deemed interesting, the system automatically began a track for threat verification. During the threat verification phase, the radar spent more time examining the returns {{in an effort to}} accurately determine the trajectory and then ignored any objects that would fall outside its area.|$|E
5|$|Measurements for the russet sparrow vary geographically, {{between the}} three {{subspecies}}, and also within the Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus. The subspecies cinnamomeus is generally larger than the others, and within this form {{there is a tendency}} for birds at higher altitudes to be larger, and a clinal variation in size with the smallest birds in the west of <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>and</b> the largest in the east.|$|E
5|$|Range {{queries are}} also straightforward. Once {{the ranks of}} the two values are known, the number of {{elements}} {{greater than or equal to}} the first value and less than the second is the difference of the two ranks. This count can be adjusted up or down by one according to whether the endpoints of the range should be considered to be part of <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>and</b> whether the array contains keys matching those endpoints.|$|E

50|$|On the PC (DOS and Microsoft Windows platforms), two {{encodings}} became {{established for}} Japanese and Traditional Chinese {{in which all}} of singletons, lead units and trail units overlapped: Shift-JIS and Big5 respectively.

5|$|The Australian magpie prefers open {{areas such}} as grassland, fields and {{residential}} {{areas such as}} parks, gardens, golf courses, and streets, with scattered trees or forest nearby. Birds nest and shelter in trees but forage mainly {{on the ground in}} these open areas. It has also been recorded in mature pine plantations; birds only occupy rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest in the vicinity of cleared areas. In general, evidence suggests <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>and</b> population of the Australian magpie has increased with land-clearing, although local declines in Queensland due to a 1902 drought, and in Tasmania in the 1930s have been noted; the cause for the latter is unclear but rabbit baiting, pine tree removal, and spread of the masked lapwing (Vanellus miles) have been implicated.|$|E
5|$|The Borodino {{class were}} {{originally}} fitted with Liuzhol stadiametric rangefinders that used the angle between two vertical points on an enemy ship, usually the waterline and the crow's nest, {{to estimate the}} range. The gunnery officer consulted his references to get <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>and</b> calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target. He then transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical fire-control transmission system to each gun or turret. While fitting out, these rangefinders were replaced on the first four ships by two Barr and Stroud coincidence rangefinders that used two images {{that had to be}} superimposed to derive the range. Perepelkin telescopic sights were also installed for their guns, but their crews were not trained in how to use them.|$|E

5|$|The Cunningham–Rawnsley team {{used the}} AI {{specifically}} to position themselves directly astern and underneath the enemy. Although the German bombers carried a dorsal gunner, {{it was difficult}} to locate an enemy against the black colour of the landscape. Usually the blackness of the country would swallow up the outline of an approaching night fighter. As they approached, the slipstream of the enemy could prove hazardous; bucking the Beaufighter and throwing the pilot off his aim. Approaching from slightly below allowed the attacking pilot to avoid the slipstream. The tactics allowed for Cunningham to close <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>and</b> fire first, which was usually sufficient to end the engagement quickly and successfully. Bob Braham, a rival night fighter ace, also used this tactic.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began as}} a {{long-range}} gunnery duel, during which the Russian ships hit the Japanese ships numerous times and forced Tōgō to temporarily disengage. Over two hours {{after the start of}} the battle, the Japanese fleet closed <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>and</b> started shooting again at 17:35. Forty minutes later a shell struck Retzivans forward turret near the gun ports, killing one turret crewman and wounding six others from the blast pressure. The impact knocked one 12-inch shell off its loading tray, crushing two other sailors and also setting fire to the canvas covering the gun ports. Fearing that the fire might spread, the surviving crewmen flooded the turret, knocking out its electrical system. The crew was able to get the turret partially functional within an hour.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist wields four {{different}} styles of weapons throughout the game: sword, spear, axe, and bazooka. Almost all swords, axes, and spears have four versions, and repeated use of them can increase their skill levels {{to a maximum of}} three, unlocking a new charged attack with each level. <b>The</b> <b>range</b> <b>and</b> power of each type of weapon increased the more it is used; for instance, spears at a high enough level may be thrown at an enemy across the screen, while the swords and axes can cut swathes of destruction around the boy's vicinity. With the exception of the Bone Crusher, all swords, axes, and spears can cut through vegetation; some weapons are required to break rocks and other barriers.|$|E

Air-to-air refuelling is considered a force multiplier, permitting the RAAF to increase <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>and</b> loiter time of its aircraft.
