500|$|In late March, VIII Corps {{advanced}} eastward through Eisenach {{and then}} across the Fulda River. Here some of Middleton's infantrymen {{came across the}} concentration camp at Ohrdruf, discovering the sickening evidence of what had transpired there. Middleton called Patton to come <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look,</b> <b>and</b> Patton was joined by Bradley and Eisenhower. [...] In his diary, Patton described the place as [...] "one of the most appalling sights that I have ever seen." [...] This was the first Nazi concentration camp to be discovered by the United States Army, and Eisenhower cabled Marshall to get a delegation from congress over to witness and communicate what took place there. Middleton later had officials from the town come in to witness {{what was going on}} in their midst. While every one of them denied knowing what was happening, the mayor and his wife both committed suicide that night.|$|E
2500|$|The {{criminal}} {{case against the}} men charged has been met with strong criticism as well as conflict between members of the prosecution, complicating the investigation. District Attorney Matt Stowe was elected to office {{in the summer of}} 2014 following the arrests and stated that he believes he was elected in part due to skepticism regarding the arrests and questions over whether enough evidence exists against them to obtain a conviction. [...] " [...] wanted another set of eyes on this Holly Bobo case; they weren't happy with everything that was coming out of there, and I think that they wanted someone else to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> someone else to say, 'We know what's going on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> {{see what}} a {{spectacle}} he has made of himself. He'd better be sent home at once or he will disgrace the family by looking as if he'd been in a row." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{he put up}} his turnip. Then he {{see another}} clock, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>look,</b> <b>and</b> it was <b>an</b> hour fast too. That puzzled him.|$|R
6000|$|Away off {{now we see}} {{a little}} hill, a-standing up just {{on the edge of}} the world. Tom broke off his talk, and reached for a glass very much excited, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>look,</b> <b>and</b> says: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Maybe it's all right, but I'll <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> make sure," [...] he told himself, and {{excused himself}} to a girl to whom he had been talking. As he hurried across the lawn he passed Phil.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes. I've got {{a little}} shack back here in the bush a hundred yards, and a pretty spring, and a few fruit trees and berry bushes. Come in and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look.</b> <b>And</b> that spring is a dandy. You never tasted water like it. Come in and try it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, guess I {{better do}} that. Excuse me a second. Then how about {{grabbing}} a taxi (Gosh, isn't it the limit {{the way these}} taxi shuffers skin around a corner? Got more nerve driving than I have!) and going up to your flat for a while? Like to meet your friends--must be fine women--and I might <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> see how Hugh sleeps. Like to know how he breathes. Don't think he has adenoids, but I better make sure, eh?" [...] He patted her shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> around <b>and</b> report again to-morrow," [...] {{returned}} Captain Putnam; {{and then}} closed his desk slowly and thoughtfully.|$|R
60|$|Every one <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>look,</b> <b>and</b> then Dan {{showed them}} the lovely plumage on a moth's wing, the four {{feathery}} corners to a hair, the veins on a leaf, hardly {{visible to the naked}} eye, but like a thick net through the wonderful little glass; the skin on their own fingers, looking like queer hills and valleys; a cobweb like a bit of coarse sewing silk, and the sting of a bee.|$|R
60|$|At last I give in, <b>and</b> went <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> myself; <b>and</b> it {{was just}} as Tom said--there wasn't a sign of a corpse.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are friends}} of the Ford family; we can easily prove that, too," [...] added Jack. [...] "Mr. Ford and his wife both asked us, {{when we were in}} this vicinity, to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> see if {{everything}} was all right. We found a strange man in the mansion and we did our best to catch him, but he got away. What we want you to do is to get busy and try to catch that rascal. If you don't do it, we'll make a complaint against you for neglect of duty." ...|$|E
60|$|The boy {{bent his}} steps to his employer's, {{as has been}} said. In {{his way down the}} village street he had to pass a public house, the only one the place contain'd; and when he came off against it he heard the sound of a fiddle--drown'd, however, at intervals, by much {{laughter}} and talking. The windows were up, and, the house standing close to the road, Charles thought it no harm to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> {{see what was going on}} within. Half a dozen footsteps brought him to the low casement, on which he lean'd his elbow, and where he had a full view of the room and its occupants. In one corner was an old man, known in the village as Black Dave--he it was whose musical performances had a moment before drawn Charles's attention to the tavern; and he it was who now exerted himself in a violent manner to give, with divers flourishes and extra twangs, a tune very popular among that thick-lipp'd race whose fondness for melody is so well known. In the middle of the room were five or six sailors, some of them quite drunk, and others in the earlier stages of that process, while on benches around were more sailors, and here and there a person dress'd in landsman's attire. The men in the middle of the room were dancing; that is, they were going through certain contortions and shufflings, varied occasionally by exceeding hearty stamps upon the sanded floor. In short the whole party were engaged in a drunken frolic, which was in no respect different from a thousand other drunken frolics, except, perhaps, that there was less than the ordinary amount of anger and quarreling. Indeed everyone seem' d in remarkably good humor.|$|E

50|$|At the {{printing}} press, Betty <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> gives her approval, and even <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> {{photo of her}} with the cover. But when she returns to Mode and hears about a devastating tornado in Kansas, she realizes that they can't go to print because the cover featuring a fashion tornado would trivialize the tragedy in the heartland. As Betty begs Phil to stop the issue, Phil says that he can't do it unless Daniel and Wilhelmina say so.|$|R
60|$|He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> long <b>look,</b> <b>and</b> said it {{was like}} a black string {{stretched}} across the sand, but he couldn't guess what it was.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} had better <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> around <b>and</b> see just how much is missing," [...] advised Phil. [...] "The thief may have cleaned us out more than we imagine." ...|$|R
50|$|Once in the village, {{the local}} elder, Dhun, {{tells of a}} 'deovel' whose {{mischief}} has become a problem, but under no circumstances should the creature be killed. Despite Dandelion's claims {{that there are no}} devils, Geralt agrees to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> see what he can do.|$|E
5000|$|The North Dock Tufa was {{discovered}} behind some old huts in 1992, when Tyne and Wear Development Corporation {{began work on}} developing Sunderland marina. Geologists from Sunderland Museum and Sunderland University were called in to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> identified it as a “calcareous tufa dome.” ...|$|E
50|$|Ganor {{noticed the}} unusual {{scale of the}} walls at Khirbet Qeiyafa while patrolling the area in 2003. Three years later he persuaded Garfinkel to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look,</b> <b>and,</b> after a {{preliminary}} dig in 2007, they began work in earnest {{in the summer of}} 2008. They have excavated only 4 percent of the six-acre settlement so far.|$|E

6000|$|... "Then," [...] he responded, [...] "I'll <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> around, <b>and</b> you {{had better}} start off the first thing to-morrow and hurry those {{castings}} on. There's a good deal to be done if we're to get away when Carsley turns up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most {{likely a}} remnant of that old gang from Jordan Creek. I knew they would spring up again, even after Sol Davids was lynched. Let us <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> around, <b>and</b> see if we can't find some clew to their identity." ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{beautiful}} mosaic {{has been}} a much-loved feature of our High Street for the past 17 years, but unless you're a historian the chances are you would not know what all of the intricate panels mean.

5000|$|A plaque {{describing}} the panels {{was installed in}} 2011, and unveiled by Councillor Graham Tope, Executive Member for Community Safety, Leisure and Libraries, who said: [...] This beautiful mosaic has been a much-loved feature of our High Street for the past 17 years, but unless you're a historian the chances are you would not know what all of the intricate panels mean.

50|$|In {{the early}} eighties, Moore {{released}} her two first albums, <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>Look</b> <b>and</b> You Won't Find Me There. Both albums were critically acclaimed, but record label problems put an early end to her budding career. However, in 1988, Moore was tapped {{to be the}} voice of Sister Mary on Queensrÿche's concept album Operation: Mindcrime. It became a commercial success, {{and as a result}} started performing live with them. In the late 1990s, she became the singer for the band Radar and relocated to New York City to record their 2000 debut album, R.P.M. After Radar disbanded in 2001, Moore moved back to Seattle.|$|E
