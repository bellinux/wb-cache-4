The day after the revolution broke out, revolutionaries began flying their own flag, clearly influenced by the colours chosen by the Brabant Revolution of 1789. The colours (red, yellow and black) today form the national flag of Belgium. Some historians have also argued that the Vonckists and Statists were the forerunners of the major political factions, the Liberals and the Catholics, which would dominate Belgian politics after independence.|$|E

William I rejected his son's advice to negotiate with the rebels, forcing them towards a more radical, pro-independence stance, and sent a large military force to Brussels suppress the insurrection.|$|E

40|$|A 3 D {{mathematical}} model <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ordered nanostructured cathode catalyst layer (CCL) {{has been developed}} for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. In an ordered nanostructured CCL, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are used as support materia for Pt catalyst, upon which <b>a</b> thin layer <b>of</b> proton-conducting polymer (Nafion) is deposited, which are then aligned along the main transport direction (perpendicular to the membrane) of various species. The model considers all the relevant processes in different phases <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ordered nanostructured CCL. In addition, the effect of Knudsen diffusion is accounted in the model. The model can predict not only <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ordered nanostructured CCL at various operating and design conditions but also can predict the distributions of various fields in different phases <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ordered nanostructured CCL. The predicted nanostructured CCL performance with estimated membrane overpotential is validated with measured data found in the literature, and a good agreement is obtained between the model prediction and measured result.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{methods of}} modeling and predicting face recognition (FR) system performance based on analysis of similarity scores. We define <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> FR system as its recognition accuracy, {{and consider the}} intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting its <b>performance.</b> <b>The</b> intrinsic factors <b>of</b> <b>an</b> FR system include the gallery images, the FR algorithm, and the tuning parameters. The extrinsic factors include mainly query image conditions. For performance modeling, we propose the concept of “perfect recognition, ” based on which a performance metric is extracted from perfect recognition similarity scores (PRSS) to relate <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> FR system to its intrinsic factors. <b>The</b> PRSS <b>performance</b> metric allows tuning FR algorithm parameters offline for near optimal <b>performance.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> metric extracted from query images is used to adjust face alignment parameters online for improved performance. For online prediction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> FR system on query images, features are extracted from the actual recognition similarity scores and their corresponding PRSS. Using such features, we can predict online if an individual query image can be correctly matched by the FR system, based on which we can reduce the incorrect match rates. Experimental results demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> FR system can be significantly improved using the presented methods.

40|$|This paper {{constitutes}} <b>a</b> study <b>of</b> several {{classical and}} original methods for <b>a</b> speaker adaptation <b>of</b> the acoustic hidden Markov models <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{automatic speech recognition}} system (ASRS). Most of today’s real applications require that the speaker adaptation process continuously improves <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying ASRS, as more utter-ances are pronounced by a new speaker. The {{first part of this}} article is dedicated to this problem. We begin by introducing the Structural EigenVoices approach (SEV). Compared to EigenVoices (EV), SEV improves <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ASRS with more sentences, well beyond the point where the EV system has reached its limit. We then describe four methods that combine the advantages of Structural Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (SMLLR) and EigenVoices-based techniques (EV or SEV). We show experimentally that one of them, SEV→SMLLR, can improve <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ASRS at least as significantly as SMLLR, EV and SEV, irre-spective of the amount of adaptation utterances used. The second part of our work is focused on the use of genetic algorithms for rapidly adapting acoustic models. Whereas all of the standard adaptation methods (e. g. SM-LLR, SMAP, EV, etc.) are based on the E. -M. procedure and thus provide a single local optimal solution, genetic algorithms are theoretically able to provide several global optimal solutions. We experimentally show that: (1) genetic algorithms and EV both equivalently improve <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ASRS, and (2) combining genetic algorithms and EV further improves <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ASRS...|$|R
