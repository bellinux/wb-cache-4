25|$|For a given {{quantity}} of a consumer good, the {{point on the}} demand curve indicates the value, or marginal utility, to consumers for that unit. It measures what the consumer would be prepared <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> unit. The corresponding point on the supply curve measures marginal cost, the increase in total cost to the supplier for the corresponding unit of the good. The price in equilibrium is determined by supply and demand. In a perfectly competitive market, supply and demand equate marginal cost and marginal utility at equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|The stadium {{does not}} have a {{retractable}} roof, though one was considered initially. Such a roof was cited to add $100 million to the total budget and none of the parties (Twins, Hennepin County or Minnesota Legislature) were willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> cost. Much like other northern cities with outdoor professional baseball (i.e. Chicago, Detroit, Boston, Cleveland, New York), the weather in Minneapolis during a 162-game baseball season and playoffs can vary from early-spring snow to rain and hot, humid weather. The Metrodome was climate-controlled, and thus, protected the baseball schedule during the entire time that it had been the venue for the Minnesota Twins. However, many Twins fans and baseball purists argue that this same sterile, climate-controlled environment creates a less-than-desirable atmosphere for watching baseball. The architect also tested the feasibility of heated seats.|$|E
2500|$|... "If {{the amount}} of a public good can be varied continuously, the optimal {{quantity}} to produce is that quantity for which the marginal cost of the last unit is just equal to {{the sum of the}} prices that all consumers would be willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> unit." [...] This equilibrium guarantees that the last unit of the public good costs as much to produce as the value that it gives to all of its consumers.|$|E

He should pay for it. He's got the money." [...] Fox went on to call Trump a [...] "crazy guy" [...] and a [...] "false prophet," [...] and questioned the claim that Trump received 44% of the Hispanic vote in the Republican caucus in Nevada. Trump took to Twitter in response, demanding that Fox apologize for using [...] "the F word while discussing the wall." [...] Fox eventually apologized for the remark, while also asking for Trump to apologize for his remarks about Mexicans and inviting Trump to visit Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|EMS {{services}} in Canada are generally funded, {{at least in}} part, and to varying degrees, by the Ministry of Health or Health Department of the province or territory in which they operate. Paramedics and ambulance services are {{not mentioned in the}} Canada Health Act, and are therefore not an insured service. [...] Provinces may choose to subsidize some of the cost, usually just for patients with valid provincial health cards. Health insurance in Canada is universal and publicly funded, so the cost of emergency ambulance services is covered to some degree. The degree to which individual use of EMS is subsidized by provincial health insurance varies by province, and may be supplemented either by partial fees for service, or by the property tax revenues of municipalities operating such services. In some jurisdictions, funding is at 100 per cent, and occurs without the patient being aware of its existence. Other jurisdictions fund at varying levels, but may require payment up front. In most cases this is later reimbursed. [...] This may be particularly true of out of jurisdiction services, with an individual from one province who requires EMS service in another province being required <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> service and then submit the receipt to their own provincial health insurance scheme for reimbursement. In some jurisdictions, such as Ontario, a deterrent fee scheme is used to discourage the medically unnecessary use of EMS by the public. In such cases, the provincial health insurance scheme pays the majority of the cost of EMS service (around 80 per cent) for medically necessary EMS service, but when a physician decides that the service was not medically necessary, they can cause the patient to pay the full, uninsured amount of the charge, with the patient receiving a bill for the additional deterrent fee at some point after the emergency is over. [...] Within Ontario, for example, such deterrent billing occurs through the receiving hospital, {{despite the fact that the}} hospital neither provides nor oversees EMS in most cases.|$|E
