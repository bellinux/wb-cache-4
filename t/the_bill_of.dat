5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection of some of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights {{to state and local}} governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E

5|$|Black's view on {{due process}} drew from his reading of British history; to him, due process meant all persons {{were to be}} tried in {{accordance}} with <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights' procedural guarantees and in accordance with constitutionally pursuant laws. Black advocated equal treatment by the government for all persons, regardless of wealth, age, or race. Black's view of due process was restrictive {{in the sense that}} it was premised on equal procedures; it did not extend to substantive due process. This was in accordance with Black's literalist views. Black did not tie procedural due process exclusively to <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights, but he did tie it exclusively to <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights combined with other explicit provisions of the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|The First Amendment {{guarantees}} {{the rights of}} freedom of speech and peaceable assembly, among others. While not explicitly mentioned, the Supreme Court has held that the right to assembly includes the freedom of association, particularly political association. These protections not only prohibit the government from passing laws which infringe upon these rights, but also from taking actions which would violate them. While <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights—which includes the First Amendment—applied originally only to the federal government, the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed for the application of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights to the states under the incorporation doctrine.|$|E

5|$|In December 1689, Parliament passed one of {{the most}} {{important}} constitutional documents in English history, <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights. This measure—which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right—established restrictions on the royal prerogative; it declared, among other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments. <b>The</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights also confirmed the succession to the throne. Following the death of either William III or Mary II, the other was to continue to reign. Next in the line of succession would be any children of the couple, to be followed by Mary's sister Anne and her children. Last in the line of succession stood any children William III might have had from any subsequent marriage.|$|E

40|$|State <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> rights preceded <b>the</b> federal <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights. From June 1776, {{when the}} Virginia Declaration of Rights (<b>the</b> first state <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> rights) was adopted, until December 1791, when <b>the</b> federal <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights was ratified, eight states each adopted a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> {{rights as a}} {{separate}} part of their state constitution. State constitutional rights existed even before there as a United States Constitution. Furthermore, <b>the</b> federal <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights contains provisions derived from earlier state <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> rights. Indeed, virtually every guarantee in <b>the</b> federal <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights {{can be traced to}} a similar guarantee in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> rights adopted in the states during the War of Independence or shortly thereafter. It is likely that the framers of the Constitution thought that the first bulwark of defense {{for the protection of the}} rights of citizens would be state <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> rights. One reason given at the 1787 Convention for not adding a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> rights to <b>the</b> completed Constitution was that <b>the</b> state <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> rights remained undisturbed and were 2 ̆ 2 sufficient 2 ̆ 2 to protect against oppression by government...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights is {{the first}} ten {{amendments}} to the United States Constitution. Proposed following the oftentimes bitter 1787–88 battle over ratification of the U.S. Constitution, and crafted to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people. The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those found in several earlier documents, including the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the English Bill of Rights 1689, along with earlier documents such as Magna Carta (1215). In practice, the amendments had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first 150 years after ratification.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights was {{originally}} proposed to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification. Initially, the First Amendment {{applied only to}} laws enacted by the Congress, {{and many of its}} provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today. Beginning with Gitlow v. New York (1925), the Supreme Court applied the First Amendment to states—a process known as incorporation—through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The Due Process Clause prohibits {{state and}} local {{government}} officials from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without legislative authorization.
