2500|$|On Sunday, November 21, {{a hunting}} party of about 15 {{people were in}} a cabin on this private land. [...] Terry Willers, {{one of the two}} co-owners of the land, left the cabin and saw Vang sitting in a deer stand. He used a {{handheld}} radio to ask the people still in the cabin whether or not anyone should be in the stand. Upon receiving a response in the negative, he approached Vang and told him to leave the property. Vang then apologized and started moving south towards a trail through a forested area of the property. According to Terry Willer's testimony, [...] "As Bob got back on the radio and asked me where he was at and I said, uh, he's heading south down on the food plot right now. I radioed in to the cabin that I had a tree-rat and I had chased him off." [...] At that point five of the hunters from the cabin who had heard the radio message arrived at the <b>tree</b> <b>stand.</b> Lauren Hesebeck a surviving victim stated, [...] "Bob had said I'm going to go talk to him to find out who he is, why he's there, and make sure he doesn't, you know, knows that he's on private property and that he's not welcomed there. Denny had said to me this ought to be interesting, let's go and see what's going on. We got in the back of it standing up (ATV), hanging on the rear bar."After following the directions given by Willers, they proceeded to approach Vang further down the trail. Crotteau then suggested making a note of his hunting license number to make a report to the DNR and, according to Hesebeck's testimony, Crotteau [...] "flipped over the hunting tag on Vang's back to get his license number".|$|E
6000|$|No, I {{have not}} the Edinburgh edition. If {{you think of}} a presentation--but I should be the last to suggest it. Perhaps on the whole I would prefer to have him in {{scattered}} books, rather than in a complete set. The half is more than the whole of most authors, and not the least of him. I am sure that his friends who reverenced his memory had good warrant and express instructions to publish this complete edition--very possibly it was arranged before his lamented end. Yet, speaking generally, I would say that an author was best served by being very carefully pruned before being exposed to the winds of time. Let every weak twig, every immature shoot be shorn away, and nothing but strong, sturdy, well-seasoned branches left. So shall the whole <b>tree</b> <b>stand</b> strong for years to come. How false an impression of the true Stevenson would our critical grandchild acquire if he chanced to pick down any one of half a dozen of these volumes! As we watched his hand stray down the rank, how we would pray that it might alight upon the ones we love, on the [...] "New Arabian Nights" [...] "The Ebb-tide," [...] "The Wrecker," [...] "Kidnapped," [...] or [...] "Treasure Island." [...] These can surely never lose their charm.|$|E

50|$|Not all Christmas tree stands are {{manufactured}} {{for the specific}} purpose, one example would be a makeshift Christmas <b>tree</b> <b>stand</b> made from an old two-gallon bucket or can. Another example of a homemade-type Christmas <b>tree</b> <b>stand</b> is a converted cast iron garden urn.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tree</b> <b>stand</b> users {{should always}} check over their stands to ensure good working {{condition}}. A <b>tree</b> <b>stand</b> in poor condition can be unsafe for the hunter to hunt from. Checking the {{steps up to}} the stand for safely and stability can prevent falling while climbing up to the stand.|$|E
50|$|Some Christmas tree stands were uniquely {{designed}} and have {{value in the}} secondary antiques market. One example is a 1950s decorative Christmas <b>tree</b> <b>stand</b> designed by National Outfit Manufacturers Association and made of lithographed tin and featuring a holiday design. A Christmas <b>tree</b> <b>stand</b> such of the lithographed tin design could fetch up to $250 on the open market.|$|E

50|$|Also, {{one of the}} mainstays of stalker {{vision is}} that the victim is watched {{over a period of}} time. Often Telescopes, binoculars, or other {{observation}} equipment are combined with a <b>tree</b> <b>stand</b> or some other place of watching.|$|E

The Peace <b>Tree</b> <b>Stand,</b> created in celebration of Peace Tree Day, featured drinks and treats {{from around the world}} along with workshops reflecting diversity and peace. Drinks included Sharbat Alabalou from Iran and Mugi cha from Japan, Jeera Pani from India, and sweet treats from different parts of Asia. The workshops featured children drawing mehndi peace symbols, making origami paper cranes, drumming workshops and sharing books about peace. The little toddlers tried their hand at creating new rhythms on the tabla and African drums blending beats and creating new rhythms.|$|E

50|$|As {{its name}} states, the game mostly {{revolves}} around hunting down and killing {{different species of}} deer in large, mountainous environments.There {{are several ways to}} hunt down the deer, including using a <b>tree</b> <b>stand</b> and waiting for them, tracking it down by examining its footprints, and by using callers and feeders to lure them to the player.|$|E

50|$|Tree stands or deer stands {{are open}} or {{enclosed}} platforms used by hunters. The platforms are secured to trees {{in order to}} elevate the hunter and give him or her a better vantage point. A tripod stand is a similar device, {{but because it is}} freestanding rather than attached to a tree, it is not technically a <b>tree</b> <b>stand.</b>|$|E
50|$|Before {{climbing}} the tree both parts {{need to be}} adjusted to the tree so that both upper and lower parts are angled up {{to account for the}} narrowing of the tree. To climb the tree the back of each part is angled to the tree one at a time and pulled up. Then the part that the hunter is moving is set back level and the next part is moved up. This is done until the hunter is at the desired height. In addition to the <b>tree</b> <b>stand,</b> some hunters use a safety harness to prevent injury in the event that any component of the <b>tree</b> <b>stand</b> fails. You should always be connected to the tree for safety. To descend the tree, the hunter simply reverses the order of operations to climb the tree - lowering the standing platform, standing on the standing platform, then lowering the sitting platform.|$|E
50|$|Goaltimate {{can also}} be played indoors. One setup used {{successfully}} was to put high-friction mats on a gym floor. On top of that were placed heavy cast iron Christmas tree stands. In the stands was fastened vertically 3.5 feet of 1.25 PVC, into which the normal hoop slid. In {{order to keep the}} hoop stationary, a bag of rocksalt was placed on each <b>tree</b> <b>stand.</b>|$|E
