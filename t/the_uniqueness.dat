5|$|If {{dropping}} {{the requirement for}} <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> of the solution, 41-clue minimal pseudo-puzzles are known to exist, {{but they can be}} completed to more than one solution grid. Removal of any clue increases the number of the completions and from this perspective none of the 41 clues is redundant. With slightly more than half the grid filled with givens (41 of 81 cells), <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> of the solution constraint still dominates over the minimality constraint.|$|E
5|$|Two {{important}} {{consequences of}} the group axioms are <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> of the identity element and <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> of inverse elements. There can be only one identity element in a group, and each element in a group has exactly one inverse element. Thus, it is customary {{to speak of the}} identity, and the inverse of an element.|$|E
5|$|Kriegseisen also {{remarks that}} there is a myth about <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> of sejmiks to Poland, and notes that similar {{institutions}} of self-governance and regional parliamentary participation by nobility can be found in other places, such as in Hungary and various German provinces (Silesia, Prussia, Brandenburg).|$|E

30|$|To further {{ascertain}} whether the model without the method effect {{due to the}} negatively corrected items was poorly specified, composite reliabilities with <b>the</b> correlated <b>uniquenesses</b> (see Additional file 4 : Table S 4) and without <b>the</b> correlated <b>uniquenesses</b> (not reported) were compared. The {{results showed that the}} reliability seems to be high initially as is the case for α, but once the model was properly specified its poor reliability became evident (the ω estimates). Without accounting for <b>the</b> correlated <b>uniquenesses,</b> <b>the</b> common factors would have to “pick up the slack” and the reliability was larger than it really was (K. J. Preacher, personal communication, February 18, 2014).|$|R
5|$|Motion, {{the process}} of movement, is {{described}} using specific anatomical terms. Motion includes movement of organs, joints, limbs, and specific sections of the body. The terminology used describes this motion according to its direction relative to the anatomical position of the joints. Anatomists use a unified set of terms to describe most of the movements, although other, more specialized terms are necessary for describing <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> of the movements {{such as those of}} the hands, feet, and eyes.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrangement}} of genitalia {{is important in}} courtship and mating as they prevent cross-specific mating and hybridisation. <b>The</b> <b>uniqueness</b> of a species' genitalia led {{to the use of}} the morphological study of genitalia as one of the most important keys in taxonomic identification of taxa below family level. With the advent of DNA analysis, the study of genitalia has now become just one of the techniques used in taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} this power is {{a high level of}} {{organizational}} and policy standardization among the different local jurisdictions allowing them to preserve <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> of their prefecture, city, or town.

5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, the school's population, {{academic}} program, and building {{were all in}} decline, in part reflecting the economic problems {{of the city as}} a whole. In 1977, the city school system allocated money to refurbish the school and bolster the college preparatory program. That same year the school system announced its intent to make City College coeducational; however, the all-male tradition did not end easily. Alumni argued for <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> of a single-sex education system, and a task force studying the issue voted 11–6 in favor of keeping the all-male tradition. In a stunning reversal, the board of school commissioners voted to admit women citing constitutional concerns over equal rights. The following year City College enrolled women for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Cantor's {{theory of}} transfinite numbers was {{originally}} regarded as so counter-intuitive – even shocking – that it encountered resistance from mathematical contemporaries such as Leopold Kronecker and Henri Poincaré and later from Hermann Weyl and L. E. J. Brouwer, while Ludwig Wittgenstein raised philosophical objections. Cantor, a devout Lutheran, believed the theory had been communicated {{to him by}} God. Some Christian theologians (particularly neo-Scholastics) saw Cantor's work {{as a challenge to}} <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> of the absolute infinity in the nature of God – on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism – a proposition that Cantor vigorously rejected.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Keeper {{took over}} two years to develop, and an {{expansion}} pack, a Direct3D version, and a level editor were released. Midway through development, Molyneux decided to leave Bullfrog when the game was complete, which was the motivation for its success. Versions for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation were in development, but cancelled. The game received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> and depth. Dungeon Keeper was re-released on gog.com in 2011, and on Origin in 2016. A fan-made mod, KeeperFX, was released, which fixes bugs and adds features. Dungeon Keeper {{was followed by a}} sequel, Dungeon Keeper 2, in 1999, and influenced games such as Lego Rock Raiders and Ghost Master.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, a 50% {{complete}} {{skeleton of}} a juvenile Tyrannosaurus was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, by a crew from the Burpee Museum of Natural History of Rockford, Illinois. Dubbed Jane, the find was initially considered the first known skeleton of the pygmy tyrannosaurid Nanotyrannus but subsequent research has revealed {{that it is more}} likely a juvenile Tyrannosaurus. It is the most complete and best preserved juvenile example known to date. Jane has been examined by Jack Horner, Pete Larson, Robert Bakker, Greg Erickson, and several other renowned paleontologists, because of <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> of her age.

5|$|Large-scale {{limestone}} quarrying {{has been}} a particular area of contention.

The Peak District National Park Authority has a policy of considering all new quarrying and licence renewal applications within {{the area of the}} National Park in terms of the local and national need for the mineral and <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> of the source, in conjunction with the effects on traffic, local residents and the environment.|$|E
5|$|Like the game, {{the comic}} {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world, overrun by zombie-like creatures {{infected}} by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. The comics serve as a prequel to the game, chronicling the journey of the young Ellie and her meeting with another young survivor, Riley Abel. Druckmann chose Ellie as the focus of the comic due to <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> of her birth and upbringing in the post-apocalyptic world. Hicks joined the project after discovering Ellie's role in the game, considering her an unusual character to include in a survival horror game. The comic's art style is different than the game art—a choice from Hicks to give the comic a unique feel and identity.|$|E

5|$|Stela 16 {{celebrates the}} {{accession}} {{of a local}} sajal, or Maya leader, at the nearby satellite kingdom of La Mar. Tatiana Proskouriakoff had originally used this stela to misidentify the sixth ajaw of Piedras Negras, assigning the title to the sajal, instead of Ha' K'in Xook. <b>The</b> <b>uniqueness</b> of a La Mar ruler being celebrated on a Piedras Negras stela seems to signify that La Mar had, {{at the time of}} Yo'nal Ahk III and possibly earlier, attained a certain degree of importance in the Piedras Negras hegemony. The front of the stela is eroded, but according to Megan O'Neil, it can be inferred that the monument had an image of Yo'nal Ahk III on the front, based on comparisons with other stelae at Piedras Negras, like Stelae 6 and 11.|$|E
5|$|The Renaissance in Scotland was a cultural, {{intellectual}} and artistic movement in Scotland, {{from the late}} fifteenth century {{to the beginning of}} the seventeenth century. It is associated with the pan-European Renaissance that is usually regarded as beginning in Italy in the late fourteenth century and reaching northern Europe as a Northern Renaissance in the fifteenth century. It involved an attempt to revive the principles of the classical era, including humanism, a spirit of scholarly enquiry, scepticism, and concepts of balance and proportion. Since the twentieth century <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> and unity of the Renaissance has been challenged by historians, but significant changes in Scotland can be seen to have taken place in education, intellectual life, literature, art, architecture, music and politics.|$|E
5|$|The {{beautiful}} nuthatch {{was first}} described in 1843 by British zoologist Edward Blyth, from a specimen he examined in Darjeeling. Its kinship {{with other members}} of the genus is unclear. The bright blue color of its plumage invites a comparison to the blue nuthatch (S. azurea), or other blue-tinted nuthatch species such as the velvet-fronted nuthatch (S. frontalis), yellow-billed nuthatch (S. solangiae) and the sulphur-billed nuthatch (S. oenochlamys), but its distribution being focused in the eastern Himalayas, and <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> of its plumage, argues against the assumption.

By understanding the nature of time and the order of the universe, mankind is able to recognise God and seek redemption. Many reviewers of Burnt Norton focused on <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> and beauty of the poem.

5|$|The {{fortress}} contained barracks, granaries, headquarters, military baths, and {{an unusual}} elliptical building which {{had it been}} finished may have been intended to act as the governor of Britain's headquarters. Several factors including <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> of the elliptical building, the method of construction, and the unusual size of the fortress– 20% larger than other Roman fortresses in Britain– suggest {{that it may have}} been intended as the base for a potential invasion of Ireland, and perhaps eventually to become the capital of the unified British Isles under Rome.|$|E
5|$|In a 1976 referendum, New Jersey voters {{approved}} casino gambling in Atlantic City. Because {{of concerns about}} organized crime connections to gambling, New Jersey enacted strict regulations that included licensing of all casino employees and contractors, and a separation of powers between the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) and the Casino Control Commission (CCC). The Division of Gaming Enforcement {{is part of the}} New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety, and is responsible for investigating casino license applications, monitoring casino operations, and enforcing New Jersey's casino laws and regulations as defined in Title 5, Chapter 12 of New Jersey's statutes, and Title 13, Chapter 69I of New Jersey's Administrative Code. The Casino Control Commission is an independent agency in the state Treasury Department with both quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers, and is responsible for creating casino regulations, hearing appeals of DGE penalties, and make decisions on casino licensing. In light of such regulation and <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> of casino gambling, New Jersey's twelve casinos are not {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) or Atlantic City's alcoholic beverage control board.|$|E
