30|$|Different {{configurations}} {{are possible}} for a binaural beamforming system, for instance, both <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> could transmit their received microphone signals to a central device where the beamforming is performed, and the result could then be transmitted back to <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aids.</b> Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> could exchange their signals and beamforming may be performed on each <b>hearing</b> <b>aid.</b> In this paper, to analyze the effect of quantization errors on beamforming, {{without loss of generality}} we assume that each <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> has one microphone and that <b>the</b> right <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> quantizes and transmits its signal to <b>the</b> left <b>hearing</b> <b>aid,</b> where <b>the</b> two signals are combined using a beamformer.

40|$|In this work, we {{construct}} a novel scheme for efficient perceptual coding of audio for robust communication between encoders and wireless <b>hearing</b> <b>aids.</b> To limit <b>the</b> physical size of <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> {{and to reduce}} power consumption and thereby increase the lifetime expectancy of <b>the</b> batteries, <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> are constrained to be of low complexity. We therefore provide an asymmetric strategy {{where most of the}} computational load is placed at the encoding side. We make use of multiple-description coding. This combats possible erasures on the wireless link between the encoder and <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> without introducing significant delay. Furthermore, we employ psychoacoustically optimized noise-shaping quantizers based on the moving-horizon principle, which exploits a finite prediction horizon...|$|R

25|$|The type of battery a {{specific}} hearing aid utilizes {{depends on the}} physical size allowable and the desired lifetime of the battery, which is in turn determined by the power draw of <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> device. Typical battery lifetimes run between 1 and 14 days (assuming 16-hour days).|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> of {{this type}} was {{developed}} by Etymonic Design. A little later, Mangold and Lane created a programmable multi-channel hearing aid.

25|$|The first {{electrical}} {{hearing aid}} used the carbon microphone {{of the telephone}} and was introduced in 1896. The vacuum tube made electronic amplification possible, but early versions of amplified hearing aids were too heavy to carry around. Miniaturization of vacuum tubes lead to portable models, and after World War II, wearable models using miniature tubes. The transistor invented in 1948 was well suited to <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> application due to low power and small size; hearing aids were an early adopter of transistors. The development of integrated circuits allowed further improvement of the capabilities of wearable aids, including implementation of digital signal processing techniques and programmability for the individual user's needs.|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} {{theme of}} the book is the North-South relationship as it influences the extent of federalism in the United States. [...] The book describes how from before the Civil War to well after the Civil Rights Movement the balance of power between protectors of state's rights and defenders of the federal government have battled over resources and power along North-South alliances. [...] Jackson is a detractor of state's rights and feels that the extensive power given to states has slowed our broad distribution of social goods by perpetuating inequality and thus unrest. [...] Dyson also notes that Jackson attempts to bring class to the forefront of the discourse in an effort to offer a political vision toward social equity and equality. [...] He says Jackson views race as the lens to optimally view American history and views economic issues as <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> through which the politics of today can best be heard.|$|E
2500|$|The {{electromagnetic}} (telecoil) mode {{is usually}} {{more effective than}} the acoustic method. This is mainly because the microphone is often automatically switched off when <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> is operating in telecoil mode, so background noise is not amplified. Since there is an electronic connection to the phone, the sound is clearer and distortion is less likely. But in order for this to work, the phone has to be hearing-aid compatible. More technically, the phone's speaker has to have a voice coil that generates a relatively strong electromagnetic field. Speakers with strong voice coils are more expensive and require more energy than the tiny ones used in many modern telephones; phones with the small low-power speakers cannot couple electromagnetically with the telecoil in <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aid,</b> so <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> must then switch to acoustic mode. [...] Also, many mobile phones emit high levels of electromagnetic noise that creates audible static in <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> when the telecoil is used. [...] A workaround that resolves this issue on many mobile phones is to plug a wired (not Bluetooth) headset into the mobile phone; with the headset placed near <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> the phone can be held far enough away to attenuate the static. [...] Another method is to use a [...] "neckloop" [...] (which is like a portable, around-the-neck induction loop), and plug the neckloop directly into the standard audio jack (headphones jack) of a smartphone (or laptop, or stereo, etc.). Then, with the hearing aids' telecoil turned on (usually a button to press), the sound will travel directly from the phone, through the neckloop and into the hearing aids' telecoils.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present pilot study is {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of three conventional contralateral routing of sound (CROS) <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> in adults with unilateral inner ear deafness. The study included tertiary referral center. Ten patients with unilateral inner ear deafness and normal <b>hearing</b> in <b>the</b> contralateral ear were selected to evaluate three different methods of amplification: <b>the</b> CROS <b>hearing</b> <b>aid,</b> <b>the</b> completely in <b>the</b> canal <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> and <b>the</b> bone-anchored <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> CROS (BAHA). Each of <b>the</b> three <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> was tried in a random order for a period of 8 Â weeks. Audiometric performance, including speech-in-noise, directional hearing and subjective benefit were measured after each trial period, using the APHAB, SSQ and single-sided deafness questionnaire. Sound localization performance was essentially at chance level in all four conditions. Mixed results were seen on the other patient outcome measures that alternated in favor of one of the three CROS devices. After the trial, three patients chose to be fitted with the BAHA CROS and one with the conventional CROS. In conclusion, most of the patients experienced some degree of benefit with each of <b>the</b> three <b>hearing</b> <b>aids.</b> Preference for one of <b>the</b> three <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> was independent of the order in which they were tried. It would be worthwhile to formulate selection criteria; still, we recommend that all patients with unilateral inner ear deafness should be offered a trial with at least the BAHA CROS...|$|R
40|$|Clinical audiologists at Utah State University {{have been}} using a master <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> as a basic part of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> {{evaluation}} procedures. To ascertain the usefulness of <b>the</b> master <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> in predicting patient success with a wearable <b>hearing</b> <b>aid,</b> 20 subjects were given speech audiometric tests under the following conditions: (l) without amplification; (2) with the headset system of <b>the</b> master <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> (a system which utilizes chassis mounted microphones and external receivers of the type used with body-worn hearing aids); (3) with the ear-level system of <b>the</b> master <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> (a system which utilizes a microphone and receiver mounted in an ear-level <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> case); and (4) with a wearable ear-level <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> which had been previously selected for each subject {{on the basis of}} master <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> data. Using <b>the</b> ANOV procedure, statistically significant differences Î±=. 05) were found between the mean speech reception thresholds obtained under the three aided test conditions, but differences were not clinically significant. The mean speech reception thresholds a greed within 4. 0 dB. No significant difference was found between the mean speech discrimination scores obtained in quiet under the three aided test conditions.

2500|$|Adaptive {{directional}} microphones automatically {{vary the}} direction of maximum amplification or rejection (to reduce an interfering directional sound source).

The presence of multiple speech signals makes it difficult for the processor to correctly select the desired speech signal.

30|$|A {{high-speed}} wireless {{link between}} <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> worn on <b>the</b> {{left and right}} ears has been recently introduced [3]. This allows binaural beamforming without the necessity of having a wired connection between <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aids,</b> which is impractical again due to aesthetic reasons. <b>The</b> two <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> form a body area network, and can provide significant performance gains by collaborating with one another. The performance of binaural noise reduction systems has been previously studied in, for example, [4 â€“ 8]. However these systems implicitly assume {{the availability of the}} error-free left and right microphone signals for processing. In practice, the amount of information that can be shared between the left and right <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> is limited by constraints on power consumption imposed by the limited capacity of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> batteries. It is known [9] that quantization of a signal with an additional bit causes the power dissipation in an ADC to be increased by 3 [*]dB.
