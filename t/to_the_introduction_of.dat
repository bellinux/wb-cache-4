5|$|During the Middle Ages, clocks {{primarily}} served religious purposes; {{the first}} employed for secular timekeeping emerged around the 15th century. In Dublin, the official measurement of time became a local custom, and by 1466 a public clock stood {{on top of}} the Tholsel (the city court and council chamber). It was {{the first of its kind}} to be clearly recorded in Ireland, and would only have had an hour hand. The increasing lavishness of castles led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> turret clocks. A 1435 example survives from Leeds castle; its face is decorated with the images of the Crucifixion of Jesus, Mary and St George.|$|E
