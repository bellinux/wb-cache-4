Despite the appearance that these events seem random, they do overall follow a fairly steady cycle of approximately 11 years. The difference in average solar irradiation {{received by the}} earth due to these ‘random’ events, though, is only about 0.1 percent.

40|$|The {{calculation}} of the total solar energy received during a given interval of time over the year requires more attention than the {{calculation of}} the daily incoming solar radiation (daily insolation). It depends indeed upon whether the time interval is {{defined in terms of}} the true longitude or of the calendar date. The details of such a calculation based on elliptic integrals and on the sum of the daily irradiations are given in this paper. Numerical examples show the very high accuracy of both methods. The analytical expression and the spectral analysis of the long-term variations of such irradiation received during any time interval over the year show that they depend almost exclusively upon obliquity with a very small contribution of eccentricity, not at all upon precession. The eccentricity signal comes from the variation of the so-called solar constant through the variation of the mean distance from the Earth to the Sun. The precession signal is eliminated through the second law by Kepler. The correlation between <b>total</b> <b>irradiation</b> and obliquity reverses its sign at a specific latitude of the summer hemisphere which {{is a function of the}} selected time interval. At this latitude the obliquity signal disappears and only a pure eccentricity signal is left in the <b>total</b> <b>irradiation,</b> but with a very weak amplitude. Amplitude of the continuous wavelet transforrm shows that the amplitude variation of both the daily irradiance (mostly precession) and of the <b>total</b> <b>irradiation</b> (obliquity) vanishes around the Mid-Pleistocene Transition.

In order to have maximum irradiation converted into electricity, both the tilt angle and orientation of the PV surface should be optimum. It is found that the <b>total</b> <b>irradiation</b> captured on a tilted surface mounted in Ipoh, Malaysia can be maximized by positioning the PV modules at the monthly optimum tilt of β optimum = φ-δ, facing North (γ = 180 °) for the months April to August and facing South (γ = 0 °) {{for the rest of the}} months throughout the year. The <b>total</b> <b>irradiation</b> on a tilted surface calculated in this study considered the beam, diffuse and reflected components of the radiation on a tilted surface. The <b>total</b> <b>irradiation</b> incident on surfaces tilted at β = φ, β = 0 ° and β = |φ-δ| were also investigated. A gain of 6. 4 and 6. 1 %, respectively is achieved by positioning the PV modules at the monthly optimum tilt and orientation as compared to keeping them fixed throughout the year at horizontal (β = 0 °) or at latitude (β = φ). PV modules maintained at a monthly tilt of β = |φ-δ| with South facing orientation at all times accounted for a loss of approximately 5. 3 % in total tilted irradiation as compared to tilting the PV modules to β optimum with North and South facing surfaces. This indicates that the orientations of PV modules are equally as important as tilt angles...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe use of multileaf collimators (MLCs) is {{a modern}} way to realize {{intensity}} modulated fields in radiotherapy. An important step in the treatment planning is the shape matrix decomposition: the desired fluence distribution, given by an integer matrix, has to be decomposed into a small number shape matrices, i. e. (0, 1) -matrices corresponding to the field shapes that can be delivered by the MLC used. The two main objectives are to minimize the <b>total</b> <b>irradiation</b> time, {{and the number of}} shape matrices. Assuming that the entries of the fluence matrix are bounded by a constant, we prove that a shape matrix decomposition with minimal number of shape matrices under the condition that the <b>total</b> <b>irradiation</b> time is minimal, can be determined in time polynomial in the matrix dimensions. The results of our algorithm are compared with Engel’s [K. Engel, A new algorithm for optimal multileaf collimator field segmentation, Discrete Appl.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer {{survivors}} may develop {{a number of}} endocrine complications linked to organ failure, such as hypogonadism, diabetes and growth hormone deficiency. However, increasing evidence now suggests that <b>total</b> body <b>irradiation</b> treatment, specifically, is linked with future risk of insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and dyslipidaemia, possibly because <b>total</b> body <b>irradiation</b> affects adipocyte differentiation and impairs subcutaneous adipose tissue depot expansion during times of positive energy balance. CASE REPORT: We describe a 20 -year-old woman who developed pancreatitis with severe hypertriglyceridaemia (serum triglycerides > 300 mmol/l) that required plasmapheresis. She had received <b>total</b> body <b>irradiation</b> prior to her bone marrow transplant at age 6 years for relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. She developed ovarian failure at age 12 years. At age 15 years she was noted to have hyperglycaemia, increased blood pressure, hepatic steatosis and mild hypertriglyceridaemia. She presented with severe hypertriglyceridaemia and eruptive xanthoma, and developed pancreatitis 12 h after admission. She was treated with plasmapheresis and intravenous insulin and made an excellent recovery.

The variation of the daily erythemal irradiation was found to be ¤ 24 per cent (¤ 1 sigma) for the period of the campaign. The variation of the total ozone column contributes less than ¤ 3 per cent to this variability; the main part is introduced by clouds.
