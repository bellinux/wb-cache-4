5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, dance-oriented disco music was {{very popular in}} the United States, {{particularly}} after being featured in hit films such as Saturday Night Fever (1977). Despite its popularity, disco sparked a backlash from rock music fans. This opposition was prominent enough that the White Sox, seeking to fill seats at Comiskey Park during a lackluster season, engaged Chicago shock jock and anti-disco campaigner Steve Dahl for the promotion at the July12 doubleheader, <b>the</b> <b>Thursday</b> preceding the All-Star break. Dahl's sponsoring radio station was 97.9 WLUP-FM, so attendees would pay 98 cents and bring a disco record; between games, Dahl would destroy the collected vinyl in an explosion.|$|E

Glyn Pardoe missed {{training}} on Monday 21st with a leg injury, but after the fitness of Pardoe, Tony Coleman and Alan Oakes was tested in a practice match, all three were passed fit. Leicester City named a 14-man squad before travelling to a training camp in Bisham on the Tuesday. Manchester City travelled south on <b>the</b> <b>Thursday,</b> staying in Weybridge. Leicester had fitness doubts over Dave Gibson, Len Glover and John Sjoberg, but initially expected all three to be available for the final. However, in a practice match against Brentford, Sjoberg {{had to leave the}} field with a groin injury. His place in the team was taken by Alan Woollett.|$|E
5|$|Murray had {{to recover}} from a virus {{to play in the}} Quarter Final tie against Italy in Naples after missing <b>the</b> <b>Thursday</b> draw ceremony.

On Saturday morning, Murray {{finished}} his match, winning in three sets. Two hours later, Murray partnered Colin Fleming to win the doubles rubber. Murray had only beaten one top ten player on clay, Nikolay Davydenko, back in 2009, and was upset by Fabio Fognini, world No. 13, in straight sets, which took Great Britain to the deciding final rubber.

5|$|Somerset's quarter-final, against Lancashire, was {{scheduled}} for Tuesday 28 July 2009. Bad weather meant that no play was possible on either the Tuesday or Wednesday, {{as a result of}} which the teams requested special dispensation from the ECB for an additional reserve day on <b>the</b> <b>Thursday,</b> which was granted. The wet weather continued, forcing the teams to play a bowl-out. Each team had to select five bowlers, each of whom had two deliveries at a set of unguarded stumps. Somerset won the bowl-out 5–1, with Ben Phillips, Peter Trego and Willoughby each hitting the stumps once, and Thomas hitting them twice.|$|E

5|$|The Games {{took place}} on <b>the</b> <b>Thursday</b> and Friday of the week of Whitsun, {{normally}} between mid-May and mid-June. Many 17th-century Puritans disapproved of such festivities, believing them to be of pagan origin, and they particularly disapproved of any celebration on a Sunday or a church holiday such as Whitsun. By the time of King James's death in 1625, many Puritan landowners had forbidden their workers to attend such festivities; the increasing tensions between the supporters of the king and the Puritans resulted in {{the outbreak of the}} English Civil War in 1642, bringing the Games to an end.|$|E

The site's data go back to 1982, and in every year the winter season has had the lowest box office grosses.

5|$|The welcome {{extended}} by the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) was {{in contrast to}} that of Scotland.

5|$|After year-long {{expectations}} that the ninth season {{would be the}} series' last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series' creative team {{did not want to}} extend negotiations into the next year, and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale. NBC agreed to pay $10million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series. Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to <b>the</b> <b>Thursday</b> night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series. The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.|$|E
5|$|Big Brother 11 was {{broadcast}} on CBS from July 9, 2009 to September 15, 2009. This season lasted {{a total of}} 73 days, making it the third shortest season of the series to date. This season featured no changes to the schedule {{that was used in}} the previous edition, with episodes airing on Tuesdays, Thursday, and Sunday each week. <b>The</b> <b>Thursday</b> episode, which aired at 9 PM Eastern time, featured the live eviction and subsequent Head of Household competition taking place. During the live eviction, the show was hosted by Julie Chen. The Sunday episode, which aired at 8 PM Eastern time, featured the food competition and nomination ceremony, as well as some highlights from the previous days. The Tuesday episode featured the Power of Veto competition and the Power of Veto ceremony, along with more highlights of recent events in the game. Some changes to the scheduling format were made. Chima's expulsion from the game, for example, led to various changes in the formatting of the television broadcasts, and led to the cancellation of the upcoming Double Eviction week. The series {{was broadcast}} on Global Television Network in Canada. For {{the first time in the}} history of the show, Big Brother had a two-hour live season finale, which aired on September 15, an increase from the usual hour.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham {{also had}} doubts over their selection. Captain Len Boyd had {{for some time}} been {{suffering}} from a debilitating back problem, and relied on injections to keep him playing. He missed five of the last seven games of the season, but was passed fit on the Wednesday before the game. Fellow wing half Roy Warhurst had injured his thigh in the sixth-round match and played no further part in the season, while Badham, who damaged an ankle {{three weeks before the}} final, travelled on <b>the</b> <b>Thursday</b> {{with the rest of the}} team to their base in Twyford, Berkshire. Jeff Hall was struggling with a virus. When manager Turner announced his team on the eve of the match, Boyd took Warhurst's position at left-half, Badham, who had proved an able deputy in the semi-final, was omitted, and the inexperienced 22-year-old Johnny Newman came in on the right.|$|E
