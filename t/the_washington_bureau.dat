500|$|Clinton's {{choice was}} criticized as {{unconventional}} because rather than picking {{a running mate}} who would diversify the ticket, Clinton chose a fellow Southerner who shared his political ideologies and who was nearly {{the same age as}} Clinton. <b>The</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Bureau</b> Chief for The Baltimore Sun, Paul West, later suggested that, [...] "Al Gore revolutionized the way Vice Presidents are made. When he joined Bill Clinton's ticket, it violated the old rules. Regional diversity? Not with two Southerners from neighboring states. Ideological balance? A couple of left-of-center moderates. [...] And yet, Gore has come to be regarded by strategists in both parties as the best vice presidential pick in at least 20 years." ...|$|E

6000|$|The British {{authorities}} which I {{have mentioned}} are {{reinforced by the}} example of many foreign countries; and as early as 1904 the Board of Trade, in its reports on agencies and methods of dealing with unemployed in foreign countries, {{drew attention to the}} very considerable extension of Labour Exchanges {{in the last three years}} in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, and Belgium. Since then Norway has been added to the list. Mr. W. Bliss, in the Bulletin of <b>the</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Bureau</b> of Labour for May, 1908, in the course of a survey of the whole field of unemployment and of possible remedies, says, [...] "The most important agencies for providing work for the unemployed who are employable, but have no prospect of returning to their former positions, are the public employment bureaux. These are largely developed in a number of European countries, and especially in Germany, where they have grown rapidly in the last twenty years, both in numbers and in efficiency." [...] So that the House will see that we have behind us this afternoon not only a practical consensus of opinion among authorities at home in favour of the policy, but the spectacle of its successful practice on an extensive scale, and over a period of years, in the greatest industrial community of the Continent, and its extension in various degrees to many other countries.|$|E
