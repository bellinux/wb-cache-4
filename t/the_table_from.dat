5|$|Atomic radii vary in a {{predictable}} and explainable manner across the periodic table. For instance, the radii generally decrease along each period of <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>from</b> the alkali metals to the noble gases; and increase down each group. The radius increases sharply between the noble gas {{at the end}} of each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period. These trends of the atomic radii (and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements) can be explained by the electron shell theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of quantum theory.|$|E

5|$|Earlier in {{the year}} manager George Graham had started to {{assemble}} a squad with a blend of youth and experience. Having already signed defenders Steve Bould and Lee Dixon, he set about trimming the squad letting Steve Williams and Kenny Sansom leave. Arsenal were not considered favourites for the league title {{at the start of}} the season, but a 5–1 win away at Wimbledon on the opening day led to talk over their chances. They continued their fine start to the campaign, particularly away from home and led <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>from</b> the Christmas period. At one stage Arsenal were 11 points clear of Liverpool, but a series of draws and surprising defeats allowed the gap to be closed. By the time Arsenal faced Liverpool on the final day, they were faced with an improbable challenge – winning by a two-goal margin against the defending champions to claim the title. Graham's cautious approach paid dividends as Arsenal led after the break, and deep into stoppage time midfielder Michael Thomas scored the all-important second goal.|$|E
5|$|In 1997–98, Mills' Grantham won the Southern League Midland Division title, earning {{promotion}} to the Southern League Premier Division, having led <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>from</b> {{the start of}} the season. Grantham also reached the quarter-final of the FA Trophy {{for only the second time}} in the club's history. He appeared even more frequently in the first team this season, making 50 appearances. However, Mills resigned a week after the season ended in May 1998 as the club's takeover by local businessman Reg Brealey would have meant dismantling the team due to budget cuts. He joined Gresley Rovers of the Southern League Premier Division as a player in July 1998, making his debut in their 0–0 away draw with Bromsgrove Rovers on 22 August. He appeared regularly for Gresley, playing in their first seven matches of 1998–99.|$|E
5|$|Whittaker enjoyed {{immediate}} success, {{winning the}} League title in 1947–48; led by captain Joe Mercer's strong defence and with goals from attacking front two of Reg Lewis and Ronnie Rooke, Arsenal were top of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>from</b> October until the season's climax, winning by a seven-point margin. However, given {{the age of}} the Arsenal side at the time (Rooke and Mercer were both over thirty, as were Denis and Leslie Compton), long-term success was not possible. In response, Whittaker had brought in younger players such as Doug Lishman, Alex Forbes and Cliff Holton. Although Arsenal were unable to sustain any challenges for the League title, with the new blood they won the FA Cup in 1949–50, with Reg Lewis scoring both goals in a 2–0 win over Liverpool.|$|E

By December 2012 it was clear that Rovers were in perhaps the biggest danger of dropping out of the Football League they had ever been, which resulted in McGhee being sacked and former manager John Ward returning to the club. The club's form greatly improved in the weeks that followed, and another safe finish was achieved, this time 14th.|$|E
25|$|Inter {{started the}} 2007–08 {{season with the}} goal of winning both Serie A and Champions League. The team started well in the league, topping <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>from</b> the first round of matches, and also managed to qualify for the Champions League {{knockout}} stage. However, a late collapse, leading to a 2–0 defeat with ten men away to Liverpool on 19 February in the Champions League, threw into question manager Roberto Mancini's future at Inter while domestic form took a sharp turn of fortune with the team failing to win in the three following Serie A games. After being eliminated by Liverpool in the Champions League, Mancini announced his intention to leave his job immediately only to change his mind the following day. On {{the final day of the}} 2007–08 Serie A season, Inter played Parma away, and two goals from Zlatan Ibrahimović sealed their third consecutive championship. Mancini, however, was sacked soon after due to his previous announcement to leave the club.|$|E

[...] For [...] "Ecstasy", he commended her [...] "hard working ethic" [...] in many songs, highlighting the song and concluded that, [...] "All of this reveals a desperate need to achieve success no matter what, but also the humanity of the effort underpinning it." [...] Greenberg commended the production of [...] "Ecstasy", and said that [...] "Lick Me" [...] was [...] "slightly off-tempo" [...] that [...] "brings Kumi back to more standard territory." [...] A reviewer from CD Journal complimented the production of each song, and described the EP as [...] "catchy" [...] and [...] "danceable".

He was replaced by Graeme Souness but the change of manager was not enough to prevent the league title from slipping away from Anfield. Shortly after Dalglish's resignation, Liverpool were eliminated from the FA Cup in the fifth round by neighbours Everton, seeing their double hopes eliminated for the fourth season running (though this time at a much earlier stage). However, Liverpool finished second and were finally readmitted to European competition, qualifying for the UEFA Cup and giving Rush and his teammates their first chance of European action since 1984–85.|$|E

2500|$|Yakiniku (焼き肉 or 焼肉), meaning [...] "grilled meat", is a Japanese term that, in its {{broadest}} sense, {{refers to}} grilled meat cuisine. [...] "Yakiniku" [...] originally referred to western [...] "barbecue" [...] food, the term being popularized by Japanese writer Kanagaki Robun (仮名垣魯文) in his Seiyo Ryoritsu (i.e. [...] "western food handbook") in 1872 (Meiji period). Meat has been eaten in Japan since the Jōmon period. However, {{the rise of}} Buddhism made the eating of meat taboo and some people have theorized that meat [...] "disappeared" [...] from <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>from</b> the Middle Ages through to the Edo period. The term [...] "yakiniku" [...] became associated with Korean-derived cuisine during the early Showa period. Due to the Korean War, Korean restaurants in Japan were divided into North Korean (Kita Chōsen) and South Korean (Kankoku); the reference to a [...] "yakiniku restaurant" [...] arose as a politically correct term for restaurants of either origin.|$|E
2500|$|The February 2011 Christchurch {{earthquake}} (22 February 2011), a Richter magnitude 6.3 earthquake, caused {{considerable damage}} to the Cathedral. The Cathedral administrator, Monsignor Charles Drennan, said that engineers had indicated that it was unlikely the building could be saved. The two bell towers {{at the front of}} the building collapsed, bringing much of the front façade down with them, with large blocks of masonry destroying vehicles in front of the building. There was also major cracking evident around the Cathedral's main dome. Stained glass windows, which had survived the 4 September earthquake and some 4,000 aftershocks, were also [...] "in ruins". Monsignor Drennan said that workers repairing {{damage to the}} building caused by the earlier earthquake, escaped, as did a custodian who was in the Cathedral at the time. Drennan told Kim Hill in a National Radio interview on 5 March that the screams of the children at the nearby school when the earthquake struck at nine minutes to one [...] "will stay with him for a long time".

2500|$|Back in Pro D2 for the 2006–07 season, Toulon finish {{fourth in}} the league, putting them in the {{promotion}} playoffs for {{a place in the}} Top 14, but they lost in the promotion semi-finals 21–17 at La Rochelle. The following season Toulon headed <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>from</b> early on, never dropping from the top spot on their way to clinching promotion with two rounds to spare. The 2008–09 season proved to be one of consolidation. Umaga had been handed the coaching reins, but as Boudjellal would later say, [...] "The first season in the Top 14 was very difficult and I learned that Tana Umaga was not yet ready to give up playing – and that he's not a manager." [...] The team managed to survive that season, using a late-season surge to avoid a relegation scare. Toulon had a much more successful 2009–10 campaign, with Wilkinson leading the charge. He would be named the top fly-half of the year in France by leading rugby publication Midi Olympique, and would also be recalled to the England national team. Domestically, Toulon finished second on the league table, losing out to Perpignan for the top spot on a tiebreaker. This finish gave them a spot in the 2010–11 Heineken Cup, and also a first-round bye in that season's Top 14 playoffs. Toulon's domestic campaign ended in the semi-finals with a 35–29 extra-time loss to eventual champion Clermont in Saint-Étienne.|$|E
