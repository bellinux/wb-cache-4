5|$|After the earthquake, several {{websites}} speculated {{about whether}} hydraulic fracturing (fracking) {{for natural gas}} production could have caused or contributed to <b>the</b> <b>quake.</b> There were not any fracking operations in Virginia {{at the time of}} <b>the</b> <b>quake.</b> The nearest fracking was occurring in the Marcellus shale in West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Staff at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., {{reported}} {{that some of}} the animals in the park appeared to show behavior suggesting that they anticipated the earthquake from seconds to minutes before it was felt in the area. The earthquake was felt at the great ape exhibits during afternoon feeding time. About three to ten seconds before <b>the</b> <b>quake,</b> many of the apes abandoned their food and {{climbed to the top of}} a tree-like structure in the exhibit. The red ruffed lemurs sounded an alarm call about 15 minutes before <b>the</b> <b>quake,</b> and the flock of 64 flamingos rushed about and grouped themselves together just before <b>the</b> <b>quake.</b> During <b>the</b> <b>quake,</b> some animals vocalized, some ran or dove for cover, and some stood up and stared at the walls of their enclosures. Some of the animals remained agitated for the rest of the day, while others calmed quickly. The Zoo's giant pandas did not appear to respond to <b>the</b> <b>quake.</b>|$|E
5|$|In August and September, {{the first}} {{screenshots}} of Duke Nukem Forever were released in PC Gamer. However, 3D Realms {{did not receive}} <b>the</b> <b>Quake</b> II engine code until November 1997, and the earlier screenshots were mock-ups with <b>the</b> <b>Quake</b> engine that the team had made in their spare time. 3D Realms unveiled the first video footage of Duke Nukem Forever using <b>the</b> <b>Quake</b> II engine at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) conference. The trailer showed Duke fighting {{on the back of}} a moving truck and firefights with aliens. While critics were impressed, Broussard was not happy with the progress being made.|$|E
5000|$|In , Budde mainly {{played for}} <b>the</b> <b>Quakes,</b> but also played 5 {{games for the}} Triple-A Salt Lake Stingers. In 99 games with <b>the</b> <b>Quakes,</b> he batted [...]251 with 13 home runs.|$|R
50|$|On January 1, 1992, <b>the</b> <b>Quakes</b> {{released}} {{their second}} record, Voice of America by Robbie Takac of the Goo Goo Dolls. In {{the spring of}} 1991, <b>the</b> <b>Quakes</b> planned to appear at a large festival in Germany and go on tour, but Brian Doran was unable to go, resulting in Chris VanCleve returning to the band. In the next few months, <b>the</b> <b>Quakes</b> went on tour in Japan based on their strong record sales for an independent band. First, <b>the</b> <b>Quakes</b> recorded a live album from Tokyo with Planet Records, then were signed by the Japanese division of Sony Records with {{plans for a new}} album and a large Japanese tour.|$|R
25|$|The San Jose Earthquakes {{franchise}} was revived by Lewis Wolff and Earthquakes Soccer, LLC, restarting {{the rivalry}} in 2008. Ignominiously, both <b>the</b> <b>Quakes</b> and Galaxy {{tied for the}} worst record that season. <b>The</b> <b>Quakes</b> lost <b>the</b> series and thus received the dubious distinction.|$|R
5|$|In 1964, {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} ever {{recorded in the}} United States struck Anchorage and southern Alaska, cutting communications to the outside world. <b>The</b> <b>quake</b> was felt in Fairbanks, and it took 40 minutes for communications to be re-established with the Associated Press office in Seattle. When the connection was restored, the News-Miner sent the first reports of the earthquake to the outside world. <b>The</b> <b>quake</b> also destroyed {{the offices of the}} Anchorage Times, the leading newspaper in that city. The News-Miner offered its press facilities to the Times, and the two papers shared a masthead as Anchorage recovered from the tremor.|$|E
5|$|After {{acquiring}} {{the site in}} 1142, they began building a new castle to replace the former Kurdish fortification. This work lasted until 1170, when an earthquake damaged the castle. An Arab source mentions that <b>the</b> <b>quake</b> destroyed the castle's chapel, which {{was replaced by the}} present chapel. In 1163 the Crusaders emerged victorious over Nur ad-Din in the Battle of al-Buqaia near Krak des Chevaliers.|$|E
5|$|Buildings swayed {{with the}} tremor in Mexico City, {{prompting}} evacuations and causing panic among many. Following <b>the</b> <b>quake,</b> police patrolled city streets for safety reasons and damage assessments {{were carried out}} across the affected region. There were no casualties, though two local police stations suffered slight damage. A number of light aftershocks succeeded the main event, of which the strongest measured a magnitude of 4.1(ML).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Quakes</b> had a {{slightly}} turbulent offseason, with Sean Franklin, Daniel Paladini and Mike Zaher all departing for Major League Soccer, and team relocating from Granada Hills {{to a new}} stadium in nearby Calabasas. Despite impressing during a pre-season friendly against Los Angeles Galaxy, losing 3-1 to a full-strength team which included David Beckham and Landon Donovan, <b>the</b> <b>Quakes</b> suffered their worst ever start to a competitive season, winning just one of their opening six fixtures, and receiving a 5-0 walloping {{at the hands of}} Los Angeles Legends. However, a dogged 4-2 victory at home to Lancaster Rattlers in early June signaled a turnaround in fortunes, {{and for the rest of}} <b>the</b> season <b>the</b> <b>Quakes</b> were unstoppable. <b>The</b> <b>Quakes</b> remained unbeaten for the rest of the regular season, notching up victories over San Francisco Seals, San Jose Frogs, Los Angeles Legends, Fresno Fuego and Ventura County Fusion, the last of which left <b>the</b> <b>Quakes</b> on <b>the</b> verge of their first ever divisional championship. The final game of the regular season was a winner-take-all matchup against Fresno Fuego, which <b>the</b> <b>Quakes</b> won 2-1 with goals by Devin Deldo and Sung-Hyun Kim, giving the team its first silverware in franchise history. <b>The</b> <b>Quakes</b> went to <b>the</b> playoffs in Fresno on a high, but were beaten in the semi final by Northwest runners-up Vancouver Whitecaps Residency, after having a man sent off and conceding an injury time equalizer; Vancouver then added two more in extra time to secure a 3-1 victory, and send <b>the</b> <b>Quakes</b> home at <b>the</b> first hurdle for the second straight year. Devin Deldo was the team's top scorer, with 8 goals, while Sung-Hyun Kim contributed 5 assists.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Quakes</b> {{in their}} 2014 {{campaign}} began, {{playing in the}} quarterfinals against Toluca in a two-game series in the 2013–14 CONCACAF Champions League. Scoring a goal in stoppage time in the first game, <b>the</b> <b>Quakes</b> went to Mexico 1–1 on aggregate. In the second game, the game tied in regulation. <b>The</b> <b>Quakes</b> faced Toluca in Overtime where neither team could score against the other and the game went on to penalites. The Earthquakes lost 5–4 against Toluca in penalties and were eliminated.|$|R
25|$|On June 29, 2013, <b>the</b> <b>Quakes</b> played <b>the</b> L.A. Galaxy in the California Classico.

5|$|Due to the {{significantly}} slower {{propagation of}} seismic waves {{compared to the}} near-speed-of-light transmission of Internet traffic, some Twitter users read about the earthquake seconds before feeling the tremors. For example, Twitter users in such cities as New York City and Boston reported reading tweets about the earthquake from users in Washington, D.C., or Richmond, Virginia, 15 to 30seconds before feeling <b>the</b> <b>quake</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|On November 9, 2002, the World Bank granted $225million {{towards the}} {{reconstruction}} and economic {{rehabilitation of the}} area devastated by <b>the</b> <b>quake.</b> Reconstruction of housing and infrastructure by provincial authorities was interrupted for almost four months (November 2002– February 2003) due to harsh weather conditions. In August 2003, the reconstruction was completed in all villages affected by the earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Nicaragua {{earthquake}} occurred off {{the coast}} of Nicaragua at 6:16p.m. on September 2. Some damage was also reported in Costa Rica. At least 116 people were killed and several more were injured. <b>The</b> <b>quake</b> was located in an active zone of stress and deformation. It created tsunamis disproportionately large for its surface wave magnitude.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Quakes</b> are a psychobilly {{band from}} Buffalo, NY. They were formed in 1986. When the band {{began in the}} late 1980s, there was no scene to speak of in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>Quakes</b> moved to London to try to find an audience.|$|R

5|$|The first {{shock of}} the {{earthquake}} occurred at 0:16 GMT and was followed by several strong aftershocks. <b>The</b> <b>quake</b> was most widely felt in the Chinandega and León departments of Nicaragua, though it was also felt elsewhere in Nicaragua at El Crucero, Managua and San Marcos and at San José in Costa Rica. It was the strongest seismic event to hit Nicaragua since the earthquake of 1972.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>quake</b> {{was felt}} across {{more than a}} dozen U.S. states and in several Canadian provinces, and was felt by more people than any other quake in U.S. history. No deaths and only minor {{injuries}} were reported. Minor and moderate damage to buildings was widespread and was estimated by one risk-modeling company at $200million to $300million, of which about $100million was insured.|$|E
5|$|Valve {{struggled}} to find a publisher, as many believed the game was too ambitious for a first-time developer. Sierra On-Line signed Valve for a one-game deal as it was interested in making a 3D action game, especially one based on <b>the</b> <b>Quake</b> engine. Valve first showed Half-Life in early 1997; it was a success at Electronic Entertainment Expo that year, where Valve demonstrated the game's animation and artificial intelligence.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>the</b> September 2010 <b>quake,</b> <b>the</b> February 2011 earthquake struck {{on a busy}} weekday afternoon. This, along with the strength of <b>the</b> <b>quakes,</b> and <b>the</b> proximity to the city centre resulted in 181 deaths.|$|R

In December 2005, <b>The</b> <b>Quakes</b> released <b>the</b> album [...] "Psyops" [...] on Orrexx records. The album combined psychobilly {{with new}} wave and {{was recorded in}} Finland, Las Vegas and Phoenix. In 2006, <b>the</b> <b>Quakes</b> celebrated their 20-year anniversary. They did a 34 show tour of the USA and then 23 more shows all across Europe and Russia. In 2007, Orrexx records re-released the album Quiff Rock after obtaining the rights back from Tombstone records. The re-release added eight extra songs, seven {{of which had been}} unreleased. <b>The</b> <b>Quakes</b> added Kenny Hill on slap bass. The band did a short tour of the southwest in September and then a 28 show tour all over Europe.|$|R
5|$|Valve, {{based in}} Kirkland, Washington, {{was founded in}} 1996 by former Microsoft {{employees}} Mike Harrington and Gabe Newell. For its first product, Valve settled on a concept for a horror first-person shooter (FPS) using <b>the</b> <b>Quake</b> engine licensed from id Software. Valve eventually modified 70% of the engine's code, adding skeletal animation and Direct3D support.|$|E
5|$|After {{aftershocks}} from <b>the</b> <b>quake</b> had concluded, examination took place, {{producing a}} focal {{solution to the}} small events. Movement of these shocks {{was similar to that}} of previous earthquakes around the Azores. For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate nodal plane was responsible, seeing shearing on the right-lateral (dextral) side. All faulting in this area is strike-slip-oriented, and on a rather large scale. Because of this research, information now points towards Azores volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{confined}} to Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and south-central Iowa, and largely consisted of fallen chimneys, foundation cracks, collapsed parapets, and overturned tombstones. In one home in Dale, Illinois, near Tuckers Corners and southwest of McLeansboro, <b>the</b> <b>quake</b> cracked interior walls, plaster, and chimneys. Using a type of victim study, the local post office surveyed residents and implemented a field inspection which indicated the strongest shaking (MM VII) {{took place in the}} Wabash Valley, Ohio Valley, and other nearby south-central Illinois lowlands. Outside this four-state zone, oscillating objects including cars, chimneys, and the Gateway Arch were reported to authorities.|$|E

5|$|Diary of a Camper occurs entirely within <b>the</b> <b>Quake</b> map DM6 ("The Dark Zone"). After {{exploring}} {{some of the}} area, the Rangers {{gather and}} decide to send two members, Sphinx and Pyoveli, to scout a room above. After they teleport into the room, a camper waiting there kills them both, as confirmed by in-game text messages that appear on the screen. The remaining three Rangers—ColdSun, ArchV, and an unidentified member—realize their comrades' fate and return fire from a distance, killing the camper. Examining the remains, they identify their foe as John Romero.|$|E
5|$|Later {{many other}} Sicilian {{towns and cities}} which had been either little damaged or {{completely}} untouched by <b>the</b> <b>quake,</b> such as Palermo, were also transformed by the Baroque style, as the fashion spread and aristocrats with a palazzo in Catania came to wish their palazzo in the capital to be as opulent as that in the second city.
