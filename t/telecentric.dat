50|$|An {{entrance}} pupil at infinity {{makes the}} lens object-space <b>telecentric.</b> Such lenses {{are used in}} machine vision systems because image magnification is independent of the object's distance or position {{in the field of}} view. An exit pupil at infinity makes the lens image-space <b>telecentric.</b> Such lenses are used with image sensors that do not tolerate a wide range of angles of incidence. For example, a three-CCD color beamsplitter prism assembly works best with a <b>telecentric</b> lens, and many digital image sensors have a minimum of color crosstalk and shading problems when used with <b>telecentric</b> lenses.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the <b>telecentric</b> effect, these lenses are often {{used in conjunction with}} <b>telecentric</b> (or [...] "collimated") illuminators, which produce a parallel light flow, often from LED sources.|$|E
50|$|<b>Telecentric</b> lenses {{tend to be}} larger, heavier, {{and more}} {{expensive}} than normal lenses of similar focal length and f-number. This {{is partly due to}} the extra components needed to achieve telecentricity, and partly because the object or image lens elements of an object or image-space <b>telecentric</b> lens must be at least as large as the largest object to be photographed or image to be formed. , these lenses can range in cost from hundreds to thousands of US dollars or euros, depending on quality. Because of their intended applications, <b>telecentric</b> lenses often have higher resolution and transmit more light than normal photographic lenses.|$|E
50|$|A lens {{providing}} an orthographic projection {{is known as}} an object-space <b>telecentric</b> lens.|$|E
50|$|If both pupils are at infinity, {{the lens}} is double <b>telecentric</b> (or bi-telecentric).|$|E

50|$|An image-space (or image-side) <b>telecentric</b> lens {{produces}} {{images of}} the same size regardless of the distance between the lens and the film or image sensor. This allows the lens to be focused to different distances without changing the size of the image. Image-space <b>telecentric</b> lenses have an exit pupil infinitely far in front of the lens; that is, if one looks {{in the back of the}} lens, the image of the aperture is very far away.|$|E
50|$|A <b>telecentric</b> lens is a {{compound}} lens {{that has its}} entrance or exit pupil at infinity; in the prior case, this produces an orthographic view of the subject. This means that the chief rays (oblique rays that pass {{through the center of}} the aperture stop) are parallel to the optical axis in front of or behind the system, respectively. The simplest way to make a lens <b>telecentric</b> is to put the aperture stop at one of the lens's focal points.|$|E
50|$|In 2017 InspecVision {{launched}} the Accuity system {{which is an}} automated, large field of view, <b>telecentric</b> gauging system that can scan in both 2D and 3D.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Telecentric</b> {{optical path}} means that light hitting the sensor is {{traveling}} closer to {{perpendicular to the}} sensor, resulting in brighter corners, and improved off-center resolution, particularly on wide angle lenses.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} {{aperture}} must be {{centered on the}} optical axis for this to work as indicated. Using a sufficiently small aperture in the focal plane will make the lens <b>telecentric.</b>|$|E
50|$|Object-space <b>telecentric</b> lenses have an {{entrance}} pupil infinitely {{far behind the}} lens; that is, if one looks {{in the front of}} the lens, the image of the aperture is very far away.|$|E
50|$|Lenses {{that are}} double-telecentric have {{magnification}} {{that is more}} precisely constant than those that are only object-side <b>telecentric,</b> because the principal ray intercept position on the detector does not change. This property allows precise measurement of objects regardless of position.|$|E
50|$|<b>Telecentric</b> lenses, on {{the other}} hand, provide an orthographic projection, {{providing}} the same magnification at all distances. An object that is too close or {{too far from the}} lens may still be out of focus, but the resulting blurry image will have {{the same size as the}} correctly focused image would.|$|E
5000|$|POLDER {{utilizes}} a {{push broom}} scanner. The device's optical system uses a <b>telecentric</b> lens and a charged coupled device matrix with {{a resolution of}} 242x548 pixels. [...] The focal length is 3.57 mm with a focal ratio of 4.6. The field of view ranges from ±43° to ±57°, depending on the tracking method.|$|E
50|$|Because {{their images}} have {{constant}} magnification and geometry, <b>telecentric</b> lenses {{are used for}} metrology applications, when a machine vision system must determine the precise size of objects independently from their position within the FOV and even when their distance is affected by some degree of unknown variations. These lenses are also commonly used in optical lithography for forming patterns in semiconductor chips.|$|E
50|$|The photonmultiplier tube (PMT) {{can be used}} {{to detect}} the emitted photons. This device {{converts}} the emitted photon energy into electrical energy by a photocathode via a series of other electrodes. Another device is known as CCD Imager, which is composed of a set of cooled digital cameras with sensitive charge coupled device detectors and with some refined <b>telecentric</b> lenses to convert the captured photon energy into high quality images.|$|E
50|$|The {{distance}} of the exit pupil from the sensor plane determines the range of angles of incidence that light will make with the sensor. Digital image sensors often have a limited range of angles over which they will efficiently accept light, especially those that use microlenses to increase their sensitivity. The closer the exit pupil to the focal plane, the higher the angles of incidence at the extreme edges of the field. This can lead to pixel vignetting. For this reason, many small digital cameras (such as those found in cell phones) are image-space <b>telecentric.</b>|$|E
5000|$|At {{the film}} or image sensor, {{all of the}} chief rays from these lenses hit [...] "straight on", or at zero angle of incidence. This {{property}} minimizes any angle-of-incidence dependence of the sensor, or of any beam-splitter prism assembly behind the lens, such as a color separation prism in a three-CCD camera. Many lenses that have been specially optimized for digital SLR cameras are nearly <b>telecentric</b> on the image side, to avoid the vignetting and color crosstalk that occur in color filter array-based digital image sensors with oblique incident rays. The Four Thirds System uses this approach.|$|E
50|$|The {{geometric}} {{location of}} the entrance pupil is the vertex of the camera's angle of view and consequently its center of perspective, perspective point, view point, projection centre or no-parallax point. This point is important in panoramic photography, because the camera must be rotated around {{it in order to}} avoid parallax errors in the final, stitched panorama. Panoramic photographers often incorrectly refer to the entrance pupil as a nodal point, which is a different concept. Depending on the lens design, the entrance pupil location on the optical axis may be behind, within or in front of the lens system; and even at infinite distance from the lens in the case of <b>telecentric</b> systems.|$|E
50|$|Unlike older single-lens reflex (SLR) systems, Four Thirds was {{designed}} {{from the start}} to be entirely digital. Many lenses are extensively computerised, {{to the point that}} Olympus offers firmware updates for many of them. Lens design has been tailored to the requirements of digital sensors, most notably through <b>telecentric</b> designs. The size of the sensor is significantly smaller than for most DSLRs and this implies that lenses, especially telephoto lenses, can be smaller. For example, a Four Thirds lens with a 300 mm focal length would cover about the same angle of view as a 600 mm focal length lens for the 35 mm film standard, and is correspondingly more compact. Thus, the Four Thirds System has crop factor (focal length multiplier) of about 2, and while this enables longer focal length for greater magnification, it does not necessarily aid the manufacture of wide angle lenses.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the {{previous}} types, natural vignetting (also known as natural illumination falloff) {{is not due}} to the blocking of light rays. The falloff is approximated by the cos4 or [...] "cosine fourth" [...] law of illumination falloff. Here, the light falloff {{is proportional to the}} fourth power of the cosine of the angle at which the light impinges on the film or sensor array. Wideangle rangefinder designs and the lens designs used in compact cameras are particularly prone to natural vignetting. Telephoto lenses, retrofocus wideangle lenses used on SLR cameras, and <b>telecentric</b> designs in general are less troubled by natural vignetting. A gradual grey filter or postprocessing techniques may be used to compensate for natural vignetting, as it cannot be cured by stopping down the lens. Some modern lenses are specifically designed so that the light strikes the image parallel or nearly so, eliminating or greatly reducing vignetting.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of a smaller sensor, with a pixel count that matches a larger sensor, is {{the reduction in}} incoming light hitting the light sensitive part of each pixel of the sensor. This is true even if the Four Thirds camera and lens are properly designed to focus all captured light onto the smaller light circle circumscribing the smaller sensor. The reason is that a smaller pixel has a proportionately smaller light sensitive area because the pixel loses {{a larger proportion of}} its total area to secondary circuitry and edge shading than a larger pixel. With less captured light to work with each pixel output voltage requires additional amplification with associated higher signal noise, resulting in increased chromatic and color noise as well as reduced dynamic range. A <b>telecentric</b> lens design helps reduce this problem but still leaves a smaller sensor, with smaller pixels, more sensitive to the angle of incoming light, among other things producing a more pronounced image corner light fall off.|$|E
50|$|As the {{temperature}} of the sample has a significant influence on the optical rotation of the sample, modern polarimeters have already included Peltier Elements to actively control {{the temperature}}. Special techniques like a temperature controlled sample tube reduce measuring errors and ease operation. Results can directly be transferred to computers or networks for automatic processing.Traditionally, accurate filling of the sample cell had to be checked outside the instrument, as an appropriate control from within the device was not possible. Nowadays a camera system allows accurate monitoring of the sample and filling conditions in the sample cell from inside the instrument.A <b>telecentric</b> camera gives a sharp image over the complete length of any sample cell placed within modern instruments. The online monitoring of the filling process ensures that no bubbles or particles obstruct the measurement. A picture can be saved together with the recorded data. Any temperature gradients, inhomogeneous sample distributions or air bubbles can immediately be recognized before measurement, so that potential errors caused by bubbles or particles are no longer an issue.|$|E
5000|$|This section gives a brief {{introduction}} {{to the subject of}} [...] "Equivalence" [...] in photography. Equivalent images are made by photographing the same angle of view, with the same depth of field and the same Angular resolution due to diffraction limitation (which requires different f-stops on different focal length lenses), the same motion blur (requires the same shutter speed), therefore the ISO setting must differ to compensate for the f-stop difference. The use of this is only to let us compare the effectiveness of the sensors given the same amount of light hitting them. In normal photography with any one camera, equivalence is not necessarily an issue: there are several lenses faster than f/2.4 for micro four thirds (see the tables under Fixed Focal Length Lenses, below), and there are certainly many lenses faster than f/4.8 for full frame and no one hesitates to use them even though they can have shallower depth of field than a Nikon 1 at f/1.7, in fact that can be seen as advantageous, {{but it has to be}} taken into consideration that a further aspect of image resolution is limitation by optical aberration, which can be compensated the better the smaller the focal lengths of a lens is. Lenses designed for mirrorless camera systems such as Nikon 1 or Micro Four Thirds often use image-space <b>telecentric</b> lens designs, which reduce shading and therefore light loss and blurring at the microlenses of the image sensor. Furthermore, in low light conditions by using low f-numbers a too shallow depth of field can lead to less satisfying image results, especially in videography, when the object taken by the camera or the camera itself are moving. For those interested in producing equivalent images, read on.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn general, the {{applications}} of <b>telecentric</b> lens {{can be divided}} into two major groups, the first one is the <b>telecentric</b> macro lens (TML) commonly used in machine vision inspection and the other one is the <b>telecentric</b> digital-micro-imaging lens (TDMIL), which is a specific magnification of <b>telecentric</b> lens coupled with a pocket digital camera. Due to the limitation of CCD's resolution, the image quality captured by TML cannot meet the biomedical requirement. In order to improve the image quality and the convenience of measurement, the TDMIL can be recommended as a simple instrument to measure the size of an object. However, if the high resolution microscopy image and the minimum total length of TDMIL are required simultaneously, the total magnification of TDMIL system should be less than 5 X. This paper presents a micro-scale measurement approach that is performed by the TDMIL coupled with the projection scale pattern, and is easy to get the size of an object...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{approach}} to constant-magnification imaging is proposed. Magnification variations due {{to changes in}} focus setting pose problems for important vision techniques, such as, depth from defocus.

The system was designed for in vivo imaging of burns; therefore, we acquired images from samples located at distances greater than 24 cm from the exit of the <b>telecentric</b> system. Each system variation had a specific combination of diameters for the reference and sample beams. In the reference arm, we used, alternately, two collimated beams with diameters of 1. 5 and 14 mm, respectively. In the sample arm, we tested collimated beams with the following diameters: 1. 5, 3. 5, 5. 7, 8. 4, and 14 mm. A galvanometric mirror system scanned the collimated sample beam across the entrance pupil of the <b>telecentric</b> system. The sample beam exited the <b>telecentric</b> system parallel with its optical axis and convergent onto the sample.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the first high-speed system for slope imaging of wind-induced short water waves. The imaging slope gauge method is used, {{which is based}} on the shape from refraction principle. The downward looking camera with a <b>telecentric</b> lens observes the refraction of light rays coming from a high power custom <b>telecentric</b> LED light source that is placed underneath the wind wave facility. The light source can be programmed to arbitrary intensity gradients in the x- and y-direction, so that the origin of a light ray is coded in intensity. Four gradient images (acquired at 6000 fps) are combined for one 2 D slope image. By only using intensity ratios, the measurements become independent of lens effects from the curved water surface and inhomogeneities in the light source. Independence of wave height is guaranteed by using <b>telecentric</b> illumination and <b>telecentric</b> imaging. The system is capable to measure the slopes of a wind-driven water surface in the Heidelberg Aeolotron wind-wave facility on a footprint of 200 x 160 mm with a spatial resolution of 0. 22 mm and a temporal resolution of more than 1500 fps.
