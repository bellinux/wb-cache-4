5|$|In PC Magazine testing, Norton removed most {{traces of}} 40 {{percent of the}} malware. On a similar test, {{specifically}} using commercial keyloggers, Norton was able to remove most of the keyloggers, beating other tested products. Norton blocked all attempts to install malware on a clean system. Modifications made to the samples did not fool Norton. Norton was not able <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>the</b> installation of all the commercial keyloggers.|$|E

Various politicians, including members of the United States House of Representatives, opposed the idea and attempted <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>the</b> series. Eventually, Angelos secured the approval in 1999, after a change in United States foreign policy to Cuba under President Bill Clinton, which eased travel restrictions and increased cultural exchange.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet forces {{attempted}} to capture Estonia and its capital Tallinn. Stavka hoped a quick breakthrough at the Emajõgi front would open {{a path for}} the armoured units to the north, thus cutting the Army Detachment Narwa {{off from the rest}} of Army Group North.

3000|$|The {{first step}} in the test {{assembly}} is to determine <b>the</b> number of <b>blocks</b> and <b>the</b> assignment of items <b>to</b> those <b>blocks.</b> <b>The</b> function block_design facilitates this process with two required arguments and one optional argument. The n_blocks argument specifies <b>the</b> number of <b>blocks</b> while <b>the</b> item_parameters argument takes a data frame of item parameters. The default allocation of items <b>to</b> <b>blocks</b> is a spiraling design. For 1, 2, [...]..., H item <b>blocks,</b> <b>the</b> first item is assigned <b>to</b> <b>block</b> 1, item 2 is assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>block</b> 2, and item H is assigned <b>to</b> <b>block</b> H. <b>The</b> process is continued such that item H+ 1 is assigned <b>to</b> <b>block</b> 1, item H+ 2 is assigned <b>to</b> <b>block</b> 2 and item H+H is assigned <b>to</b> <b>block</b> H until all items are assigned <b>to</b> a <b>block.</b>|$|R

Brock Hall was eventually sold in 1969 and converted into flats.|$|E
5|$|Titan {{is never}} {{visible to the}} naked eye, but can be {{observed}} through small telescopes or strong binoculars. Amateur observation is difficult because of the proximity of Titan to Saturn's brilliant globe and ring system; an occulting bar, covering part of the eyepiece and used <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>the</b> bright planet, greatly improves viewing. Titan has a maximum apparent magnitude of +8.2, and mean opposition magnitude 8.4. This compares to +4.6 for the similarly sized Ganymede, in the Jovian system.|$|E

5|$|A large {{force of}} Israeli {{infantry}} and armor went east <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>the</b> road from Salt to the Allenby bridge, and they encountered the Jordanian 60th Armored Brigade trying {{to join the}} defense of Karameh. In the resulting battle, the Jordanians lost eight Patton tanks without destroying any Israeli tanks, then withdrew to the hills to dig in and continue firing down on the Israelis. The Israeli Air Force launched airstrikes against Jordanian armor and artillery positions, {{but was unable to}} stop the firing. Within the next two hours, Israeli artillery fire and airstrikes were launched against Jordanian defenses on the Musri-Karameh road, the Salt road, and east of Abdullah Bridge. The Israelis also consolidated their hold on Karameh with airstrikes and artillery, and began demolishing the camp. A total of 175 houses were blown up.|$|E

These private concerns won at both the trial court and at the Washington Supreme Court. Washington Attorney General Slade Gorton, representing the state of Washington, supported the position of the private concerns and opposed the position of the United States and the tribes. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and vacated the decision of the Washington Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|After {{considerable}} argument, {{the decision}} to proceed ultimately fell to an unlikely political expediency. At the time, the UK was pressing for admission to the European Common Market, which was being controlled by Charles de Gaulle who felt the UK's Special Relationship with the US made them unacceptable in a pan-European group. Cabinet felt that signing a deal with Sud would {{pave the way for}} Common Market entry, and this became the main deciding reason for moving ahead with the deal. It was this belief that had led the original STAC documents being leaked to the French. However, De Gaulle spoke of the European origin of the design, and continued <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>the</b> UK's entry into the Common Market.|$|E

5|$|Antiandrogens such as {{cyproterone}} acetate and spironolactone {{have been}} used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combination oral contraceptives, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The drug is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and {{is thought to be}} a useful acne treatment due to its ability <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>the</b> androgen receptor at higher doses. It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive. Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant. Finasteride is likely an effective treatment for acne.|$|E
5|$|As British {{forces on}} the {{southeast}} coast of Britain regrouped, remanned and repaired following heavy losses at Zeebrugge, Keyes planned a return to Ostend {{with the intention of}} blocking the canal and consequently severing Bruges from the sea, closing the harbour and trapping the 18U-boats and 25destroyers present for months to come. Volunteers from among the force that had failed in April aided the planning with advice based on their experience on the previous operation. Among these volunteers were Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy of , Commander Alfred Godsal, former captain of , and Brilliants first lieutenant Victor Crutchley. These officers approached Commodore Hubert Lynes and Admiral Roger Keyes with a refined plan for a second attempt <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>the</b> port. Other officers came forward to participate and Keyes and Lynes devised an operational plan to attack the canal mouth at Ostend once again.|$|E
