5|$|The {{following}} season a {{new ground}} {{was built for}} Hull City {{across the road from}} the cricket ground. Still under the managership of Ambrose Langley, Hull continued to finish consistently in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the table. They came close to promotion in the 1909–10 season, recording what would be their highest finish until they matched it in 2008. Hull finished third, level on points with second placed Oldham Athletic, missing promotion on goal average by 0.29 of a goal. Hull regularly finished in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the table before the First World War, but after the war the team finished in the bottom half in seven seasons out of eleven, culminating in relegation to the Third Division North in 1930.|$|E
5|$|After {{growing up}} in Toxteth, Liverpool, Nolan signed for Bolton Wanderers {{at the age of}} 16. Part of the team that beat Preston North End in the 2001 First Division play-offs to gain {{promotion}} to the Premier League, he soon became a regular first-team player for the club.

A victory against St Johnstone in their penultimate league match lifted Hearts into fifth place, a qualifying position. Hearts then rested some players for their final league match, a 5–0 defeat by Celtic. Entering the week before the cup final, Hearts had concerns about the fitness of striker Craig Beattie, who was unable to train due to a hamstring injury.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years, Australia's athletes did poorly; only two athletes {{placed in the}} <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> their events before 1976, while the vast {{majority}} placed in the bottom quarter, including some who finished last. This lack of success was attributed to the Australian culture, climate and lack of snow, {{as well as the}} lack of support for the athletes—sports administrators regarded investment in winter sports as futile.|$|E
5|$|Napoli {{entered the}} Serie A era under the {{management}} of William Garbutt. During Garbutt's six-year stint, the club would be dramatically transformed, frequently finishing in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the table. This included two third-place finishes during the 1932–33 and 1933–34 seasons, with added notables such as Antonio Vojak, Arnaldo Sentimenti and Carlo Buscaglia. However, in the {{years leading up to}} World War II, Napoli went into decline, only surviving relegation in 1939–40 by goal average.|$|E

5|$|Australia first {{competed in}} figure skating in 1952, and has competed in 1956, 1960 and every Olympics since 1980. In earlier years, Australia earned some last places or near-misses. Until 1988, no Australian had placed above the 20th percentile, but results have slowly improved; Anthony Liu {{finished}} 10th out of 28 {{competitors in the}} men's event in 2002. Joanne Carter represented Australia in 1998 & 2006. She had placed 12th in 2002 and apart from Liu is the only Australian to have placed in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the field. In 2010, Australia's lone participant Cheltzie Lee came 20th. Australia has competed in ice dancing only twice—in 1988 and 2014—when their solitary representative in both the men and women's individual event came last.|$|E
5|$|Australia has {{competed in}} either the long track or short track forms of speed skating at every Olympics that it has attended, except 1964.

Colin Hickey finished seventh in 1956 in the 500 and 1,000m long track speed skating, and placed 13th and 14th four years later. Until 1968, Hickey's four aforementioned results were the only times that an Australian finished in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> their event.|$|E

5|$|Brooklyn went hitless in {{the bottom}} of the eighth. They {{inserted}} Harry Taylor to pitch the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the ninth, in which, he held St. Louis hitless. With half an inning left to play, the Dodgers began to get hits off of Dickson. Galan doubled, and after Walker flied out, Ed Stevens tripled to score Galan and Furillo singled to score Stevens, after a wild pitch and a walk, Brecheen took over pitching duties for Dickson with St. Louis leading 8–3. Edwards singled off Brecheen and allowed Furillo to score, and after Cookie Lavagetto walked, the score was 8–4 with the bases loaded. The Cardinals kept the score from getting any closer, as Brecheen struck out the final two batters to end the game.|$|E

The last game of the season, at the Boleyn Ground, saw West Ham draw 2–2 against Aston Villa, ensuring a tenth-place finish three points ahead of rivals Tottenham Hotspur. It was a five-place improvement on the previous season, and most importantly West Ham were never under any realistic threat of relegation.|$|E

5|$|Stengel was {{introduced}} as Yankee manager on October 12, 1948, the 25th {{anniversary of his}} second World Series home run to beat the Yankees. Joe DiMaggio attended the press conference {{as a sign of}} team support. Stengel faced obstacles to being accepted—Harris had been popular with the press and public, and the businesslike Yankee corporate culture and successful tradition were thought to be ill matched with a manager who had the reputation of a clown and who had never had a major league team finish in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the standings. Stengel's MLB involvement had been in the National League, and there were several American League parks in which he had neither managed nor played.|$|E

When the regional Third Divisions were to be combined into national Third and Fourth Divisions after the 1957–58 campaign, Stockport finished in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the Third Division North and so {{were placed in the}} following season's national Third Division.|$|E
