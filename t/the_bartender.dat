40|$|Bartending is an {{important}} aspect of the service industry. As with any occupation, bartending is a job that must be learned. The purpose of this thesis was to explore how ten males were socialized into the role of nightshift bartender. In line with Akers 2 ̆ 7 social learning theory, <b>the</b> <b>bartenders</b> in this study learned the various aspects of their job through differential association, differential reinforcement, imitation, and definition formation. They were exposed to and learned a number of work-related behaviours that could be defined as deviant, including: excessive alcohol consumption, sexual activity, and cash scams and hustles. Interestingly, {{the findings of this study}} indicate that non-deviant and deviant behaviours were learned through the same processes and involved interaction with other members of the bar subculture. For many of <b>the</b> <b>bartenders</b> in this study, deviant behaviours became normal aspects of their occupation. Once <b>the</b> <b>bartenders</b> learned their roles including the various behaviours associated with bartending, many of <b>the</b> veteran <b>bartenders</b> experienced a sense of mastery and control over their occupation, that some referred to as 2 ̆ 2 achieving the zone. 2 ̆ 2 Dept. of Sociology and Anthropology.
