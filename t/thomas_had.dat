5|$|The {{trial judge}} also {{concluded}} that <b>Thomas</b> <b>had</b> been properly informed {{of his right}} to silence, and had not been induced by the AFP officers {{to participate in the}} interview by offer of repatriation or any other reward. Ultimately he decided that <b>Thomas</b> <b>had</b> participated voluntarily in the interview, and that in the circumstances, Thomas' lack of legal advice should not make the record of the interview inadmissible.|$|E

5|$|Bush {{initially}} {{wanted to}} nominate Thomas to replace William Brennan, who stepped down in 1990, but he then decided that <b>Thomas</b> <b>had</b> not yet had enough {{experience as a}} judge after only months on the federal bench.

5|$|By summer 821, <b>Thomas</b> <b>had</b> {{consolidated}} {{his position}} in the East, though the Opsician and Armeniac themes still eluded his control. He {{set his sights on}} the ultimate prize, Constantinople, the possession of which alone conferred full legitimacy to an emperor. Thomas assembled troops, gathered supplies, and built siege machines. To counter the powerful Imperial Fleet stationed in the capital, he built new ships to augment his existing fleet, which came from the Cibyrrhaeot and Aegean Sea naval themes, and possibly included task forces from the theme of Hellas. Thomas recalled Gregory Pterotos, a general and nephew of Leo V whom Michael had exiled to the island of Skyros, and gave him command of the fleet. By October, the thematic fleets loyal to <b>Thomas</b> <b>had</b> finished assembling at Lesbos, and Thomas's army began marching from the Thracesian Theme towards Abydos, where he intended to cross over into Europe.|$|E

5|$|Judith and <b>Thomas</b> <b>had</b> three children: Shakespeare, Richard, and Thomas. Shakespeare Quiney died at {{six months}} of age, and neither Richard nor Thomas lived past 21.

5|$|Country Bill's Restaurant {{opened in}} 1964 after Ron Thomas' family {{purchased}} the business from Bill Blake for $600.

Though he was not fond of the lounge's name, Thomas was unable to afford new signage and kept the title. Over time the restaurant grew from a hamburger stand into a family dining restaurant, expanding east from one space to four.

5|$|Grimshaw {{was born}} in or around Great Harwood, Lancashire, in 1824 or 1825 {{and was one of}} six {{children}} brought up in a working-class family.

5|$|No further {{information}} on the bishop's activities has survived before he was granted resignation by Pope Innocent IV on 21 February 1245. According to the Pope, <b>Thomas</b> <b>had</b> admitted committing several felonies, such as torturing a man to death, and forging a papal letter. Church representatives to oversee the resignation were the Archbishop of Uppsala and the Dominican prior of the Dacian province. Thomas donated his books to the newly established Dominican convent in Sigtuna {{and went on to}} live his last years in the Dominican convent in Visby, Gotland.

5|$|On 4 January 2003, Thomas was apprehended by Pakistani {{immigration}} officials {{at an airport}} {{in the city of}} Karachi, and taken into custody. <b>Thomas</b> <b>had</b> with him items including an Australian-issue passport, an airline ticket for travel to Indonesia, and about $ 3,800 in cash. The passport, issued on 19 May 1993, had been tampered with, for the intention of concealing the details of Thomas' movements after his departure from Australia in 2001.
