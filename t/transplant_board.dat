During the operation, her father nearly dies, but he is saved by Elliot and Faye. After the anguish of the redundancies and the situation with her father, Connie decides that she can't work at Holby any more, and hands her resignation to Hanssen. Before she leaves, she tells Hanssen that firing Elliot would be a big mistake. Connie later meets with Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel), giving her some final tips and fashion advice. She revealed to Jac that she will be working in Brussels two days a week for the European <b>Transplant</b> <b>Board,</b> as well as caring for her father. Upon hearing that Jac has been hired as her replacement, she sends her a bottle of champagne and a pair of her shoes with a card saying [...] "Fill them!".|$|E

40|$|The current deceased-donor kidney {{allocation}} {{system in}} the U. S. has been in existence for more than 20 years. Over the last 4 {{years there has been}} a dedicated effort toward {{the development of a new}} system of transplant allocation. The development of a new kid-ney allocation system has been driven by the competing goals of improving the util-ity of kidney transplantation and enhanc-ing the equity of the system. A number of trends in kidney transplantation informed the framers of the new allocation system proposal. The average age of waitlisted can-didates has increased (Figure 1), resulting in the transplantation of older candidates with multiple cardiovascular comorbidities. Consequently, there has been a marked increase in recipients dying with otherwise functional allografts 1 and a simultaneous decline in estimated post-transplant survival (Figure 2). In addition, much of the work on the system revision has been driven by an interest in eliminating extreme mismatches between donor kidney and recipient surviv-als. This article reviews the history of the development of the new allocation system proposal, discusses the expected outcomes if such a proposal is adopted, and discusses the progress to date toward implementation of a new kidney allocation system. Revision of the Allocation System The fi rst steps toward revision of the alloca-tion system began in 2004 when the Organ Procurement <b>Transplant</b> Network (OPTN) <b>Board</b> of Directors charged the Kidney Transplantation Committee (KTC) with performing a comprehensive review of the current allocation algorithm. The subse-quent kidney allocation review subcom-mittee (KARS) report concluded that the allocation system was inequitable, lacked predictability, and did not effectively uti-lize the potential life years available from donor kidneys. 2 The current system was also shown to be no longer consistent with sections of the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) of 19843 or the OPTN Final Rule, 4 the 2 directives that guide orga...|$|R
40|$|Status 1 is {{the listing}} {{category}} reserved for patients awaiting liver transplantation {{who are at}} risk of imminent death. This high allocation priority was intended to benefit patients with acute liver failure and children with severe chronic liver failure. However, the status 1 criteria were not well defined. The aims of this study, which used the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database for patients wait-listed between February 27, 2002, and September 30, 2003, were to determine the indication and numbers of children and adults at status 1 (including regional variations); examine death rates on the waiting list for children at vs. not at status 1; and examine time to death, transplant, or removal from the waiting list for both pediatric and adult status 1 candidates. During the study period, 40. 3 % of children and 6. 1 % of adults were transplanted at status 1. The indication was acute liver failure in 52. 1 % of adults and 31 % of children. Among status 1 <b>transplants,</b> Regional Review <b>Board</b> exceptions were granted for 16. 7 % of children and 10. 1 % of adults. Death rates for children listed at status 1 by exception per patient-year at risk were substantially lower (0. 51) than those of children with acute liver failure (4. 06) or with chronic liver disease and Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease score ≥ 25 (4. 63). The percentage of adults who died while on the waiting list within 90 days of listing was more than twice that of children, whereas the percentages transplanted were similar. Patients listed and transplanted at status 1 were a heterogeneous population with an overrepresentation of children with varying degrees of chronic liver disease and other exceptions, and an associated wide variation in waiting list mortality. Recent changes in status 1 criteria provide stricter definitions, particularly for children, including the removal of the “by exception” category, with the intent that all candidates listed at status 1 share a similar mortality risk.

40|$|In 2016, the Department of Surgery {{launched}} the Support of Surgery Research Activities Pilot Grant Program. In {{the first year}} alone, six projects were approved and funded. Recognizing the importance of innovative research {{and the success of}} this funding model, the Robert Saligman Charitable Foundation made a generous contribution in June 2017 to bolster future exploratory studies. The new Saligman Family Surgery Pilot Grant Program encourages faculty members, residents and fellows to apply for grants of up to $ 15, 000 per year to pursue independent research programs. Here are updates from the principal investigators of three ongoing studies. “This funding mechanism is invaluable for our faculty, residents, and medical students to initiate important clinical research projects and address questions that we hope may ultimately improve patient care at Jefferson. ” – Jonathan R. Brody, PhD J. Wallace Davis and Gail G. Davis Professor of Surgery Director, Division of Surgical Research Vice Chair for Research Department of Surgery _____________________________________________ Reducing colorectal surgical site infections “Several years ago, I attended an American College of Surgeons meeting and saw a poster presentation about the use of lidocaine in cholecystectomy wounds. Lidocaine either kills or stops reproduction of many bacterial organisms, and had a dramatic impact on reducing surgical site infection in cholecystectomy patients. I thought, ‘Why don’t we give that a try in colorectal cases?’ With the use of lidocaine, we found that our rate of surgical site infection declined, but we couldn’t prove how. “With this lab-based study, we have microbiologists and surgical residents, Brock Hewitt MD, MPH, and Sami Tannouri, MD, working together to explore how another local anesthetic, bupivocaine, works to prevent surgical site infections. Bupivocaine can be delivered alone or can be bound with liposomes, or fat, so that it lasts longer. “We are working to understand whether or not liposomal binding affects wound infection rates. What are the bacteriologic effects? In other words, is liposomal bupivocaine better, worse or about the same as traditional bupivocaine or lidocaine? In the next few months, we hope to have results that can help us understand the best drug to use to prevent these infections. ” ______________________________________________ ‘Personalizing’ transplant decision making “Across the <b>board,</b> <b>transplant</b> programs do a great job in collecting and analyzing population-level data. Every program reports the same data about how it’s doing in terms of graft function and loss, as well as patient outcomes over time. Our regulators publish reports about our one- and three-year outcomes – evaluations that typically shape key decisions about which patients receive which organs. I became curious: What would the decisions and metrics look like if we optimized transplantation based on what is best for each individual patient? “In this study, we are analyzing national data to develop a model that helps programs make more tailored decisions when they receive offers of organs from their organ procurement organization. We’re looking at specific patient variables, such as age, sex, race, disease and time on dialysis, and trying to determine the expected long-term outcome for people with a certain set of characteristics. What would we expect those patients’ organ offers to be at a particular time? What about one year later? “Ultimately, such models can help transplant programs make better decisions at the individual patient level and achieve even better population-level outcomes. ” Exploring disparities that impact cancer care “When it comes to care for cancer patients, we look at two factors: efficacy and effectiveness. Efficacy is whether or not a treatment works, while effectiveness is how the treatment performs in the real world. In other words, a treatment may work, but if patients aren’t consistently receiving or tolerating it, there can be differences in outcomes that are not appreciated. Having treated patients {{from a wide variety of}} backgrounds and with a broad range of diseases and presentations, I’ve come to realize there are differences in patient presentations and outcomes that are outside of biology. “Building on previous work exploring disparities in early-stage breast cancer treatment, this particular study is building a dataset based on Jefferson patients. We’re analyzing their pathology alongside demographic variables, such as ethnicity, insurance status, occupation and the ZIP code where the patient lives. We can then assess the decisions patients made and the actions they took. Did they complete the recommended treatment on time? Which groups were most at ease with the treatment? Where did people fall off the path? What are the critical points where we might intervene? “Once you have those kinds of insights, you can make the most effective intervention. But if we don’t study and understand the risks to our patients, we’re going in somewhat blind – not really appreciating the external circumstances that can impact our care. ” To learn more about supporting innovative surgical research at Jefferson, please visit giving. jefferson. edu or contact Kelly Austin in the Office of Institutional Advancement at 215 - 955 - 6383 or Kelly.
