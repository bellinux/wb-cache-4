5|$|After {{the failure}} of her 1986 film Shanghai Surprise, Madonna decided to sign another comedy film titled Slammer, which was later renamed to Who's That Girl. However, she had to {{convince}} both Warner Bros. and the producers of <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> she {{was ready for the}} project. Madonna enlisted her friend James Foley to direct the film. Shooting began in New York in October 1986, and continued until March 1987. Production was halted during December due to snowfall in New York. Madonna utilized the time to work on her next tour and the soundtrack of the film.|$|E

5|$|An {{earlier version}} of <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> was edited before it was {{publicly}} screened had included a painting class on the lunar base that included Kubrick's daughters, additional scenes {{of life on the}} base, and Floyd buying a bush baby from a department store via videophone for his daughter. A ten-minute black-and-white opening sequence featuring interviews with actual scientists, including Freeman Dyson discussing off-Earth life, was removed after an early screening for MGM executives. The text survives in the book The Making of Kubrick's 2001 by Jerome Agel.|$|E
5|$|Art {{directors}} Kathy Altieri and Richard Chavez and Production Designer Darek Gogol led {{a team of}} nine visual development {{artists in}} setting a visual style for <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> was representative of the time, the scale and the architectural style of Ancient Egypt. Part of the process also included the research and collection of artwork from various artists, as well as taking part in trips such as a two-week travel across Egypt by the filmmakers before the film's production began.|$|E
5|$|Clint Eastwood {{is dressed}} as the Man with No Name from the Dollars Trilogy films. The film Paint Your Wagon is {{referenced}} {{at the beginning}} of the episode.

5|$|For {{scenes in}} <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> {{featured}} {{the moon in}} the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit {{to make it look}} like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, as a source for lighting.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to At Close Range, Foley also directed the song's video. David Naylor and Sharon Oreck {{were in charge}} of the production.

5|$|Perlman {{began working}} on the {{screenplay}} in 2009. Producer Kevin Feige first publicly mentioned Guardians of the Galaxy as a potential film in 2010 and Marvel Studios announced it was in active development at the San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2012. Gunn was hired to write and direct <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> September. In February 2013, Pratt was hired to play Peter Quill / Star-Lord, and the supporting cast members were subsequently confirmed.

5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the film}} took place in India over five months. Khan spent his first two days as director blocking the first scene to be filmed—Ishaan returning {{home from school and}} putting away his recently collected fish—and becoming comfortable with his new responsibilities. Believing that the audience should not be aware of the camera, he chose a simple shooting style for <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> involved relatively little camera movement.|$|E
5|$|Warner Bros. {{originally}} planned {{to release the}} film on December 25, 1991. It first premiered at the Miami International Film Festival on February 7, 1992 before being released theatrically on February 28, 1992. The Mambo Kings was released on VHS and laserdisc on September 2, 1992, and on DVD on August 17, 2005. The DVD includes an unrated version of <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> restores one deleted scene. Other features include a behind-the-scenes featurette and an audio commentary by Arne Glimcher.|$|E
5|$|Weisberger {{is widely}} {{believed}} to have based Miranda on Anna Wintour, the powerful editor of Vogue. Wintour reportedly warned major fashion designers who {{had been invited to}} make cameo appearances as themselves in <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> they would be banished from the magazine's pages if they did so. Vogue and other major women's and fashion magazines have avoided reviewing or even mentioning the book in their pages. Wintour's spokespeople deny the claim, but costume designer Patricia Field says many designers told her {{they did not want to}} risk Wintour's wrath.|$|E

5|$|Broccoli had {{originally}} hired Richard Maibaum {{and his friend}} Wolf Mankowitz to write Dr. Nos screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman. An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey. Mankowitz left the movie, and Maibaum then undertook a second version, more closely {{in line with the}} novel. Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared it would be a disaster. Johanna Harwood and thriller writer Berkely Mather then worked on Maibaum's script. Terence Young described Harwood as a script doctor who helped put elements more in tune with a British character. Harwood stated in an interview in a Cinema Retro special on the making of <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; and claimed both her screenplays for Dr. No and her screenplay for From Russia with Love had followed Fleming's novels closely.|$|E
5|$|Docter {{began work}} on <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> would become Monsters, Inc. in 1996 while others focused on A Bug's Life (1998) and Toy Story 2 (1999). Its code name was Hidden City, named for Docter's {{favorite}} restaurant in Point Richmond. By early-February 1997, Docter had drafted a treatment together with Harley Jessup, Jill Culton, and Jeff Pidgeon that bore some resemblance to the final film. Docter pitched the story to Disney with some initial artwork on February 4 that year. He and his story team left with some suggestions in hand and returned to pitch a refined {{version of the story}} on May 30. At this pitch meeting, longtime Disney animator Joe Grant– whose work stretched back to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)– suggested the title Monsters, Inc., a play on the title of a gangster film Murder, Inc., which stuck. The film marks the first Pixar feature to not be directed by Lasseter instead being helmed by Docter, as well as Lee Unkrich and David Silverman who served as co-directors.|$|E
5|$|Fifty {{people are}} interviewed in the film, {{including}} investigative journalist Paul Radu of Bucharest, Katherine Chon of the Polaris Project, and Iana Matei of Reaching Out Romania. Don Brewster of Agape International Missions {{says that all}} of the girls they have rescued from child sex tourism in Cambodia identify Americans as the clients who were the most abusive to them. The film was dedicated to Richard Young, its cinematographer and co-director, after he died in December 2010. It had its premiere the following month at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. The narration was completely rerecorded in 2011, replacing Ashley Judd's voice with that of Glenn Close. The version of <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> was aired by CNN International as part of the CNN Freedom Project was shorter than the version shown at the premiere. In 2014, a re-edited version of the film was released.|$|E

5|$|Grissom {{has been}} noted and remembered in many film and {{television}} productions. Before he became widely known as an astronaut, the film Air Cadet (1951) starring Richard Long and Rock Hudson briefly featured Grissom early in the movie as a U.S. Air Force candidate for flight school at Randolph Field, San Antonio, Texas. Grissom was depicted by Fred Ward in the film The Right Stuff (1983) and (very briefly) in the film Apollo 13 (1995) by Steve Bernie. He was portrayed in the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon (1998) by Mark Rolston. Actor Kevin McCorkle played Grissom in the third-season finale of the NBC television show American Dreams. Bryan Cranston played Grissom as a nervous variety-show guest in <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>That</b> Thing You Do! Actor Joel Johnstone portrays Gus Grissom in the 2015 ABC TV series The Astronaut Wives Club.|$|E
5|$|In November 1966 Life {{published}} {{a series of}} photographs from <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> Abraham Zapruder took of the Kennedy assassination. Alvarez, an expert in optics and photoanalysis, became intrigued by the pictures and began to study what could {{be learned from the}} film. Alvarez demonstrated both in theory and experiment that the backward snap of the President's head was fully consistent with his being shot from behind. He also investigated the timing of the gunshots and the shockwave which disturbed the camera, and the speed of the camera, pointing out a number of things which the FBI photoanalysts either overlooked or got wrong. He produced a paper intended as a tutorial, with informal advice for the physicist intent on arriving at the truth.|$|E
5|$|In October 1992, TriStar Pictures and Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment were {{planning}} to start production on Zorro the following year, and hired Joel Gross to rewrite the script after they were impressed with his adaptation of The Three Musketeers. At the time, Spielberg was producing Zorro {{with the potential to}} direct. Gross completed his rewrite in March 1993, and TriStar entered pre-production, creating early promotion for <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>that</b> same month at the ShoWest trade show. By December 1993, Branko Lustig was producing the film with Spielberg, and Mikael Salomon was attached as director. In August 1994, Sean Connery was cast as Don Diego de la Vega, while Salomon stated {{that the rest of the}} major cast would be Hispanic or Latino. Pre-production proceeded even further in August when Salomon compiled test footage for a planned April 1995 start date.|$|E
