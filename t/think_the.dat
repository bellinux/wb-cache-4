5|$|The {{occurrence}} of planktonic foraminifera across the K–Pg boundary {{has been studied}} since the 1930s. Research spurred {{by the possibility of}} an impact event at the K–Pg boundary resulted in numerous publications detailing planktonic foraminiferal extinction at the boundary, however, there is debate ongoing between groups that <b>think</b> <b>the</b> evidence indicates substantial extinction of these species at the K–Pg boundary, and those who <b>think</b> <b>the</b> evidence supports multiple extinctions and expansions through the boundary.|$|E

5|$|A {{reference}} to The Simpsons appearance in The Tracey Ullman Show is made when the Griffins are shown as {{characters in the}} show. Family Guy producer David A.

5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{investigates the}} {{hijacking}} of an Avro Vulcan loaded with two atomic bombs, {{which had been}} taken by SPECTRE. The organisation demands a ransom {{for the return of}} the bombs. Bond follows a lead to the Bahamas, where he meets up with his CIA counterpart and friend Felix Leiter. The pair suspect a rich playboy, Emilio Largo, and search the area around his yacht and then the area where they <b>think</b> <b>the</b> yacht may have travelled. After finding the plane—but without the nuclear devices on board—the two agents arrange for Largo's yacht to be tracked and ambushed once the bombs are being moved by Largo.|$|E

5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they <b>think</b> <b>the</b> right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E

Rowling later explained her position in more detail, saying that although she opposed most of Benjamin Netanyahu's actions she did not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> cultural boycott would bring about the removal of Israel's leader or help improve the situation in Israel and Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{this story}} was simply content to show {{absolute}} power corrupting absolutely. Unfortunately, aside from Persis, none of the Augments stop {{to think about what}} they're doing or why, and the story of Malik is content to blandly repeat the story of Khan, but without the crucial personal motivator of revenge. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> writers owed the material more than this.|$|E

McMillen further praised {{the flexibility of the}} Steam platform, which does not require games to obtain ESRB ratings to be published on the service, and the freedom it gave to the publishers regardless of the game content.|$|E

5|$|The {{observed}} {{power output}} of 4.7 gigawatts is challenging to explain from tidal heating alone, so {{the main source}} of heat remains a mystery. Most scientists <b>think</b> <b>the</b> observed heat flux of Enceladus is not enough to maintain the subsurface ocean, and therefore any subsurface ocean must be a remnant of a period of higher eccentricity and tidal heating, or the heat is produced through another mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The animal's sense organ is altered when it detects an object. This causes a perceptual {{change in the}} animal's seat of sensation, which Aristotle {{believed}} was the heart, not as we now <b>think</b> <b>the</b> brain. This in turn causes {{a change in the}} heart's heat, which causes a quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration {{in the heat of the}} heart also causes a change in the consistency of the joints, which helps the limb to move.|$|E

50|$|As a witch, Tiffany {{possesses}} First Sight, {{the ability}} to see 'what is really there' (as opposed to second sight, which shows people what they think ought to be there). She also possesses Second Thoughts, which are defined as 'the thoughts you <b>think</b> about <b>the</b> way you think'. Whilst other witches are said to have this trait as well, Tiffany also recognizes some of her thoughts as Third Thoughts (<b>the</b> thoughts you <b>think</b> about <b>the</b> way you <b>think</b> about <b>the</b> way you <b>think),</b> and Fourth Thoughts (<b>the</b> thoughts you <b>think</b> about <b>the</b> way you <b>think</b> about <b>the</b> way you <b>think</b> about <b>the</b> way you <b>think).</b> All these thoughts sometimes cause Tiffany to walk into door frames.|$|R

5|$|After {{serving in}} office for an extra year to 1905, Clarke retired, having helped to create a better system {{for the benefit of}} all. While the Colonial Office sought to mediate {{conflicts}} of interest, its impact was varied due to its desire to avoid expense. Milner was preoccupied with his vision of a new South Africa incorporating Southern Rhodesia, for which he needed the support of the BSAC. He appears to have had respect for Clarke, although he seems to have resented his influence at the Colonial Office, denying him an increase in salary or an official secretary. On Clarke's retirement, Milner wrote 'Personally I hardly <b>think</b> <b>the</b> office of Resident Commissioner any longer necessary'.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rift}} between {{the players and}} Brown and between Modell and Brown grew, Modell fired Brown on January 7, 1963. A {{controversy}} developed over {{the timing of the}} decision amid a local newspaper strike, which limited discussion of the move. A printing company executive, however, got together a group of sportswriters and published a 32-page magazine fielding players' views on the firing. Opinions were mixed; Modell came in for his share of criticism, but tackle and team captain Mike McCormack said he did not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> team could win under Brown. Blanton Collier, Brown's longtime assistant, was named the team's new head coach, and Brown began to plan his next move as he continued to receive an $82,500 salary under his eight-year contract.|$|E

Megan meets Linda's parents, Al (Barry Shabaka Henley) and Laura (Brenda Pressley), and tells them the news, leaving them devastated.

Brian has started to abuse Nina, so the police get Nina away from Brian, as he caused Linda to suffer from bulimia due to the abuse.|$|E
