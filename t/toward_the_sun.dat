5|$|Along {{with the}} {{asteroid}} bodies, {{the asteroid belt}} also contains bands of dust with particle radii of up to a few hundred micrometres. This fine material is produced, at least in part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids. Due to the Poynting–Robertson effect, the pressure of solar radiation causes this dust to slowly spiral inward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b>|$|E
5|$|In modern times, Earth's {{perihelion}} occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates {{change over}} time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> {{at about the same}} time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|Based {{on their}} orbital characteristics, short-period comets {{are thought to}} {{originate}} from the centaurs and the Kuiper belt/scattered disc —a disk of objects in the trans-Neptunian region—whereas the source of long-period comets {{is thought to be}} the far more distant spherical Oort cloud (after the Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort who hypothesised its existence). Vast swarms of comet-like bodies are thought to orbit the Sun in these distant regions in roughly circular orbits. Occasionally the gravitational influence of the outer planets (in the case of Kuiper belt objects) or nearby stars (in the case of Oort cloud objects) may throw one of these bodies into an elliptical orbit that takes it inwards <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> to form a visible comet. Unlike the return of periodic comets, whose orbits have been established by previous observations, the appearance of new comets by this mechanism is unpredictable.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{perihelion}} {{occurs during}} {{the southern hemisphere}}'s summer. This means that solar radiation due to (1) axial tilt aiming the southern hemisphere <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and (2) the Earth's proximity to the Sun, both reach maximum {{during the summer and}} both reach minimum during the winter. Their effects on heating are additive, which means that seasonal variation in irradiation of the southern hemisphere is more extreme. In the northern hemisphere, these two factors reach maximum at opposite times of the year: The north is tilted <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> when the Earth is furthest from the Sun. The two forces work in opposite directions, resulting in less extreme variation.|$|E
25|$|Response to stimuli: a {{response}} {{can take many}} forms, from the contraction of a unicellular organism to external chemicals, to complex reactions involving all the senses of multicellular organisms.

25|$|In about 13,000 years, {{the north}} pole will be tilted <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> when the Earth is at perihelion. Axial tilt and orbital {{eccentricity}} will both contribute their maximum increase in solar radiation during the northern hemisphere's summer. Axial precession will promote more extreme variation in irradiation of the northern hemisphere and less extreme variation in the south.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{shift of}} American economic activity <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> Belt {{during the latter}} part of the 20th century, and an increasingly globalized economy have also contributed to the decline in power held by Northeastern WASPs. While WASPs are no longer solitary among the American elite, members of the Patrician class remain markedly prevalent within the current power structure.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of an orbit, the {{obliquity}} usually does not change considerably, and the orientation of the axis remains the same relative to the background stars. This causes one pole to be directed more <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> {{on one side of the}} orbit, and the other pole on the other side — the cause of the seasons on the Earth.|$|E

Some eyewitnesses believed that the Air Wisconsin Twin Otter began a turn seconds before the collision, but the NTSB did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that the Air Wisconsin crew took evasive action. The rate of closure during the final five seconds before the collision was 688 feet (210 m) per second, i.e., 469mph (755km/hr).|$|E
25|$|Earth's axis remains tilted in {{the same}} {{direction}} with reference to the background stars throughout a year (regardless of where it is in its orbit). This means that one pole (and the associated hemisphere of Earth) will be directed away from the Sun at one side of the orbit, and half an orbit later (half a year later) this pole will be directed towards the Sun. This is the cause of Earth's seasons. Summer occurs in the Northern hemisphere when the north pole is directed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> Variations in Earth's axial tilt can influence the seasons and is likely a factor in long-term climate change (also see Milankovitch cycles).|$|E
25|$|At noon on {{the longest}} day {{the plane of}} {{longitude}} passing through Marseilles is exactly on edge to the sun. If the Earth's axis were not tilted <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun,</b> a vertical rod at the equator would have no shadow. Arod further north would have a north-south shadow, and as an elevation of 90° would be a zero latitude, the complement of the elevation gives the latitude. The sun is even higher in the sky due to the tilt. The angle added to the elevation by the tilt {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic and at that time was 23°44′40″. The complement of the elevation less the obliquity is 43°13′, only 5′ in error from Marseilles's latitude, 43°18′.|$|E

25|$|Expert ESA {{personnel}} were immediately dispatched from Europe to the United States to direct operations. Days passed without contact from SOHO. On July 23, the Arecibo Observatory and Goldstone Solar System Radar combined to locate SOHO with radar, {{and to determine}} its location and attitude. SOHO was close to its predicted position, oriented with its side versus the usual front Optical Surface Reflector panel pointing <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> and was rotating at one revolutions every 53 seconds. Once SOHO was located, plans for contacting SOHO were formed. On August 3 a carrier was detected from SOHO, the first signal since June 25. After days of charging the battery, a successful {{attempt was made to}} modulate the carrier and downlink telemetry on August 8. After instrument temperatures were downlinked on August 9, data analysis was performed, and planning for the SOHO recovery began in earnest.|$|E
25|$|Size is not {{the only}} factor in making red dwarfs {{potentially}} unsuitable for life, however. On a red dwarf planet, photosynthesis on the night side would be impossible, since it would never see the sun. On the day side, because the sun does not rise or set, areas in the shadows of mountains would remain so forever. Photosynthesis as we understand it would be {{complicated by the fact that}} a red dwarf produces most of its radiation in the infrared, and on the Earth the process depends on visible light. There are potential positives to this scenario. Numerous terrestrial ecosystems rely on chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis, for instance, which would be possible in a red dwarf system. A static primary star position removes the need for plants to steer leaves <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun,</b> deal with changing shade/sun patterns, or change from photosynthesis to stored energy during night. Because of the lack of a day-night cycle, including the weak light of morning and evening, far more energy would be available at a given radiation level.|$|E
25|$|The first {{modifications}} to the Nice model were the initial positions of the giant planets. Investigations {{of the behavior of}} planets orbiting in a gas disk using hydrodynamical models reveal that the giant planets would migrate <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> If the migration continued it would have resulted in Jupiter orbiting close to the Sun like recently discovered exoplanets known as hot Jupiters. Saturn's capture in a resonance with Jupiter prevents this, however, and the later capture of the other planets results in a quadruple resonant configuration with Jupiter and Saturn in their 3:2 resonance. A late instability beginning from this configuration is possible if the outer disk contains Pluto-massed objects. The gravitational stirring of the outer planetesimal disk by these Pluto-massed objects increases their eccentricities and also results in the inward migration of the giant planets. The quadruple resonance of the giant planets is broken when secular resonances are crossed during the inward migration. A late instability similar to the original Nice model then follows. Unlike the original Nice model the timing of this instability is not sensitive to the distance between the outer planet and the planetesimal disk. The combination of resonant planetary orbits and the late instability triggered by these long distant interactions has been referred to as the Nice 2 model.|$|E

500|$|The radial {{velocity}} {{of a star}} is its motion toward or away from the Sun. Unlike proper motion, a star's {{radial velocity}} cannot be directly observed, but must be determined through measurement of the spectrum. Due to the Doppler shift, the absorption lines in the spectrum of a star will be shifted slightly toward the red (or longer wavelengths) if the star is {{moving away from the}} observer, or toward blue (or shorter wavelengths) when it moves toward the observer. In the case of Tau Ceti, the radial velocity is about −17km/s, with the negative value indicating that it is moving <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> The star will make its closest approach to the Sun in about 43,000years when it comes to within [...]|$|E
