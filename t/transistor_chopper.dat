5000|$|On November 29, 1963 Dr. Biard, Gary Pittman, Edward L. Bonin, and Jack Kilby filed {{a patent}} titled [...] "Photosensitive <b>Transistor</b> <b>Chopper</b> Using Light Emissive Diode" [...] (U.S. Patent US3304431); the first optical isolator. Within the patent they {{described}} a phototransistor chopper consisting of an LED optically {{coupled with a}} dual emitter, photosensitive, silicon transistor. The arrangement provided a switching function in which the switch was completely electrically isolated from the LED that drove it. The transistor operated in response to light emitted from the LED when forward current bias was generated across the junction of the diode. When emitted light struck {{the surface of the}} transistor, it was absorbed in the regions of both the emitter-base and base-collector junctions causing the transistor to conduct. This photoconductive transistor could be rapidly turned on and off by intensity modulating the LED at a very high frequency using high frequency alternating voltage. Prior to their invention, complete electrical isolation of the switch element in a chopper from the driving source for opening and closing the switch element was not possible, even through use of isolation transformers. Using isolation transformers, which were bulky and expensive, in miniaturized circuits to separate the driving source and the switch element resulted in magnetic pick-up and spike feed-through due to the transformer winding capacitance. Optical isolators were ideal because they're very small and can be mounted to a circuit board. In addition, they offer protection against excessively high voltages, reduce noise levels, and make measurements more accurate. In March 1965, Texas Instruments announced the SNX1304 Optoelectronic Pulse Amplifier, which was conceived and developed by Dr. Biard and Jerry Merryman, the inventor of the first handheld digital calculator. The SNX1304 consisted of a GaAs p-n junction light emitter optically coupled to an integrated silicon photodetector feedback-amplifier circuit. The device is thought to be the first commercial optically coupled integrated circuit.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} Automated Mixed Traffic Vehicle (AMTV) {{speed control}} system employing a microprocessor and <b>transistor</b> <b>chopper</b> motor current controller is described and its performance {{is presented in}} terms of velocity versus time curves. The on board computer hardware and software systems are described as is the software development system. All of the programming used in this controller was implemented using FORTRAN. This microprocessor controller made possible a number of safety features and improved the comfort associated with starting and shopping. In addition, most of the vehicle's performance characteristics can be altered by simple program parameter changes. A failure analysis of the microprocessor controller was generated {{and the results are}} included. Flow diagrams for the speed control algorithms and complete FORTRAN code listings are also included...|$|E
40|$|The {{power supply}} of the shift bump magnet (BUHS) [1] [2] is {{composed}} of the assemblies that are multiple-connection with IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar <b>Transistor)</b> <b>choppers.</b> The switching frequency of them is controlled over 48 kHz. The high-frequency noise due to the switching of the IGBT choppers has caused the damages to the control system. Furthermore, the capacitors for the RF shield of the ceramics chamber inside the BUHS have been burned by the induced voltage due to the fast falling time of the current pattern and the current ripple of the high frequency. The ground wires that connect to each power supply panel and each magnet has been changed to copper sheets and the neutral ground (ME) resistor of the IGBT assemblies have been installed. So that the voltage due to the switching noise has been decreased from 900 V to 24 V. The Low-pass filter of 72 kHz has been installed to output circuit and the falling time of the current pattern was changed to be slow. The burning of the capacitor was controlled...|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} had six DC traction motors. The main {{armature current}} {{for all the}} motors is fed from a common thyristor drive, whilst each motor has an independent field current controller. The field current controllers comprised a two quadrant chopper inside a thyristor bridge. The bipolar <b>transistor</b> based <b>choppers</b> provides a fast fine control of motor torque for electric braking and slip control, whilst the thyristor bridge is used to invert the field current polarity.|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} the design, development, and {{validation}} of advanced prototype 2 MVA generation equipment [i. e., naval package (NP) ] for a shipboard medium-voltage dc integrated power system (MVDC IPS). The generation equipment {{is based on an}} ultrahigh-speed 22, 500 -r/min 12 -phase alternator, which feeds an ac/dc power electronics converter comprising four diode rectifiers and four insulated-gate bipolar <b>transistor</b> (IGBT) <b>choppers.</b> The prototype realization constitutes a follow-up of a previous NP version employing a wound-field 6, 300 -r/min alternator feeding noncontrolled ac/dc converters. The major technical challenges faced in the design and development of the advanced NP prototype are outlined in this article, taking the previous lower-speed version as a technology reference.

40|$|Being the workhorse, {{induction}} motors {{are serving}} the industry. Mostly {{we can see}} squirrel cage motors, but when it's come to the large industries, wound rotor induction motors are also there. Applications like Mills, Large Fans, Pumps, Blowers, Crushers and Overhead Cranes which require higher starting torques use wound rotor induction motors {{to have a higher}} starting torque at a lower starting current at the stator. Generally wound rotor induction motors require more maintenance than squirrel cage motors because of its rotor construction, slip ring assembly and the starting method used. Conventionally, wound rotor motors use an external resistor bank, which is connected to the rotor winding via slip rings, and external rotor resistance varies from a maximum value to zero as the rotor speed develops. Varying the external resistance can be achieved by several electromechanical methods. This is done in a stepwise manner with a motorized camshaft with electromechanical contact points or with a set of electrical power contactors and timers having a suitable time delay between adjacent steps. The traditional starter is highly mechanical and can cause lot of startup delays and is bulkier and requires frequent maintenance. To ensure right operation of rotor resistance control, the motor control circuit incorporates several additional measures and these are too prone to failures due to their own nature. Due to high heat dissipation in the resistors the number of consecutive startups during a short time period is also limited. The proposed power electronic starter is entirely a power electronic device, which is having a three-phase rectifier bridge and a programmable <b>transistor</b> <b>chopper.</b> Programmable <b>transistor</b> <b>chopper</b> ensures a gradual speed development at rotor and control the acceleration with the duty factor of the transistor. This could eliminate the major disadvantage of traditional starter, which is the dependability of rotor speed with the load torque by extending it to have a closed loop speed control. Thereby we can ensure the programmable torque-speed characteristics with this power electronic starter. This power electronic development will minimize the overall maintenance, and avoid current fluctuations completely during speed changes while demanding speed up or down at the rotor. This report discusses the proposal, simulations in prone to the construction, hardware design and practical implementation and testing of starter with a no load wound rotor motor. Latter part of the report shows the performances of new starter over the conventional starter and future developments possible...|$|E
40|$|The battery {{electric}} vehicle {{is presented as a}} pollution free alternative to the internal combustion engined vehicle as a form of commuter transport in city centres. To conserve battery energy as much as possible, an efficient drive system, consisting of a chopper controller and a permanent magnet motor, is described and tested in four modes of operation - two modes of motoring and two of regenerative braking. From the experimental results, it was estimated that approximately 10 % of the energy expended by the vehicle during motoring could be returned to the battery if regenerative braking is employed under stop-start driving conditions. The operation of <b>transistor</b> and thyristor <b>choppers</b> is described, and their suitability for use in a vehicle drive system is discussed. A proposed vehicle control system, incorporating a thyristor array and associated logic for implementing the mode selection, is described and evaluated...|$|R
