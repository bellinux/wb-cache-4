5|$|Culverhouse was {{described}} as late as 1982 as a rare owner who was popular with players, coaches, and fans. He was commended for allowing his staff to handle football operations without interference, and for having <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>to</b> allow John McKay {{to follow through with}} his building plan despite the franchise's 0–26 start. This changed after events surrounding the 1982 players' strike. A report issued by the National Football League Players Association {{prior to the start of}} negotiations revealed that the Buccaneers had the fifth-highest gross income of all NFL teams, while their average salary was only the 21st-highest. This directly contradicted statements made by Culverhouse in 1980, in which he told players that they were on one of the three highest-paid teams. The NFLPA figures showed that the Buccaneers were actually the third lowest-paying team, based on total salaries as a percentage of gross income. Culverhouse was then accused of trying to divide the players during the strike, when some of the team's assistant coaches contacted players to ask whether they would be willing to return to the team should training facilities be reopened.|$|E

25|$|In August 1609, John Smith {{was quite}} {{surprised}} to see more than 300 new settlers arrive, which did not go well for him. London was sending new settlers with no real planning or logistical support. Then in May 1610, Somers and Gates finally arrived with 150 people from the Sea Venture. (Bermuda, or the 'Somers Isles', had remained settled since 1609, and the Virginia Company's possession was made official in 1612 when it was added to Virginia's territory.) Gates soon {{found that there was}} not enough food to support all in the colony and decided to abandon Jamestown. As their boats were leaving the Jamestown area, they met a ship carrying the new governor, Lord De la Warr, who ordered them back to Jamestown. Somers returned to Bermuda with <b>the</b> <b>Patience</b> <b>to</b> gather more food for Jamestown but died there. The Patience, captained by his nephew, then sailed for England instead of Virginia.|$|E

500|$|The game's mission {{design and}} {{progression}} system received mixed reviews. According to Parkin, the chaos system {{did not make}} sense; Rico sometimes destroys properties which help local citizens. He called most missions repetitive and a [...] "grind", losing their appeal as players progress (although he praised some side missions). Parkin and VanOrd criticized the stronghold-takeover missions. Parkin added that most players {{probably would not have}} <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>to</b> complete the settlements, since the island's appeal wanes after hours of play. Marchiafava praised the game's side activities, saying that the diversions increased its replayability. Davis criticized the missions' repetition, but liked their quantity.|$|E
500|$|Hogg and {{her younger}} {{brothers}} were rambunctious. She recalled that they particularly enjoyed sliding down the banisters in the Governor's Mansion. Hogg's parents allowed this to continue until Thomas cut his chin, after which Jim Hogg nailed tacks along {{the center of the}} railing to curb the activity through fear of bloodied posteriors; the holes from the tacks remained visible in the banister for many decades after the Hogg family moved from the home. Hogg's mother attempted to teach her ladylike skills such as needlework, but Hogg claimed that she [...] "never had <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>to</b> succeed". Her mother also encouraged Hogg to learn German. Hogg and her siblings were frequently taken to the Millet Opera House in Austin to enjoy the performances.|$|E

He cited surrealist films Eraserhead and Un Chien Andalou (as mentioned in [...] "Debaser") as major influences on his work with the Pixies; however, surrealism was less of an influence in his solo career. He commented on these influences (which he paid tribute to most in the Pixies' Doolittle), saying he [...] "didn't have <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>to</b> sit around reading Surrealist novels", but found it easier to watch 20-minute films.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers also {{praised the}} game's varied {{scenarios}} and replayability. Dora from Jay Is Games praised the game, saying that [...] "with {{a huge amount}} of replay value, creativity to burn, and some of the most shocking plot lines you could ever hope to encounter, Hatoful Boyfriend is a fascinating and surprising text adventure well worth checking out", though she also observes that [...] "the delayed payoff and the abruptness of some of the endings combined with the oddball concept may not appeal to every fan of the visual novel genre". Alexa Ray Corriea's Polygon review of the remake gave it an 8 out of 10, concluding that the [...] "witty dialogue and absolutely bonkers scenarios are genuinely fun to discover, and the handful of different storylines make repeated playthroughs worthwhile". Some critics however expressed concerns over the presence of some repetitive aspects of gameplay—noted as being especially apparent when attempting multiple playthroughs—as well as the accessibility of the game's Bad Boys Love scenario to casual players: in his review of the remake for PC Gamer, Julian Murdoch states that [...] "I suspect few will have <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>to</b> ride the fast forward button and suss out the romantic proclivities of each cast member to get to the extended ending—really a second half—of the game".|$|E

2500|$|The {{length of}} The Velvet Rope drew {{criticism}} from certain music critics. In a less enthusiastic mixed review, AllMusic observed a [...] "hardened, sexually experimental Janet"; however, its writer claimed that [...] "the best moments {{sink into the}} murk", and that [...] "there are good moments on The Velvet Rope, but at its running time [...] it's hard to work up <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>to</b> find them". In a retrospective review, BBC Music stated that [...] "t's far too long. It does feel like you've given over a considerable chunk of your life to it by its end, an unfortunate by-product of the CD era with its overriding desire to fill up every last second of each disc". However, a positive review of the record was given on the whole, with its author calling it [...] "ature and experimental... Possibly the great lost 90s trip hop album".|$|E
2500|$|As the 1990s wore on, {{interest}} in the Expos dwindled {{to the point that}} they were barely part of Montreal's sports landscape.

[...] When he took a taxi to a game at Olympic Stadium, the driver couldn't find the entrance, and there were no signs anywhere touting games. [...] According to Alou's friend, with such lackluster marketing, it was no surprise that the Expos couldn't attract any fans.

[...] All of this is to say that the Christian must have <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>to</b> get through tough times. To him, the ultimate display of courage is through the martyr, who is “required to patiently persevere, since they have the confidence that enduring wrong is the gift of charity." [...] The philosopher also highlighted that true courage is a gift of the Holy Spirit when he said that “courage is a gift of the Spirit that protects the martyr from the ‘dread of danger.’" [...] The martyr is the best example because they believe that “God will complete God’s work in [...] even if [...] lives are taken by [...] enemies."

2500|$|They {{arrived there}} {{only to find}} the colony's {{population}} almost annihilated by the Starving Time, which had left only 60 survivors out of the 500 who had preceded them, and most of these survivors were sick or dying. The food the Sea Venture survivors brought with them was woefully insufficient, and the colony seemed unviable. It was decided to abandon it, and to return everyone to England. Loaded aboard the two ships, they were prevented from making this evacuation by the timely arrival of another relief fleet, bearing Governor Lord De La Warre, among others. The Sea Venture survivors had brought pork from the pigs that had been found wild on the island, which had presumably been left by previous visitors. This led the Jamestown colonists to refer to [...] "Bermuda Hogs" [...] as a form of currency. Somers returned to Bermuda with <b>the</b> <b>Patience</b> <b>to</b> obtain more food supplies, but died there from a surfeit of pork. The Patience, captained by his nephew, Matthew Somers, returned to England, instead of Virginia. Somers left three volunteers – Carter, Chard and Waters – behind on Bermuda (two when the Deliverance and Patience had departed, and the third following the Patience's return) to maintain the claim of the island for the English, leaving the Virginia Company in possession of the island. As a result, Bermuda has been continuously inhabited since the wrecking of the Sea Venture, and claims its origin from that date, and not the official settlement of 1612.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{scores are}} average, mixed or negative: The Scotsman {{gave it a}} score of three stars out of five and said that it [...] "employs stillness as a set-up for all manner of disruption: sharply pealing riffs, phantasmagorical metaphors, {{convoluted}} song structures. In many ways it's a typical effort from the guitarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and the vocalist Cedric Bixler-Zavala, {{who make up the}} Mars Volta's core. But that's not to discredit the more measured side of Octahedron. Presented as an eight-song suite, the album delivers a panoramic range of intensity, sliding along that range in ways both gradual and startling." [...] BBC Music gave it an average review and said that the album [...] "shows the band maintaining a frighteningly productive work rate... while continuing to mature. [...] Its vaulting ambition demands over-inflated self-confidence. And MV have that in spades." [...] Uncut also gave it a score of three stars out of five and said, [...] "As ever with The Mars Volta, there are enough flashes of brilliance {{to make up for the}} wearying material elsewhere." [...] Q likewise gave the album three stars out of five and said it [...] "bucks the band's trend for obfuscation, though; conventional song structures are very much in evidence, while its relatively trim 49-minute running time is on par with some of Mars Volta's more involved live jams." [...] Alternative Press likewise gave it three stars and said the album [...] "will appeal to elderly prog fans immune to attention deficit disorder, who have <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>to</b> let its charm gradually unfold." ...|$|E
