[...] "As some of you now know, I have learned in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> that I have lung cancer," [...] he said.

500|$|Mephedrone {{is one of}} {{hundreds}} of designer drugs or legal highs that have been reported in recent years, including artificial chemicals such as synthetic cannabis and semisynthetic substances such as methylhexanamine. These drugs are primarily developed to avoid being controlled by laws against illegal drugs, thus giving them the label of designer drugs. According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the synthesis of mephedrone was first reported in 1929 by Saem de Burnaga Sanchez in the Bulletin de la Société Chimique de France, under the name [...] "toluyl-alpha-monomethylaminoethylcetone", but the compound remained an obscure product of academia until 2003, when it was [...] "re-discovered" [...] and publicised by an underground chemist on The Hive website, working under the pseudonym [...] "Kinetic". Kinetic posted on the site, [...] "I’ve been bored over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> and had a few fun reagents lying around, so I thought I’d try and make some 1-(4-methylphenyl)-2-methylaminopropanone hydrochloride, or 4-methylmethcathinone." [...] before going on to describe that after taking it, the user had a [...] "fantastic sense of well-being that I haven’t got from any drug before except my beloved Ecstasy." [...] In interviews Kinetic was described as [...] "a mathematician who used to design sleeping pills for a major pharmaceutical company" [...] and he stated that he was based in Israel when he rediscovered mephedrone.|$|E
