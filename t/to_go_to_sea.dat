5|$|For the {{invasion}} of Normandy Belfast was made headquarters ship of Bombardment Force E flying the flag of Rear-Admiral Frederick Dalrymple-Hamilton, and was to support landings by British and Canadian forces in the Gold and Juno Beach sectors. On 2 June Belfast left the River Clyde for her bombardment areas. That morning Prime Minister Winston Churchill had announced his intention <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> with the fleet and witness {{the invasion}} from HMS Belfast. This was opposed by the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, and the First Sea Lord, Sir Andrew Cunningham. An intervention by the King eventually prevented Churchill from going.|$|E
5|$|As marine {{creatures that}} reside {{in either the}} depths or the poles, humans {{knew very little about}} whales over the course of history; many feared or revered them. The Nords and various arctic tribes revered the whale as they were {{important}} pieces of their lives. In Inuit creation myths, when 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the Great Spirit where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus, return order to the world. In an Icelandic legend, a man threw a stone at a fin whale and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. The man was told not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> for twenty years, but during the nineteenth year he went fishing and a whale came and killed him.|$|E
5|$|Jaime I {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval {{shipyard}} in Ferrol on 5 February 1912. She was launched on 21 September 1914, {{less than two months}} after the start of World War I. Spain remained neutral during the conflict, but because Britain supplied much of the armament and other building materials, work on Jaime I was considerably delayed. The ship was ready <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> by 1917, but she was not completed until well {{after the end of the}} war; work was finally finished on 20 December 1921. Upon her completion, she joined her two sister ships in the 1st Squadron of the Spanish fleet. Jaime I saw action against insurgents in Morocco in the Rif War during the early 1920s along with her two sisters. Rif insurgents operating a coastal battery damaged the ship in 1924.|$|E

5|$|The script {{called for}} the probe to {{vaporize}} the Earth's oceans, generating heavy cloud cover. While effects cinematographer Don Dow wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> and record plumes of water created by exploding detonating cords in the water, the team decided to create the probe's climatic effect in another way after a government fishing agency voiced concerns {{for the welfare of}} marine life in the area. The team used a combination of baking soda and cloud tank effects; the swirling mist created by the water-filled tank was shot on black velvet, and color and dynamic swirls were added by injecting paint into the tank. These shots were composited onto a painting of the Earth along with overlaid lightning effects, created by double-exposing lights as they moved across the screen.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh {{was born}} in Tirhut, India, on 1 July 1879, one of six {{children}} (five sons and a daughter) of a Scottish indigo planter, Alexander Mackintosh, a descendant from the chieftains of Clan Chattan. Aeneas would in due course be named as an heir to the chieftainship, and to the ancient seat at Inverness that went with it. When Aeneas was still a young child, his mother, Annie Mackintosh, suddenly returned to Britain, bringing the children with her. The reasons for the family rift are unknown, but it was evidently permanent. At home in Bedfordshire, Aeneas attended Bedford Modern School. He then followed the same path as had Ernest Shackleton five years earlier, leaving school {{at the age of}} 16 <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea.</b> After serving a tough Merchant Officer's apprenticeship, he joined the P and O Line, and remained with this company until he was recruited by Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition, which sailed for Antarctica in 1907. Before the expedition's departure Mackintosh was commissioned Sub-Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve.|$|E
5|$|When news reached Bonaparte that Ganteaume had {{returned}} to Toulon for a second time, he once again issued orders for the admiral <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> and fulfill his original orders to resupply the Egyptian garrison. On 27 April, the French force sailed for the third time, with seven ships of the line, two frigates, a corvette and two storeships. Before sailing to Egypt Ganteaume first cruised off Elba in the Ligurian Sea, achieving regional superiority long enough that a force was able to cross to the island from Piombino, rapidly subduing all but the fortress of Porto Ferrajo, which was besieged. Ganteaume's ships bombarded the fortress on 6 May, but an outbreak of typhus in the squadron significantly reduced its operational effectiveness. Ganteaume therefore divided his force, taking four ships with healthy crews south, while Formidable, Indomptable and Desaix, and the frigate Créole were all too undermanned to perform efficiently, and were sent back to Toulon. Having reorganised his force, Ganteaume passed through the Straits of Messina on 25 May. On 5 June off Brindisi, the squadron sighted and chased the British frigate HMS Pique under Captain James Young, which was able to effect an escape to Alexandria and warn Keith of Ganteaume's approach. A planned rendezvous off Brindisi with three Neapolitan frigates did not occur, and by 7 June the squadron {{was close enough to}} Egypt for Ganteaume to send his corvette Héliopolis to investigate the situation at Alexandria.|$|E

5|$|Mallory's {{first major}} speech in Congress {{was in favor}} of a return to flogging, which he argued was needed in order that a captain would be able to control his seamen in battle. His {{position}} was unpopular throughout the nation, and Congress refused to lift the ban. His views on flogging, for good or ill, were forgotten when he turned his energies to the second of President Fillmore's proposals, that of reforming the officer corps of the Navy. He was by this time chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and the law that Congress passed was recognized as coming from his hand. It established a Retirement Board of senior naval officers, who examined the qualifications of all other commissioned officers. Those who were deemed incapable or unworthy of their rank were placed on a retired list, the first compulsory retirement {{in the history of the}} U.S. Navy. By most accounts, the board did its work creditably, but many of the officers who were adversely affected did not agree. Among those who were forced into early retirement was Matthew Fontaine Maury, too crippled <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea,</b> but whose study of ocean currents formed the basis for the new science of oceanography. Maury and some of the other retirees enlisted other Senators to support their cases, and the debate was renewed. In the end, however, Mallory's views prevailed, a testimonial to his parliamentary skills. The enmity between Maury and Mallory lasted the remainder of their lives and distorted their performance in the Civil War, when both men sided with the South.|$|E

25|$|Because {{of their}} large size, king penguin chicks take 14–16 months {{before they are}} ready <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea.</b> This is {{markedly}} different from smaller penguins, who rear their chicks through a single summer when food is plentiful. King penguins time their mating so the chicks will develop over the harshest season for fishing.

As much as he loves Sophia, Aubrey is ready <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sea</b> again. Stephen Maturin comes to call, and soon after Aubrey's orders are delivered from the port Admiral. He is given command of the 38-gun frigate HMS Boadicea. At Plymouth, he picks up orders and Mr R T Farquhar, a political gentleman. He is to sail to the station at Cape Town where the ships of a convoy will meet. Not long away from home, they meet with the French ship Hébé which is escorting a captured merchant ship. The Boadicea captures both ships. He sends the prizes to Gibraltar. The timely capture allows the ship to send letters home, gain a French cook and the Hébé's English prisoners, able seamen. The long journey in the Atlantic gives Aubrey time to bring {{the crew of the}} Boadicea up to his standards of efficiency in gunnery, and gives Maturin and Farquhar time to develop strategies.|$|E
