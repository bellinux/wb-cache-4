5|$|In {{addition}} to a showcase for visual improvements, Lost Coast acted as a testbed for Valve's commentary system. When the feature is enabled, additional items appear in the game that can be interacted with to play an audio commentary. Each audio piece ranges from ten seconds to a minute of commentary. Players hear the developers <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> the player is seeing, what is happening, why they made certain decisions, {{and what kinds of}} challenges they faced. Commentary tracks are represented by floating speech bubbles called commentary nodes. Valve intended for players to first play the level with commentary disabled, and after completing the level, play it again with commentary enabled, learning about each new stage as they progress. The company has since made the commentary system standard in all of its later video games.|$|E

25|$|Each episode {{follows the}} same pattern: Rodge, the dumber of the two, arrives home. Originally the pair {{would get into}} bed but in recent seasons they sit at the kitchen table. They <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> Rodge was doing, with Podge usually {{insulting}} him. This leads Podge on to telling a story (acted out by live actors) about some people (whose names are usually sexual innuendos, e.g. Enda Meshank, Chris Peacock, Ulick McGee) who inevitably come to an unpleasant end. Rodge interrupts the story with stupid comments and/or reference to masturbation. It ends with Podge punishing Rodge for no reason.|$|E

25|$|Duel Live {{made use}} of the {{original}} outdoor queue line, often with other actors roaming the wooded area. For the 2008 version, the queue featured gravediggers and werewolves creeping up on the guests, though in 2009 this was reduced to one actor in a hooded robe. Guests waited at the door instead of walking straight in, before being greeted by either a maid or a butler (the performers alternated during the 2009 version, but in 2008 only the butler featured) and given a brief <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> was inside and why the guns were switched off. The TV screens in the Drawing Room were covered with cloth and muted, and the original spooky music turned up; the room being similar {{to what it was}} in the original Haunted House. During the 2008 event, the maid jumped out at guests as they entered the Drawing Room.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{attempts}} {{often have}} revolved {{around trying to}} discover what traumatic event had caused the amnesia, and drugs such as intravenously administered barbiturates (often thought of as 'truth serum') were popular as treatment for psychogenic amnesia during World War II; benzodiazepines may have been substituted later. 'Truth serum' drugs were thought to work by making a painful memory more tolerable when expressed through relieving the strength of an emotion attached to a memory. Under the influence of these 'truth' drugs the patient would more readily <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> had occurred to them. However, information elicited from patients {{under the influence of}} drugs such as barbiturates would be a mixture of truth and fantasy, and was thus not regarded as scientific in gathering accurate evidence for past events. Often treatment was aimed at treating the patient as a whole, and probably varied in practice in different places. Hypnosis was also popular as a means for gaining information from people about their past experiences, but like 'truth' drugs really only served to lower the threshold of suggestibility so that the patient would speak easily but not necessarily truthfully. If no motive for the amnesia was immediately apparent, deeper motives were usually sought by questioning the patient more intensely, often in conjunction with hypnosis and 'truth' drugs. In many cases, however, patients were found to spontaneously recover from their amnesia on their own accord so no treatment was required.|$|E
500|$|Sue Walsh {{observed}} in 2007 that critics have rigidly categorised Just So Stories as [...] "Children's Literature", and have in consequence given it scant literary attention. In her view, if critics mention {{the book at}} all, they <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> kind of reading is good for children {{and what they are}} capable of understanding. The stories are discussed, she argues, by critics such as Elliott Gose [...] "in terms of ideas about the child’s pleasure (conceived of in sensual terms divorced of intellectual understanding) in the oral aspects of the text which are said to prompt an ‘active Participation’ which seems largely to be understood in terms of the ‘oral savouring’ of repetition".|$|E

500|$|... "A Little Bit" [...] is a dance-pop song, {{composed}} in a [...] "medium pop" [...] tempo. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, {{it is written}} in the key of E minor. Its beat is set in common time, and moves at a tempo of 94 beats per minute. It also has the sequence of Em–C–B/D as its chord progression. Simpson's voice in the song spans from the note of G3 to the high note of D5. Following the same beat-oriented pattern as [...] "Irresistible", [...] "A Little Bit" [...] features piano instrumentation. Simpson sings the lyrics as rapid-fire verses and with start-and-stop hooks. Simpson adopts breathy vocals for the song, and the lyrics <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> she expects from her partner: [...] "A little more time, a little less wait / A little more heart, a little less break". She also demands healthy changes in the relationship.|$|E
500|$|The reviews {{have stood}} the test of time and the season still remains a huge {{critical}} favorite. Entertainment Weekly reviewing the tenth season of the show acknowledged that, [...] "the second season is still the show’s best season to date."

[...] calling in all the signature elements of the show that it did the best with listing all the best moments from the season, [...] "the elevator", [...] "the walkway", [...] "Joe’s bar, [...] " [...] Meredith’s [...] "Pick me" [...] speech". and the [...] "memorable patients" [...] adding, [...] " [...] I want two people stuck on a pole (Into You Like a Train) or two Amish best friends having to say goodbye, and I want those stories to be given ample time to resonate.

[...] VanDerWerff also wrote in his review, [...] ""Blood of My Blood" [...] is another exciting hour of television, even if it's a bit more piece move-y than, say, [...] "The Door". The revelations are milder, the characters mostly <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they're going to do next, and the stories go from Point A to Point B, instead of Point X, Y, or Z. But there's still plenty going on that's worth checking out." [...] Comparing the episode to [...] "Book of the Stranger", Jeremy Egner of The New York Times said, [...] "The problem with emerging naked from a flaming temple is that it's hard to top.

500|$|Two {{young female}} millworkers in 1873 Maine visit the town's {{carousel}} after work. One of them, Julie Jordan, attracts {{the attention of}} the barker, Billy Bigelow ("The Carousel Waltz"). [...] When Julie lets Billy {{put his arm around her}} during the ride, Mrs. Mullin, the widowed owner of the carousel, tells Julie never to return. Julie and her friend, Carrie Pipperidge, argue with Mrs. Mullin. [...] Billy arrives and, seeing that Mrs. Mullin is jealous, mocks her; he is fired from his job. Billy, unconcerned, invites Julie to join him for a drink. As he goes to get his belongings, Carrie presses Julie about her feelings toward him, but Julie is evasive ("You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan"). Carrie has a beau too, fisherman Enoch Snow ("(When I Marry) Mister Snow"), to whom she is newly engaged. [...] Billy returns for Julie as the departing Carrie warns that staying out late means the loss of Julie's job. Mr. Bascombe, owner of the mill, happens by along with a policeman, and offers to escort Julie to her home, but she refuses and is fired.

500|$|During the 90s, new manga author Masashi Kishimoto {{sought to}} write a {{one-shot}} chapter that would feature Naruto as a chef, but this version {{never made it to}} print. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of Naruto for the summer 1997 issue of Akamaru Jump magazine based on the idea. For the serialized version, Kishimoto incorporated traits he felt made an ideal hero in the creation of Naruto: a straightforward way of thinking, a mischievous side, and attributes possessed by Goku from the Dragon Ball franchise. Aiming to keep Naruto [...] "simple and stupid", Kishimoto avoided modeling him after anyone in particular, instead conceiving of him as naïve with a dark side resulting from his harsh past. Despite this, he is always optimistic, a trait Kishimoto said makes this character unique. By and large, Naruto's personality is childish; the creator tried to convey this trait in his illustrations. Kishimoto notes as an example of this the cover of volume 10, where Kishimoto depicts Naruto mimicking a turtle as a child might do. Naruto was Kishimoto's first published manga, and he focused on making Naruto's facial expressions consistent in difficult situations. He commented: [...] "It's rather awkward to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> makes Naruto appealing to audiences, but I think his being a knucklehead gives him an appeal." [...] He believed it was Naruto's losses that made readers identify with him, although he wanted Naruto not to feel defeat again, which was his primary aim when writing the series. Kishimoto has said that Naruto's burning desire to be a ninja was based on his own ambition to succeed as a manga artist.|$|E
500|$|Simpson {{described}} Irresistibles {{material as}} [...] "Mariah Carey meets Britney Spears ... very mature but accessible to teens." [...] She {{said that she}} wanted to blend house, R, pop genres into the record. The opening track, [...] "Irresistible", is an R song with dance-pop influences. It also exhibits elements of pop rock and funk genres, while incorporating latin rhythms. Aside from including a string section, the track features Simpson's breathy vocals, spoken passages and a mid-section breakdown, where her vocals are [...] "funk-fortified". According to author Ben Graham, the lyrics of the song see Simpson stripping her famous virginity image down. Bob Waliszewski of Plugged In gave a similar observation of the lyrics, writing that they point to an imminent sexual compromise. [...] "A Little Bit" [...] is a dance-pop song following the same beat-oriented pattern as [...] "Irresistible". It features piano instrumentation and Simpson sings the lyrics as rapid-fire verses and with start-and-stop hooks. Simpson again adopts breathy vocals, and the lyrics <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> she expects from her partner: [...] "A little more time, a little less wait / A little more heart, a little less break". The lyrics also demand healthy changes in her relationship. [...] "Forever In Your Eyes" [...] explores elements of Latin music, as the song is backed by Spanish guitar and infused with hip-hop beats. The lyrics describe a couple in love lying together [...] "all through the night". [...] "There You Were" [...] is a torchy power ballad which drew comparisons to Simpson's previous song [...] "Where You Are" [...] (2000). The lyrics of the song are a homage to the protagonist's partner, who changed her life. The song received negative response from critics, with some calling it [...] "sappy" [...] and [...] "unnecessary". [...] "What's It Gonna Be" [...] is a bubblegum pop song influenced by '80s funk music, which was compared to outtakes from Spears' Oops!... I Did It Again (2000). The lyrics deal with Simpson expecting a reply from her lover regarding his fear of commitment.|$|E
