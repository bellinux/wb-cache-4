5|$|Before Ryan White, AIDS was {{a disease}} stigmatized as an illness {{impacting}} the gay community, {{because it was}} first diagnosed among gay men. That perception shifted as Ryan and other prominent HIV-infected people such as Magic Johnson, Arthur Ashe and the Ray brothers appeared in <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>to</b> advocate for more AIDS research and public education to address the epidemic. The U.S. Congress passed a major piece of AIDS legislation, the Ryan White CARE Act, shortly after White's death. The Act has been reauthorized twice; Ryan White Programs are the largest provider of services for people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States.|$|E

On June 7, after winning {{most of the}} states in the final major round of primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn in which she became the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major American political party. By campaign's end, Clinton had won 2,219 pledged delegates to Sanders' 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates compared to Sanders' 47. She received almost 17 million votes during the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders' 13 million.|$|E

5|$|The 2014 Winter Paralympic Games is {{the first}} such Paralympics hosted by Russia. Russia {{ratified}} the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities during that period.

5|$|Despite {{the regular}} season success, the team entered the playoffs under a cloud. In February, Hasek had {{suffered}} an adductor muscle injury while playing for the Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team during the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. He had played only one game for the Czechs and returned to Ottawa to heal, but would never play for the Senators again. Rookie goaltender Ray Emery had {{to take over the}} starting goaltender duties, leading <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>to</b> predict an early playoff exit due to Hasek's absence. Hopes were raised in the first round, however, when Emery would become the first rookie goaltender since Philadelphia's Brian Boucher in 2000 to win a playoff series when the Senators defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning four games to one. However, the Senators then lost to the Buffalo Sabres in the second round, a series in which all games were decided by one goal.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to a small}} {{customer}} base in Japan, Alisia Dragoon sold few copies on its release (April 24, 1992); the console it was made for, the Sega Mega Drive, was not a popular device in Japan, selling 33.5million units (10% of all Mega Drives/Genesis sold around the world). The game was published earlier by Sega for North America and Europe, on March 30. However, it was a subdued release; Sega did not place major advertisements for the game in <b>the</b> <b>media.</b> <b>To</b> localize the contents for the Western market, the video game publisher made several cosmetic changes to Alisia Dragoon. Instead of a big-eyed heroine drawn in typical anime styling, Alisia was portrayed as a golden bikini-wearing female barbarian on the box covers outside Japan. The Western version of Alisia was likened to the scantily clad females in artist Boris Vallejo's work.|$|E
5|$|Facing the eighth-seeded Los Angeles Kings in {{the opening}} round of the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs, Luongo started {{the first two games}} and played well but his team lost both. Vigneault opted to start Schneider {{for the rest of the}} series, in order to give the Canucks some momentum, and Luongo {{remained}} on the bench for the remainder of the series as the Kings won four games to one. Dressing as a backup for the Canucks' final three playoff games led many in <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>to</b> believe that Luongo would be traded in the off-season, in favour of Schneider, who recorded better regular season and playoff statistics than him in 2011–12. Asked about his role with the Canucks following the defeat, Luongo told reporters that he would waive his no-trade clause if management asked him to. In June 2012, Schneider was signed to a three-year $12 million contract, which made Luongo expendable, but general manager Mike Gillis' efforts to trade Luongo were unsuccessful due to his $64 million (U.S.), 12-year contract.|$|E

5|$|Following the McIntosh-Prescott Report, which {{indicated}} the long-term faults {{with the class}} that still required solving, successful {{efforts were made to}} bring the submarines to operational standard. As part of this, a public relations plan was implemented to provide up-to-date information on the submarines to <b>the</b> <b>media,</b> <b>to</b> improve the public perception of the class by providing factual information on the status of the project and responding to queries and incidents. This same period saw the dispelling of the idea, widely held within the RAN, that the Collins-class boats would be like any other vessel previously ordered by the RAN: in service with another navy, well tested, and with all the problems solved before they entered Australian hands. The RAN began to realise that as the parent navy for the class, they had a greater responsibility than normal in ensuring that the boats were at an operational standard.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the German 500 at EuroSpeedway Lausitz due to financial difficulties, {{it was announced that}} the race at Rockingham was going ahead as scheduled. The chief executive of the track invited German CART fans to attend the Rockingham 500. Franchitti, considered by <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>to</b> be the pre-race favourite, said a victory at Rockingham would be the highlight of his season and that he wanted to entertain the spectators. Having finished second in the previous year's race, Kenny Bräck believed he could continue his good run of results in Europe and hoped the racing would be competitive. Da Matta said his team had made a large number of adjustments to his car's setup on ovals and hoped his vehicle would be better than it was in Motegi. He believed the Rockingham 500 was important and hoped to secure a top-three finishing position. Carpentier said although he was disappointed with his previous result at the track, he was convinced {{he would be able to}} improve his performance.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the British victory at Second Battle of El Alamein in November 1942, and other {{military}} reverses, the Propaganda Ministry directed <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>to</b> emphasise Rommel's invincibility. The charade was maintained until the spring of 1943, even as the German situation in Africa became increasingly precarious. In May 1943, to ensure that the inevitable defeat in Africa would not be associated with Rommel's name, Goebbels had the Supreme High Command announce that Rommel was on a two-month leave for health reasons. Instead, the campaign was presented by Berndt, who resumed his role in the Propaganda Ministry, as a ruse to tie down the British Empire while Germany was turning Europe into an impenetrable fortress, with Rommel at the helm of this success. After the radio program ran in May 1943, Rommel sent Berndt a case of cigars as a sign of his gratitude.|$|E
50|$|In media studies, {{there are}} two models used to {{construct}} audience reception.

5|$|Prior to the visit, the US {{government}} and the AFV made thorough preparations to make Diệm's visit pleasant, and the AFV successfully lobbied <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>to</b> write favourable reports on the South Vietnamese leader. Diệm was trumpeted {{as a champion of}} democracy, and mentions of his autocratic style and election rigging were avoided. Diệm arrived by plane in Washington, D.C. on May 8, and was personally greeted at the airport by President Dwight D. Eisenhower—an honor Eisenhower accorded to only one other visiting head of state. Diệm's motorcade was greeted by 50,000 wellwishers and his address to the US Congress and his policies were heartily endorsed by both sides of politics. During his time in the US capital, Diệm also attended receptions, and had private meetings with both Eisenhower and the US Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, to discuss American support for South Vietnam, although the meeting with Dulles was ineffectual as Diệm spoke continuously, rendering two-way discussions impossible.|$|E
5|$|The Conservative {{government}} {{believed there}} was a need for it to act to prevent Sinn Féin from using <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>to</b> defend the actions of the IRA, and the measures were part of a wider government response to the increase in violence, which also included changes to the right to silence and the tightening of rules allowing paramilitary prisoners early release. Further controversy also erupted in September 1988 over an intended edition of the Channel 4 discussion programme After Dark which was to have featured the Sinn Féin president, Gerry Adams, as a guest. The show was dropped after the conservative academic Paul Wilkinson – a Professor at Aberdeen University who specialised in the study of terrorism and political violence – voiced strong objections to its transmission (more details here).|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on September 26, 1913 and played in theaters throughout the United States. The unbilled cast list has been stated to include Lon Chaney {{in the role of}} the pawn broker. The propaganda film was billed as a popular love story by theaters, but the production was the subject of much concern by organized charities. The Charity Organization Societies sought to produce a film to counter the negative portrayal of charities in The Blood Red Tape of Charity. P. L. Whitney stopped short of directly calling the film's portrayal dangerous, but advocated that charity members use <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>to</b> highlight the film's faults and exaggerations. Patricia Erens would use the surviving film still of the pawn broker, claimed to be Lon Chaney by scholars, as an example of Jewish character archetypes that were prominent in silent films. The film is now considered lost.|$|E
