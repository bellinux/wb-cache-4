AAA bought Konnan's claim and replaced Cibernético and Octagón, who was injured in a backstage assault by someone resembling Cibernético (later revealed as Super Fly), in the match with Dark Ozz and Dark Cuervo. However, in the end Cibernético interfered in the match and helped AAA pick up the win. Afterwards, Cibernético, upset with AAA and in particular his friend La Parka for believing he had turned on the company, decided to re–form Los Bizarros with Amadeus, Escoria, Nygma and Taboo.

On March 13, 2011, La Milicia and La Sociedad member Billy el Malo, who had been secretly working for Cibernético since at least October 2010, made a jump to Los Bizarros. In May, La Parka formed his own group El Inframundo ("The Underworld") to counteract Los Bizarros. On June 18 at Triplemanía XIX, Cibernético, Billy el Malo, Charly Manson and Escoria defeated La Parka, Dark Ozz, Drago and Octagón, when Cibernético pinned Parka following a distraction from Taboo, who appeared {{at the top of the}} ramp with his son.

50|$|In March, 2010 {{signs of}} dissention amongst the Trios champions began showing as Garza {{walked out on}} the team during a trios match mistakenly {{thinking}} {{that one of his}} team mates had attacked him. Following the walk out Garza kept insincerely insisting that he was still a tecnico and that his team was getting along great. Further doubts about Garza's allegiance arose when he teamed up with the Rúdo Pólvora to win the 2010 Gran Alternativa tournament. When Garza, La Máscara and Hijo del Fantasma were booked for a CMLL World Trios defense the following week Garza complained that his partners agreed to the match without asking him, but swore that he would still be professional about it. During the title defense on the May 7, 2010 Super Viernes Garza attacked both Hijo del Fantasma and La Máscara, allowing La Ola Amarilla (Hiroshi Tanahashi, Okumura and Taichi) to win the CMLL World Trios Championship, turning full blown rudo in the process. On October 28, 2012 Hijo del Fantasma unsuccessfully challenged Dragón Rojo, Jr. for the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship, the highest profile match Hijo del Fantasma competed so far in 2012. El Hijo del Fantasma was teamed up with rudo El Felino for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles ("National Incredible Pairs Tournament"), a tag team tournament teaming rudos with <b>technicos.</b> The team lost to La Máscara and Averno in the first round despite Averno and La Máscara being long time rivals.|$|R
2500|$|The Sin Piedad event drew about a {{half full}} Arena Mexico, with the {{official}} attendance of 10,500, which caused CMLL to darken out the upper portion of the balcony section, something they had not had {{to do for a}} major event in several months. In the opening match of the show young <b>technico</b> Flash made his Arena Mexico debut, teaming with fellow young <b>technico</b> Super Nova to face off against Los Hombres del Camoflaje, Artillero and Súper Comando, two masked rudos who both have military themed masks and ring characters. The third and final fall went to the tecnico team, winning by disqualification when Artillero pulled Flash's mask off after brutalizing the young rookie for several minutes. The action of the second match suffered from La Amapola hurting her hip during the match and had to be removed from the ring, forcing the officials to shorten the match to a single fall. In the end the tecnico team of Dark Angel, Marcela and Sahori won the fall in 12 minutes and six seconds. The third match of the night was also the first proper best two-out-of-three falls six-man tag team match, the most common match type in CMLL.

The third match of the evening, which saw Lady Apache and Las Ladies de Polanco (Princesa Blanca and Princesa Sujei) face off against the team of Dark Angel, Goya Kong and Luna Magica, centered around the developing rivalry between Dark Angel and Lady Apache, which only intensified when Lady Apache cheated by holding the ropes to gain the third and deciding fall for her team.

2500|$|The {{main event}} {{match for the}} 81st Anniversary show was the {{culmination}} of a storyline feud between Atlantis and Último Guerrero that had its start several years prior. In 2005 Atlantis was a well established, veteran tecnico who held the CMLL World Tag Team Championship with Blue Panther. During a match on June 25, 2005 against Guerrero and Rey Bucanero Atlantis turned on his partner during the match and cost them the titles. Following the match the now Rudo Atlantis joined up the group Los Guerreros del Infierno ("The Infernal Warriors"), who renamed the group Los Guerreros de la Atlantida ("The Warriors of Atlantis") out of respect for their new co-leader. Atlantis, Último Guerrero and Negro Casas won the CMLL World Trios Championship and held it for 166 days, before losing it on January 1, 2009, to El Hijo del Fantasma, Héctor Garza and La Máscara. On November 2, 2009, Atlantis won his fourth CMLL World Tag Team Championship, this time teaming with Último Guerrero to defeat Místico and Negro Casas for the championship. They later lost the Tag Team championship to Averno and Mephisto on February 1, 2010. In late 2009 it was rumored that Los Guerreros de la Atlantida had split up, but when Atlantis and Último Guerrero teamed up on CMLL's Sin Salida show, to prove that the rumors were not be true. On November 2, 2010, Guerrero and Dragón Rojo, Jr., who replaced an injured Atlantis, defeated Mr. Águila and Héctor Garza to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. After the title win, Rojo, Jr. was made an official member of Los Guerreros de la Atlantida. Following Dragón Rojo's induction into the group Atlantis teamed less and less with his team mates. In June, 2011 Atlantis replaced an injured Shocker and teamed with the tecnico team of Delta and Guerrero Maya, Jr. in the Forjando un Ídolo tournament, which they eventually went on to win. After weeks of tension between Atlantis and Último Guerrero, CMLL held a press conference on August 11, where Atlantis officially turned <b>technico</b> and left Los Guerreros de la Atlantida. Guerrero and Atlantis faced each other in a big grudge match on September 23, which saw Atlantis pick up the win. On the August 3 Super Viernes show, Guerrero and Rojo, Jr. lost the CMLL World Tag Team Championship to Atlantis and Diamante Azul, ending their reign at 640 days, the longest reign in the title's history. On November 16, Atlantis announced that he was officially forming a stable named Los Reyes de la Atlantida ("The Kings of Atlantis") with Delta and Guerrero Maya, Jr. to help him combat Los Guerreros del Infierno. On the August 3 Super Viernes show, Atlantis and Diamante Azul defeated Dragón Rojo, Jr. and Último Guerrero to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. In early 2013 the long running feud between Atlantis and Último Guerrero came to the forefront of CMLL booking once more. The two were booked for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles tournament, forcing the two rivals to team up. Before their qualifying round both Atlantis and Gurrero stated that they would put their differences aside {{for the sake of the}} tournament. Atlantis and Guerrero displayed the teamwork they had developed by being partners in Los Guerreros del Atlantida for several years as they defeated the teams of Valiente and Pólvora, Diamante Azul and Euforia and finally Dragón Rojo, Jr. and Niebla Roja to qualify for the finals of the tournament. The finals took place as part of the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show and saw La Sombra and Volador, Jr. win the match and the tournament. Following the loss a frustrated Atlantis attacked Último Guerrero and tore his mask apart. Atlantis subsequently made a Luchas de Apuestas challenge to Último Guerrero that was not immediately accepted. The two rivals officially signed the contrat for the mask vs. mask match on March 21, but did not announce an actual date for the match. At the same press conference it was announced that CMLL would commemorate Atlantis' 30 year anniversary as a wrestler with a special Super Viernes show on May 3. During the celebration of Atlantis' 30th anniversary as a wrestler Guerrero appeared after a match to berate Atlantis, which turned out to be a distraction for the real Último Guerrero to attack Atlantis from behind. The two identically dressed Guerreros proceeded to beat up Atlantis and tear his mask apart. Following the match Último Guerrero introduced his brother [...] "Gran Guerrero". The much anticipated and hyped Mask vs. Mask match between Guerrero and Atlantis at the 80th Anniversary Show on September 13 never came to fruition as the two were defeated in a Relevos Suicidas match by La Sombra and Volador Jr., who instead advanced to the Lucha de Apuestas against each other. During the semi-final match of the 2014 Juicio Final show Atlantis and Último Guerrero were once again on opposite sides of the six-man tag team match. In the first fall Guerrero pulled Atlantis' mask and pinned him, when Atlantis tried to use the same tactics in the second fall he was disqualified and lost the match for his team. Following the match Guerrero insisted on CMLL officially announcing the match between the two. Moments later Juan Manual Mar, representing the CMLL executive team came to the ring and announced that the two would finally face off in a Lucha de Apuestas match for their masks at the 81st Anniversary show.|$|E

After the match he unmasked and announced that his real name was Jorge Luis Casas Ruiz. On September 30, 2011, at CMLL's 78th Anniversary Show, El Felino won Rey Bucanero's hair in a ten-man steel cage match. In October 2011, El Felino became one of four CMLL wrestlers featured in an A&E Latinoamericano documentary series titled El Luchador. In late 2011, El Felino began feuding with Blue Panther, which led to a Hair vs. Hair match on December 16 at Sin Piedad. A week prior to the match, Panther was disqualified in a tag team match, after giving El Felino a Martinete. This led to the Distrito Federal Box y Lucha Commission announcing that Panther was suspended for two weeks, starting after the December 16 event. At Sin Piedad, El Felino tried to exact revenge on Panther, but was disqualified after the referee caught him going for a Martinete. As a result, El Felino was shaved bald. El Felino was teamed up with tecnico El Hijo del Fantasma for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles ("National Incredible Pairs Tournament"), a tag team tournament teaming rudos with <b>technicos.</b> The team lost to La Máscara and Averno in the first round despite Averno and La Máscara being long time rivals. On March 15, 2013 El Felino teamed up with his sons Tiger and Puma to defeat the team of Guerrero Maya Jr., Delta and Tritón in the opening match of the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas. On February 18, 2014, El Felino, Mr. Niebla and Negro Casas defeated La Máscara, Rush and Titán to win the Mexican National Trios Championship. They lost the title to Los Reyes de la Atlantida (Atlantis, Delta and Guerrero Maya Jr.) on April 26, 2015.|$|R

5000|$|The Sin Piedad event drew about a {{half full}} Arena Mexico, with the {{official}} attendance of 10,500, which caused CMLL to darken out the upper portion of the balcony section, something they had not had {{to do for a}} major event in several months. In the opening match of the show young <b>technico</b> Flash made his Arena Mexico debut, teaming with fellow young <b>technico</b> Super Nova to face off against Los Hombres del Camoflaje, Artillero and Súper Comando, two masked rudos who both have military themed masks and ring characters. The third and final fall went to the tecnico team, winning by disqualification when Artillero pulled Flash's mask off after brutalizing the young rookie for several minutes. The action of the second match suffered from La Amapola hurting her hip during the match and had to be removed from the ring, forcing the officials to shorten the match to a single fall. In the end the tecnico team of Dark Angel, Marcela and Sahori won the fall in 12 minutes and six seconds. The third match of the night was also the first proper best two-out-of-three falls six-man tag team match, the most common match type in CMLL. The match saw team captain Dr. Wagner Jr. team up with Dos Caras Jr. and Rey Bucanero defeating the team of L.A. Park and Los Guerreros team members Eclipse and Olímpico in three falls, ending the match after 13 minutes and five seconds when Dr. Wagner pinned Eclipse after using his [...] "Dr. Wagner Driver" [...] (Sitout scoop slam piledriver) finishing move and moments later Rey Bucanero pinned Olímpico to take the match for their side.|$|E
50|$|Many gay wrestlers show {{in their}} {{performances}} {{that they may}} identify as a female, but {{can be just as}} strong as a male, and can deliver a great performance just like any other male wrestler. Lucha libre is a performance that is open to multiple readings on axis of representation by two men. Many Lucha Libre matches cannot be described as a struggle between two men, because not all wrestlers are male, and not all male wrestlers are unambiguously men. A lucha libre match between two men represents a rudo and a <b>technico</b> (evil and good), in which most exoticos end up being rudos. This does not apply to all exoticos, but the audience usually responds to them being a rudo.|$|E
