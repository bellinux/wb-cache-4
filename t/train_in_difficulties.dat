40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the efficacy of family management <b>training</b> <b>in</b> reducing anxiety <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> preschool children (4 to 6 years old) in Ahvaz. Materials and Methods: The present research is a pilot study with pre-test/post-test control group design. A total of 50 mothers whose children scored 1. 0 standard deviation above the mean on Spence’s children anxiety scale (parent report form) were randomly chosen and then divided into experimental and control groups. According to the treatment plan, the participants underwent ten 120 -minute sessions of family anxiety management training. Results: Multivariate analysis of covariance demonstrates that experimental intervention is efficient in reduction of children anxiety (p= 0. 03). Following up the experimental group for a course of one month show that intervention impact can last over the time. Conclusion: The results indicate that family anxiety management training has been effective in reduction of anxiety disorders in anxious children (4 to 6 years old), studying at kindergartens within Ahvaz.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{gain insight into}} the {{gatekeeper}} role of surgeons and gastroenterologists (including residents) during a first consultation at a tertiary gastro-intestinal centre regarding referral for genetic counselling, and to test the feasibility of a checklist for indications for referral. Consecutive patients were invited before and after introduction of a checklist, to complete a questionnaire assessing their perception of discussing cancer genetic topics. Initial consultations were audiotaped to assess the quality of this discussion by gastroenterologists and surgeons. Data on completeness of the checklist and referral were collected from medical files. No {{significant differences were found}} between the Before and After group regarding patients' reports of discussing cancer in the family (77 %, n = 34 vs 89 %, n = 33, p = 0. 16). In 28 % (n = 10) of the audiotaped consultations family history was adequately discussed, in 58 % (n = 21) it was considered inadequate and in 14 % (n = 5) of consultations it was not discussed at all. A checklist was present in 53 % (n = 27) of the medical files. Of these, 5 (19 %) were incomplete. Gastroenterologists and surgeons (<b>in</b> <b>training)</b> have <b>difficulty</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling their gatekeeper role of recognizing patients at familial risk for CRC. Although they often discuss familial cancer during the initial consultation, their exploration seems insufficient to reveal indications for referral for genetic counselling.

Previous studies on the subject have been hampered by inadequate measures of teacher <b>training</b> and <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> addressing the non-random selection of teachers to students and of teachers to training. We address these issues by estimating models that include detailed measures of pre-service and in-service training, a rich set of time-varying covariates, and student, teacher, and school fixed effects.

The largest gains from experience occur in the first few years, but we find continuing gains beyond {{the first five years of}} a teacher's career. In contrast, we do not find a consistent relationship between formal professional development training and teacher productivity.

The arguments for euthanasia have to do with quality of life, respect for autonomy and dissatisfaction with the current situation. Arguments against euthanasia are the right to a good death, belief in the possibilities offered by palliative care, religious objections and the fear of abuse.

40|$|Background: Palliative care is an {{integral}} part of the general practitioner‘s role and palliative care teaching and training should be available for GP registrars during vocational training. Aim: This study was carried out to evaluate the content, amount and nature of generic palliative care teaching during vocational <b>training</b> <b>in</b> the UK. Method: A postal questionnaire survey of all course organizers enquired as to whether palliative care teaching was included <b>in</b> the core <b>training</b> sessions; professional background of the teachers; teaching methods used; whether the local hospice was used as a resource and whether GP registrars were able to choose a post in a hospice within their training scheme. Results: Three hundred and seventy-seven questionnaires were distributed and 240 were returned completed ¡ / a 64 % response rate. A total of nine one-year schemes replied that they did not include any teaching in palliative care ¡ / the median amount of teaching given for one-year schemes was 4. 75 hours and nine hours for the three-year schemes. Statistically significant differences were found in teaching on psychosocial issues and bereavement between one- and three-year schemes. Less than half of all schemes included teaching on financial issues related to palliative care. Several schemes cited <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> accessing hospice placements and in accessing hospice medical staff to provide teaching. Conclusion: There is wide disparity in both the amount and content of teaching about palliative care within UK vocational <b>training</b> schemes. <b>Difficulty</b> <b>in</b> accessing placements within hospices and in accessing staff from such units to undertake teaching may be a barrier to effective and comprehensive palliative care teaching for doctors working in primary care.

40|$|Conversational speech {{exhibits}} considerable pronunciation variability, {{which has}} been shown to have a detrimental effect on the accuracy of automatic speech recognition. There have been many attempts to model pronunciation variation, including the use of decision-trees to generate alternate word pronunciations from phonemic baseforms. Use of such pronunciation models during recognition is known to improve accuracy. This paper describes the use of such pronunciation models during acoustic model <b>training.</b> Subtle <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> the straightforward use of alternatives to canonical pronunciations are first illustrated: it is shown that simply improving the accuracy of the phonetic transcription used for acoustic model training is of little benefit. Analysis of this paradox leads to a new method of accommodating nonstandard pronunciations: rather than allowing a phoneme in the canonical pronunciation to be realized as one of a few distinct alternate phones predicted by the pronunciation model, the HMM states of the phoneme's model are instead allowed to share Gaussian mixture components with the HMM states of the model of the alternate realization. Qualitatively, this amounts to making a soft decision about which surface-form is realized.
