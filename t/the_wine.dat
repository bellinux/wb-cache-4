5|$|In winemaking, fruit sugars are {{converted}} into alcohol by a fermentation process. If the must formed by pressing the fruit {{has a low}} sugar content, additional sugar may be added to raise the alcohol content of <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> in a process called chaptalization. In the production of sweet wines, fermentation may be halted before it has run its full course, leaving behind some residual sugar that gives <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> its sweet taste.|$|E

While Wine's NTDLL, USER32, KERNEL32, GDI32, and ADVAPI32 components cannot be used directly by ReactOS due to architectural differences, code snippets of them and other parts can be shared between both projects. The kernel is developed by ReactOS separately as Wine relies here on existing Unix-like kernels.|$|E

5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is a very}} {{bold and}} {{assertive}} wine that has potential to overwhelm light and delicate dishes. The wine's high tannin content {{as well as the}} oak influences and high alcohol levels associated with many regional styles play important roles in influencing how well <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> matches with different foods. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, all those elements are at their peak, but as <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> ages it mellows; possibilities for different food pairings open up. In most circumstances, matching the weight (alcohol level and body) of <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> to the heaviness of the food is an important consideration. Cabernet Sauvignons with high alcohol levels do not pair well with spicy foods due to hotness levels of the capsaicins present in spices like chili peppers being enhanced by the alcohol with the heat accentuating the bitterness of the tannins. Milder spices, such as black pepper, pair better due to their ability to minimize the perception of tannins—such as in the classic pairings of Cabernet Sauvignon with steak au poivre and pepper-crusted ahi tuna.|$|E

2500|$|Wine expert Jancis Robinson {{describes}} them as [...] "country cousins" [...] {{in contrast}} to the more well known <b>wines</b> of <b>the</b> Côte d'Or but praises <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> for their usefulness as early drinking wines that usually do not require much aging. Rather than compare them to <b>the</b> Côte d'Or, <b>wine</b> expert Tom Stevenson recommends thinking of <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> of <b>the</b> Côte Chalonnaise as more of a better quality Mâconnais than a lower quality Côte de Beaune. Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan praises <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> of <b>the</b> Côte Chalonnaise for their relative affordability {{in contrast to}} <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> of <b>the</b> Côte d'Or.

5|$|In the United Kingdom, English wine {{producers}} have experimented with growing the variety in plastic tunnels which {{can create a}} greenhouse effect and protect the grapes from the less than ideal climate of <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> region. While the grape is permitted to be planted in some German wine regions (such as the Mosel), the vineyard sites best suited for ripening Cabernet are generally already occupied with Riesling; many producers are ill-inclined to uproot the popular German variety in favor of Cabernet Sauvignon. In the 1980s, inexpensive Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon was highly touted for its value and helped to establish that country's wine industry and garner it more international presence in <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> market. The grape is performing a similar function for many countries in Eastern Europe, including Turkey, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Slovenia, and Ukraine. It {{can be in the}} eastern Mediterranean wine regions of Cyprus, Greece, Israel and Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> {{regions of}} the Left Bank, the Cabernet {{influence}} of <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> has shown unique characteristics in the different regions. In Saint-Estèphe and Pessac-Léognan, the grape develops more mineral flavors. Aromas of violets are a characteristic of Margaux. Pauillac is noted by a strong lead pencil scent and Saint-Julien by cedar and cigar boxes. The Cabernet wines of the Moulis are characterized by their soft tannins and rich fruit flavors while the southern Graves region is characterized by strong blackcurrant flavors, though in less intense wines over all. The percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon used in the blend will depend on terroir and the winemakers styles {{as well as the}} vintage. The First Growth estates of Château Mouton Rothschild and Château Latour are noted for regularly producing wines with some of the highest percentage of Cabernet— often around 75%.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), meanwhile, is {{producing}} his own wine, called Donaghy Estate Sparkling Wine. He and Liz taste it, {{and realize that}} it is practically undrinkable. This leaves Jack with the problem of disposing with <b>the</b> <b>wine.</b> He decides to market it to hip-hop producer Ridikolous (LL Cool J), {{and at the same time}} patch up things between Tracy and Ridikolous, who was not allowed into one of Tracy's parties. Jack and Ridikolous have a meeting, resulting in <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> becoming the corporate sponsor of the Source Awards, which is being produced by Ridikolous. To further mend things with Tracy, Jack proposes to let Tracy host the award show. This backfires when Tracy refuses to host it in fear that he will get shot, but Jack still sees it as the only way to work things out with Ridikolous.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from different regions can also influence how well <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have lots of different flavor influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon {{has the potential to}} pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. <b>The</b> <b>wine</b> can typically pair well with a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue cheeses will typically compete too much with the flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.|$|E

5|$|Along with Riesling, Sauvignon blanc {{was one of}} {{the first}} fine wines to be bottled with a screwcap in {{commercial}} quantities, especially by New Zealand producers. <b>The</b> <b>wine</b> is usually consumed young, as it does not particularly benefit from aging, as varietal Sauvignon blancs tend to develop vegetal aromas reminiscent of peas and asparagus with extended aging. Dry and sweet white Bordeaux, including oak-aged examples from Pessac-Léognan and Graves, as well as some Loire wines from Pouilly-Fumé and Sancerre are some of the few examples of Sauvignon blancs with aging potential.|$|E
5|$|Before {{technology}} in wineries could stabilize temperatures, the low temperatures in winter {{of the northern}} German regions would halt fermentation and leave the resulting wines with natural sugars and a low alcohol content.
