5|$|The Emperor {{is known}} to hold the nominal {{ceremonial}} authority. For example, the Emperor is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> {{has the authority to}} appoint the Prime Minister, even though the Diet has the power to designate the person fitted for the position. One such example can be prominently seen in the 2009 Dissolution of the House of Representatives. The House was expected to be dissolved on the advice of the Prime Minister, but was temporarily unable to do so for the next general election, as both the Emperor and Empress were visiting Canada.|$|E

Although two parties expressed interest in the station during the frequency change stage (individual Clifton Thomas of Jackson and Dain Schult Radioactivity, Inc. of East Point, Georgia), a local third contender, Gordon ("Jerry") J. Lousteau, Jr., of WMGO 1370 AM in Canton was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> responded to the FCC's public notice, and therefore his WMGO Broadcasting Corporation was granted the license.

25|$|A {{demolition}} team {{is about}} to bring down a building when one worker is drawn to an area not marked on the blueprints. Inside the area they find a path to the building's foundation, and in the darkness, a boy (Spencer List). The boy is taken to a children's hospital and the Fringe division is contacted. The construction workers examined where the boy was found and determined it had been sealed off for seventy years and could not determine how the boy got inside. The boy does not speak, and Walter Bishop (John Noble) explains some of his medical conditions {{as a result of}} living underground for several years. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) seems to be <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> the boy reacts to, and she helps to coax him to help in his treatment. At one point, she encourages him to eat by sharing candy with him, but he only places the yellow pieces {{in the form of an}} arrow for her.|$|E
25|$|In October 2010, it was {{confirmed}} that Amy Adams, Chris Cooper and Rashida Jones {{would also be}} starring in the film. Over the next few months, several guest cameo announcements emerged, including, but not limited to Emily Blunt, Ricky Gervais, Zach Galifianakis, Billy Crystal, Jack Black, Alan Arkin and Dave Grohl. However, Gervais, Crystal and several other cameos including Beth Broderick, Kathy Griffin, Ed Helms, Sterling Knight, Mila Kunis, Ben Stiller, Eric Stonestreet, Wanda Sykes Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Danny Trejo were completely omitted from the film due to time constraints. Jim Parsons' cameo was kept as a secret by producers despite rumors that leaked on the Internet regarding his role in the film. In a March 2009 interview on The Late Late Show, Segel revealed that he had asked host Craig Ferguson to appear in the film, and at the time, he (Ferguson) had been <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> had agreed. Ferguson was ultimately not given a role, for which he chastised Segel in a November 2011 interview. A cameo was written for the Sesame Street Muppet Elmo, but was rejected by Disney's attorneys and representatives from Sesame Workshop.|$|E

Brian Davis replied, [...] "You know, they talk all this Uncle Tom sh** and, you know, I'm like, I'm more hood and street than any mother f***** on that team. To say that about us, we knew was ridiculous. Because they all wanted to go Duke. Chris Webber visited Duke and stayed with me."

500|$|Chaplin {{finished}} editing City Lights in December 1930, {{by which}} time silent films were an anachronism. A preview before an unsuspecting public audience was not a success, but a showing for the press produced positive reviews. One journalist wrote, [...] "Nobody {{in the world but}} Charlie Chaplin could have done it. He is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> has that peculiar something called 'audience appeal' in sufficient quality to defy the popular penchant for movies that talk." [...] Given its general release in January 1931, City Lights proved to be a popular and financial success – eventually grossing over $3 million. The British Film Institute cites it as Chaplin's finest accomplishment, and the critic James Agee hails the closing scene as [...] "the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies". City Lights became Chaplin's personal favourite of his films and remained so throughout his life.|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{was pleased}} that the writers decided to let her {{character}} discover Walter's secret, commenting [...] "Astrid finds out in a really emotional way because Walter lets it slip to her accidentally. I {{think that it was}} really nice for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At least she knows that she's a part of this family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has {{to step up to the}} plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress and go back to the place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution. And of course we don't want that." ...|$|E
50|$|Vesper {{follows the}} {{character}} of Emily Webb, a geeky girl that's more likely {{to stay at home}} and watch old horror films than go to parties. Unbeknownst to her, she's been sneaking out to go to parties and thrill seek when Emily thought she was asleep. She first takes notice of her nocturnal activities when one of her classmates that shares her name has been found murdered. Despite her attempts to prevent herself from going out, Emily's other self keeps going out and getting wilder with each passing night. This other Emily is not only wilder, but stronger and faster than her normal self.

500|$|Like Lana, {{who held}} {{emptiness}} inside her {{after the loss}} of her parents, which she tried to fill with the men in her life, Lex attempts to fill his own void, over the loss of his mother, with the women in his life. According to writer Holly Harold, Lex [...] "needs and wants to be loved". Rosenbaum agrees, and feels that Lex is searching for that [...] "unconditional love". The actor likens this feeling to one that everyone can relate to, but that Lex fails to achieve with not only the women he develops relationships with, but also with his own father. Rosenbaum and Annette O'Toole (Martha Kent) agree that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> could give Lex that love is his mother, who died when he was a child. Whenever they have scenes together, O'Toole and Rosenbaum try and hint around the idea that Martha wants to provide that love for Lex, because she recognizes that he needs it, and that Lex really wants her to provide it as well.|$|E

But I reached out to him about doing 'Birthday Cake' because that’s <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>that,</b> really, it made sense to do the record. Just as a musician, despite everything else, that was going to be the person. You know I thought about rappers, and I’ve done that so many times, and the hottest R artist out right now is Chris Brown. So I wanted him on the track, and then in turn he was like, ‘Why don’t you do the remix to my track?’ and it was a trade-off. We did two records. One for my fans, one for his fans, and that way our fans can come together. There shouldn’t be a divide. You know? It’s music, and it’s innocent." [...] In March 2012, American rapper Fabolous released his own verse to the [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] remix. The following month, Rick Ross also released the track featuring an added rap verse from himself, along with the previously incorporated Chris Brown verses. Busta Rhymes released his own freestyle to the song along with rapper Reek da Villian.|$|E

This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E
