5|$|Development of Silent Hill {{started in}} September 1996. The game {{was created by}} Team Silent, a group of staff members within the Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo studio. The new owners of its parent company Konami sought to produce a game that would be {{successful}} in the United States. For this reason, a Hollywood-like atmosphere was proposed for Silent Hill. The staff members that were assigned to the game's development had failed at their previous projects. They intended to leave Konami, as they were not allowed to realize their own ideas, and were not compatible with the company's other teams. According to composer Akira Yamaoka, the developers {{did not know how to}} proceed with the Silent Hill project, either. As the time passed, the personnel and management of Konami lost their faith in the game, and the members of Team Silent increasingly felt like outsiders. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, however, the developers of Silent Hill had much artistic freedom because the game was still produced as in the era of lower-budget 2D titles. Eventually, the development staff decided to ignore the limits of Konami's initial plan, and to make Silent Hill a game that would appeal to <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> players instead.|$|E
5|$|One {{does not}} only feel a social or {{external}} pressure to fulfill roles {{and expectations of}} being a good parent, sibling, or child, however. There is a distinctly emotional and internal pressure to be ‘good’ due to psychological attachments in spousal, sibling and/or parent-children relationships. Psychological persuasion in advertisements appeals to one's motives, attitudes and personalities. The family symbol is psychologically persuasive in that it appeals to the emotional attachments between spouses, siblings, or parent-child relationships. To continue the above example, the mother not only wants to purchase a product that purportedly limits irritation or harm for her child due to her social role and expectations, but also because she feels an emotional attachment to her child. The attempt to activate <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> audiences and to psychologically persuade is popular among advertisements. Family affects us significantly on this psychological level – {{the level at which}} advertisements are most effective.|$|E
5|$|The version by Aiken {{is perhaps}} the best known stage adaptation, {{released}} {{just a few months}} after the novel was published. This six-act behemoth also set an important precedent by being the first show on Broadway to stand on its own, without the performance of other entertainments or any afterpiece. Most of Aiken's dialogue is lifted verbatim from Stowe's novel and it included four full musical numbers written by the producer, George C. Howard. Another legacy of this adaptation is its reliance upon very different locations all portrayed on the same stage. This reliance led to large sets and set a precedent for the future days of film. By focusing on the stark and desperate situations of his characters, Aiken appealed to <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> his audiences. By combining this melodramatic approach with the content of Stowe's novel, Aiken helped to create a powerful visual indictment against the institution of slavery.|$|E
40|$|Psychological {{interrelation}} {{between the}} base odors (according to Amoore) and the base emotional states {{of human beings}} (according to Ekman) is established. The subjects were offered samples of the basic odors. Their task was to associate these odors with one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed basic <b>emotions.</b> <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> variance showed the significant association of putrid odor with <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> disgust, <b>the</b> odor <b>of</b> mint with <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> surprise, and <b>the</b> odor <b>of</b> musk with <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> anger. Other odors can cause two or three <b>emotions.</b> Based on <b>the</b> theoretical analysis, the article proposes to associate flowery odor with <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> joy, <b>the</b> odor <b>of</b> fruit with <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> pleasure, <b>the</b> pungent odor with <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> fear, and <b>the</b> odor <b>of</b> camphor with <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> sadness. Hypothesis {{of the existence of}} olfactory-emotional language allowing to create the emotional tone of the odor of any object, is offered...|$|R
5000|$|In Shand's view, <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> sorrow, {{which he}} classifies {{as a primary}} emotion, has two impulses: to cling to the object of sorrow, and to repair the {{injuries}} done to that object that caused <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> in <b>the</b> first place. Thus <b>the</b> primary <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> sorrow is <b>the</b> basis for <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> pity, which Shand describes as a fusion of sorrow and joy: sorrow at the injury done to the object of pity, and joy as an [...] "element of sweetness" [...] tinging that sorrow.|$|R
40|$|While {{there have}} been many {{attempts}} to estimate <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> an addresser from her/his utterance, few studies have ex-plored how her/his utterance affects <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> addressee. This has mo-tivated us to investigate two novel tasks: predicting <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> addressee and generating a response that elicits a specific <b>emotion</b> in <b>the</b> addressee’s mind. We target Japanese Twitter posts as a source of dialogue data and automatically build training data for learning the pre-dictors and generators. The feasibility of our approaches is assessed by using 1099 utterance-response pairs that are built by five human workers. ...|$|R

There is repetition of certain lines and phrases and this, added to the haunting music of the metre, is very appealing.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, the Circe {{episode was}} to be re-evaluated in two poetic sequels to the Odyssey. In the first of these, Giovanni Pascoli's L'Ultimo Viaggio (The Last Voyage, 1906), the aging hero sets out to rediscover <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> his youth by {{retracing}} his journey from Troy, {{only to discover that}} the island of Eea is deserted. What in his dream of love he had taken for the roaring of lions and Circe’s song was now no more than the sound of the sea-wind in autumnal oaks (Cantos 16-17).|$|E
25|$|In {{the center}} of the Valley of K is the Dull Lake, which is said in the novel's {{appendix}} to be named after the Dal Lake in Kashmir. This implies that Kashmir is the place on which K is based. The Dull Lake itself is the location of the Moody Land, a landscape whose weather changes to reflect <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> the people currently present in it. It is the place where the lead characters go at the behest of a corrupt politician, and where their adventures begin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{perception}} <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> using {{facial expressions}} reveals slight gender differences {{based on the}} definition and boundaries (essentially, the “edge line” where one emotion ends and a subsequent <b>emotion</b> begins) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> categories. <b>The</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> anger is perceived easier and quicker when it is displayed by males. However, the same effects are seen in <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> happiness when portrayed by women. [...] These effects are essentially observed because the categories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>emotions</b> (anger and happiness) are more closely associated with other features of these specific genders.|$|R

40|$|Although both {{auditory}} {{and visual}} information can influence <b>the</b> perceived <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> an individual, how these modalities contribute to <b>the</b> perceived <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> {{a crowd of}} characters was hitherto unknown. Here, we manipulated <b>the</b> ambiguity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> either a visual or auditory crowd of characters by varying the proportions of characters expressing one of two emotional states. Using an intersensory bias paradigm, unambiguous emotional information from an unattended modality was presented while participants determined <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> a crowd in an attended, but different, modality. We found that emotional information in an unattended modality can disambiguate <b>the</b> perceived <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> a crowd. Moreover, {{the size of the}} crowd had little effect on these crossmodal influences. The role of audiovisual information appears to be similar in perceiving emotion from individuals or crowds. Our findings provide novel insights into the role of multisensory influences on the perception of social information from crowds of individuals...|$|R
25|$|An {{external}} threat {{arises in}} the form of a mysterious man who is known only as the Mule. The Mule (whose real name is never revealed) is a mutant, and possesses the ability to sense and manipulate <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> others, usually creating fear and/or total devotion within his victims. He uses this ability to take over the independent systems bordering the Foundation, and has them wage a war against it. In face of this new threat, the provincial Traders join with the central Foundation leaders against the Mule, believing him to be the new Seldon crisis.|$|E
25|$|According to existentialism, {{each man}} and each woman creates the essence (meaning) of their life; {{life is not}} {{determined}} by a supernatural god or an earthly authority, one is free. As such, one's ethical prime directives are action, freedom, and decision, thus, existentialism opposes rationalism and positivism. In seeking meaning to life, the existentialist looks to where people find meaning in life, in course of which using only reason {{as a source of}} meaning is insufficient; this gives rise to <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> anxiety and dread, felt in considering one's free will, and the concomitant awareness of death. According to Jean-Paul Sartre, existence precedes essence; the (essence) of one's life arises only after one comes to existence.|$|E
25|$|Tensions {{continued}} to mount during June 1969. The soccer teams {{of the two}} nations were engaged that month in a three-game elimination match as a preliminary to the World Cup. Disturbances broke out during the first game in Tegucigalpa, but the situation got considerably worse during the second match in San Salvador. Honduran fans were roughed up, the Honduran flag and national anthem were insulted, and <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> both nations became considerably agitated. Actions against Salvadoran residents in Honduras, including several vice consuls, became increasingly violent. An unknown number of Salvadorans were killed or brutalized, {{and tens of thousands}} began fleeing the country. The press of both nations contributed to a growing climate of near- hysteria, and on June 27, 1969, Honduras broke diplomatic relations with El Salvador.|$|E

25|$|Reichart {{utilizes}} {{techniques in}} her novel {{that are similar}} to other Austrian authors from both the early 20th century and the early 1980s. Similar to Franz Kafka, Reichart employs alternating run-on and fragmented sentences to display <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> her character, and also creates a poignant plot by using ambiguous words which could potentially possess multiple meanings in the text. Like Ödön von Horváth, Reichart has the ability to uproot and publicly display difficult events through dramatized means. In the novels authored by Peter Handke, the use of extreme psychological activity drives the plot, which is also congruent with Reichart's novel. Her use of key themes and phrases which represent innate emotional processes can also be seen in the writings of one of her famous contemporaries, Thomas Bernhard.|$|E
25|$|Educational {{psychology}} {{research on}} motivation {{is concerned with}} the volition or will that students bring to a task, their level of interest and intrinsic motivation, the personally held goals that guide their behavior, and their belief about the causes of their success or failure. As intrinsic motivation deals with activities that act as their own rewards, extrinsic motivation deals with motivations that are brought on by consequences or punishments. A form of attribution theory developed by Bernard Weiner describes how students' beliefs about the causes of academic success or failure affect their emotions and motivations. For example, when students attribute failure to lack of ability, and ability is perceived as uncontrollable, they experience <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> shame and embarrassment and consequently decrease effort and show poorer performance. In contrast, when students attribute failure to lack of effort, and effort is perceived as controllable, they experience the emotion of guilt and consequently increase effort and show improved performance.|$|E
25|$|Along the {{way they}} find Patrick Danville, a young man imprisoned by someone who calls himself Joe Collins but is really a psychic vampire named Dandelo. Dandelo feeds off <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> his victims, and starts to feed off of Roland and Susannah by telling them jokes. Roland and Susannah are alerted to the danger by Stephen King, who drops clues {{directly}} into the book, enabling them to defeat the vampire. They discover Patrick in the basement, and find that Dandelo had removed his tongue. Patrick is freed and soon his special talent becomes evident: his drawings and paintings become reality. As their travels bring them nearer to the Dark Tower, Susannah comes {{to the conclusion that}} Roland needs to complete his journey without her. Susannah asks Patrick to draw a door she has seen in her dreams to lead her out of this world. He does so and once it appears, Susannah says goodbye to Roland and crosses over to another world.|$|E

30|$|Third, we also {{contribute}} to the envy research. Existing literature has explored many intra-person inducers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> envy such as Machiavellianism (Vecchio, 2005). Our study provides new empirical evidence that interpersonal comparison could trigger <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> envy as well. This is especially important for the study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roles <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> in <b>the</b> interpersonal interaction process, where emotions are experienced more intensely. More importantly, we show that personalities (e.g., agreeableness) could function as a crucial boundary condition for turning emotions (e.g., envy) into behaviors (e.g., ostracize others), providing a more comprehensive understanding <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> in <b>the</b> workplace.|$|R

25|$|February Shadows {{contains}} several non-traditional literary {{devices that}} became popular in Austrian {{literature in the}} 1980s in novels that dealt with subject matter relating to World War II, and especially Austria's participation in the war. Reichart utilizes these unconventional devices to illustrate Hilde's denial of pain and her struggle to remain emotionally stable. The use of fragmented sentences allows the reader to understand Hilde's inability and refusal to connect one idea to another as she attempts to repress memories. The truncated thoughts represented by the short and incomplete sentences display her own prohibition to remember the past coherently. Even Reichart's incorrect punctuation enhances <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> the story. Reichart often places periods {{in the middle of}} sentences, creating sharp and abrupt stops to ideas, as if Hilde is trying to smother her own thoughts. Reichart also ends interrogatives without question marks as if Hilde is hopelessly inquiring and does not expect to receive an answer.|$|E
25|$|Another {{reason for}} the differing views of Catholics and certain Protestants on concupiscence is their {{position}} on sin in general. Certain Protestants (for instance the magisterial reformers) hold that one can be guilty of sin {{even if it is}} not voluntary; The Catholic Church, by contrast, traditionally has held that one is guilty of sin only when the sin is voluntary. The Scholastics and magisterial reformers have different views on the issue of what is voluntary and what is not: the Catholic Scholastics considered <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> love, hate, like and dislike to be acts of will or choice, while the early Protestant reformers did not. By the Catholic position that one's attitudes are acts of will, sinful attitudes are voluntary. By the magisterial reformer view that these attitudes are involuntary, some sins are involuntary as well. Since human nature (and therefore concupiscence) is not voluntarily chosen, the Catholic Church does not teach that it is sinful; some Protestants believe that, since some sins are involuntary, it can be.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{emotions}} and states {{tend to be}} felt {{in the initial stages}} of infidelity whenever the faithful partner is alone or left alone by the suspected unfaithful one. Cognitive {{emotions and}} responses are that of those in which an individual anticipates them (Miller, 2017). Jealousy may become cognitive whenever an individual begins to process what their partner is out doing or what they see in the person they are cheating with that they don’t see in them. Resentment and the feeling of incompetence take on the cognitive state in the initial stages when the individual begins to recognize and feel that nothing they do or say will be good enough or just enough to get the infidelity suspicious to cease. Anger takes on cognitive emotional traits whenever the accuser notices and realizes why they are feeling so angry and the accused is confronted with it. Like previously stated, the initial stages of cheating are when it cannot be proven by the suspicious partner. Once couples begin to anticipate the actions and emotions of their partners, even if evidence have not been set forth, <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> infidelity enter a cognitive state.|$|E

40|$|Although <b>the</b> {{perception}} <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> {{in individuals}} {{is an important}} social skill, very {{little is known about}} how emotion is determined from a crowd of individuals. We investigated <b>the</b> perception <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> in scenes <b>of</b> crowds populated by dynamic characters each expressing an emotion. Facial expressions were masked in these characters and emotion was conveyed using body motion and posture only. We systematically varied the proportion of characters in each scene depicting one <b>of</b> two <b>emotions</b> and participants were required to categorise <b>the</b> overall <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowd. In Experiment 1, we found that <b>the</b> perception <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> in a crowd is efficient even with relatively brief exposures of the crowd stimuli. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> a crowd was generally determined by the relative proportions of characters conveying it, although we also found that some emotions dominated perception. In Experiment 2, we found that an increase in crowd size was not associated with a relative decrease in the efficiency with which <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> was categorised. Our findings suggest that body motion is an important social cue in perceiving <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> crowds and have implications for our understanding of how we perceive social information from groups...|$|R
