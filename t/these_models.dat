5|$|An {{idea of the}} {{complexity}} of the metabolic networks in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes. However, it is now possible to use this genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models that may explain and predict their behavior. <b>These</b> <b>models</b> are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on gene expression from proteomic and DNA microarray studies. Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has now been produced, which will guide future drug discovery and biochemical research. <b>These</b> <b>models</b> are now used in network analysis, to classify human diseases into groups that share common proteins or metabolites.|$|E

5|$|Early {{decompression}} theory generally {{assumed that}} inert gas bubble {{formation in the}} tissues could be avoided during decompression, and {{the aim of the}} decompression tables and algorithms was to prevent bubble formation while minimising decompression time. Most dissolved phase models are perfusion limited, and differ mainly by the number of compartments, the range of half-times, and supersaturation tolerances assumed. <b>These</b> <b>models</b> are commonly referred to as Haldanean.|$|E
5|$|In 1815, Sir Francis Ronalds (1788-1873) of London {{published}} {{the forerunner of}} the electric clock, the electrostatic clock.

5|$|Studies on induced animal {{models of}} human diseases. Here, an animal is treated {{so that it}} {{develops}} pathology and symptoms that resemble a human disease. Examples include restricting {{blood flow to the}} brain to induce stroke, or giving neurotoxins that cause damage similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease. Such studies can be difficult to interpret, and it is argued that they are not always comparable to human diseases. For example, although such models are now widely used to study Parkinson's disease, the British anti-vivisection interest group BUAV argues that <b>these</b> <b>models</b> only superficially resemble the disease symptoms, without the same time course or cellular pathology. In contrast, scientists assessing the usefulness of animal models of Parkinson's disease, as well as the medical research charity The Parkinson's Appeal, state that <b>these</b> <b>models</b> were invaluable and that they led to improved surgical treatments such as pallidotomy, new drug treatments such as levodopa, and later deep brain stimulation.|$|E
