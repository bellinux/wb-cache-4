5|$|In {{describing}} the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's {{philosophy of the}} sensations, which argued that the senses were the origin of ideas. Information described {{in the beginning of}} the poem is reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end of the poem is connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of the poem deals with the senses and the ending describes how we are limited in our ability to understand the world. The poem takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to be content with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of the poem knows that he is unable <b>to</b> <b>fathom</b> the universe, but still questions the matter.|$|E
5|$|The {{second factor}} which {{contributed to the}} {{destruction}} of the ARVN 2nd Brigade, II Corps Tactical Zone, was the inability of South Vietnamese commanders to coordinate the withdrawal. In the process of pulling out from the Central Highlands, large numbers of South Vietnamese soldiers and heavy military equipment were stretched out along the narrow corridor of Route 7. Behind the military formation were huge numbers of South Vietnamese civilians who were relatives of the military personnel, as well as government officials and their families. Unfortunately for the South Vietnamese soldiers on the ground, their army simply lacked the logistical system required to maintain the element of secrecy, which South Vietnamese commanders had hoped would enable them to pull out from the region without drawing too much attention from the North Vietnamese. It is hard <b>to</b> <b>fathom</b> how South Vietnamese commanders hoped to move 400,000 civilians in utmost secrecy. So when North Vietnamese forces attacked the South Vietnamese column along Route 7, there was little South Vietnamese commanders could do to prevent the destruction of their units.|$|E

25|$|The {{splitting}} {{of empire}} and {{the adoption of}} Christianity had many cultural consequences. Considerations of comfort aside, the toga was firmly associated with the old order and the old religion. The pallium was simple, practical, and easy to wear; {{it had always been}} considered the dress of philosophers. For those who professed allegiance to Christ and the new, Christian order, it seemed a more fitting formal garment than the toga. While the beleaguered Western emperor Honorius tried to impose the toga on his subjects in defence of Roman values, the Theodosian Lex Vestiaria of 382 had already acknowledged the toga's obsolescence in the Eastern empire, which centred on Constantinople. Equites were now expected to wear the pallium, and senators the paenula, as their proper public dress. Byzantine art and portraiture show the highest functionaries of court, church and state in magnificently wrought, extravagantly exclusive court dress and priestly robes; the underlying construction of these pictured garments is difficult <b>to</b> <b>fathom,</b> but some at least are thought to be much-mutated versions of the Imperial toga. In the early European kingdoms that replaced Roman government in the West, kings and aristocrats alike dressed like the late Roman generals they sought to emulate, rather than the toga-clad senators of ancient tradition.|$|E

[...] Most have not delved six feet beneath the surface, nor leaped as many above it. [...] We know not where we are."

Both magazines found the meaning of the lyrics difficult <b>to</b> <b>fathom.</b> Rolling Stone writer Teri Moris applauded the album's 'rockier' moments but discerned a move away from the genre, finding it [...] "the thoughtfully professional effort of a style-conscious artist whose ability to write and perform demanding rock & roll exists comfortably alongside his fascination for diverse forms... while there's little doubt about his skill, one wonders how long he'll continue wrestling with rock at all". Circus, noting that Bowie was [...] "never one to maintain continuity in his work or in his life", declared that Station to Station [...] "offers cryptic, expressionistic glimpses that let us feel the contours and palpitations of the masquer's soul but never fully reveal his face." [...] The review also found various allusions to earlier Bowie efforts, such as the [...] "density" [...] of The Man Who Sold the World, the [...] "pop feel" [...] of Hunky Dory, the [...] "dissonance and angst" [...] of Aladdin Sane, the [...] "compelling percussion" [...] of Young Americans, and the [...] "youthful mysticism" [...] of [...] "Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud", concluding that [...] "it shows Bowie pulling out on the most challenging leg of his winding journey".|$|E
500|$|Amlaíb, {{who died}} some four decades later in 980 or 981 whilst in [...] "religious retirement" [...] on Iona, was succeeded by Maccus mac Arailt, who was {{probably}} his nephew. Maccus's brother Gofraid mac Arailt then succeeded him. During their lifetimes these two [...] "sons of Harald" [...] {{are known to}} have launched at least two major expeditions against Ireland, and the latter is recorded as having won [...] "the battle of Man" [...] in 987. Iona was sacked twice, in 986 and 987, Amlaíb Cuarán's later piety notwithstanding. This battle of Man, recorded by the Annals of Ulster, {{is said to have been}} won by Gofraid and [...] "the Danes"– possibly forces directly from Scandinavia under the command of Olaf Tryggvason. The Annals of Ulster record Gofraid's death in Dalriada in 989, describing him as [...] "king of Innse Gall" [...] although it is not clear if this was a completely new term or had originally been used earlier, perhaps to refer to Amlaíb Cuarán's island kingdom. The complex geography of western Scotland and the lack of written records makes certainty about the extent and nature of these kingdoms hard <b>to</b> <b>fathom.</b> For example, the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba indicates that almost all these kings who reigned from the mid-10th to the late 11th century were buried on Iona. This may mean that Iona and Mull lay either within or close to the emerging Kingdom of Scotland. Furthermore, two records in the Annals of Innisfallen hint that the Western Isles may not have been [...] "organised into a kingdom or earldom" [...] at this time but rather that they were [...] "ruled by assemblies of freeholders who regularly elected lawmen to preside over their public affairs".|$|E
