25|$|In many Gnostic systems, God {{is known}} as the Monad, the One. God is the high source of the pleroma, the region of light. The various emanations of God are called æons. According to Hippolytus, this view was {{inspired}} by the Pythagoreans, who called the first <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>came</b> into existence the Monad, which begat the dyad, which begat the numbers, which begat the point, begetting lines, etc.|$|E
25|$|Back in the 1940s {{there were}} many members {{that were in the}} military. During that time period it was not easy for all of the members to get {{together}} for meetings because of gas rationing. On May 27 and 28, 1944 the first formal convention was held. This meeting was led by Jane Farrow and Jo Folden in Columbus, Ohio. The first Regional Meeting was held later that year in Plainfield, New Jersey. From this came the decision on the colors and the logo for Motor Maids. It was decided that royal blue and silver gray would make up the colors and a shield would represent the logo. Another <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>came</b> from this meeting was the uniform for the group. At the start the uniforms were tailor-made of silver-gray gabardine with royal blue piping. This soon changed and the uniform became gray slacks, royal blue over-blouse with white boots, and a tie. Down the road in 2006, the group voted to change the uniform again. It was then changed to what it is in present day. It consists of black pants and boots, royal blue mock neck long sleeved shirt with a white cotton vest, and white gloves. White gloves were added in 1941 when Howard Foley went to the motor maids with the idea of parading at the Charity Newsies Race. During this parade, the Motor Maids wore white gloves making them known as the “Ladies of the White Gloves”. They continued to parade for this event each year up until 1979. The Motor Maids are required to wear royal blue mock turtleneck and white cotton vest, jet-black slacks, and clean black footwear. For parades white gloves are added. The rest are required at a convention for the parade, formal group picture, and banquet.|$|E

500|$|... "S" [...] {{was written}} by Ester Dean in {{collaboration}} with the song's producers, Stargate and Sandy Vee. Dean explained its conception and the sexually suggestive lyrics to Gail Mitchell of Billboard: [...] "The first <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>came</b> to me was 'Come on, come on.' I'm thinking, 'I don't know what in the hell this is about to be.' And I remembered I'd seen something that said, 'Sticks and stones may break my bones.' Then came 'But chains and whips excite me.' When people have a great track that speaks to me, it feels like it already has a story in it". Rihanna told Rolling Stone about her interest in bondage and other sadomasochism activities, themes central to [...] "S": [...] "I like to take charge, but I love to be submissive... being submissive in the bedroom is really fun. You get to be a little lady, to have somebody be macho and in charge." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sources are}} {{inconsistent}} regarding {{the extent of}} the persecution in Constantius's domain, though all portray it as quite limited. Lactantius states that the destruction of church buildings was the worst <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>came</b> to pass. Eusebius explicitly denies that any churches were destroyed in both his Ecclesiastical History and his Life of Constantine, but lists Gaul as an area suffering from the effects of the persecution in his Martyrs of Palestine. A group of bishops declared that [...] "Gaul was immune" [...] (immunis est Gallia) from the persecutions under Constantius. The death of Saint Alban, the first British Christian martyr, was once dated to this era, but most now assign it to the reign of Septimius Severus. The second, third and fourth edicts seem not to have been enforced in the West at all. It is possible that Constantius's relatively tolerant policies were the result of Tetrarchic jealousies; the persecution, after all, had been the project of the Eastern emperors, not the Western ones. After Constantine succeeded his father in 306, he urged the recovery of Church property lost in the persecution, and legislated full freedom for all Christians in his domain.|$|E

The writing staff wrote the episode specifically for Knoxville. Executive producer Paul Tibbitt said [...] " [...] wanted to do a show about extreme sports and the first <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>came</b> to mind was Johnny Knoxville, because there are few humans living that are as extreme as him." [...] Knoxville accepted the role because he is a fan of the show. Knoxville said [...] "I got a lot of street cred in the office for doing SpongeBob. Everyone is psyched As soon as I was done recording this episode, I started begging them to let me come back and record another one." [...] Knoxville asked if he needed {{to come up with a}} funny voice for his character. However, the producers said [...] "No, we want [...]" [...] Knoxville claimed that [...] "it's not easy" [...] providing a vocal cameo. He added [...] "It's a different kind of work." ...|$|E

While listening {{to the music of}} [...] "But", the first <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>came</b> to Koda's mind was homosexuality. Regarding the theme of homosexuality, Koda said in an interview: [...] "I'm {{the type of person who}} thinks that [...] it doesn't matter what sex the other person is. No matter who they are, it doesn't change the 'I love this person' feeling, does it?" [...] The video for [...] "Taboo" [...] portrayed homosexuality and other [...] "taboo" [...] subjects to deliver Koda's message of [...] "there really is no such thing as a taboo". [...] She also said of [...] "Taboo"'s themes, [...] "Instead of trying stuff out and experiencing it, we put up a 'No' sign, we never try to break the taboos" [...] and [...] "Sometimes we shouldn't retreat into safety, we should have courage to do things. Those are the feelings kin the song." [...] Such themes are also present in her music videos: she has incorporated her [...] "sexy" [...] image into her videos since [...] "Crazy 4 U" [...] through sexually charged dances and skin-baring outfits. The video of [...] "Ima Sugu Hoshii" [...] featured two males in sexual positions, and the video of [...] "Juicy", which also featured sexual posturing, was censored in Taiwan.|$|E
500|$|Swift and Liz Rose wrote [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] during Swift's {{freshman}} year at Hendersonville High School. She conceived the idea {{in the midst of}} her mathematics class: [...] "I was just sitting there, and I started humming this melody." [...] She then related the melody to a predicament she was encountering at the moment. Swift knew that she and her senior boyfriend would break {{up at the end of}} the year when he left for college. In order to cope with the complicated emotions she was experiencing, Swift wrote the song. Rose said Swift showed up at her after school job, writing songs for Sony/ATV Music, [...] "with the idea and the melody, knowing exactly what she wanted." [...] She desired for the song to capture the sweetness and sadness of loving and losing someone. It was written about all the different things that would remind the subject of Swift and their time spent together, once he departed. [...] "To her surprise, the first <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>came</b> to mind was [...] love of Tim McGraw's music." [...] Several personal details were listed for the song. McGraw's mentioning was a reference to Swift's favorite song, [...] "Can't Tell Me Nothin" [...] from his 2004 album Live Like You Were Dying, rather than McGraw as a person. The writing process, as with [...] "Our Song", took place in approximately twenty minutes, and was executed with the use of a piano.|$|E
500|$|Drake then {{contacted}} Songz, who {{had been}} working with Drake back since 2007 on mixtapes. Songz said that Drake originally called him on advice of segueing his singing into rapping on interludes, then the terms of what records he would be featured on the mixtape, as he sent him the [...] "Successful" [...] track. After Drake still could not settle on the direction for the track, Songz came up with the his hook. He explained to MTV News, [...] "The first <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>came</b> to mind was 'I want the money, money and the cars/ Cars and the clothes/ The ho's/ I suppose I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful.' When I'm saying all that, conceptually for me, the deepest part of the record was when I say, 'I suppose.' I supposed that's what success is about. That's what [...] led to believe." [...] After hearing the hook, Drake called it [...] "powerful", commenting, [...] "And it's like, it's almost like it made me feel like it may not be right what I want, you know? All these things, it's like it made me feel young. It kind of made me feel ignorant to the game. But it was an exciting record even though the tempo is slow. That's what I want... The 'I suppose' moment in there is like, it's almost like you're doubting yourself for a second. But {{at the end of the}} day, I just want to be successful. So that's what the record meant to me." ...|$|E

500|$|Author Yoshihiro Togashi {{stated that}} he began working on Yu Yu Hakusho {{during a period of}} time around November 1990, though he forgot the exact time. As a fan of the occult and horror films, he desired to write and {{illustrate}} a manga based on his interests. Togashi had previously published an occult detective fiction manga titled Occult Tanteidan, of which he referenced positive reception from readers as a reason for continuing to create manga. When first producing Yu Yu Hakusho, {{he did not have a}} clear idea of what he wanted to call it. He used the tentative title [...] "How to be a Ghost" [...] while presenting rough drafts to his editors. Once given the go-ahead to begin publication, Togashi proposed [...] "YuYu-Ki (Poltergeist Chronicles)" [...] for the title, as there would be battles with demons and it would be a play on the title SaiYu-Ki. Because a series with a similar name (Chin-Yu-Ki) had already begun publication, Togashi quickly created an alternative: [...] "YuYu Hakusho (Poltergeist Report)". He commented that he could have used [...] "Den (Legend)" [...] or [...] "Monogatari (Story)", but [...] "Hakusho (Report)" [...] was the first <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>came</b> to his mind. He contiguously developed the names of the main characters by skimming through a dictionary and taking out kanji characters he found appealing. [...] "Yusuke Urameshi" [...] is a pun, [...] "Kazuma Kuwabara" [...] is a combination of two professional baseball players, and [...] "Hiei" [...] and [...] "Kurama" [...] are [...] "just names that popped into [...] head". When he introduced the latter two characters in volume three, the author had early plans to make Kurama a main character but was not certain about Hiei.|$|E

2500|$|Their writing style, as they {{described}} it, {{was to write}} down the first <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>came</b> into their heads, lifting words and phrases from the Concise Oxford Dictionary, a Collected Shakespeare, and a Dictionary of Quotations: [...] "We opened books at random, choosing a word or phrase haphazardly. We made lists of these and wove them in nonsensical sentences. We misquoted and made false allusions. We deliberately perpetrated bad verse, and selected awkward rhymes from a Ripman's Rhyming Dictionary." [...] They also included many bits of their own poetry, though in a deliberately disjointed manner.|$|E

Then, Tsunku who saw this eating played [...] "she's going out to the head family (Ganzo! Ōkui-ō)", and it lead to her appearance in Ganzo! Ōkui-ō.|$|E
2500|$|Heavy Rain {{director}} David Cage {{described the}} game as [...] "a very dark film noir thriller with mature themes" [...] without any supernatural elements, and that [...] "the real message [...] is about how far you're {{willing to go to}} save someone you love." [...] In 2008, Cage gave a brief overview of the game's narrative and ambitions: [...] "Heavy Rain is about normal people who have landed in extraordinary situations. I wanted a much more personal story. The first <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>came</b> to my mind, as a father of two little boys, was that the main theme should simply be a father's love for his son. This is not a game about saving the princess or the world. Its [...] purely about a father's love. The main story will revolve around four different characters, and we're putting the spotlight on their perceptions. The question 'what is good and what is evil' is the key here, that will be just a matter of viewpoint...I believe heavily in moral choices, I'm going to use them A LOT. They're not about being good or bad, but about finding the right balance." [...] Cage commented on the setting by saying, [...] "I don't want to do a big free-roaming city like GTA, because the flow of the story will then be hard to control. Nevertheless, I do want to incorporate big sets, with a crowd, heavy populated areas like a mall and a subway {{are going to be in}} there. Of course, the gameplay has got to make use of that aspect too." [...] Cage also stated that the game's storyline and themes was heavily influenced by the 2006-2010 science fiction psychological thriller television series, Heroes.|$|E
