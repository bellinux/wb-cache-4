40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} {{study was to examine}} the association of cortisol levels to exertional perception and exercise induced changes in affect during a bout of exercise. It was expected that increased levels of salivary cortisol would be associated with a negative shift in affect in response to a submaximal and maximal <b>treadmill</b> <b>test.</b> It was also hypothesized that increased levels of salivary cortisol levels would be associated with an increased perception of exertion during a submaximal and maximal <b>treadmill</b> <b>test.</b> Males and females between 27 and 35 years of age (n= 33) were recruited to participate in this study. Salivary cortisol was assessed at baseline, 5 minutes after the submaximal <b>treadmill</b> <b>test,</b> 5 minutes after the maximal <b>treadmill</b> <b>test,</b> and 30 minutes after the maximal <b>treadmill</b> <b>test.</b> Affect was measured using the Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score of the Profile of Mood Scale (POMS). The greater the TMD scores, the more negative the mood. Affect was measured at baseline, 5 minutes after the submaximal <b>treadmill</b> <b>test,</b> 5 minutes after the maximal <b>treadmill</b> <b>test,</b> and 30 minutes after the maximal <b>treadmill</b> <b>test.</b> Perceived exertion (RPE) was measured using the OMNI Scale of Perceived Exertion. Final RPE for legs, chest and breathing, and overall body was assessed during the final minute of the submaximal <b>treadmill</b> <b>test,</b> and immediately at the end of the maximal <b>treadmill</b> <b>test.</b> Session RPE was assessed 5 minutes after the cessation of both the submaximal and maximal <b>treadmill</b> <b>test.</b> Partial correlations were conducted to examine the association between cortisol values, affect, and RPE. Results indicated there was a positive correlation between cortisol values and negative affect. This association was found only in males and the correlation was strongest in both the change in cortisol levels from baseline to 5 minutes and 30 minutes after the maximal <b>treadmill</b> <b>test</b> and the change in affect from baseline to 5 minutes after the maximal <b>treadmill</b> <b>test.</b> Final RPE assessed for the maximal <b>treadmill</b> <b>test</b> was positively correlated with cortisol levels 30 minutes after maximal <b>treadmill</b> <b>test.</b> This correlation was found only in females. There appears to be evidence that increased cortisol levels post exercise are associated with a negative mood shift following a maximal <b>treadmill</b> <b>test</b> and higher perceived exertion during a maximal <b>treadmill</b> <b>test.</b> Future examination of the association among cortisol levels, affect, and perceived exertion during exercise is warranted. Examining the physiological and psychological responses to exercise may assist with the development of better strategies that will help increase exercise adaptation and adherence...|$|E

Initial claudicating distance and maximal walking distance were determined from the <b>treadmill</b> <b>test.</b> Comparisons were made between the <b>treadmill</b> <b>test</b> and the DPWT. Results: the <b>treadmill</b> <b>test</b> was unable to be performed in 22 % of patients due to defined contraindications.

40|$|ObjectiveAssessment {{of walking}} {{distance}} by <b>treadmill</b> <b>testing</b> {{is the most}} commonly used method to evaluate the effect of treatment in patients with peripheral arterial disease. However, <b>treadmill</b> <b>testing</b> is time consuming, relatively expensive, and does not adequately reflect real life functional ability. We hypothesized that the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) could be an alternative tool to assess objective improvement in functional walking ability of patients with intermittent claudication. MethodsThis was a validation study. It was conducted through the outpatient clinic for vascular surgery. Patients with intermittent claudication were referred for supervised exercise therapy. <b>Treadmill</b> <b>testing</b> (absolute claudication distance [ACD]), WIQ, and quality of life questionnaires (RAND- 36 and EuroQol) were administered at study onset and after 3 months of supervised exercise therapy. Responsiveness was determined by mean changes in and correlation coefficients of WIQ, ACD, and quality of life questionnaires. Patients were categorized into quartiles based on the increase in ACD, which were subsequently related to change in WIQ and quality of life. ResultsThe mean pre- and post-treatment total WIQ scores of 91 patients were 0. 45 (0. 22) and 0. 58 (0. 22), respectively. The correlation coefficient between the change in total WIQ score and ACD was 0. 331 (P =. 004). A 0. 1 change in total WIQ score corresponded to a change of 345 meters in ACD. Analysis of the four quartiles compared to an increase in ACD showed that a greater increase in ACD corresponded with a greater increase in WIQ score, from 0. 06 to 0. 25 (P =. 011). ConclusionThese data indicate that the WIQ is a valid tool to detect improvement or deterioration in the daily walking ability of patients with intermittent claudication. Hence, the WIQ can be used as an alternative to <b>treadmill</b> <b>testing</b> for objective assessment of functional walking ability, both in daily practice and in clinical trials...|$|R

However, whether these tests are correlated remain poorly known. Objective: To analyze the relationship between total walking distance (TWD) obtained in six-minute walk test and <b>treadmill</b> <b>test</b> in patients with peripheral artery disease and symptoms of intermittent claudication. Methods: Thirty-four patients (65. 5 ± 8. 9 years) of both genders (26 men and 8 women) participated of the study.

40|$|Objectives. This study {{compared}} {{the effects of}} amlodipine, atenolol and their combination on ischemia during <b>treadmill</b> <b>testing</b> and 48 -h ambulatory monitoring. Background. It is not known whether anti-ischemic drugs exert similar effects on ischemia during ambulatory monitoring and exercise <b>treadmill</b> <b>testing.</b> Methods. Patients with stable coronary artery disease and ischemia during <b>treadmill</b> <b>testing</b> and ambulatory monitoring were randomized to receive amlodipine (n = 51) or atenolol (n = 49). Each group underwent a counterbalanced, crossover evaluation of single drug and placebo, followed by evaluation of the combination. Results. Amlodipine and the combination prolonged exercise time to 0. 1 -mV ST segment depression by 29 % and 34 %, respectively (p < 0. 001) versus 3 % for atenolol (p = NS). During ambulatory monitoring, the frequency of ischemic episodes decreased by 28 % with amlodipine (p = 0. 083 [NS]), by 57 % with atenolol (p < 0. 001) and by 72 % with the combination (p < 0. 05 vs. both single drugs; p < 0. 001 vs. placebo). Suppression of ischemia during exercise testing and ambulatory monitoring was similar in patients with and without exercise-induced angina. Exercise time to angina improved by 29 % with amlodipine (p < 0. 01), by 16 % with atenolol (p < 0. 05) and by 39 % with the combination (p < 0. 005 vs. placebo, atenolol and amlodipine).

BackgroundStudies have highlighted the value of a new prognostic feature of the treadmill test—rate of recovery of HR after exercise. These studies have had differing as well as controversial results and did not consider diagnostic test characteristics. MethodsAll patients were referred for evaluation of chest pain at two university-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Centers who underwent <b>treadmill</b> <b>tests</b> and coronary angiography between 1987 and 1999 as predicted after a mean seven years of follow-up. All-cause mortality was the end point for follow-up, and coronary angiography was the diagnostic gold standard. ResultsThere were 2, 193 male patients who had <b>treadmill</b> <b>tests</b> and coronary angiography. Heart rate recovery at 2 min after exercise outperformed other time points in prediction of death; a decrease of < 22 beats/min had a hazard ratio of 2. 6 (2. 4 to 2. 8 95 % confidence interval). This new measurement was ranked similarly to traditional variables including age and metabolic equivalents but failed to have diagnostic power for discriminating those who had angiographic disease.

We determined the diagnostic and prognostic value of the DTS in 976 women and 2, 249 men who underwent both <b>treadmill</b> <b>testing</b> and cardiac catheterization in a single institution from 1984 to 1994. Results. Women and men differed significantly in DTS (1. 6 vs. − 0. 3, p < 0. 0001), disease prevalence (32 % vs. 72 % significant coronary artery disease [CAD], p < 0. 001), and 2 -year mortality (1. 9 % vs. 4. 9 %, p < 0. 0001). The DTS provided information beyond clinical predictors of both coronary disease and survival in women and men. Although overall women had better survival, the DTS performed equally well in stratifying both genders into prognostic categories. The DTS actually performed better in women than in men for excluding disease, with fewer low risk women having any significant coronary disease (≥ 1 vessel with ≥ 75 % stenosis) (20 % vs. 47 %, p < 0. 001), or severe disease (3 -vessel disease or ≥ 75 % left main stenosis) (3. 5 % vs. 11. 4 %, p < 0. 001).

Subjects reported either dyspnea or leg fatigue during each test. Oxygen consumption (V?O 2), ventilation (V?E), respiratory rate (f R) and heart rate (HR) were measured during each test. Results V?O 2, V?E, HR, dyspnea and leg fatigue {{were not significantly different}} among the three exercise conditions (p > 0. 05). Conclusion These findings indicate that at equivalent levels of cardiopulmonary stress reflected by similar levels of V?O 2 and heart rate, the perceived level of exertional dyspnea is not influenced by different patterns of neuromuscular activity. Similarly, the intensity of leg fatigue primarily reflects whole body work and is independent of different patterns of neuromuscular activity. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|A 41 -year-old {{man with}} no {{relevant}} cardiac history presented for evaluation of episodic syncope. Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block and Q waves in leads II, III, and aVF. Subsequent exercise <b>treadmill</b> <b>testing</b> and technetium 99 m sestamibi study revealed a reversible posterior defect. Coronary angiography later showed a right coronary artery that arose from the left coronary sinus—an anomaly that {{has been associated with}} angina, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the present study}} were twofold: 1) to determine the physical working capacity at the fatigue threshold (PWCFT) during an incremental <b>treadmill</b> <b>test,</b> and 2) to examine the validity of this fatigue threshold through constant-velocity runs to exhaustion at 90, 100, and 110 % of the estimated PWCFT. Twelve aerobically-trained males (mean age±SD= 24. 6 ± 5. 4 years, running volume= 69. 9 ± 46. 0 km·wk- 1, n= 9) and females (22. 3 ± 2. 3 years, 45. 6 ± 4. 6 km·wk- 1, n= 3) volunteered to perform a <b>treadmill</b> <b>test</b> to exhaustion with electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded from the m. vastus lateralis on four separate visits. The First visit required each subject to complete an incremental <b>treadmill</b> <b>test</b> to exhaustion for determination of their PWCFT. During the second, third, and fourth visit, the subjects completed a treadmill run to exhaustion at a constant velocity that corresponded to 90, 100, or 110 % of their PWCFT in random order. The linear regression analyses indicated there were no significant (p>. 05) changes in muscle activation (i. e. EMG amplitude) across time to exhaustion during the constant velocity runs at 90 % (60. 00 ± 0. 00 min) and 100 % (48. 86 ± 14. 59 min) PWCFT, but significant (p<. 05) increases occurred at 110 % PWCFT (19. 44 ± 10. 26 min). Thus, the findings of the present study indicated that the PWCFT <b>treadmill</b> <b>test</b> was able to accurately estimate the fastest running velocity that could be maintained {{for an extended period of}} time without evidence of neuromuscular fatigue...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the construct validity of self-reported historical walking, running, and jogging (WRJ) activity. The criterion measure was concurrent performance on a maximal <b>treadmill</b> <b>test.</b> Subjects completed a medical exam and <b>treadmill</b> <b>test</b> between the years 1976 and 1985, and completed a follow-up questionnaire in 1986. Questionnaire included an item that assessed WRJ for each year from 1976 through 1985. Data analysis included Spearman correlations, partial correlations, ANOVA, and ANCOVA. Results indicated self-reported historical WRJ can be assessed with reasonable validity when compared with concurrently measured treadmill performance, and there is no decay in the accuracy of this reporting for up to ten years in the past...|$|E
40|$|Lumbar spinal {{stenosis}} {{is a frequent}} indication for spinal surgery. The predictive quality of treadmill testing and MRI for diagnostic verification is not yet clearly defined. Aim {{of the current study}} was to assess correlations between treadmill testing and MRI findings in the lumbar spine. Twenty-five patients with lumbar {{spinal stenosis}} were prospectively examined. Treadmill tests were performed and the area of the dural sac and neuroforamina was examined with MRI for the narrowest spinal segment. VAS and ODI were used for clinical assessment. The median age of the patients was 67  years. In the narrowest spinal segment the median area of the dural sac was 91  mm 2. The median ODI was 66 per cent. The median walking distance in the <b>treadmill</b> <b>test</b> was 70  m. The distance reached in the <b>treadmill</b> <b>test</b> correlated with the area of the dural sac (Spearman’s ρ =  0. 53) and ODI (ρ = − 0. 51), but not with the area of the neuroforamina and VAS. The distance reached in the <b>treadmill</b> <b>test</b> predicts the grade of stenosis in MRI but has a limited diagnostic importance for the level of clinical symptoms in lumbar spinal stenosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} acute blood lactate concentration, heart rate, blood pressure, and rating of perceived exertion following two different types of exercise: a high intensity power training exercise test and a graded <b>treadmill</b> exercise <b>test.</b> The hypothesis was that the HIPT exercise test would yield higher levels of blood lactate, heart rate, blood pressure, and RPE, immediately post exercise when compared to a graded <b>treadmill</b> exercise <b>test.</b> Ten college-aged participants with a body mass index /m 2, blood pressure 3 ̆c 140 / 90 mmHg, no overt cardiovascular disease, no cardiovascular medications, and no use of tobacco products were included in the study. All participants had a general fitness and training level that allowed them to perform the exercise bouts without any hesitation. Subjects participated in two exercise sessions on separate occasions. A graded <b>treadmill</b> exercise <b>test</b> occurred with the subjects walking on the treadmill until the self-stated desire to stop or until five stages of increased speed and intensity had occurred. In the second meeting, subjects completed a prescribed high-intensity power training exercise test. Heart rate (HR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), blood pressure (BP), and blood lactate concentration were all obtained before and immediately following each training session, as well as immediately following each stage of the graded <b>treadmill</b> exercise <b>test.</b> Oxygen uptake was obtained during the graded <b>treadmill</b> exercise <b>test.</b> After both tests were conducted, the high intensity power training exercise test showed a higher percentage of blood lactate concentration at its conclusion when compared to the graded <b>treadmill</b> exercise <b>test</b> with lower final average values BP, HR and RPE. In conclusion HIPT exercise yields higher blood lactate concentrations compared to graded treadmill exercise with a lower blood pressure, heart rate, and perceived exertion...|$|R

The full kinematics of bicycles and riders were measured with an active motion capture system. Motion across speeds are compared graphically with box and whiskers plots. Trends and ranges in amplitude are shown to characterize the system motion. This data will be used to develop a realistic biomechanical model and control model for the rider and for future experimental design...|$|R
