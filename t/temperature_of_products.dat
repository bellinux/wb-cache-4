40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} Wireless Sensor Network {{technologies}} are now available to implement real time temperature monitoring systems in food supply chains. The aim {{of this paper}} is to examine different types of methods and criteria to establish alerts in decision support systems in perishable food supply chains. Design/methodology/approach Logistic and temperature mapping was performed in cod supply chains to obtain data to establish criteria for temperature alerts. Data was collected for both ambient temperature and <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> packed in Expanded Polystyrene boxes. Findings Alerts based on single criterion for ambient temperature resulted in false alerts when compared to criteria for product temperature. More complex methods that took into account both temperature abuse and the severity of the abuse resulted in more relevant alerts for the chilled cod supply chain. Research limitations/implications The research is based on mapping of cod supply chains with a limited number of iterations. Practical implications The scope of the research is the application of WSN in an actual supply chain of chilled cod transported from Iceland to Europe, which has relevance in assisting management decision making in the supply chain to prevent losses of quality and minimize waste. What is original/value of paper Failure to maintain a low temperature occurs frequently at handover points where alert systems are usually not in place.

40|$|Background: Milk is {{considered}} one of the most important sources of nutrients. It contains proteins, fat acids, vitamins and minerals. Its activity has a significant socio-economic impact in all over the world and in Brazil. The presence of bacterial inhibitors in milk for human consumption is a great concern for the dairy products industry and public health. With regard to the production of dairy products, mainly cheeses and fermented milks, this affects the growth of starter cultures in ripening processes of cheese and fermented milk. The risks for consumer health are represented by allergic reactions, which are usually manifested as urticarias, dermatitides or rhinitis and bronchial asthma, and that can result in anaphylactic shock in susceptible individuals. Another risk to be considered is the consumption by pregnant women of milk containing high levels of antimicrobial residues, considering the teratogenic potential presented by some of them. By the other hand, milk acidity is one of the biggest problems encountered at milk processing plants and, for that reason, the control of the storage <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> and the adoption of adequate hygienic practices must be prioritized. The objective of this study was to verify the incidence of acidity and antimicrobial residues in milk, at a dairy factory from Vale do Taquari, RS. Materials, Methods & Results: Data about milk condemnation caused by the presence of antimicrobial residues and acidity were collected from the period of January 1 st, 2008 to April 2 nd, 2009. The analyses were performed at the quality control laboratory of the dairy plant. The samples came from the milk trucks at the reception platform. The Charm-test® kit was used for detection of antimicrobial residues, and acidity was determined through titration with Dornic solution. Condemnation of acid milk occurred in June, November and December 2008 and in February 2009. On the other hand, condemnation of milk due to the presence of antimicrobial residues occurred in all months studied. Discussion: High temperatures influence in the growth of mesophilic bacteria and impair the maintenance of cooling temperatures. These bacteria cause milk acidification due to the formation of lactic acid from lactose fermentation. The condemnation of acid milk in June 2008, which corresponds to winter time in the south hemisphere, gives evidence that milk acidification is caused by multiple factors, being also associated to the initial microbial load. However, condemnation of milk occurred in November and December 2008, and the largest amount of condemned milk during the whole period of study was observed in February 2009, which highlights the influence of the storage temperature on milk acidification. Condemnation of milk occurred in all months studied due to the presence of antimicrobial residues, which suggests that part of the milk destined to the industry came from animals that were under mastitis treatment or whose grace period, as established by the pharmaceutical companies, was not observed. The results highlight the necessity of specialized technical assistance for producers, in order to prevent the bacterial contamination of milk and the indiscriminate use of veterinary drugs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> {{refrigerated}} <b>products</b> {{along the}} cold chain {{must be kept}} within pre-defined limits to ensure adequate safety levels and high product quality.

Time-Temperature Indicators (TTI) are composed <b>of</b> <b>temperature</b> measurements taken at various time intervals and are used to feed analytic models that monitor the impacts <b>of</b> <b>temperature</b> on <b>product</b> quality.

Of the three methods mentioned in this article, theoretical and numerical methods {{can be used to}} determine an estimate of the heat sink or component <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> before a physical model has been made. A theoretical model is normally used as a first order estimate.

Numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provide a qualitative (and sometimes even quantitative) prediction of fluid flows. What this means is that it will give a visual or post-processed result of a simulation, like the images in figures 16 and 17, and the CFD animations in figure 18 and 19, but the quantitative or absolute accuracy of the result is sensitive to the inclusion and accuracy of the appropriate parameters.|$|R

Their {{use as a}} starter culture in vinegar manufactures in such regions could reduce considerably water cooling expenses. For optimising biomass preservation, the effect of 20 % w/w mannitol as cryoprotectant on the cells viability after freeze-drying process and during storage was evaluated. Results showed that freeze-dried cells could be conserved at 4 degrees C for at least 6 months without loss of viability. The main reasons were that cryoprotectant tends {{to lower the water}} activity (a(w)) and to maintain a <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> weaker than that of the glass transition temperature T-g. Furthermore, the heat resistance of freeze-dried cells during storage was all the more increased that strains were cryoprotected.
