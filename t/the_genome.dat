5|$|In August 2010, a {{research}} {{team led by}} Eske Willerslev, an ancient DNA expert at the University of Copenhagen, announced their intention to sequence <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> of Sitting Bull, {{with the approval of}} his descendants, using a hair sample obtained during his lifetime.|$|E
5|$|In general, RNA viruses have smaller genome sizes than DNA viruses {{because of}} a higher error-rate when replicating, and have a maximum upper size limit. Beyond this limit, errors in <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> when replicating render the virus useless or uncompetitive. To {{compensate}} for this, RNA viruses often have segmented genomes– <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> is split into smaller molecules– thus reducing the chance that an error in a single-component genome will incapacitate the entire genome. In contrast, DNA viruses generally have larger genomes {{because of the high}} fidelity of their replication enzymes. Single-strand DNA viruses are an exception to this rule, however, as mutation rates for these genomes can approach the extreme of the ssRNA virus case.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> horse <b>genome</b> {{was first}} sequenced in 2006. <b>The</b> Horse <b>Genome</b> Project mapped 2.7 billion DNA base pairs, [...] and {{released}} the full map in 2009. <b>The</b> horse <b>genome</b> {{is larger than}} <b>the</b> dog <b>genome,</b> but smaller than <b>the</b> human <b>genome</b> or <b>the</b> bovine <b>genome.</b> It encompasses 31 autosomes and two sex chromosomes.|$|R
5|$|Horses have 64 chromosomes. <b>The</b> horse <b>genome</b> was sequenced in 2007. It {{contains}} 2.7 billion DNA base pairs, {{which is}} larger than <b>the</b> dog <b>genome,</b> but smaller than <b>the</b> human <b>genome</b> or <b>the</b> bovine <b>genome.</b> <b>The</b> map is available to researchers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>genomes</b> of both Py. ultimum var. ultimum and Py. ultimum var. sporangiiferum {{have been}} sequenced. [...] Analysis of <b>the</b> <b>genomes</b> suggest that <b>the</b> two species encode 15,290 and 14,086 proteins, respectively.|$|R
5|$|Polyploidy {{appears to}} have {{enhanced}} the ability of flowering plants to survive the extinction, probably because the additional copies of <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> such plants possessed, allowed them to more readily adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions that followed the impact.|$|E
5|$|Sperm whales have 21 {{pairs of}} {{chromosomes}} (2n=42). <b>The</b> <b>genome</b> of live whales can be examined by recovering shed skin.|$|E
5|$|The Amanita Genome Project {{was begun}} in Jonathan Walton's lab at Michigan State University in 2004 {{as part of}} their ongoing studies of Amanita bisporigera. The purpose of the project is to {{determine}} the genes and genetic controls associated with the formation of mycorrhizae, and to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of toxin production. <b>The</b> <b>genome</b> of A.bisporigera has been sequenced using a combination of automated Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing, and <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> sequence information is publicly searchable. The sequence data enabled the researchers to identify the genes responsible for amatoxin and phallotoxin biosynthesis, AMA1 and PHA1. The cyclic peptides are synthesized on ribosomes, and require proline-specific peptidases from the prolyl oligopeptidase family for processing.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{genes in}} <b>the</b> <b>genomes</b> of {{mitochondria}} and chloroplasts {{have been lost}} or transferred to {{the nucleus of the}} host cell. Consequently, the chromosomes of many eukaryotes contain genes that originated from <b>the</b> <b>genomes</b> of mitochondria and plastids.|$|R
5000|$|First {{scientific}} {{findings show}} that <b>the</b> honey bee <b>genome</b> may have evolved more slowly than <b>the</b> <b>genomes</b> of <b>the</b> fruit fly and malaria mosquito. [...] <b>The</b> bee <b>genome</b> contains versions of some important mammalian genes.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{complete}} mitochondrial <b>genomes</b> were sequenced in anadromous {{and resident}} {{forms of the}} lamprey Lethenteron camtschaticum. The sizes of <b>the</b> <b>genomes</b> in <b>the</b> two isolates are 16, 245 and 16, 295 [*]bp. The gene arrangement, base composition, and size of <b>the</b> two sequenced <b>genomes</b> are similar to <b>the</b> lamprey <b>genomes</b> previously published. <b>The</b> total sequence divergence between <b>the</b> two <b>genomes</b> is very low (0. 14 %), supporting conspecificity of the anadromous and resident forms of L. camtschaticum. Comparison of <b>the</b> <b>genomes</b> sequenced in <b>the</b> present work with other genomes of lampreys available in GenBank, reveals two distinct evolutionary lineages with a genera level of divergence among the lampreys of eastern Eurasia...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>genome</b> is {{the total}} genetic {{material}} of an organism and includes both the genes and non-coding sequences.|$|E
5|$|Variation {{comes from}} {{mutations}} in <b>the</b> <b>genome,</b> reshuffling of genes through sexual reproduction and migration between populations (gene flow). Despite the constant {{introduction of new}} variation through mutation and gene flow, most of <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> of a species is identical in all individuals of that species. However, even relatively small differences in genotype can lead to dramatic differences in phenotype: for example, chimpanzees and humans differ in only about 5% of their genomes.|$|E
5|$|Viral genomes are circular, {{as in the}} polyomaviruses, or linear, as in the adenoviruses. The type of {{nucleic acid}} is {{irrelevant}} {{to the shape of}} <b>the</b> <b>genome.</b> Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid. However, all segments are not required {{to be in the same}} virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by brome mosaic virus and several other plant viruses.|$|E

50|$|Endogenous {{retrovirus}} sequences are {{the product}} of reverse transcription of retrovirus <b>genomes</b> into <b>the</b> <b>genomes</b> of germ cells. Mutation within these retro-transcribed sequences can inactivate <b>the</b> viral <b>genome.</b>|$|R
5|$|Also, {{the paucity}} of {{morphological}} differences between the Old World mallards and the New World mallard demonstrates {{the extent to which}} <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> is shared among them such that birds like the Chinese spot-billed duck are highly similar to the Old World mallard, and birds such as the Hawaiian duck are highly similar to the New World mallard.|$|E
5|$|Background {{selection}} {{is the opposite}} of a selective sweep. If a specific site experiences strong and persistent purifying selection, linked variation tends to be weeded out along with it, producing a region in <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> of low overall variability. Because background {{selection is}} a result of deleterious new mutations, which can occur randomly in any haplotype, it does not produce clear blocks of linkage disequilibrium, although with low recombination it can still lead to slightly negative linkage disequilibrium overall.|$|E
5|$|Genome size varies greatly between species. The {{smallest}} viral genomes– the ssDNA circoviruses, family Circoviridae– {{code for}} only two proteins and have a genome size of only two kilobases; the largest–the pandoraviruses–have genome sizes of around two megabases which code for about 2500 proteins. Virus genes rarely have introns and often are arranged in <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> so that they overlap.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>genomes</b> of pilus-specific, lipid-containing phages PR 4 and PR 772 {{were studied}} {{electron}} microscopically. An identical mol. wt. of IO- 9 × IO ~ was obtained. <b>The</b> <b>genomes</b> are unique (non-permuted) and have cohesive ends. From the similarities {{in size and}} denaturation maps of <b>the</b> <b>genomes</b> and failure to demon-strate non-homology in heteroduplexes, reported morphological ambiguities were clarified. The known serological difference between the phages could not be related to non-homology of their genomes. It is concluded that phages PR 4 and PR 772 are the same phage...|$|R

5|$|In as {{different}} groups as animals and trypanosomes, the mitochondria contain both stabilising and destabilising poly(A) tails. Destabilising polyadenylation targets both mRNA and noncoding RNAs. The poly(A) tails are 43 nucleotides long on average. The stabilising ones {{start at the}} stop codon, and without them the stop codon (UAA) is not complete as <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> only encodes the U or UA part. Plant mitochondria have only destabilising polyadenylation, and yeast mitochondria have no polyadenylation at all.|$|E
5|$|In ctenophores, {{bioluminescence}} {{is caused}} by the activation of calcium-activated proteins named photoproteins in cells called photocytes, which are often confined to the meridional canals that underlie the eight comb rows. In <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> of Mnemiopsis leidyi ten genes encode photoproteins. These genes are co-expressed with opsin genes in the developing photocytes of Mnemiopsis leidyi, raising the possibility that light production and light detection may be working together in these animals.|$|E
50|$|Both {{sexual and}} asexual {{reproduction}}s are implemented. Asexual reproduction is implemented as producing <b>the</b> offspring's <b>genome</b> (<b>the</b> gene network) by directly copying <b>the</b> parent's <b>genome.</b> Sexual reproduction is implemented as the recombination of <b>the</b> two parents' <b>genomes.</b>|$|R

5|$|In prokaryotes the cytosol {{contains}} the cell's genome, within a structure {{known as a}} nucleoid. This is an irregular mass of DNA and associated proteins that control the transcription and replication of the bacterial chromosome and plasmids. In eukaryotes <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> is held within the cell nucleus, which is separated from the cytosol by nuclear pores that block the free diffusion of any molecule larger than about 10nanometres in diameter.|$|E
5|$|Like DNA, RNA {{can carry}} genetic information. RNA viruses have genomes {{composed}} of RNA that encodes {{a number of}} proteins. The viral genome is replicated by some of those proteins, while other proteins protect <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> as the virus particle moves to a new host cell. Viroids are another group of pathogens, but they consist only of RNA, do not encode any protein and are replicated by a host plant cell's polymerase.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} is {{a collection}} of techniques used to analyse biological markers in <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> and proteomethe individual's genetic code and how their cells express their genes as proteinsby applying molecular biology to medical testing.
