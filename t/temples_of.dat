5|$|Another {{element of}} the Vijayanagara style is the carving and consecration of large monoliths such as the Sasivekaalu (mustard) Ganesha and Kadalekaalu (ground nut) Ganesha at Hampi, the Gommateshwara (Bahubali) monoliths in Karkala and Venur, and the Nandi bull in Lepakshi. The Vijayanagara <b>temples</b> <b>of</b> Kolar, Kanakagiri, Sringeri and other towns of Karnataka; the <b>temples</b> <b>of</b> Tadpatri, Lepakshi, Ahobilam, Tirumala Venkateswara Temple and Srikalahasti in Andhra Pradesh; and the <b>temples</b> <b>of</b> Vellore, Kumbakonam, Kanchi and Srirangam in Tamil Nadu are {{examples}} of this style. Vijayanagara art includes wall-paintings such as the Dashavatara and Girijakalyana (marriage of Parvati, Shiva's consort) in the Virupaksha Temple at Hampi, the Shivapurana murals (tales of Shiva) at the Virabhadra temple at Lepakshi, and those at the Kamaakshi and Varadaraja temples at Kanchi. This mingling of the South Indian styles resulted in a richness not seen in earlier centuries, a focus on reliefs in addition to sculpture that surpasses that previously in India.|$|E
5|$|Temples, {{where the}} state rituals were carried out, were filled with images of the gods. The most {{important}} temple image was the cult statue in the inner sanctuary. These statues were usually less than life-size, and made of the same precious materials that were said to form the gods' bodies. Many temples had several sanctuaries, each with a cult statue representing one of the gods in a group such as a family triad. The city's primary god was envisioned as its lord, employing many of the residents as servants in the divine household that the temple represented. The gods residing in the <b>temples</b> <b>of</b> Egypt collectively represented the entire pantheon. But many deities—including some important gods {{as well as those}} that were minor or hostile—were never given <b>temples</b> <b>of</b> their own, although some were represented in the <b>temples</b> <b>of</b> other gods.|$|E

5|$|The royal {{administration}} could also order one temple to divert its resources to another temple whose influence it wished to expand. Thus, a king might increase {{the income of}} the <b>temples</b> <b>of</b> a god he favored, and mortuary <b>temples</b> <b>of</b> recent rulers tended to siphon off resources from temples to pharaohs long dead. The most drastic means of controlling the temple estates was to completely revise the distribution of their property nationwide, which might extend to closing down certain temples. Such changes could significantly alter Egypt's economic landscape. The temples were thus important instruments with which the king managed the nation's resources and its people. As the direct overseers of their own economic sphere, the administrations of large temples wielded considerable influence and may have posed {{a challenge to the}} authority of a weak pharaoh, although it is unclear how independent they were.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} Third Intermediate Period, Old Kingdom {{mortuary}} temples enjoyed {{a revival of}} interest due primarily to the archaizing style favoured by the kings of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt (c. 760–656 BCE).

5|$|Each temple had a {{principal}} deity, and most were dedicated to other gods as well. Not all deities had temples dedicated to them. Many demons and household gods were involved primarily in magical or private religious practice, {{with little or}} no presence in temple ceremonies. There were also other gods who had significant roles in the cosmos but, for uncertain reasons, were not honored with <b>temples</b> <b>of</b> their own. Of those gods who did have <b>temples</b> <b>of</b> their own, many were venerated mainly in certain areas of Egypt, though many gods with a strong local tie were also important across the nation. Even deities whose worship spanned the country were strongly associated with the cities where their chief temples were located. In Egyptian creation myths, the first temple originated as a shelter for a god—which god it was varied according to the city—that stood on the mound of land where the process of creation began. Each temple in Egypt, therefore, was equated with this original temple and with the site of creation itself. As the primordial home of the god and the mythological location of the city's founding, the temple was seen as the hub of the region, from which the city's patron god ruled over it.|$|E
5|$|Hoysala temples have {{distinct}} {{parts that}} are merged {{to form a}} unified organic whole, {{in contrast to the}} <b>temples</b> <b>of</b> Tamil country where different parts of a temple stand independently.

They are characterised by a complex profusion of sculpture decorating all the temple parts chiselled of soft soapstone (chloritic schist), a good material for intricate carving, executed mostly by local craftsmen, and exhibit architectural features that distinguish them from other temple architectures of South India.|$|E
5|$|Images of Bhikshatana {{are found}} {{throughout}} Shaiva <b>temples</b> <b>of</b> South India, but are almost unknown in Northern India.

In South Indian temples, Bhikshatana is prescribed to be enshrined as an avarana-devata (a deity depicted on the circumambulatory path encircling the central shrine). Similarly in Orissan temples, Bhikshatana may be worshipped and depicted as parshva-devata (an attendant deity) or avarana-devata.|$|E
50|$|In the Eastern Jin dynasty, {{the renowned}} Daoist Ge Hong once refined elixirs here. During Ge Hong's stay on Mt.
