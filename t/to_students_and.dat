5|$|In 1989, NeXT {{struck a}} deal for former Compaq {{reseller}} Businessland to sell NeXT computers in select markets nationwide. Selling through a retailer was a major change from NeXT's original business model of only selling directly <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> educational institutions.

5|$|In 2006, {{members of}} Georgia Tech's college Republican club sued Georgia Tech, {{aided by the}} Alliance Defense Fund, in a case known as Sklar v. Clough that lasted until April 2008. The {{students}} won this case and Georgia Tech was forced to drop their speech code which was deemed unconstitutional and pay the defendants court costs. Clough stepped down after almost fourteen years as President on July 1, 2008, which he previously announced in an email <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> staff on March 15, 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression, {{although}} negative to {{the local}} economy, also benefited the San Diego State Teachers College, {{as the federal government}} made money available for construction projects in an attempt to stimulate the economy. For the campus, some of these construction projects included new buildings (such as a $500,000 stadium completed in 1936 and a $200,000 open air theater completed in 1941), facilities, and art works. Several federal programs were also created to give jobs <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> to increase financial aid.|$|E
5|$|King's {{was divided}} into a senior {{department}} and a junior department, also known as King's College School, which was originally situated {{in the basement of}} the Strand Campus. The Junior department started with 85 pupils and only three teachers, but quickly grew to 500 by 1841, outgrowing its facilities and leading it to relocate to Wimbledon in 1897 where it remains today, though it is no longer associated with King's College London. Within the Senior department teaching {{was divided into}} three courses: a general course comprised divinity, classical languages, mathematics, English literature and history; a medical course; and miscellaneous subjects, such as law, political economy and modern languages, which were not related to any systematic course of study at the time and depended for their continuance on the supply of occasional students. In 1833 the general course was reorganised leading to the award of the Associate of King's College (AKC), the first qualification issued by King's. The course, which concerns questions of ethics and theology, is still awarded today <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> staff who take an optional three-year course alongside their studies.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of its over a millennium-long history, the mosque has been {{alternately}} neglected and highly regarded. Because it was founded as a Shiite Ismaili institution, Saladin and the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty that he founded shunned al-Azhar, removing {{its status as a}} congregational mosque and denying stipends <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> teachers at its school. These moves were reversed under the Mamluk Sultanate, under whose rule numerous expansions and renovations took place. Later rulers of Egypt showed differing degrees of deference to the mosque and provided widely varying levels of financial assistance, both to the school and to the upkeep of the mosque. Today, al-Azhar remains a deeply influential institution in Egyptian society that is highly revered in the Sunni Muslim world and a symbol of Islamic Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Since its inaugural school year, Union City High School {{has offered}} college-level courses <b>to</b> <b>students,</b> <b>and</b> through its {{partnerships}} with nearby colleges and universities, {{increased the number}} of such courses for the 2010–2011 school year, enabling students to accumulate up to 12 - 15 college credits by graduation that can be transferred to New Jersey public colleges. In addition to Liberal Arts courses, students can take advanced placement biology, chemistry, physics, anatomy & physiology, forensic science, robotics, geometry, algebra 2, and calculus at the AEA. Students preparing for civil engineering and architecture careers can take pre-engineering, computer networking and computer aided design (CAD) at the AEA. The AEA offers a course in Mandarin Chinese added in 2016, {{making it one of the}} few high schools in New Jersey to do so. The Advanced Placement participation rate in the school was 13%.|$|E
5|$|The case {{concerned}} The Spectrum, {{a student}} newspaper published {{as part of}} a Journalism II class at Hazelwood East High School in St. Louis County, Missouri. The Spectrum was published roughly every three weeks during the 1982–1983 school year. About 4,500 copies were distributed <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> community members. The cost of printing the paper, as well as supplies, textbooks, and a portion of the academic advisor's salary, were furnished by the district's Board of Education, supplemented by newspaper sales. For that school year, the board supplied $4,668 in printing costs, and the newspaper generated $1,166 in revenue.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} in Scotland continued {{as a civil}} war. Lord Moray was assassinated on 23 January 1570. The regent who succeeded him, the Earl of Lennox, was also a victim of violence. On 30 April 1571, the controller of Edinburgh Castle, Kirkcaldy of Grange, ordered all enemies of the Queen to leave the city. But for Knox, his former friend and fellow galley-slave, he made an exception. If Knox did not leave, he could stay in Edinburgh, but only if he remained captive in the castle. Knox chose to leave, and on 5 May he left for St Andrews. He continued to preach, spoke <b>to</b> <b>students,</b> <b>and</b> worked on his History. At the end of July 1572, after a truce was called, he returned to Edinburgh. Although by this time exceedingly feeble and his voice faint, he continued to preach at St Giles'.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year the college was officially integrated as A welcomed its first African American student. More change ensued, as, in 1965, the Board of Directors voted to make {{membership in the}} Corps of Cadets voluntary. The same year the Board voted to allow any woman, not just those connected <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> professors, to attend the university. The Board required that Rudder approve each female applicant; he accepted any woman who met the academic requirements. During Rudder's tenure, African-American students were also welcomed, and in 1967, James L. Courtney of Dallas became the first African American to receive an undergraduate degree from Texas A University. He remained at Texas A and, in 1970, became the first African American to receive a D.V.M. degree from the College of Veterinary Medicine.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{improvements}} in computing {{technology and the}} early development of relatively cheaper mainframe computers, which would later be termed minicomputers, led to the loosening of restrictions regarding programming access to the computers. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), access to the TX-0 experimental computer was opened <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> employees of the university. This in turn {{led to the development}} of programs that in addition to highlighting the power of the computer also contained an entertainment aspect. The games created for the TX-0 by the small programming community at MIT included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze, which let players set up a maze for a mouse to run through. When the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 computer was installed at MIT in 1961, the community built a video game to showcase its abilities, Spacewar, which then became the first known video game to spread beyond a single computer installation as it was copied and recreated on other PDP-1 systems and later on other mainframe computers.|$|E

5|$|Calvin {{produced}} {{commentaries on}} most of the books of the Bible. His first commentary on Romans was published in 1540, and he planned to write commentaries on the entire New Testament. Six years passed before he wrote his second, a commentary on First Epistle to the Corinthians, but after that he devoted more attention to reaching his goal. Within four years he had published commentaries on all the Pauline epistles, and he also revised the commentary on Romans. He then {{turned his attention to the}} general epistles, dedicating them to Edward VI of England. By 1555 he had completed his work on the New Testament, finishing with the Acts and the Gospels (he omitted only the brief second and third Epistles of John and the Book of Revelation). For the Old Testament, he wrote commentaries on Isaiah, the books of the Pentateuch, the Psalms, and Joshua. The material for the commentaries often originated from lectures <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> ministers that he reworked for publication. From 1557 onwards, he could not find the time to continue this method, and he gave permission for his lectures to be published from stenographers' notes. These Praelectiones covered the minor prophets, Daniel, Jeremiah, Lamentations, and part of Ezekiel.|$|E
5|$|In May 1944 {{a series}} of protests against Ubico broke out at the {{university}} in Guatemala City. Ubico responded by suspending the constitution on June 22, 1944. The protests, which by this point included many middle-class members and junior army officers in addition <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> workers, gained momentum, eventually forcing Ubico's resignation {{at the end of}} June. Ubico appointed a three-person junta led by General Federico Ponce Vaides to succeed him. Although Ponce Vaides initially promised to hold free elections, when the congress met on July 3, soldiers held everyone at gunpoint and forced them to appoint Ponce Vaides interim president. The repressive policies of the Ubico administration were continued. Opposition groups began organizing again, this time joined by many prominent political and military leaders, who deemed the Ponce regime unconstitutional. Árbenz {{had been one of the}} few officers in the military to protest the actions of Ponce Vaides. Ubico had fired Árbenz from his teaching post at the Escuela Politécnica, and since then Árbenz had been living in ElSalvador, organizing a band of revolutionary exiles. Árbenz was one of the leaders of the plot within the army, along with Major Aldana Sandoval. Árbenz insisted that civilians also be included in the coup, over the protests of the other military men involved. Sandoval later said that all contact with the civilians during the coup was through Árbenz.|$|E
5|$|The {{onset of}} World War II {{increased}} economic unrest in Guatemala. Ubico responded by cracking down more fiercely on {{any form of}} protest or dissent. In 1944, popular revolt broke out in neighboring El Salvador, which briefly toppled dictator Maximiliano Hernández Martínez. However, he quickly returned to power, leading to a flood of exiled El Salvadorian revolutionaries moving to Guatemala. This coincided {{with a series of}} protests at the university in Guatemala City. Ubico responded by suspending the constitution on 22 June 1944. The protesters, who by this point included many middle-class members in addition <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> workers, called for a general strike, and presented an ultimatum to Ubico the next day, demanding the reinstatement of the constitution. They also presented him a petition signed by 311 of the most prominent Guatemalan citizens. Ubico sent the police to disrupt the protests by firing on them, and declared martial law. Clashes between protesters and the military continued for a week, during which the revolt gained momentum. At the end of June, Ubico submitted his resignation to the National Assembly, leading to huge celebrations in the streets.|$|E
