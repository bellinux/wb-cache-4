5|$|An {{important}} {{generalization of}} the derivative concerns complex functions of complex variables, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers C <b>to</b> <b>C.</b> The {{notion of the}} derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If C is identified with R2 by writing a complex number z as , then a differentiable function from C <b>to</b> <b>C</b> is certainly differentiable as a function from R2 to R2 (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is complex linear and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the Cauchy–Riemann equations – see holomorphic functions.|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} microorganisms, {{including}} gram-negative and gram-positive eubacteria, actinomycetes, yeasts, and filamentous fungi, were tested for their sensitivity <b>to</b> cadmium (<b>Cd).</b> In general, the actinomycetes were more tolerant <b>to</b> <b>Cd</b> {{than were the}} eubacteria; gram-negative eubacteria were more tolerant <b>to</b> <b>Cd</b> than were gram-positive eubacteria. The period of exponential growth of the eubacteria and actinomycetes was extended {{in the presence of}} Cd. Wide extremes in sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>Cd</b> were noted among the fungi; there was no correlation between the class of fungus and tolerance <b>to</b> <b>Cd.</b> Fungal sporulation was more sensitive <b>to</b> <b>Cd</b> than was mycelial growth, as spore formation was inhibited at Cd concentrations that were noninhibitory to mycelial proliferation.
