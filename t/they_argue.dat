5|$|Niklausse and Van Tricasse {{climb up}} the clock tower to survey the troops. They are at first argumentative, then calm down and help {{each other in the}} clean air at the top. They agree they must stop the war but, once they reach the {{polluted}} air, <b>they</b> <b>argue</b> again in their urgency to get to war.|$|E
5|$|Several {{anti-noise}} {{and electric}} car advocates have opposed {{the introduction of}} artificial sounds as warning for pedestrians, as <b>they</b> <b>argue</b> that the proposed system will only increase noise pollution. They also opposed U.S. pending legislation that would require generated warning sounds with no off switch for the driver.|$|E
5|$|Such eliminativists have {{developed}} different arguments {{to show that}} folk psychology is a seriously mistaken theory {{and needs to be}} abolished. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> that folk psychology excludes from its purview or has traditionally been mistaken about many important mental phenomena that can, and are, being examined and explained by modern neurosciences. Some examples are dreaming, consciousness, mental disorders, learning processes, and memory abilities. Furthermore, <b>they</b> <b>argue,</b> folk psychology's development in the last 2,500 years has not been significant and it is therefore a stagnating theory. The ancient Greeks already had a folk psychology comparable to modern views. But in contrast to this lack of development, the neurosciences are a rapidly progressing science complex that, in their view, can explain many cognitive processes that folk psychology cannot.|$|E

50|$|The {{defendants}} {{denied that}} any of their products sold were counterfeit. <b>They</b> <b>argued</b> that even {{if any of the}} Microsoft products were counterfeit, they purchased them in the good faith that such products were genuine. Furthermore, <b>they</b> <b>argued</b> that their selling of Microsoft products was protected by the first-sale doctrine and thus the copyright infringement claim did not hold.|$|R
5|$|According to Pentecostal biblical interpretation, the Gospel of John 20:22 {{shows that}} the disciples of Jesus were already born again before the Holy Spirit fell at Pentecost. They then cite biblical {{examples}} in the Book of Acts 2, 8, 10, and 19 {{to show that it}} was common in the New Testament for Spirit baptism to occur after conversion. In following the biblical pattern, <b>they</b> <b>argue,</b> Christians today should also pray for this baptism which results in greater power for ministry and witness.|$|E
5|$|After {{saying goodbye}} to {{everyone}} in the bar, Diane returns to the office and accidentally hits Sam's nose when she opens the door. Because of that, she is convinced that Sam was coming out of the office to say something to her. <b>They</b> <b>argue,</b> admit their feelings for each other, and come into the terms that their relationship with Derek is nothing compared to their potential relationship together. Sam and Diane embrace, but then Diane rejects his advances, i.e. attempts to kiss her. They insult each other and, at the end, kiss passionately.|$|E
5|$|At a {{research}} lab in Colson, Washington, intellectually disabled janitor Roland Fuller is scolded by scientist Dr. Keats for forgetting {{how to use}} the facility's keycard locks. Keats walks in on his colleagues, Frank Nollette and Ronald Surnow, as <b>they</b> <b>argue</b> over a prototype jet engine they are developing. Nollette wants to push testing of the engine to break mach 15, but Surnow is unwilling to risk damaging the prototype. After Keats and Nollette angrily leave, Surnow enters the facility's wind tunnel to make adjustments. However, Roland activates the tunnel's turbines, sending Surnow flying to his death.|$|E

5|$|Bamber's lawyers {{argued that}} images of Sheila {{taken by a}} police {{photographer}} at around 9am on 7 August 1985 showed her blood was still wet. According to the defence team, had she been killed before 3:30am, as the prosecution said, the blood would have congealed by 9am. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> that she was alive when Bamber was standing outside {{the house with the}} police, shot herself in the kitchen just as the police entered, then ran up one of the staircases to the bedroom, where she shot herself again, this time fatally.|$|E
5|$|Bina Agarwal and Pradeep Panda {{illustrate}} that a woman's property status (such as owning {{a house or}} land) directly and significantly reduces her chances of experiencing domestic violence, while employment makes little difference. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> that such immovable property increases women's self-esteem, economic security, and strengthens their fall-back positions, enhancing their options and bargaining clout. They show that property ownership is an important contributor to women's economic well-being because it reduces their susceptibility to violence.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{scholars}} like Surendranath Sen, Mohibbul Hasan, N. K. Sinha, and B. Sheik Ali, who have analysed Tipu's religious policies on Christians, conclude {{that he was}} not a religious bigot. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> that forcible conversions to Islam were done purely for political, not religious reasons. Forced conversions were carried out as a punishment for Christians who supported the British against their own native suzerain. The conversions came after many warnings by Tippu.|$|E
5000|$|Hutchinson {{was on that}} wing of the Liberal Party {{which called}} itself the Liberal Imperialists. <b>They</b> <b>argued</b> that the Liberals had lost the centre vote because the party had distanced itself from [...] "the new Imperial spirit". Instead, <b>they</b> <b>argued</b> for a [...] "clean slate" [...] with the old, {{classical}} Liberalism giving way to the new ideas of [...] "National Efficiency" [...] and imperialism.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to Stanford University itself, the defendants included Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole, President Gerhard Casper, and Board of Trustees President John Freidenrich. The defendants made two {{arguments in the}} suit. First, <b>they</b> <b>argued</b> that Stanford's speech code was protected under Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, as the code only prohibited fighting words. Secondly, <b>they</b> <b>argued</b> that the Leonard Law actually violated Stanford's First Amendment rights, as Stanford is a private entity.|$|R
5|$|Feminist economists {{join the}} UN {{and others in}} {{acknowledging}} care work, {{as a kind of}} work which includes all tasks involving caregiving, as central to economic development and human well-being. Feminist economists study both paid and unpaid care work. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> that traditional analysis of economics often ignores the value of household unpaid work. Feminist economists have argued that unpaid domestic work is as valuable as paid work, so measures of economic success should include unpaid work. They have shown that women are disproportionately responsible for performing such care work.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, Paul Krugman {{released}} his book The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008, arguing that economic {{conditions similar to}} what existed during the earlier part of the 20th century had returned, making Keynesian policy prescriptions more relevant than ever. In February 2009 Robert J. Shiller and George Akerlof published , a book where <b>they</b> <b>argue</b> the current US stimulus package is too small as {{it does not take}} into account Keynes's insight on the importance of confidence and expectations in determining the future behaviour of businesspeople and other economic agents.|$|E
5|$|Many feminist economists argue {{economics}} {{should be}} focused less on mechanisms (like income) or theories (such as utilitarianism) {{and more on}} well-being, a multidimensional concept including income, health, education, empowerment and social status. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> that economic success {{can not be measured}} only by goods or gross domestic product, but must also be measured by human well-being. Aggregate income is not sufficient to evaluate general well-being, because individual entitlements and needs must also be considered, leading feminist economists to study health, longevity, access to property, education, and related factors.|$|E

5|$|Margunn Bjørnholt and Ailsa McKay {{argue that}} the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> that such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics that take as their starting point the socially responsible, sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other {{as well as the}} planet.|$|E
5|$|Most {{churches in}} the {{prosperity}} movement are non-denominational and independent, though some groups have formed networks. Prosperity churches typically reject Presbyterian polity (or governance) {{and the idea that}} a pastor should be accountable to elders; it is common for pastors of prosperity churches to be the highest organizational authority figure. Critics, including Sarah Posner and Joe Conason, maintain that prosperity teachers cultivate authoritarian organizations. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> that leaders attempt to control the lives of adherents by claiming divinely bestowed authority. Jenkins contends that prosperity theology is used as a tool to justify the high salaries of pastors.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} philosophers, {{including}} Elizabeth Anscombe , Jean Bethke Elshtain , Servais Pinckaers, Iris Murdoch, and the Catholic Encyclopedia, have all {{suggested that the}} Kantian conception of ethics rooted in autonomy is contradictory in its dual contention that humans are co-legislators of morality and that morality is a priori. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> that if something is universally a priori (i.e., existing unchangingly prior to experience), then it cannot also be in part dependent upon humans, who have not always existed. On the other hand, if humans truly do legislate morality, then they are not bound by it objectively, because they are always free to change it.|$|E

The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E
5|$|Before leaving, {{they attend}} Ron's brother Bill's wedding, {{but during the}} {{reception}} the Ministry of Magic finally falls to Voldemort and the wedding is attacked. They flee to 12 Grimmauld Place in London, the family home of Sirius Black that Harry had inherited a year before. They identify R.A.B. as Sirius' brother Regulus Black, and learn from the house-elf Kreacher, Slytherin's locket was stolen {{from the house and}} then seized by Dolores Umbridge of the Ministry of Magic. They infiltrate the Ministry of Magic using Polyjuice Potion and take back the locket, but have no way to destroy it. With the Ministry now after them, the trio goes on the run across the countryside. Under the object's evil influence and the strain of constant vigilance, <b>they</b> <b>argue</b> and Ron leaves.|$|E
5|$|Carol buys a car, and the McCoys {{drive to}} an {{electronics}} store.

Suddenly, all the television sets in the store show Doc's picture, prompting him to leave immediately. The proprietor gets a glimpse of the picture, and calls the police. Doc steals a shotgun, followed by several shoot-outs and police chases. The couple escape by hiding in a large trash bin, only to end up {{in the back of a}} garbage truck that dumps its load at the local landfill. Filthy and frustrated, <b>they</b> <b>argue</b> about whether to stay together or split up. They decide to see things through.|$|E
50|$|VCCL and Vadarlis {{made two}} main arguments. Firstly, <b>they</b> <b>argued</b> that the {{provisions}} of the Migration Act 1958 (which regulates immigration) applied to the asylum seekers, and the normal procedures for dealing with other non-citizens should be applied. The Migration Act did empower the Government to detain all non-citizens, under the system of mandatory detention, but it also gave non-citizens certain rights, such as the right to seek asylum and to apply for protection visas. As such, <b>they</b> <b>argued</b> that the asylum seekers should be taken to the mainland and be allowed to apply for visas. Alternatively, <b>they</b> <b>argued</b> that if the Migration Act did not apply to the situation of these asylum seekers, then they were being detained unlawfully, and that no-one in Australia, regardless of their citizenship status, could be detained unlawfully or arbitrarily, and so they should be released.|$|R
