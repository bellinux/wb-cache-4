5|$|Soon after {{publishing}} the special <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> in 1905, Einstein {{started thinking about}} how to incorporate gravity into his new relativistic framework. In 1907, beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall, he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity. After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations. These equations specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter and radiation are present, and form the core of Einstein's general <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{physicists}} and mathematicians including Albert Einstein and Hermann Minkowski pioneered {{the use of}} four-dimensional geometry for describing the physical world. These efforts culminated {{in the formulation of}} Einstein's general <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity,</b> which relates gravity to the geometry of four-dimensional spacetime.|$|E
5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909), Switzerland. However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields and—with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916—he published a paper on general relativity. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> to model the large-scale structure of the universe.|$|E

Introduction. We have published two books [1, 2] questioning the special and general <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity.</b> a) In {{the first book}} we presented our 1972 hypothesis {{that there is no}} speed barrier in the universe and one can construct arbitrary speeds- thus refuting the speed of ligh...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} time is {{variously}} understood and varied expressions of time available are critically discussed. The nature of time formation, its structure and textures are presented taking examples from natural sciences and Indian spirituality. The physics and mathematics used to evolve the concept of time are chronologically presented. The mathematical allusion and physical illusion associated with the concept <b>of</b> <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> are analyzed. The mathematical conjectures responsible for evolution <b>of</b> <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> are pronounced. The missing physical reality in <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> in relation to appearance of contraction of length and dilation {{of time is}} given comparing these mathematical illusions associated; with the optical illusion of appearance of a scale as bent in water in a beaker to stress the point of illusion - mental and physical respectively. The physical and mathematical nature of time, its measurement and passage and the complex mathematical nature of physical and psychological times are presented...|$|R

5|$|The {{issue of}} the radius of the {{electron}} is a challenging problem of the modern theoretical physics. The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron is incompatible to the premises of the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity.</b> On the other hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the self-energy of the electron tending to infinity.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{put forward}} the basic {{principle}} of relativity, {{that the laws}} of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant speed in a straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to Einstein's special <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity.</b>|$|E

50|$|This {{system is}} useful in physics, {{especially}} in the special and general <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity.</b> All physical quantities are identified with geometric quantities such as areas, lengths, dimensionless numbers, path curvatures, or sectional curvatures.|$|R
5|$|In {{everyday}} life, {{there are}} three familiar dimensions of space: height, width and depth. Einstein's general <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general relativity, space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four-dimensional spacetime, three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this framework, the phenomenon of gravity {{is viewed as a}} consequence of the geometry of spacetime.|$|E
5|$|The {{elementary}} {{objects of}} geometry –points, lines, triangles– are traditionally defined in three-dimensional space or on two-dimensional surfaces. In 1907, Hermann Minkowski, Einstein's former mathematics {{professor at the}} Swiss Federal Polytechnic, introduced a geometric formulation of Einstein's special <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> where the geometry included not only space but also time. The basic entity of this new geometry is four-dimensional spacetime. The orbits of moving bodies are curves in spacetime; the orbits of bodies moving at constant speed without changing direction correspond to straight lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{telescope}} {{was involved in}} the discovery of millisecond pulsars, and also discovered the first pulsar in a globular cluster in 1986—a millisecond pulsar in the Messier 28 globular cluster. In September 2006, the results of three years of observing a double pulsar, PSR J0737-3039, with the Lovell telescope, {{as well as with the}} Parkes and Green Bank Telescopes, were announced— confirming that the general <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> is accurate to 99.5%.|$|E
50|$|Theory {{choice was}} a main {{problem in the}} {{philosophy}} of science in the early 20th century, and under the impact of the new and controversial <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> and quantum physics, came to involve how scientists should choose between competing theories.|$|R

5|$|Current {{understanding}} of gravity {{is based on}} Albert Einstein's general <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity.</b> Formulated in 1915, general relativity explains gravity {{in terms of the}} geometry of space and time, or spacetime. It is formulated in the language of classical physics developed by physicists such as Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell. The other nongravitational forces are explained in the framework of quantum mechanics. Developed {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century by a number of different physicists, quantum mechanics provides a radically different way of describing physical phenomena based on probability.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 Einstein {{postulated}} {{from the}} outset that {{the speed of light}} in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the motion of the source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the special <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity,</b> in which the speed of light in vacuum c featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still adhered) useless and revolutionized the concepts of space and time.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Einstein {{applied the}} general <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> to the {{structure}} of the universe as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the deepest}} {{problems}} in modern physics {{is the problem of}} quantum gravity. The current understanding of gravity is based on Albert Einstein's general <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity,</b> which is formulated within the framework of classical physics. However, nongravitational forces are described within the framework of quantum mechanics, a radically different formalism for describing physical phenomena based on probability. A quantum theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics, but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions of quantum theory to the force of gravity.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} Universe is {{somewhat}} difficult to define. According to a restrictive definition, the Universe is everything within our connected spacetime that could {{have a chance to}} interact with us and vice versa. According to the general <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity,</b> some regions of space may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space, even if the Universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light can traverse it.|$|E
5|$|Understanding {{of how the}} Sun is {{expected}} to continue to evolve required an understanding of the source of its power. Arthur Stanley Eddington's confirmation of Albert Einstein's <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>relativity</b> led to his realisation that the Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion reactions in its core, fusing hydrogen into helium. In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements also might form within stars. Fred Hoyle elaborated on this premise by arguing that evolved stars called red giants created many elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in their cores. When a red giant finally casts off its outer layers, these elements would then be recycled to form other star systems.|$|E
