5|$|Bunnies & Burrows has the {{advantage}} of offering players an intuitive grasp of relative dangers and appropriate actions not possible in game worlds that are substantially fictional. For example, a player is told their character is confronted with a fox. There is an immediate intuition on the amount of peril a rabbit is facing. Although player characters are substantially weaker <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dangers they face, the game {{is one of the first}} to encourage problem solving and outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{strategic}} importance, the castle and the defences of the Thames and Medway were badly neglected during the 17th century. The Dutch Republic mounted an unexpected naval raid in June 1667, and the Dutch fleet {{was able to}} breach the defences, capturing two warships and burning others at anchor in the river at Chatham, {{in one of the}} worst defeats suffered by the Royal Navy. Upnor Castle acquitted itself better <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other defensive sites along the upper Medway, despite its lack of provisioning. Gun fire from the fort and from adjoining emplacements forced a Dutch retreat after a couple of days, before they were able to burn the dockyard itself.|$|E
5|$|Holkham Hall {{is one of}} England's finest {{examples}} of the Palladian revival style of architecture, and the severity of its design is closer to Palladio's ideals <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other numerous Palladian style houses of the period. The Holkham Estate, had been built up by Sir Edward Coke, the founder of his family fortune. He bought Neales manor in 1609, though never lived there, and many other purchases of land in Norfolk to endow to his six sons. His fourth son, John, inherited the land and married heiress Meriel Wheatley in 1612. They made Hill Hall their home and by 1659 John had complete ownership of all three Holkham manors. It is the ancestral home of the Coke family, the Earls of Leicester of Holkham.|$|E

5|$|Pennsylvania {{came back}} into service more quickly <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other battleships present during the attack; it left on 20 December and was under repair in San Francisco until 30 March 1942. For the next several months, Pennsylvania was {{stationed}} on the United States' West Coast, before being reassigned to Pearl Harbor as the fleet flagship {{for a short time}} (August to October). After another refit in San Francisco, which lasted until February 1943, the ship was sent to assist American forces engaged in the Aleutian Islands Campaign. During this time, Pennsylvania was nearly hit by a torpedo from , which was later sunk.|$|E
5|$|The {{hotel was}} not immensely {{profitable}} in its opening years; smaller <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new hotels springing {{up in that}} period, it was not fashionable initially, and was resented {{by many of the}} London elite who considered it vulgar. It took £3628 in 1908, over a thousand pounds less than the previous year, and the hotel lost over £50,000 between 15 May 1906 and 31 July 1908, which led to the replacement of Elles with manager with Theodore Kroell and appointment of Charles Van Gyzelen as manager of the restaurant.|$|E
5|$|King Teuruarii IV {{was born}} Prince Epatiana in around 1879 {{on the island}} of Rurutu, in present-day French Polynesia, to King Teuruarii III and his second wife Taarouru a Mootua. His family was {{originally}} from a chiefly line in Huahine rather than Rurutu, and it was only through the adoption of his father by King Teuruarii I that his family was eligible to rule. The island of Rurutu was settled later <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surrounding islands and was historically ruled as an unoccupied territory by the earliest kings of the archipelago. Including these early kings, the royal line of Epatiana stretched back more than forty generations and included many of the founding chiefs of the Austral Islands kingdoms, as well as early kings of Rurutu after the settlement of the island. Little is recorded of the prince's childhood, although it is known that Epatiana and his parents were visited by the French writer and later governor of French Polynesia, Édouard Petit, in the early 1880s, when the young prince Epatiana was still nursing from his mother.|$|E

Cropper responded by stating that he thought Belushi was as good as (or even better <b>than)</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> singers he had backed; he also noted that Belushi had, early in his career, briefly been a professional drummer, and had an especially keen sense of rhythm.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} was subsequently sent to Nimes, France to rebuild, as many divisions mauled on the Eastern Front were. On 1 May 1944 it absorbed men and tanks of the 155th Reserve Panzer Division {{to return to}} its full strength. During this absorption it received 31 Panzer IIIs, 74 Panzer IVs, 20 assault guns, 15 Panther tanks and 200 other vehicles. The division then conducted training exercises up until June of that year. It was reassigned to an area on the Rhone River for a time. It was in better shape <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other divisions in the area, which were refitting, forming, or lacked transportation to move effectively.|$|E
25|$|B-72 is a {{thermoplastic}} resin {{that was created}} by Rohm and Haas {{for use as a}} surface coating and as a vehicle for Flexographic ink. However B-72 is now being used more as an adhesive specifically for ceramic and glass. One of the major advantages of B-72 as a consolidate is that it is stronger and harder than polyvinyl acetate without being extremely brittle. This adhesive is more flexible <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other typically-used adhesives and tolerates stress and strain on a join that most others can not. One major drawback to using B-72 is the difficulty of applying the acrylic resin as an adhesive, as is difficulty in manipulating the substance as a workable agent. The most suitable solvent for B-72 is acetone.|$|E

25|$|Multiple {{mechanical}} problems appeared {{during the}} sea trials. Many of the problems encountered in Collins were quickly repaired, and did not occur again or in the other five submarines. Recurring issues were usually associated with diesel engines, propeller shaft seals, periscopes and masts, hydraulic couplings, and the combat system. At the same time, many of the systems worked with few or no problems, with the submarine meeting or exceeding design specifications for maximum speed, manoeuvrability, and submerged endurance, particularly at low speeds. The ship control system, which had been a major concern during development of the class, functioned beyond positive expectation. The submarine's autopilot (which aboard Collins was nicknamed 'Sven') {{was found to be}} better at depth keeping during snorting <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operators.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{was born}} in Auckland, New Zealand, {{and grew up in}} Te Atatu South, a suburb in the west of Auckland, {{attending}} Edmonton Primary, Rangeview Intermediate and Henderson High School. His talent for playing was discovered early, as a 10-year-old tackling 15- to 18-year-olds at the weekend kick-abouts at the primary school. He played for the primary school team when still in standard one, when he was three years younger <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older children {{and by the time he}} attended Henderson High School, he was already well-known locally. He then helped turn a mediocre high school first XV into a successful rugby team that could compete with Auckland Grammar and Kelston Boys High (the regional heavyweights) for the first time. He played for the local Waitemata Rugby Club and it wasn't long before the Auckland representative team (coached by John Hart) took notice.|$|E
25|$|In 1895 Methil harbour had shipped 727,564 tons, {{overtaking}} Burntisland, and abstracting {{some business}} from smaller ports {{which could not}} accept the larger vessels coming into use. From 1904 a further increase in shipments from Methil was expected, and the no 2 dock was already smaller <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vessels currently in use. W F Jackson had succeeded Conacher as General Manager of the North British Railway, owner of the docks, and he too {{seems to have been}} antagonistic to Wemyss. Widening and deepening the shipping access to Methil was, he said, impractical, and Wemyss replied in a letter stating that he had prepared a scheme that could be implemented, but that if the NBR would not act on the matter, Wemyss would build a new dock himself. His original undertaking not to do so had been, he said, contingent on the NBR extending and enlarging the dock themselves as might be necessary.|$|E

25|$|Miami International Airport (MIA) {{is one of}} {{the busiest}} {{airports}} in the United States in terms of total passenger traffic and cargo traffic, but {{especially when it comes to}} international traffic. It is considered to be the largest economic engine in Miami-Dade County, and has a large employee base. It was connected to the Metrorail system in 2012 via the only significant extension to the system in its history, the AirportLink that created the Orange Line, which most significantly led to higher service frequency in the southern portion of the existing Green Line. The connection is made at the Miami Airport Station through the MIA Mover people mover, and the station only sees about 1,500 passengers a day, much lower <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system's other stations. With headways cut in half, ridership rose much more on double-lined portion of the system from Earlington Heights to Dadeland South stations than the Airport Station itself. MIA has seen record growth in the 2010s, with the addition of many major international flights and carriers, though many are connecting flights, similar to Hartsfield Jackson, with Miami being a layover not a final destination.|$|E
25|$|Radiation therapy uses special {{equipment}} to send {{high doses of}} radiation to the cancer cells. Most cells in the body grow and divide to form new cells. But cancer cells grow and divide faster <b>than</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> normal cells around them. Radiation works by making small breaks in the DNA inside cell. Radiation {{might not be a}} choice of treatment if the tumour was diagnosed on the late stage or is located on vulnerable places. Moreover, radiation causes significant side effects if used in children aged 0–14. It was determined to be a beneficial treatment but it causes significant side effects that influence the lifestyle of the young patients. Radiotherapy is the use of high-energy rays, usually x-rays and similar rays (such as electrons) to treat disease. It works by destroying cancer cells in the area that's treated. Although normal cells can also be damaged by radiotherapy, they can usually repair themselves, but cancer cells can't. If the tumour was found on the late stage, it requires patient`s higher radiation explosion and might be harmful for the organs.Radiotherapy is determined to be an effective treatment in adults but it causes significant side effects that can influence patients` daily living. In children radiotherapy mostly causes long-term side effects such as hearing loss and blindness. Children who had received cranial radiotherapy are deemed at a high risk for academic failure and cognitive delay.|$|E
