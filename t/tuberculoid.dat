5000|$|On diascopy, {{it shows}} {{characteristic}} [...] "apple-jelly" [...] color. Biopsy will reveal <b>tuberculoid</b> granuloma with few bacilli. Mantoux test is positive.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tuberculoid</b> leprosy is a skin {{condition}} characterized by solitary skin lesions that are asymmetrically distributed with few lesions and well demarcated edges. There are also early and marked nerve damage.It tends to heal spontaneously.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of lepromin antigen in use that differ in the method of preparation. [...] The Dharmendra antigen evokes a {{stronger}} early positive reaction than the Mitsuda antigen, which provokes a stronger late reaction. A strong Mitsuda reaction indicates a strong cell mediated immune response and a milder <b>tuberculoid</b> disease. Thus the strength of the reaction to lepromin can be used to help classify the extent of the disease as defined by within the Ridley-Jopling classification system. Strong positive Fernandez responses represent strong cell mediated responses which suppress the bacterium and result in <b>tuberculoid</b> HD. Progressively weaker responses are consistent with diagnoses moving through borderline diagnoses to lepromatous HD.|$|E
50|$|DR2 serotypes are {{associated}} with Goodpasture syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and narcolepsy, <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy (multi-drug resistant tuberculosis or leprosy), ulcerative colitis(Japanese), primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis. DR2 {{is also found in}} all patients that test positive for anti-anti-Asn-RNA-synthetase and chronic interstitial lung disease.|$|E

50|$|Dharmendra's Lepromin {{suspension}} {{consists of}} 10 mg of the dried and de-fatted, bacillary powder, dissolved in 100 ml carbol saline solution. It is a revised {{form of the}} original Lepromin test developed in 1919 by Kensuke Mitsuda. The Dharmendra test allows to differentiate <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy from lepromatous leprosy.|$|E
50|$|At {{the other}} extreme, lepromatous leprosy is {{characterized}} by depressed cell-mediated immunity, numerous bacilli within the tissues, no granulomas, and a negative skin test for lepromin. Within these two extremes are the patients with an intermediate or borderline form of leprosy who show a variable lepromin reaction and few bacilli; they may progress to either <b>tuberculoid</b> or lepromatousleprosy.|$|E
50|$|The {{incubation}} period of M. leprae can range between nine months and twenty years. It replicates intracellularly inside histiocytes and nerve cells {{and has two}} forms. One form is <b>tuberculoid,</b> which induces a cell-mediated response that limits its growth. Through this form M. leprae multiplies {{at the site of}} entry, usually the skin, invading and colonizing Schwann cells. The microbe then induces T-helper lymphocytes, epitheloid cells, and giant cell infiltration of the skin, causing infected individuals to exhibit large flattened patches with raised and elevated red edges on their skin. These patches have dry, pale, hairless centers, accompanied by a loss of sensation on the skin. The loss of sensation may develop as a result of invasion of the peripheral sensory nerves. The macule at the cutaneous site of entry and the loss of pain sensation are key clinical indications that an individual has a <b>tuberculoid</b> form of leprosy.|$|E
50|$|M. leprae {{cannot be}} grown on routine {{laboratory}} culture media, so drug sensitivity testing in vitro is not possible. Growth and drug susceptibility testing are done by injecting into animal models. One {{description of a}} clinical picture that results from <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy is characterized by intact cell-mediated immunity, a positive lepromin skin reaction, granuloma formation, and a relative paucity of bacilli.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the many}} {{patients}} that Dr Meyers helped at the Leprosarium were some with diseases that mimicked leprosy. A series of patients had hypopigmented {{areas of the}} skin that resembled <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy, but {{did not have the}} loss of sensation associated with leprosy lesions. Meyers biopsied these and through his collaborations with the AFIP discovered the adult form of Mansonella streptocerca.|$|E
50|$|By contrast, {{two forms}} of {{positive}} reactions are seen when <b>tuberculoid</b> or borderline cases of HD are assessed by the lepromin test. (There are three borderline diagnoses possible {{as well as the}} <b>tuberculoid</b> and lepromatous diagnoses in the Ridley-Jopling classification system. The severity of disease and thus assignment to one of the five diagnoses is related to the strength of the cell mediated immune response.) The Fernandez (early) reaction appears within two days and is roughly equivalent in nature and underlying mechanism to the response seen in tuberculosis patients reacting positively to the tuberculin test. Induration of 5mm or more with erythema (redness), or 10mm without, 48 hours post injection are positive Fernandez reactions. Unlike the tuberculin test however, another reaction occurs in lepromatous patients at the injection site 21 days post injection, also appearing as induration and possible ulceration. This late positive reaction is known as the Mitsuda reaction. These reactions differ dependent on the type of lepromin antigen used.|$|E
5000|$|The Fernandez {{reaction}} is a reaction that occurs to signal a positive {{result in the}} lepromin skin test for leprosy. The reaction occurs in the skin {{at the site of}} injection if the body possesses antibodies to the Dharmendra antigen, one of the antigens found in Mycobacterium leprae, the bacteria that causes leprosy. The reaction occurs via a delayed-type hypersensitivity mechanism. This reaction occurs within 48 hours of injection of lepromin and is seen in both lepromatous and <b>tuberculoid</b> forms of leprosy. In contrast, the Mitsuda reaction occurs 5-6 weeks after injection of lepromin and is only seen in patients with the <b>tuberculoid</b> form of leprosy (not the lepromatous form, in which the body does not mount a strong response against the bacterium). In terms of mechanism of action and appearance, the {{reaction is}} similar to the tuberculin reaction of a positive Mantoux test for tuberculosis. (Note that lepra reactions are different) ...|$|E
5000|$|Infections: Unilateral {{madarosis}} (only one eye) {{may occur}} in <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy from granulomatous infiltration of hair follicles ultimately destroying them. Infections like syphilis by causing a moth-eaten {{appearance of the}} eyebrow hair loss. Viral infections like herpes or HIV can cause scarring of the eyelid, causing loss of hair. Various fungal infections like paracoccidioidomycosis can cause lesions {{and changes in the}} hair locations of the eyelid.|$|E
5000|$|Granuloma multiforme (also {{known as}} [...] "Mkar disease" [...] and [...] "granuloma multiforme (Leiker)") is a {{cutaneous}} condition most commonly seen in central Africa, and rarely elsewhere, characterized by skin lesions {{that are on}} the upper trunk and arms in sun-exposed areas. It may be confused with <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy, with which it has clinical similarities. The condition was first noted by Gosset in the 1940s, {{but it was not until}} 1964 that Leiker coined the term to describe [...] "a disease resembling leprosy" [...] in his study in Nigeria.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, wanting to {{discover}} “why in certain diseases the macrophages, after ingesting pathogens, not only fail {{to kill them}} but instead provide a hospitable environment for them to thrive, multiply, and reactivate disease,” and thus develop therapies, Cohn {{and other members of}} his team began visiting hospitals in Brazil, and later in Colombia, Ethiopia, India, Nepal, and the Philippines, to study patients with leprosy and various other diseases, including tuberculosis and AIDS. “For some reason,” Cohn said in a 1983 interview, “no one had ever really looked very hard at the local skin lesions of leprosy patients. Diagnosis has usually been based on analysis of cells in the blood stream. So when we first went to Brazil, we decided that we would examine the cells in the skin. In the virulent lepromatous lesions we found bacteria-filled macrophages together with a large number of suppressor T cells. As we studied patients in the intermediate stages of the disease and on to the <b>tuberculoid</b> form, we found that the number of so-called helper cells began to increase relative to the number of suppressor T cells.” ...|$|E
40|$|Sera from {{patients}} with lepromatous and <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy {{were examined in}} immunoblot assays for antibodies to Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture filtrate antigens. Antibodies to 30 - and 31 -kilodalton proteins were present in 88 and 81 %, respectively, of 16 patients with lepromatous disease and absent in 16 patients with <b>tuberculoid</b> disease. Antibodies to a 32 -kilodalton protein were found in 12 and 38 % of lepromatous and <b>tuberculoid</b> patients, respectively. These reactivities may be useful for distinguishing lepromatous and <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The "racket" lesion {{is a rare}} {{presentation}} of <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy, which consists of a thickened nerve branch emerging from a <b>tuberculoid</b> plaque. It results from centripetal damage to cutaneous nerves caused by granuloma formation. We describe a typical case of <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy presenting as a "racket" lesion. The lesion persisted after treatment with paucibacillary multidrug therapy...|$|E
40|$|A 5 -year-old contact of a lepromatous leprosy {{patient with}} a <b>tuberculoid</b> lesion on the {{anterior}} aspect of the shaft of the penis is reported. The child was clinically suspected to have borderline <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy during a survey of contacts of leprosy patients, which on histopathology revealed features of subpolar <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy. The father of the child was recently detected as a case of lepromatous leprosy and was started on multibacillary regime of WHO multidrug therapy. The reason for the localization of the lesion to the shaft of the penis is also suggested. Skin as a route of transmission of <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy is also emphasized...|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} 400 {{patients}} of leprosy comprising of 188 patients of <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy, {{was carried out}} to assess the type and extent of uveal involvement.

40|$|The blastogenic {{response}} of leucocyte cultures from patients with <b>tuberculoid</b> and lepromatous leprosy has been studied. The leucocytes {{from the two}} groups were studied simultaneously and cultivated in the same pool of normal human serum. While the leucocytes from twenty-eight <b>tuberculoid</b> patients responded quite strongly to Mycobacterium leprae after 7 days of culture (average lymphocyte transformation 11 · 1 %), there was a complete lack of response in similar cultures from twenty-seven lepromatous patients (average 0 · 1 % transformed cells). These results were confirmed by studies on cellular incorporation of 3 H-thymidine in the cultures from four <b>tuberculoid</b> and four lepromatous patients...|$|E

40|$|A {{sensitive}} specific radioimmunoassay {{was developed}} to measure antibodies against BCG antigen 60, a prominent antigenic component of BCG bacilli which cross-reacts with similar components in many mycobacterial species including Mycobacterium leprae and M tuberculosis. A lepromatous serum pool had anti-BCG- 60 activity with a titre of 10 (5) and the <b>tuberculoid</b> pool a titre of 10 (4). Testing of individual sera showed striking variations within groups of patients with lepromatous and <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy. In five of the 20 <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy sera the anti-BCG- 60 activity was above the median for the lepromatous group. The current view that antibody formation against mycobacterial antigens is very low in <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy thus no longer appears to be tenable. Sera from eight patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis also showed a striking variation in anti-BCG- 60 content, and the median value of this group was even higher than in those with lepromatous leprosy...|$|E
40|$|Quantitation of {{interleukin}} 1 {{production by}} adherent mononuclear cells from peripheral blood {{was performed in}} patients with <b>tuberculoid</b> and lepromatous forms of leprosy. Cells from patients with <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy either secreted interleukin 1 spontaneously or produced amounts within the normal range in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Conversely, stimulated cells from lepromatous patients failed to produce interleukin 1 in 5 of 13 (38. 5 %) cases...|$|E
40|$|Background: In leprosy, {{there is}} a range of varied clinicopathologic manifestations and the {{diagnosis}} is made from adequate clinical information combined with bacilloscopy and histopathology which helps in diagnosing different types of leprosy and separating it from other granulomatous lesions. Aim {{of the study was}} to classify leprosy according to Ridley Jopling classification and perform the clinicopathological correlation. Materials and Methods: A cross sectional comparative study of skin biopsies of newly diagnosed leprosy recieved over a period of 18 months from January 2009 to June 2010 and clinicopathologic correlation was done along with special stain. Results: This study included 75 patients diagnosed clinically as leprosy. Skin biopsy revealed evidence of leprosy in 72 cases. Maximum number of patient clinically belonged to <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy which constituted 25 (33 %) cases followed by borderline <b>tuberculoid</b> 19 (25. 33 %). On the contrary, histologically borderline <b>tuberculoid</b> was the most common type (40 %, n= 30) cases and <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy constituted (13. 33 %, n= 10) cases. Three cases of clinically diagnosed <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy showed no features of leprosy histologically. Clinical and histopathological correlation was seen in 34 cases (45. 33 %). The correlation was highest in borderline <b>tuberculoid</b> (63. 15 %) followed by borderline lepromatous and lepromatous leprosy. Slit skin smear was positive in 31 cases (43. 05 %). Fite Farraco stain was positive in 18 cases (25 %). Conclusion: The classification of leprosy requires attention to the histopathological criteria and correlation with clinicalinformationand bacteriological examination so as to facilitate accurate therapy to prevent undesirable complication.

40|$|Twenty-three leprosy {{patients}} {{have been studied}} in an endemic area before institution of chemotherapy. These were comprised of ten lepromatous leprosy, four borderline lepromatous and nine <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy cases on basis of clinical features, bacteriological and marphological indices. Histopathology of skin biopsies classified two as truly polar lepromatous leprosy (LL) and three as polar <b>tuberculoid</b> (TT), while the remaining eighteen were at various stages of evolution towards lepromatous or <b>tuberculoid</b> end of the spectrum. All lepromatous and borderline leprosy patients showed negative delayed hypersensitivity reaction with lepromin, but six out of fourteen patients in this category gave positive reaction with PPD. Blast transformation with PHA of peripheral leucocytes from all cases of lepromatous leprosy cultured in standard AB serum was depressed in comparison with cells from normal controls. 3 H-thymidine incorporation in DNA of leucocytes in presence of leprolin was lower in cells of lepromatous leprosy group as compared to those from <b>tuberculoid</b> and borderline cases. There was lack of production of macrophage aggregation factor in all except one case of lepromatous leprosy while the test for this factor was positive {{for most of the}} <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy patients. The homing characteristics of lymphocytes tagged with 51 Chromium into liver and spleen of test mice were altered from the normal pattern in a large number of leprosy cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} between HLA specificities and leprosy {{was investigated in}} a Southern Brazilian population. One hundred and twenty-one patients and 147 controls were typed for HLA-A, B, Cw, DR and DQ. Patients were subdivided into the following subgroups, according to clinical, histological and immunological criteria: lepromatous (N = 55), <b>tuberculoid</b> (N = 32), dimorphous (N = 20), and indeterminate (N = 14). The frequencies of HLA specificities were compared between the total group of patients and controls, and between the same controls and each subgroup of patients. After correction of the probabilities, deviations were not significant, except for the DR 2 specificity, which presented a frequency of 44. 2 % in the total group of patients and 56. 3 % in the subgroup of individuals with the <b>tuberculoid</b> form of the disease, compared to 23. 3 % in the controls. Stratified analysis showed that the increased DR 2 frequency in the total group of patients {{was due to the}} subgroups with the <b>tuberculoid</b> and dimorphous forms. The relative risk of <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy for DR 2 -positive individuals was 4. 2, and the etiologic fraction of DR 2 was 0. 429. In conclusion, a positive association of the DR 2 specificity with the <b>tuberculoid</b> form of leprosy, but not with the lepromatous, dimorphous, or indeterminate forms, was demonstrated in this Southern Brazilian populatio...|$|E

In 21 % with <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy and in 62 % with lepromatous leprosy leprous granulomata {{were found in the}} liver. A significant prevalence of granulomatous lesions in the liver among patients with <b>tuberculoid</b> and borderline-tuberculoid leprosy of less than one year's duration suggests that bacillaemia occurs early in all forms of leprosy...|$|E
40|$|Leprosy is a {{spectral}} {{disease with}} polar lepromatous and <b>tuberculoid</b> forms correlating with enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immunity, respectively, against Mycobacterium leprae and the borderline forms, borderline lepromatous, midborderline, and borderline <b>tuberculoid</b> showing in-between clinical and immunological characteristics. Histopathologically, the cellular infiltrates of leprosy lesions show predominantly {{the presence of}} interacting T-cells and antigen presenting cells like macrophages, whereas the presence of B-cells has only been sporadically reported. The present study demonstrates by immunohistochemical techniques the presence of B-cells, including plasma cells, in active lesions from lepromatous leprosy, skin smear negative borderline lepromatous, and paucibacillary borderline <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the in situ production of M leprae-specific antibodies from BT lesions using an organotypic skin explant culture model. Finally, analysis of the cytokine release profile in supernatants of lesional organotypic skin cultures showed a microenvironment conducive to the differentiation and maturation of B-cells. The results demonstrate the presence of different functionally active B-cell stages within lesions of patients with leprosy, including borderline <b>tuberculoid</b> patients, which could secrete anti-M leprae-specific antibodies. However, their role in leprosy pathology remains to be elucidate...|$|E
40|$|Background: Leprosy has a broad {{spectrum}} of clinical manifestations. Clinical information along with Bacterial evidence is necessary to achieve accurate diagnosis. The present study was carried out to nd out clinical and bacterial correlation in various presentations according to Ridley Jopling classi cation of Hansen’s Disease. Materials and Methods: It was a hospital based cross-sectional comparative study of 72 leprosy patients over a period of 1 year and it’s clinico-Bacterial correlation was done with the help of Slit Skin Smear and clinical classi cation. Results: This study included 72 leprosy patients at various stages according to Ridley Jopling classi cation. Maximum cases belonged to Borderline <b>Tuberculoid</b> leprosy 28 (38. 88 %) followed by <b>Tuberculoid</b> leprosy 15 (20. 83 %). Slit Skin Smear showed 12 (42. 85 %) of Borderline <b>Tuberculoid</b> and 3 (20 %) of <b>Tuberculoid</b> cases had disparity and didn’t match corresponding clinical subtype.

40|$|Strong {{development}} of <b>tuberculoid</b> {{features in the}} late stage of cutaneous leishmaniasis presents immunopathological, diagnostic and sometimes therapeutic problems. Only two such cases were identified out of 30 late-stage cases of the disease. They were delineated on histological and immunocytological grounds, and found to present higher levels of Leishmania antigen {{and lower levels of}} IgG than the weakly <b>tuberculoid</b> cases. One case showed histological and skin test evidence of delayed-type hypersensitivity; the other case (clinically of the relapsing or recidiva variety) lacked such evidence. Here the residual antigen was segregated at the periphery of the lesion. In three late-stage cases for which lymph node biopsies were available there was a stronger <b>tuberculoid</b> response in lymph node or lymphatic than in the skin lesion. In two cases there was caseation. Germinal follicles were notably active. It is suggested that in cutaneous leishmaniasis a strong <b>tuberculoid</b> response may be associated not so much with immune complex formation (as in the majority of lesions) but with sequestration of antigen at a peripheral site or in the lymphatic apparatus...|$|E
40|$|Soluble {{interleukin}} 2 receptors (IL- 2 R) in sera of leprosy {{patients from}} Chiang Mai, Thailand, were quantified {{with a solid}} phase enzyme immunoassay using two monoclonal antibodies to the IL- 2 R. The IL- 2 R levels of untreated lepromatous, borderline lepromatous or midborderline patients and treated lepromatous and borderline lepromatous or treated borderline <b>tuberculoid</b> and <b>tuberculoid</b> patients were {{comparable to those of}} the Thai household or nonhousehold contacts; and they were significantly higher than the levels of USA control subjects. In contrast, IL- 2 R of untreated <b>tuberculoid</b> or borderline <b>tuberculoid</b> patients were significantly reduced. Patients with ongoing reversal reaction had very high circulating IL- 2 R, the levels of which correlated with fever and extent of skin lesions. Although erythrema nodosum leprosum patients also had elevated IL- 2 R levels, they were significantly below those of patients with reversal reaction. When treated with corticosteroid, precipitous reduction of IL- 2 R was noted in all patients with reversal reaction but not in patients with erythema nodosum leprosum...|$|E
40|$|T cell {{responses}} play {{a critical}} role in determining protective responses to leprosy. Patients with self-limiting <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy show high T cell reactivity, while patients with disseminated lepromatous form of the disease show absent to low levels of T cell reactivity. Since the T cell reactivity of lepromatous patients to purified protein derivative (PPD), a highly cross-reactive antigen, is similar to that of <b>tuberculoid</b> patients, we queried if lepromatous patients could recognize cross-reactive epitopes in Mycobacterium leprae antigens as well. T cell responses were analysed to a recombinant antigen 10 -kD (a heat shock cognate protein) which is available from both M. tuberculosis (MT) and M. leprae (ML) and displays 90 % identity in its amino acid sequence. Lymphoproliferative responses were assessed to ML and MT 10 kD in newly diagnosed leprosy patients (lepromatous, n = 23; <b>tuberculoid,</b> n = 65). Lepromatous patients showed similar, but low, lymphoproliferative responses to ML and MT 10 kD, while <b>tuberculoid</b> patients showed much higher responses to ML 10 kD. This suggests that the <b>tuberculoid</b> patients may be recognizing both species-specific and cross-reactive epitopes in ML 10 kD, while lepromatous patients may be recognizing only cross-reactive epitopes. This was further supported by linear regression analysis. Lepromatous patients showed a high concordance in T cell responses between ML and MT 10 kD (r = 0. 658; P 0. 1). Identification of cross-reactive T cell epitopes in M. leprae which could induce protective responses should prove valuable in designing second generation peptide-based vaccines...|$|E
