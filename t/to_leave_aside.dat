If it is not historically true that such and such things happened in Palestine eighteen centuries ago, what becomes of Christianity? And what is historical truth but that of which the evidence bears strict scientific investigation? I do not call to mind any problem of natural science which has come under my notice which is more difficult, or more curiously interesting as a mere problem, than that of the origin of the Synoptic Gospels and that of the historical value of the narratives which they contain. The Christianity of the Churches stands or falls by the results of the purely scientific investigation of these questions. They were first taken up in a purely scientific spirit just about a century ago; they have been studied over and over again by men of vast knowledge and critical acumen; but he would be a rash man who should assert that any solution of these problems, as yet formulated, is exhaustive. The most that can be said is that certain prevalent solutions are certainly false, while others are more or less probably true. {414} ...|$|E

5000|$|Badruddin and his {{elder brother}} Cumruddin were deeply {{involved}} in the founding of the Indian National Congress, although they were unable to attend its first session in 1885. Tyabji held the Indian National Congress in high regard, stating, [...] "I have always regarded it Presidentship as the highest honor." [...] Tyabji was instrumental in building the national scope of the Congress by working to gain support from both Hindus and Muslims. In response to criticisms that Muslims should boycott the Congress, Tyabji declared that he had [...] "denounced all communal and sectarian prejudices." [...] To further conciliate Muslims and bring them into the Congress fold, Tyabji introduced Resolution No. XIII at the 1888 Allahabad Congress. It stated, [...] "That no subject shall be passed for discussion by the Subject Committee, or allowed to be discussed at any Congress...to the introduction of which the Hindu or Mahomedan Delegates as a body object...provided that this rule shall refer only to subjects in regard to which the Congress has not already definitely pronounced an opinion." [...] This measure was introduced with intention of appealing to Muslims by limiting the scope of Congress activities to only those items that both Muslims and Hindus agreed upon. Despite these overtures, many Muslim leaders were still skeptical of Congress's ability to represent them. Chief among these critics was Syed Ahmad Khan, who in an open letter to Tyabji, wrote, [...] "I ask my friend Budruddin Tyabji <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>aside</b> those insignificant points in the proposals of the Congress in which Hindus and Mahomedans agree (for there are no things in the world which have no points in common -- there are many things in common {{between a man and a}} pig), and to tell me what fundamental political principles of the Congress are not opposed to the interests of Mahomedans." [...] Despite these criticisms, Tyabji continued to believe in Congress as a capable institution for forwarding the collective interests as Indians as a whole. In his capacity within Congress, Tyabji set the example for cross-communal cooperation. In his Presidential Address to the 1887 Madras Congress, Tyabji reassured members of his faith, stating, [...] "I, at least, not merely in my individual capacity but as representing the Anjuman-i-Islam of Bombay, do not consider that there is anything whatever in the position or the relations of the different communities of India -- be they Hindus, Musalmans, Parsis, or Christians -- which should induce the leaders of any one community to stand aloof from the others in their efforts to obtain those great general reforms, those great general rights, which are for the common benefit of us all; and which, I feel assured, have only to be earnestly and unanimously pressed upon Government to be granted to us." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} the author {{discusses}} how, despite an overall improvement of infra-structure, {{there has been}} no corresponding improvement in the quality of ’illness care’. Non-medical professionals like sociologists and economists have stayed away from participating in the health sector, and there is a similar absence of concern for the non-medical components of health by the medical community.

Given the situation, the author calls for economists and members of the medical profession to join forces in order to provide effective health and medical care to all. The medical profession feels that life is too precious a commodity to be measured in terms of money.

Findings are presented, firstly, of the gravity of noun phrase errors, such as those relating to pronouns and articles. Secondly, I discuss the gravity of certain pragmatic infelicities such as over-explicitness (e. g. use of a lexical noun where a pronoun is appropriate).

40|$|Background: A {{number of}} recent papers have {{cast doubt on the}} {{applicability}} of the quasispecies concept to virus evolution, and have argued that population genetics is a more appropriate framework to describe virus evolution than quasispecies theory. Results: I review the pertinent literature, and demonstrate for a number of cases that the quasispecies concept is equivalent to the concept of mutation-selection balance developed in population genetics, and that there is no disagreement between the population genetics of haploid, asexually-replicating organisms and quasispecies theory. Conclusion: Since quasispecies theory and mutation-selection balance are {{two sides of the same}} medal, the discussion about which is more appropriate to describe virus evolution is moot. In future work on virus evolution, we would do good to focus on the important questions, such as whether we can develop accurate, quantitative models of virus evolution, and <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>aside</b> discussions about the relative merits of perfectly equivalent concepts...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{evaluates the}} effects of fiscal {{discretion}} in a currency area, where a common and independent monetary authority commits to optimally set the union-wide nominal interest rate. National governments implement fiscal policy by choosing government expenditure. The assumption of fiscal policy coordination across countries is retained in order to evaluate the costs exclusively due <b>to</b> discretion, <b>leaving</b> <b>aside</b> the free-riding problems stemming from noncooperation. In such a context, nominal rigidities potentially generate a stabilization role for fiscal policy, {{in addition to the}} one of ensuring efficient provision of public goods. However, it is showed that, under discretion, aggregate fiscal policy stance is inefficiently loose and the volatility of government expenditure is higher than optimal. As an implication, the optimal monetary policy rule involves the targeting of union-wide fiscal stance, on top of inflation and output gap. The result questions the welfare enhancing role of government expenditure, as the proper instrument for stabilizing asymmetric shocks. In fact, discretion entails significant welfare costs, the magnitude depending on the stochastic properties of the shocks and, for plausible parameter values, it is not optimal to use fiscal policy as a stabilization tool...|$|R
