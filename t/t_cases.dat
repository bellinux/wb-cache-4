40|$|In the WHO Leprosy BCG Trial in Burma a mass {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine whether}} children {{had been exposed to}} patients with leprosy and, if so, the form of the index case. This paper presents the most important epidemiological data collected in this survey. The prevalence rate was 31. 6 per 1 000. It seems that even if the prevalence rate is very high the L rate does not increase accordingly. The high T rates in areas of high endemicity seem to be related mainly to the degree of spreading of leprosy, even to persons who react to lepromin. Comparison of the results with data available for the area before the survey was made shows that 87 % of the L cases had already been detected and that 54 % of the <b>T</b> <b>cases</b> had not. There was a tendency for high L rates to be associated with high prevalence rates. The results do not suggest that any particular age group has greater susceptibility or resistance; the prevalence rates seemed to be related mainly to the age when exposure occurred. A higher prevalence of leprosy in males started to appear in the 10 - 14 -year age group, and after the age of 15 the difference became impressive. Biological, socio-economic, and environmental factors seem to be responsible for the level of endemicity, which {{does not seem to be}} essentially or primarily related to ethnic origin...|$|E
40|$|Background: Frontotemporal {{dementia}} and parkinsonism {{linked to}} chromosome 17 (FTDP- 17) {{is associated with}} mutations in the Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau(MAPT) gene or the Progranulin(PGRN) gene. MAPT mutations lead to widespread deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (FTDP- 17 T). PGRN mutations are associated with ubiquitin- and TDP- 43 -positive inclusions in the frontotemporal cortex, striatum and hippocampus (FTDP- 17 U). Despite the differences, FTDP- 17 T and FTDP- 17 U share a largely overlapping clinical phenotype. Objective: To determine whether neuroimaging studies may allow an in vivo early differentiation between FTDP- 17 T and FTDP- 17 U. Methods: We studied 25 individuals affected with FTDP- 17 T associated with either the exon 10 + 3 (24 subjects) or the G 335 S (1 subject) MAPT mutation, as well as 3 FTDP- 17 U individuals, who were carriers of the A 9 D, IVS 6 - 2 A>G or R 493 X PGRN mutation. Neuroimaging studies, obtained along {{the course of the}} disease, were compared to the neuropathologic findings. Results: FTDP- 17 <b>T</b> <b>cases</b> were associated with symmetric frontotemporal atrophy. Behavioral changes constituted the predominant clinical presentation. Conversely, an asymmetric degenerative process was seen in all 3 PGRN cases, who presented with either corticobasal syndrome (A 9 D) or frontotemporal dementia and language deterioration (IVS 6 - 2 A>G and R 493 X). Conclusion: Neuroimaging data, in the early disease stage of FTDP- 17, may offer the possibility of an early differentiation of FTDP- 17 T and FTDP- 17 U phenotypes, independent of the genetic analysis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Visual {{navigation}} is {{a challenging}} issue in automated robot control. In many robot applications, like object manipula-tion in hazardous environments or autonomous locomotion, {{it is necessary}} to automatically detect and avoid obstacles while plan-ning a safe trajectory. In this context the detection of corridors of free space along the robot trajectory is a very important capabil-ity which requires nontrivial visual processing. In m <b>t</b> <b>cases</b> it is possible {{to take advantage of the}} active control of the cameras. In this paper we propose a cooperative schema in which mo-tion and stereo vision are used to infer scene structure and de-termine free space areas. Binocular disparity, computed on sev-eral stereo images over time, is combined with optical flow from the same sequence to obtain a relative-depth map of the scene. Both the time-to-impact and depth scaled by the distance of the camera from the fixation point in space are considered as good, relative measurements which are based on the viewer, but cen-tered on the environment. The need for calibrated parameters is considerably reduced by using an active control strategy. The cameras track a point in space independently of the robot motion and the full rotation of the head, which includes the unknown robot motion, is derived from binocular image data. The feasibility of the approach in real robotic applications is demonstrated by several experiments performed on real image data acquired from an autonomous vehicle and a prototype cam-era head.

This framework would be particularly useful in the evaluation of de-noising and constrained reconstruction techniques. Given MRI raw data, lower field MRI acquisitions can be simulated based on the signal and noise scaling with field strength. Certain assumptions are imposed for the simulation and their validity is discussed. A validation experiment was performed using a standard resolution phantom imaged at 0. 35 T, 1. 5 T, 3 T, and 7 T. This framework was then applied to two sample proton-density weighted MRI applications that demonstrated estimation of minimum field strength requirements: real-time upper airway imaging and liver proton-density fat fraction measurement. The phantom experiment showed good agreement between simulated and measured images. The SNR difference between simulated and measured was ≤ 8 % for the 1. 5 T, 3 T, and 7 <b>T</b> <b>cases</b> which utilized scanners with the same geometry and from the same vendor. The measured SNR at 0. 35 T was 1. 8 - to 2. 5 -fold less than predicted likely due to unaccounted differences in the RF receive chain. The predicted minimum field strength requirements for the two sample applications were 0. 2 T and 0. 3 T, respectively. Under certain assumptions, low-field MRI acquisitions can be simulated from high-field MRI data. This enables prediction of the minimum field strength requirements for a broad range of MRI techniques...|$|E

40|$|The immunogenetic {{factors that}} {{influence}} susceptibility to pneumonia are poorly understood. Recent studies suggest an association of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) polymorphisms with increased susceptibility to some infections. Here, we examined whether polymorphisms in TLR 4 influence susceptibility to Legionnaires' disease (LD) by using a case-control study to compare the allele frequencies of two SNPs (A 896 G and C 1196 <b>T).</b> <b>Cases</b> (n = 108) were obtained from a LD outbreak in The Netherlands in 1999. Controls were exposed at the same outbreak, did not develop pneumonia, and were either unmatched (n = 421) or matched (n = 89) to patients for age, sex, and geographic residence. Allele 896 G was associated with LD susceptibility with a frequency of 6. 5 % in the combined control group (matched and unmatched) vs. 2. 5 % in patients [odds ratio (OR) of 0. 36, 95 % confidence interval (C. I.) 0. 14 – 0. 91, P = 0. 025]. In the matched control group comparison, allele 896 G also showed a protective association with an OR of 0. 27 (95 % C. I. 0. 09 – 0. 75, P = 0. 008). An analysis of genotype frequencies (896 AA vs. AG and GG) demonstrated similar protective associations (patient vs. combined control group comparison, OR = 0. 35, 95 % C. I. 0. 14 – 0. 89, P = 0. 02; matched control group comparison, OR = 0. 25, 95 % C. I. 0. 09 – 0. 71, P = 0. 006). Allele 1196 T cosegregated with allele 896 G and, thus, had identical associations.

40|$|The thesis investigates three panel data models. For each model, {{we tend to}} use a multifactor struc-ture {{to capture}} the {{cross-sectional}} dependence and the correlation between regressors and errors. We focus on providing results which are available to the large N and small <b>T</b> <b>cases</b> (say T< 10). There {{is no doubt that}} our set-ups violate the basic requirements of the ordinary least squares (OLS), nonlinear least squares (NLS) and two stage least squares (TSLS) estimators. Therefore, we provide alternative consistent estimators in each corresponding chapter and investigate their as-ymptotic properties. Since we never take a large T average, the complexities of the joint large N and T limits are bypassed and the assumptions on the time dimension are relaxed. In Chapter 3, we focus on the cases with homogeneous and heterogeneous slopes. Relevant mo-ments conditions and three corresponding estimators are given. Also, we show that three estimators have nice asymptotic properties for both homogeneous and heterogeneous slopes models. Since they all can be expressed in closed form, it is very easy to apply these estimators to the real data sets. Furthermore, we show that tests on the interest parameters can be constructed using standard t- and F- procedures. Then we follow Su and Jin (2012) and propose a single index panel data model in Chapter 4. Even though our model is less general than the nonparametric version in Su and Jin (2012), we believe it is a nice compromise between applicability and generality. In this chapter, some corresponding identification issues are addressed and a new estimation procedure is presented by using sieve estimation. To explain the new procedure clearly, we use NLS estimator as a benchmark. The numerical results show that our semiparametric estimator is close enough to the NLS estimator while we do not have too much information on the interest function. Finally, in Chapter 5, we introduce the multifactor structures to the structural equation panel data model. As we see, the existence of the multifactor structure causes the inconsistent estimation for the tradi-tional limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) and two stage least squares (TSLS) meth-ods. However, under proper transformation, we still can employ LIML and TSLS estimators to gain the consistent estimation and show that these two estimators are asymptotically identical. For the LIML estimator, we express the asymptotic results in an easy representation. The Monte Carlo studies are presented in each chapter to back up our theoretical results...|$|E
