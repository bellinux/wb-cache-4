5000|$|From mid-2007 to mid-2008, MSNBC {{received}} a large increase in its ratings. Primetime viewings increased by 61% over that time. In May 2008, NBC News president Steve Capus said that [...] "It {{used to be}} people didn't {{have to worry about}} MSNBC because it was an also-ran cable channel.... That's not the case anymore." [...] <b>Tim</b> <b>Russert's</b> sudden death in June 2008 removed what The Wall Street Journal called the [...] "rudder for the network" [...] and led to a period of transition.|$|R
50|$|All {{three floors}} of the {{building}} offer exhibits, including the Rotary Gallery (featuring elaborate model trains), the Pioneer Gallery, the Erie County Room, the State Court, the Community Gallery, Native American Gallery, Neighbors, and Bflo Made.

The exhibit can be viewed during the normal business hours of the Buffalo History Museum.|$|R
25|$|At the February debate, <b>Tim</b> <b>Russert</b> of NBC News {{was criticized}} for what some {{perceived}} as disproportionately tough questioning of Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton. Among the questions, Russert had asked Clinton, but not Obama, to provide {{the name of the}} new Russian President (Dmitry Medvedev). This was later parodied on Saturday Night Live. In October 2007, liberal commentators accused Russert of harassing Clinton over the issue of supporting drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants.|$|E
25|$|At {{a debate}} of Democratic presidential {{candidates}} in Philadelphia on October 30, 2007, NBC's <b>Tim</b> <b>Russert</b> cited {{a passage from}} a book by Shirley MacLaine in which the author writes that Kucinich had seen a UFO {{from her home in}} Washington State. Russert asked if MacLaine's assertion was true. Kucinich confirmed and emphasized that he merely meant he had seen an unidentified flying object, just as former U.S. president Jimmy Carter had. Russert then cited a statistic that 14% of Americans say they have witnessed a UFO.|$|E
25|$|On April 11, 2007, Steve Capus of NBC News, {{announced}} that MSNBC {{would no longer}} simulcast Imus in the Morning, effective immediately. While the decision came {{on the same day}} that a few advertisers left Imus, the network also said employee concerns played a role. Sen. (and at the time presidential candidate) Barack Obama, and several high-profile NBC black personalities, including Al Roker previously a friendly guest on the show, opposed Imus's return. The absence and silence from Imus's frequent NBC guests Brian Williams, Andrea Mitchell, David Gregory, Chris Matthews and close friend <b>Tim</b> <b>Russert</b> was too obvious to ignore and foreshadowed NBC's future action.|$|E
5000|$|Russert {{is buried}} at Rock Creek Cemetery, {{next to the}} {{historic}} Soldiers' Home, in Washington's Petworth neighborhood. The Newseum in Washington, D.C., exhibited a re-creation of Russert's office with original elements such as his desks, bookshelves, folders, loose leaf papers and notebooks. In August 2014, the exhibit was disassembled at the Newseum and transported to the Buffalo History Museum.

25|$|For instance, {{for people}} with known {{atherosclerosis}} diseases, the 2004 updated American Heart Association, NIH and NCEP recommendations are for LDL levels to be lowered to less than 70nbsp&mg/dL, unspecified how much lower. This low level of less than 70nbsp&mg/dL (higher than <b>Tim</b> <b>Russert's</b> value shortly prior to his heart attack) was recommended for primary prevention of 'very-high risk patients' and in secondary prevention as a 'reasonable further reduction'. Lack of evidence for such a recommendation is discussed {{in an article in}} the Annals of internal medicine. It should also be noted that statin drugs involved in such clinical trials have numerous physiological effects beyond simply the reduction of LDL levels.|$|R

25|$|He {{was hired}} by NBC News' Washington bureau the {{following}} year and became bureau chief by 1989. Russert assumed the job of host of the Sunday morning program Meet the Press in 1991, and would become the longest-serving host of the program. Its name was changed to Meet the Press with <b>Tim</b> <b>Russert,</b> and, at his suggestion, went to an hour-long format in 1992. The show also shifted to a greater focus on in-depth interviews with high-profile guests, where Russert was known especially for his extensive preparatory research and cross-examining style. One approach he developed was to find old quotes or video clips that were inconsistent with guests' more recent statements, present them on-air to his guests and then ask them to clarify their positions. With Russert as host the show became increasingly popular, receiving more than four million viewers per week, and it was {{recognized as one of}} the most important sources of political news. Time magazine named Russert one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008, and Russert often moderated political campaign debates.|$|E
500|$|Biden {{declared}} his candidacy for president on January 31, 2007, after having discussed running for months prior, and first made a formal announcement to <b>Tim</b> <b>Russert</b> on Meet the Press on January 7, stating he would [...] "be the best Biden I can be." [...] In January 2006, Delaware newspaper columnist Harry F. Themal wrote that Biden [...] "occupies the sensible {{center of the}} Democratic Party." [...] Themal concludes {{that this is the}} position Biden desires, and that in a campaign [...] "he plans to stress the dangers to the security of the average American, not just from the terrorist threat, but from the lack of health assistance, crime, and energy dependence on unstable parts of the world." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 13, 2008, {{upon the}} death of NBC News Washington Bureau Chief and Meet the Press {{moderator}} <b>Tim</b> <b>Russert,</b> who was a proud Buffalo native, Brown ordered that all flags on city property be lowered to half-staff in order to honor Russert's memory. Brown called Russert one of Buffalo's finest ambassadors, and his decision to lower the flags in honor of Russert, a civilian who never held elected office, was an unusual gesture that was described as breathtaking on Hardball with Chris Matthews by Tom Brokaw. He was joined by several other officials in recognizing Russert. [...] Chief among those was United States President George W. Bush who signed a bill that named a stretch of U.S. Route 20A that passes in front of Ralph Wilson Stadium (home stadium of the Buffalo Bills) Timothy J. Russert Highway.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} on NBC's Meet the Press, Farrakhan said the following in response to host <b>Tim</b> <b>Russert's</b> question on the Nation of Islam's teachings on race: [...] You know, it's not unreal to believe that white people — who genetically cannot produce yellow, brown or black — had a Black origin. The scholars and scientists of this world agree that the origin of man and humankind started in Africa and that the first parent {{of the world was}} black. The Qur'an says that God created Adam out of black mud and fashioned him into shape. So if white people came from the original people, the Black people, what is the process by which you came to life? That is not a silly question. That is a scientific question with a scientific answer. It doesn't suggest that we are superior or that you are inferior. It suggests, however, that your birth or your origin is from the black people of this earth: superiority and inferiority is determined by our righteousness and not by our color. Pressed by Russert on whether he agreed with Elijah Muhammad's preaching that whites are [...] "blue-eyed devils", Farrakhan responded: [...] Well, you have not been saints in the way you have acted toward the darker peoples of the world and toward even your own people. But, in truth, Mr. Russert, any human being who gives themself over to the doing of evil could be considered a devil. In the Bible, in the [...] "Book of Revelation", it talks about the fall of Babylon. It says Babylon is fallen because she has become the habitation of devils. We believe that that ancient Babylon is a symbol of a modern Babylon, which is America.|$|R
500|$|Throughout April, {{the draft}} efforts continued, and Perot {{appeared}} on talk shows, discussing his plans and positions on political issues. During {{an appearance on}} Larry King Live, Perot stated that he was closer to a decision on a potential campaign, {{and that he was}} willing to spend $100 million of his own money to finance it. On the Today Show he was interviewed by Katie Couric, and proposed to cut Medicare and Social Security for [...] "people who don't need it". He appeared on Face the Nation later in the month, and argued that wealthy Americans should spend more than average Americans to eliminate the budget deficit. His budget numbers were contested by <b>Tim</b> <b>Russert</b> on Meet the Press, during a heated interview, after which, a frustrated Perot considered dropping out of the race. [...] C-SPAN ran a speech by Perot, where he announced that he hoped to run a campaign without [...] "political pros" [...] to avoid the [...] "dirty tricks" [...] of past campaigns. After this appearance, campaign consultant Raymond Strother explained to Perot that professionals such as pollster Mark Penn were essential to a successful campaign. In late April, Perot hired former Chicago Tribune editor James Squires as press spokesman to handle the large volume of interview requests from the media. At the end of the month, Perot realized that he had spent too much time visiting talk shows, and announced that he would spend his next few weeks focusing on the issues.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the evening}} of his death, the entire, nearly commercial-free half-hour of NBC Nightly News was {{dedicated}} to Russert's memory. [...] Bill and Hillary Clinton released a joint statement saying Russert [...] "had a love of public service and a dedication to journalism that rightfully earned him the respect and admiration of not only his colleagues but also {{those of us who}} had the privilege to go toe to toe with him." [...] Many of his colleagues in both newspaper and television reporting also offered tribute to Russert in this and other programs. Other major news agencies, including CBS, ABC, CNN, Fox News, and the BBC spent large segments of their programming on June 13 reporting about Russert's life and career. President George W. Bush stated in a news conference with French president Nicolas Sarkozy: [...] "America lost a really fine citizen yesterday when <b>Tim</b> <b>Russert</b> passed away. I’ve had the privilege of being interviewed by <b>Tim</b> <b>Russert.</b> I found him to be a hardworking, thorough, decent man. And <b>Tim</b> <b>Russert</b> loved his country, he loved his family, and he loved his job a lot." [...] Bruce Springsteen, a friend of Russert's, gave an on-stage tribute to him while performing in Cardiff, Wales, on June 14 and again at Russert's televised Kennedy Center memorial service, calling him [...] "an important irreplaceable voice in American journalism" [...] and offering condolences to his family. [...] On the June 13, 2008, episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien, O'Brien simply walked onto the stage {{at the start of the}} show. Instead of his usual upbeat antics and monologue, O'Brien announced that he had just received news about the sudden death of his good friend, fellow NBC employee and frequent Late Night guest <b>Tim</b> <b>Russert.</b> O'Brien proceeded to show two clips of his favorite Russert Late Night moments.|$|E
