5|$|Golf is very popular, {{and golf}} tourism {{is a major}} {{industry}} attracting more than 240,000 golfing visitors annually. The 2006 Ryder Cup was held at The K Club in County Kildare. Pádraig Harrington became the first Irishman since Fred Daly in 1947 to win the British Open at Carnoustie in July 2007. He successfully defended his title in July 2008 before going on to win <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> Championship in August. Harrington became the first European to win <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> Championship in 78 years {{and was the first}} winner from Ireland. Three golfers from Northern Ireland have been particularly successful. In 2010, Graeme McDowell became the first Irish golfer to win the U.S. Open, and the first European to win that tournament since 1970. Rory McIlroy, at the age of 22, won the 2011 U.S. Open, while Darren Clarke's latest victory was the 2011 Open Championship at Royal St. George's.

5|$|Similar to {{the other}} majors, the tournament {{consists}} of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three {{for the first two}} rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like <b>the</b> <b>PGA.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Taplow Club {{gathering}} {{initiated a}} series of several meetings {{over the next several}} months and, on 10 April 1916, <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> of America was officially established with 35 charter members. Wanamaker proposed that the newly formed organization hold an annual tournament, and offered to donate money for a trophy and prize fund. That October, the first annual PGA Championship took place at the Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville, New York. James M. Barnes defeated Jock Hutchison in the championship match, taking home the Wanamaker Trophy and $2,580 as his share of the purse.|$|E

25|$|Hobens was one {{of seven}} chosen {{to make up the}} {{original}} organizing committee and one of three professionals who wrote <b>the</b> <b>PGA's</b> first constitution and by-laws. The committee met several times at Hotel Martinique in Manhattan before the constitution, fashioned on <b>the</b> British <b>PGA,</b> was approved on 10 April 1916 when their first business was conducted. <b>The</b> first <b>PGA</b> Championship was held in 1916 at the Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville, New York, and Jim Barnes—after defeating Jock Hutchison in the final match—hoisted the Wanamaker Trophy.|$|R
5|$|The reigning {{champion}} of the competition is automatically invited {{to play in the}} other three majors (Masters, the U.S. Open, and <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> Championship) for the next five years. The prize of the tournament is the Golf Champion Trophy, commonly known as the Claret Jug, and the champion personally keeps the trophy until the next competition the following year. The champion also receives a gold medal, which they are allowed to keep permanently. Until 1870 the champion received the Challenge Belt, however when Tom Morris Jr. (more commonly known as Young Tom Morris) won the Open Championship three times in a row he won the belt outright, necessitating the need for a new trophy.|$|E
5|$|Woods had a poor showing at the 2013 U.S Open as {{a result}} of an elbow injury {{sustained}} at The Players Championship. In finishing at 13-over-par, he recorded his worst score ever as a professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner Justin Rose. After a prolonged break because of the injury, during which he missed the Greenbrier Classic and his own AT National, he returned at the Open Championship at Muirfield. Despite being in contention all week and beginning the final round only two strokes behind Lee Westwood, he struggled with the speed of the greens and could only manage a 3-over-par 74 that left him tied for 6th place, five strokes behind eventual winner Phil Mickelson. Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15-year history. His second round 61 matched his record score on <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> Tour and could easily have been a 59 were it not for some short missed birdie putts on the closing holes. This gave him a seven stroke lead that he held onto for the rest of the tournament. Woods would never contend at <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> Championship at Oak Hill Country Club and would come short of winning a major for the 5th full season, only contending in two of the four majors in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Woods {{turned pro}} in August, 1996 and {{immediately}} signed advertising deals with Nike, Inc. and Titleist that ranked {{as the most}} lucrative endorsement contracts in golf history at that time. Woods was named Sports Illustrateds 1996 Sportsman of the Year and PGA Tour Rookie of the Year. In April 1997, {{he won his first}} major, the Masters, in record-breaking fashion and became the tournament's youngest-ever winner at age 21. Two months later, he set the record for the fastest-ever ascent to No. 1 in the Official World Golf Rankings. After a lackluster 1998, Woods finished the 1999 season with eight wins, including <b>the</b> <b>PGA</b> Championship, a feat not achieved since 1974.|$|E
50|$|Aronimink gained media notoriety when it withdrew {{itself from}} plans to host <b>the</b> 1993 <b>PGA</b> Championship because it didn't have any current or {{prospective}} African-American members or applicants {{before the start}} of the tournament. The club has since met all of <b>the</b> <b>PGA's</b> minority membership requirements and has hosted both a senior PGA and a USGA event since 1993.|$|R
