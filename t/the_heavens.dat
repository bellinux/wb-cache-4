The Mahabharata also records {{at the time}} of the chakra-musala war, Krishna's Kaumodaki along with other weapons appear in human form from <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> to watch the battle.

Balarama uses the plough and the club called Saunanda; while Krishna battles with Kaumodaki and the bow Sharanga.|$|E

5000|$|Tushita or Tusita {{is one of}} the six deva-worlds of the Kamadhatu, {{located between}} <b>the</b> Yama <b>heaven</b> and <b>the</b> Nirmanarati <b>heaven.</b> Like <b>the</b> other <b>heavens,</b> Tusita is said to be {{reachable}} through meditation. It is <b>the</b> <b>heaven</b> where <b>the</b> Bodhisattva Svetaketu (Pali: Setaketu [...] "White Banner") resided before being reborn on Earth as Gautama Buddha, the historical Buddha; it is, likewise, <b>the</b> <b>heaven</b> where <b>the</b> bodhisattva Natha ("Protector") currently resides, who will later be born as the next Buddha, Maitreya.|$|R
5|$|The Maya {{viewed the}} cosmos as highly structured; there were {{thirteen}} levels in <b>the</b> <b>heavens,</b> and nine {{levels in the}} underworld; the mortal world occupied a position between <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> and the underworld. Each level had four cardinal directions associated with a different colour. Major deities had aspects associated with these directions and colours; north was white, east was red, south was yellow, and west was black.|$|E

After fighting Razban, a demon bent on bringing Nelgel to life, the protagonist forges a friendship with a young boy who knew the secret to using the Ark of <b>the</b> <b>Heavens.</b> Returning to the present, the protagonist entered Nelgel's lair, and after a long battle, emerged successful.

5|$|Deities {{were present}} {{not only in}} <b>the</b> <b>heavens,</b> {{but also in the}} human body itself. They were {{responsible}} for maintaining the body's five viscera, guarding the registers of life, and regulating the souls. There were five internal deities that were particularly important in Lingbao Daoism. The Great Unity lived in the head, along with Lordling and White Prime, who could descend into the liver and lungs. The Director of Destinies lived in the heart and sexual organs, and finally, the Peach Child lived in the lower dantian. Normally these deities resided in <b>the</b> <b>heavens,</b> but they could be activated by scriptural recitations to descend into the body.|$|E

The {{consensus}} of modern scholarship is that Snorri's elves are based on angels and demons of Christian cosmology.|$|E

5|$|Some western {{scholars}} {{hold that}} the Isra and Mi'raj journey traveled through <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> from the sacred enclosure at Mecca to the celestial al-Baytu l-Maʿmur (heavenly {{prototype of the}} Kaaba); later traditions indicate Muhammad's journey as having been from Mecca to Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The 19th-century German {{classical}} scholar Erwin Rohde viewed Orion as {{an example}} of the Greeks erasing the line between the gods and mankind. That is, if Orion was in <b>the</b> <b>heavens,</b> other mortals could hope to be also.|$|E

50|$|Cicero says “Hicetas of Syracuse, as Theophrastus says, {{holds that}} <b>the</b> <b>heaven,</b> <b>the</b> sun, the moon, {{the stars and}} in fact all things in the sky remain still, and nothing else in the {{universe}} moves, except the earth; but as the earth turns and twists about its axis with extreme swiftness, all the same results follow as if the earth were still and <b>the</b> <b>heaven</b> moved". This is of course not well expressed…but Cicero means {{no more than that}} the rotation of the earth is a complete substitute for the apparent daily rotation of <b>the</b> <b>heaven</b> as a whole.|$|R

5|$|The Chronologia {{developed}} into an even wider project, the Cosmographia, {{a description of}} the whole Universe. Mercator's outline was (1) the creation of the world; (2) the description of <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> (astronomy and astrology); (3) the description of the earth comprising modern geography, the geography of Ptolemy and the geography of the ancients; (4) genealogy and history of the states; and (5) chronology. Of these the chronology had already been accomplished, the account of the creation and the modern maps would appear in the atlas of 1595, his edition of Ptolemy appeared in 1578 but the ancient geography and the description of <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> never appeared.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of a woman writing {{in the press and}} composing poetry in this dark era was a significant event.

5|$|Zhao Shaung's 3rd-century {{commentary}} in the Zhoubi suanjing describes two astronomical theories: in one, <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> {{are shaped}} as a hemi-spherical dome extending over the earth, {{while the other}} compares the earth to the central yolk of an egg, where <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> are shaped as a celestial sphere around the earth. The latter astronomical theory was mentioned by Yang Xiong in his Model Sayings (Fayan 法言) and expounded on by Zhang Heng in his Spiritual Constitution of the Universe (Lingxian 靈憲) of 120 CE. Thus, the Han-era Chinese believed in a geocentric model for the immediate solar system and greater universe, {{as opposed to a}} heliocentric model.|$|E
