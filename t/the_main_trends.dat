2500|$|Rallying {{himself with}} <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>trends</b> of Jewish existentialism, the poet {{remained}} critical of other existentialist schools, {{such as those}} of Martin Heidegger and Jean-Paul Sartre, believing them to be overly reliant on dialectics, and therefore on rational thought; likewise, citing Kierkegaard as his reference point, Fondane criticized Jean Wahl for not discussing existential philosophy as an act of faith. His dislike for secular existentialism was also outlined in a text he authored shortly before his 1944 arrest, where he spoke of the Bible as being, [...] "whether or not it wants to", the original reference for all existential philosophy. Geneviève Tissier-Fondane later recalled that her husband was [...] "profoundly Jewish" [...] to his death, but also that he would not abide by any formal regulation within the Halakha tradition. This approach also implied a measure of ecumenism: Jacques Maritain, who cultivated his relationship with Fondane across the religious and philosophical divides, described his friend as [...] "a disciple of Shestov but one inhabited by the Gospel"; Fondane himself explained to Maritain that Shestov and himself were aiming for a new Judaic philosophy that would be equally indebted to the Christianity of Kierkegaard, Martin Luther and Tertullian. He was critical of Maritain's worldview, but remained a passionate reader of his work; in contrast, Geneviève attested that the Maritains' beliefs shaped her own, leasing her back into the Church.|$|E

However, the storage volume series from a data center is always “dirty,” which contains the noise, missing data, and outliers, so it is necessary to extract <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>trend</b> of storage volume series for the future prediction processing. In this paper, we propose an irregular sampling estimation method to extract <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>trend</b> of <b>the</b> time series, in which the Kalman filter is used to remove the “dirty” data; then the cubic spline interpolation and average method are used to reconstruct <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>trend.</b> <b>The</b> developed method is applied in the storage volume series of internet data center. The experiment results show that the developed method can estimate <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>trend</b> of storage volume series accurately and make great contribution to predict the future volume value...|$|R
