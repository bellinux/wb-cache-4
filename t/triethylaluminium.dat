25|$|Pyrophoric flares {{work on the}} {{principle}} of ejecting a special pyrophoric material out of an airtight cartridge, usually using a gas generator, e.g. a small pyrotechnic charge or pressurized gas. The material then self-ignites in contact with air. The materials can be solid, e.g. iron platelets coated with ultrafine aluminium, or liquid, often organometallic compounds; e.g. alkyl aluminium compounds, e.g. <b>triethylaluminium.</b> Pyrophoric flares may have reduced effectiveness at high altitudes, due to lower air temperature and lower availability of oxygen; however oxygen can be co-ejected with the pyrophoric fuel.|$|E

5000|$|The Ziegler alcohol {{synthesis}} involves oligomerization of ethylene using <b>triethylaluminium</b> {{followed by}} oxidation.1 [...] The <b>triethylaluminium,</b> the Ziegler catalyst, is synthesized by action of aluminum, ethylene, and hydrogen gas.

The number of equivalents of ethylene n equals {{the total number of}} monomer units being grown on the initial ethylene chains, where (n = x + y + z), and x, y, and z are the number of ethylene units per chain. Trialkylaluminium is oxidized with air to form aluminum alkoxides, and finally hydrolyzed to aluminum hydroxide and the desired alcohols.|$|E
