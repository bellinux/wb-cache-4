25|$|In Hungary, the police, {{the public}} {{prosecutor}} or the court (depending on what individual cases require) appoints a criminal defender at the state's cost to defend <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> afford a chosen lawyer.

Usually a private lawyer is appointed, one for each defendant, and conflict of interest between contradicting suspects is avoided, e.g. the same lawyer may not represent two accused whose evidence is mutually contradictory. If convicted, the defendant is in principle liable for the fee, but is rarely pursued.|$|E

60|$|Undoubtedly Sherman, in the desolation he inflicted {{after leaving}} Atlanta, acted not in {{contravention}} of orders; and all, {{in a military}} point of view, if by military judged deemed to have been expedient, and nothing can abate General Sherman's shining renown; his claims to it rest on no single campaign. Still, there are <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> but contrast some of the scenes enacted in Georgia and the Carolinas, {{and also in the}} Shenandoah, with a circumstance in a great Civil War of heathen antiquity. Plutarch relates that in a military council held by Pompey and the chiefs of that party which stood for the Commonwealth, it was decided that under no plea should any city be sacked that was subject to the people of Rome. There was this difference, however, between the Roman civil conflict and the American one. The war of Pompey and Caesar divided the Roman people promiscuously; that of the North and South ran a frontier line between what for the time were distinct communities or nations. In this circumstance, possibly, and some others, may be found both the cause and the justification of some of the sweeping measures adopted.|$|E

60|$|It may, perhaps, be said, that a {{constitution}} which gives equal influence, man for man, {{to the most}} and to the least instructed, is nevertheless conducive to progress, because the appeals constantly made to the less instructed classes, the exercise given to their mental powers, and the exertions which the more instructed are obliged to make for enlightening their judgment and ridding them of errors and prejudices, are powerful stimulants to their advance in intelligence. That this most desirable effect really attends the admission of the less educated classes to some, and even to {{a large share of}} power, I admit, and have already strenuously maintained. But theory and experience alike prove that a counter current sets in when they are made the possessors of all power. Those who are supreme over every thing, whether they be One, or Few, or Many, have no longer need of the arms of reason; they can make their mere will prevail; and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be resisted are usually far too well satisfied with their own opinions to be willing to change them, or listen without impatience to any one who tells them that they are in the wrong. The position which gives the strongest stimulus to the growth of intelligence is that of rising into power, not that of having achieved it; and of all resting-points, temporary or permanent, in the way to ascendancy, the one which develops the best and highest qualities is the position of those who are strong enough to make reason prevail, but not strong enough to prevail against reason. This is the position in which, according to the principles we have laid down, the rich and the poor, the much and the little educated, and all the other classes and denominations which divide society between them, ought as far as practicable to be placed; and by combining this principle with the otherwise just one of allowing superiority of weight to superiority of mental qualities, a political constitution would realize that kind of relative perfection which is alone compatible with the complicated nature of human affairs.|$|E

6000|$|... § 3. I am {{inclined}} {{to think that this}} error is almost wholly an effect of the associations with a word, {{and that it would be}} prevented, by forbearing to employ, for the expression of the simple fact of causation, so extremely inappropriate a term as Necessity. That word, in its other acceptations, involves much more than mere uniformity of sequence: it implies irresistibleness. Applied to the will, it only means that, the given cause will be followed by the effect, subject to all possibilities of counteraction by other causes; but in common use it stands for the operation of those causes exclusively which are supposed too powerful to be counteracted at all. When we say that all human actions take place of necessity, we only mean that they will certainly happen if nothing prevents; when we say that dying of want, to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> get food, is a necessity, we mean that it will certainly happen whatever may be done to prevent it. The application of the same term to the agencies on which human actions depend, as is used to express those agencies of nature which are really uncontrollable, can not fail, when habitual, to create a feeling of uncontrollableness in the former also. This, however, is a mere illusion. There are physical sequences which we call necessary, as death for want of food or air; there are others which, though as much cases of causation as the former, are not said to be necessary, as death from poison, which an antidote, or the use of the stomach-pump, will sometimes avert. It is apt to be forgotten by people’s feelings, even if remembered by their understandings, that human actions are in this last predicament: they are never (except in some cases of mania) ruled by any one motive with such absolute sway that there is no room for the influence of any other. The causes, therefore, on which action depends, are never uncontrollable; and any given effect is only necessary provided that the causes tending to produce it are not controlled. That whatever happens, could not have happened otherwise, unless something had taken place which was capable of preventing it, no one surely needs hesitate to admit. But to call this by the name Necessity is to use the term in a sense so different from its primitive and familiar meaning, from that which it bears in the common occasions of life, as to amount almost to a play upon words. The associations derived from the ordinary sense of the term will adhere to it in spite of all we can do; and though the doctrine of Necessity, as stated by most who hold it, is very remote from fatalism, it is probable that most necessitarians are fatalists, more or less, in their feelings.|$|E

Data were collected from secondary sources through annual reports and statistical bulletin of Central Bank of Nigeria. Electronic banking was measured using the total value of internet and mobile banking while growth was measured using the value of total deposits and total assets of deposit money banks in Nigeria. A total deposit was regressed on internet and mobile banking, while a total asset was regressed on internet and mobile banking using multiple regression technique. The study revealed that positive relationships exist between mobile banking and total deposits, and between internet banking and total asset while on the other hand, no significant relationships between internet banking and total deposits, and between mobile banking and total asset. It is therefore recommended that banks that want to improve their deposit growth performance must offer numerous products/services through mobile phones in an effective, efficient and cost effective manner. They must also make mobile banking application all mobile phones enabled so that <b>those</b> customers <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> afford Java enabled mobile phones can also use the product.
