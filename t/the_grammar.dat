40|$|A {{factorial}} typology {{is a set}} of grammars. We are {{not given}} <b>the</b> <b>grammars</b> directly, but must deduce them from the way that the posited constraints deal with the posited structures. How do we know that the candidate sets we have examined are sufficient to discriminate all <b>the</b> <b>grammars</b> that are allowed by our assumptions? This is the problem of finding a universal support for a typology. Without a universal support, we don’t have the typology, and without the typology, many types of systematic claims about it must languish unjustified. Here we show how the universal status of a proposed support may be established when we have exact descriptions of the types of optima allowed in <b>the</b> <b>grammars.</b> If a typology is factored into (intensional) ranking properties in the sense of Alber & Prince (in prep.), and if the property values are associated with (extensional) characteristics carried by optima, then a grammar as a combination of values is associated with a description of its optima as a conjunction of the characteristics associated with the values. If the descriptions thereby obtained uniquely denote single candidates, then <b>the</b> <b>grammars</b> cannot be further refined, and the support that produced <b>the</b> <b>grammars</b> must be universal...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{outlines}} {{a hybrid}} architecture for a partial parser based on regular grammars over XML documents.

Each grammar determines not only the constituent structure (plus some syntactic dependencies internal to the structure), but also a description of the local and global context of the recognized phrase. <b>The</b> <b>grammars</b> available to <b>the</b> parser are arranged in a network. The order of <b>the</b> <b>grammars</b> application depends on the initial ordering in the network and the descriptions associated with <b>the</b> <b>grammars.</b> Thus <b>the</b> traverse is not deterministic. Additionally, the application of <b>the</b> <b>grammars</b> can be interleaved with the applications of other XML tools like remove, insert and transform operations. This architecture provides a flexible means for guiding the linguistic analysis in order to utilize all the available linguistic knowledge and to produce a very accurate partial analysis...|$|R
