40|$|The {{solution}} of the global controllability problem is obtained for a class of the <b>triangular</b> <b>systems</b> of O. D. E. that are not feedback linearizable. The introduced class is a generalization of the classes of <b>triangular</b> <b>systems</b> investigated before. The {{solution of}} the problem is based on the approach proposed in another work [18] devoted to the <b>triangular</b> <b>systems</b> of the Volterra equations and written jointly with W. H. Schmidt by the current authors. This yields the same properties of the considered class of <b>triangular</b> <b>systems</b> as those established in [18] for the Volterra systems. As well as in [18], for the current class of <b>triangular</b> <b>systems,</b> it is proven that there exists a family of continuous controls that solve the global controllability problem for the considered class and continuously depend on the initial and the terminal states. As well as in [18], this implies the global controllability of the bounded perturbations of the current class. In contrast with [18], to prove the existence of the desired family of open-loop controls, we construct a family of closed-loop ones each of which steers the corresponding initial state into an appropriate neighborhood of an appropriate terminal point.
