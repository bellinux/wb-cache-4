5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis littoralis (Linnaeus, 1789)– was {{described}} from brackish water by Linnaeus {{as a separate}} species, originally named Nerita littoralis. A study by Zettler (2008) proved that {{its status as a}} subspecies is unjustified, being regarded as a synonym of Theodoxus fluviatilis. Although these so-called forms (form fluviatilis and form littoralis) differ in morphology, ecology, reproductive strategy and behaviour, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> just ecomorphs.|$|E
5|$|Archidermaptera is {{believed}} to be sister to the remaining earwig groups, the extinct Eodermaptera and the living suborder Neodermaptera (= former suborders Forficulina, Hemimerina, and Arixeniina). The extinct suborders have tarsi with five segments (unlike the three found in Neodermaptera) as well as unsegmented cerci. No fossil Hemimeridae and Arixeniidae are known. Species in Hemimeridae were at one time in their own order, Diploglassata, Dermodermaptera, or Hemimerina. Like most other epizoic species, there is no fossil record, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> no older than late Tertiary.|$|E
5|$|By 1978, nine {{distinct}} rings were identified. Two additional rings {{were discovered}} in 1986 in images taken by the Voyager 2 spacecraft, and two outer rings were found in 2003–2005 in Hubble Space Telescope photos. In the order of increasing distance from the planet the 13 known rings are designated 1986U2R/ζ, 6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, λ, ε, ν and μ. Their radii range from about 38,000km for the 1986U2R/ζ ring to about 98,000km for the μ ring. Additional faint dust bands and incomplete arcs may exist between the main rings. The rings are extremely dark—the Bond albedo of the rings' particles does not exceed 2%. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> composed of water ice {{with the addition of}} some dark radiation-processed organics.|$|E
50|$|Palaeomolgophis is an extinct genus of eel-like prehistoric amphibian. Their limbs {{are much}} reduced, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> <b>were</b> fully aquatic.|$|R

5|$|Many {{mammalian}} serpins {{have been}} identified that share no obvious orthology with a human serpin counterpart. Examples include numerous rodent serpins (particularly some of the murine intracellular serpins) {{as well as the}} uterine serpins. The term uterine serpin refers to members of the serpin A clade that are encoded by the SERPINA14 gene. Uterine serpins are produced by the endometrium of a restricted group of mammals in the Laurasiatheria clade under the influence of progesterone or estrogen. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> not functional proteinase inhibitors and may function during pregnancy to inhibit maternal immune responses against the conceptus or to participate in transplacental transport.|$|E
5|$|Study of Saturn's moons {{has also}} been aided by {{advances}} in telescope instrumentation, primarily the introduction of digital charge-coupled devices which replaced photographic plates. For the entire 20th century, Phoebe stood alone among Saturn's known moons with its highly irregular orbit. Beginning in 2000, however, three dozen additional irregular moons have been discovered using ground-based telescopes. A survey starting in late 2000 and conducted using three medium-size telescopes found thirteen new moons orbiting Saturn at a great distance, in eccentric orbits, which are highly inclined to both the equator of Saturn and the ecliptic. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> fragments of larger bodies captured by Saturn's gravitational pull. In 2005, astronomers using the Mauna Kea Observatory announced the discovery of twelve more small outer moons, in 2006, astronomers using the Subaru 8.2m telescope reported the discovery of nine more irregular moons, in , Tarqeq (S/2007 S 1) was announced and in May {{of the same year}} S/2007 S 2 and S/2007 S 3 were reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings are}} made of an {{extremely}} dark material. The geometric albedo of the ring particles does not exceed 5–6%, while the Bond albedo is even lower—about 2%. The rings particles demonstrate a steep opposition surge—an increase of the albedo when the phase angle is close to zero. This means that their albedo is much lower when they are observed slightly off the opposition. The rings are slightly red in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum and grey in near-infrared. They exhibit no identifiable spectral features. The chemical composition of the ring particles is not known. However, they cannot be made of pure water ice like the rings of Saturn because they are too dark, darker than the inner moons of Uranus. This indicates that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> composed of a mixture of the ice and a dark material. The nature of this material is not clear, {{but it may be}} organic compounds considerably darkened by the charged particle irradiation from the Uranian magnetosphere. The rings' particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially {{similar to that of the}} inner moons.|$|E

25|$|The {{plasma protein}} binding of {{dydrogesterone}} and 20α-DHD are unknown, {{but based on}} the plasma protein binding of other progestins, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> bound to albumin and not to sex hormone-binding globulin or corticosteroid-binding globulin.|$|E
25|$|The Bayan Shireh {{material}} {{may or may}} {{not belong}} to this genus, and needs further study. One cladistic analysis showed that the two sets of specimens group together exclusive of any other taxa, so <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> at least closely related, if not the same species.|$|E
25|$|The centers {{make their}} {{appearance}} at the upper parts of the segments, and proceed gradually downward. To these may be added the occasional existence of two small episternal centers, which make their appearance one {{on either side of}} the jugular notch; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> vestiges of the episternal bone of the monotremata and lizards.|$|E

50|$|<b>They</b> <b>were</b> {{small mammals}} of about 15 cm long, with a tail of equal length. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> nocturnal, eating insects and fruits.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} a foundation myth connecting Odysseus with Italy is the lines surviving in Hesiod's Theogony (1011ff.), which report that Odysseus and Circe had two sons Agrius and Latinus, who ruled over the Etruscans (Tyrsenoi). Latinus is an important figure in many early Italian myths. The lines are not in fact Hesiodic, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> no later than the 6th century BC.|$|E
25|$|Back at {{the staging}} area Daniels relays the {{ballistics}} report to Freamon. The guns {{found in the}} car are clean of prints and do not match to any shootings. Freamon suggests that a trace DNA match or a witness could break the case, but that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> facing a lengthy investigation. Freamon asks Daniels how he chose the staging area and learns that he once went to school there.|$|E
25|$|Black-footed smallish marine shags of Europe and {{southern}} Africa. Wahlberg's cormorant is very tentatively placed here; it seems anatomically {{more similar to}} the P. fuscscens, but the more informative characters – the combination of frontal crest and lack of extensive naked skin at bill base in mid-sized Old World species – seem to place it here. If this is correct, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> very distantly related due to biogeography.|$|E
50|$|The {{context and}} {{prevailing}} circumstances {{in these two}} were important, especially as regards national security; indeed, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> decisive.|$|R

25|$|It is {{possible}} {{that it may be}} related to Cirroteuthis, and in that case the two posterior stumps, looking like arms, may be the remains of the lateral fins, for they seem too far back for the arms, unless pulled out of position. On the other hand, they seem to be too far forward for fins. So that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> arms twisted out of their true position.|$|E
25|$|The {{eastern end}} of a Romanesque church is almost always semi-circular, with either a high chancel {{surrounded}} by an ambulatory as in France, or a square end from which an apse projects as in Germany and Italy. Where square ends exist in English churches, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> influenced by Anglo Saxon churches. Peterborough and Norwich Cathedrals have retained round east ends in the French style. However, in France, simple churches without apses and with no decorative features were built by the Cistercians who also founded many houses in England, frequently in remote areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} Afrovenator were {{discovered}} in 1993 in the Tiourarén Formation {{of the department of}} Agadez in Niger. The Tiourarén was originally thought to represent the Hauterivian to Barremian stages of the early Cretaceous Period, or approximately 132 to 125 million years ago (Sereno et al. 1994). However, re-interpretation of the sediments showed that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> mid-Jurassic in age, dating Afrovenator to the Bathonian to Oxfordian stages, between 167 and 161 mya. The sauropod Jobaria, whose remains were first mentioned in the same paper which named Afrovenator, is also known from this formation.|$|E
50|$|Remingtonocetids {{are often}} found in {{association}} with catfish and crocodilians, as well as protocetid whales and sirenians. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> independent of freshwater.|$|R
50|$|The diet of oviraptorids is {{not fully}} understood. Though some {{appear to have been}} at least {{partially}} carnivorous, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> primarily herbivorous.|$|R

25|$|Harvestmen {{are very}} old arachnids. Fossils from the Devonian Rhynie chert, 410 million years ago, already show {{characteristics}} like tracheae and sexual organs, {{indicating that the}} group has lived on land since that time. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> {{closely related to the}} scorpions, pseudoscorpions, and solifuges; these four orders form the clade Dromopoda. The Opiliones have remained almost unchanged morphologically over a long period. Indeed, one species discovered in China, Mesobunus martensi, fossilized by fine-grained volcanic ash around 165 million years ago, is hardly discernible from modern-day harvestmen and has been placed in the extant family Sclerosomatidae.|$|E
25|$|Cuttlefish {{possess an}} {{internal}} structure called the cuttlebone, which is porous and {{is made of}} aragonite. The pores provide it with buoyancy, which the cuttlefish regulates by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the chambered cuttlebone via the ventral siphuncle. Each species' cuttlebone has a distinct shape, size, and pattern of ridges or texture. The cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, {{and is one of}} the features that distinguish them from their squid relatives. Jewellers and silversmiths traditionally use cuttlebones as moulds for casting small objects, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> better known as the tough material given to parakeets and other caged birds as a source of dietary calcium.|$|E
25|$|After {{separation}} of red cell membranes by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with periodic acid-Schiff staining (PAS) four glycophorins have been identified. These {{have been named}} glycophorin A, B, C and D in order of the quantity present in the membrane – glycophorin A being the most and glycophorin D the least common. A fifth (glycophorin E) has been identified within the human genome but cannot easily be detected on routine gel staining. In total the glycophorins constitute ~2% of the total erythrocyte membrane protein mass. Confusingly these proteins are also known under different nomenclatures but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> {{best known as the}} glycophorins.|$|E
