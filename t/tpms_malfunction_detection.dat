40|$|Abstract: When {{operating}} a control loop, the correct {{function of the}} controller depends on data usually acquired from a sensor. A problem may occur when the output information from the sensor is biased. Then <b>malfunction</b> <b>detection</b> of the sensor used for measuring the controlled variable can become a very important task. It is sometimes difficult to detect changes in {{the properties of the}} sensors, because they are not apparent from the control loop behaviour. Although biased sensor output information does not lead to a failure of the control function, we are faced with the problem that, although the control loop seems to be working properly, the consequences of a “small ” malfunction (sensor discredibility) can be substantial and expensive. It is easy to imagine, e. g. a combustion ratio control where deviations from an optimal ratio value have no principal influence on the operation of the device, but late discovery of an increase in harmful emissions may be very costly. Sensor redundancy may not be an acceptable solution if it requires expensive measuring equipment. This paper describes experiments on software sensor discredibility detection as a way that replaces usual hardware redundancy and saves the costs of additional measurements. It also shows the possibility of improving a controlled system by avoiding hidden impreciseness in the control loop operation. The used tools are methods of computational intelligence that are adapted and evaluated in an example application of a level control in a two-tank cascade.

This is not usually a case of total sensor failure, but the sensor starts to provide data that is not correct and thus not reliable for the controller. As will be shown, the problem is that such an incipient control variable sensor fault may lead to so-called control variable sensor discredibility: a specific and a barely detectable status, in which the indicated value of a control variable does not match its real value. However, this is not the only negative consequence, as undesirable side effects may sometimes occur and remain unrecognized. As will be shown, there may be unacceptable side effects. These are especially undesirable in bioenergetic processes, because they lead to an increase in harmful emissions.

The tasks of <b>malfunction</b> <b>detection</b> and daily monitoring are carried out by a mobile robot, which cruises along a dynamically planned route and carries an onboard camera to capture Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) images and read meters in the transformer environment.

BackgroundIn CF-LVAD patients, the dynamic interaction of device speed, left and right ventricular decompression, and valve function can be assessed during an echocardiography-monitored speed ramp test. MethodsWe devised a unique ramp test protocol to be routinely used {{at the time of}} discharge for speed optimization and/or if device malfunction was suspected. The patient's left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, frequency of aortic valve opening, valvular insufficiency, blood pressure, and CF-LVAD parameters were recorded in increments of 400 rpm from 8, 000 rpm to 12, 000 rpm. The results of the speed designations were plotted, and linear function slopes for left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, pulsatility index, and power were calculated. ResultsFifty-two ramp tests for 39 patients were prospectively collected and analyzed. Twenty-eight ramp tests were performed for speed optimization, and speed was changed in 17 (61 %) with a mean absolute value adjustment of 424 ± 211 rpm. Seventeen patients had ramp tests performed for suspected device thrombosis, and 10 tests were suspicious for device thrombosis; these patients were then treated with intensified anticoagulation and/or device exchange/emergent transplantation. Device thrombosis was confirmed in 8 of 10 cases at the time of emergent device exchange or transplantation. All patients with device thrombosis, but none of the remaining patients had a left ventricular end-diastolic dimension slope >− 0. 16.

40|$|Purpose: As all {{mechanical}} prostheses, bileaflet {{heart valves}} {{are prone to}} thrombus formation; reduced hemodynamic performances and embolic events can hence occur. Prosthetic valve thrombosis affects the power spectra calculated from the phonocardiographic signals corresponding to prostheses closing events. Artificial neural network-based classifiers are proposed for automatically and non-invasively assessing valve functionality and detecting thrombotic formations. Further studies will allow enlarging data set, extending the investigated frequency range, and applying the presented approach to other bileaflet mechanical valves. Methods: Data were acquired for the normofunctioning St. Jude Regent valve mounted in the aortic position of a Sheffield Pulse Duplicator. Different pulsatile flow conditions were reproduced, changing heart rate and stroke volume. The case of a thrombus completely blocking one leaflet was also investigated. Power spectra were calculated from the phonocardiographic signals and used to train artificial neural networks of different topologies; neural networks were then tested with the spectra acquired in vivo from 33 patients, all recipients of the St. Jude Regent valve in the aortic position. Results: The proposed classifier showed 100 % correct classification in vitro and 97 % when applied to in vivo data: 31 spectra {{were assigned to the}} right class, 1 was classified as false positive, and 1 as “not classifiable”. Conclusion: Early <b>malfunction</b> <b>detection</b> is necessary to prevent thrombotic events on bileaflet mechanical heart valves.
