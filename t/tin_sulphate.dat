40|$|The {{electrodeposition}} of tin, at {{a copper}} surface, from a <b>tin</b> <b>sulphate</b> (0 ˙ 014 mol dm– 3) electrolyte containing methanesulphonic acid (12 ˙ 5 vol. -%) at 295 K has been studied. Cyclic voltammetry, using potential sweep rates of 8 – 128 mV s– 1, at a stationary copper electrode provided {{information on the}} potential ranges for tin deposition and stripping. Linear sweep voltammetry, at a copper rotating disc electrode {{was used to evaluate}} the mass transport characteristics of the system under controlled, laminar flow conditions. The changes in the limiting current density with a Sn 2 + concentration of 0 ˙ 006 – 0 ˙ 078 mol dm– 3 and an electrode rotation rate of 200 – 4800 rev min– 1 were quantified. Randles-Sevčik and Levich equations were used to give an averaged diffusion coefficient for Sn 2 + of 5 ˙ 4 × 10 – 6 cm 2 s– 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper reports {{new insight}} in thermal {{synthesis}} of tin disulphide microplates, starting from sulfur and <b>tin</b> <b>sulphate,</b> under normal atmosphere and without assistance of template. New reaction mechanism, based on LUX-FLOOD's theory of acid and base, {{has been proposed}} to explain the formation of SnS 2 microplates. Temperatures of the reactions are 250 °C and 400 °C. The mixture of reactants was heated up for forty minutes. The resultant powder has been consequently washed and dried at 100 °C until constant mass. XRD, Elemental analysis and MEB reveal that, the product obtained at 250 °C consists of microplates of SnS 2 with thickness of about 412 nm and length ranging between 573 nm and 2. 27 μm. At 400 °C, the obtained product {{is a mixture of}} tin sulphide, tin oxide, sulfur, and unspecified phase. The presence of these phases is revealed by XRD and confirmed by thermal analysis. We have established that, tin disulphide cannot be considered as main product of reaction at 400 °C. Molten Sulfur acts as reaction medium and resembles molten salt, that makes possible oxidation of O 2 - ions and reduction of sulfur, whence the proposed reaction scheme...|$|E
40|$|Four {{commercial}} tubular membranes (AFC 80, AFC 30, PU 608, and ES 404) {{have been}} investigated in this study for their performance of binary metal ions rejection under different feed conditions. A range of salts (tin chloride, <b>tin</b> <b>sulphate,</b> calcium chloride, calcium sulphate) with divalent cations were chosen to assess the effects of different anions (chloride and sulphate) on performance of the membranes. All membranes were tested by varying the feed concentration (2500, 5000, 10, 000  mg L− 1) at fixed cross flow velocity of 1. 5 LPM and feed pressure 1400  kPa. Observed retention (Robs%) and permeate flux (Jv) were key parameters to evaluate the performance of studied tubular membranes. It was found that increase in concentration adversely affected the both evaluation parameters, i. e., permeate flux and rejection. Nevertheless, nanofiltration type tubular membranes (AFC 80 and AFC 30) showed higher rejection than their counterparts, i. e., ultrafiltration type tubular membranes (ES 404, PU 608) for all investigated salts. Maximum observed rejection for all salts was noted for AFC 80 for all salts followed by AFC 30, ES 404 and PU 608 tubular membranes. Furthermore, it is reveal that anion types (SO 42 −, Cl−) of these salts played {{a vital role in}} retention of these tubular membranes when the salts with same cations were used as feed solution...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, the pulse {{electrodeposition}} of <b>tin</b> from <b>sulphate</b> bath containing SnSO 4, H 2 SO 4, phenol sulphonic acid, gelatin and ß-napthol has been studied. The influences of pulsed current, duty cycle on the thickness, hardness and current {{efficiency of the}} tin deposit were studied. Electrochemical corrosion studies of the deposited tin on mild steel were conducted by potentiodynamic polarisation and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry studies using potential sweep of 10 mV s 21 provide information about the potential ranges for tin deposition and stripping. The tin deposit on a brass substrate has been investigated using XRD, SEM and AFM. The XRD analysis revealed that the tin plated is Sn(200) and crystalline. The morphology of tin deposit is a typical fine grained and granular structure as seen from SEM and AFM...|$|R
30|$|Aluminium (Al) {{sheet of}} 9  cm wide ×  160  cm long with a {{thickness}} of 0.02  cm {{was used as}} a substrate. It was followed by the anodization process, under suitable conditions calculated by the surface area of the samples. First, the aluminium sheet was degreased with a commercial cleaning solution, and then etched by NaOH solution, and immersed in 165  g/L sulphuric acid solution. The Al substrate was connected with an anode (+) and a lead plate was used as the cathode (−), and then a direct current of electrical density with 1000  A at the constant potential of 15 – 17  V at 20  °C was applied for 45  min to achieve the Al 2 O 3 film thickness of 9.1 – 9.5  µm. Subsequently, the formed Al 2 O 3 film was directly transferred to the colouring bath containing <b>tin</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> (SnSO 4). The Sn pigment was deposited into the pores of Al 2 O 3 film for 5, 7 and 10  min, which coded as Sn–Al 2 O 3 - 5, Sn–Al 2 O 3 - 7 and Sn–Al 2 O 3 - 10, respectively. Then, the porous Al 2 O 3 was sealed in a hot water tank at 50 – 60  °C for 30  min.|$|R
40|$|Electrolytic {{manganese}} dioxide (EMD) {{is one of}} the active materials in an alkaline {{manganese dioxide}} cell. Several researchers have looked upon to further enhance the rechargeability and cycle life of EMD. This study will look into the optimization of nickel deposition on EMD to further improve the conductivity of EMD. Electroless nickel depostion technique was employed for this purpose. This technique utilizes a plating bath consisting of solutions of sodium hypophosphite and sodium pyrophosphate as the reducing agent, nickel sulphate as the nickel source, tin chloride as a nucleating agent and catalysed by palladium chloride in an ultrasonic bath. The concentration of nickel <b>sulphate,</b> <b>tin</b> chloride and palladium chloride were varied to optimize the percentage of nickel doped. The resultant samples of nickel doped EMD were analyzed using SEM and EDAX techniques. It was found that variation of the concentration of the plating solutions greatly influenced the amount of nickel being doped...|$|R
40|$|In the {{research}} of new nanocomposite proton-conducting membranes, SnO 2 ceramic powders with surface functionalization have been synthesized and adopted as additives in Nafion-based polymer systems. Different synthetic routes have been explored to obtain suitable, nanometer-sized <b>sulphated</b> <b>tin</b> oxide particles. Structural and morphological characteristics, as well as surface and bulk properties of the obtained oxide powders, have been determined by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopies, N 2 adsorption, and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). In addition, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), atomic force microscopy (AFM), thermal investigations, water uptake (WU) measurements, and ionic exchange capacity (IEC) tests {{have been used as}} characterization tools for the nanocomposite membranes. The nature of the tin oxide precursor, as well as the synthesis procedure, were found {{to play an important role}} in determining the morphology and the particle size distribution of the ceramic powder, this affecting the effective functionalization of the oxides. The incorporation of such particles, having sulphate groups on their surface, altered some peculiar properties of the resulting composite membrane, such as water content, thermo-mechanical, and morphological characteristics. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland...|$|R
40|$|At present, {{a higher}} demand is put towards {{the use of}} natural dyes due to {{increased}} {{awareness of the environmental}} and health hazards associated with the synthesis and use of synthetic dyes. This research was conducted using onion outer skins as a potential source of natural plant dyes. In this study, extraction of dye was carried out in aqueous boiling method. Premordanting technique was followed using different mordants, namely alum, ferrous <b>sulphate,</b> <b>tin,</b> tannic acid, tartaric acid, and their combinations on silk fabric. Fabric samples dyed without using any mordant were then compared with the dyed samples pretreated with the mordants. The range of colors developed on dyed materials was evaluated by measuring the color values with respect to K/S values and color coordinates. It was concluded that the color values were found to be influenced by the addition of mordants, and thus different fashion hues were obtained from the same amount of dye extract using different mordants. Ferrous sulphate was found as the most influential mordant. ΔEcmc values between unmordanted (Reference dyed) and metallic mordanted fabric samples were found higher than those between unmordanted and nonmetallic mordanted fabric samples. The dyed samples were evaluated for color fastness to washing, light, drycleaning, rubbing, and perspiration. The color fastness properties were found to be satisfactory and improved in many cases. From the fastness results, it was obvious that these dyes can also be applied on silk fabric without using any mordant if required...|$|R
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 118 - 123). This thesis investigates parameters {{influencing the}} concentration of aqueous <b>tin</b> in acidic <b>sulphate</b> solutions containing Fe(III/II) as they arise in the Reduction Releach process at Teck Cominco Trail Operations (TCML). This study documents the impact of initial sulphuric acid and As(V) concentrations, temperature, and lead concentrate reductant amount on tin solubility in acidic Fe(III/II) sulphate solutions as they arise in an intermediate leaching step at TCML. Supporting test work examined the speciation of commercial tin bearing residues involved in the processing of indium and germanium. Analysis of these residues determined the oxidation state of crystalline tin in ZnO fume, Ge Preconcentrate, and Releach residue to be primarily Sn(IV), and associated with zinc, lead, and iron oxides; in addition to lead, iron, and aluminum silicates, and minor amounts of Sn(II) as SnO or SnSO₄. Experimental validation of Sn(II) solubility values in 100 g/L H 2 SO 4, between 30 to 90 °C, compared well with literature and theoretical tin solubility values. Measured tin solubility values ranged between 95 g/L Sn and 99 g/L Sn concentration. The aqueous tin concentration decreased slightly (4 g/L Sn) when the temperature was increased from 30 to 90 °C. Measured aqueous tin values for both thesis benchscale test work and commercial Reduction Releach process were all less than 1 g/L Sn. The oxidation rate of Sn(II) between 300 mg/L and 700 mg/L in 100 g/L H₂SO₄ at 20 °C, was first order kinetics with a rate constant ranging between 0. 0002 and 0. 0003 mg Sn/L∙s, and the REDOX potential (Eh) varied between 550 and 650 mV. The low rate constants {{may have been due}} to poor mass transfer. Iodometry could not be used for aqueous tin analysis with other divalent and trivalent cations present in solution and, therefore, inductive coupled plasma analysis was used...|$|R
