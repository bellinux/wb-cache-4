50|$|A thermal {{oxidizer}} (also known as thermal oxidiser, or <b>thermal</b> <b>incinerator)</b> {{is a process}} unit for air pollution control in many chemical plants that decomposes hazardous gases at a high temperature and releases them into the atmosphere.|$|E
40|$|This type of {{incinerator}} is {{also referred}} to as a thermal oxidizer, <b>thermal</b> <b>incinerator,</b> and afterburner; all “with heat exchangers. ” However, the term afterburner is generally appropriate only to describe a thermal oxidizer used to control gases coming from a process where combustion is incomplete. 2. Type of Technology: Destruction by thermal oxidation 3. Applicable Pollutants: Primarily volatile organic compounds (VOC). Some particulate matter (PM), commonly composed as soot (particles formed as a result of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons (HC), coke, or carbon residue) will also be destroyed in various degrees. 4. Achievable Emission Limits/Reductions: VOC destruction efficiency depends upon design criteria (i. e., chamber temperature, residence time, inlet VOC concentration, compound type, and degree of mixing) (EPA, 1992). Typical recuperative incinerator design efficiencies range from 98 to 99. 9999 % and above, depending on system requirements and characteristics of the contaminated stream (EPA, 1992; EPA, 1996 a).

40|$|There are {{hundreds}} of commercially installed SNCR systems {{on a wide range}} of boiler configurations including: dry bottom wall fired and tangentially fired units, wet bottom units, stokers, and fluidized bed units. These units fire a variety of fuels such as coal, oil, gas, biomass, and waste. Other applications include <b>thermal</b> <b>incinerators,</b> municipal and hazardous solid waste combustion units, cement kilns, process heaters, and glass furnaces. Emission Stream Characteristics: a. Combustion Unit Size: In the United States, SNCR has been applied to boilers and other combustion units ranging in size from 50 to 6, 000 MMBtu/hr (5 to 600 MW/hr) (EPA, 2002). Until recently, it was difficult to get high levels of NOx reduction on units greater than 3, 000 MMBtu (300 MW) due to limitations in mixing. Improvements in SNCR injection and control systems have resulted in high NO X reductions (> 60 %) on utility boilers greater than 6, 000 MMBtu/hr (600 MW). (ICAC, 2000). b. Temperature: The NO X reduction reaction occurs at temperatures between 1600 °F to 2100 °F (870 °C to 1150 °C) (EPA, 2002). Proprietary chemicals, referred to as enhancers or additives, can be added to the reagent to lower the temperature range at which the NO X reduction reactions occur. c. Pollutant Loading: SNCR tends to be less effective at lower levels of uncontrolled NO X. Typical uncontrolled NO X levels vary from 200 ppm to 400 ppm (NESCAUM, 2000). SNCR is better suited for applications with high levels of PM in the waste gas stream than SCR. d. Other Considerations: Ammonia slip refers to emissions of unreacted ammonia that result from incomplete reaction of the NO X and the reagent. Ammonia slip may cause: 1) formation of ammonium sulfates, which can plug or corrode downstream components, 2) ammonia absorption into fly ash, which may affect disposal or reuse of the ash, and 3) increased plum...|$|R
40|$|International Congress on Waste Stabilization and Environment 1999 Meeting, NATL INST APPL SCI, LYON, FRANCE, APR, 1999 International audienceMunicipal {{solid waste}} {{incinerator}} by products include fly ash {{and air pollution}} control residues. In order to transform these incinerator wastes into reusable mineral species, soluble alkali chlorides must be separated and toxic trace elements must be stabilized in insoluble form. We show that alkali chlorides can be extracted efficiently in an aqueous extraction step combining a calcium phosphate gel precipitation. In such a process, sodium and potassium chlorides are obtained free from calcium salts, and the trace metal ions are immobilized in the calcium phosphate matrix. Moderate calcination of the chemically treated fly ash leads {{to the formation of}} cristalline hydroxylapatite. Fly ash spiked with copper ions and treated by this process shows improved stability of metal ions. Leaching tests with water or EDTA reveal a significant drop in metal ion dissolution. Hydroxylapatite may trap toxic metals and also prevent their evaporation during <b>thermal</b> treatments. <b>Incinerator</b> fly ash together with air pollution control residues, treated by the combined chloride extraction and hydroxylapatite formation process may be considered safe to use as a mineral filler in value added products such as road base or cement blocks...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} work {{was carried out}} to investigate the feasibility of application of a sintering process to mixtures composed of Municipal Solid Waste Incinerator (MSWI) fly ash and low-cost additives (waste from feldspar production and cullet). The proportions of the three constituents were varied to adjust the mixture compositions to within the optimal range for sintering. The material was compacted in cylindrical specimens and treated at 1100 and 1150 # 1;C for 30 and 60 min. Engineering and environmental characteristics including weight loss,dimensional changes,density,open porosity, mechanical strength,chemical stability and leaching behavior were determined for the treated material,allowing {{the relationship between the}} degree of sintering and both mixture composition and treatment conditions to be singled out. Mineralogical analyses detected the presence of neo-formation minerals from the pyroxene group. Estimation of the extent of metal loss from the samples indicated that the potential for volatilization of species of Pb, Cd and Zn is still a matter of major concern when dealing with <b>thermal</b> treatment of <b>incinerator</b> ash...|$|R
40|$|It is only {{reasonable}} {{to become a}} zero waste society and for producers to immediately start redesigning products, and {{for us to make}} the transition in our mentality to stop buying products that we do not really need or products that we could, in fact, borrow. In the interim (transitional period), until all our products are sustainable ones, waste <b>incinerators</b> (<b>thermal</b> treatment that utilises energy recovery) will still be unavoidable. However, {{this does not mean that}} new ones will need to be built, instead, the existing infrastructure can be utilised. Thermal treatment should only be allowed to be used for waste that cannot be utilised or returned into the material flow in any way. In my master’s thesis I have presented an overview of municipal waste management: the history and current situation in both Slovenia and Europe. I carried out a study on Zero Waste and the standard of municipal waste services. I have presented the techniques of treating mixed municipal waste, a circular economy, material flows of certain types of waste, the 5 or 6 steps of waste management, as well as the Zero Waste movement and how to join this movement. The ‘Loči. me’ (‘separate me’) application was developed to promote the correct sorting of waste and encourage people to separate their waste. On the basis of the facts examined, I put forward some proposals on how to harmonise the operations of municipal companies, critically determine the current roles and perspectives of modern methods of waste thermal treatment and an initiative to adopt a circular economy as a systemic solution for the formation of a zero waste society...|$|R
