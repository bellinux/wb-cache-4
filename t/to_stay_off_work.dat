In contrast to Damon's hot-headed recklessness, Barry was calm and responsible and made amends with the Collins after Damon vandalised their house. Barry was hard-working and smart in contrast to Damon. After Barry was stabbed in December 1982 the doctor told him <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>off</b> <b>work,</b> however shortly after Bobby was out-on-strike and the Grants struggled to pay their mortgage.

5000|$|In April 1984, a small {{majority}} of NACODS voted to strike {{in support of}} the NUM, but this fell short of the two-thirds majority that their constitution required for a national strike. [...] The National Coal Board had decided in the 1972 strike that a NACODS member was entitled <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>off</b> <b>work</b> without any loss of pay if he faced violence or aggressive intimidation from NUM pickets. [...] When the number of NUM strikebreakers increased in August, Merrick Spanton, the NCB personnel director, stated that he expected NACODS members to cross the picket lines to supervise their work. [...] As this would have meant crossing aggressive (and sometimes violent) lines, it brought another ballot for a national strike from NACODS. [...] For {{the first time in their}} history, NACODS voted to strike in September 1984 by a vote of 81%. [...] However, a deal negotiated by North Yorkshire NCB Director Michael Eaton persuaded NACODS to call off the strike action in return to changes to the review procedures for threatened collieries. [...] Ian MacGregor later admitted that if NACODS had gone ahead with a strike, a compromise would probably have been forced on the Coal Board. Files later made public showed that the Government had an informant inside the TUC, passing information about negotiations.|$|E

SUBJECTS: Working adults with a new or worsening cough or clinical presentation suggestive of LRTI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Issuing sickness certificates and advising patients <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>off</b> <b>work.</b> RESULTS: GPs recorded similar symptoms and signs in patients in the two countries. Antibiotics were prescribed more often in Polish than in Norwegian patients (70. 4 % vs. 27. 1 %, p < 0. 0001). About half of the patients received a formal sickness certificate (50. 5 % in Norway and 52. 0 % in Poland). The proportion of patients advised <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>off</b> <b>work</b> was significantly higher in the Polish sample compared with the Norwegian sample (75. 2 % vs. 56. 1 %, p = 0. 002). Norwegian GPs less often issued sick certificates {{for more than seven}} days (5. 6 % vs. 36. 9 %, p < 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: The overall proportion of sickness certification for acute cough/LRTI was similar in Norwegian and Polish patients. However, in the Polish sample, GPs more often advised patients to take time off work without issuing a sick note. When sickness certificates were issued, duration of longer than seven days was more common in Polish than in Norwegian patients...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Based on the World Health Organization’s global {{school health}} {{initiative}} we investigate intervention effects of statewide health promotion in schools {{on the numbers}} of children’s sick days and visits to a physician, and parental days off work due to child illness. Methods Cluster-randomized trial with 1 -year follow-up in primary schools {{in the state of}} Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Anthropometric measurements of first and second grade school children were taken by trained staff. Parents filled in questionnaires for information about socio-demographics, health-related variables, numbers of children’s sick days, visits to a physician, and days parents had <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>off</b> <b>work</b> to care for a sick child. Longitudinal differences in the outcome variables were calculated between baseline and follow-up. Intraclass correlation coefficients were determined to quantify a possible clustering of data in schools. Accordingly, linear models and linear mixed models were applied to identify relationships and ascertain significances. Results Data from 1943 children (1 st grade n[*]=[*] 1024, 6. 6 [*]±[*] 0. 4  years old; 2 nd grade n[*]=[*] 919, 7. 6 [*]±[*] 0. 4  years old) were available at baseline. Unadjusted differences regarding both grades were found between mean longitudinal changes in intervention and control group in children’s sick days (− 3. 2 [*]±[*] 7. 1 vs. - 2. 3 [*]±[*] 5. 6, p[*]=[*] 0. 013), and maternal days off work (− 0. 9 [*]±[*] 2. 4 vs. - 0. 5 [*]±[*] 2. 8, p[*]=[*] 0. 019). The intervention effect on sick days was adjusted in a linear regression for baseline values, gender and migration background and confirmed for first grade children (B[*]=[*]− 0. 83, p[*]=[*] 0. 003). The intervention effect on maternal days off work lost its significance after adjusting for baseline values. No significant differences were detected in the numbers of children’s visits to a physician and paternal days off work. Conclusions School-based health promotion slightly reduces sick days in first grade children. Subsequently, parents may not need <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>off</b> <b>work</b> themselves. Small individual effects add up to larger benefits in a statewide implementation of health promotion. Additionally, health promotion may also positively contribute to school success.

The QR technology method is applied in this project for performing an easy way to check the verification of a medical certificate. The method that have been used is for encode the information data to protect the data from being forge. Thus, the end user can verify the medical certificate using any device with QR reader application to decode the data and get the real information from it...|$|E

All 60 participants replied to both questionnaires. The elite runner is training between 90 - 150 km per week, using one daily training session. He is generally careful about stretching and warming up and down. Forty-three per cent of runners sustained injuries in the last year that prevented them from training, but only 3 % needed <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>off</b> <b>work.</b> The most common reasons for not completing the race were exhaustion and injuries to the lower extremities. Sixty-one per cent of the runners who did not drink at all refreshment stations dropped out, whereas only 27 % of those who did dropped out. There was no difference in relation to results or medical problems between the group who used a special diet before the run and those who did not.

40|$|Information on {{prognostic}} {{factors for}} duration of sick leave due to low-back pain (LBP) is growing. In this prospective cohort study prognostic factors for duration of sick leave and course of disability {{were identified in}} a very early stage of sick leave due to LBP in an occupational health care setting. A total of 615 workers calling in sick from work due to LBP at an occupational health service (OHS) of one institution completed a questionnaire. Duration of follow-up was 26 weeks. Prognostic factors were identified by means of Cox regression analysis and multiple linear regression analysis, and explained variance was calculated. Median time to first return to work (RTW) was 5 days (Inter Quartile Range (IQR) = 2 - 12). Median time to lasting return to work (LRTW) was 6 days (IQR = 3 - 13). The final model for delayed RTW included self-reported expected duration of sick-leave, treatment by GP or specialist, care-seeking, diminished mobility, and the interaction between care-seeking and diminished mobility. The final model for LRTW included: self-reported expected duration of sick-leave, treatment by GP or specialist, care-seeking, {{the interaction between the}} self-reported expected duration of sick-leave and seeking care at OHS, complaints due to job stress, diminished mobility, and the interactions between expected duration of more then 10 days and seeking OP care and diminished mobility. Median total days on sick leave (TDSL) was 6 days (IQR = 3 - 13 days). The final model for TDSL included: age, expected duration of sick leave, treatment by GP or medical specialist, seeking OP care, complaints due to physical load, and diminished mobility. Explained variance (R 2) of these models ranged from 30 to 35 %. Poor prognosis for duration of sick leave can be identified by means of a simple questionnaire administered {{on the first day of}} sick leave. Workers at high risk for longer duration of sick leave (all outcomes) expected <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>off</b> <b>work</b> longer, were already being treated by a MD, sought OP care, and had diminished mobility. In case of delayed LRTW workers reported job stress as a possible cause of sick leave. Interactions were found in both RTW and LRTW between care-seeking and diminished mobility and in LRTW between expected duration of sick leave and seeking OP care. Older age increased TDSL with borderline significanc...|$|E
