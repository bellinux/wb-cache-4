A sequential multi source evaporation process has been employed. Deposition of an In Ga S precursor layer {{was followed by the}} diffusion of Cu and S into the precursor layer. The depth profiles of <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> <b>O</b> and C, and constituent elements In and Ga were investigated by secondary ion mass spectroscopy SIMS. Coevaporated films were measured for comparison and the concentrations of O, C, In, and Ga were almost constant throughout the film. In case of our sequential process, a higher Ga concentration inside the Cu In,Ga S 2 layer and a lower one towards the surface has been confirmed. X ray diffraction XRD data also confirm the existence of two Cu In,Ga S 2 layers with different Ga content. It has been found that the O concentration was constant in the bulk and maximum at the interface between Ga rich bottom layers and In rich surface layers with a decreased concentration next to the surface. On the other hand, C was also nearly constant in the bulk, but tended to increase in a layer close to the surface. A model of the incorporation of impurities will be proposed. The changes of concentrations of O, C, In, and Ga become less pronounced with increasing S pressure. This indicates that higher S partial pressure may promote the diffusion of the constituent elements and impurities in the film. A solar cell made from one of our Cu In,Ga S 2 films showed an efficiency of 9. 3 total area, no antireflection coating, effective band gapg 1. 52 e...|$|E

This testing program has been executed as part of {{the second phase of the}} CO 2 PIPETRANS Joint Industry Project (JIP). The objective of the corrosion work package was to determine the mechanism and corrosion rate in dense phase CO 2 for various impurities including O 2, SOx, NOx, and H 2 S with and without free water. The experimental work was carried out using a specialised rotating autoclave for carrying out CO 2 corrosion experiments, which gives a good mixing and disturbed flow around the test specimen. The test specimens used in the set-up were selected grades of carbon steel and stainless steel, typically used as pipeline materials. The experiments were carried out at two different temperatures, that is 4 °C and 50 °C, at a pressure of approximately 100 bar. Different combinations and concentrations of <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> <b>O</b> 2, SO 2, H 2 S, NO, NO 2 were added to the pure CO 2 with water concentrations of 50 and 500 ppmv. Published quality recommendations from the DYNAMIS were used as a starting point to decide the concentrations of the impurities to be tested. After the corrosion testing the metal loss was determined and the corrosion rates were calculated. The effect of the impurities on the solubility limits of water, which results in increased corrosion rates, are presented. Further, how to use the results in order to define a safe operating window for dense phase CO 2 containing various impurities is discussed. Based on the experimental results, there are still uncertainties related to water solubility and the corrosion mechanisms in the presence of impurities. Further work is required to narrow the uncertainty, however, the uncertainty can be overcome with an appropriate design philosophy. The results are a step in the refinement of the operational limits for different impurities found in pipelines carrying anthropogenic CO 2 and the moisture content. The results serves as input for updating DNV-RP-J 202 “Design and Operation of CO 2 pipelines” [1] to provide improved guidance on safe and reliable design, construction and operation of pipelines intended for large scale transportation of CO 2. Increased understanding of corrosion mechanisms furthermore leads to more cost effective pipeline design and design of CO 2 conditioning processes...|$|E

O atom prefers to occupy the octahedral interstitial site with the solution energy of − 4. 942  eV. Along the [100] direction, the ideal tensile strength of vanadium doped with an O occupying the octahedral interstitial site is 17. 4  GPa, which can be reduced by ∼ 8. 9 % compared to 19. 1  GPa of pure vanadium. This demonstrates that <b>impurity</b> <b>O</b> has a large effect on the tensile strength of vanadium. We further calculate the generalized fault energies including the unstable stacking energy (γus) and the cleavage energy (γcl) in pure vanadium and O-vanadium system in the most preferable { 110 } slip system.

40|$|We {{study the}} zero-bandwidth {{limit of the}} two-impurity Anderson model in an antiferromagnetic (AF) metal. We calculate, for {{different}} values of the model parameters, the lowest excitation energy, the magnetic correlation $ $ between <b>the</b> <b>impurities,</b> and <b>the</b> magnetic moment at each impurity site, {{as a function of}} the distance between <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> and <b>the</b> temperature. At zero temperature, in the region of parameters corresponding to the Kondo regime of <b>the</b> <b>impurities,</b> we observe an interesting competition between the AF gap and the Kondo physics of <b>the</b> two <b>impurities.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> are close enough, the AF splitting governs the physics of the system and the local moments of <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> are frozen, in a state with very strong ferromagnetic correlation between <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> and roughly independent of the distance. On the contrary, when <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> are sufficiently far apart and the AF gap is not too large, the scenario of the Kondo physics take place: non-magnetic ground state and the possibility of spin-flip excitation emerges and the ferromagnetic $ $ decreases as the distance increases, but the complete decoupling of <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> never occurs. In adition, the presence of the AF gap gives a non-zero magnetic moment at each impurity site, showing a non complete Kondo screening of <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> in <b>the</b> system. We observe that the residual magnetic moment decreases when the distance between <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> is increased.

40|$|The {{recrystallization}} of amorphous GexSi 1 -x {{thin films}} on Si with uniform and with increasing Ge content is studied. The amorphous-crystal interface roughness is modified {{by the presence}} of C and <b>O</b> <b>impurities</b> before entering <b>the</b> GexSi 1 -x layer. The crystallization kinetics are heavily affected by the resulting interface morphology. A minimum velocity is found in the region of <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> where <b>the</b> interface starts to roughen; the strain effect induced by the Ge within the GexSi 1 -x is overcome and the crystallization proceeds according to kinetics very similar to those for pure Si...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a finite, disordered 1 D quantum lattice with a side-attached impurity. We study theoretically {{the transport of}} a single electron from <b>the</b> <b>impurity</b> into <b>the</b> lattice, at zero temperature. The transport is dominated by Anderson localization and, in general, the electron motion has a random character due to the lattice disorder. However, we show that by adjusting <b>the</b> <b>impurity</b> energy <b>the</b> electron can attain quasi-periodic motions, oscillating between <b>the</b> <b>impurity</b> and a small region of the lattice. This region corresponds {{to the center of}} a localized state in the lattice with an energy matched by that of <b>the</b> <b>impurity.</b> By precisely tuning <b>the</b> <b>impurity</b> energy, <b>the</b> electron can be set to oscillate between <b>the</b> <b>impurity</b> and a region far from <b>the</b> <b>impurity,</b> even distances larger than the Anderson localization length. The electron oscillations result from the interference of hybridized states, which have some resemblance to Pendry's necklace states [J. B. Pendry, J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys. 20, 733 - 742 (1987) ]. The dependence of the electron motion on <b>the</b> <b>impurity</b> energy gives a potential mechanism for selectively routing an electron towards different regions of a 1 D disordered lattice...|$|R
