5|$|When GHQ {{moved up}} to Brisbane, LHQ {{remained}} behind in Melbourne, but Blamey formed an Advanced LHQ under his Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS), Major General George Alan Vasey, which moved to nearby St Lucia. Major General Frank Berryman replaced Vasey as DCGS in September 1942, and remained in the post until January 1944. He resumed the post in July 1944 and remained until December 1945. When <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> GHQ moved to Hollandia, Advanced LHQ followed, opening there on 15 December, but when the main GHQ moved to Leyte in February 1945, Advanced LHQ remained behind. A Forward Echelon LHQ was formed under Berryman that remained co-located with <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> GHQ, while <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> LHQ remained at Hollandia until it moved to Morotai for the operations in Borneo in April 1945.|$|E

5|$|Charles himself took a main column {{along the}} high road, a {{causeway}} that passed by Saulgau, to attack Lefebvre on points between Hoßkirch and Ostrach.

5|$|Galileo {{continued}} to receive visitors until 1642, when, after suffering fever and heart palpitations, {{he died on}} 8 January 1642, aged 77.

5|$|He was wrong; the Austrians {{engaged with}} the French advance guard {{numbered}} closer to 50,000, and constituted <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> Charles' army, not its advance guard.

5|$|In the {{periodic}} table published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the table, {{at the end of}} each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals. This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871, which contained the modern carbon group (group 14), titanium group (group 4), cerium, and thorium, because their maximum oxidation state was +4. Cerium was soon removed from <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the table and placed in a separate lanthanide series; thorium was left with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as titanium and zirconium.|$|E

5|$|Temnospondyls' {{vertebrae}} {{are divided}} into several segments. In living tetrapods, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the vertebra is {{a single piece of}} bone called the centrum, but in temnospondyls, this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum. Two types of vertebrae are recognized in temnospondyls: stereospondylous and rhachitomous vertebrae.'In rhachitomous vertebrae, the intercentra are large and wedge-shaped, and the pleurocentra are relatively small blocks that fit between them.' Both elements support a spine-like neural arch, and well-developed interlocking projections called zygapophyses strengthen the connections between vertebrae. The strong backbone and strong limbs of many ratchitomous temnospondyls allowed them to be partially, and in some cases fully, terrestrial. In stereospondylous vertebrae, the pleurocentra have been lost entirely, with the intercentra enlarged as <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the vertebrae. This weaker type of backbone indicates that stereospondylous temnospondyls spent more time in water.|$|E
