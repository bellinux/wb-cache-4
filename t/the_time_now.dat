It fell precipitously by 84% on its second Friday and by 72% during its second weekend overall, grossing $47.4million, {{which is the largest}} second-weekend drop for any film that opened to more than $90million. Still, it managed to become the fastest-grossing film in the franchise and also achieved the second-largest ten-day gross ever at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> (<b>now</b> eighth).

5|$|Wilcke {{was born}} on 11 March 1913 at Schrimm in the Province of Posen, part of the Kingdom of Prussia at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>now</b> Śrem in the Greater Poland Voivodeship, Poland. He {{was the son of}} a Hauptmann (captain) of Infanterie-Regiment 47 (47th Infantry Regiment), Hans Wilcke, who died of {{pneumonia}} when Wilcke was just four weeks of age. His mother, Hertha von Schuckmann, married again on 14 June 1919. In 1931, Wilcke was arrested for attending a then-illegal demonstration of the Nazi Party. Although his loyalty to the Nazi cause is emphasized multiple times in his personal military files, according to biographers Prien and Stemmer, he was a firm opponent of the National Socialist regime; later in his career, for a time after taking command of III. Gruppe (3rd group) of Jagdgeschwader 53 (JG 53—53rd Fighter Wing), he had the Swastikas on his unit's aircraft painted over. He volunteered for military service in the Reichswehr after receiving his Abitur (diploma). He joined Artillerie-Regiment 6 (6th Artillery Regiment) in Minden as a Fahnenjunker (officer cadet) on 1 April 1934. His legal guardian and stepfather, Friedrich von Scotti, also served in this regiment.|$|E
5|$|With <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>now</b> 3:25a.m., {{the delegates}} took an {{informal}} ballot. Weaver led the pack with about 30% of the votes, with Wright, Dillaye, and Butler trailing at about 15% each {{and the remaining}} votes scattered among the remaining candidates. Supporters of Wright and Butler talked of combining their forces, but the momentum favored Weaver. In the first formal ballot, at 4:10a.m., Weaver gained votes, and delegates began shifting their ballots to him. Without any official motion, the nomination was made unanimous, and the brass band again began to play. Weaver, who was staying at the nearby Palmer House hotel, was summoned to the convention. As they waited, the delegates turned to the vice presidential nomination. Some of Butler's supporters proposed nominating Absolom M. West of Mississippi, a more conservative Greenbacker, to balance the ticket against Weaver, whom they regarded as radical. West, who {{was present at the}} convention, had already disappointed the radicals by opposing women's suffrage and the eight-hour day. They instead proposed Barzillai J. Chambers of Texas, who had been the Union Greenbackers' nominee for vice president. The majority agreed, as Chambers took 403 votes to West's 311.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} day of the trial, Winthrop recorded, [...] "Mrs. Hutchinson, the court you see hath labored to bring you to {{acknowledge}} the error of your way that so you might be reduced. <b>The</b> <b>time</b> <b>now</b> grows late. We shall therefore give you a little more time to consider of it and therefore desire that you attend the court again in the morning." [...] The first day had gone fairly well for Hutchinson, who had held her own in a battle of wits with the magistrates. Biographer Eve LaPlante suggests, [...] "Her success before the court may have astonished her judges, but it was no surprise to her. [...] She was confident of herself and her intellectual tools, largely because of the intimacy she felt with God." ...|$|E
500|$|Her {{departure}} from the guitar-driven rock of her previous works stemmed from the feeling that it was outdated, arguing that [...] "as soon as any form becomes traditional, like the guitar, bass and drums, then people start to behave traditionally," [...] and that [...] "it's really {{difficult to get a}} band to stay on the edge using typical bass, guitar and drums set-up because it tends to lapse into a predictable form." [...] Being a fan of dance music {{since the early days of}} acid house, she thus used it as the framework for her songs. However, in a Rolling Stone interview she also stated that [...] " [...] was more influenced by ambient music than what you'd call dance music, and by things that were happening way back in Chicago and Detroit that were sensual and daring and groundbreaking in their time;" [...] also adding: [...] "Ninety-five percent of the dance music you hear today is crap. It's only that experimental five percent that I'm into—the records that get played in clubs after 7 o'clock in the morning, when the DJs are playing stuff for themselves, rather than trying to please people." [...] Björk's embracement of England's dance culture also extended to her looks, with her style at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>now</b> considered a representative of 1990s acid house fashion.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} [...] "Compass Point", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a {{reference}} to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was [...] "Back to Earth", {{and was the first}} song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, [...] "There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so we went back to that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it’s just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it’ll be done.' That of course was not the case, and we ended basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves." [...] Frankel called the EP's closer, [...] "Footsteps", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was [...] "Your Favorite Band/Footsteps". As Frankel described coming up with the name, [...] "I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. When I was there, I overheard some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they’re DJing,' and that’s something that happens all <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>now.</b> People go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it’s a DJ set. I thought it was kind of funny, and also kind of sad — but in a funny way." [...] While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; [...] "We’re still messing around, because {{we have a lot of}} demos from this last year and a half, and we’re sifting through, figuring out if there’s one more we want to finish." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) is a long-focal-length imager {{designed}} for high resolution and responsivity at visible wavelengths. The instrument {{is equipped with}} a 1024×1024 pixel by 12-bits-per-pixel monochromatic CCD imager with a [...] aperture giving a resolution of 5μrad (~1arcsec).

This temperature differential requires insulation, and isolation {{from the rest of the}} structure. The Ritchey–Chretien mirrors and metering structure are made of silicon carbide, to boost stiffness, reduce weight, and prevent warping at low temperatures.
