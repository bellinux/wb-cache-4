5|$|By 1914, {{experiments}} by physicists Ernest Rutherford, Henry Moseley, James Franck and Gustav Hertz {{had largely}} established {{the structure of}} an atom as a dense nucleus of positive charge surrounded by lower-mass electrons. In 1913, Danish physicist Niels Bohr postulated that electrons resided in quantized energy states, with their energies determined by the angular momentum of the electron's orbit about the nucleus. The electrons could move between those states, or orbits, by the emission or absorption of photons of specific frequencies. By means of these quantized orbits, he accurately explained the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom. However, Bohr's model failed <b>to</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> relative intensities of the spectral lines and it was unsuccessful in explaining the spectra of more complex atoms.|$|E

A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized <b>to</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied.
