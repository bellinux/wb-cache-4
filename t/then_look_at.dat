It's a bit like those old Reformed Protestants. The Reformed lie all the time. And why is that? Because they have standards and values that are so high that you can't humanly maintain them. You also see that in that Muslim culture. <b>Then</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the Netherlands. In what country could an electoral leader of such a large movement as mine be openly homosexual? How wonderful that that's possible. That's something that one can be proud of. And I'd like {{to keep it that}} way, thank you very much.|$|E
500|$|Shepard was {{designated}} Chief of the Astronaut Office in November 1963. He thereby became responsible for NASA [...] astronaut training. This involved {{the development of}} appropriate training programs for all astronauts and the scheduling of training of individual astronauts for specific missions and roles. He provided and coordinated astronaut input into mission planning and the design of spacecraft and other equipment {{to be used by}} astronauts on space missions. He also was on the selection panel for the NASA Astronaut Group 5 in 1966. He spent much of his time investing in banks, wildcatting, and real estate. He became part owner and vice president of Baytown National Bank and would spend hours on the phone in his NASA office overseeing it. He also bought a partnership in a ranch in Weatherford, Texas, that raised horses and cattle. During this period, his secretary had several head shot photographs taken of Shepard, posed with various expressions on his face. She would post these on the door to his private office, with a sign which said [...] "Mood of the Day". Visitors could <b>then</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the photo to decide whether it was a good time to talk to him. Tom Wolfe characterised Shepard's dual personalities as [...] "Smilin' Al" [...] and the [...] "Icy Commander". [...] "Inside his locker", Wolfe wrote, [...] "he kept Smilin' Al of the Cape!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{group is}} first pictured sitting around {{backstage}} while waiting {{to have their}} hair and make-up done. In another scene, Little Mix are filmed on their tour bus. This scene features Jade Thirlwall scribbling in a notebook as the other group members play around, laugh and take pictures of each other sleeping using the Samsung Galaxy. The group <b>then</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the pictures they took together. In a different scene, Perrie Edwards is seen cuddling a puppy. Little Mix are also pictured singing [...] "Change Your Life" [...] {{to each other in}} a studio and preparing to go on stage at their Rhyl Pavilion tour date. Other scenes features the group in a dance rehearsal, using funny facial expressions and bonding with their mothers backstage. During the dance rehearsal, the group is seen practising dance moves to their DNA Tour setlist with their tour choreographer and backing dancers. In other scenes, the group is seen playing with their own Little Mix dolls and Thirlwall, sporting blue hair, is wheeled away in a cardboard box. Before going onstage, Leigh-Anne Pinnock is seen smiling as a make-up artist applies her final touches while Thirlwall is pictured applying her own make-up. The group then centre themselves as they show each other support by hugging one another before heading to the stage. After the show, the foursome is seen showing their solidarity by embracing one another again.|$|E

Film can be so much more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{entering}} college, Robinson held {{a short-term}} job as shoeshine man before {{getting a job}} as warehouse personnel. [...] After finishing his college degree, Robinson {{was unable to find}} a suitable career in his hometown of Gulfport. Robinson attributed this to racial discrimination as many of the local garages were under white ownership; speaking to his father, he said, [...] " [...] give me a job sweeping, filling gas tanks, changing tires, or washing, but I'm an engine man... When I talk to [...] about automotive science they smile, look at each other, and <b>then</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me like I belong behind a mule and a plow." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 22 November, Erdoğan {{said that}} Assad should {{learn from the}} fate of Muammar Gaddafi. Erdogan said that [...] "Assad is showing up and saying he would fight to the death. For God's Sake, against whom will you fight? Fighting against your own people is not heroism, but cowardice. If {{you want to see}} someone who has fought until death against his own people, just look at Nazi Germany, just look at Hitler, at Benito Mussolini, at Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania," [...] and [...] "If you cannot draw any lessons from them, <b>then</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the Libyan leader who was killed just 32 days ago in a manner none of us would wish for and who used the same {{expression}} you used." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "random cutups" [...] {{from the}} Adler story {{that are part}} of the album's lyrics and liner notes were written by Bowie, who typed them into his Mac {{computer}} and then ran a custom program called the Verbasizer. The Verbasizer was a program written by Gracenote co-founder Ty Roberts, the program would cut up and reassemble Bowie's words electronically, much like he had done with paper, scissors and glue back in the 1970s. He would <b>then</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the lyrics while the band played a song and decide [...] "whether I was going to sing, do a dialogue, or become a character. I would improvise with the band, really fast on my feet, getting from one line to another and seeing what worked." [...] Bowie claimed that it took about three and a half hours using this method to create [...] "virtually the entire genesis" [...] of the album Outside.|$|E
2500|$|Hudson and Leidl <b>then</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{the foreign}} policy of the Barack Obama {{administration}} and Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State to see whether their actions reflected commitment to the Hillary Doctrine. In many cases, they found that it did, such as appointing many women to positions of power, increasing funding for the Office of Global Women's Issues {{by a factor of}} ten, heavy use of social media, and Clinton's local visits to women's groups. Indeed, Clinton made the empowerment of women worldwide the signature issue of her time as Secretary of State. But they also note a number of occasions where Clinton and the administration were silent about abuses of women or girls due to strategic needs of the U.S., most of all in the [...] "conspicuous silence" [...] about Saudi Arabia's treatment of its female population. Finally, they look at implementation, and find that during the period in question much was done to implement the Hillary Doctrine in Washington by means of setting up a regulatory and legal framework for it, but that there was a more mixed record past that point, with omissions and weaknesses occurring in the program development, contracting, and local implementation phases.|$|E

2500|$|MacMillan was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant into the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in August 1915. Due to him not being 19, he was posted to the 3rd Battalion, Argylls, a training unit, stationed near Edinburgh. In April 1916 {{he was sent to}} the Western Front where he joined the 2nd Battalion (the 93rd), a Regular Army unit which was then serving as part of the 98th Brigade of the 33rd Division, in Northeast France, and immediately became involved in fierce trench warfare at Brickstacks. This was followed by engagements, as part of the battles of the Somme and Passchendaele, at Cuinchy, Bazentin-le-Petit, High Wood, Mametz Wood, Arras, Le Cateau and the Selle. While still only 19 years old and a second lieutenant, he was appointed acting adjutant of the battalion in November 1916. He was promoted to lieutenant in April 1917, and formally confirmed as Adjutant in June. He remained in this post {{for the rest of the}} war, serving seven different commanding officers (CO). The casualties were immense and, at one time, while a second lieutenant, he found himself by default commanding the battalion. MacMillan wrote [...] "I would say that I was fortunate to belong to the best battalion in the Army, with an unbreakable spirit. You can see this from the record of their operations – and <b>then</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the casualty list: 63 officers and 1175 men killed, and ready for anything at the end of it all".|$|E
2500|$|Q. D. Leavis said of Crabbe: [...] "He is (or {{ought to}} be—for who reads him?) a living classic." [...] His classic status was also {{supported}} by T. S. Eliot {{in an essay}} on the poetry of Samuel Johnson in which Eliot grouped Crabbe together favorably with Johnson, Pope, and several other poets. Eliot said that [...] "to have the virtues of good prose is the first and minimum requirement of good poetry." [...] Critic Arthur Pollard believes that Crabbe definitely met this qualification. Critic William Caldwell Roscoe, answering William Hazlitt's question of why Crabbe hadn't in fact written prose rather than verse said [...] "have you ever read Crabbe's prose? Look at his letters, especially the later ones, look at the correct but lifeless expression of his dedications and prefaces — <b>then</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his verse, {{and you will see}} how much he has exceeded 'the minimum requirement of good poetry'." [...] Critic F. L. Lucas summed up Crabbe's qualities: [...] "naïve, yet shrewd; straightforward, yet sardonic; blunt, yet tender; quiet, yet passionate; realistic, yet romantic." [...] Crabbe, who is seen as a complicated poet, has been and often still is dismissed as too narrow in his interests and in his way of responding to them in his poetry. [...] "At {{the same time as the}} critic is making such judgments, he is all too often aware that Crabbe, nonetheless, defies classification," [...] says Pollard.|$|E
