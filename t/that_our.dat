5|$|Genetic {{evidence}} suggests <b>that</b> <b>our</b> human ancestors acquired pubic lice from gorillas approximately 3-4 million years ago. Unlike the genus Pediculus, the divergence in Phthirus {{does not match}} the age of host divergence that likely occurred 7 million years ago. Reed et al. propose a Phthirus species host-switch around 3-4 million years ago. While {{it is difficult to}} determine if a parasite-host switch occurred in evolutionary history, this explanation is the most parsimonious (containing the fewest evolutionary changes).|$|E
5|$|I've had to {{deal with}} some hard truths... People don't like to hear we've got only 18 percent of the electorate.

5|$|Some {{fans have}} {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>our</b> new Enterprise should carry a plaque somewhere which commemorates {{the fact it}} was named after the first space shuttle launched from Earth in 1970s.

5|$|The {{young men}} and women of Hazelwood East {{expected}} a civics lesson, but not the one the Court teaches them today...Such unthinking contempt for individual rights is intolerable from any state official.

25|$|Turkle's main {{argument}} {{in the first part}} of the book is <b>that</b> <b>our</b> interactions with robots that simulate emotion pose serious threats to our ability to relate to one another properly. Turkle discusses robots that have been designed to interact with humans on an emotional level; she fears that they may then replace other humans and animals in these emotional roles. Turkle is concerned that we often attribute certain qualities to robots that the robots do not in fact possess, and <b>that</b> <b>our</b> emotional interactions with other humans become eroded as a direct result. Turkle's concern is <b>that</b> <b>our</b> appreciation for human interaction may become eroded.|$|E
