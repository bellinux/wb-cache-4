Before the war, peoples of Japanese ancestry were a small but valuable element in our population. Their record of law-abiding, industrious citizenship was surpassed by no other group.

Then war came with the nation of their parental origin, The ensuing {{two and a half years}} have brought heartaches to many in our population. Among the casualties of war has been America’s Japanese minority. It is my hope that the wounds which it has received in the great uprooting will heal.

40|$|THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON DAILY POINTS OF LIGHT The President recognizes a "Daily Point of Light" {{six days}} a week Daily Points of Light are those who {{successfully}} address our most pressing social problems through direct and consequential acts of community service. Individuals, families, businesses, groups, and organizations of every conceivable type are ta king success­ful action to combat drug abuse, illiteracy, inadequate education, environmental decay, homelessness, hunger, AIDS, and other critical ills. By reclaiming a drug-plagued, crime-ridden neighborhood, tutoring those who are illiterate, mentoring a troubled young person, befriending a lonely senior dtizen, providing hOUSing for the homeless, or protecting our environment, Americans have enriched their communities and, in doing so, have brought meaning and ful­fillment to their own lives. Daily Points of Light recognition is intended not only to honor those who are making a difference in thelives of those in need, but more importantly to urge every individual, family, business, union, school, place of worship, club, group, and other institution in America to make serving others central to their life and work. As <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> <b>said,</b> "Ifyou have a hammer, fmd a nail. Ifyouknow how to read, find someone who can't. If you're not in trouble, seek out someone who is [...] . " "The growth and magnification of Points of Light must now become an American mission [...] . it is increasingly clear to more and more Alnericans that our greatest social problems -drugs, education refonn, the environment, crime -will be sol ved only by the active engagement of tens of millions of individ uals and millions of groups and institutions who have never been involved before in these problems and who will never be compensated one nickel for their work. " Points of Light demonstrate that problems in America can be solved. The PresIdent believes that every American wants to be a Point of Light to those in need, if only they are shown how they can make a difference. We therefore strongly encourage not onIy every newspaper, magazine, television and radio station, but also every other business, group, and other institution in America, to communicate in their own way the story of Daily Points of Light to the entire Nation. ...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] Safety in {{the coal}} mining {{industry}} is much improved compared to {{the early decades of}} the twentieth century, a time when hundreds of miners could lose their lives in a single accident and more than 1, 000 fatalities could occur in a single year. Fatal injuries associated with coal mine accidents fell almost continually between 1925 and 2005, when they reached an all-time low of 23. As a result of 12 deaths at West Virginia’s Sago mine and fatalities at other coal mines in 2006, however, the number of fatalities more than doubled to 47. Fatalities declined a year later to 33, which is comparable to levels achieved during the late 1990 s. In addition to the well above-average fatal injury rates they face, coal miners suffer from occupationally caused diseases. Prime among them is black lung (coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, CWP), which still claims about 1, 000 fatalities annually. Although improved dust control requirements have led to a decrease in the prevalence of CWP, there is recent evidence of advanced cases among miners who began their careers after the stronger standards went into effect in the early 1970 s. In addition, disagreement persists over the current respirable dust limits and the degree of compliance with them by mine operators. In the wake of the January 2006 Sago mine accident, the U. S. Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) was criticized for its slow pace of rulemaking earlier in the decade. MSHA standard-setting activity quickened starting later that year, however, after enactment in June of the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act (MINER, P. L. 109 - 236). The MINER act, the first major amendment to federal mine safety law since 1977, emphasized factors thought to have played a role in the Sago disaster (e. g., emergency oxygen supplies, post-accident communication and tracking systems, deployment of rescue teams) and imposed several rulemaking deadlines on MSHA. Accordingly, the agency published final regulations on emergency mine evacuation in December 2006, civil penalties in March 2007, and rescue teams as well as asbestos exposure in February 2008. Some policymakers remain dissatisfied with MSHA’s performance. These sentiments most recently led to House passage, in January 2008, of the Supplemental Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act (S-MINER, H. R. 2768). It incorporates language from the Miner Health Enhancement Act (H. R. 2769), such as requiring MSHA to adopt as mandatory exposure limits the voluntary limits (to chemical hazards, for example) recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. S-MINER also requires MSHA to more closely review and monitor operator plans that include retreat mining, the practice used at Utah’s Crandall Canyon mine where six miners and three rescuers lost their lives in 2007. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> he will veto S-MINER as passed by the House. In light of rulemaking activity required this year by the MINER act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (P. L. 110 - 161), MSHA asked the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for assistance. Congress increased MSHA’s appropriation between FY 2007 ($ 302 million) and FY 2008 ($ 334 million). The Administration’s FY 2009 budget request for MSHA is $ 332 million...|$|E
