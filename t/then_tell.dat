5|$|The {{margin of}} the Empress Eudocia's copy of the Iliad has a note {{summarizing}} a Hellenistic poet who tells a different story of Orion's birth. Here the gods Zeus, Hermes, and Poseidon come to visit Hyrieus of Tanagra, who roasts a whole bull for them. When they offer him a favor, he asks {{for the birth of}} sons. The gods take the bull's hide and ejaculate or urinate into it and bury it in the earth, <b>then</b> <b>tell</b> him to dig it up ten months later. When he does, he finds Orion; this explains why Orion is earthborn.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} script {{called for}} Michael to tell Andy about Angela's affair {{outside in the}} parking lot before getting into his car and driving away. When filming began, Holland considered filming the scene inside the car instead. Steve Carell suggested Michael get in the car and leave Andy outside, <b>then</b> <b>tell</b> him while driving away, which was how the scene was ultimately shot. During a scene when Andy returns to the office and confronts his co-workers; there is a long, awkward silence, and the script originally called for Kevin to pass gas and ruin the tension. During filming, it was changed so Phyllis would pass gas instead because it was decided it would be funnier if it were a woman. During the editing process, Holland decided the joke did not work very well and cut it, but a brief moment of Dwight reacting in a disgusted way to the flatulence, while maintaining a defensive fighting pose toward Andy, can still be seen in the finished episode.|$|E

500|$|The President's friend, Dr. William Sturgis Bigelow, {{had been}} in Japan for most of 1907; on his return to his Boston home he heard about the Saint-Gaudens coinage from Senator Henry Cabot Lodge. [...] Bigelow {{was one of a}} number of Roosevelt's friends given early {{specimens}} of the double eagle. [...] He wrote to the President on January 8, 1908, praising the Saint-Gaudens coins and stating that he was working with a Boston sculptor, Bela Pratt, on an idea that would allow coins to be struck in high relief. [...] Pieces struck in this manner would have the designs protected from wear and be able to stack easily (both problems with high relief coins). [...] The President responded to express his interest on January 10, and Pratt was soon busy on a model for him to examine. [...] Roosevelt did not <b>then</b> <b>tell</b> the Mint of the new proposal.|$|E

According to Sonny Bono, [...] "Calling her {{butterfly}} tattoos nothing was like ignoring a sandstorm in the Mojave. That was exactly the effect Cher wanted to create. She liked {{to do things for}} the shock they created. She still does. She'll create some controversy and <b>then</b> <b>tell</b> her critics to stick it." [...] In the late 1990s, she began having laser treatments to remove her tattoos. The process was still underway in the 2000s. She commented, [...] "When I got tattooed, only bad girls did it: me and Janis Joplin and biker chicks. Now it doesn't mean anything. No one's surprised." [...] In 1992, Madame Tussauds wax museum honored Cher as one of the five [...] "most beautiful women of history" [...] by creating a life-size statue.

500|$|A {{television}} mini-series, The Legend of Billy Sing, was in post-production as of 2010. Despite {{some reports}} {{that it was}} based on Hamilton's book, the author maintained that he was never contacted by the film makers. Although Sing and his father were partly Chinese and fully Chinese, respectively, the mini-series portrayed them with actors of European ancestry. The director, Geoff Davis, was criticised for this decision. Politician Bill O'Chee, a member of the Billy Sing Commemorative Committee, said, [...] "When a person dies, all that is left is their story, and you can’t take a person’s name and not tell the truth about their story." [...] Davis has said, [...] "Whatever [...] genetic background, his culture was Australian. To me, he's very representative of every Australian whose parents were not born here. ...

500|$|Joshua Logan, in his memoirs, {{stated that}} {{after months of}} effort {{in the first half}} of 1948, Hammerstein had written only the first scene, an outline, and some lyrics. [...] Hammerstein was having trouble due to lack of {{knowledge}} of the military, a matter with which Logan, a veteran of the armed forces, was able to help. [...] The dialogue was written in consultation between the two of them, and eventually Logan asked to be credited for his work. [...] Rodgers and Hammerstein decided that while Logan would receive co-writing credit on the book, he would receive no author's royalties. Logan stated that a contract putting these changes into force was sent over to his lawyer with instructions that unless it was signed within two hours, Logan need not show up for rehearsals as director. Logan signed, although his lawyer did not <b>then</b> <b>tell</b> him about the ultimatum. [...] Through the decades that followed, Logan brought the matter up from time to time, demanding compensation, but when he included his version of the events in his 1976 memoirs, it was disputed by Rodgers (Hammerstein had died in 1960). [...] Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest suggests that Logan was compensated when South Pacific was filmed in 1958, as Logan received a substantial share of the profits as director. According to Michener biographer Stephen J. May, [...] "it is difficult to assess just how much of the final book Josh Logan was responsible for. [...] Some estimates say 30 to 40 percent. [...] But that percentage is not as critical perhaps as his knowledge of military lore and directing for the theatre, without which the creation of South Pacific would have collapsed during that summer of 1948." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the French crew is {{rescued by}} a cargo ship, and the U.S. Navy is {{deployed}} by NATO after getting {{word from the}} cargo ship captain that the pirates now have [...] "advanced weaponry" [...] (which was really just Kevin's toy lightsaber, that the French crew thought was real). Kyle arrives in Mogadishu, but is immediately taken captive by the pirates and held hostage. He pleads with Cartman to let him and his brother leave, but Cartman refuses, believing that Kyle is simply jealous of his new pirate life. Meanwhile, an English-speaking pirate named Guleed asks Butters and Ike why they decided to become pirates. When {{they say that they}} left because they were tired of things like school, chores, homework, and being yelled at by adults, Guleed responds by telling them that he dreamed of a simple life going to school, and that his mother is suffering with AIDS but cannot be treated, and his father was killed in an attempt to find food for his family. He never set out to be a pirate, but was forced into piracy to support his family. Butters and Ike end up realizing how close-minded they've been and that a life of piracy is one of hardship and suffering rather than fun and adventure like normal life can be. They <b>then</b> <b>tell</b> Cartman that they want to return home, but he refuses to give up his delusions of grandeur and threatens the boys with death by calling the real pirates to hold them at gunpoint. However, Cartman's vision is quickly disrupted when a U.S Navy ship hired by NATO appears off the coast carrying snipers, who shoot all of Cartman's pirate colleagues with a single gunshot to each of their heads. This leaves Cartman dumbfounded and annoyed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{development}} {{of the theory of}} Portuguese discovery of Australia owes much to Melbourne lawyer Kenneth McIntyre's 1977 book, The Secret Discovery of Australia; Portuguese ventures 200 years before Cook. McIntyre's book was reprinted in an abridged paperback edition in 1982 and again in 1987 and it was found on school history reading lists by the mid-1980s. According to Dr. Tony Disney, McIntyre's theory influenced a generation of history teachers in Australian schools. A TV documentary was made of the book in the 1980s by Michael Thornhill and McIntyre and the theory featured in many positive newspaper reviews and articles over the next twenty years. Australian history school textbooks also reflect the evolution of acceptance of his theories. The support of Dr. Helen Wallis, Curator of Maps at the British Library during her visits to Australia in the 1980s seemed to add academic weight to McIntyre's theory. In 1987, the Australian Minister for Science, Barry Jones, launching the Second Mahogany Ship Symposium in Warrnambool, said [...] "I read Kenneth McIntyre's important book... as soon as it appeared in 1977. I found its central argument... persuasive, if not conclusive." [...] The appearance of variant but essentially supporting theories in the late 1970s and early 1980s by other writers, including Ian McKiggan and Lawrence Fitzgerald also added credence to the theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia. In 1994, McIntyre expressed pleasure that his theory was gaining acceptance in Australia: [...] "It is gradually seeping through. The important thing is that... it has been on the school syllabus, and therefore students have... read about it. They in due course become teachers and... they will <b>then</b> <b>tell</b> their students and so on".|$|E
