25|$|Kissing was {{a custom}} during the Biblical period {{mentioned}} in the , when Isaac kissed his son Jacob. The kiss is used in numerous other contexts in the Bible: <b>the</b> <b>kiss</b> <b>of</b> homage, in Esther 5:2; of subjection, in 1 Samuel 10:1; of reconciliation, in 2 Samuel 14:33; of valediction, in Ruth 1:14; of approbation, in Psalms 2:12; of humble gratitude, in Luke 7:38; of welcome, in Exodus 18:7; of love and joy, in Genesis 20:11. There are also spiritual kisses, as in Canticles 1:2; sensual kisses, as in Proverbs 7:13; and hypocritical kisses, as in 2 Samuel 15:5. It was customary to kiss the mouth in biblical times, and also the beard, which is still practiced in Arab culture. Kissing the hand is not biblical, according to Tabor. <b>The</b> <b>kiss</b> <b>of</b> peace was an apostolic custom, {{and continues to be}} one of the rites in the Eucharistic services of Roman Catholics.|$|E
25|$|Among {{primitive}} cultures it was usual {{to throw}} kisses {{to the sun}} and to the moon, {{as well as to}} the images of the gods. Kissing the hand is first heard of among the Persians. According to Tabor, <b>the</b> <b>kiss</b> <b>of</b> homage—the character of which is not indicated in the Bible—was probably upon the forehead, and was expressive of high respect.|$|E

Its success was great, and Lord Leighton forthwith commissioned Icarus, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1884, along with a remarkable Study of a Head, and was received with general applause. Then followed The Enchanted Chair, which, along with many other works deemed by the artist incomplete or unworthy of his powers, was ultimately broken by the sculptors own hand.|$|E
25|$|The kiss on {{the lips}} can be {{performed}} between two friends or family. This move aims to express the affection that you have for a friend. Unlike kissing for love, a friendly kiss has no sexual connotation. The {{kiss on the}} lips is a practice {{that can be found}} in the time of Patriarchs (Bible). In Ancient Greece, the kiss on the mouth was used to express a concept of equality between people of the same rank. In the Middle Ages, <b>the</b> <b>kiss</b> <b>of</b> peace was recommended by the Catholic Church. The kiss on the lips was also common among knights. The gesture has again become popular with young people, particularly in England.|$|E

500|$|Peter Doyle may be {{the most}} likely {{candidate}} for the love of Whitman's life. Doyle was a bus conductor whom Whitman met around 1866, and the two were inseparable for several years. Interviewed in 1895, Doyle said: [...] "We were familiar at once—I put my hand on his knee—we understood. He did not get {{out at the end of}} the trip—in fact went all the way back with me." [...] In his notebooks, Whitman disguised Doyle's initials using the code [...] "16.4" [...] (P.D. being the 16th and 4th letters of the alphabet). Oscar Wilde met Whitman in America in 1882 and told the homosexual-rights activist George Cecil Ives that Whitman's sexual orientation was beyond question —"I have <b>the</b> <b>kiss</b> <b>of</b> Walt Whitman still on my lips." [...] The only explicit description of Whitman's sexual activities is secondhand. In 1924, Edward Carpenter told Gavin Arthur of a sexual encounter in his youth with Whitman, the details of which Arthur recorded in his journal. Late in his life, when Whitman was asked outright whether his [...] "Calamus" [...] poems were homosexual, he chose not to respond. The manuscript of his love poem [...] "Once I Pass'd Through A Populous City", written when Whitman was 29, indicates it was originally about a man.|$|E

500|$|Earl Cain {{contains}} {{references to}} real-life people and literary works. The first Godchild chapter, [...] "Mad Tea Party", {{focuses on a}} mystery with elements from Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, a work which Yuki has expressed her fondness for. Yuki's minor character, Victoria, was inspired by Carroll's character, the Queen of Hearts. Carroll's 1876 nonsense poem, The Hunting of the Snark, provided Yuki {{with the name of}} Jizabel's childhood pet, Snark. Additionally, the title of the third part of the series, Kafka, refers to the Austrian writer Franz Kafka, and a translation of the first line of his 1915 novella The Metamorphosis appears {{in the beginning of the}} volume. Yuki also based the story of Mikaila on the fairytale [...] "Mermaid Princess". The chapter [...] "Oedipal Blade" [...] takes its name from the Greek character Oedipus Rex, who unknowingly killed his father and married his mother. Yuki also incorporates tales for children and lullabies into the mysteries of the series; for example, the chapter [...] "Solomon Grundy's Sunday" [...] uses the nursery rhyme [...] "Solomon Grundy", while [...] "The Twisted Fairy Tale" [...] refers to the Brothers Grimm fairytale [...] "The Juniper Tree". References to the bible also appear in the series. The protagonist shares his name with the murderer Cain, and Augusta is compared to Delilah by her father. Additionally, the series alludes to the story of <b>the</b> <b>Kiss</b> <b>of</b> Judas, in which Judas Iscariot betrays Jesus of Nazareth to Roman soldiers by identifying him through a kiss.|$|E
500|$|The medley track [...] "Like a Virgin/Hollywood" [...] was {{performed}} {{during the opening}} of the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards on August 27, 2003, where Madonna was joined by Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Missy Elliott. The performance started with Spears appearing on stage on top of a giant wedding cake while wearing a wedding gown and veil; she sang the first few lines of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] before Aguilera appeared from behind the cake and joined her. Madonna then emerged from the cake wearing a black coat and a hat and started singing [...] "Hollywood" [...] before proceeding to kiss Spears and Aguilera on the lips. Missy Elliott came out from a wedding chapel to sing her song [...] "Work It" [...] halfway through the performance. The kiss generated strong reaction from the media. Feminist author Camille Paglia described the moment as great; she noted that the kiss was like Madonna saying to Spears, [...] "I'm passing the torch to you." [...] However, according to her, Spears could not take advantage of the kiss as later her career and lifestyle came under immense media scrutiny and criticism. Paglia said that [...] "literally from that kiss, from that moment onward, Britney has spiraled out of control. It's like Madonna gave her <b>the</b> <b>kiss</b> <b>of</b> death!" [...] Madonna commented on the kiss; [...] "I am the mommy pop star and she is the baby pop star. And I am kissing her to pass my energy on to her." [...] This performance was listed by Blender magazine as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history. MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moments in the history of MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E
