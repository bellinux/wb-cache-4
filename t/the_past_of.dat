Through this propagandist connection to Clovis, the fleur-de-lis has been taken in retrospect to symbolize all the Christian Frankish kings, most notably Charlemagne.|$|E

The colossal Buddha of the shrine has an elaborate throne back, but was hastily finished in 477/478 CE, when king Harisena died. The shrine antechamber of the cave features an unfinished sculptural group of the Six Buddhas of <b>the</b> <b>Past,</b> <b>of</b> which only five statues were carved. This idea may have been influenced from those in Bagh Caves of Madhya Pradesh.|$|E

Between 40 BC-36 BC, they lived with their mother and their {{stepfather}} Triumvir Mark Antony in Athens, Greece. After 36 BC they accompanied their mother when she returned to Rome with their siblings. They were raised and educated by their mother, their maternal uncle, Roman emperor Augustus, and their maternal aunt-in-marriage Roman Empress Livia Drusilla. These two daughters of Octavia Minor and Gaius Claudius Marcellus with their siblings, provide a critical link between <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>of</b> the Roman Republic and the new Roman Empire. The marriages of the sisters and the children born to their unions assured republican family lines into the next generation.|$|E

25|$|Since it was {{perceived}} by the Maya that sickness was a punishment for a mistake or transgression, {{it was important that}} the healer inquire about details of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>of</b> the sick person. This was done in a methodological fashion, first inquiring about ascriptive attributes, followed by specific events of the person’s life, and lastly about circumstantial or acquired attributes. This aspect of the medicine man’s job would be similar to a modern-day therapy session. In addition to ritualistic and spiritual elements, the medicine man had extensive knowledge of medicinal plants and how they should be used. After studying the symptoms of a sickness, a medicine man may prescribe a remedy to his patient. The number of times or days that the remedy should be ingested or applied depended on an individual’s gender; typically the number thirteen was associated with men, and the number nine with women.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to explain}} the meaning of counter-factual in {{sentences}} with 'HAZU'. Assuming {{that there are two}} kinds of 'HAZU'which expresses counter-factual meaning, one which is used in conditionals which have counter-factual meanings, and one which is used in non-conditionals with <b>the</b> form 'HAZUDATTA'(the <b>past</b> tense form <b>of</b> 'HAZU'). In general, <b>the</b> <b>past</b> form <b>of</b> 'HAZU'cannot directly express the counter-factual meaning without any supporting context. This paper proposes that <b>the</b> <b>past</b> form <b>of</b> 'HAZU'can express the counter-factual meaning without any contexts, if and only if the basic form of active verbs modify it and is not used with triggers like 'TASHIKA', which is an adverb used to remind a speaker's memory. It is because <b>the</b> <b>past</b> form <b>of</b> 'HAZU'means <b>the</b> <b>past</b> inference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speaker and the basic form of an active verb means the irrealis-event yet to happen...|$|R
