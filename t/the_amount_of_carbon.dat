Thermohaline circulation exchanges carbon between these two layers.|$|E

40|$|Activity Focus: Students {{investigate}} <b>the</b> {{type and}} <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> materials ejected by a volcanic eruption {{and how these}} materials might affect the atmosphere. Based on data and information, students decide the role volcanic activity plays in respect to global temperature {{as compared to the}} affect human activity may have on global temperature. Major Concepts: Volcanoes are single events that add material to the atmosphere. Some of this material {{is in the form of}} greenhouse gasses (water vapor and carbon dioxide) which may encourage atmospheric warming (the greenhouse effect). Volcanoes also eject sulfur which forms a mist when combined with water. This mist forms particulates called aerosols that move high into the upper atmosphere and act as a reflector that reflects sunlight back into space. Sulfur aerosols persist for months and even years to block sunlight which results in a cooling effect. Therefore, volcanic activity tends to cool the atmosphere. The cooling effect of volcanoes is documented with examples. Regarding <b>carbon</b> dioxide, <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide contributed to the atmosphere by volcanic eruptions are shown to be insignificant when compared to <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide contributed by human activity...|$|R
5|$|Under {{terrestrial}} conditions, {{conversion of}} one element to another is very rare. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> on Earth is effectively constant. Thus, processes that use carbon must obtain it from somewhere {{and dispose of}} it somewhere else. The paths of carbon in the environment form the carbon cycle. For example, photosynthetic plants draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (or seawater) and build it into biomass, as in the Calvin cycle, a process of carbon fixation. Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, while some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide. The carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop; for example, some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans; if bacteria do not consume it, dead plant or animal matter may become petroleum or coal, which releases carbon when burned.|$|E
5|$|While {{operating}} in all-electric mode the Volt produces no tailpipe emissions. In this mode {{there is an}} absence of harmful chemical emissions that can negatively impact air quality, allowing for a continuous clean air benefit. There is also a lack of carbon dioxide emissions. However, this benefit is mostly local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, these emissions are shifted to the location of the electricity generation plants. <b>The</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide emitted depends on the emission intensity of the power source used to charge the vehicle. When the Volt's battery is depleted and the gasoline-powered engine engages, the plug-in emissions are similar to other internal combustion engine vehicles. The amount of total local emissions depends on how much the Volt is driven in all-electric mode and how much in charge-sustaining mode.|$|E
