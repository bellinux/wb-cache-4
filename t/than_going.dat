5|$|Service on the Orange Line {{began on}} November 20, 1978 between National Airport and New Carrollton, with five new {{stations}} {{being added to}} the existing network from Stadium–Armory. When the line from Rosslyn to Ballston–MU was completed on December 11, 1979, Orange Line trains began following this route rather <b>than</b> <b>going</b> to the National Airport station. The line was completed on June 7, 1986, when it was extended by four stations to Vienna in the I-66 median.|$|E
5|$|The coup {{ultimately}} failed, as it {{met with}} the resistance {{of most of the}} warriors, who were opposed to the king's assassination. As a result, the Lombard garrison in Ticinum proclaimed Duke Cleph the new king, and Helmichis, rather <b>than</b> <b>going</b> to war against overwhelming odds, escaped to Ravenna with Longinus' assistance, taking with him his wife, his troops, the royal treasure and Alboin's daughter Albsuinda. In Ravenna the two lovers became estranged and killed each other. Subsequently, Longinus sent Albsuinda and the treasure to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|A senior {{national}} team official, Colonel Roman Lisiewicz of the Polish Army, {{said he saw}} the goalkeeper and the journalist reach the hotel in a taxi soon after 05:00—but rather <b>than</b> <b>going</b> to his room, Młynarczyk then left again with Zieliński before returning again around 07:00. Tired and hungover, Młynarczyk joined {{the rest of the}} players for breakfast, and according to Terlecki spent most of the meal getting worked up about possible managerial retribution. Młynarczyk was in such bad shape that he was unable to carry his own bags; Smolarek took them for him. Next to the team bus, one of Kulesza's assistants, Bernard Blaut, confronted Smolarek and told him that Młynarczyk was to stay behind.|$|E

5|$|Rather <b>than</b> <b>going</b> to war, Helmichis, Rosamund {{and their}} {{followers}} escaped to Ravenna, {{the capital of}} Byzantine Italy, where they were received with full honours by the authorities. Once in Ravenna, Rosamund was persuaded by the Byzantine prefect Longinus to kill Helmichis {{in order to be}} free to marry him. Rosamund proceeded to poison Helmichis, but the latter, having understood what his wife had done to him, forced her to drink the cup too, so both of them died. After their deaths, Longinus dispatched Helmichis' forces to Constantinople, while the remaining Lombards had already found a new king in Cleph.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence {{for the murder}} of her five children. The court and the jury did not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her closing argument, Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not be held accountable for her actions. They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather <b>than</b> <b>going</b> to prison, but the jury did not follow their opinions. Lhermitte had been battling with depression for many years. She concluded that she saw the murder of her children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E
5|$|This {{station was}} rebuilt as Ashford International {{during the early}} 1990s for {{international}} services from mainland Europe; this included the addition of two platforms {{to the north of}} station (the original down island platform had been taken over by international services). Unlike normal LGV stations in France, the through tracks for Ashford International railway station are off to one side rather <b>than</b> <b>going</b> through. The number of services was reduced after the opening of the Ebbsfleet station. A high-speed domestic service operated by Southeastern to London St Pancras began on 29 June 2009.|$|E

5|$|Movie {{director}} Kevin Smith {{has been}} a fan of the Degrassi series from the early 1990s, when he worked at a convenience store in Leonardo, New Jersey. Actor Jason Mewes was his co-worker at the store and also became a fan. Every Sunday morning at work, Smith and Mewes watched episodes of Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High on Public Broadcasting Service. Smith enjoyed the earlier series and has acknowledged an infatuation with Stacie Mistysyn. He has also paid homage to Degrassi by referring to it in several of his films. He named a Clerks character Caitlin Bree after Mistysin's Degrassi character, Caitlin Ryan, wrote Shannen Doherty's character Rene wearing a Degrassi jacket throughout his Mallrats film, and had Jason Lee's character in Chasing Amy specifically mention Degrassi Junior High as a TV show he wants to watch, rather <b>than</b> <b>going</b> out. Smith and Mewes guest starred as themselves in the final three episodes of the fourth season. The plot for these episodes involves the pair working on Jay and Silent Bob Go Canadian, Eh!, a fictional feature film in the View Askewniverse, using Degrassi Community School as a filming location.|$|E
5|$|The highway enters Geneseo {{from the}} south, taking the name Genesee Street {{as it passes}} {{the western edge of}} the campus of SUNY Geneseo. At the edge of the campus, the route crosses the Genesee River and exits Geneseo. Past the river in the town of York, NY63 begins to curve {{northwest}} up and out of the Genesee River valley until it runs east–west once again at the hamlet of Piffard. The major junction in York is the community of Greigsville, where NY63 reconnects with NY36. This next section of highway has become a major shortcut for traffic heading to the Buffalo area, despite remaining a two-lane road through open rural country, since it is both physically shorter <b>than</b> <b>going</b> all the way to the New York State Thruway as well as toll-free. Most of this Buffalo-bound traffic follows NY36 north from Mount Morris and turns on to NY63 here. Signage along this route reflects this use.|$|E
25|$|In early May 2010, it was {{reported}} that Dreamworld was evaluating the possibility to incorporate Illuminate into night dance parties. Rather <b>than</b> <b>going</b> ahead with dance parties, Dreamworld began to incorporate the show into the existing Screamworld night events.|$|E

25|$|After World War I, Scripps and Ritter became {{convinced}} that nations needed a forum to rationally work out their differences, rather <b>than</b> <b>going</b> to war. They became great advocates for the League of Nations, believing {{it could be an}} alternative to war.|$|E
25|$|After the war {{passenger}} {{numbers were}} still rising, tempted by the frequent services and competitive prices. Even in 1969, travelling by rail was cheaper <b>than</b> <b>going</b> by bus: a return rail ticket from Barcombe Mills to Brighton cost 2 shillings, whilst the bus fare was 11d more expensive.|$|E
25|$|In 1788, Thomas Jefferson {{suggested}} that the Spanish should create it since {{it would be a}} less treacherous route <b>than</b> <b>going</b> around the southern tip of South America, which tropical ocean currents would naturally widen thereafter. During an expedition from 1788 to 1793, Alessandro Malaspina outlined plans for its construction.|$|E
50|$|Australian {{migration}} to the United States is greater <b>than</b> Americans <b>going</b> to Australia. At the 2006 census, 71,718 Australian residents declared that they were American-born, a smaller population than the population estimate of Australians living in the United States.|$|R

25|$|One month later, this spur was reassigned {{as part of}} SH 118. At that time, SH 118 {{south of}} Alpine {{departed}} from its present route near Adobe Walls Mountain to Terlingua rather <b>than</b> <b>going</b> directly to Study Butte as it does today. From Terlingua, SH 118 then proceeded eastward through Study Butte to SH 227.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} {{the high number of}} people driving under a Provisional Licence under the old system was because a Provisional Licence holder could drive unaccompanied after obtaining their second Provisional Licence, and many drivers chose this route rather <b>than</b> <b>going</b> through the full testing process. This is system was very unusual - Most countries' provisional/learner {{licences}} require a fully qualified driver to accompany a learner.|$|E
25|$|Regarded as Great Britain's best {{gold medal}} hope in athletics, her {{withdrawal}} made {{headlines in the}} UK, with editorial stances ranging from support to negativity, with some newspapers deriding Radcliffe for 'quitting', rather <b>than</b> <b>going</b> on to finish the race.

25|$|Law was the Archbishop of Boston from 1984 {{until his}} {{resignation}} on December 13, 2002, {{in response to}} the Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal after church documents showed he had extensive knowledge of sexual abuse committed by dozens of Catholic priests within his archdiocese. One priest alone was alleged to have raped or molested 130 children over decades, while Law and other local officials moved him among churches rather <b>than</b> <b>going</b> to the authorities.|$|E
25|$|South of Derby, {{the road}} is paralleled by the M1 motorway, between Manchester and Preston the M6 and M61 {{motorways}} approximate its course, and from Preston to its northern terminus in Carlisle it is paralleled by the M6 only. Between Derby and Manchester the A6 follows a completely different routing to the motorway network, crossing the Peak District rather <b>than</b> <b>going</b> around it. Because of these duplications, the A6 {{is less important than}} it was formerly.|$|E
25|$|A narrow {{grid system}} of streets was {{approved}} by the District government for undeveloped areas in 1886 and imposed on the Marshall Heights area, ignoring the steep hills rather <b>than</b> <b>going</b> around them. Street names originally reflected major cities in the United States (Atlanta, Baltimore, Columbus, Charleston, Mobile, Newark, Trenton, Raleigh, Richmond, St. Louis, Wilmington), with a few named for trees (Beech, Mulberry, Palm, Sycamore, Walnut). Except for the new Central Avenue and St. Louis Street, every new road in the area would later be renamed.|$|E
50|$|Without the {{guidance}} provided by lane markings, drivers {{in the early}} days often erred in favor of keeping closer {{to the middle of the}} road, rather <b>than</b> risk <b>going</b> off-road into ditches or trees. This practice often left inadequate room for opposing traffic.|$|R
