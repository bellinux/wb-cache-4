50|$|Moreover, {{laboratory}} {{drying rack}} {{can be used}} to drain other types of laboratory glassware as well. For instance, in terms of funnel, it is used to dry up separating funnel, dropping funnel, filter funnel, and <b>Thistle</b> <b>funnel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Concentrated sulpuric {{acid and}} nitric acid {{cannot be used}} for this process as they oxidise {{hydrogen}} sulphide to sulphur. A Woulf's bottle is fitted with a <b>thistle</b> <b>funnel</b> and a delivery tube. Diluted H2SO4 is run down the funnel so as to cover the iron sulphide placed at bottom of the bottle. When iron sulphide reacts with diluted sulphuric acid, hydrogen sulphide is formed which is collected in the gas jar by upward displacement of air.|$|E
50|$|A thistle tube is a {{piece of}} {{laboratory}} glassware consisting of a shaft of tube, with a reservoir and funnel-like section at the top. Thistle tubes are typically used by chemists to add liquid to an existing system or apparatus. <b>Thistle</b> <b>funnels</b> are used to add small volumes of liquids to an exact position. <b>Thistle</b> <b>funnels</b> are found with taps or without taps.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds of funnels that have been adapted for specialized applications in the laboratory. Filter <b>funnels,</b> <b>thistle</b> <b>funnels</b> (shaped like <b>thistle</b> flowers), and dropping funnels have stopcocks which allow the fluids to be added to a flask slowly. For solids, a powder funnel with a wide and short stem is more appropriate as it does not clog easily.|$|R
