5|$|A free {{jazz and}} {{contemporary}} classical work, Ten Freedom Summers comprises 19 pieces that are mostly fully developed suites. They eschew conventional themes for abstract {{expressions of the}} subject matter, which focuses on <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Movement</b> <b>and</b> other interrelated topics. Smith cites the segregation of his native Mississippi and playwright August Wilson's The Pittsburgh Cycle as inspirations behind the work. Ten Freedom Summers received widespread critical acclaim and was named {{a finalist for the}} Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Emanuel's father, Benjamin M. Emanuel, is a Jerusalem-born {{pediatrician}} at Michael Reese Hospital who {{was once}} {{a member of the}} Irgun, a Jewish paramilitary organization that operated in British Mandate Palestine. His mother, Marsha (née Smulevitz), is the daughter of a West Side Chicago union organizer who worked in <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement,</b> <b>and</b> briefly owned a local rock and roll club and later became an adherent of Benjamin Spock's writings. Emanuel's parents met during the 1950s in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Mississippi Burning became {{embroiled in}} controversy; it was heavily criticized for its fictionalization of history by African-American activists {{involved}} in <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Movement</b> <b>and</b> {{the families of}} Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner. Critical reaction was mixed, though the performances of Hackman, Dafoe and Frances McDormand were generally praised. Mississippi Burning grossed $34.6 million in North American box-office revenue. The film received seven Academy Awards nominations, including Best Picture, but won only for Best Cinematography.|$|E
40|$|At Cal Poly, demonstrations for <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement</b> {{were not}} very common but when they were, they made headlines. The war in Vietnam far overshadowed <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement</b> at Cal Poly due simply to its {{demographics}} at the time. The population at Cal Poly, {{as well as the}} surrounding areas, was lacking diversity, making <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement</b> less of a priority for many. Perhaps if <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement</b> was taken more seriously during its time of relevance, more African Americans would have became inclined to attend Cal Poly and get involved in what was happening. However, in a city and college with little African American presence, little was done...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to aiding abolitionism, many Christians made further efforts toward establishing racial equality, contributing to <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Movement.</b> <b>The</b> African American Review notes {{the important role}} Christian revivalism in the black church played in <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Movement.</b> Martin Luther King, Jr., an ordained Baptist minister, was a leader of <b>the</b> American <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Movement</b> {{and president of the}} Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a Christian <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> organization.|$|R

5|$|When the country's {{fortunes}} turned {{during the}} Great Depression, the violent Teamsters Strike of 1934 resulted in laws acknowledging workers' rights. A lifelong {{civil rights activist}} and union supporter, mayor Hubert Humphrey helped the city establish fair employment practices and a human relations council that interceded on behalf of minorities by 1946. In the 1950s, about 1.6% {{of the population of}} Minneapolis was nonwhite. Minneapolis contended with white supremacy, participated in desegregation and <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement,</b> <b>and</b> in 1968 was the birthplace of the American Indian Movement.|$|E
5|$|While {{attending}} Antioch College in {{the early}} 1960s, Gould was active in <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement</b> <b>and</b> often campaigned for social justice. When he attended the University of Leeds as a visiting undergraduate, he organized weekly demonstrations outside a Bradford dance hall which refused to admit black people. Gould continued these demonstrations until the policy was revoked. Throughout his career and writings, he spoke out against cultural oppression in all its forms, especially {{what he saw as}} the pseudoscience used in the service of racism and sexism.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1960s, {{explicit}} sexuality of {{any kind}} was rare in speculative fiction, as the editors who controlled what was published attempted to protect their perceived key market of adolescent male readers. As the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals, though these tended to be villains, and lesbians remained almost entirely unrepresented. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement</b> <b>and</b> {{the emergence of a}} counterculture. New wave and feminist science fiction authors realised cultures in which homosexuality, bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm, and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality were commonplace.|$|E

50|$|Progressive social reforms, from <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act to <b>the</b> Clean Water Act, tend {{to occur}} {{during times of}} {{prosperity}} and rising expectations—not immiseration and declining expectations. Both the environmental <b>movement</b> and <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement</b> emerged {{as a consequence of}} rising prosperity. It was the middle-class, young, and educated black Americans who were on the forefront of <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement.</b> Poor blacks were active, but the movement was overwhelmingly led by educated, middle-class intellectuals and community leaders (preachers prominent among them). This was also the case with the white supporters of <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement,</b> who tended to be more highly educated and more affluent than the general American population. In short, <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement</b> no more emerged because African Americans were suddenly denied their freedom than the environmental movement emerged because America suddenly started polluting.|$|R
5|$|Concerned that {{allegations}} of communists in the SCLC, if made public, would derail the administration's civil rights initiatives, Kennedy warned King to discontinue these associations, and later {{felt compelled to}} issue the written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover feared <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>movement</b> <b>and</b> investigated the {{allegations of}} communist infiltration. When no evidence emerged to support this, the FBI used the incidental details caught on tape {{over the next five}} years in attempts to force King out of his leadership position, in the COINTELPRO program.|$|E
5|$|The Heart of a Woman (1981) is an {{autobiography}} by American writer Maya Angelou. The {{book is the}} fourth installment in Angelou's series of seven autobiographies. The Heart of a Woman recounts events in Angelou's life between 1957 and 1962 and follows her travels to California, New York City, Cairo, and Ghana as she raises her teenage son, becomes a published author, becomes active in <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement,</b> <b>and</b> becomes romantically involved with a South African anti-apartheid fighter. One {{of the most important}} themes of The Heart of a Woman is motherhood, as Angelou continues to raise her son. The book ends with her son leaving for college and Angelou looking forward to newfound independence and freedom.|$|E
5|$|Angelou's {{primary role}} in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas was stage performer, but in The Heart of a Woman she changes {{from someone who}} uses others' method of expression—the songs and dances of the African, Caribbean, and African-American oral tradition—to a writer. Angelou makes this {{decision}} for political reasons as she becomes more involved with <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement,</b> <b>and</b> {{so that she can}} care for her son. For the first time in Angelou's autobiographies, she begins to think of herself as a writer and recounts her literary development. Angelou begins to identify with other Black women writers {{for the first time in}} The Heart of a Woman. She has been influenced by several writers since her childhood, but this is the first time she mentions female authors. Up to this point, her identification has been with male writers; her new affiliations with female writers is due to her emerging feminism.|$|E

5|$|Homophile organizations—as {{homosexual}} {{groups were}} called—grew {{in number and}} spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. Frank Kameny founded the Mattachine of Washington, D.C. He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at mental health professionals, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal. In 1965, Kameny, inspired by the Civil Rights Movement, organized a picket of the White House and other government buildings to protest employment discrimination. The pickets shocked many gay people, and upset some of the leadership of Mattachine and the DOB. At the same time, demonstrations in <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Movement</b> <b>and</b> opposition to the Vietnam War all grew in prominence, frequency, and severity throughout the 1960s, as did their confrontations with police forces.|$|E
5|$|The PTC {{also has}} an Advisory Board {{consisting}} of politicians and entertainers working to assist the council in their goal of protecting children against profanity and violence in the media. Notable members of the advisory board include singer Pat Boone, former football player Mel Renfro, writer-producer Coleman Luck, country musician Billy Ray Cyrus, comedian and actor Tim Conway of CBS's The Carol Burnett Show, former U.S. Senator from Kansas and 2008 presidential candidate Sam Brownback, film critic Michael Medved, star of 1980s soap opera Dallas Susan Howard, and ION Television producer Gary Johnson. In addition, the PTC has established numerous local chapters for most American media markets. Notable former Advisory Board members include - {{both of whom are}} now deceased - comedian Steve Allen, original host of NBC's The Tonight Show, and C. Delores Tucker, participant in <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Movement</b> <b>and</b> activist against gangsta rap music; Allen is now given the title of National Honorary Chairman-Emeritus.
