The lecturer would discuss and analyze juridic texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as Ulpian.

This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{focused on}} the <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> as a panacea for {{effective}} curriculum implementation in the classroom in Nigeria. <b>Teaching</b> <b>methods</b> denote various strategies that the teacher uses to deliver his/her subject matter to {{the students in the}} classroom based on the instructional objectives to bring about learning. <b>Teaching</b> <b>methods</b> aids learning and help to communicate ideas and skills to the students. There are several <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> to use in the classrooms, it is left for the teacher to use the ones most appropriate for the lesson. These methods if properly used will enhance teaching and learning and bring about desired changes in the students. While the teacher’s task is to ensure that learning is effective, one major way to achieve this is the use of appropriate <b>teaching</b> <b>methods.</b> This paper examines the concept of teaching, the teacher, learning, and discussed various <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> {{that can be used in}} the classrooms. The paper further discussed curriculum implementation and its implication for <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> and proffered the way forward for an effective use of <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> for better results in the classroom teaching and learning process...|$|R
40|$|Past {{research}} {{has suggested that}} <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> are a potential way to decrease mind wandering in order to increase information retention, leading to greater academic achievement in higher education. In the current study, mind wandering rates are compared during interactive and non-interactive <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> {{through the use of a}} probe-caught, experience-sampling method during three almost identically delivered first-year psychology lectures. Five hundred and twenty eight student volunteers provided their mind wandering status at four times during the 50 -minute lectures. Probes one and four followed noninteractive <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> (lecturing to a PowerPoint slide), whereas probes two and three followed interactive <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> (questioning and student-involved demonstration). It was predicted that the interactive <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> would be associated with lower levels of mind wandering than the non-interactive <b>teaching</b> <b>methods.</b> Between the interactive <b>teaching</b> <b>methods,</b> it was predicted that the student-involved demonstration would be associated with lower levels of mind wandering than questioning. In support of hypothesis one, a chi-square contingency test revealed a significant difference between interactive and non-interactive <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> χ 2 (2) = 40. 95, p <. 001, Cramer’s V =. 28, where non-interactive <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> (22 % mind wandering) were associated with higher levels of mind wandering than interactive <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> of a demonstration and questioning (3. 5 % and 4. 5 %, respectively).

40|$|Ethical {{instruction}} {{is critical for}} trainee accountants. Various <b>teaching</b> <b>methods,</b> both active and passive, are normally utilised when teaching accounting ethics. However, students' learning styles are rarely assessed. This study evaluates the learning styles of accounting students and assesses the interaction of <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> and learning styles in an ethics instruction environment. The ethical attitudes and preferred learning styles of a cohort (137) of final year accounting students were evaluated preinstruction. They were then subject to three different <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> while studying ethics during an auditing course. When ethical attitudes and preferred learning styles were reassessed post-instruction, the <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> {{were found to have}} influenced active learners more than passive ones. Furthermore, when learning styles matched <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> used, usefulness was assessed as high but when learning styles and <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> differed, usefulness deteriorated significantly. Students displayed a preference for passive learning styles, despite being so advanced in their education. The implications are that instructors should consider learning styles before deciding on appropriate <b>teaching</b> <b>methods,</b> in accounting ethics environments.

25|$|The {{notion of}} {{evidence}} based practice {{has also had}} an influence {{in the field of}} education. Here, some commentators have suggested that the putative lack of any conspicuous progress is attributable to practice resting in the unconnected and noncumulative experience of thousands of individual teachers, each re-inventing the wheel and failing to learn from hard scientific evidence about 'what works'. Opponents of this view argue that hard scientific evidence is a misnomer in education; knowing that a drug works (in medicine) is entirely different from knowing that a <b>teaching</b> <b>method</b> works, for the latter will depend on a host of factors, not least those to do with the style, personality and beliefs of the teacher and the needs of the particular children (Hammersley 2013). Some opponents of EBP in education suggest that teachers need to develop their own personal practice, dependent on personal knowledge garnered through their own experience. Others argue that this must be combined with research evidence, but without the latter being treated as a privileged source.|$|E

40|$|There is an {{abundance}} of data that suggest that implementing active <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> in the classroom produces a deeper, longer lasting understanding and increased enjoyment of course material. However, most engineering educators do not employ these techniques. This paper addresses {{three of the most}} common concerns these educators have: 1. “I don’t have enough time,” 2. “It is difficult to employ active teaching techniques with my course material,” and 3. “I won’t be able to cover all my material if I allow time for the activities in class. ”. Active teaching was employed in two courses in order to improve student enthusiasm for course material and increase understanding of that material. In each course, specific topics were taught using active <b>teaching</b> <b>methods,</b> while others were taught using traditional <b>teaching</b> <b>methods.</b> The active <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> employed were simple methods that were uncomplicated to prepare, often requiring less than five minutes of preparation per lecture. The effectiveness of these <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> was compared in three ways. First, students’ non-verbal responses to the <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> were observed by an independent researcher trained in direct nonparticipation data collection. Both active and traditional lectures were observed using a modified rubric based on Ekman and Friesen’s facial measurement system, which systematized and validated the observations. Second, students’ test scores on topics taught by active <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> were compared to scores on topics taught by traditional methods. Third, students were surveyed on their perspective of the effectiveness of the active <b>teaching</b> <b>methods.</b> This data was compared to the time required to prepare these lectures and the amount of material covered. Results show that, without fail, students were more engaged and scored higher on topics covered using simple active <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> as opposed to traditional lectures. Students’ participation levels significantly increased during all aspects of lectures that included active <b>teaching</b> <b>methods,</b> including short periods of traditional lecture that followed the activity. Student surveys suggest that, although students’ perception of active <b>teaching</b> <b>methods</b> was mixed to start the semester, the acceptance of these methods {{by the end of the}} semester had increased to 100 % and many students desired more active opportunities.
