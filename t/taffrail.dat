25|$|The stern is {{the back}} or aft-most {{part of a}} ship or boat, {{technically}} defined as the area built up over the sternpost, extending upwards from the counter rail to the <b>taffrail.</b> The stern lies opposite of the bow, the foremost part of a ship. Originally, the term only referred to the aft port section of the ship, but eventually came {{to refer to the}} entire back of a vessel. The stern end of a ship is indicated with a white navigation light at night.|$|E
25|$|As {{ships of}} wooden {{construction}} {{gave way to}} iron and steel, the cruiser stern—another design without transoms and known variously as the canoe stern, parabolic stern, and the double-ended stern—became the next prominent development in ship stern design, particularly in warships of {{the latter half of}} the 20th century. The intent of this re-design was to protect the steering gear by bringing it below the armor deck. The stern now came to a point rather than a flat panel or a gentle curve, and the counter reached from the sternpost all the way to the <b>taffrail</b> in a continuous arch. It was soon discovered that vessels with cruiser sterns experienced less water resistance when under way than those with elliptical sterns, and between World War I and World War II most merchant ship designs soon followed suit.|$|E
25|$|The reverse stern, reverse {{transom stern}}, sugar-scoop, or retroussé stern {{is a kind}} of transom stern that is raked {{backwards}} (common on modern yachts, rare on vessels before the 20th century); the vertical transom stern or plumb stern is raked neither forward nor back, but falls directly from the <b>taffrail</b> down to the wing transom. The rocket ship stern is a term for an extremely angled retroussé stern. A double ended ship with a very narrow square counter formed from the bulwarks or upper deck above the head of the rudder is said to have a pink stern or pinky stern. The torpedo stern or torpedo-boat stern describes a kind of stern with a low rounded shape that is nearly flat at the waterline, but which then slopes upward in a conical fashion towards the deck (practical for small high-speed power boats with very shallow drafts).|$|E
25|$|Astraea {{went ahead}} {{in pursuit of}} the first French frigate, {{which turned out to be}} Étoile. Astraea {{exchanged}} a broadside and then crossed Étoiles bow and raked her. At this moment a shot took away Astraeas wheel and killed both quartermasters, causing Astraea to lose direction and momentum. Now the situation reversed, with French guns nearly touching Astraeas <b>taffrail.</b> She received broadsides that tore away her lower rigging, scarred her deck and destroyed one of her carronades. However, she suffered no damage forward. Astrea was able to get starboard to starboard with her opponent. The two vessels exchanged broadsides at close range for two hours until Étoile sailed off. During the engagement a pistol shot hit Eveleigh below the heart, mortally wounding him. Sultane came up and also exchanged a broadside with Astraea. Astraea, much damaged, broke off the engagement as the two French frigates too sailed away. Creole had suffered ten men dead and 26 wounded; Astraea lost nine men dead and 37 wounded. That evening the two British ships anchored in Porto Praya on Santiago to effect repairs.|$|E
25|$|Before dawn on 18 October 1806 Tobago left Dominica {{where she}} had been {{replenishing}} her water supplies. Soon after, Salmon sighted a brig, joined by a schooner and a sloop, that all made towards Tobago. Tobago prepared for action, while attempting to steer away from the probably hostile squadron. The enemy closed by 8:30, with the schooner and sloop exchanging fire with Tobago. The French attempted to board, but Tobago repulsed the attempt. She was not able to escape though, and the French schooner was able to get her jib-boom over Tobagos <b>taffrail</b> and rake her with small arms fire. Salmon received a shot in the head and his men took him below decks. Sub-Lieutenant Nichols Gould assumed command and continued the fight for another half-hour but then, with Tobago having lost one man killed and 15 wounded (including Salmon), was forced to strike. Her captor was the French privateer General Ernouf, of 16 guns. Général Ernouf (1805 - 1808), was a Danish 16-gun brig, originally under the command of the notable French privateer captain Alexis Grassin.|$|E
2500|$|Stern timbers (also called stern frames) – These timbers {{are mounted}} {{vertically}} in a series; each timber typically rests or [...] "steps" [...] {{on the wing}} transom and then stretches out (aft) and upward. Those not reaching {{all the way to}} the <b>taffrail</b> are called short stern timbers, while those that do are called long stern timbers. The two outermost of these timbers, located at the corners of the stern, are called the side-counter timbers or outer stern timbers. It is the stern timbers collectively which determine the backward slope of the square stern, called its [...] -- that is, if the stern [...] timbers end up producing a final transom that falls vertically to the water, this is considered a transom with no rake; if the stern timbers produce a stern with some degree of slope, such a stern is considered a raked stern.|$|E
2500|$|She only {{spent four}} years with the French, before forming part of Vice-Admiral Villeneuve's fleet at Cadiz, under her captain, Charles-Eusebe l'Hôpitalier-Villemadrin. On 21 October 1805 she sailed out with the {{combined}} Franco-Spanish fleets {{to engage in the}} Battle of Trafalgar. During the battle she formed part of the rear of the line, astern of Aigle and ahead of Argonaute. She was fired upon by , and after an exchange of fire, lost her main topmast and had her guns silenced. She began to drift away, while Colossus opened fire on Bahama. Swiftsures crew regained control, and returned to fire on Colossus, but at that moment Edward Codrington's [...] came through the smoke, slipped under Swiftsure′s stern and discharged several devastating broadsides. Swiftsure had her mainmast, <b>taffrail</b> and wheel shot away, and most of the guns on the main gun-deck were dismounted. Villemadrin attempted to fight on, but eventually struck, having suffered 68 dead and 123 wounded during the battle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ship was}} named after Cutty-sark, the {{nickname}} of the witch Nannie Dee in Robert Burns's 1791 poem Tam o' Shanter. The ship's figurehead, the original {{of which has been}} attributed to carver Fredrick Hellyer of Blackwall, is a stark white carving of a bare-breasted Nannie Dee with long black hair holding a grey horse's tail in her hand. In the poem she wore a linen [...] (Scots: a short chemise or undergarment), that she had been given as a child, which explains why it was cutty, or in other words far too short. The erotic sight of her dancing in such a short undergarment caused Tam to cry out [...] " [...] done, Cutty-sark", which subsequently became a well known catchphrase. Originally, carvings by Hellyer of the other scantily clad witches followed behind the figurehead along the bow, but these were removed by Willis in deference to 'good taste'. Tam o' Shanter riding Meg was to be seen along the ship's quarter. The motto, Where there's a Willis away, was inscribed along the <b>taffrail.</b> The Tweed, which acted as a model for much of the ship which followed her, had a figurehead depicting Tam o' Shanter.|$|E

6000|$|Lashed, {{and leaning}} over {{sideways}} against the <b>taffrail,</b> were three dark, green, grassy objects, that slowly swayed with every roll, but otherwise were motionless. I saw the captain's, glass directed toward them, and {{heard him say}} at last, [...] "They must have been dead a long time." [...] These were sailors, who long ago had lashed themselves to the <b>taffrail</b> for safety; but must have famished.|$|E
60|$|Presently the {{man came}} aft, and {{reported}} that the captain was waving his hat from the <b>taffrail.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Welcome on board, Mr. Blowhard," [...] {{called out}} Captain Bilge, {{stepping}} out of the binnacle and shaking hands across the <b>taffrail.</b>|$|E

60|$|He drew nearer and {{nearer to}} her as he spoke; she, leaning against the <b>taffrail,</b> could not retreat any further from him. He laughed.|$|E
6000|$|Amazed beyond measure, {{and deeply}} chagrined, the unfortunate {{captain of the}} {{man-of-war}} turned to Gascoyne, who still sat quietly on the <b>taffrail</b> smoking his cigar-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen, then. When {{you see a}} {{white sheet}} waved over the <b>taffrail,</b> throw off your jacket and shirt and swim out to the schooner. D'ye understand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Bishop halted. She leaned {{upon the}} <b>taffrail,</b> looking out towards the {{receding}} land, {{and it was}} a moment before she answered in a steady, level voice: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If so, sir, the Comte {{begins to}} find his berth too hot for him; here is the wind still {{directly}} over our <b>taffrail,</b> such as it is." ...|$|E
60|$|The captain sprang on the <b>taffrail</b> of {{his ship}} with the {{activity}} of a younger man, and in an instant he perceived {{the truth of the}} other's conjecture.|$|E

60|$|Lord Julian stood a moment, {{watching}} the tall figure {{as it moved}} away towards the <b>taffrail.</b> Then letting his arms fall helplessly to his sides in dejection, he departed.|$|E

60|$|One day O'Riley {{sat on the}} <b>taffrail,</b> {{basking in}} the warm sun, and {{drinking}} in health and gladness from its beams. He had been ill, and was now convalescent. Buzzby stood beside him.|$|E
6000|$|And as {{we stood}} near the <b>taffrail</b> side by side, my captain and I, looking at it, hardly {{discernible}} already, but still quite close-to on our quarter, he remarked in a meditative tone: ...|$|E
6000|$|By {{the time}} Almayer had clambered {{over into the}} stern sheets, four calashes were in the boat and the oars were being passed over the <b>taffrail.</b> The mate was looking on. Suddenly he said-- ...|$|E
60|$|Striking the <b>taffrail,</b> {{the wave}} subsided, and washing {{from side to}} side, left the {{drowning}} cook high and dry on the after-hatch: his extinguished pipe still between his teeth, and almost bitten in two.|$|E

6000|$|By {{this time}} the [...] "Caroline" [...] had swept by, and she was now luffing, across the slaver's bows, into her course again. The figure on the <b>taffrail</b> waved high the sea-cap in adieu, and disappeared.|$|E
