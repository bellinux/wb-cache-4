Scores in Varsity are typically lower <b>than</b> <b>those</b> in Scholastic, and those in Scholastic are typically lower <b>than</b> <b>those</b> in Honors.|$|E

5|$|Massenet {{composed}} {{many other}} smaller-scale choral works, {{and more than}} two hundred songs. His early collections of songs were particularly popular and helped establish his reputation. His choice of lyrics ranged widely. Most were verses by poets such as Musset, Maupassant, Hugo, Gautier and many lesser-known French writers, with occasional poems from overseas, including Tennyson in English and Shelley in French translation.

5|$|The paws of the cheetah are {{narrower}} <b>than</b> <b>those</b> {{of other}} felids. The slightly curved claws lack a protective sheath and are weakly retractable (semi-retractable). This {{is a major}} point of difference between the cheetah and the big cats, which have fully retractable claws, and a similarity to canids. Additionally, the claws of the cheetah are shorter as well as straighter <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of other cats. Absence of protection makes the claws blunt; however, the large and strongly curved dewclaw is remarkably sharp.|$|E

5|$|There are {{no known}} {{morphological}} {{differences between the}} three island populations, but Turvey and colleagues found that animals from Nevis were slightly smaller <b>than</b> <b>those</b> from the two other islands.

However, Turvey and colleagues also observed that their Saint Kitts material consisted of older individuals <b>than</b> <b>those</b> from Nevis; thus, the size difference may result from differences in the mode of exploitation by Amerindians.|$|E

With the exception of sighthounds, most dogs of similar weight to coyotes have a slightly shorter stride. Coyote kills can be distinguished from wolf kills by less damage to the underlying tissues in the former. Also, coyote scat tends to be smaller than wolf scat.|$|E
