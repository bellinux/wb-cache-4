5|$|Hereditary hemorrhagic <b>telangiectasia</b> (HHT), {{also known}} as Osler–Weber–Rendu disease and Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome, is a rare {{autosomal}} dominant genetic disorder that leads to abnormal blood vessel formation in the skin, mucous membranes, and often in organs such as the lungs, liver, and brain.|$|E
5|$|Congenital {{malformation}} or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar vermis is {{a characteristic}} of both Dandy–Walker syndrome and Joubert syndrome. In very rare cases, the entire cerebellum may be absent. The inherited neurological disorders Machado–Joseph disease, ataxia <b>telangiectasia,</b> and Friedreich's ataxia cause progressive neurodegeneration linked to cerebellar loss. Congenital brain malformations outside the cerebellum can, in turn, cause herniation of cerebellar tissue, as seen in some forms of Arnold–Chiari malformation.|$|E
5|$|Checkpoint Proteins can be {{separated}} into four groups: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like protein kinase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-like group, two serine/threonine(S/T) kinases and their adaptors. Central to all DNA damage induced checkpoints responses {{is a pair}} of large protein kinases belonging to the first group of PI3K-like protein kinases-the ATM (Ataxia <b>telangiectasia</b> mutated) and ATR (Ataxia- and Rad-related) kinases, whose sequence and functions have been well conserved in evolution. All DNA damage response requires either ATM or ATR because they have the ability to bind to the chromosomes at the site of DNA damage, together with accessory proteins that are platforms on which DNA damage response components and DNA repair complexes can be assembled.|$|E
40|$|Angiogenesis {{is one of}} the {{hallmarks}} of breast cancer. The status of angiogenesis is important in therapy choice. Spider <b>telangiectasias</b> (<b>telangiectasias)</b> may reflect an increased ability to form vessels. Our first aim was to identify patient and tumor characteristics associated with the occurrence of <b>telangiectasias</b> at the time of breast cancer diagnosis. The second aim was to study the overall survival in relation to the occurrence of <b>telangiectasias</b> at the time of breast cancer diagnosis. A standardized questionnaire was used to interview 1682 consecutive breast cancer patients about risk factors between 1980 and 2009. Occurrence of <b>telangiectasias</b> at the time of breast cancer diagnosis on the upper thorax, head, and/or neck was recorded by one physician. In the cohort, 93 women (5. 5 %) had <b>telangiectasias.</b> Occurrence of <b>telangiectasias</b> was positively associated with weight, odds ratio (OR) 1. 02 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 00 - 1. 05) per kg, ever-use of oral contraceptives OR 2. 67 (CI 1. 55 - 4. 63) and hormone replacement therapy OR 2. 68 (CI 1. 63 - 4. 39), and negatively associated with parity OR 0. 45 (CI 0. 25 - 0. 79). <b>Telangiectasias</b> were not present in patients with comedo breast cancer. Patients with occurrences of <b>telangiectasias</b> diagnosed before the age of 50 had a statistically non-significant worse overall survival, whereas the patients with occurrences of <b>telangiectasias</b> diagnosed at age 50 or after had a statistically significant better overall survival (P interaction = 0. 016). The relationship between the occurrence of <b>telangiectasias</b> and the overall survival in the older patient-group was independent of ever-use of HRT. Hormonal risk factors for breast cancer were associated with the occurrence of spider <b>telangiectasias.</b> The occurrence of <b>telangiectasias</b> may reflect the angiogenic status of the tumor. We hypothesize that <b>telangiectasias</b> could be used as selection criteria for anti-angiogenic therapy in younger breast cancer patients. Therefore, patients with comedo breast cancers maybe a group that may benefit less from anti-angiogenic therapy...|$|R
50|$|Marked <b>Telangiectasias</b> (dilated capillaries) {{occur on}} {{the skin of the}} face, the palmar surface of the hands, and the mucous membranes. <b>Telangiectasias</b> tend to be more {{numerous}} in those patients with other scleroderma related vascular disease (i.e., pulmonary arterial hypertension). The number of <b>telangiectasias</b> and the sites involved tend to increase over time.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>telangiectasias</b> {{are due to}} {{developmental}} abnormalities {{that can}} closely mimic the behaviour of benign vascular neoplasms. They may be composed of abnormal aggregations of arterioles, capillaries, or venules. Because <b>telangiectasias</b> are vascular lesions, they blanch when tested with diascopy.|$|R
5|$|<b>Telangiectasia</b> (small {{vascular}} malformations) {{may occur}} in the skin and mucosal linings of the nose and gastrointestinal tract. The most common problem is nosebleeds (epistaxis), which happen frequently from childhood and affect about 90–95% of people with HHT. Lesions on the skin and in the mouth bleed less often but may be considered cosmetically displeasing; they affect about 80%. The skin lesions characteristically occur on the lips, the nose and the fingers, and on {{the skin of the}} face in sun-exposed areas. They appear suddenly, with the number increasing over time.|$|E
25|$|<b>Telangiectasia</b> (dilated blood vessels) {{over the}} white (sclera) of the eyes, making them appear bloodshot. These are not {{apparent}} in infancy and may first appear at age 5–8 years. <b>Telangiectasia</b> may also appear on sun-exposed areas of skin.|$|E
25|$|Prominent {{blood vessels}} (<b>telangiectasia)</b> {{over the white}} (sclera) of the eyes usually occur {{by the age of}} 5–8 years, but {{sometimes}} later or not at all. The absence of <b>telangiectasia</b> does not exclude the diagnosis of A-T. Potentially a cosmetic problem, the ocular <b>telangiectasia</b> do not bleed or itch, though they are sometimes misdiagnosed as chronic conjunctivitis. It is their constant nature, not changing with time, weather or emotion, that marks them as different from other visible blood vessels. <b>Telangiectasia</b> can also appear on sun-exposed areas of skin, especially the face and ears. They occur in the bladder as a late complication of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, have been seen deep inside the brain of older people with A-T, and occasionally arise in the liver and lungs.|$|E
30|$|RIFHD is a late {{complication}} of radiation therapy, which represents haemorrhagic or proliferative microangiopathies such as capillary <b>telangiectasias</b> and cavernous malformations [46]. Pathologically, <b>telangiectasias</b> and cavernous malformations differ {{only in the}} presence or absence of intervening brain parenchyma among the dilated, thin-walled vascular channels. Because these similarities and transitional forms of these vascular malformations have been observed in some patients, radiation-induced <b>telangiectasias</b> and cavernous malformations have been proposed to exist along a spectrum driven by a common proliferative pathway [47].|$|R

25|$|Many {{children}} are initially misdiagnosed as having ataxic cerebral palsy. The diagnosis of A-T {{may not be}} made until the preschool years when the neurologic symptoms of impaired gait, hand coordination, speech and eye movement appear or worsen, and the <b>telangiectasia</b> first appear. Because A-T is so rare, doctors may not {{be familiar with the}} symptoms, or methods of making a diagnosis. The late appearance of <b>telangiectasia</b> may be a barrier to the diagnosis. It may take some time before doctors consider A-T as a possibility because of the early stability of symptoms and signs.|$|E
25|$|Non-infectious {{diseases}} {{that may result}} in symptoms {{similar to those of}} EVD include acute promyelocytic leukemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, snake envenomation, clotting factor deficiencies/platelet disorders, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hereditary hemorrhagic <b>telangiectasia,</b> Kawasaki disease, and warfarin poisoning.|$|E
25|$|A {{validated}} comprehensive grading {{scale has}} categorized the clinical findings of skin aging as laxity (sagging), rhytids (wrinkles), {{and the various}} facets of photoaging, including erythema (redness), and <b>telangiectasia,</b> dyspigmentation (brown discoloration), solar elastosis (yellowing), keratoses (abnormal growths) and poor texture.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Sclerotherapy of <b>telangiectasias</b> and reticular leg veins can be {{unpleasant}} {{and painful}} for some patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine pain level with two different sclerotherapy techniques in a prospective randomized trial. METHODS: Patients with symmetrical <b>telangiectasias</b> and reticular veins on both legs (C(1 A) or (S) E(P) A(S) P(N 1) were randomized {{to the standard}} (successive injections of chromated glycerin mixed with one-third lidocaine-epinephrine 1 %) or two-step technique (first treating only reticular veins with a single injection {{at the base of}} each cluster of <b>telangiectasias</b> and then successively injecting all remaining <b>telangiectasias</b> a few minutes later. Pain was assessed using a 100 -point visual analogue scale (0 = no pain, 100 = maximum pain). RESULTS: Data from 53 consecutive patients could be evaluated. The two-step technique was significantly less painful (28. 2) than the standard technique (40. 6, p <. 001). CONCLUSION: The two-step technique with chromated glycerin mixed with one-third lidocaine-epinephrine 1 % significantly reduces sclerotherapy pain. This may be a useful technique for patients who are particularly sensitive or afraid of sclerotherapy...|$|R

25|$|Part of the {{hereditary}} non-BRCA1 and non-BRCA2 breast tumors may {{be associated}} to rare syndromes, of which breast cancer is only one component. Such syndromes result notably from mutations in TP53 (Li-Fraumeni syndrome), ATM (Ataxia <b>Telangiectasia),</b> STK11/LKB1(Peutz-Jeghers syndrome), PTEN (Cowden syndrome).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these three conditions, several other human syndromes, that also have defective DNA repair, show several features of premature aging. These include ataxia <b>telangiectasia,</b> Nijmegen breakage syndrome, some subgroups of xeroderma pigmentosum, trichothiodystrophy, Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT or A-T), also {{referred}} to as ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome or Louis–Bar syndrome, is a rare, neurodegenerative, autosomal recessive disease causing severe disability. Ataxia refers to poor coordination and <b>telangiectasia</b> to small dilated blood vessels, both of which are hallmarks of the disease.|$|E

5|$|<b>Telangiectasias</b> and {{arteriovenous}} malformations in HHT {{are thought}} to arise because of changes in angiogenesis, the development of blood vessels out of existing ones.

The exact mechanism by which the HHT mutations influence this process is not yet clear, and it is likely that they disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signals in blood vessels. The wall of <b>telangiectasias</b> is unusually friable, which explains the tendency of these lesions to bleed.|$|R
