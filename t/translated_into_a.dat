This estimate seemed achievable because Chrysler had a 7percent market share in Europe overall. The projected sales would have covered the car's tooling costs, with the development costs accounted for separately, as part of an independent annual budget.|$|E

5|$|Many other {{cellular}} automata {{and other}} computational systems {{are capable of}} emulating the behavior of Rule 90. For instance, a configuration in rule 90 may be <b>translated</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> configuration into the different elementary cellular automaton Rule 22. The translation replaces each Rule 90 cell by three consecutive Rule 22 cells. These cells are all zero if the Rule 90 cell is itself zero. A nonzero Rule 90 cell is <b>translated</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> one followed by two zeros. With this transformation, every six steps of the Rule 22 automaton simulate a single step of the Rule 90 automaton. Similar direct simulations of Rule 90 are also possible for the elementary cellular automata Rule 45 and Rule 126, for certain string rewriting systems and tag systems, and in some two-dimensional cellular automata including Wireworld. Rule 90 can also simulate itself in the same way. If each cell of a Rule 90 configuration {{is replaced by a}} pair of consecutive cells, the first containing the original cell's value and the second containing zero, then this doubled configuration has the same behavior as the original configuration at half the speed.|$|E

Coatbridge born Dame Laurentia McLachlan was the Benedictine abbess of the Stanbrook Community whose correspondence with George Bernard Shaw and Sydney Cockerell was the subject of the film The Best of Friends.|$|E

The Tale of Peter Rabbit {{was the first of}} the small format books to be <b>translated</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> non-English language when Het Verhaal van Pieter Langoor was published in 1912 by Nijgh & Ditmar's Uitgevers Maatschappij, Rotterdam. Peter Rabbit has since been published in braille (1921), in the International Phonetic Alphabet (1968), and in the hieroglyphic script of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (2005).|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} small ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules– microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)– {{are central to}} RNA interference. RNAs are the direct {{products}} of genes, and these small RNAs can bind to other specific messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules and either increase or decrease their activity, for example by preventing an mRNA from being <b>translated</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> protein. RNA interference has {{an important role in}} defending cells against parasitic nucleotide sequences– viruses and transposons. It also influences development.|$|E

Sanchez played {{relatively}} well, avoiding a 3-and-out on the first drive with a 5-yard scramble and managing {{to tie the game}} 7-7 with a touchdown pass to Brent Celek, but a defensive meltdown and lack of offensive momentum left the Eagles hopeless, and Sanchez finished his Eagles record with an 0-2 record as starter. Sanchez finished 19/27 for 199 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions, which <b>translated</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> passer rating of 116.1.|$|E

5|$|The main Nancy Drew series, The Nancy Drew Files, and Girl Detective {{books have}} been <b>translated</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> number of {{languages}} besides English. Estimates vary from between 14 and 25languages, but 25 seems the most accurate number. Nancy Drew {{books have been}} published in many European countries (especially in Nordic countries and France) as well as in Latin America and Asia. The character of Nancy Drew seems to be more popular in some countries than others. Nancy Drew books have been in print in Norway since 1941 (the first country outside USA), in Denmark since 1958, in France since 1955 and in Italy since 1970 by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore. Other countries, such as Estonia, have only recently begun printing Nancy Drew books.|$|E
5|$|A Wizard of Earthsea {{was first}} {{published}} in 1968 by Parnassus Press in Berkeley, a year before The Left Hand of Darkness, Le Guin's watershed work. It was a personal landmark for Le Guin, as it represented her first attempt at writing for children; she had written only a handful of other novels and short stories prior to its publication. The book was also her first attempt at writing fantasy, rather than science-fiction. A Wizard of Earthsea was the first of Le Guin's books to receive widespread critical attention, and has been described as her best known work, as part of the Earthsea series. The book has been released in numerous editions, including an illustrated Folio Society edition released in 2015. It was also <b>translated</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> number of other languages. An omnibus edition of all of Le Guin's Earthsea works is planned to be released on the 50th anniversary of the publication of A Wizard of Earthsea in 2018.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the 22-officer Dawson Creek Royal Canadian Mounted Police {{municipal}} detachment reported 2,561 Criminal Code offences. This <b>translated</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> {{crime rate}} of 225 Criminal Code offences per 1,000 people, {{down from the}} previous year's rate of 231, but still {{much higher than the}} provincial average of 125. In 2004, per 1,000 people, the city had higher crime rates compared to the provincial averages on all Criminal Code offences except theft from motor vehicles (19.8 city, 20.2 province), heroin-related offences (0 city, 0.13 province), and murder (0 city, 0.03 province). The city had slightly higher but comparable levels of offensive weapons charges, cannabis-related offences, robbery, and motor vehicle thefts. Per 1,000 people, the city had much higher levels of shoplifting (13.8 city, 4.2 province), cocaine-related offences (7.8 city, 1.4 province), commercial break-and-enters (11.2 city, 4.2 province), residential break-and-enters (13.9 city, 6.0 province), and non-sexual assaults (26.2 city, 9.9 province).|$|E
5|$|In {{the electoral}} college, {{the vote was}} more decisive. As expected, Hancock carried the South and border states, but Garfield swept {{all but one of}} the Northern states (the {{exception}} was New Jersey, which he lost by just two thousand votes). Both candidates carried nineteen states, but Garfield’s triumphs in the more populous North <b>translated</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> 214–155 electoral college victory. The sectional divide of the vote more deeply enforced the Republicans' retreat from the South after Reconstruction, and demonstrated that they could win without competing there. Weaver's resistance to fusion had no effect on the result; the combined Democratic and Greenback vote would have carried Indiana, but not any other of the states Garfield won, and the result would still have been a Republican majority in the electoral college. Hancock was convinced that the Republicans won New York by fraud. Lacking evidence, and mindful of the turmoil caused by the disputed election four years earlier, the Democrats did not pursue the matter.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{stood against}} this measure, {{as he had}} against nearly all Reconstruction laws. A lack of {{consensus}} delayed the bill from coming to a vote until the lame-duck session beginning in December 1874. By that time, disillusionment with the Grant administration and worsening economic conditions had <b>translated</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Democratic victory in the mid-term elections. When the 44th Congress gathered in March 1875, the House would have a Democratic majority {{for the first time}} since the Civil War. In the meantime, the outgoing Republicans made one last effort to pass Sumner's civil rights bill; Randall and other Democrats immediately used parliamentary maneuvers to bring action to a stand-still, hoping to delay passage until the Congress ended. Randall led his caucus in filibustering the bill, at one point remaining on the floor for 72 hours. In the end, the Democrats peeled away some Republican votes, but not enough to defeat the bill, which passed by a vote of 162 to 100. Despite the defeat, Randall's filibuster increased his prominence in the eyes of his Democratic colleagues.|$|E
