On the Røros Line, the trains are used both on the Hamar–Røros and the Røros–Trondheim section. On the Nordland Line, the Class 93 serves both the Ole Tobias service between Trondheim and Mo i Rana. The unit was considered for use on the Meråker Line as well, but this has continued to be operated by Class 92 units. The initial plan was that eight of the eleven units were needed for daily operations. Four on the Røros Line, two on the Nordland Line and two on the Rauma Line. The additional four units were needed for operating the Trondheim–Bodø trains on the Nordland Line, of which three would be used at any one time. Double units (four cars) are sometimes operated on the Trondheim – Mo i Rana train, as are the Friday and Sunday afternoon trains on the Rauma Line, for exchange of equipment, and to handle the increased traffic on <b>these</b> <b>days.</b> <b>In</b> addition, NSB uses the trains on the commuter services Bodø–Fauske–Rognan and Mo i Rana–Mosjøen.|$|E
