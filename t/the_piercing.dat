5|$|Physical trauma {{including}} tearing, friction or bumping of <b>the</b> <b>piercing</b> site, {{which may}} cause edema and delay healing. The risks can be minimized by wearing properly sized jewellery and not changing it unnecessarily, by not touching <b>the</b> <b>piercing</b> more than required for aftercare, and by being conscious of environmental factors (such as clothing) that may impact <b>the</b> <b>piercing.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{indwelling}} cannula: Outside of the United States, many piercers use {{a needle}} containing a cannula (or catheter), a hollow plastic tube {{placed at the}} end of the needle. In some countries, <b>the</b> <b>piercing</b> needle favoured in the United States is regarded as a medical device and is illegal for body piercers. The procedure is similar to <b>the</b> <b>piercing</b> needle method, but the initial jewellery is inserted into the back of the cannula and the cannula and the jewellery are then pulled through <b>the</b> <b>piercing.</b> More bleeding may follow, as <b>the</b> <b>piercing</b> is larger than the jewellery.|$|E

5|$|The {{growth or}} proliferative phase, {{during which the}} body {{produces}} cells and protein to heal the puncture and the edges contract around <b>the</b> <b>piercing,</b> forming a tunnel of scar tissue called a fistula. This phase may last weeks, months, or longer than a year.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>piercing</b> needle: The {{standard}} method in the United States involves making an opening using a beveled-tip hollow medical needle, {{which is available}} in different lengths, gauges and even shapes. While straight needles are useful for many body parts, curved needles are manufactured for areas where straight needles are not ideal. The needle selected is typically the same gauge (or sometimes larger as with cartilage piercings) as the initial jewellery to be worn, with higher gauges indicating thinner needles. The needle is inserted into the body part being pierced, frequently by hand but sometimes {{with the aid of}} a needle holder or pusher. While the needle is still in the body, the initial jewellery to be worn in <b>the</b> <b>piercing</b> is pushed through the opening, following the back of the needle. Jewellery is often inserted into the hollow end of a needle, so that as the needle pulls through the jewellery is left behind.|$|E

5|$|Needle {{receiving}} tubes: A hollow tube made of metal, shatter-resistant {{glass or}} plastic, needle receiving tubes, like forceps, {{are used to}} support the tissue at <b>the</b> <b>piercing</b> site and are common in septum and some cartilage piercings. Not only are these tubes intended to support the tissue, but they also receive the needle once it has passed through the tissue, offering protection from the sharp point. Needle receiving tubes are not used in the freehand piercing method.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} time it {{typically}} takes a piercing to heal varies widely according to the placement of <b>the</b> <b>piercing.</b> Genital piercings can be among the quicker to heal, with piercings of the clitoral hood and Prince Albert piercings healing in as little as a month, though some may take longer. Navel piercings can be the slowest to heal, with one source reporting a range of six months to two full years. The prolonged healing of navel piercings may be connected to clothing friction.|$|E

40|$|The {{interest}} in tiny wireless applications raises {{the demand for}} an integrated reference oscillator with the same performance as the macroscopic quartz crystal reference oscillators. The main challenge of the thesis is {{to prove that it}} is possible to build a MEMS based oscillator that approaches the accuracy level of existing quartz crystal oscillators. The MEMS resonator samples which Philips provides are measured and an equivalent electrical model is designed for them. This model is used in the simulations of <b>the</b> <b>Pierce</b> oscillator and <b>the</b> transresistance amplifier oscillator that are evaluated in this thesis. Finally <b>the</b> <b>Pierce</b> oscillator is implemented in the A BCD 2 process and manufactured at Philips Semiconductors in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. A test board, for measuring <b>the</b> <b>Pierce</b> oscillator together with a MEMS resonator or a quartz crystal resonator, is built. <b>The</b> <b>Pierce</b> oscillator is then measured with a quartz crystal resonator. In order to simulate the higher series resistance of the MEMS resonators a resistor is put in series with the quartz crystal. <b>The</b> <b>Pierce</b> oscillator is working with a series resistance of 1 kΩ. With higher series resistance <b>the</b> <b>Pierce</b> oscillator stops working. In circuit simulations <b>the</b> <b>Pierce</b> oscillator is working with a series resistance of about 5 kΩ in the MEMS resonator model. To be sure whether <b>the</b> <b>Pierce</b> oscillator has enough gain for the MEMS resonators, it needs to be measured with them. Temperature variations in the MEMS resonators need to be handled and the phase noise performance of the oscillator must be improved, in order for the MEMS based reference oscillator to be a successful replacement for the quartz crystal reference oscillator...|$|R

5|$|Body {{adornment}} {{has only}} recently become a subject of serious scholarly research by archaeologists, who have been hampered in studying body piercing by a sparsity of primary sources. Early records rarely discussed the use of piercings or their meaning, and while jewellery is common among grave goods, {{the deterioration of the}} flesh that it once adorned makes it difficult to discern how the jewellery may have been used. Also, the modern record has been vitiated with the 20th-century inventions of piercing enthusiast Doug Malloy. In the 1960s and 1970s, Malloy marketed contemporary body piercing by giving it the patina of history. His pamphlet Body & Genital Piercing in Brief included such commonly reproduced urban legends as the notion that Prince Albert invented <b>the</b> <b>piercing</b> that shares his name in order to diminish the appearance of his large penis in tight trousers, and that Roman centurions attached their capes to nipple piercings. Some of Malloy's myths are reprinted as fact in subsequently published histories of piercing.|$|E

50|$|George N. <b>Pierce,</b> {{owner of}} <b>the</b> GN <b>Pierce</b> Co, built {{refrigerators}} and bird cages in the 1890s, and expanded into bicycle manufacture by 1892, with their famous 'arrow' logo; {{many of their}} bicycles used a shaft drive for the rear wheel. 3 members of <b>the</b> GN <b>Pierce</b> Board of Directors traveled to Europe in 1900, to acquire new technology, and purchased a DeDion engine to power a new automobile, <b>the</b> <b>Pierce's</b> son Percy was a competition driver of Pierce Motor Car Co automobiles, and by 1907 he was appointed head of <b>the</b> new <b>Pierce</b> Cycle Co, {{with the intention of}} producing motorcycles. Following factory tradition, he traveled to Europe for technical inspiration, and acquired a Belgian FN Four in 1908, which was shipped back to <b>the</b> <b>Pierce</b> factory for study. As the world's first production four-cylinder motorcycle, the FN was the apex of current technology, and <b>the</b> <b>Pierce</b> engineering team used the FN as a reference for their own four-cylinder motorcycle introduced in 1909; <b>the</b> <b>Pierce</b> Four. <b>The</b> new <b>Pierce</b> was innovative, with a stressed member engine and shaft drive, and a frame of very large-diameter tubing, that both hid the control cables and held oil and gasoline internally. The large diameter tubing is said to have increased the frame's strength, and reduced the number of parts required, making manufacture less expensive. Unlike FN's engine, <b>the</b> <b>Pierce</b> had a T-head sidevalve motor, and cam-driven intake valves rather than the 'automatic' (opened by atmospheric pressure) inlet valves of <b>the</b> FN. <b>The</b> <b>Pierce</b> was thus quite an improvement on the FN, and was the first four-cylinder motorcycle manufactured in the USA. Early models had no clutch and fixed gearing, like the competing FN Four, but the 1910 model was greatly improved, with a clutch and two-speed transmission.|$|R

25|$|A long-standing home method {{involves}} using ice {{as a local}} anesthetic, {{a sewing}} needle as a puncture instrument, a burning match and rubbing alcohol for disinfection, and a semi-soft object, such as a potato, cork, bar of soap or rubber eraser, as a push point. Sewing thread may be drawn through <b>the</b> <b>piercing</b> and tied, as a device for keeping <b>the</b> <b>piercing</b> open during the healing process. Alternatively, a gold stud or wire earring may be directly inserted into the fresh piercing as the initial retaining device.

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{which is}} growing in practice {{is the use of}} a hollow piercing needle, as is done in body piercing. The piercer disinfects the earlobe with alcohol and puts a mark on the lobe with a pen. It gives the opportunity to the client to check whether the position is correct or not. Then, the piercer uses a clamp with flat ends and holes at the end to hold the earlobe, with the dot {{in the middle of the}} holes. This device will support the skin during <b>the</b> <b>piercing</b> process. A cork can be placed behind the earlobe to stop the movement of the needle after <b>the</b> <b>piercing</b> process, and protect the tip of the needle for the client's comfort. Then, the piercer places the hollow needle perpendicular to the skin's surface and check the position of the needle, to pierce at the desired place and the right angle. <b>The</b> <b>piercing</b> process consists of pushing the needle through the earlobe, until it gets out in the other side. The client has to remain still during all the process. Then, the clamp can be put off. After that, the piercer puts the jewel in the hollow needle and pushes the needle through until the jewel enters into the lobe. Then, the needle is removed and disposed properly. The jewel is attached to the lobe and the piercer disinfects the lobe again.|$|E
