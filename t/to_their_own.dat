5|$|In 2009, Newsom {{came under}} attack for the City of San Francisco's policy of {{illegally}} harboring juvenile criminal aliens.

5|$|Many stories tell of fox-wives bearing children.

The astrologer-magician Abe no Seimei was reputed to have inherited such extraordinary powers.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} {{significant}} parliamentary representation for the burgher class, and none for the peasants. The Jewish communities sent representatives <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> Va'ad, or Council of Four Lands. The narrow social {{base of the}} Commonwealth's parliamentary system was detrimental to its future development {{and the future of}} the Polish–Lithuanian statehood.|$|E

5|$|After Mr. Garrison gets a nose job, {{his face}} {{resembles that of}} David Hasselhoff, the actor and singer {{best known for the}} series Knight Rider and Baywatch. Mr. Garrison refers disparagingly to the 1997 science fiction drama film Contact.

5|$|After North-Beveland had {{surrendered}} on 18 May, Zeeuws-Vlaanderen was {{the last}} remaining unoccupied Dutch homeland territory. On orders of the French, all Dutch troops were withdrawn on 19 May to Ostend in Belgium, as their presence would be demoralising and confusing <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> forces. On 27 May all of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen had been occupied.|$|E
5|$|Although most printed sources, Harvey (1903), Olszewski (1971), Torres (1984), and the Historic Structure Report (2004), {{refer to}} the {{original}} 1884 inscriptions, the National Geodetic Survey (2015) refers to both the 1884 and 1934 inscriptions. All sources print them according <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> editorial rules, resulting in excessive capitalization (Harvey, Olszewski, and NGS) and inappropriate line breaks. No printed source uses cursive writing, although pictures of the apex clearly show that it was used for both the 1884 and 1934 inscriptions.|$|E

5|$|Another {{conflicting}} issue between Darejan and her reigning step-son was Georgia's {{relations with}} the Russian Empire. Darejan had been skeptical of Georgia's rapprochement with its northern neighbour already in Heraclius's lifetime, especially after the Russians, bound by the 1783 treaty of Georgievsk to protect Heraclius's kingdom from external threat, had left the Georgians <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> devices {{in the face of}} a disastrous invasion from Iran in 1795. The queen had repeatedly maintained that the relationship with Russia had brought no benefit to Georgia.|$|E

5|$|By 1675 George's eldest {{uncle had}} died without issue, but his {{remaining}} two uncles had married, putting George's inheritance in jeopardy as his uncles' estates might pass <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> sons, {{should they have}} had any, instead of to George. George's father took him hunting and riding, and introduced him to military matters; mindful of his uncertain future, Ernest Augustus took the fifteen-year-old George on campaign in the Franco-Dutch War with the deliberate purpose of testing and training his son in battle.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{only those}} wishing to use {{specialised}} material unavailable in other public or academic libraries {{would be given}} a Reader Pass.
