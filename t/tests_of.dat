40|$|Purpose: In this study, {{in order}} to {{determine}} basketball ability levels of 8 - 10 years old girls and boys, we aimed to develop ability test battery for basketball and study its reliability and validity. Methodology: 91 fourth grade students (52 girls and 39 boys) studying at Akyurt Elementary School in Ankara participated in this study in 2006 - 2007. The test battery used in the study is composed of six sub-sections: a <b>test</b> <b>of</b> throwing a ball into a hoop from the air (shooting), a <b>test</b> <b>of</b> throwing a bouncing ball into a hoop (bounce shooting), a <b>test</b> <b>of</b> dribbling, a <b>test</b> <b>of</b> bringing down pins (bowling), a <b>test</b> <b>of</b> throwing a ball to a target on a wall (passing to the target), and a <b>test</b> <b>of</b> fast passing on a wall (speed pass). “Content validity methodology” was used in examining validity <b>of</b> <b>test</b> battery and “Cronbach Alfa” coefficient was used in analyzing the reliability. Results: In the study, reliability coefficient for the whole basketball ability test battery was found to be α= 0. 76. Reliability coefficients of each sections <b>of</b> the <b>test</b> battery were found as α= 0. 70 for the <b>test</b> <b>of</b> throwing a ball into a hoop from the air, α= 0. 67 for the <b>test</b> <b>of</b> throwing a bouncing ball into a hoop, α= 0. 95 for the <b>test</b> <b>of</b> dribbling, α= 0. 74 for the a <b>test</b> <b>of</b> bringing down pins, α= 0. 80 for the <b>test</b> <b>of</b> throwing a ball to a target on a wall, and α= 0. 89 for the <b>test</b> <b>of</b> fast passing on a wall. Conclusion: The data collected in our study suggest that basketball ability test applied to this age group can be used validly and reliably. We believe that the exercises in the test battery will help predicting the children’s basketball ability levels and will make contribution to ability selection efforts...|$|R
