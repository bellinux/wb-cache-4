Odd is now left with responsibility for Sissener's dog and with an urgency <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>life</b> to the fullest. He makes {{his way up to}} the Holmenkollen ski jump, where he sees a vision of his mother as a young woman, doing the jump. He comes to a decision and starts to do the ski jump. Odd, for the first time no longer wearing his railwayman's jacket, rides the train to Bergen, where Svea is happily waiting for him on the platform.|$|E
5|$|At midnight, Homer quietly {{gets out}} of bed, visits each family member, who are all asleep, and says goodbye. Feeling glum, {{he goes to the}} living room and listens to Larry King read the Bible on tape. The tape plays out to which {{suddenly}} his head drops and it appears he has succumbed to the poison. Marge awakens the next morning and is panicked that her husband is not by her side. She runs downstairs and finds Homer, collapsed in the armchair. As she mourns, she realizes that his drool is still warm. She wakes him up and drums in {{the fact that he is}} alive and had not been poisoned after all. Homer then prances around in an overjoyed state and vows <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>life</b> to its fullest. Back to living his normal life, Homer returns to the couch watching a bowling tournament and eating pork rinds.|$|E

He had his father's eye for women, and in 1920 met Mrs. Richard Peabody (née Mary Phelps Jacob), six years his senior. They had sex within two weeks, and their open affair was the source of scandal and gossip among blue-blood Boston.|$|E

When he wants to start drinking martinis, Francine objects since he cannot handle his alcohol.

Francine then disbars the arrangement, but Stan decides to get drunk again, causing him to pass out repeatedly and believe that Francine is a witch.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle {{taught that}} {{to achieve a}} virtuous and {{potentially}} happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses {{to do the best}} things. When the best people come <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>life</b> this way their practical wisdom (phronesis) and their intellect (nous) can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Tancred enlisted in the Natal Light Horse but was discharged as being unfit for active service in 1915. His marriage to Mary Chawick later that year produced two children and following a few post War matches Tancred retired from first-class cricket in 1920. It is believed that Tancred became depressed as he struggled <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>life</b> out of the limelight that surrounded his cricketing career. His disillusionment was such that Tancred strongly advised his son Louis Jnr not {{to embark on a}} career in sport. Louis Jnr instead joined the Royal Air Force and, while working as a flight instructor, was killed aged 34 in a plane crash at the Isle of Axholme, Lincolnshire.|$|E

25|$|J.P. {{embraced the}} {{philosophy}} put forth in Jan Yoor’s book, “The Gypsies.” That philosophy of total freedom of actions, of non-ownership of possessions, defined {{his adult life}} and was far more revolutionary than most people could deal with. His incredible generosity (he would give the shirt off his back if he saw the need, and did so frequently), his deep love for his family and friends, the heart-felt music he composed and played as naturally as he breathed, all speak of a man committed to his desire <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>life</b> fully and without restraints. J.P. had a rascally sense of humor, though; another story he loved to tell was of the Romany Gypsy family that lived in the flat above the Pickens in San Francisco in early 1963. The father of the family would {{go out at night}} with a crowbar and smash fenders on cars parked along the street, then come along the next morning to offer to do the bodywork repairs. J.P. thought this was hilarious and told the story often with great relish.|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} album in Europe, Kiedis and Frusciante both agreed {{they would make}} the trip. However, it proved {{difficult}} for Frusciante to adapt to life outside of the mansion, after being in near-seclusion for almost 30 days. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "He had such an outpouring of creativity while we were making that album that I think he really didn't know how <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>life</b> in tandem with that creativity." [...] It was also during this period when Frusciante began to experiment with heroin, which further compromised his mental stability. The European promotional trek took its toll on Frusciante, {{and he decided to}} return home when he and Kiedis reached London.|$|E
500|$|The McGuinn and Hillman {{composition}} [...] "Change Is Now", {{with its}} lyrics advising the listener <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>life</b> to the full, represents {{a celebration of}} the philosophy of carpe diem (popularly translated as [...] "seize the day"). Within this context, the song's lyrics explored a number of other themes, including epiphenomenalism, communalism and human ecology. The quasi-philosophical nature of the song prompted McGuinn to flippantly describe it in a 1969 interview as [...] "another one of those guru-spiritual-mystic songs that no-one understood." [...] An early instrumental recording of the song, listed under its original working title of [...] "Universal Mind Decoder", was included as a bonus track on the 1997 reissue of The Notorious Byrd Brothers. [...] "Change Is Now" [...] is notable for being the only song on the album to feature both David Crosby and future Byrd Clarence White together on the same track.|$|E

500|$|Although {{things seemed}} {{to start off}} smoothly, when {{construction}} began on the bridge in 1834, things went downhill. The bridge was constructed fast, and when completed {{in the spring of}} 1836, it was a wooden covered bridge at a length of [...] Within days of opening the bridge, on April 9, 1836, a storm blew through the valley, destroying two of the bridges three piers and rendered the new bridge unusable. After restarting construction later, the bridge was redone using the same piers and in 1839, was completed and opened once again. However, in January 1841, another storm, dubbed the Bridges Freshet of January 1841, blew through the valley, destroying most of the bridges in the area, and causing major damage to the structure from Riverton to Belvidere. However, this time, the bridge survived the storm. A local historian stated that because of the constant repairwork on the bridge itself, the bridge company had never paid one dividend of money to its stockholders. Although, after society {{on both sides of the}} bridge began <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>life</b> with it, money started flowing into the accounts of the stockholders.|$|E
500|$|Other {{tracks were}} noted for their retro stylization. [...] "Rather Die Young" [...] is {{a throwback to}} 1960s doo-wop and Philadelphia soul, with a slow tempo and modern drums. [...] "Party" [...] {{achieves}} a vintage aesthetic through minimalistic production, replete with heavy synthesizers and a 1980s smooth-funk groove. The song is unique for its conversation-like structure, in which Beyoncé and guest-vocalist André 3000 sing verses that allude to socialization at parties. Elements of Prince's style was found on [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] and [...] "I Care". [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] is an uptempo funk song, with lyrics that advise the listener <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>life</b> to the fullest while cautioning them {{about the consequences of}} excess. The chorus of [...] "I Care" [...] was compared to [...] "Purple Rain", with themes of sadness and resentment, the song uses soft background vocals and dense percussion. [...] "Love on Top" [...] was noted for its energetic key changes with a joyful tone, evoking the work of Michael and Janet Jackson. Its retro sound is marked by a melding of horns as well as sweet backing harmonies that are most prominent on its bridge and chorus.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{the rest}} of the office get into a heated debate over whether actress Hilary Swank can be {{considered}} [...] "hot". Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) leads the group voting she is not hot, claiming she looks like a [...] "monster". Jim temporarily convinces Kevin to switch sides by having him imagine Hilary kissing him, only for Kevin to switch back, saying the debate is whether she is hot, not whether he would have sex with her. Angela (Angela Kinsey) resists the debate, but eventually votes [...] "hot" [...] after getting offended by Kevin's crude remarks. Kelly (Mindy Kaling), who believes herself less attractive than Swank, gets emotional when Toby (Paul Lieberstein) defends his [...] "not hot" [...] vote. Pam (Jenna Fischer) argues they should not let the Kevins of the world decide who is hot, or decide anything at all. Oscar (Oscar Nuñez) gives a detailed overhead presentation about the structure of Swank's facial features, concluding she is [...] "attractive...not hot." [...] An uncharacteristically uplifting Stanley (Leslie David Baker) votes hot, claiming pointing out flaws is no way <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>life.</b> At the end of the debate, the sides are still tied until Michael, oblivious of their debate, passes by the pictures on the wall and casually calls her hot.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after Hazumu's transformation, she is unsure on how <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>life</b> as a {{girl and}} is {{initially}} very clueless about typical female matters. Hazumu is also confused about how different people treat her after the change, though Hazumu resigns herself <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>life</b> {{as a girl}}. Despite Hazumu's physical change, {{there is not much}} change in her personality, as she still scares very easily, and has always been rather effusive, expressive and quite sensitive, which makes her fit well as a girl after the change. She has always been quite indecisive, which causes problems in the course of her changing relationship with both Yasuna and Tomari. Hazumu ends up becoming more feminine as time goes on, which is shown through her actions, mannerisms and personality. One exception to this, however, is that she never gets over referring to herself using the term , meaning [...] "I", which is usually only used by males in Japan. Hazumu is very selfless, thinking of others before herself and worries about her friends greatly. Yasuna has observed that Hazumu only smiles greatest when she is surrounded by her many loved ones.|$|E

2500|$|Arnim's and Brentano's {{anthology}} Des Knaben Wunderhorn: Alte deutsche Lieder, {{a collection}} of songs about love, soldiers, wandering, as well as children's songs, was an important source for the Romantic movement.

Attune your senses finely to recognize the sensuous touches of nature. Winter flowers are not fragrant, but there is a smell to them. Identify it. Only as you become finely-honed and centered {{will you be able to}} sense and use the presence of earth energy or that of other elements. The more you sensitize yourself, the more Nature reveals her secrets." ...|$|E
