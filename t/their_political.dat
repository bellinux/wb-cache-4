The VNQDD remains respected among some sections of the overseas Vietnamese community as Vietnam's leading anti-communist organisation.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, in {{accordance}} with the political strategy, Minh's junta was reluctant to carry out large-scale offensives, which concerned the Americans, particularly Harkins, Taylor and CIA chief John McCone. While Harkins and Taylor had opposed Diệm's ouster, the junta's policies also disappointed many supporters of the anti-Diệm coup as they saw regime change as necessary to their hopes of a more aggressive anti-communist war. For their part, Minh's leadership group believed that a more low-key military approach was needed for <b>their</b> <b>political</b> campaign against the insurgency.|$|E
5|$|During the pre-modern era early {{forms of}} {{globalization}} were {{already beginning to}} affect a world system, marking a period that historian A. G. Hopkins has called archaic globalization.

5|$|In {{response}} to communist witch-hunts, many witnesses and employees {{chose to use}} the fifth amendment protection against self-incrimination to avoid divulging information about <b>their</b> <b>political</b> beliefs.
