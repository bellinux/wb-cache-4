[...] Alleging that Wilson was interested in more than just stopping the raids. Wilson responded to Carranza by voicing his concerns, saying; [...] "for three years the Mexican Republic has been torn with Civil strife; the lives of Americans and other aliens have been sacrificed; vast properties developed by American capital and enterprise have been destroyed or rendered nonproductive; bandits raiders have been permitted to roam through the territory contiguous to the United States and to seize, without punishment or effective attempt at punishment, the property of Americans." ...|$|E
40|$|In 1944, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt {{signed the}} {{original}} GI Bill, ensuring that eight million combat veterans {{coming home from}} Germany and Japan {{would be able to}} afford an education. Called the "Servicemen's Readjustment Act," the World War II GI Bill covered tuition, fees, and books, and gave veterans a living stipend while they were in school. Presidents Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush, Senators Bob Dole and Patrick Moynihan, and authors Norman Mailer and Frank McCourt all relied on the GI Bill. Experts have argued that the GI Bill "reinvented America" after a half-decade of war. Indeed, a 1988 Congressional study showed that every dollar spent on educational benefits under the original GI Bill added seven dollars to the national economy in terms of productivity, consumer spending and tax revenue. But in his signing statement, President Roosevelt spoke more simply: "[The GI Bill] gives emphatic notice to {{the men and women in}} our armed forces that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not intend to let them down. " Today, 1. 5 million troops are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan to a very different future than the one FDR made possible for the Greatest Generation. The current educational benefits offered to veterans are far lower than the original GI Bill. Today, after paying a nonrefundable contribution from their first military paychecks, troops can receive a total of up to $ 39, 600 towards their education. Unfortunately, this covers only 60 - 70 % of the average cost of four years at a public college or university, or less than two years at a typical private college. In addition, structural problems and bureaucratic delays discourage veterans from using their GI Bill benefits. National Guardsmen and Reservists, including those who have served multiple combat tours, typically receive only a fraction of their GI Bill benefits. Moreover, 30 % of troops who pay the nonrefundable $ 1, 200 contribution do not end up using the GI Bill at all. These veterans have paid the government $ 230 million, but received nothing in return. Today's veterans deserve a real reintegration program to help adjust to the civilian world. At the same time, a renewed GI Bill is a practical answer to the military's troop shortage. Despite investing $ 4 billion dollars in recruiting annually, the military has had serious problems recruiting high-caliber personnel. The Pentagon has responded by lowering age, education, and aptitude standards for new recruits, as well as upping the number of recruiters and increasing enlistment bonuses. These stop-gap measures will not address long-term problems with recruiting, especially as the overall size of the Armed Forces is expanded. Rather than continuing to spend billions in bonuses for lower-standard enlistees, increasing GI Bill benefits would encourage high-aptitude young people to join the military. The GI Bill is the military's single most effective recruitment tool; the number one reason civilians join the military is to get money for college. As our military recovers and resets in the coming years, an expanded GI Bill will play a crucial role in ensuring that our military remains the strongest and most advanced in the world...|$|E

40|$|Can {{a sitting}} President ever be criminally prosecuted (outside an {{impeachment}} court) ?

Although the long pedigree ofthis debate suggests that reasonable people can disagree, {{we believe that the}} best view ofconstitutional text, history, structure, and precedent supports the conclusion that Justice Story reached: Sitting Presidents cannot be prosecuted. This privilege does not place Presidents above the law; they can be held accountable for their actions after they leave office, and they can be impeached to hasten this. The privilege does not make Presidents imperial; their special status is ultimately traceable to the rights of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>People.</b> Nor <b>does</b> <b>the</b> privilege clash with <b>the</b> structure of <b>American</b> constitutional government; <b>the</b> President is constitutionally distinct from other, prosecutable officials...|$|R

50|$|The bias {{blind spot}} is the {{cognitive}} bias of recognizing {{the impact of}} biases on the judgement of others, while failing to see the impact of biases on one's own judgment.

American airmen tried to demonstrate what air power was capable of, but the response to their achievements never met their expectations. Using an abundance of primary and secondary sources on American air power, this dissertation demonstrates that airmen’s struggle for a separate service was not something that developed slowly over the course of decades. Instead, this dissertation shows that airmen wanted independence from the U. S. Army from the start. From their point of view, the U. S. Army, the War Department, and Congress never really appreciated or understood air power. As a result, airmen became more and more alienated with each passing year until they achieve want they wanted [...] independence...|$|R

60|$|By the {{foregoing}} it is perceived that {{the period from}} the beginning of Mr. Clay's official life in 1803 to the end of 1852 is but one year short of half a century, and that the sum of all the intervals in it will not amount to ten years. But mere duration of time in office constitutes the smallest part of Mr. Clay's history. Throughout that long period he has constantly been the most loved and most implicitly followed by friends, and the most dreaded by opponents, of all living American politicians. In all the great questions which have agitated the country, and particularly in those fearful crises, the Missouri question, the nullification question, and the late slavery question, as connected with the newly acquired territory, involving and endangering the stability of the Union, his has been the leading and most conspicuous part. In 1824 he was first a candidate for the Presidency, and was defeated; and, although he was successively defeated for the same office in 1832 and in 1844, {{there has never been a}} moment since 1824 till after 1848 when a very large portion of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not cling to him with an enthusiastic hope and purpose of still elevating him to the Presidency. With other men, to be defeated was to be forgotten; but with him defeat was but a trifling incident, neither changing him nor the world's estimate of him. Even those of both political parties who have been preferred to him for the highest office have run far briefer courses than he, and left him still shining high in the heavens of the political world. Jackson, Van Buren, Harnson, Polk, and Taylor all rose after, and set long before him. The spell--the long-enduring spell--with which the souls of men were bound to him is a miracle. Who can compass it? It is probably true he owed his pre-eminence to no one quality, but to a fortunate combination of several. He was surpassingly eloquent; but many eloquent men fail utterly, and they are not, as a class, generally successful. His judgment was excellent; but many men of good judgment live and die unnoticed. His will was indomitable; but this quality often secures to its owner nothing better than a character for useless obstinacy. These, then, were Mr. Clay's leading qualities. No one of them is very uncommon; but all together are rarely combined in a single individual, and this is probably the reason why such men as Henry Clay are so rare in the world.|$|R

Instead, they hid bad policy choices and violation of the liberties of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> people.For example, <b>the</b> director of the NSA said publicly that the NSA doesn't hold data on U.S. citizens. That was obviously untrue.Justice Department officials testified that Section 215 of the Patriot Act is analogous to grand jury subpoena authority, and that deceptive statement was made on multiple occasions.Officials also suggested that the NSA doesn't have the authority to read Americans' e-mails without a warrant.

40|$|This {{course will}} {{introduce}} you to <b>the</b> <b>American</b> political system and the core theories that seek to explain U. S. politics.

What role do parties and interest groups play in representing the diverse views and interests of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people?</b> Why <b>does</b> America rarely have a credible third party alternative? Why do citizens participate in politics? I have three main goals for the semester. First, on a substantive level, I {{hope that you will}} establish a solid foundation for understanding U. S. politics. To accomplish this goal the course will {{introduce you to}} a variety of academic theories that scholars have developed to explain how <b>the</b> <b>American</b> political system operates. Second, from a procedural standpoint, I hope you will hone your critical thinking and reading skills. In other words, I want you to further your ability to carefully interrogate ideas, arguments, and evidence. Finally, I hope that this course encourages you to ask questions about the political world. As developing scholars (and soon-to-be thesis writers) it is essential that you learn how to ask and answer questions that are important to you. This course begins that process by showing you how previous scholars have asked and answered their questions about how American politics works...|$|R

[...] At least one historian has attributed Eisenhower's support for Bradley's subsequent promotion to (temporary) four-star general (March 1945, not made permanent until January 1949) to, in part, a desire to compensate him for the way in which he had been sidelined during the Battle of the Bulge. [...] Others point out that both Secretary of War Stimson and General Eisenhower had desired to reward General Patton with a fourth star for his string of accomplishments in 1944, but that Eisenhower could not promote Patton over Bradley, Devers, and other senior commanders without upsetting the chain of command (as Bradley commanded these people in the theater).|$|R
