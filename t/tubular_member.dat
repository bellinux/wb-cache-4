40|$|ABSTRACT: Over {{the past}} few decades various {{experimental}} and theoretical investigations have been performed on offshore <b>tubular</b> <b>members</b> with regard to damage resistance and residual strength. Analysis of damaged <b>tubular</b> <b>members</b> requires a three-dimensional shell analysis for accurate results.

In this paper, empirical equations are provided for a more accurate beam-column analysis of damaged tubes including the relationships between the lateral denting load and the depth of the dent, the rate of dent deepening due to increasing curvature and the longitudinal variation in the dent depth of damaged tubes. A design equation to predict the ultimate bending capacities of damaged offshore <b>tubular</b> <b>members</b> is also presented...|$|R

This paper investigates the response of offshore <b>tubular</b> <b>members</b> subjected to vessel bow and stern impacts with the nonlinear finite element code LS-DYNA. Two 7500 tons displacement supply vessels of modern design are modeled. Force-displacement curves for bow and stern indentation by rigid tubes are compared with design curves in the DNV-GL RP C 204. Next, both the ship structure and the tubular braces/legs are modeled using nonlinear shell finite elements, {{and the effect of}} ship-platform interaction on the damage distribution is investigated. A parametric study of the denting mechanics with respect to the length, diameter and wall thickness of <b>tubular</b> <b>members</b> is described. An existing analytical denting model is extended to account for distributed loads and is verified against simulation results. Existing requirements to resist excessive local denting are discussed, and a new concept ‘transition indentation ratio’ is introduced.

An experimental investigation of lean {{duplex stainless}} steel <b>tubular</b> <b>members</b> subjected to web crippling {{is presented in}} this paper. The test specimens were strengthened with adhesive bonded carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP). The web crippling tests were conducted under End-Two-Flange, Interior-Two-Flange, End-One-Flange and Interior-One-Flange loading conditions. A total of 38 web crippling tests was conducted. The investigation was mainly focused {{on the effects of}} web slenderness of lean duplex stainless steel tubular sections on CFRP strengthening against web crippling. The lean duplex stainless steel type EN 1. 4162 was used in the investigation. The tests were performed on five different sizes of square and rectangular hollow sections that covered a wide range of web slenderness ratio from 8. 1 to 57. 0. Three different failure modes were observed in the tests of the strengthened specimens, namely the adhesion, interlaminar failure of CFRP plate and combination of adhesion and interlaminar failure of CFRP plate. It is shown that the web crippling strength of lean duplex stainless steel <b>tubular</b> <b>members</b> may increase up to 76 % due to the strengthening of CFRP...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the blast loading trials on steel <b>tubular</b> <b>members</b> {{with and without}} concrete infill. The standoff distances considered in this trial were selected to demonstrate the response of these steel sections to contact and very close-range detonations of high explosive (HE). The main objective of the trials {{was to investigate the}} effects of contact and near-field explosions on steel square <b>tubular</b> <b>members</b> and to demonstrate the effect of standoff variations on the mode of response and failure of steel square sections. The experimental data collected during these trials can be used for verification of theoretical and numerical models of response of steel tubular columns subjected to contact and close-range blasts. Due to difficulties with collecting quantitative data (displacements, blast pressures, etc.) in the close proximity of a detonating HE charge, analysis of the steel tubes in this paper is confined mostly to qualitative assessment based on visual observations of the structural damage and limited numerical simulations of the blast-structure interaction using LS-DYNA aimed at clarifying some important phenomena that were not available to be obtained directly from the explosive tests. A new simplified approach to predicting the dynamic response of square <b>tubular</b> steel <b>members</b> subjected to the near-field airblast loading is proposed.

40|$|The {{majority}} of the offshore installations {{around the world are}} operating beyond their design life. These installations are subjected to a harsh marine environment and often have significant damages from corrosion. Corrosion can significantly affect the ultimate strength of <b>tubular</b> jacket <b>members</b> including the buckling resistance. A number of studies have been performed in the past on the effect of corrosion on the buckling resistance of <b>tubular</b> <b>members.</b> However, most of these studies were either based on limited experimental tests or numerical analyses of few cases resulting in semi-empirical relations. Moreover, none of the earlier proposed empirical relations considered the effect of initial imperfections. Also, there are no available guidelines and recommendations in the currently available design codes. To fulfil this research gap, a new formula is proposed to consider the effect of patch corrosion on the buckling resistance of <b>tubular</b> <b>members.</b> The proposed formula is verified with results from finite element analyses performed on several members and for varying corrosion patch parameters. The members are selected to represent the most relevant European buckling curve for <b>tubular</b> <b>members.</b> Based on this study, it is concluded that corrosion reduces the buckling resistance significantly. It is also concluded that the angular extent and thickness wastage of the corrosion patch are more critical for the buckling resistance compared to its height. The proposed formula is also applied to an existing offshore jacket structure. The buckling capacity of jacket members in the splash zone reduces significantly with ageing. This reduction is around 10 % for the leg member and 22 % for the brace member with a design life of 20 years. The significance and applicability of the proposed formula is therefore highlighted through this case study. Finally, it is concluded that the proposed formula can be easily applied by practising engineers for an accurate estimation of the residual buckling resistance of corroded <b>tubular</b> <b>members,</b> without the need for any advanced numerical analyses...|$|R
