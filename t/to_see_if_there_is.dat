Close matches may often join a surname project. DNA companies will usually provide information about how closely related two matches are, based on the difference between their results.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, The Journal of Bone and Mineral Research {{published}} a meta-analysis examining whether milk consumption might protect against hip fracture in middle-aged and older adults. Studies {{could find no}} association between drinking milk and lower rates of fractures. In 2014, JAMA Pediatrics {{published a}} report after monitoring almost 100,000 men and women {{for more than two}} decades. Subjects were asked to report on how much milk they had consumed as teenagers, and were followed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> any association with a reduced chance of hip fractures later in life, it found there was not any. A study published in The BMJ that followed more than 45,000 men and 61,000 women in Sweden age 39 and older had similar results. Milk consumption in adults was associated with no protection for men, and an increased risk of fractures in women. The risk of any bone fracture increased 16 percent in women who drank three or more glasses daily, and the risk of a broken hip increased 60 percent. It was also associated with an increased risk of death in both sexes.|$|E
