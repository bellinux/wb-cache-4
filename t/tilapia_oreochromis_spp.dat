40|$|Abstract: <b>Tilapia</b> (<b>Oreochromis</b> <b>spp.)</b> were {{collected}} seasonally from four contaminated rivers in southwestern Taiwan for studies of morphological deformities {{that could be}} used as biomarkers of contamination. Morphological deformities found in tilapia were separated into 15 categories. Overall, the prevalence of deformities such as split fins, lower lip extension and gill deformities were significantly related to various water quality parameters, including low DO and high ammonium, lead and zinc concentrations. The persistence of tilapia in polluted waters {{and the development of a}} suite of morphological deformities suggest that tilapia can be used as sentinels of non-point source pollution in rivers...|$|E

Foram processadas 4260 tilápias (2560 quilos), registrando-se os pesos totais dos peixes e de suas partes principais, o desempenho da mão-de-obra e o tempo gasto no processo. Os peixes foram distribuidos em três classes de peso (300 a 600 g; 601 a 800 g e 801 a 1000 g) O rendimento médio de filetagem foi de 31, 0 %, variando de 28, 9 % a 33, 6 %, complementado por 36, 0 % de cabeça e vísceras, 8, 0 % de pele, 22, 0 % de resíduo ósseo e 3, 0 % de restos de toilet.

This {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in order to evaluate some technical aspects of the industrial processing of <b>tilapias</b> (<b>Oreochromis</b> <b>spp.),</b> with emphasis on the filefishing profitability in an industry, located in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. During a period between January and November, 2004, 4260 fishes, totalling 2560 kg, with individual weights ranging from 300 to 1000 g (mean individual weight of 600 g) were processed. Data collected comprehended total body weight, and parts weight, such as: head and viscera, filefish, skin, carcass residue and "toilet" residue, aiming to correlating the per cent value of each part, also considering: fish size method of cutting and processing time.

30|$|<b>Tilapia</b> (<b>Oreochromis</b> <b>spp.)</b> are {{reported}} {{to be among the}} most cultured food fish worldwide (Klesius et al. 2008). About 80 % of the global farmed tilapia production in 2002 showed Asia as the largest world producer. Among the Asian countries, Malaysia is listed among the top ten producers of farmed tilapia (El-Sayed 2006). Tilapia, also known as “aquatic chicken” are fast growing with ability to survive in poor water conditions. They are white flesh, eat variety of food, easy to breed with simple and non-complicated hatchery technology (Nandlal and Pickering 2004).

30|$|Tilapia, {{which is}} {{originated}} from Africa, {{has become one}} of the major cultured fish in the world after carp fish (El-Sayed 2006; Wang and Lu 2015). This is because tilapia has the ability to tolerate a wide range of environment conditions, allowing them to be introduced and distributed to many countries outside Africa such as Asia, Southeast Asia, USA and Europe (El-Sayed 2006; Philippart and Ruwet 1982). The tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus Peters, 1852, was first introduced to Malaysia from Indonesia in 1943. Later, Oreochromis niloticus Linnaeus, 1785 was introduced in 1979 because of its fast growing features that are suitable for aquaculture (FAO 2004).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the environmental performance of aquaculture in the city of Colorado do Oeste, Rond&# 244;nia State, Brazil. Fifteen fish farmers were interviewed.

The questionnaire considered 12 items, organized into three main topics: a) social and legal standards b) environmental standards c) standards of food safety and hygiene. The questionnaire considered 12 items, organized into three main topics: a) social and legal standards b) environmental standards c) standards of food safety and hygiene. Aquaculture in the city of Colorado do Oeste, Rond&# 244;nia presents two fish production systems: extensive and semi-intensive. In the semi-intensive system, stocking rate was one fish per m 3, on average; tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), <b>tilapias</b> (<b>Oreochromis</b> <b>spp.),</b> pirarucu (Arapaima gigas) and pintado (Pseudoplatystoma spp.) were the species farmed at the largest number. The rate of water renewal was due to the greater availability of natural food in this system. Water renewal was constant in the ponds (1, 500 liters per minute). In the semi-intensive system using dug ponds, alevins were stocked and fed during the entire rearing time with natural and exogenous food. The extensive system relied on the natural production of the pond, with stocking density limited by the production of natural food. The little renewal of water made the cultivation tank itself acted as a decantation lake, with the occurrence of oxidation and sedimentation of residual organic matter, consisting of feces, debris and organic fertilizer. Production of reduced effluent volume took place in the extensive system, compared to the cultivation area. In addition, there was high water turbidity, caused by high concentration of planktonic organisms, and low concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the water. Data showed that nine estates of the interviewed fish farmers had critical environmental performance (less than 30. 0 %).

We observed that none of the studied establishments were in accordance with the standards recommended by the legislation. Regarding the sensory evaluation, 83. 3 % of the samples showed compliance with the requirements of the legislation. As for the coliforms at 45 °C essay, the results ranged from 0. 477 to 1. 509 log 10 CFU/g; in the Staphylococcus spp. essay we found results from 4. 854 to 5. 397 log 10 CFU/g; and further, we found values from 3. 884 to 4. 937 and from 4. 707 to 5. 463 log 10 CFU/g for enterobacteria and psychrotrophic bacteria, respectively. All the samples were within the requirements for contamination by Salmonella spp. (absence). The pH ranged from 5. 99 to 6. 18 and temperatures indicated non-compliance with the recommendations.
