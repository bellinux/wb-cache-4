5|$|After 1994, Reck Club {{restored}} the wheels and brakes to original Model A specifications. Reck Club performed a major off body restoration in the Spring of 2000 <b>that</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> car repainted and the motor rebuilt. Pete George, although several years retired, aided Reck Club in its restoration providing funding and labor to the 2000 restoration. After the restoration, a small modification replaced the electrical generator {{with a more}} efficient Nu-Rex alternator.|$|E
5|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 2003 college {{football}} season, Virginia Tech struggled. Following an 8–4 regular season, <b>that</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Hokies lose four of its last sixregular-season games, Tech accepted a bid to the 2003 Insight Bowl. Facing the Hokies were the California Golden Bears, who had gone 7–6 during the regular season, tying for third place in the Pacific-10 Conference.|$|E

50|$|For example: {{a witness}} who testifies <b>that</b> he <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> {{defendant}} shoot the victim gives direct evidence. A witness who testifies <b>that</b> he <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> defendant fleeing {{the scene of the}} crime, or a forensics expert who says that ballistics proves that the defendant’s gun shot the bullet that killed the victim both give circumstantial evidence from which the defendant’s guilt may be inferred.|$|R
5|$|Faced with dwindling attendances, the Kilcoynes {{decided to}} starve {{the club and}} sold off senior players who were {{replaced}} by junior footballers. On a tour of Japan in 1975, Mick Meagan and Theo Dunne’s young side defeated the Japanese national team 3–2 in front of 60,000 spectators at the Olympic Stadium, but that victory was the highlight of a season <b>that</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> team finish bottom {{of the table and}} re-apply for admission into the League of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|For {{a second}} series running, the revamped theme tune {{introduced}} back in January 2014 during Series 28 {{remained the same}} with the exception of episode two <b>that</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> use of the first ever theme tune and title card, with the original 1986 theme tune playing over a montage of Series 1 and Series thirty characters. Albeit with the closing credits remaining the same. The titles are modified as characters arrive or depart throughout the course of the series.|$|E
5|$|Pullman Square is a {{lifestyle}} center in downtown Huntington, West Virginia, United States between 8th and 10th Street and 3rd Avenue and Veteran's Memorial Boulevard.

50|$|Testimony can be direct {{evidence}} {{or it can}} be circumstantial. For instance, a witness saying <b>that</b> she <b>saw</b> a defendant stab a victim is providing {{direct evidence}}. By contrast, a witness who says <b>that</b> she <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> defendant enter a house, that she heard screaming, and <b>that</b> she <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> defendant leave with a bloody knife gives circumstantial evidence. It is the necessity for inference, and not the obviousness of a conclusion, that determines whether evidence is circumstantial.|$|R

5|$|Seattle {{was unable}} to repeat their successes in the 2014 season. The season started successfully, with several key wins <b>that</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> team {{at the top of}} the Western Conference by June. During a 2015 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup match against the Portland Timbers on June 16, however, Obafemi Martins left the game with a groin injury and Clint Dempsey was {{suspended}} after tearing a referee's pocketbook, though he would be called away for the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup.|$|E
5|$|The {{game against}} the Islanders also {{featured}} a devastating open-ice hit by Dion Phaneuf on New York's Kyle Okposo <b>that</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> young forward taken off on a stretcher and sent to hospital with a concussion. The hit led Pascal Morency to leave his team's bench to engage Phaneuf as a melee {{broke out in the}} aftermath of the check. The league reviewed the incident and suspended Morency ten games for leaving the bench.|$|E
5|$|Winnipeg {{developed}} rapidly {{after the}} coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1881. The railway divided the North End, which housed mainly Eastern Europeans, from the richer Anglo-Saxon southern part of the city. It also contributed to a demographic shift beginning shortly after Confederation <b>that</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> francophone population decrease from a majority to a small minority group. This shift resulted in Premier Thomas Greenway controversially ending legislative bilingualism and removing funding for French Catholic Schools in 1890.|$|E

5|$|After her commissioning, Augsburg {{spent her}} peacetime career {{first as a}} torpedo test ship {{and then as a}} gunnery {{training}} ship. After the outbreak of World War I, she was assigned to the Baltic Sea, where she spent the entire war. On 2 August 1914, she participated in an operation <b>that</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> first shots of the war with Russia fired, and she later took part in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915 and Operation Albion in October 1917, as well as numerous smaller engagements throughout the war. She struck a mine, once, in January 1915, though the ship was again operational in a few months. After the end of the war, Augsburg was ceded to Japan as a war prize, and was subsequently broken up for scrap in 1922.|$|E
5|$|After {{the move}} to Exeter, Leofric worked to {{increase}} the endowment of the diocese, and especially the cathedral library, which he found almost empty upon his arrival. He later claimed that there were only five books owned by the cathedral chapter when he became bishop. He still remained on good terms with the king, for he was present at Edward's Christmas court in 1065 <b>that</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> consecration of Edward's Westminster Abbey church at Westminster. No evidence survives that Leofric was employed by the king in any diplomatic missions, nor does Leofric appear to have attended any papal councils or synods. He was {{a supporter of the}} cult of Leo IX, who was proclaimed a saint after Leo's death.|$|E
5|$|After their commissioning, Kolberg, Mainz, and Cöln were {{assigned}} to the II Scouting Group, part of the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet. Augsburg was instead used as a training ship for torpedo crews and gunnery. Cöln was assigned as the flagship of Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the II Scouting Group was deployed to a patrol line based on the island of Heligoland. Augsburg meanwhile was mobilized for active service and sent into the Baltic. There, she participated in an operation <b>that</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> first shots of the war fired against the Russians, on 2 August.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1860s, Levski {{developed}} a revolutionary theory <b>that</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Bulgarian liberation movement as an armed uprising of all Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire. The insurrection was to be prepared, controlled and coordinated internally by a central revolutionary organisation, which was to include local revolutionary committees in all parts of Bulgaria and operate independently from any foreign factors. Levski's theory resulted from the repeated failures to implement Rakovski's ideas effectively, {{such as the use of}} foreign-based armed detachments (чети, cheti) to provoke a general revolt. Levski's idea of an entirely independent revolution did not enjoy the approval of the entire population either—in fact, he was the only prominent Bulgarian revolutionary to advocate it. Instead, many regarded an intervention by the great powers as a more feasible solution.|$|E
5|$|In England, Stephen's reign {{started off}} well, with lavish gatherings {{of the royal}} court <b>that</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> King give out grants of land and favours to his supporters. Stephen {{received}} the support of Pope Innocent II, {{thanks in part to}} the testimony of Louis VI and Theobald. Troubles rapidly began to emerge. Matilda's uncle, David I of Scotland, invaded the north of England on the news of Henry's death, taking Carlisle, Newcastle and other key strongholds. Stephen rapidly marched north with an army and met David at Durham, where a temporary compromise was agreed. South Wales rose in rebellion, and by 1137 Stephen was forced to abandon attempts to suppress the revolt. Stephen put down two revolts in the south-west led by Baldwin de Redvers and Robert of Bampton; Baldwin was released after his capture and travelled to Normandy, where he became a vocal critic of the King.|$|E
5|$|In winter 546/7, {{when the}} new Byzantine {{governor}} and commander-in-chief, John Troglita, arrived in Africa, Cutzinas and his followers joined him, and participated in the expedition <b>that</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> defeat and submission of Antalas. Shortly after, Cutzinas received the supreme Roman military rank of magister militum from Troglita. In the summer of 547 Cutzinas accompanied Troglita in his campaign against the Tripolitanian tribes under Carcasan. Before the Battle of Marta he advocated attacking the rebel forces, but the Byzantine army was heavily defeated by Carcasan and Antalas, who had once more risen in revolt. In the same winter, Cutzinas quarreled with another pro-Byzantine Berber leader, Ifisdaias. Their dispute threatened to spill over into open armed conflict, but the intervention of Troglita prevented this and the official John effected a reconciliation between the two.|$|E

5|$|No. 19 Virginia Tech {{earned a}} bid to the 2009 Orange Bowl via an {{automatic}} bid, courtesy of a 30–12 victory against Boston College in the 2008 ACC Championship Game <b>that</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Hokies named champions of the Atlantic Coast Conference. The game was played on January 1, 2009, and also featured the No. 12 Cincinnati Bearcats, champions of the Big East Conference. Pregame {{media coverage of the}} game focused {{on the fact that the}} 2009 Orange Bowl was Cincinnati's first Bowl Championship Series game in school history, and despite their bowl-game inexperience, the Bearcats were favored to win by two and a half points on the eve of the game.|$|E
5|$|Ole Miss {{scored the}} only {{points of the}} third quarter on a 12-yard Randall Mackey {{touchdown}} run that capped a 70-yard drive <b>that</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Rebels convert a pair of fourth downs. The final margin of 33–14 was provided by a pair of Shelley field goals from 26 and 24 yards in the fourth quarter. In the game, McCarron eclipsed Brody Croyle's team record of 190 consecutive pass attempts without throwing an interception. Starting wide receiver DeAndrew White and backup running back Demetrius Hart both suffered knee injuries {{during the course of the}} game that sidelined both of them for the remainder of the season. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Rebels to 46–9–2 (50–8–2 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E

The match ended {{in an easy}} victory for Australia when New Zealand was bowled out for 42 and 54, but the tour attracted big crowds and made a record profit. Hassett scored 351 runs at 70.20 for the whole tour. By the time he returned home from the tour, Hassett had played cricket continuously for almost twelve months.|$|E
