Additional flavor and nutrition was provided from inexpensive canned <b>tomato</b> <b>paste</b> and puree, hummus, tahina, and mayonnaise in tubes.

40|$|Many plant {{pathogenic}} fungi are {{the subject}} of intense study because they cause disease symptoms that have a severe negative effect on the yield or quality of tomatoes (Lycopersicum esculentum M.) and its products. The common fungi associated with <b>tomatoes</b> and <b>tomato</b> <b>pastes</b> were determined and compared to get information on whether the mould content of the <b>tomato</b> <b>pastes</b> originate entirely from the tomato or from the soil. Eighteen species which belong to 7 fungal genera (Alternaria, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Mucor, Penicillium, Rhizopus and Trichoderma) among 250 mould isolates were determined of tomatoes and home-made <b>tomato</b> <b>pastes</b> collected from Manisa Province and its surrounding (Turkey). Alternaria alternata was the most prevalent fungal species. Members of Aspergillus niger group represent 1 / 6 th of all the identified species.

5|$|The soup {{has even}} {{played a role}} in the Soviet space program. In March 1961, as part of a {{communications}} equipment test, a pre-recorded recipe for borscht was broadcast from the Korabl-Sputnik 4 spacecraft. The craft, carrying animals and a mannequin, had been launched into low Earth orbit in preparation for manned space flights. Actual borscht eventually made its way into outer space as space food for Soviet and, later, Russian cosmonauts. Originally, a puréed version of borscht was supplied in tubes. All ingredients for the space borscht (which include beef, beetroots, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onions, parsley root and <b>tomato</b> <b>paste)</b> were cooked separately, then combined one by one in strictly controlled order, sterilized, packed into tubes, sealed airtight and autoclaved. In the 1970s, the tubes were replaced with packages of rehydratable freeze-dried borscht with regular-size bits of cooked vegetables.|$|E
5|$|The term iftar has a {{different}} meaning in Ramadan where {{it is used to}} describe the 'breaking of fasting' unlike its common meaning of breakfast in the morning. Iftar begins with soup, either made from lentils, vegetables or freekeh. Shurbat freekeh ("freekeh soup") is made from cracked, green wheat cooked in chicken broth. There is a wide variety of meals served during iftar, ranging from small plates or bowls vegetable-based courses or saniyyehs (large plates or trays) of a particular meat. Common small dishes on the dinner table are bamia—a name for okra in <b>tomato</b> <b>paste,</b> mloukhiyeh—a corchorus stew—or maqali, an array of fried tomatoes, aubergines, potatoes, peppers and zucchini. Pilaf or plain freekeh are normally served alongside the dinner meat. Each household prepares extra food to provide for their neighbors and the less fortunate—who must receive an equal version of the food eaten at home.|$|E

50|$|A plum tomato, {{also known}} as a {{processing}} <b>tomato</b> or <b>paste</b> <b>tomato,</b> is a type of tomato bred for sauce and packing purposes. They are generally oval or cylindrical in shape, with significantly fewer locules (seed compartments) than standard round tomatoes (usually only two) and a generally higher solid content, making them more suitable for processing. Plum tomatoes are also sometimes favored by cooks for use during the tomato off-season, as they are generally considered more amenable to handling and are therefore available in a state closer to ripe than other supermarket tomatoes.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of total solid concentration, heating {{time and temperature}} on the changes in redox potential of <b>tomato</b> <b>pastes</b> was studied. Results showed that the reducing properties of the tomato samples were greatly affected by these parameters. In particular, low temperature long time treatments led to the greatest increase in redox potential, which can be attributable {{to a loss of}} naturally occurring anti-oxidants. On the contrary, treatments at high temperatures caused little overall change in the redox potential. It was concluded that when severe heating is applied, the formation of heat-induced Maillard reaction products, with anti-oxidant properties, might balance the increase in the redox potential caused by the thermal degradation of tomato natural anti-oxidants...|$|R

25|$|Unlike other {{fruits and}} vegetables, where {{nutritional}} content such as vitamin C is diminished upon cooking, processing of tomatoes increases {{the concentration of}} bioavailable lycopene. Lycopene in <b>tomato</b> <b>paste</b> is up to four times more bioavailable than in fresh tomatoes. The reason is that in raw plant foods, lycopene is insoluble in water and is tightly bound to vegetable fiber. Processed tomato products such as pasteurized tomato juice, soup, sauce, and ketchup contain a higher concentration of bioavailable lycopene compared to raw tomatoes.|$|E

500|$|Raw {{ground beef}} is crumbled in water and/or stock, <b>tomato</b> <b>paste</b> and {{seasonings}} are added, and {{the mixture is}} brought {{to a boil and}} then simmered for several hours to form a thin meat sauce.

500|$|The {{vegetables}} {{most commonly}} added to borscht are beetroots, white cabbage, carrots, parsley root, potatoes, onions and tomatoes. Some recipes may also call for beans, tart apples, turnip, celeriac, zucchini or bell peppers. Parsnip {{may be used}} as a substitute for parsley root, and <b>tomato</b> <b>paste</b> is often used as well as or instead of fresh tomatoes. The traditional technique of preparing the soup is to precook the vegetables – by sautéing, braising, boiling or baking – separately from the meat and only then to combine them with the stock. This distinctive feature of borscht derives from the practice of slow cooking in the Russian oven (traditional masonry stove, used for both cooking and heating), wherein the differences in cooking times of individual ingredients had {{to be taken into account}} in order to ensure that all components reach doneness at the same time. The importance of this method is reflected in the Russian language, where a variant in which all vegetables are added raw directly into the stock is referred to by the diminutive form [...] rather than [...] Vegetables are usually julienned, except for potatoes and zucchini, which are diced. The beetroots may be partially baked before being sprinkled with vinegar or lemon juice to preserve the color and braised separately from other vegetables. Onions, carrots, parsley root, turnip and other root vegetables are sautéed (traditionally in animal fat, especially lard or butter) and then mixed with tomatoes or <b>tomato</b> <b>paste.</b> Dry beans are boiled separately. Potatoes and cabbage are boiled in the stock for about 15 minutes before the precooked vegetables are added.|$|E
40|$|A {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} method was applied for {{the determination of the}} levels of benzoate and sorbate in 400 food samples, including pickled cucumbers, canned <b>tomato</b> <b>pastes,</b> sour cherry jams, soft drinks, fruit juices and dairy products (UF-Feta cheeses, Lighvan cheeses, lactic cheeses, yogurts and doogh). The results showed that 270 (67. 5 %) of all samples contained benzoate ranging from 11. 9 to 288. 5 mg kg⁻¹ in lactic cheese and fruit juice, respectively. The levels of sorbate in 98 (24. 5 %) of the samples were 20. 1 to 284. 3 mg kg⁻¹ in doogh and fruit juice, respectively. Moreover, benzoate was detected in all dairy products ranging from 11. 9 mg kg⁻¹ in lactic cheese to 91. 2 mg kg⁻¹ in UF-Feta cheese. A low concentration of benzoate could originate naturally, due to specific biochemical mechanisms during cheese, yogurt and doogh maturation. In conclusion, a minimum level for benzoate in dairy products should be defined in the legislation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
