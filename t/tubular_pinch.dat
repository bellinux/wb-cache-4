50|$|The <b>tubular</b> <b>pinch</b> {{effect is}} a {{phenomenon}} in fluid mechanics, which has importance in membrane technology.|$|E
50|$|Operating {{conditions}} during {{membrane filtration}} are also vital, {{as they may}} affect fouling conditions during filtration. For instance, crossflow filtration is always preferred to dead end filtration, because turbulence generated during the filtration entails a thinner deposit layer and therefore minimises fouling (e.g. <b>tubular</b> <b>pinch</b> effect).|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{have shown}} that in dilute {{suspension}} flow at laminar state through a circular tube particles migrate towards a concentric annular region with a mean radius of about 0. 6 of the tube radius. This phenomenon is well-known as the <b>tubular</b> <b>pinch</b> effect, which is still not fully understood. In this study, the energy gradient method is used to study this phenomenon. It is found that at low Reynolds number particles will move {{to the position of}} r/R= 0. 58. Based on the result, the mechanism of this phenomenon is well explained.

40|$|The {{endosome}} {{system is}} a collection of organelles that sort membrane-associated proteins and lipids for lysosomal degradation or recycling back to their target organelle. Recycling cargo is captured in a network of membrane tubules emanating from endosomes where <b>tubular</b> carriers <b>pinch</b> off. These tubules are formed and stabilized through the scaffolding properties of cytosolic Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) proteins that comprise phosphoinositide-detecting moieties, recruiting these proteins to specific endosomal membrane areas. These include the protein family of sorting nexins that remodel endosome membrane into tubules by an evolutionary conserved mechanism of dimerization, local membrane curvature detection/induction and oligomerization. How the formation of such a tubular membrane carrier is coordinated with cargo capture is largely unknown. The tubular structure of the membrane carriers could sequester membrane-bound cargo through an iterative mechanism of geometric sorting. Furthermore, the recent identification of cargo adaptors for the endosome protein sorting complex retromer has expanded the sorting signals that retrieve specific sets of cargo away from lysosomal degradation through distinct membrane trafficking pathways. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|It is {{presented}} an alternative formulation {{to solve the}} problem of the deformation analysis for <b>tubular</b> element under <b>pinching</b> loads. The solution is based on a new displacement field defined from a total set of trigonometric functions. The solution is developed in a multi-nodal finite tubular ring element with a total of eight degrees of freedom per section considered. The purpose of this paper is to provide an easy alternative formulation when compared with a complex finite shell element or beam element analysis for the same application. Several case studies presented have been compared and discussed with numerical analyses results reported by other authors and the results obtained with a shell element from a Cosmos/M® programme...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{fundamental}} aspects of microfluidic systems and applies relevant findings to innovative designs for advanced particle manipulation applications. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is adopted for fluid modeling, {{based on the}} Finite Volume method. The accuracy of the solutions obtained is confirmed by grid sensitivity analysis and by comparisons with experimental work. Curved microchannel features and the induced Dean flow are studied through a parametric space exploration and simulations. The Lagrange-Euler coupling method – Surface Marker Point methodology – is applied to simulate large-size particles (of comparable size to the channel). Through this simulation approach, all the forces on such particles are directly derived through solving the governing equations {{and the influence of}} these particles on the flow is considered in a fully coupled manner. A new approach – the Frozen Flow & Flow Correction Coefficient method – is developed, making trans-relaxation-time simulations possible and improving computational efficiency significantly, for 3 D simulations of arbitrary shape and size microparticles in complicated microfluidic channels. Detailed comparisons between simulation results and experiments involving particle sedimentation and particle equilibrium position have been conducted for methodology validation. Mechanisms of hydrodynamic particle manipulation are then studied, including hydrodynamic focusing and separation. It is found that the <b>Tubular</b> <b>Pinch</b> effect, Dean flow and the Radial Pressure Gradient effect interact to yield two distinct particle separation mechanisms. For advanced applications, particle focusing, non-magnetic and magnetic separation for neutrally buoyant particles are proposed, based on newly gained insight on the above-mentioned mechanisms. Appropriate channel designs have been proposed both for particle focusing and size-based particle separation, while the vertical-magnetic-Dean separation scheme is highlighted for magnetic separation. Finally, a new integrated system is proposed, that combines the above novel designs into a device-like ensemble. It promises to offer functionality for biomaterial separation and detection, including different types of cells, antigens and biomarkers. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|E
