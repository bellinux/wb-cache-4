5|$|During the American Civil War (18611865), cavalry {{held the}} most {{important}} and respected role it would ever hold in the American military. Field artillery in the American Civil War was also highly mobile. Both horses and mules pulled the guns, though only horses were used on the battlefield. At the beginning of the war, most of the experienced cavalry officers were from the South and thus joined the Confederacy, leading to the Confederate Army's initial battlefield superiority. The tide <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1863 Battle of Brandy Station, part of the Gettysburg campaign, where the Union cavalry, in the largest cavalry battle ever fought on the American continent, ended the dominance of the South. By 1865, Union cavalry were decisive in achieving victory. So important were horses to individual soldiers that the surrender terms at Appomattox allowed every Confederate cavalryman to take his horse home with him. This was because, unlike their Union counterparts, Confederate cavalrymen provided their own horses for service instead of drawing them from the government.|$|E

25|$|The Vulcan railcars had a driver's {{compartment}} at each end, so {{they did}} not need to be <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> terminus for the return journey. They originally had 28 and 22 seats in the two passenger compartments. In the mid-1950s the smaller compartment in each vehicle was reduced by 2 seats and replaced with a small guard's compartment, thus reducing the total number of passengers from 50 to 48. A luggage compartment had space for about 1 ton of luggage, and an onboard toilet was provided.|$|E

5000|$|Two-player [...] (or larger) teams compete by {{alternating}} {{teams and}} alternating players within each team. For example, if teams consist of players 1 and 2 versus players 3 and 4, and player 1 breaks, turns alternate {{in the pattern}} 1 (breaking), 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 4, etc. I.e., the ending of a player's <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table ends that team's <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table. As in individual competition, a player's <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table does not end until a foul is committed or the player fails to legally pocket an object ball (or the frame ends).|$|R

2500|$|On 24 June 1913 Tacoma {{made its}} first regular run from Seattle to Tacoma in 77 minutes. [...] This was a new speed record for the route. [...] With {{the aid of a}} tug, Tacoma could be <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tacoma {{municipal}} dock in 2.5 minutes, half the time it took to turn Indianapolis, then the other major vessel on the route. [...] About six months after Tacoma began on the route, command of the vessel was taken over by Capt. Everett B. Coffin, one of the most experienced steamboat captains of Puget Sound. [...] He had commanded the famous Flyer for much of the time from 1890 to 1911 when Flyer had dominated the Seattle-Tacoma route in competition with the Puget Sound Navigation Company.|$|E
2500|$|The California Street (Line 61) line runs {{east and}} west on California Street from a {{terminal}} at California and Market Streets, close to the famed Embarcadero to Van Ness Avenue. The California street cable-cars use double-ended cars with [...] "grip" [...] levers {{at either end of}} the longer cars which are operated in each direction without the cars being <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ends of the line, where the double tracks converge into a single [...] "stub-end" [...] track. The line once ran a much longer distance from Presidio Avenue to Market Street but service west of Van Ness Avenue was discontinued in 1954. Calls to restore the route to its original length are heard from time to time but nothing serious towards this end has been proposed. This route runs only on California Street, running at first uphill to the summit of Nob Hill, then more gently downhill to a terminus at Van Ness Avenue. This line is used to a greater extent by commuters, with majority of passengers on weekdays being commuters.|$|E
