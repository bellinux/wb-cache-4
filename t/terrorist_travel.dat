We present {{an approach to}} an IDM solution of this problem, using semantic link analysis and visualization of findings. The approach is demonstrated in an application by a prototype system.

An important problem targeted by IDM is identification of terrorist networks, based on available intelligence.

Border crossings are commonplace; in 2005, for example, an estimated 13 million U. S. citizens crossed the northern border. In the heightened national security environment after September 11, we have previously reported that documents like driver's licenses and birth certificates can easily be obtained, altered, or counterfeited and used by <b>terrorists</b> to <b>travel</b> {{into and out of the}} country. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to develop and implement a plan that requires a passport or other document or combination of documents that the Secretary of Homeland Security deems sufficient to show identity and citizenship for U. S. citizens and citizens of Bermuda, Canada, and Mexico when entering the United States from certain countries in North, Central, or South America. The act requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of State (State) to implement this requirement by January 2008, and the effort to do so is called the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (Travel Initiative). As the statutory deadline for implementing DHS's and State's plans draws closer, questions have arisen about the agencies' progress in carrying out the Travel Initiative.

40|$|In {{the last}} fifteen months Europe has {{witnessed}} three major terrorist attacks, two in Paris in January and November 2015 and in Brussels in March 2016 killing 179 people in total. Prior to all three attacks <b>terrorists</b> had <b>travelled</b> form, to and within the European Union (EU). In addition to this, a terrorist attack was prevented by passengers on a Thalys train travelling from Amsterdam to Paris. Apart from attacks, {{a high number of}} EU citizens have travelled to conflict zones such as the terrorist group Islamic State’s self-proclaimed caliphate in Syria and Iraq, many of whom who have returned to EU Member States. In January 2015 the number of citizens from France, the UK, Germany and Belgium that travelled to join Islamic State was estimated to be 3, 050 (BBC 2015), a number that has risen since then. As a result there have been calls for the EU to introduce a Passenger Name Record (PNR) data Directive to monitor passenger airline travel out of and to EU Member States. PNR data transfer has not been without its problems and critique. This article will examine previous EU PNR agreements, mainly with the US, examining why they were problematic, with the main issue centring on the protection of passengers’ personal data. In 2011 the EU attempted to introduce a PNR data Directive, but again this failed because there was insufficient safeguards protecting personal data. However, since 2011 there have been significant developments in the protection of personal data in the EU.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Securing the nation's borders has taken on added importance since {{the terrorist attacks of}} September 11, 2001. For years, millions of citizens of the United States, Canada, and Bermuda could enter the United States from certain parts of the Western Hemisphere using a wide variety of documents, including a driver's license issued by a state motor vehicle administration or a birth certificate, or in some cases for U. S. and Canadian citizens, without showing any documents. In the heightened national security environment following September 11, we have previously reported that documents like driver's licenses and birth certificates can easily be obtained, altered, or counterfeited and used by <b>terrorists</b> to <b>travel</b> {{into and out of the}} country. To help provide better assurance that border officials have the tools and resources to establish that people are who they say they are, as called for in the 9 / 11 Commission report, section 7209 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, as amended, requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to develop and implement a plan that requires a passport or other document or combination of documents that the Secretary of Homeland Security deems sufficient to show identity and citizenship for U. S. citizens and citizens of Bermuda, Canada, and Mexico when entering the United States from certain countries in North, Central, or South America. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) and the Department of State's (State) effort to specify acceptable documents and implement document requirements at 326 air, land, and sea ports of entry is called the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI). DHS is required by law to implement WHTI document requirements at the land and sea ports of entry on the earlier of two dates: June 1, 2009, or 3 months after DHS and State certify that certain implementation requirements have been met. U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a component within DHS, is the lead agency in charge of inspecting travelers seeking to enter the United States at air, land, and sea ports of entry. CBP has created a WHTI program office within CBP's Office of Field Operations to manage efforts to propose acceptable documents, implement document requirements, and oversee technological upgrades. In fiscal year 2008, DHS requested about $ 252 million for WHTI implementation, including approximately $ 166 million for related technological upgrades [...] to develop new software and to deploy that software and new hardware at 13 of the highest-volume U. S. land ports of entry. According to DHS, implementation of the WHTI document requirements and related technological upgrades will support its strategic goal of facilitating legitimate trade and travel while enforcing all U. S. trade, immigration, drug, consumer protection, intellectual property, and agricultural laws and regulations at the borders. According to DHS, the technological upgrades are designed to improve customer service by avoiding a more time-intensive and intrusive inspection process that would result from meeting WHTI document requirements without this technology.
