5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Colombia has been improved {{in many ways}} over the past decades. Between 1990 and 2010, access to improved sanitation increased from 67% to 82%, but access to improved water source's increased only slightly from 89% to 94%. In particular, coverage in rural areas lags behind. Furthermore, despite improvements, the quality of water and sanitation services remains inadequate.

Water is drawn from the Willamette River from the Wilsonville Water Treatment Plant built {{at a cost of}} $46 million in conjunction with the Tualatin Valley Water District. The city used to use wells to provide drinking water, but those began to run dry in the late 1990s.

5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Turkey is characterised by achievements and challenges. Over the past decades access to drinking water {{has become almost}} universal and access to adequate sanitation has also increased substantially. Autonomous utilities have been created in the 16 metropolitan cities of Turkey and cost recovery has been increased, thus providing {{the basis for the}} sustainability of service provision. Intermittent supply, which was common in many cities, has become less frequent. In 2004, 61% of <b>the</b> <b>wastewater</b> collected through sewers was being treated. Remaining challenges include the need to further increase wastewater treatment, to reduce the high level of non-revenue water hovering around 50% and to expand access to adequate sanitation in rural areas. The investment required to comply with EU standards in the sector, especially in wastewater treatment, is estimated to be in the order of €2 billion per year, more than double the current level of investment.|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} was to study the removal {{efficiency}} of Pb from synthetic and industrial wastewaters by using biomass fly ashes. The biomass fly ashes were produced in a biomass boiler of a pulp and paper industry. Three concentrations of Pb 2 + were tested in <b>the</b> synthetic <b>wastewater</b> (1, 10 and 1000 mg Pb/L). Moreover, two different wastewaters were collected in an {{industrial wastewater treatment plant}} (IWWTP) of an industry of lead-acid batteries: (i) <b>wastewater</b> of <b>the</b> equalization tank, and (ii) IWWTP effluent. All <b>the</b> <b>wastewaters</b> were submitted to coagulation–flocculation tests {{with a wide range of}} biomass fly ashes dosage (expressed as Solid/Liquid – S/L – ratios).

For example, the definitive coagulation–flocculation assays performed over the IWWTP effluent presented a very low concentration of Pb (0. 35 mg/L) for the S/L ratio of 1. 23 g/L.

40|$|The {{treatability}} of a {{high strength}} industrial wastewater, 9, 000 mg/L as chemical oxygen demand (COD), by three sequencing batch reactor (SBRs) systems operated under alternating redox environments: anaerobic/aerobic (ANA), anoxic/aerobic (ANX), and aerobic was investigated. A synthetic wastewater was modeled after a wastewater from an existing chemical processing facility. The largest component, hydroxypivaldehyde, was unavailable for the use in this research and was substituted by pivalic acid, {{both of which have}} a tertiary carbon. No significant degradation occurred in the anaerobic phase of operation; however, 55 - 65 % of the COD was removed during anoxic operation. Simultaneous removal of pivalic acid and acetic acid was seen in both the anoxic and aerobic reaction phases. The anoxic/aerobic SBR provided the best overall treatability of <b>the</b> synthetic <b>wastewater</b> based on: effluent quality, sludge characteristics and settling properties. The results suggested that anoxic/aerobic treatment schemes are a viable treatment alternative for industrial wastewaters containing high concentrations of organic acids, including acids with tertiary carbons. The treatability of the three alternating redox environments on <b>the</b> Industry's <b>wastewater</b> was also investigated. Again, no significant degradation of <b>the</b> industrial <b>wastewater</b> occurred during <b>the</b> anaerobic reaction phase.
