5|$|Once at war, Turkey joined Germany {{in taking}} aim at the {{opposing}} Entente Powers and their extensive empires in the Muslim world. Enver Pasha had the Sultan proclaim jihad. His hope was to provoke and aid a vast Muslim revolution, particularly in India. Translations of <b>the</b> <b>proclamation</b> were sent to Berlin for propaganda purposes, for distribution to Muslim troops of the Entente Powers. However, while widely heard, <b>the</b> <b>proclamation</b> {{did not have the}} intended effect of mobilising global Muslim opinion on behalf of Turkey or the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, {{the regime}} {{withdrew from the}} Treaty of Versailles and {{introduced}} the Nuremberg Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities. Germany also reacquired control of the Saar in 1935, remilitarized the Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938, annexed the Sudetenland in 1938 with the Munich Agreement and in direct violation of the agreement occupied Czechoslovakia with <b>the</b> <b>proclamation</b> of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in March 1939.|$|E
50|$|It is {{impossible}} to give a definitive list of countries which are affected by <b>the</b> <b>proclamations</b> listed below. <b>The</b> law ofsuccession of states allows for the de facto continuation of a treaty or agreement when a territory becomesindependent, and many of <b>the</b> <b>proclamations</b> had effect in former dependent territories.|$|R
50|$|As to the {{validity}} of <b>the</b> first <b>proclamation,</b> <b>the</b> court held that section 4, listed in both the first and <b>the</b> second <b>proclamation,</b> belonged to <b>the</b> cluster of the administrative amendments which were listed in <b>the</b> second <b>proclamation.</b> <b>The</b> effect of <b>the</b> first <b>proclamation</b> was literally to put into operation an arbitrary selection {{of one of the}} administrative amendments (section 4) and four of the substantive amendments (sections 6, 10, 11 and 12) made by the Amendment Act. Because it was based on an arbitrary selection, it followed that <b>the</b> first <b>proclamation</b> was objectively irrational. Under the doctrine of objective invalidity, <b>the</b> first <b>proclamation</b> was a nullity from the outset. It was invalid and void ab initio, and therefore had no effect in law. Furthermore, if <b>the</b> first <b>proclamation</b> remained in effect, it would create a number of legal and practical problems.|$|R

25|$|The Legislative Instruments Act 2003 {{required}} <b>the</b> <b>proclamations</b> {{of these}} flags to be lodged in a Federal Register. Due to an administrative oversight they were not, and <b>the</b> <b>proclamations</b> were automatically repealed.

5000|$|The {{court held}} further that the President could, {{on the facts}} of the present case, have {{lawfully}} withdrawn <b>the</b> first <b>proclamation</b> once he realised his mistake, as long as he did so in unambiguous terms, and before July 31. That was not, however, what had happened: The President had issued <b>the</b> second <b>proclamation</b> in which he purported to [...] "amend" [...] <b>the</b> invalid first <b>proclamation.</b> <b>The</b> President did not have the power to amend a nullity. Moreover, <b>the</b> second <b>proclamation</b> did not withdraw the first proclamation; nor, on the face of it, could the legal position with regard to the Amendment Act be determined. No commencement date was {{to be found in the}} text of <b>the</b> second <b>proclamation.</b> One had to rely on the doctrine of incorporation by reference and consider the text of <b>the</b> void first <b>proclamation</b> to give <b>the</b> second <b>proclamation</b> meaning. <b>The</b> second <b>proclamation</b> was thus unclear, inconsistent with the rule of law and invalid.|$|R

The {{inscription}} of <b>the</b> Later <b>Proclamation</b> is dated to year six of Akhenaten’s reign in the day 13 of the season of Peret, which corresponds with the one year anniversary of <b>the</b> Earlier <b>Proclamation,</b> and includes a “renewal of the oath” that appeared in <b>the</b> Earlier <b>Proclamation</b> regarding <b>the</b> location and permanence of the site. with some modifications to include more land, especially a swath of agricultural land in the cultivation on the western side of the river. Titulary of the god Aten is also given, along with a repetition of much of <b>the</b> Earlier <b>Proclamation.</b> <b>The</b> Later <b>Proclamation</b> includes a description of events that took place after the inscription of <b>the</b> Earlier <b>Proclamation,</b> such as a journey of the pharaoh to the southeastern crag of the site. <b>The</b> Later <b>Proclamation</b> also mentions six principal boundary stelae that delimit the site.|$|R
5|$|The {{participation}} {{of these two}} annual ceremonies are considered the least time-consuming part of the herald's roles. However at other times {{they are involved in}} some of the most important ceremonies concerning the life of the British monarch. After the death of a Sovereign the Accession Council (made up of Privy Councillors and other officers such as the Lord Mayor of London) meets at St. James's Palace to make a formal proclamation of the accession of the next Sovereign. The traditional method of publishing the council's proclamation recognising the new monarch is by way of it being physically read out. This task is assigned to the various members of the College by way of the Earl Marshal, who receives the text of <b>the</b> <b>proclamation</b> from the council in person. <b>The</b> <b>proclamation</b> is to be read at several locations in London. Traditionally the first reading is made from the Friary Court balcony at St James's Palace. Another reading and ceremony is held at the Temple Bar. There a detachment of heralds, accompanied by troops of the Royal Horse Guards, formally demand admission to the precinct of the City of London from the City Marshall and City remembrancer. The barrier, consisting of a silken rope (in place of the ancient bar) was then removed and the detachment would march forward to meet the Lord Mayor and City Sheriffs, where <b>the</b> <b>proclamation</b> would be read. Other readings by members of the College also occur at the corner of Chancery Lane, in Fleet Street, and at the Royal Exchange.|$|E

5|$|According to Ottfried Neubecker, the bey of Tunis {{also had}} his own flag. This flag was most likely a simple {{personal}} banner of the ruler, as it floated above the Bardo Palace, the Citadel of Tunis, on navy ships, {{and also in the}} center of the coat of arms in Tunisia. It was used at a number of public ceremonies—including at <b>the</b> <b>proclamation</b> of the Ottoman constitution on 21 March 1840—until the abolition of the Bey monarchy on 25 July 1957.|$|E

5|$|After {{the atomic}} bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and <b>the</b> <b>proclamation</b> of Indonesian {{independence}} in August 1945, the Japanese began {{withdrawing from the}} nascent republic. The Indonesian republican government, based in Jakarta and including Sukarno as president and Mohammad Hatta as vice president, began to take over infrastructure from the departing Japanese. By September 1945, however, allied British and Dutch forces had begun to enter the archipelago, hoping to reestablish the status quo ante. The British initially focused on Java and Sumatra and attempted to avoid armed confrontations with the Republican forces; the Dutch, meanwhile, spent the first months after the Japanese surrender reclaiming the eastern islands with help from Australia.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{collapse}} of the Russian Empire in 1917, the Armenian, Georgian, and Muslim leaders of the Caucasus united to create the Transcaucasian Federation in the winter of 1918. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk had drastic consequences for the Armenians: Turkish forces reoccupied Western Armenia. The federation lasted for only three months, eventually leading to <b>the</b> <b>proclamation</b> of the Republics of Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. The negotiators for Armenia were from the ARF.|$|E

5|$|By the 1960s, Southern Rhodesians' {{service on}} Britain's behalf in the World Wars, {{particularly}} the Second, {{was an integral}} part of the colony's national psyche. The territory had also latterly contributed to British counter-insurgency operations in Malaya, Aden and Cyprus, as well as Operation Vantage in Kuwait. The colonial government's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 was deliberately made on 11 November, Armistice Day, in an attempt to emphasise the territory's prior war record on Britain's behalf. <b>The</b> <b>proclamation</b> was signed at 11:00 local time, during the customary two-minute silence to remember the fallen.|$|E

5|$|Constantine was {{the first}} Roman emperor to convert to Christianity, and he played an {{influential}} role in <b>the</b> <b>proclamation</b> of the Edict of Milan in 313, which declared religious tolerance for Christianity in the Roman empire. He called the First Council of Nicaea in 325, at which the Nicene Creed was adopted by Christians. In military matters, the Roman army was reorganised to consist of mobile field units and garrison soldiers capable of countering internal threats and barbarian invasions. Constantine pursued successful campaigns against the tribes on the Roman frontiers—the Franks, the Alamanni, the Goths, and the Sarmatians—even resettling territories abandoned by his predecessors during the Crisis of the Third Century.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>proclamation</b> of independence, {{neither the}} Belgian nor the Congolese {{government}} intended the colonial social order to end immediately. The Belgian government hoped that whites might keep their position indefinitely. The Republic of the Congo was still reliant on colonial {{institutions like the}} Force Publique to function from day to day, and white technical experts, installed by the Belgians, were retained in the broad absence of suitably qualified black Congolese replacements (partly the result of colonial restrictions regarding higher education). Many Congolese people had assumed that independence would produce tangible and immediate social change, so the retention of whites in positions of importance was widely resented.|$|E
