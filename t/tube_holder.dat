The vacuum in the tube then automatically draws the needed blood directly from the patient's vein. Multiple vacuum tubes can be attached to and removed in turn from a single needle, allowing multiple samples to be obtained from a single procedure. This is possible due to the multiple sample sleeve, which is a flexible rubber fitting over the posterior end of the needle cannula which seals the needle until it is pushed out of the way. This keeps blood from freely draining out of the back of the needle inserted in the patient's vein, as each test tube is removed and the next impaled. Safety regulations require that needles come equipped with a sheath or safety device to cover the needle after the procedure to prevent accidental needle stick injury.|$|E

In recent years, many rapid detection {{methods have been}} reported, {{but most of them}} are still in lab research and not practical for use in the field. In this study, a portable and automatic biosensing instrument was designed and constructed for separation and detection of target pathogens in food samples using nanobead-based magnetic separation and quantum dots (QDs) -labeled fluorescence measurement. The instrument consisted of a laptop with LabVIEW software, a data acquisition card (DAQ), a fluorescent detector, micro-pumps, stepper motors, and 3 D printed <b>tube</b> <b>holders.</b> First, a sample in a syringe was mixed with magnetic nanobead-antibody (MNB-Ab) conjugates and then injected to a low binding reaction tube. After incubation and magnetic separation, target bacterial cells were captured and collected and the solution was pumped out. Then the QD-antibody (QD-Ab) conjugates were pumped into the reaction tube to form the MNB-Ab-cell-Ab-QD complexes that were then collected by magnetic separation and resuspended in PBS buffer solution through air pressure control. Finally, the sample solution was pushed into the detection tube by an air pump and the fluorescence intensity was measured using a fluorescent detector. A virtual instrument (VI) was programmed using LabVIEW software to provide a platform for magnetic separation, fluorescent measurement, data processing, and control. The DAQ was used for data communication. The results showed that the separation efficiency of this instrument was 78. 3 ± 3. 4 % and 60. 7 ± 4. 2 % for E. coli O 157 :H 7 in pure culture and ground beef samples, respectively. The limit of detection was 3. 98 × 103 and 6. 46 × 104 CFU/mL in pure culture and ground beef samples, respectively. Sample preparation and detection could be finished in 2 hours.

Urine samples containing {{one of the}} five solvents (acetone, methanol, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and toluene) at the levels of biological exposure limits were aspirated into a vacuum <b>tube</b> via <b>holder,</b> a device commercially available for venous blood collection (the vacuum tube method). The urine sample, 5 ml, was quantitatively transferred to a 20 -ml head-space vial prior to HS-GC analysis. The loaded tubes were stored at + 4 °C in dark for up to 3 d. The vacuum tube method facilitated on-site procedures of urine sample preparation for HS-GC with no significant loss of solvents in the sample and no need of skilled hands, whereas on-site sample preparation time was significantly reduced. Furthermore, no loss of solvents was detected during the 3 -d storage, irrespective of hydrophilic (acetone) or lipophilic solvent (toluene). In a pilot application, high performance of the vacuum tube method in sealing a sample in an air-tight space succeeded to confirm that no solvent will be lost when sealing is completed within 5 min after urine voiding, and that the allowance time is as long as 30 min in case of toluene in urine. The use of the holder-vacuum tube device not only saves hands for transfer of the sample to air-tight space, but facilitates sample storage prior to HS-GC analysis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe use of slab-like flat {{specimens}} for electron cryo-tomography {{restricts the}} range of viewing angles that can be used. This leads to the “missing wedge” problem, which causes artefacts and anisotropic resolution in reconstructed tomograms. Cylindrical specimens provide a way to eliminate the problem, since they allow imaging from {{a full range of}} viewing angles around the tilt axis. Such specimens have been used before for tomography of radiation-insensitive samples at room temperature, but never for frozen-hydrated specimens. Here, we demonstrate the use of thin-walled carbon <b>tubes</b> as specimen <b>holders,</b> allowing the preparation of cylindrical frozen-hydrated samples of ribosomes, liposomes and whole bacterial cells. Images acquired from these cylinders have equal quality at all viewing angles, and the accessible tilt range is restricted only by the physical limits of the microscope.

The overall quality of these tomograms is still lower than that obtained by existing methods, but improvements are likely in future...|$|R

We present a 50 -year-old male patient with tetraplegia who had long-term urethral catheter drainage. Following flexible cystoscopy, he developed a urine leak from {{the right side of}} the scrotum. Suprapubic cystostomy was performed. After suprapubic cystostomy, the urinary fistula healed completely. A follow-up cystourethrogram confirmed an intact urethra with no leak of contrast. Six weeks later, this patient presented with a hole below the suprapubic cystostomy through which a small amount of urine was leaking. A keyhole dressing had been applied around the suprapubic catheter and the catheter was hanging loosely, thus permitting traction on the catheter, especially when the urine bag was full. Computerised tomography of the pelvis showed extrusion of the Foley balloon from the urinary bladder, but the tip of the catheter was still located within the bladder. The extruded catheter was removed and a Foley catheter was inserted, ensuring that the balloon was inflated within the urinary bladder.

After adjusting the angle of the glass tube so as to make the specimen’s orientation marker line vertical using a laser level (Fig.  2), the collet is tightened to fix the specimen to the spinning axis. The specimen’s marker can be adjusted within a few degrees from the vertical. Fixing the glass tube with the collet reduces wobbling during spinning and enables precise orientation of the specimen.|$|E

40|$|What {{are some}} of the {{incorrect}} practices that have resulted in transmission of pathogens? Practices that have resulted in transmission of HCV and/or HBV include the following: • Using the same syringe to administer medication to more than one patient, even if the needle was changed; • Using the same medication vial for more than one patient, and accessing the vial with a syringe that has already been used to administer medication to a patient; • Using a common bag of saline or other intravenous fluid for more than one patient, and accessing the bag with a syringe that has already been used to flush a patient’s catheter. Can some of these incorrect practices also result in transmission of bacterial infections? YES. These incorrect practices put patients at risk for bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. How should a health care provider prepare medications? Parenteral medications should be accessed in an aseptic manner. This includes using a new sterile syringe and needle to draw up medications while preventing contact between the injection materials and the non-sterile environment. Proper hand hygiene should be performed before handling medications and, if a medication vial has already been opened, the rubber septum should be disinfected with alcohol or other approved antiseptic prior to piercing. Where should a health care provider prepare medications? Medications should be prepared in a designated “clean ” medication area that is not adjacent to areas where potentially contaminated items are placed. Examples of contaminated items that should not be placed in or near the medication preparation area include: used equipment such as syringes, needles, intravenous tubing, blood collection <b>tubes,</b> needle <b>holders</b> (e. g., Vacutainer holder), or other soiled equipment or materials that have been used in a procedure.

One of the non-invasive methods of such detection based on the Oblique- Incidence Diffuse Reflectance (OIDR) measurements of the reflected diode laser light from the skin. In this research we designed and implemented the OIDR reflectometry measuring system with a 650 [*] nm diode laser source to aid physicians in diagnosing both squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and basal cell carcinomas(BCC). Method The laser is delivered obliquely to the skin surface by an optical fiber fitted through a <b>tube</b> <b>holder</b> of CCD camera. The diffused reflected laser light from the skin is captured by the CCD camera and sent to a computer, which is supplied by a specially prepared Matlab program to analyze these images in order to decide in a time whether the lesion is malignant or benign.

40|$|The ‘missing wedge’ is {{a long-standing}} problem in {{electron}} tomography, {{caused by the}} use of slab-like flat specimens, which increase in thickness when tilted to high angles. Attempts have been made to reduce the undesirable effects caused by the missing wedge, but the problem remains, particularly for the radiation-sensitive frozen-hydrated specimens used for high resolution imaging. Specimens with cylindrical symmetry offer a way to overcome this problem, since the thickness remains constant at all viewing angles. However, while this has been suggested before, it has never been demonstrated for frozen-hydrated specimens. In this work, I present a way to make cylindrical specimens for electron cryo-tomography, using thin-walled carbon <b>tubes</b> as specimen <b>holders.</b> The <b>tubes</b> are made in a multi-step process, involving carbon deposition on glass micropipette templates and subsequent removal of the glass. Tube diameters are typically a few hundred nanometres, with a wall thickness of 10 – 20 nm. To make frozen-hydrated specimens, the tubes are filled with an aqueous sample and then plunge-frozen in liquid ethane. Electron images acquired from the tubes have equal quality at all viewing angles, with a tilt range restricted only by the physical limits of the microscope. Tomograms from specimens such as gold particles and liposomes show that the effects of the missing wedge are substantially reduced, with much improved resolution along the electron beam axis. Structural features oriented in all directions are visible in the reconstructions, in marked contrast to tomograms acquired over a more restricted angular range. These results are promising, however some technical challenges remain before this method can be used routinely. This work was supported by a Medical Research Council PhD Studentshi...|$|R
40|$|When {{exposed to}} them, {{isocyanates}} can induce serious {{injuries in the}} respiratory tract and irritation on the skin and in the eyes. They are therefore interesting {{from the point of}} view of occupational health. The purpose of this thesis was to collect isocyanates in air with impinger-filter samplers and solvent free samplers. Furthermore the isocyanates were to be analyzed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The solvent free sampler consists of a polypropylene <b>tube</b> and filter <b>holder</b> fitted with glass fiber filters impregnated with derivatization reagent, coupled with a pump. The impinger-filter sampler was made out of an impinger flask, containing a derivatization solution, coupled in series with a filter holder and a pump. Di-n-butylamine was used as derivatization reagent in both samplers to stabilize the reactive isocyanates and to enable mass spectrometric detection. The solvent free sampler is highly advantageous because of its user friendliness during field measurements, as opposed to the impinger-filter method. An exposure chamber, equipped with two interior fans to ensure good circulation, was used to generate an atmosphere containing isocyanates. Analyzing the isocyanate-DBA derivates with LC-MS/MS worked very well and the method made it possible to detect isocyanate levels below 1 ng/mL. During quantification of isocyanates a standard curve with concentrations from 1 to 1000 ng/mL was used. Detection of isocyanate levels as low as one fifth of the limit value of some isocyanates was found to be possible, which would indicate that the methods are sensitive. Even though the solvent free sampler worked, the impinger-filter sampler was found to be more effective in collecting isocyanates. The coefficient of variation calculated from concentrations of isocyanates from the solvent free sampler varied between 0 - 35 %. The reason for this might be due to the fact that an optimized extraction method had not been tried out within the time limit of this project. Questions, identified during this thesis work, need to be answered before being able to obtain reliable results from field measurements with the solvent free sampler...|$|R

The rate of ascending temperature was regularly 5 ℃/min. during the analysis. The DTA curves (Fig. 3) of pyrite show a large endothermic reaction beginning at 690 ℃ or 722 ℃ at which phase change from pyrite to pyrrhotite occurs. The curves (Fig. 4) of natural pyrrhotite present two endothermic peaks which correspond to γ-type magnetic anomaly and β-type magnetic transformation at 240 ℃ and 320 ℃ respectively. The β transformation of monoclinic pyrrhotite requires more large amount of the latent heat than that of hexagonal pyrrhotite. The DTA curves (Fig. 8) of covellite by both methods of the evacuated silica tube and nitrogen atmosphere show a strong endothermic reaction beginning at 508 ℃ and 475 ℃ respectively. It seems to indicate formation of digenite by dissociation of covellite. The curves (Fig. 9) of chalcocite also show large and small endothermic peaks beginning at temperature from 100 ℃ to 105 ℃ and at temperature from 400 ℃ to 460 ℃, corresponding to two transitions from orthorhombic to hexagonal form and from hexagonal to cubic form respectively. The curves (Fig. 10) of chalcopyrite have a distinct endothermic peak which seems to represent the latent heat of transformation from α-form of tetragonal lattice to γ-form of cubic face centered lattice, beginning at 554 ℃ (evacuated silica tube) or 540 ℃ (nitrogen atmosphere). The curves (Fig. 11) of bornite indicate an endothermic reaction with two steps at approximate 200 ℃ and 270 ℃. It is considered to represent the high-low inversion of bornite polymorphism. Cubanite is also found to transform from low temperature form to high temperature form by the DTA curves (Fig. 12) showing a distinct endothermic peak beginning at 254 °± 3 ℃. In the case of the reaction accompanied with dissociation of sulfur, the reaction temperature obtained by both methods differs. Namely such an endothermic reaction in the nitrogen atmosphere occurs at lower temperature than that of the means using the evacuated silica tube method...|$|R
