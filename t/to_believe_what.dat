5|$|In May 1944, it was {{announced}} that broadcast performers must organize themselves into a union, and that this union would be the only one permitted to operate in Argentina. Shortly after the union formed, Eva Duarte was elected its president. Fraser and Navarro speculate that Juan Perón made the suggestion that performers create a union, and the other performers likely felt it was good politics to elect his mistress. Shortly after her election as president of the union, Eva Duarte began a daily program called Toward a Better Future, which dramatized in soap opera form the accomplishments of Juan Perón. Often, Perón's own speeches were played during the program. When she spoke, Eva Duarte spoke in ordinary language as a regular woman who wanted listeners <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> she herself believed about Juan Perón.|$|E

25|$|By the 19th century, {{the liberals}} had evolved into Unitarians. Not {{only did they}} deny the {{doctrine}} of the Trinity as unscriptural, they believed the Bible should be interpreted rationally, not in a literal manner. Their preaching focused on ethics rather than on doctrine and did not limit church membership to the converted. Unitarians did not participate in evangelistic societies due to their conviction that people informed by reason and scripture should be free <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> they wanted. When they did organize, they tended to focus on education and philanthropic causes.|$|E

[...] "It was hard <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> we saw", Tibbets told reporters, while Parsons said [...] "the whole thing was tremendous and awe-inspiring ... the men aboard with me gasped 'My God'".

500|$|While at university, {{he became}} an {{agnostic}} and later an aggressive atheist; he was sceptical of religious faith, which he regarded as [...] "an effort <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> common sense tells you isn't true." [...] He was also disgusted by what he regarded as hypocritical conduct by religious adherents. Towards the later years of his undergraduate years, his unhappiness with religion began to dog him to a greater extent. He tried to become involved with communism for brief period but then resolved to devote himself to scientific research. The length of time required to study medicine {{had been reduced to}} five years to train doctors faster following the outbreak of World War I, and Burnet graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and a Bachelor of Surgery in 1922, ranking second in the final exams despite {{the death of his father}} a few weeks earlier.

500|$|... "731" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Writing for The A.V. Club, reviewer Zack Handlen rated the episode an A, calling it [...] "terrific". However, Handlen {{felt that the}} version of events told to Scully in this episode was perhaps a better explanation for the series' mythology than its eventual resolution, noting {{that it might have}} offered [...] "a conclusion whose emotional impact would've lived up to the intensity of early mythology episodes" [...] such as this. In a retrospective of the third season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "731" [...] was rated a B. The review noted that the episode was [...] "strangely tension-free", though it derided Scully's stubbornness <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> the series had established as truth. Nick De Semlyen and James White of Empire named it the second [...] "greatest" [...] episode of the series, stating it is [...] "arguably the greatest of The X-Files' many mythology episodes" [...] and a [...] "high-octane mix of action and intrigue, with the production values and pacing of a Hollywood blockbuster".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{an ensemble}} {{of family and}} friends of Gwen and Rhys previously unseen in the series. William Thomas and Sharon Morgan were cast as Gwen's parents Geraint and Mary Cooper. Davies re-introduced the characters during the fourth series of the show, considering Thomas and Morgan to be [...] "two fine Welsh actors". Thomas had previously appeared as two different characters in the 1988 Doctor Who serial Remembrance of the Daleks and the 2005 Doctor Who episode [...] "Boom Town". Upon appearing in [...] "Something Borrowed" [...] he became the first actor to have appeared in all three of the classic series, new series and Torchwood. Nerys Hughes played Rhys' mother Brenda Williams, in addition to a duplicate form of the alien Nostrovite. Like Thomas she had previously appeared in a Doctor Who serial (the 1982 story Kinda). Hughes enjoyed getting to play a [...] "monster" [...] {{for the first time in}} her career which involved having [...] "fangs and claws and red eyes" [...] and being wired up so [...] "all this black blood can ooze out when I get shot". Despite the funny aspect of the script Hughes took the role seriously stating that [...] "everyone plays it for real" [...] and that [...] "you can't camp it up". She believed that as an actor [...] "you've got <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> you're doing".|$|E

Wheeler told Allison Maund from Inside Soap that Nicola calls Ivan for [...] "some comfort" [...] and they get drunk and [...] "very cosy"; but Ivan presumes they are just good friends. Ivan {{gets out of the}} shower wearing a towel and is confronted with Nicola [...] "dressed in her sexiest underwear". Ivan tells Nicola to stop because he loves Paul, but Simon's mother Lesley Meredith (Sherrie Hewson) walks in on them and assumes that they are having an affair. Nicola does not correct Lesley and tells her <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> she likes and then Paul learns of the situation. Wheeler said that Nicola realises she cannot [...] "get out of the lie now" [...] and even tells her father, Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower) that she has slept with Ivan. The actress added that [...] "Nicola's just quite pleased with the fact that she's got her own back on Ivan". He confronts her in public and asks her to tell the truth, but she [...] "turns on the waterworks" [...] to get everyone to turn against Ivan. Later Nicola argues with Paul and she tells him that she and Ivan have slept together many times. Wheeler said that Nicola just thinks [...] "Sod it, I'm going to leave them all stewing". Her lies ruin Ivan's relationship with Paul, who believes Nicola's lies.|$|E

500|$|Davis gained {{international}} attention after her refusal to issue marriage licenses {{and the ensuing}} controversy her actions caused. Many legal experts asserted that Davis had no standing under the law to refuse to issue the licenses. Columbia Law School professor Katherine Franke said, [...] "Kim Davis has all sorts of religious liberty rights secured under the First Amendment and under other laws, {{but they are not}} at stake in this case. All she's asked to do with couples that come before her is certify that they've met the state requirements for marriage, so her religious opposition to same-sex marriage is absolutely irrelevant." [...] Professor Stephen Vladeck of American University's Washington College of Law said that Davis [...] "waived any right to have an objection to issuing same-sex marriage licenses when she ran for the job". Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin and others compared Davis' refusal to follow orders of the U.S. Supreme Court to Alabama Governor George Wallace's futile [...] "Stand in the Schoolhouse Door" [...] protest of desegregation in 1963. The Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT civil rights group, said, [...] "Ms. Davis has the fundamental right <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> she likes... but as a public servant, she does {{not have the right to}} pick and choose which laws she will follow or which services she will provide." [...] Attorney and author Roberta A. Kaplan, who argued for the plaintiffs in United States v. Windsor, wrote that [...] "Kim Davis is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate, yet she swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. It is laughable that she can then decide which laws to enforce, which is why every decision in her case has gone against her." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{team found}} it {{difficult}} to fill the remaining places in the company with Asian performers, especially in the chorus. [...] Four other shows with Asian themes had opened or were in rehearsal in New York, and the demand for the few Asian actors was strong. [...] Kelly and the show's choreographer, Carol Haney, journeyed to cities across the country to seek out talent. [...] Agents were sent to other cities; in Honolulu, they found nightclub singer and native Hawaiian Ed Kenney, who would originate Wang Ta. [...] Meanwhile, in New York, the three producers were visiting dance schools. [...] An advertisement in New York Chinatown newspapers received one response. [...] No formal audition was held in San Francisco's Chinatown, and the only find was Forbidden City nightclub comedian Goro [...] "Jack" [...] Suzuki (who soon changed his name to Jack Soo), who was cast as Frankie Wing, comedian at Sammy Fong's Celestial Bar. [...] The role of Fong proved difficult to cast. [...] Initially, it was given to Larry Storch, a nightclub comic, but during the Boston tryouts, it was given to another Caucasian, Larry Blyden, who was married to Carol Haney, the show's choreographer. [...] The role of Madam Liang, Master Wang's sister-in-law, fell to Juanita Hall, a light-skinned African American who had played a Tonkinese (Vietnamese) woman, Bloody Mary, in South Pacific. Another African-American performer, Diahann Carroll, was considered for the cast but not hired. [...] Rodgers later wrote, [...] "what was important was that the actors gave the illusion of being Chinese. [...] This demonstrates one of the most wonderful things about theatre audiences. [...] People want <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> they see on a stage, and they will gladly go along with whatever is done to achieve the desired effect.

[...] In fact, Einstein apparently once visited Hubble and tried {{to convince him that}} the universe was expanding. Hubble also discovered the asteroid 1373 Cincinnati on August 30, 1935.

The connection to religious belief is left unexplained throughout, except for the close of his discussion where Hume notes the reliance of Christianity upon testimony of miraculous occurrences. He makes an ironic remark that anyone who [...] "is moved by faith to assent" [...] to revealed testimony [...] "is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person, which subverts all principles of his understanding, and gives him a determination <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> is most contrary to custom and experience."

2500|$|Freedom of {{religion}} and {{separation of church and}} state have formed part of the French idea of the state since at least the French Revolution and in some ways long before, since the 16th century period of the Reformation and of the Wars of Religion. Separation {{of religion}} and state in France takes the form of laïcité, by which political power avoids interference in the sphere of religious dogma, and religion avoids interference in public policies. The French understand [...] "freedom of religion" [...] primarily as the freedom of the individual to believe or not <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> any religion teaches. Also, because of a long history of one single dominating church (the Catholic Church), the French state sees its duty less in protecting religion from state interference than in protecting the individual from interference by religion.|$|E
