50|$|On November 19, 2004, Perfect 10 {{filed suit}} against Google, asserting various {{copyright}} and trademark infringement claims, including direct, contributory, and vicarious copyright infringement. After settlement discussions lasting several months, Perfect 10 filed for a preliminary injunction that would require Google to cease linking to and distributing its images.

25|$|Baron de Montesquieu wrote {{a series}} of highly {{influential}} works in the early 18th century, including Persian letters (1717) and The Spirit of the Laws (1748). The latter exerted tremendous influence, {{both inside and outside}} France. Montesquieu pleaded in favor of a constitutional system of government, the preservation of civil liberties and the law, and the idea that political institutions ought to reflect the social and geographical aspects of each community. In particular, he argued that political liberty required the separation of the powers of government. Building on John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, he advocated that the executive, legislative, and judicial functions of government should be assigned to different bodies, so that attempts by one branch of government <b>to</b> <b>infringe</b> on political liberty might be restrained by the other branches. In a lengthy discussion of the English political system, which he greatly admired, he tried to show how this might be achieved and liberty secured, even in a monarchy. He also notes that liberty cannot be secure where there is no separation of powers, even in a republic. He also emphasized the importance of a robust due process in law, including the right to a fair trial, the presumption of innocence and proportionality in the severity of punishment.|$|E

25|$|The British army uniform had red jackets or {{doublets}} as a colour {{having been}} established during the Elizabethan times. By the 1660s red {{had become the}} predominant colour in British uniforms since {{the creation of the}} New Model Army in 1645. The regiment of infantry or horse was usually just designated as a regiment number, and not by the name of the colonel as was custom at the time. The first colonel was Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin, who also commanded the British Brigade in the early stages. In 1662 he was succeeded, by the Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg in 1663 who was sent as military adviser to Lisbon with the secret approval of Charles II. Louis XIV of France, in order not <b>to</b> <b>infringe</b> the treaty just made with Spain, deprived Schomberg of his French officers. In the field, however, the regiment was commanded by Michael Dongan, later by Lawrence Dempsey and finally by Frederick's son Meinhardt Schomberg. The first infantry regiment was commanded by Henry Pearson while the second infantry regiment was commanded by James Apsley as colonel, and also Francis Moore as acting colonel. In 1665 the 2nd regiment was commanded by William Sheldon.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} whether Douds remains good case law. The Supreme Court {{distinguished}} the case but declined to overrule Douds in Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494 (1951). In 1965, in United States v. Brown, 381 U.S. 437 (1965), the Supreme Court essentially overturned Douds by holding that the Taft-Hartley Act's oath constituted a bill of attainder, but did not formally do so. Two years later, in United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258 (1967), the Court specifically declined to apply a balancing test to a law prohibiting members of the Communist Party from holding jobs in the defense industry. Although the law was based on the same rationale as Taft-Hartley (that membership in the Communist Party was a sure indication of future action), the Supreme Court said this was too heavy an infringement on the individual's First Amendment rights. Instead, the Court seemed to suggest a new, two-part test: Whether the governmental interests advanced are valid, and whether the statute is narrowly drawn <b>to</b> <b>infringe</b> on First Amendment rights in the most narrow way. The Court returned to the balancing test in Brandenberg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), but this time concluded that prohibiting mere advocacy of violence was too heavy a burden on the First Amendment. Such advocacy must produce imminent action for the speech to be punishable, the Court held.|$|E
500|$|The Court of Common Pleas, {{along with}} the other {{superior}} courts, sat in Westminster Hall from its creation. Due to the provisions in Magna Carta, it was bound to sit there; an apocryphal story says that Orlando Bridgeman refused to move the court a few feet to avoid the draught from the north entrance, fearing that to do so would be <b>to</b> <b>infringe</b> on Magna Carta.

500|$|Initially, {{the federal}} {{government}} honored its treaties with the tribes, but with increasing numbers of white settlers moving into the area, the settlers began <b>to</b> <b>infringe</b> upon the fishing rights of the native tribes. [...] By 1883, whites had established more than forty salmon canneries. [...] In 1894, there were three canneries in the Puget Sound area; by 1905 there were twenty-four. The whites also began to use new techniques that prevented {{a significant portion of}} the salmon from reaching the tribal fishing areas. When Washington Territory became a state in 1889, the legislature passed [...] "laws to curtail tribal fishing in the name of 'conservation' but what some scholars described as being designed to protect white fisheries". The state legislature, by 1897, had banned the use of weirs, which were customarily used by Indians. The tribes turned to the courts for enforcement of their rights under the treaties.|$|E
500|$|The Mathews test {{employed}} {{consists of}} three considerations: the private interests affected, the risk posed by erroneous judgement, and the government interest affected. The Court found that private interests were substantially affected by the law noting that [...] "hen the State initiates a parental rights termination proceeding, it seeks not merely <b>to</b> <b>infringe</b> that fundamental liberty interest, but to end it" [...] and that such a termination was irreversible. In analyzing the second factor, the Court stated that {{the interests of the}} parents and the child in their natural relationship are not distinct and thus the balancing factors are between the parents and the State. The Court then found that the [...] "fair preponderance" [...] burden did not fairly allocate risk and that a higher burden would be practically and symbolically important. The Court found that while the State had an interest, a higher burden would have little impact on the ability for the State to achieve its goal. Following from this review, the Court held that [...] "the State [...] support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{publicity}} {{stemming from}} this incident was {{the impetus for}} Google contributing to the Chilling Effects archive, which archives legal threats of all sorts made against Internet users and Internet sites.

5000|$|Furthermore, {{the court}} held that MP3tunes' ability to monitor use or {{terminate}} accounts is merely an ability to control its own system, and not an ability to control infringement arising from users' activities and decisions. It further held that as a safe harbor, MP3tunes is not required to monitor use or prevent infringement; mere linking <b>to</b> <b>infringing</b> content, regardless of whether the links are user-supplied, doesn't create liability, at least not for what is otherwise a safe harbor: [...] "If enabling a party <b>to</b> download <b>infringing</b> material was sufficient to create liability, then even search engines like Google or Yahoo! would be without DMCA protection. In that case, the DMCA's purposeâ€”innovation and growth of internet servicesâ€”would be undermined." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, The Circuit {{held that}} [...] "right and ability <b>to</b> control" [...] <b>infringing</b> {{activity}} must logically encompass more than [...] "the mere ability to delete and block access <b>to</b> <b>infringing</b> material" [...] because Â§512(c) presumes such ability by service providers in requiring {{for them to}} removal of such material, and therefore must include another factor. [...] Although it was left ambiguous what this additional factor may look like in the original 2011 Ninth Court opinion , the 2013 update [...] added a citation agreeing with the Second Circuit's ruling in Viacom v.
