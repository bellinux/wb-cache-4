5|$|In {{an effort}} to cut costs, the Kentucky State Police {{announced}} in May 2009 that it would only offer the state driving test in English beginning June 1, 2009. The test had previously been offered in 22 foreign languages, but the state police said that the foreign language versions of the test had not been updated to reflect recent changes to driving laws. Two days later, Beshear announced the reversal of the state police's new policy, saying he was not informed of it and believed it was <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> He promised the foreign language versions of the test would be updated and {{would continue to be}} offered.|$|E
5|$|The series {{focuses on}} the adventures of the dark-haired Valérian, a spatio-temporal agent, and his redheaded female colleague, Laureline, as they travel the {{universe}} through space and time. Valérian is a classical hero, kind, strong and brave who follows the orders of his superiors even if he feels, deep down, that it is <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> On the other hand, his partner Laureline combines her superior intelligence, determination and independence with sex-appeal. Influenced by classic literary science fiction, the series mixes space opera with time travel plots. Christin's scripts are noted for their humour, complexity and strongly humanist and left-wing liberal political ideas while Mézières' art is characterized by its vivid depictions of the alien worlds and species Valérian and Laureline encounter on their adventures. The series is considered a landmark in European comics and pop culture, and influenced other media as well: traces of its concepts, storylines and designs {{can be found in}} science fiction films such as Star Wars and The Fifth Element.|$|E
500|$|Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Johnson {{was raised}} as the {{youngest}} of three siblings. Johnson began fighting {{at the age of}} 10, after his father's fatal heart attack. The incident made Johnson want to exert his anger physically. Johnson later said, [...] "I lost something, a huge part of me....Fighting was my way of not dealing with my dad's passing. Now that I think of it, of course, it was <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> especially putting all that burden on my mom having to deal with it." [...] Athletic, Johnson was a three-sport varsity athlete at Marquette High School in Chesterfield, Missouri. Johnson later received a full scholarship to play football at Central Methodist University, but transferred after one year to Meramec Community College where {{he was one of the}} top NJCAA wrestlers in the country.|$|E

5000|$|De Mauro’s {{disappearance}} {{and likely}} death {{remains one of}} the unsolved mysteries in Italian history.

[...] According to Blunt, who did not add the rider to the bill but who supported it, [...] "What it says is if you plant a crop that is legal to plant when you plant it, you get to harvest it". He later led Senate Republicans in defeating an amendment by Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley to repeal the provision. Blunt claimed all the amendment did [...] "was repeat [...] authority that the secretary in a hearing the other day, before the Agri Approp committee the other day, said he already had. And it didn't require the secretary to do anything that the secretary thought was <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Which {{is one of the reasons}} I thought it was fine..." ...|$|E

Danny had learned, when a very tiny fellow, that there the only safe thing to do when danger was near was to sit perfectly still and hardly breathe.|$|E
60|$|It was a madness, but {{she refused}} to {{consider}} the madness. She was no longer herself but a woman, with a woman's clinging need; and though she leaned ever so lightly, the need seemed satisfied. She was no longer tired. Martin did not speak. Had he, the spell would have been broken. But his reticence of love prolonged it. He was dazed and dizzy. He could not understand what was happening. It was too wonderful {{to be anything but}} a delirium. He conquered a mad desire to let go sheet and tiller and to clasp her in his arms. His intuition told him it was <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and he was glad that sheet and tiller kept his hands occupied and fended off temptation. But he luffed the boat less delicately, spilling the wind shamelessly from the sail so as to prolong the tack to the north shore. The shore would compel him to go about, and the contact would be broken. He sailed with skill, stopping way on the boat without exciting the notice of the wranglers, and mentally forgiving his hardest voyages in that they had made this marvellous night possible, giving him mastery over sea and boat and wind so that he could sail with her beside him, her dear weight against him on his shoulder.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} moral relativism, {{most people would}} {{agree that it is}} {{ethically}} wrong to use wealth to control a situation and to ‘force’ people into renegotiating clauses in contracts if they are unable to afford the legal bill accompanying a dispute. However, as moral relativism is subject to a one’s own beliefs on what is right and wrong, some may not view using wealth as a means to control as being <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> In situations such as these, the ‘little man’ usually loses out and will ultimately succumb {{to the power of the}} other party or parties.|$|E

50|$|Minimum cut {{partitioning}} however fails {{when the}} number of communities to be partitioned, or the partition sizes are unknown. For instance, optimizing the cut size for free group sizes puts all vertices in the same community.

This motivated the use of Modularity (Q) as a metric to optimize a balanced graph partition.
