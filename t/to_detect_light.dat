5|$|Most insects, except {{some species}} of cave crickets, {{are able to}} {{perceive}} light and dark. Many species have acute vision capable of detecting minute movements. The eyes may include simple eyes or ocelli as well as compound eyes of varying sizes. Many species are able <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>light</b> in the infrared, ultraviolet and the visible light wavelengths. Color vision has been demonstrated in many species and phylogenetic analysis suggests that UV-green-blue trichromacy existed from at least the Devonian period between 416 and 359 million years ago.|$|E
500|$|... "Light gun shooters", [...] "light gun games" [...] or [...] "gun games" [...] are {{games in}} which the protagonist shoots at targets, whether antagonists or objects, and which utilize a gun-shaped {{controller}} (termed a [...] "light gun") with which the player aims. While light gun games may feature a first-person perspective, they are distinct from first person shooters, which utilize more conventional input devices. Light gun games which feature [...] "on-rails" [...] movement are sometimes termed [...] "rail shooters", though this term is also applied to other types of shooters featuring similar movement. The light gun itself is so termed because it functions {{through the use of}} a light sensor: pulling the trigger allows it <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>light</b> from the on-screen targets.|$|E

50|$|Another theory {{posits that}} since stars {{typically}} emit light with shorter wavelengths, {{the light from}} stars {{will be in the}} blue-green color spectrum. Therefore, using red light to navigate would not desensitize the receptors used <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> star <b>light.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Leptothorax acervorum is a {{small red}} ant [...] Similar to other ants, L. acercorum {{displays}} elbowed-antennae, metapleural glands, and a constriction of the second abdominal segment. The exoskeleton provides a protecting casing of the body, which {{can be divided into}} 3 segments: the head, mesosoma, and metasoma. [...] The head contains eyes that detect acute movement, three small ocelli <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>light</b> and polarization, and two mandibles. [...] Attached to the head are two antennae. All six legs are attached to the mesosoma. [...] The metasoma houses vital internal organs. “The pedicel of the metasoma is two-segmented,” which is unique for the Subfamily Myrmicinae. [...] The head and abdomen are dark, thereby giving the ant a two-toned appearance. [...] Individual ants are small, with workers measuring around [...] in length and queens being only 10% larger. [...] Colonies are small compared to those of other ants—they have anywhere from a few dozen to a few hundred workers and one to several queens.|$|E
2500|$|The word {{observable}} used in {{this sense}} does not refer to the capability of modern technology <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>light</b> or other information from an object, or whether there is anything to be detected. It refers to the physical limit created by {{the speed of light}} itself. [...] Because no signals can travel faster than light, any object further away from us than light could travel {{in the age of the}} universe (estimated [...] around [...] years) simply cannot be detected, as they have not reached us yet. In practice, the limit on observation is not 13.799 billion light-years for two reasons. The first reason is that space itself is expanding, so we can actually detect light from objects that were once close, but are now up to around 45.7 billion light years away (rather than up to 13.799 billion light years away as might be expected). The second reason is that before the recombination epoch, about 378,000 years after the Big Bang, the Universe was filled with a plasma that was opaque to light, and photons were quickly re-absorbed by other particles, so we cannot see objects from before that time using light or any other electromagnetic radiation. Gravitational waves and neutrino background would have been unaffected by this, and may be detectable from earlier times.|$|E
50|$|X-ray photons scatter by {{interaction}} with the electron cloud of the material, neutrons are scattered by the nuclei. This means that, {{in the presence of}} heavy atoms with many electrons, it may be difficult <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>light</b> atoms by X-ray diffraction. In contrast, the neutron scattering lengths of most atoms are approximately equal in magnitude. Neutron diffraction techniques may therefore be used <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>light</b> elements such as oxygen or hydrogen in combination with heavy atoms. The neutron diffraction technique therefore has obvious applications to problems such as determining oxygen displacements in materials like high temperature superconductors and ferroelectrics, or to hydrogen bonding in biological systems.|$|E

50|$|Current systems usually use photosensors {{mounted in}} the {{rear-view}} mirror <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>light</b> and dim the mirror by means of electrochromism. This electrochromic feature has also been incorporated into side-view mirrors allowing them to dim and reduce glare as well.|$|E

5000|$|Slugs use {{two pairs}} of tentacles to sense their environment. The larger, upper pair, termed [...] "eyestalks," [...] are used <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>light</b> or movement. The second, lower pair are used to detect chemicals. The tentacles can retract and extend {{themselves}} to avoid damage.If a predator bites off a tentacle, the slug can grow a new one.|$|E

25|$|The naked {{human eye}} is weakly {{sensitive}} to polarization, {{without the need}} for intervening filters. Polarized light creates a very faint pattern {{near the center of the}} visual field, called Haidinger's brush. This pattern is very difficult to see, but with practice one can learn <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> polarized <b>light</b> with the naked eye.|$|R
40|$|In real life, light {{sources are}} {{frequently}} {{not present in}} our view field. However human vision is able to infer the illumination just by observing its effect on visible objects (serving as lightprobes) or, inverting the idea, {{it is able to}} spot an object which is incoherently lit in a composition. These lightprobes have been used by computer algorithms in the same manner <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>lights,</b> mimicking the human visual system (HVS). It has been proved that the presence of shadows or highlights in the lightprobe affects the accuracy of HVS, although its degree of influence remains unbeknownst until now. The present work performs a psychophysical analysis which aims to provide accurate data for light detection, perception-oriented rendering, image compositing and augmented reality...|$|R

50|$|Blepharisma are {{markedly}} photophobic, {{and when}} light levels are increased will seek out darkened areas. The ability <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>light</b> is accomplished with photosensitive pigment granules located {{just under the}} plasma membrane of the cell. The pigment in these granules is blepharismin, the same substance that gives Blepharisma their characteristic pinkish color. Blepharisma are usually pink when collected in nature, but when grown in darkness with abundant food they turn red. Exposure to light or starvation causes them to lose their color, but deeply-pigmented cells can even be killed by strong light.|$|E

50|$|While {{studying}} government (my major) in college, I {{found that}} certain silicon photodiodes can emit near-infrared radiation {{that can be}} detected by similar photodiodes. I managed to send modulated tones between such photodiodes. In 1971 I demonstrated the ability of many LEDs <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>light</b> while experimenting with an optical fiber communication system. By placing a single LED {{at each end of}} the fiber, it was possible to send signals both ways through the fiber with only a single, dual purpose semiconductor device {{at each end of the}} fiber.|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} {{aspect of}} quadrantanopia {{is that there}} exists a distinct and sharp border between the intact and damaged visual fields, due to an anatomical separation of the quadrants of the visual field. For example, information in the left half of visual field is processed in the right occipital lobe and information in the right half of the visual field is processed in the left occipital lobe. In a quadrantonopia that is partial, there also exists a distinct and sharp border between the intact and damaged field within the quadrant. The sufferer is able <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>light</b> within the damaged visual field.|$|E
50|$|There is a nerve ring {{round the}} pharynx (throat) and a {{ganglion}} {{that serves as}} a brain to one side of this. Nerves run from the ring and ganglion to the tentacles and {{to the rest of the}} body. Bryozoans have no specialized sense organs, but cilia on the tentacles act as sensors. Members of the genus Bugula grow towards the sun, and therefore must be able <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>light.</b> In colonies of some species, signals are transmitted between zooids through nerves that pass through pores in the body walls, and coordinate activities such as feeding and the retraction of lophophores.|$|E

Those materials are less sensitive to thermally generated carriers and, if associated with TPC, they would open new applications in the field of room-temperature infrared detection. However, such configuration implies the detection of low optical power delivered by CW light sources which signifies lower levels of generated TPC.|$|R

Chee-Chai Alien uses the infrared port of the Game Boy Color <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>light</b> as a fundamental part of the game. Pocket Music utilizes the Game Boy Colors sound chip in ways not possible on the Game Boy Advance, so a separate version was released for the Game Boy Advance.|$|E
50|$|In the {{conjugated}} chromophores, {{the electrons}} jump between energy levels that are extended pi orbitals, {{created by a}} series of alternating single and double bonds, often in aromatic systems. Common examples include retinal (used in the eye <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>light),</b> various food colorings, fabric dyes (azo compounds), pH indicators, lycopene, β-carotene, and anthocyanins. Various factors in a chromophore's structure go into determining at what wavelength region in a spectrum the chromophore will absorb. Lengthening or extending a conjugated system with more unsaturated (multiple) bonds in a molecule will tend to shift absorption to longer wavelengths. Woodward-Fieser rules can be used to approximate ultraviolet-visible maximum absorption wavelength in organic compounds with conjugated pi-bond systems.|$|E
5000|$|A blind spot, scotoma, is an {{obscuration}} of {{the visual}} field. A particular blind spot known as the physiological blind spot, [...] "blind point", or punctum caecum in medical literature, is the place in the visual field that corresponds {{to the lack of}} light-detecting photoreceptor cells on the optic disc of the retina where the optic nerve passes through the optic disc. Because there are no cells <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>light</b> on the optic disc, the corresponding part of the field of vision is invisible. Some process in our brains interpolates the blind spot based on surrounding detail and information from the other eye, so we do not normally perceive the blind spot.|$|E
50|$|This {{instrument}} {{also has}} a polarization detector. It is used <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> polarized <b>light</b> that is reflected back from the cornea. It {{is also used to}} analyze the change in the polarization of the reflected radiation. This element consists of a second synchronously rotating quarter-wave retarder and a linear polarizer in front of the photo-detector. The output is then sampled, digitized, and stored by a computer.|$|R
