25|$|A general festival for all {{the provinces}} of Sweden is customarily held at Uppsala every nine years. Participation in this festival is {{required}} of everyone. Kings and their subjects, collectively and individually, send their gifts to Uppsala; - and – a <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> cruel than any punishment – those who have already adopted Christianity buy themselves off from these ceremonies. The sacrifice is as follows; of every kind of male creature, nine victims are offered. By the blood of these creatures it is the custom to appease the gods. Their bodies, moreover, are hanged in a grove which is adjacent to the temple. This grove is so sacred {{to the people that}} the separate trees in it are believed to be holy because of the death or putrefaction of the sacrificial victims. There even dogs and horses hang beside human beings. (A certain Christian {{told me that he had}} seen seventy-two of their bodies hanging up together.) The incantations, however, which are usually sung in the performance of a libation of this kind are numerous and disgraceful, and it is better not to speak of them.|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov noted Lyadov's talent, as did Mussorgsky, who {{described}} Lyadov to Stasov in 1873 as [...] "a new, unmistakable, original and Russian young talent". Tchaikovsky, however, had been unimpressed. In 1882, the publisher Besel asked Tchaikovsky's opinion about an Arabesque for solo piano that Lyadov had written. Tchaikovsky replied, [...] "It {{is impossible to}} envisage any <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> vapid in content than this composer's music. He has many interesting chords and harmonic sequences, but not a single idea, even of the tiniest sort." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{aspect of}} the show that was widely {{discussed}} among commentators was the moral dilemma presented in the episode between a pragmatic approach to ruling or remaining true to the ideals of justice and honor, exemplified in the scene where Eddard summons Tywin Lannister to the court to answer for the crimes of his bannerman Gregor Clegane. Poniewozik states that Eddard [...] "doesn't seem to consider that he has options: he is left to rule in the king's place, an injustice has been committed, the law requires one path to justice and he chooses it. This makes his decision easy, but it may make his life, and others', difficult." [...] According to The Atlantics Scott Meslow, [...] "Ned's principles are, as always, admirable, and he's clearly interested in justice. But the sad {{truth is that the}} lack of guile that makes him honorable also makes him a pretty poor king. It's a terrible idea to order the arrest of the man who is single-handedly financing your kingdom." [...] Myles McNutt, writing for Cultural Learnings, agreed with Meslow and concluded that [...] "the only <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> dangerous than a reckless man asserting their [...] power in Westeros is an honorable man doing the same, as it threatens the delicate framework which has propped up King Robert for so long." ...|$|E

500|$|Long an {{advocate}} for gender equality in climbing, Hill has argued {{that men and women}} can climb the same routes: [...] "I think they should have women compete on the same climbs as the men, and if the women can't do the climbs, then they shouldn't be competing". For example, she argued that both sexes compete on the same routes in World Cup competitions. However, Hill later revised her view, noting that while she could and did compete with men [...] "spectators want to see people get to the top. And since most women aren't climbing at the same level as the top men, it's necessary to design a route that's a little easier for women". In answer to a question about whether or not women [...] "will ever equal or surpass men in climbing", Hill gave a detailed response, focused on body composition, size, and psychology, explaining that climbing [...] "favors people with high strength-to-weight ratios", less body fat, and greater height, articulating that such characteristics often favor men but that women [...] "have the advantage of being relatively light, with the capacity for tremendous endurance". She explained that [...] "theoretically somebody as short as me could be {{the best in the world}} because it doesn't depend so much on height now... And it's a psychological <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> than a physical thing." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the first three}} episodes, The New York Times saw in [...] "prim, righteous Brother Justin [...] more of a caricature, but Clancy Brown finds ways to bring some subtle glints of personality to the role." [...] Time commented, [...] "Brother Justin {{comes across as a}} typical whited sepulcher [...] if there's one <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> trite than a dwarf in a surreal drama, it's a preacher with a dark side [...] and Brown's campy performance largely involves shouting 'Enough!' and 'No-o-o-o!' with horror-flick pathos." [...] Entertainment Weekly considered Brown's Brother Justin [...] "delightfully unsettling as the creepy evangelist taking his orders from the wrong superpower", and Variety thought Brown was doing [...] "a superb job straddling the line between stoic and menacing, and there are hints about his weaknesses, conveyed quickly with subtlety." [...] A season 1 DVD review by DVD Talk saw Clancy Brown's performance as [...] "nothing short of brilliant. [...] Brown also has a difficult task capturing the duality of Brother Justin, a man who presents a physically intimidating presence but who wants little more than to be a subdued and loyal servant of his Lord, and he succeeds on every level." [...] DVDverdict stated in a season 2 review that [...] "Brown's presence and charisma is dazzling; he is both likable and frightening. He is an actor {{with a great deal of}} range, and he uses all of it in this series." [...] Referring to Brown's portrayal as [...] "a man of God in Carnivale", the Los Angeles Times saw Brown's [...] "eyes always betray him as someone who, all things considered, would probably be happier caving in your skull and smoking a cigarette afterward than talking to you for another minute." [...] Time Magazine's James Poniewozik depicted the Boardwalk Empire character Nelson Van Alden (played by Michael Shannon) as [...] "such a histrionic, guilt-wracked, damnation-obsessed monster that he reminds me of Brother Justin".|$|E

Shortly after joining UKIP, Carswell wrote on his blog: [...] "On {{the subject of}} immigration, let me make it absolutely clear: I'm not against immigration. The one <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> ugly than nativism is angry nativism." [...] He has also said: [...] "We should welcome those that {{want to come here}} to contribute ...

[...] "I am guilty, and I want to do the right <b>thing</b> ... <b>More</b> than anything, I want to apologize to the victim's family.

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Jackson {{and his new}} teammates was strained due to an interview with SPORT magazine writer Robert Ward. During spring training at the Yankees' camp in Fort Lauderdale, Jackson and Ward were having drinks at a nearby bar. Jackson's {{version of the story}} is that he noted that the Yankees had won the pennant the year before, but lost the World Series to the Reds, and suggested that they needed one <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> to win it all, and pointed out the various ingredients in his drink. Ward suggested that Jackson might be [...] "the straw that stirs the drink." [...] But when the story appeared in the June 1977 issue of SPORT, Ward quoted Jackson as saying, [...] "This team, it all flows from me. I'm the straw that stirs the drink. Maybe I should say me and Munson, but he can only stir it bad." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like Walter Scott and Landor, Southey {{connects the}} events {{surrounding}} Napoleon with the Moors' invasion of Spain within his work. In a letter to Landor, Southey described the rape scene: [...] "here you have {{a part of the}} poem so difficult to get over even tolerably that I verily believe if I had at first thought of making Roderick any <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> than a sincere penitent this difficulty would have deterred me from attempting the subject." [...] To overcome the problem with having his main character rape a woman, Southey decided to put some of the responsibility on Florinda and make Roderick more sympathetic. It is also possible that there are autobiographical elements to the scene, especially with Roderick's problematic marriage to a woman he did not love as possibly describing the events of his friend Samuel Taylor Coleridge's life and his love for Sara Hutchinson. This would allow Southey to deal with events from his life in a poetic form.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{friendship}} ended late in {{the summer}} of 1897 when Pinchot released a statement to a Seattle newspaper supporting sheep grazing in forest reserves. Muir confronted Pinchot and demanded an explanation. When Pinchot reiterated his position, Muir told him: [...] "I don't want any <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> to do with you." [...] This philosophical divide soon expanded and split the conservation movement into two camps: the preservationists, led by Muir; and Pinchot's camp, who co-opted the term [...] "conservation." [...] The two men debated their positions in popular magazines, such as Outlook, Harper's Weekly, Atlantic Monthly, World's Work, and Century. [...] Their contrasting views were highlighted again when the United States was deciding whether to dam Hetch Hetchy Valley. [...] Pinchot favored damming the valley as [...] "the highest possible use which could be made of it." [...] In contrast, Muir proclaimed, [...] "Dam Hetch Hetchy! As well dam for water-tanks the people's cathedrals and churches, for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the hearts of man." ...|$|E

2500|$|Winding up {{this account}} of George Canning as sophist {{in the service}} of devious {{political}} ends, Hazlitt maintains that his career is a significant example of the [...] "Genius of the Age". The age is one of words without substance, the substitution of words for things being an unfortunate sign of the spirit of the times. [...] "In fine," [...] observes Hazlitt, [...] "Mr. Canning's success as an orator, and the space he occupies in the public mind, are strong indications of the Genius of the Age, in which words have obtained a mastery over things 'and to call evil good and good evil,' is thought the mark of a superior and happy spirit." [...] It is not by chance that Canning, with his deftness with words, was also known as a satiric poet. But his satire, Hazlitt maintains, is of a shallow kind founded in dismissal of human feeling, in superficial contempt for the true poetry of life. [...] "Any <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> light or worthless cannot well be imagined." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the praise}} was {{directed}} especially for her many video game roles, including {{in a series}} of 2D fighting games by Capcom wherein she was noted as a particularly well animated character. In 1996, MAXIMUM reported Psylocke being possibly the most popular X-Men character in Japan, where Capcom games have introduced the franchise to general public, [...] "due to her Japanese appearance...and ninja-esque martial arts moves". Psylocke was chosen as one of the 20 [...] "muses" [...] of video games by Brazilian magazine SuperGamePower in 2001. In the 2009 Marvel poll asking who is the better fighter in Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Psylocke got over two-thirds of the votes (68%) against the Street Fighter series icon and the fighting game genre female symbol Chun-Li. UGO ranked her as fifth on their 2011 list of fighting games' finest female fighters for her appearances in Capcom titles, stating that [...] "the only <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> confusing than Psylocke's backstory is what exactly her powers are [...] all you really need to know is this: Psylocke is a sexy Asian lady ninja sporting the most obscene butt-floss this side of Linda Kozlowski in Crocodile Dundee".
