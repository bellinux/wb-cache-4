500|$|According to Smith, the album's lyrics had a {{negative}} impact on the band's later career. In 1984, Motown Records expressed interest in signing the band to a new UK division, with a provisional offer of a £46,000 up-front advance. A label executive asked <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>something</b> from the Fall's back catalogue, but Hex was the only album Smith had available; he remembered thinking, [...] "when he hears that, we've had it." [...] The rejection letter stated that the label saw [...] "no commercial potential in this band whatsoever". Smith believes this was due to the [...] "obligatory niggers" [...] line from the opening track [...] "The Classical".|$|E
500|$|In early 2007, Rihanna {{began work}} on her third studio album. In an {{interview}} with MTV News, she announced that [...] "the new music is going in a different direction. Not on purpose, but I just want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>something</b> fresh and mostly uptempo. I think that's where I {{want to go on}} this one. You feel different every album, and [...] this stage I feel like I want {{to do a lot of}} uptempo [...]" [...] The same year, Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by actress Charlize Theron's bob cut in the 2005 science fiction thriller Æon Flux.|$|E
5000|$|Billboard has stated: [...] "With its club synthesizers and Ne-Yo-aided chorus, {{the track}} {{is far more}} radio-friendly than his past attempts. But it's also the least distinctive. A song like [...] "Baby by Me" [...] that overtly reaches for a pop {{audience}} may put 50 Cent back on the airwaves, but it won't necessarily energize the rapper's core fans. At this point, they might be more receptive <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>something</b> outside the box." ...|$|R

500|$|R.E.M. {{recorded}} the Chronic Town EP with Mitch Easter in October 1981, {{and planned to}} release it on a new indie label named Dasht Hopes. However, I.R.S. Records acquired a demo of the band's first recording session with Easter that had been circulating for months. The band turned down the advances of major label RCA Records in favor of I.R.S., with whom it signed a contract in May 1982. I.R.S. released Chronic Town that August as its first American release. A positive review of the EP by NME praised the songs' auras of mystery, and concluded, [...] "R.E.M. ring true, and it's great <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>something</b> as unforced and cunning as this." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} redone by the Will & Grace cast as [...] "He's Hot" [...] for the sitcom's soundtrack in 2004 and even {{includes}} vocal samples from Madonna herself. Almost {{all of the}} instrumental part of the song [...] "He's Hot!" [...] uses samples from the original song. The Canadian teen drama , which is known for naming each episode after an 80s hit song, named a two-part episode after [...] "Holiday". In 2006, critics noted strong similarity between [...] "Holiday" [...] and American singer Jessica Simpson's single [...] "A Public Affair". When criticized for its unoriginality, Simpson told MTV: [...] "I think people are ready <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>something</b> that Madonna used to do. We all need to hear that every now and again. It wasn't a sample or something I meant to do, but she did influence me and still does today." [...] In 2008, [...] "Holiday" [...] appeared on the video game [...] Kelis often performs a mash-up of her own hit [...] "Milkshake" [...] with [...] "Holiday" [...] live. In 2003, a snippet of the song appeared in the film Rugrats Go Wild, when the families went on their cruise.|$|E

Imagine living your life knowing {{that at any}} point you might be CRUSHED BY THE WEIGHT OF YOUR OWN AMAZINGNESS", noting that the band Dragonette was a large part behind {{the success of the}} track. Dan Lambden from the online magazine So So Gay found the song to be a [...] "perfect medium between classic pop lyrics" [...] and [...] "a pulsating dance beat", and positively commented on the riffs within the track stating they would [...] "satisfy the most Hoxton of hipsters". Emily Mackay from NME declared [...] "I'd be a bit freaked out by a phonecall like that" [...] in response to the lyrics [...] "I’d like a phone call/I’d like <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>something</b> like this—WAHWAHWAHWAH". Mackay called the track [...] "classy" [...] and concluded her review saying [...] "the sugar-spun electropop goes down smooth." [...] Despite listing [...] "Lucky Day" [...] as one of the singles of the week, Alex Macpherson of Metro gave a predominantly negative review noting [...] "She’s lionised by a cult fan base, but wider appeal remains elusive" [...] and further explaining that [...] "her voice is simultaneously too weak and shrill to carry".|$|E

500|$|... "Since U Been Gone" [...] {{has also}} been covered by contestants from reality {{television}} singing competitions. The song was performed by Todrick Hall on the eighth season of American Idol. Despite fulfilling the judges' desire <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>something</b> original, his rendition of the song drew criticism from the judges, with Simon Cowell commenting that Hall seemed like a dancer trying to sing. On November 26, 2011, Amelia Lily performed the song on the eighth series of The X Factor UK. Her rendition was praised by the judges; Louis Walsh felt that her performance was effortless while Kelly Rowland remarked that [...] "Amelia Lily hits those notes in her sleep!" [...] The song was also covered by Luke O'Dell on the third season of The X Factor Australia. On June 13, 2012, John Legend and his duet partner, Meleana Brown, covered [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] in Duets. Katy Kroll of Rolling Stone lambasted their cover for being [...] "pitchy" [...] and [...] "almost unlistenable", Gord Craig of Leader-Post felt that Brown did not deliver her best although she sounded great with Legend. In the third season of The Sing Off, the winning group Pentatonix sang a [...] "mastermix" [...] of [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] and [...] "Forget You". All three judges were impressed with Ben Folds commenting [...] "You guys gave voices to the instruments" [...] while Shawn Stockman, praising the rhythm and percussion section, renamed Kevin and Avi [...] "Meat and Potatoes".|$|E
500|$|On {{her first}} {{televised}} performance of [...] "White Horse", on November 23, 2008, at the 2008 American Music Awards, Swift donned a white evening gown {{as she sat}} on floral-patterned couch. While promoting the song, she later performed it at the Nomination Concert for the 51st Grammy Awards, where she coupled it in a medley with a cover of Brenda Lee's [...] "I'm Sorry", and the AOL Sessions. Since, Swift has performed the track at the Studio 330 Sessions, the 2009 CMA Music Festival, the 2009 V Festival, and on Dancing with the Stars. Swift performed [...] "White Horse" [...] on all venues in 2009 and 2010 of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour. During the performances, Swift wore a pastel sundress as performed solely playing an acoustic guitar, {{standing at the edge}} of the stage's runway. In the concert on May 22, 2009, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, Swift sang [...] "White Horse" [...] in duet with American singer John Mayer. Reviewing the June 2, 2010 concert at Verizon Center in Washington, D.C., Dave McKenna of The Washington Post reported, [...] "On 'White Horse,' the chorus of believers also joined in, and threw their young fists in the air to yell Swift's esteem-free but cathartic climax, 'I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well!'" [...] Swift said in a 2012 interview with Cosmopolitan that White Horse is in fact her favorite song to sing live, [...] "a song that I've always been proud of because it's about that really horrible feeling of a one-sided relationship that isn't balanced; it's one-sided. You clearly love him more than he loves you, and you know it. And it's a sinking feeling, but it's also a really intoxicating feeling. And a lot of times girls will end up in these relationships where he's not giving you anything so you'll take the crumbs. In my mind what hurts the most is what they didn't say. It's when they knew I needed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>something</b> and they wouldn't just say it. They knew I needed commitment or loyalty or reassurance, and they wouldn't give it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The inaugural public {{performance}} of the song took place at Belfast's Ulster Hall on 5 March 1971. Bassist John Paul Jones recalls that the crowd was unimpressed: [...] "They were all bored to tears waiting <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>something</b> they knew." [...] However, Page stated about an early performance at the LA Forum, before the record had even come out, that: ...|$|E

2500|$|During October and November 2009, they {{recorded}} the album Absolute Dissent (2010), marking the band's 30th anniversary. It {{was preceded by}} the In Excelsis EP in June 2010. In November, the band received the [...] "Innovator Award" [...] at the 2010 Classic Rock Roll of Honour; the award was presented to Killing Joke by Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, who stated, [...] "I go back a long way with Jaz Coleman and the band. I used {{to go and see}} the band, and it was a band that really impressed me because Geordie's guitar sound was just really, really strong. And they were really tribal, the band, and it was really intense. It was just really good <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>something</b> like that during the 80s, which sort of caved in a bit with haircuts and synthesizers". The band were also honoured by [...] Metal Hammer at their annual awards, receiving the Album of the Year award for Absolute Dissent.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the success}} of The Ostrobothnians, Madetoja {{departed}} for France, staying for six months in Houilles, a small town just outside of Paris. Here, in the quiet of the Parisian suburbs, Madetoja began to compose his Third Symphony, Op. 55, and upon returning to Finland in October (due to financial worries), {{his work on the}} project continued. The new symphony received its premiere in Helsinki on 8 April 1926, and although Madetoja received the usual praise, the audience and critics found the new work somewhat perplexing: with the monumental, elegiac Second Symphony having set expectations, the optimism and restraint of the Third came as a surprise, its (subsequent) significance eluding nearly everyone. Some years later, the French music writer, Henri-Claude Fantapié, described the cheerful, pastorale Third Symphony as a [...] "sinfonia Gallica" [...] in spirit and explained the premiere as thus: [...] "The listeners expected the opera [...] to be followed by a nationalistic anthem and were disappointed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>something</b> that seemed to them to be hermetic and that, to crown it all, was lacking in pomposity and solemnity … the properties the majority of Finnish music-lovers always expect in a new work." [...] Nevertheless, today the Third Symphony is widely regarded as Madetoja's [...] "masterpiece", the rare Finnish symphony equal in stature to Sibelius's seven essays in the form.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the cars}} take the green flag to start each race, Waltrip shouts [...] "Boogity, boogity, boogity, let's go racing boys and girls!" [...] This {{somewhat}} nonsensical phrase has become Waltrip's trademark in recent years. (The phrase [...] "boogity, boogity, boogity" [...] also {{appears in the}} 1960 doo wop parody [...] "Who Put the Bomp" [...] by Barry Mann.) Humble Pie used the shorter phrase [...] "boogity-boogity" [...] in their 1970 song [...] "Red Light Mama, Red Hot". Ray Stevens used the phrase throughout his 1974 hit, The Streak. Jerry Reed also said this phrase in the 1977 movie [...] "Smokey and the Bandit." [...] Interestingly, Waltrip was featured on a 1992 home video from Ray Stevens entitled the Amazing Rolling Revue. In this home video Waltrip played {{the part of the}} out of control driver of the tour bus/rolling venue. Waltrip explained that the catchphrase arose because, as a driver, he grew tired of hearing his spotter or crew chief say [...] "green, green, green" [...] at the start of every race and wanted <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>something</b> more original. The catchphrase had always been preceded by fellow analyst and former crew chief Larry McReynolds telling Waltrip to [...] "reach up there and pull those belts tight one more time!" [...] until recent years, when McReynolds used the phrase less and less and eventually phased it out altogether.|$|E
2500|$|As with {{previous}} sessions, Mike Sapone acted {{as both a}} band member and co-producer, while the band were also involved in the albums production. Discussing Sapone's involvement, Lacey defined Sapone as having [...] "as much at stake with the music as we do; he's as invested in it as we are, sometimes more." [...] Accardi described Sapone as having [...] "an uncanny ability <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>something</b> you’re doing and immediately track it to any song in his library that he stores in his brain. He'll go to it, {{show it to you}} and tell you that that’s what needs to happen. Here's the better version of it. This is what you’re trying to do and you don't even realize it." [...] Most of the songs were brought to the studio in acoustic form, sometimes as a complete song and sometimes as just a part or riff. The band would then build upon these ideas, recording everything as they worked. The band members were not limited by their normal roles within Brand New, with much instrument swapping and experimenting taking place in writing individual parts. Lacey later commented that [...] "it was such a collaborative effort with the band. Vin might write a drum part or Brian might write a guitar part or whatever. We're not really keeping tabs of how much everyone has at stake on each song".|$|E
