5|$|The ABJM theory {{appearing}} in {{this version of}} the correspondence is also interesting for a variety of reasons. Introduced by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis, and Maldacena, it is closely related to another quantum field theory called Chern–Simons theory. The latter theory was popularized by Witten in the late 1980s because of its applications <b>to</b> <b>knot</b> theory. In addition, the ABJM theory serves as a semi-realistic simplified model for solving problems that arise in condensed matter physics.|$|E

Lickorish is a rigorous introduction for graduate students, covering a nice mix of classical and modern topics.|$|E

Despite falling behind in the first 5 minutes {{for the second time}} in 4 nights, United was able <b>to</b> <b>knot</b> the score on a header by Pontius just before halftime, on another great cross into the box by Kemp. The winning goal came on a penalty kick taken by Rolfe in the 85th minute, leaving United where it began the month, on top of the Eastern Conference.|$|E
25|$|Notre Dame gets another win and Brady Quinn makes {{another case}} for the Heisman Trophy going 23 of 35 for 346 yards and 4 TDs. The game started with Brady Quinn hitting Rhema McKnight for a 7-yd TD pass and giving Notre Dame a 7-0 lead. But UNC came back with Joe Dailey {{throwing}} a 12-yd TD pass to Jesse Holley <b>to</b> <b>knot</b> up the score 7-7. But Notre Dame came back with Quinn throwing an 11-yd strike to John Carlson to close out the 1st quarter 14-7. The 2nd quarter started like the 1st with Quinn hitting McKnight for a 14-yd TD pass putting the Irish up 21-7 and Carl Gioia hit a 27-yd kick to make it 24-7 but UNC's Brandon Tate would return the kickoff 90-yds for a TD, the only saving grace being that the XP was blocked making the score 24-13. The half closed out with Tom Zbikowski returning a punt 52 yds for a TD and increasing the lead to 31-13 going into the half.|$|E
25|$|On the pitch, things {{continued}} fairly brightly for the team, which {{finished the}} month atop both the Eastern Conference and overall MLS standings based on most points per game. Despite squandering second-half leads {{at home against}} both the New York Red Bulls and the Houston Dynamo, United did not lose in April. Against New York, DC, took a 2–0 lead {{on a pair of}} goals by Perry Kitchen. The Red Bulls came back to get a point, culminating the comeback as Lloyd Sam knocked in a rebound when Hamid could not control a Sacha Kljestan free kick. In the next match, against the Dynamo, United's Chris Rolfe scored on a free kick from almost the same spot that the Red Bulls took their game-tying free-kick in the previous match. Once again, though, the defense failed to prevent a late goal on a tap-in following a rebound allowed by the DC goalie, This time it was Andrew Dykstra who was in the net, unable to prevent the tying goal. After the successive disappointing home draws, DC United finished the month with a surprising win in Vancouver, a first ever for the franchise. The Whitecaps opened the scoring in that match with a goal on their first foray forward, but DC responded with a goal by Bobby Boswell <b>to</b> <b>knot</b> the score. Just before halftime, Fabian Espindola, drew a foul along with a second yellow card for Whitecaps player, Matias Laba. Espindola was making his MLS season debut after serving a 6-game suspension. Playing with a man-advantage, United took the lead in the second half on a goal by Chris Rolfe. Defending the lead was made more challenging when goalie Andrew Dykstra injured his ankle and had to be subbed off. Dykstra was playing because Bill Hamid was back in Washington, missing his second straight match, nursing a thigh injury. Rookie Travis Worra came on to make his MLS debut, manning the goal as United held on for a 2–1 win.|$|E

In the 83rd minute, Giovinco again beat United's second-string goalkeeper, Dykstra, this time from distance, to earn all 3 points for the visiting team. The home defeat was the first for United since dropping a game to the Sounders nearly a year earlier in June 2014. United's home unbeaten streak ended at 20 games, but the team still held on to first place in the Eastern Conference. A week later, the team traveled to Orlando where they fell by a 1–0 scoreline, marking the first time in 2015 that D.C. United lost two consecutive games.
