Despite various {{research}} efforts on microRNAs, how microRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> are transcriptionally regulated {{and how the}} transcriptional regulation of microRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> relates {{to that of the}} microRNA genes are not well studied. By investigating the transcriptional regulation of microRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes,</b> we found that different groups of <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> of the same microRNA are co-expressed under different conditions, and these groups rarely overlap with each other for the majority of microRNAs. We also discovered that co-expressed microRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> are often co-regulated, and different groups of <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> of the same microRNA are often regulated differently. In addition, we observed that transcription factors regulating a microRNA gene often regulate its <b>target</b> <b>genes.</b> Our study sheds light on the regulation of microRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes,</b> which will facilitate the prediction of microRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> and the understanding of the transcriptional regulation of microRNA genes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn metazoans, the Wnt {{signaling}} pathway {{plays a key}} role in the regulation of binary decisions during development. During this process different sets of <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> are activated in cells where the Wnt pathway is active (classic <b>target</b> <b>genes)</b> versus cells where the pathway is inactive (opposite <b>target</b> <b>genes).</b> While the mechanism of transcriptional activation is well understood for classic <b>target</b> <b>genes,</b> how opposite <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> are activated in the absence of Wnt remains poorly characterized. Here we discuss how the key transcriptional mediator of the Wnt pathway, the TCF family member POP- 1, regulates opposite <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> during C. elegans development.

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are thought}} to exert their {{functions}} by modulating the expression of hundreds of <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> and each to a small degree, but it remains unclear how small changes in hundreds of <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> are translated into the specific function of a miRNA.

25|$|Reisch and Prather pioneered a {{technique}} that combines both the λ-red and CRISPR/Cas9 recombination systems to form a novel methodology called no-SCAR (Scarless Cas9 Assisted Recombineering) for E. coli genome modifications. In this method, a plasmid containing the gene for Cas9 expression (cas9) is first transformed into E. coli cells. After selecting for the transformants using antibiotic resistance, another plasmid containing the <b>targeted</b> <b>gene</b> {{of interest in the}} form of sgRNA and the λ-red operon is transfected. After induced expression of the λ-red recombineering system, linear DNA to be incorporated into the E. coli genome is transformed into the cells. The expression of Cas9 and the sgRNA are then induced, which results in the Cas9 locating the E. coli target DNA based on the sgRNA complement. Cas9 is able to initiate a double strand break and the λ-red system is able to bring the linear DNA to E. coli genome for homologous recombination. The cells are then cured of the plasmid containing the specific sgRNA and then the next plasmid containing the specific sgRNA target sequence can be transformed and the process is repeated.|$|E

While {{it was known}} that plants expressing virus-specific proteins showed enhanced tolerance or resistance to viral infection, it was not expected that plants carrying only short, non-coding regions of viral RNA sequences would show similar levels of protection. Researchers believed that viral RNA produced by transgenes could also inhibit viral replication. The reverse experiment, in which short sequences of plant genes were introduced into viruses, showed that the <b>targeted</b> <b>gene</b> was suppressed in an infected plant.

40|$|AbstractThe Notch {{signaling}} pathway regulates metazoan development, in part, by directly controlling the transcription of <b>target</b> <b>genes.</b> For a given cellular context, however, only subsets {{of the known}} <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> are transcribed when the pathway is activated. Thus, there are context-dependent mechanisms that selectively maintain repression of <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> transcription when the Notch pathway is activated. This review focuses on molecular mechanisms that have been recently reported to mediate selective repression of Notch pathway <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> transcription.

However, inference of <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> regulation by miRNAs is difficult and is often achieved simply by investigating significant upregulation during cell senescence. Here, we inferred the regulation of <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> by miRNAs, using the recently developed MiRaGE server, together with the change in miRNA expression during fibroblast IMR 90 cell senescence. We revealed that the simultaneous consideration of 2 criteria, the up(down) regulation and the down(up) regulatiion of <b>target</b> <b>genes,</b> yields more feasible miRNA, i. e., those that are most frequently reported to be down/upregulated and/or to possess biological backgrounds that induce cell senescence.

2500|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{combinations}} that can give rise to a successful chimera mouse and — according to the goal of the experiment — an appropriate cell and embryo combination can be picked; they are generally but not limited to diploid embryo and ES cells, diploid embryo and diploid embryo, ES cell and tetraploid embryo, diploid embryo and tetraploid embryo, ES cells and ES cells. The combination of embryonic stem cell and diploid embryo is a common technique used for the making of chimeric mice, since gene targeting can be done in the embryonic stem cell. These kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the diploid embryo or injection of the stem cells into the diploid embryo. If embryonic stem cells are to be used for gene targeting to make a chimera, the following procedure is common: a construct for homologous recombination for the gene targeted will be introduced into cultured mouse embryonic stem cells from the donor mouse, by way of electroporation; cells positive for the recombination event will have antibiotic resistance, provided by the insertion cassette used in the gene targeting; and be able to be positively selected for. [...] ES cells with the correct <b>targeted</b> <b>gene</b> are then injected into a diploid host mouse blastocyst. These injected blastocysts are then implanted into a pseudo pregnant female surrogate mouse which will bring the embryos to term and give birth to a mouse whose germline is derived from the donor mouse's ES cells. This same procedure can be achieved through aggregation of ES cells and diploid embryos, diploid embryos are cultured in aggregation plates in wells where single embryos can fit, to these wells ES cells are added the aggregates are cultured until a single embryo is formed and has progressed to the blastocyst stage, and can then be transferred to the surrogate mouse.|$|E

In addition, we constructed a set of mutant genotypes that measures the regulatory contribution of individual homeotic genes to a complex <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> expression pattern. Using these mutants, we demonstrate that homeotic <b>genes</b> can regulate <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> expression at the start of gastrulation, suggesting a previously unknown role for the homeotic genes at this early stage. We also show that, in abdominal segments, the levels of expression for two <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> increase in response to high levels of Ubx, demonstrating that the normal down-regulation of Ubx in these segments is functional. Finally, the DNA sequence of cDNAs for one of these genes predicts a protein that is similar to a human proto-oncogene involved in acute myeloid leukemias. These results illustrate potentially general rules about the homeotic control of <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> expression and suggest that subtractive hybridization can be used to isolate interesting homeotic <b>target</b> <b>genes...</b>|$|R

Here we directly tested whether different concentration thresholds within the Bcd gradient establish the relative positions of its <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> by flattening the gradient and systematically varying expression levels. Genome-wide expression profiles were used to estimate the total number of Bcd <b>target</b> <b>genes,</b> and a general correlation was found between the Bcd concentration required for activation and the positions where <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> are expressed in wild-type embryos. However, concentrations required for <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> activation in embryos with flattened Bcd were consistently lower than those present at each <b>target</b> <b>gene's</b> position in the wild-type gradient, suggesting that Bcd is in excess at every position along the AP axis. Also, several Bcd <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> were positioned in correctly ordered stripes in embryos with flattened Bcd, and we suggest that these stripes are normally regulated by interactions between Bcd and the terminal patterning system. Our findings argue strongly against the strict interpretation of the Bcd morphogen hypothesis, and support the idea that <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> positioning involves combinatorial interactions that are mediated by the binding site architecture of each gene's cis-regulatory elements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background MicroRNA-mediated {{control of}} gene {{expression}} via translational inhibition has substantial impact on cellular regulatory mechanisms. About 37 % of mammalian microRNAs {{appear to be}} located within introns of protein coding genes, linking their expression to the promoter-driven regulation of the host gene. In our study we investigate this linkage towards a relationship beyond transcriptional co-regulation. Results Using measures based on both annotation and experimental data, we show that intronic microRNAs tend to support their host genes by regulation of <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> expression with significantly correlated expression patterns. We used expression data of three differentiating cell types and compared gene expression profiles of host and <b>target</b> <b>genes.</b> Many microRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> show expression patterns significantly correlated with the expressions of the microRNA host genes. By calculating functional similarities between host and predicted microRNA <b>target</b> <b>genes</b> based on GO annotations, we confirm that many microRNAs link host and <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> activity in an either synergistic or antagonistic manner. Conclusions These two regulatory effects may result from fine tuning of <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> expression functionally related to the host or knock-down of remaining opponent <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> expression. This finding allows to extend the common practice of mapping large scale gene expression data to protein associated genes with functionality of co-expressed intronic microRNAs. </p...|$|R
