5|$|In mid-1806, Cabell learned <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> sick. Not long after, however, he {{received}} word <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> improving {{and expected to}} meet him in Virginia {{en route to the}} capital. Although a rendezvous location had not been set, he assumed it would be in Lynchburg, where the Breckinridges had relatives. In October, he traveled to his uncle Lewis Breckinridge's home to wait for his father, but he never came. Disappointed, he returned to Princeton for the beginning of the new term, unaware that his father's recovery had been short-lived. Later he learned that his father had attempted to leave Cabell's Dale on October 22 but collapsed off his horse and returned to his sick bed; he died December 14, 1806.|$|E

5|$|Amin did {{not write}} an autobiography, {{and he did not}} authorize an {{official}} written account of his life. So, there are discrepancies regarding when and where he was born. Most biographical sources claim that he was born in either Koboko or Kampala around 1925. Other unconfirmed sources state Amin's year of birth from as early as 1923 to as late as 1928. Amin's son Hussein has stated <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> born in Kampala in 1928.|$|E

He later stated <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> a Muslim mullah named Hafiz Yazan Bazna, his uncle was Major General Kemal, and his grandfather was Tahir Pasha the Brave. Both his grandfather and uncle were Young Turks that served under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.|$|E

5|$|Beresford visited several {{schools and}} auditioned many {{children}} {{for the role of}} Sonny before he came across Allan Hubbard in Paris, Texas. Beresford said Hubbard, like Harper, was chosen based on a simple, rural quality he possessed. The boy was able to relate easily to the character because, like Sonny, his father died at an early age; later, some media reports falsely claimed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> killed during the Vietnam War, just as Sonny's was in the film's backstory. None of the filmmakers knew Hubbard's father had died until after filming began. Duvall developed a strong, trusting relationship with Hubbard, which Foote felt improved the duo's on-screen chemistry. Hubbard would often play guitar with Duvall during breaks from filming.|$|E

He had to take them to {{pastures}} in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began to suspect that his life was going to change forever and <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> {{not going to be able}} to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E
5|$|Charles Domery (later {{also known}} as Charles Domerz) was born in Benche, Poland, in around 1778. From the age of 13, Domery had an unusually large appetite. He was one of nine brothers, all of whom Domery said {{suffered}} from the same condition. Domery recalled <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> a hearty eater and generally ate his meat half-boiled, but {{was too young to}} recall the quantity. The only illness Domery was aware of in the family was an outbreak of smallpox in his youth, which was survived by all the family.|$|E
5|$|He {{also started}} a {{successful}} private company {{in partnership with}} the older and more experienced Michael Grubb, one of the directors of the SOIC and founder of the first Swedish trading office in Canton. They traded in Canton and Macao, which technically was against the rules and regulations in the charter of the SOIC. Grill took advantage of the fact <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> a director of the SOIC, and until his father's death shipped his own goods on board SOIC ships. From Europe the ships brought objets d'art, corals from the Mediterranean Sea, expensive clocks and other mechanical automatons known to the Chinese as sing-songs. Such goods were appreciated by the Emperor and the rich mandarins.|$|E

Christian attempts to cover this up by making Jack sign a form detailing the surgery, albeit with his inebriation omitted from the report, stating that the hospital will revoke his medical license if alcohol is mentioned.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the Baths of Caracalla {{began in}} 211 {{at the start}} of Caracalla's rule. The baths are named for Caracalla, though it is most {{probable}} <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> responsible for their planning. In 216 a partial inauguration of the baths took place, but the outer perimeter of the baths was not completed until the reign of Severus Alexander. These large baths were typical of the Roman practice of building complexes for social and state activities in large densely populated cities. The baths covered around 50 acres (or 202,000 square meters) of land and could accommodate around 1,600 bathers at any one time. They were the second largest public baths built in ancient Rome and were complete with swimming pools, exercise yards, a stadium, steam rooms, libraries, meeting rooms, fountains, and other amenities, all of which were enclosed within formal gardens. The interior spaces were decorated with colourful marble floors, columns, mosaics, and colossal statuary.|$|E

5|$|Echmarcach {{was the son}} of a {{man named}} Ragnall. Whilst Echmarcach bore a Gaelic name, the name of his father is {{ultimately}} derived from Old Norse, a fact that serves to exemplify the hybrid nature of the eleventh-century Irish Sea region, The identity of Echmarcach's father is uncertain. One possibility is that Ragnall was a member of the dynasty that ruled the Norse-Gaelic enclave of Waterford in tenth- and eleventh centuries. If so, Echmarcach may have been the son of one of two Waterfordian rulers: Ragnall mac Ímair, King of Waterford (died 1018), or this man's apparent son, Ragnall ua Ímair, King of Waterford (died 1035). Another possibility is that Echmarcach belonged to a family from the Isles, and <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> Ragnall mac Gofraid, King of the Isles (died 1004/1005), son and possible successor of Gofraid mac Arailt, King of the Isles (died 989). As a descendant of either of the aforesaid families, Echmarcach would appear to have been a member of the Uí Ímair, a royal dynasty descended from the Scandinavian sea-king Ímar (died c.873).|$|E

Spender fails in his task, but Krycek comes to his aid and finishes. Krycek reveals to Spender <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> responsible for Cassandra's abductions and that his role is to protect his father's stake in the project, facts that upset Agent Spender.|$|E
