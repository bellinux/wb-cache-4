5|$|This river {{valve system}} {{was one of}} the first parts of the dam to be built when the dam project started in 1961, because its initial purpose was to divert the river while the dam was under construction. After that, it served various purposes, {{including}} as a possible emergency release valve. Since the accident, DWR had implemented a standing order that prohibited the operation of the river outlet system and significantly limited access to the river valve chamber. Following the accident, DWR entered into a 2012 Agreement with CalOSHA to hire a third party expert to improve the safety of the River Valve Outlet System (RVOS) and make it operational again. In 2014, DWR embarked on an accelerated refurbishment program to respond to concerns about operational needs during the ongoing drought. The system was mostly refurbished and was used during 2014 and 2015 to meet Endangered Species Act <b>temperature</b> <b>requirements</b> for the Feather River. Some additional refurbishments were being made to portions of the RVOS and were expected to conclude in early 2017.|$|E

2500|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} {{refrigerated storage}} {{area in the}} basement opened for use in July 1893. The basement storage area consists of 52 separate rooms ranging in volume from [...] {{for a total of}} [...] of storage space. The temperature of each room can be controlled individually to meet <b>temperature</b> <b>requirements</b> for different goods: [...] for meat and poultry, [...] for fruits and vegetables. The refrigeration system uses brine water and ammonia, and includes an array of specially designed pumps, compressors, and other equipment in its operation. The storage area was more expensive to maintain and had a larger staff than the market itself, though refrigerating the basement storage area was thought to be well worth the high cost. It allowed merchants to keep seasonal products in stock all year round for the first time. Third parties also leased the storage area for storing other goods. Restaurants and plant and produce sellers around the area leased out space in the basement. Hospitals used the basement area to store perishable medicine. Local Breweries, including Yuengling, used it to store their hops.|$|E

50|$|Natural {{circulation}} was {{a necessary}} ability considered for the reactor.

Another reason is the generation of Helium gas by reaction (n, α) as well as serving as a neutron absorber. This required the ability to remove and extract Helium.|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{the role of the}} C-terminal domain of the alpha subunit (alphaCTD) of Escherichia coli RNA {{polymerase}} during transcription initiation at promoters lacking an UP-element. The <b>temperature</b> <b>requirement</b> for open complex formation was used as an indication of the kinetics of this process. We have previously shown that alphaCTD is required for transcription initiation at low temperature at the galP 1 promoter, a promoter containing an UP-element. DNase I footprinting has been used to reveal the structure of open promoter complexes and the <b>temperature</b> <b>requirement</b> for open complex formation has been determined using potassium permanganate as a probe. In this work we show that, although alphaCTD is not absolutely required for transcription initiation at promoters lacking an UP-element, it does play a role during transcription initiation. This role is independent of the sequence of the promoter upstream from the - 35 region and does not require stable alphaCTD-DNA interactions as determined by DNase I footprinting. The role of alphaCTD at promoters lacking an UP-element is discussed...|$|R
