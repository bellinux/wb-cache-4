40|$|During the {{preparation}} of a Safety Analysis Report at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, we studied the release of chlorine from a compressed gas experimental apparatus. This paper presents the second part {{in a series of}} two papers on this topic. The first paper focuses on the frequency of an unmitigated release from the system; this paper discusses the consequences of the release. The release of chlorine from the experimental apparatus was modeled as an unmitigated blowdown through a 0. 25 inch (0. 0064 m) outside diameter tube. The physical properties of chlorine were considered as were the dynamics of the fluid flow problem. The calculated release rate was used as input for the consequence assessment. Downwind concentrations as a function of time were evaluated and then compared <b>to</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>guidelines.</b> For comparison purposes, a typical water treatment plant was briefly studied.

40|$|The {{power draw}} {{characteristics}} of air compressors are primarily {{determined by the}} type of compressor control and the relationship between the compressor's output capacity and the compressed air demand in the plant. In this paper, we review the most common types of compressor control for small reciprocating and rotary air compressors, and derive relations for estimating compressed air output {{as a function of the}} type of control and motor loading. Using these relations, we develop a method to estimate the ratio of compressed air output to energy input, which we call the average operating efficiency, based on input power to the compressor. The measured power draw signatures of industrial air compressors operating in different control modes and with different loads are discussed as case studies. The case studies illustrate how to identify the type of control, and potential problems such as inadequate compressed air storage, over-sized compressors, and compressed air leaks from the power signatures. Average operating efficiencies for the case studies are compared <b>to</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>guidelines</b> for energy-efficient air compression...|$|R

40|$|Micro-injection {{moulding}} (µ-IM) {{has attracted}} {{a lot of interest}} because of its potential for the production of low-cost, miniaturized parts in high-volume. Applications of this technology are, amongst others, microfluidic components for lab-on-a-chip devices and micro-optical components. In both cases, the control of the part flatness is a key aspect to maintaining the component's functionality. The objective of this work is to determine the factors affecting the flatness of a polymer part manufactured by µ-IM and to control the manufacturing process with the aim of minimizing the in-process part deformation. As a case study, a PMMA microfluidic substrate with overall dimensions of 10 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness was investigated by designing a µ-IM experiment having flatness as the experimental response. The part flatness was measured using a micro-coordinate measuring machine. Finite elements analysis was also carried out to study the optimal ejection pin configuration. The results of this work show that the control of the µ-IM process conditions can improve the flatness of the polymer part up to about 15 µm. Part flatness as low as 4 µm can be achieved by modifying the design of the ejection system according <b>to</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>guideline...</b>|$|R

40|$|Silicon {{photonic}} wire waveguides {{are usually}} highly birefringent, {{so they are}} generally designed to operate for one particular polarization. For commonly used waveguides with a silicon thickness of 220 nm, TE polarization is preferred since TM is only weakly guided. For waveguides with a silicon thickness larger than 250 nm, both TE and TM polarizations have been employed. Overall, the choice of polarization has largely appeared arbitrary. In this presentation we review the pertinent polarization-dependent waveguide properties, including losses, back-reflection, polarization conversion and fabrication tolerances, with the intent <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>guidelines</b> for choosing the proper polarization.
