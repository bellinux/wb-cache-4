5|$|Acting on {{recommendations}} from Beckham's commission, legislators helped offset the lost {{revenue from the}} sales tax by raising excise taxes; of particular import was the tax on whiskey, which {{was made possible by}} the repeal of Prohibition in 1935. Legislators also enacted the state's first income tax during the session. Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through <b>the</b> <b>Governmental</b> Reorganization Act of 1936. The bill realized significant cost savings by restructuring the state government, reducing the number of boards and commissions in the executive branch from 133 to 22. Critics pointed out that the act also centralized more {{power in the hands of}} the governor and accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting it.|$|E
5|$|As the LSA grew, {{it began}} {{to take on a}} larger role outside of the {{professional}} sphere. During World War II, the LSA helped the United States government with language training programs through its Linguistic Institutes. After the longtime Secretary-Treasurer Archibald Hill retired from his position in 1969, the LSA made large changes to its organizational structure to better accommodate its new and growing role. The responsibilities of the Secretary-Treasurer were expanded and the LSA established a Secretariat in Washington, DC in order to act as a liaison between the members, federal government, and other professional organizations. In 1981, the LSA and 9 other professional organizations founded the Consortium of Social Science Associations in order to advocate for <b>the</b> <b>governmental</b> support of social science research.|$|E

5|$|Takechi's Daydream {{had been}} {{considered}} a national embarrassment by the Japanese government because of its highly publicized release while the world {{was focused on the}} country for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.

Takechi's fourth film, the Nikkatsu-produced Black Snow (1965), was even more controversial than his previous work. David Desser credits Black Snow with bringing a political theme to the pink film. Politics would be featured in many later films in the pink genre, most notably those of Kōji Wakamatsu.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{distance}} between legislation and its enforcement. <b>The</b> <b>governmental</b> attacks on recusancy were mostly upon the gentry. Few recusants were actually fined; the fines that were imposed were often at reduced rates; the persecution eased; priests came to recognise {{that they should}} not refuse communion to occasional conformists. The persecutions did not extinguish the faith, but they tested it sorely. The huge number of Roman Catholics in East Anglia and the North in the 1560s disappeared into the general population in part because recusant priests largely served the great Roman Catholic houses, which alone could hide them. Without the Mass and pastoral care, yeomen, artisans and husbandmen fell into conformism. Roman Catholicism, supported by foreign or expatriate priests, came to be seen as treasonous.|$|E
