5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Washington, Mulder is admonished by Assistant Director Walter Skinner and the Smoking Man for his actions. Mulder claims he still had enough {{evidence}} with the days missed to prosecute {{the subject of his}} assigned wiretap, and that his own phone calls were being monitored. Skinner then demands that the Smoking Man leave the room, and decides to not discipline Mulder. Investigating the <b>tape</b> <b>reel,</b> Mulder finds it blank due to a power surge during the storm, but vows to continue his work regardless.|$|E
5|$|Mulder discovers a signal, {{possibly}} {{originating from}} an extraterrestrial intelligence. During a storm, Jorge gets scared and runs outside. Mulder finds him dead of fright. When Scully goes to an airport {{to fly to}} Puerto Rico, she realizes she's being tracked by a couple, but manages to escape from them. Meanwhile, as Mulder investigates Jorge's corpse, the room shakes. The door opens and the shadowy figure of an alien appears. Scully wakes Mulder up the next morning, finding him excited about the readouts and tapes of the signals—the proof of aliens he has sought for so long. However, the Blue Beret team arrives, forcing them to flee with only a <b>tape</b> <b>reel.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1970 Draheim {{also got}} {{involved}} with several musicians at what was known as Sweets Mill Music Camp, about 200 miles east of Oakland {{on the edge of}} the Sierra National Forest.

2500|$|The band's {{following}} single [...] "Itchycoo Park", {{released on}} 11 August 1967, is Small Faces' best-remembered song {{and was also}} the first of the band's two charting singles in the United States, reaching No. 16 in January 1968. The single was a bigger hit in Britain, peaking at No. 3. [...] "Itchycoo Park" [...] was the first British single to use flanging, the technique of playing two identical master tapes simultaneously but altering the speed of one of them very slightly by touching the [...] "flange" [...] of one <b>tape</b> <b>reel,</b> which yielded a distinctive comb-filtering effect. The effect had been applied by Olympic Studios engineer George Chkiantz. [...] "Itchycoo Park" [...] was followed in December 1967 by [...] "Tin Soldier", written by Marriott. Also, the track features American singer P.P. Arnold on backing vocals. The song was quite a hit reaching No. 9 on the UK charts and No. 73 on the U.S. Hot 100 chart. The Immediate Small Faces album was eventually released in the United States as There Are But Four Small Faces, with a considerable track change, including singles [...] "Here Comes The Nice", [...] "Itchycoo Park", and [...] "Tin Soldier", but eliminating several UK album tracks.|$|E

5000|$|Then {{there is}} the Magnasync Nomad, a mechanically-coupled dual-system, circa 1960. It used split-16 reels (2.5" [...] diameter, 100) of {{magnetic}} tape, sprocketed for 16mm film.

Alternatively, a 24 fps sync electric motor docks to the Nomad, and turns the camera gears. A connected external amplifier and control handset connects to the Nomad.
