Uniquely among the accused, Alizon was confronted in court by her alleged victim, John Law. She seems to have genuinely believed in her own guilt; when Law was brought into court Alizon fell <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> in tears and confessed. She was found guilty.|$|E
5|$|Oviri {{has long}} blonde or grey hair {{reaching}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees.</b> Her head and eyes are disproportionately large, she has adolescent breasts, while the aperture {{at the back}} of her head resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a wolf cub to her hip, a symbol of her indifference and wild power. It is not clear whether Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eugène Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.|$|E

25|$|This national-patriotic {{movement}} {{charges that}} for centuries the West has plundered Russia of her natural resources, {{trying to bring}} Russia <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> and undermining Russia's messianic and self-sacrificing mission to enlighten and save mankind, {{with the collapse of}} the Soviet Union as evidence. In their view, the United States want to break up Russia and turn it into a source of raw materials. The West being accused of Russophobia is a major part of their belief.|$|E

25|$|Julie Foudy, Kristine Lilly, and the 1999 team {{started a}} {{revolution}} towards women's team sports in America. Arguably their most influential and memorable victory {{came in the}} 1999 World Cup when they defeated China 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out following a 0–0 draw after extended time. With this win they emerged onto the world stage and brought significant media attention to women's soccer and athletics. On July 10, 1999, over 90,000 people (the largest ever for a women's sporting event {{and one of the}} largest attendances in the world for a tournament game final) filled the Rose Bowl to watch the United States play China in the Final. After a back and forth game, the score was tied 0–0 at full-time, and remained so after extra time, leading to a penalty kick shootout. With Briana Scurry's save of China's third kick, the score was 4–4 with only Brandi Chastain left to shoot. She scored and won the game for the United States. Chastain famously dropped <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> and whipped off her shirt, celebrating in her sports bra, which later made the cover of Sports Illustrated and the front pages of newspapers around the country and world. This win influenced girls to want to play soccer on a team.|$|E

The video is set against a strikingly designed, vividly colored setting of video screens and partitions. Houston's hair is dyed a honey color, and is held up by a dazzling colored bow. She is also seen accented by a tight, sleeveless gray dress made of metal mesh, reaching almost <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees,</b> accessorized with matching arm-bracelets.

Germany's refusal to respond to the counterproposal worsened relations between the countries.

According to Grant, the tour {{proved to be a}} [...] "very unpleasant one". Jerusalem, during this time, was ruled by the Turkish Ottoman Empire, was run down and in poor condition, populated by 20,000 people, half of whose citizens were Jewish. Six inches of snow that covered the poorly conditioned streets did not help the travelers' impressions of the city. Grant met with a delegation of American Jews who distributed relief to other suffering Jews in the Holy Land, where Grant promised to relate their message and appeal for help to Jewish leaders in the United States. While visiting the various religious sites, Julia at times was emotionally overcome with religious and spiritual sentiments, dropping <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> in prayer in one instance, while Grant remained mostly reserved with any such expression. Grant was unimpressed by Jerusalem's holy relics and agreed with Twain's assessment, regarding them as [...] "side-shows" [...] and [...] "unseemly impostures".|$|E
