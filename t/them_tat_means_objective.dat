The study includes the use of both analysis and decision models. The design objectives are modeled using a fundamental objectives hierarchy and a <b>means</b> <b>objectives</b> network. Our fundamental objective is to maximize the research value of the rover via the suspension system by maximizing the safety of passengers and equipment. The <b>means</b> <b>objectives</b> which contribute to maximizing the safety of equipment are the focus of this study and include maximizing energy dissipation, minimizing vibrations caused by the terrain, and minimizing the vertical travel of the payload.

The measures of effectiveness for these <b>means</b> <b>objectives</b> include the vertical displacement, the upward and downward acceleration, and the settling time of the rover body.

These are mean-ends chains and value-focused thinking. The research that follows describes the development of a model to identify factors that influence value judgments of citizens. Based on the data of 21 0 responses from e-government service users, two instruments were developed to measure perceived e-government value.

Measures that influence the success of Internet commerce has been studied by Torkzadeh and Dhillon (2002) based on the <b>means</b> <b>objectives</b> and fundamental objectives that were identified by Keeney (1999). However, those measures are developed for general oneto-one business-to-customer electronic commerce and do not include specific characteristics of infomediaries.

40|$|In {{this note}} {{we show that}} {{multiple}} solutions exist for the production-inventory example in the seminal paper on adjustable robust optimization in Ben-Tal et al. (Math Program 99 (2) : 351 – 376, 2004). All these optimal robust solutions have the same worst-case objective value, but the <b>mean</b> <b>objective</b> values differ up to 21. 9 % and for individual realizations this difference can be up to 59. 4 %. We show via additional experiments that these differences in performance become negligible when using a folding horizon approach. The aim {{of this paper is}} to convince users of adjustable robust optimization to check for existence of multiple solutions. Using the production-inventory example and an illustrative toy example we deduce three important implications of the existence of multiple optimal robust solutions. First, if one neglects this existence of multiple solutions, then one can wrongly conclude that the adjustable robust solution does not outperform the nonadjustable robust solution. Second, even when it is a priori known that the adjustable and nonadjustable robust solutions are equivalent on worst-case objective value, they might still differ on the <b>mean</b> <b>objective</b> value. Third, even if it is known that affine decision rules yield (near) optimal performance in the adjustable robust optimization setting, then still nonlinear decision rules can yield much better <b>mean</b> <b>objective</b> values...|$|R

On analysis of variance, the groups differed significantly on household objects, TAT(total morphemes), temporal and spatial relationships and vocabulary. Obsessive compulsive neurotics, paranoid schizophrenics and anxiety neurotics scored highest while chronic schizophrenics and MDP scored lowest on these subtests. The study thus suggests that these illnesses may be phenomenological correlates {{of high and low}} linguistic competence, respectively.

The first help businesses deliver what is important for customers so that the customers 2 ̆ 7 objectives are achieved. Fundamental objectives represent ultimate values that customers care about and will influence their overall satisfaction. Using a sample of 620 responses in a two-phase exploratory study, two of the authors previously developed a 5 -factor 21 -item instrument to measure <b>means</b> <b>objectives</b> and a 4 -factor 16 -item instrument to measure fundamental objectives. They also proposed a second-order model of the fundamental objectives as a measure of overall customer satisfaction.

40|$|Real-world {{problems}} often involve {{complex systems}} that cannot be perfectly modeled or identified, and many engineering applications aim to design operators that can perform reliably {{in the presence}} of such uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian framework for objective-based uncertainty quantification (UQ), which quantifies the uncertainty in a given system based on the expected increase of the operational cost that it induces. This measure of uncertainty, called MOCU (<b>mean</b> <b>objective</b> cost of uncertainty), provides a practical way of quantifying the effect of various types of system uncertainties on the operation of interest. Furthermore, the proposed UQ framework provides a general mathematical basis for designing robust operators, and it can be applied to diverse applications, including robust filtering, classification, and control. We demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of the proposed framework by applying it to the problem of robust structural intervention of gene regulatory networks, an important application in translational genomics.

40|$|Knowledge sharing has {{presented}} {{a challenge for}} organizations in the 21 st century. Tangible organizational assets decrease in value when they are used while knowledge increases in value as they are used. Sharing knowledge has enabled organizations to obtain a competitive advantage. A large part of knowledge sharing research is technical in nature with limited consideration of the human and individual challenges that encompass each organization. This exploratory research presents an understanding of knowledge sharing {{in the terms of}} individual values of people in a closed information organization. The organizational entity that was studied is within the United States Federal Government. The research questions attempted to understand (1) what role individual values played towards maximizing knowledge sharing, and to identify what were the (2) fundamental, and (3) <b>means</b> <b>objectives</b> in a closed information environment organization. The goals were achieved by operationalizing the value-focused thinking methodology to identify fundamental objectives for knowledge sharing and means of achieving them in an organizational context. Data for the study was collected through in-depth interviews with organizational stakeholders about their values toward maximizing knowledge sharing. A comprehensive individual value hierarchy was created through 33 interviews of closed information environment organizational personnel. This resulted in a total of 141 individual values towards maximizing knowledge sharing in a closed information environment organization. Analysis of the data provided suggestions and objectives that were essential in knowledge sharing and the broader context of knowledge management. The validated fundamental and <b>means</b> <b>objectives</b> discovered for the closed information environment organization provide a theoretical foundation and value hierarchy for maximizing knowledge sharing. Understanding values of individual stakeholders enabled the creation of objectives that leveraged, but not solely depended upon technology, as the solution. A total of 10 fundamental and 14 <b>means</b> <b>objectives</b> were identified. The results provided a theoretical framework and value hierarchy for considering knowledge sharing in a manner that accounts for content and relational epistemological issues.
