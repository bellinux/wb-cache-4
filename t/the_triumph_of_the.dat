5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} season, the 1945–46 {{season was}} a complete loss for Kennedy. He {{got off to a}} slow start, beginning the season at right wing before being returned to his center position and he also fell ill. By January Kennedy had only 5 points in 21 games and was then lost {{for the rest of the}} season due to an injury to his foot, when a Boston Bruin player's skate dug into his boot. With the Leafs also losing Captain Syl Apps to injury Toronto missed the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|In September 1955, {{the sole}} {{remaining}} Pulqui II prototype was pressed into {{action in the}} Revolución Libertadora, a coup d'état led by General Eduardo Lonardi against Perón. The exact details of its participation are unknown, but when rebel forces commanded by Lonardi captured Córdoba as their first conquest, together with the Meteor F 4s fighter-bombers stationed at the Córdoba Escuela De Aviación - SACE (Military Aviation School), the IAe 33 was enlisted in the struggle.

5|$|Manitoba's early economy {{depended}} on mobility and {{living off the}} land. Aboriginal Nations (Cree, Ojibwa, Dene, Sioux and Assiniboine) followed herds of bison and congregated to trade among themselves at key meeting places throughout the province. After {{the arrival of the}} first European traders in the 17th century, the economy centred on the trade of beaver pelts and other furs. Diversification of the economy came when Lord Selkirk brought the first agricultural settlers in 1811, though <b>the</b> <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) over its competitors ensured the primacy of the fur trade over widespread agricultural colonization.|$|E
5|$|A Hero's Song is musically {{structured}} like a four-movement symphony, {{beginning with}} an allegro con fuoco, transitioning {{to a slow}} poco adagio lacrimosa, then including a scherzo and concluding with a coda. The piece {{is based on a}} short, energetic theme in B minor played in the violas, cellos, and basses {{at the start of the}} piece. This theme is featured in various forms throughout the first section. Following this, a slow section is marked by quiet music which symbolizes the hero's grief. It includes a funeral march, a musical form Dvořák also used in his Requiem, Stabat Mater, and Piano Quintet No. 2. The hero recovers from his grief as the mood of the music gradually brightens and goes into B major, leading into the dance-like scherzo. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hero is represented by the victorious coda. The piece has a run time of approximately 22 minutes.|$|E
