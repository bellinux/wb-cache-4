40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{dramatic}} developments in the technology of intense pulsed light sources in the THz frequency range. Since many dipole-active excitations in solids and molecules also lie in this range, {{there is now a}} tremendous potential to use these light sources to study linear and nonlinear dynamics in such systems. While several experimental investigations of THz-driven dynamics in solid-state systems have demonstrated a variety of interesting linear and nonlinear phenomena, comparatively few efforts have been made <b>to</b> drive <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamics</b> in molecular systems. In the present Perspective article, we discuss the similarities and differences between THz-driven dynamics in solid-state and molecular systems on both conceptual and practical levels. We also discuss the experimental parameters needed for these types of experiments and thereby provide design criteria for a further development of this new research branch. Finally, we present a few recent examples to illustrate the rich physics that may be learned from nonlinear THz excitations of phonons in solids as well as inter-molecular vibrations in liquid and gas-phase systems...|$|R

Spatial statistics are frequently used in ecological studies to infer complex relations including predator–prey, resource dependency and co-evolution. Recently, the emerging field of computational pathology has enabled high-throughput spatial analysis by using image processing to identify different cell types and their locations within histological tumor samples. We discuss how these data may be analyzed with spatial statistics used in ecology to reveal patterns and advance our understanding of ecological interactions occurring among cancer cells and their microenvironment...|$|R
40|$|Above a {{critical}} surface chemistry-dependent particle loading associated with nanoscale interparticle spacing, ligand-ligand interactions-both electrostatic and steric-come into play and govern {{the structure and}} dynamics of charged oligomer-functionalized nanoparticle suspensions. We report in particular on the structure, ion transport, and rheology of suspensions of nanoparticle salts created by cofunctionalization of silica particles with tethered sulfonate salts and oligomers. Dispersion of the hairy ionic particles into medium and high dielectric constant liquids yields electrolytes with unique structure and transport properties. We find that electrostatic repulsion imparted by ion dissociation can be tuned to control the dispersion state and rheology through counterion size (i. e., Li+, Na+, and K+) and dielectric properties of the dispersing medium. Analysis of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) structure factors and the mechanical modulus shows that when the interparticle spacing approaches nanometer dimensions, weakly entangled anchored ligands experience strong and long-lived topological constraints <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> those normally found in well-entangled polymeric fluids. This finding provides insight into the molecular origins of the surprisingly similar rubbery plateau moduli observed in hairy nanoparticle suspensions and entangled polymers of the same chemistry as the tethered ligands. Additionally, we find that a time-composition superposition (TCS) principle exists for the suspensions, {{which can be used}} to substantially extend the observation time over which dynamics are observed in jammed, soft glassy suspensions. Application of TCS reveals dynamical similarities between the suspensions and entangled solutions of linear polymer chains; i. e., a hairy particle trapped in a cage appears <b>to</b> exhibit <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamics</b> <b>to</b> a long polymer chain confined to a tube. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|R

This problem is mathematically <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> the <b>dynamics</b> interface for convection in porous media, where the free boundary evolves between fluids with different temperature. We {{find a new}} formula for the evolution equation of the free boundary parameterized as a function in the periodic case. In this formula there is no a principal value in the non-local integral operator involved in the equation, giving a simpler system. Using this formulation, we perform numerical simulations in the stable case (denser fluid below) which show a strong regularity effect in the periodic interface.

40|$|Vacuum Einstein {{equations}} when {{projected on}} {{to a black}} hole horizon is <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> the <b>dynamics</b> of fluids. In this work we address the question, whether certain properties of semi-classical black holes could be holographically mapped into properties of (2 + 1) -dimensional fluid living on the horizon. In particular, {{we focus on the}} statistical mechanical description of the horizon-fluid that leads to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Within the paradigm of Landau mean field theory and existence of a condensate at a critical temperature, we explicitly show that Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and other features of black hole thermodynamics can be recovered from the statistical modelling of the fluid. We also show that a negative cosmological constant acts like an external magnetic field that induces order in the system leading to the appearance of a tri-critical point in the phase diagram.

40|$|Anti-lock {{braking systems}} {{are one of}} the most {{important}} safety systems for wheeled vehicles. They reduce the braking distance and, most importantly, help the user maintain controllability and steerability of the vehicle. This paper extends and adapts the concept of Anti-lock braking systems to tracked vehicles, specifically to snowmobiles. Snowmobiles are an interesting development platform for two main reasons: 1) track <b>dynamics,</b> despite being <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> tire <b>dynamics,</b> present important differences that help understanding the features of the control algorithm and 2) snowmobiles are simple and rugged vehicles with a limited set of sensors, making the design of an effective control system challenging. The paper designs a track-deceleration based ABS algorithm and tests it both in straight riding and cornering. The analysis shows that, on snowmobiles, Anti-lock braking systems have negligible advantages in term of stopping distance, but are beneficial in terms of steerability and stability, during cornering...|$|R
40|$|We {{simulate}} {{the dynamics of}} a disordered interacting spin-chain subject to a quasi-periodic time-dependent drive, corresponding to a stroboscopic Fibonacci sequence of two distinct Hamiltonians. Exploiting the recursive drive structure, we can efficiently simulate exponentially long times. After an initial transient, the system exhibits a long-lived glassy regime characterized by a logarithmically slow growth of entanglement and decay of correlations <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> the <b>dynamics</b> at the many-body delocalization transition. Ultimately, at long time-scales, which diverge exponentially for weak or rapid drives, the system thermalizes to infinite temperature. The slow relaxation enables metastable dynamical phases, exemplified by a "time quasi-crystal" in which spins exhibit persistent oscillations with a distinct quasi-periodic pattern {{from that of the}} drive. We show that in contrast with Floquet systems, a high-frequency expansion strictly breaks down above fourth order, and fails to produce an effective static Hamiltonian that would capture the pre-thermal glassy relaxation.

40|$|The {{controversial}} {{problem of}} an isolated system with an internal adiabatic wall is investigated {{with the use}} of a simple microscopic model and the Boltzmann equation. In the case of two infinite volume one-dimensional ideal fluids separated by a piston whose mass is equal to the mass of the fluid particles we obtain a rigorous explicit stationary non-equilibrium solution of the Boltzmann equation. It is shown that at equal pressures on both sides of the piston, the temperature difference induces a non-zero average velocity, oriented toward the region of higher temperature. It thus turns out that despite the absence of macroscopic forces the asymmetry of fluctuations results in a systematic macroscopic motion. This remarkable effect is <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> the <b>dynamics</b> of stochastic ratchets, where fluctuations conspire with spatial anisotropy to generate direct motion. However, a different mechanism is involved here. The relevance of the discovered motion to the adiabatic piston problem is discussed. Comment: 14 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

40|$|Learning {{discrete}} Markov random fields (MRFs) {{has been}} an important yet challenging machine learning task. In general, learning Markov random fields (MRF) is intractable due to the presence of partition function. Persistent contrastive divergence (PCD), known as a state-of-the-art learning algorithm for Markov random fields (MRFs), is a Robbins-Monro’s stochastic approx-imation procedure (SAP) with Gibbs sampling as transitions (Salakhutdinov, 2010). We conduct an empirical study on a SAP with an alternative transition: binary Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Ususally sampling-based method (e. g. Markov chain Monte Carlo) is employed for approximation. However, when the disibution exhibts multiple modes, the standard Metropplois algorithm will lead to low mxing rate of Markov chains. Hamil-tonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Metropolis algorithm with a pro-posal distribution <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> Hamiltonian <b>dynamics.</b> Compared to random walk in the standard Metropolis algorithm, HMC can propose a distant jump while still preserving a high acceptance rate. Suppose that we are interested in sampling from p(x) (where x ∈ RD). An auxiliary variable q ∈ RD with q ∼ N (q; 0,M) is introduced (usually M = c · ID). A Hamiltonian function can be constructed as: H(x,q) = U(x) +K(q) (1) where U(x), K(q) are negative logarithms of p(x) and p(q). The changes of x and q over time ν are: ẋ(ν) ...|$|R
