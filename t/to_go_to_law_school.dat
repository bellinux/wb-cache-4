[...] That changes when Ta sees her in a Western dress ("Like a God").|$|E

2500|$|Degas {{began to}} paint early in life. By {{the time he}} {{graduated}} from the Lycée with a baccalauréat in literature in 1853, at age 18, he had turned a room in his home into an artist's studio. Upon graduating, he registered as a copyist in The Louvre Museum, but his father expected him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> <b>school.</b> Degas duly enrolled at the Faculty of Law of the University of Paris in November 1853, but applied little effort to his studies. In 1855 he met Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, whom Degas revered and whose advice he never forgot: [...] "Draw lines, young man, and still more lines, both from life and from memory, and you will become a good artist." [...] In April of that year Degas was admitted to the École des Beaux-Arts. He studied drawing there with Louis Lamothe, under whose guidance he flourished, following the style of Ingres. In July 1856, Degas traveled to Italy, where he would remain for the next three years. In 1858, while staying with his aunt's family in Naples, he made the first studies for his early masterpiece The Bellelli Family. He also drew and painted numerous copies of works by Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, and other Renaissance artists, but—contrary to conventional practice—he usually selected from an altarpiece a detail that had caught his attention: a secondary figure, or a head which he treated as a portrait.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} a school in Ilkley dates from 1575, with {{an examination of the}} religious beliefs of one Constantine Harrison, schoolmaster, by the church. An endowment of £100 was made by George Marshall in 1601 to fund the salary of a schoolmaster - at the time, one William Lobley. Payments to Lobley were fitful, and the executors of Marshall's estate had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> rectify the situation; the date of settlement of the issues - 1607 - is now taken as the date of origination of the school.|$|R

If ever there was a good will in the world, the will of your Uncle Brooke was good. They could talk, and malign me, and tell lies as to dates, and strive to make my name odious in the county; but they knew that the will was good. They did not succeed very well in what they did attempt." ...|$|R

5000|$|He {{said the}} LSAT and law school went well, {{but the actual}} work as a lawyer was not an option.

50|$|Grieve {{was the son}} of Richard Grieve, an attorney, of Alnwick, by Elizabeth Davidson. Both Richard and the grandfather, Ralph, a merchant, {{had been}} {{prominent}} at Alnwick in political contests, and George's elder brother, Davidson Richard, was high sheriff of Northumberland in 1788. Grieve, on coming of age, had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> with the corporation to take up his freedom, their plea being that his father, who had died in 1765 at the age of eighty-four, had been temporarily disfranchised at the time of George's birth.|$|R
6000|$|But {{there now}} {{remained}} in question a trifling {{sum of money}} which a Mr. Liar loudly demanded in payment of an [...] "affair of honour."

50|$|In December 1532 Thomas Wood accused Neville of treason, alleging he had prophesied the King's death, {{and that}} he himself would become Earl of Warwick. In {{addition}} there were other allegations that Neville had dabbled in magic, including the claim {{that at one time}} 'he tried to make himself a cloak of invisibility of two layers of linen with one between of buckskin, the whole to be treated with a mixture in which horse bones, skin, chalk, rosin and powdered glass were the chief ingredients.’ His former chaplain, Edward Legh, made similar allegations in March 1533. It appears Neville, and his brothers George and Christopher, who were also drawn into the investigation, escaped from these charges relatively unscathed. In 1534 Neville petitioned Thomas Cromwell, claiming that owing to great losses he was so impoverished that he could not afford <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> obtain redress of wrongs done to him.|$|R
