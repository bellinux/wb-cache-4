5|$|The {{following}} two lists name <b>the</b> <b>stations.</b> The first lists <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> that opened between 2002 and 2007, {{while the second}} lists those that are planned to open in 2018 or later. The first table states <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> name, which lines serve it, whether it is elevated or underground (the grade), travel time in minutes to Nørreport, the ticket zone and any transfer possibilities available at the station. The second table lists <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> on the City Circle Line, which lines are scheduled serve it and available transfers. All M3 stations will be underground.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, {{the city}} decided {{to connect the}} four {{suburban}} lines west of the city center with the Oslo Metro. The Sognsvann Line {{was selected as the}} first line to be upgraded, so the two systems would become compatible. The line was upgraded to metro standard by replacing the overhead wire with a third-rail power supply and installing automatic train protection. All <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> were rebuilt, with platforms lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains, and the platform height increased. The third rail required all level crossings to be removed, resulting in the line being rebuilt several places to allow the road to underpass or overpass. The light rail permitted passengers to cross the lines at <b>the</b> <b>stations,</b> but this was made impossible with metro standard. Because of this, underpasses or overpasses were built at <b>the</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{stations}} were {{built for the}} first stage, and five for the second stage. <b>The</b> <b>stations</b> and the visual profile of {{the system as a}} whole are designed by the Bergen-based design groups Cubus and Fuggi Baggi Design, and Copenhagen-based Kontrapunkt. <b>The</b> <b>stations</b> of the first two stages are at street level, with facilities for buying tickets and dynamic displays that show when the next tram will arrive. The platforms have step-free access to the trams, allowing unhindered accessibility by wheelchairs and perambulators.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>station</b> has one island platform, {{connected}} to <b>the</b> <b>station</b> building by a level crossing. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> building also doubles as the private residence of <b>the</b> <b>station</b> master.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>station</b> opened as Richmond on April 23, 1860, {{with the}} opening of the Staten Island Railway from Vanderbilt's Landing to Eltingville. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> was named Richmond as <b>the</b> <b>station</b> was on <b>the</b> border between Richmond and Oakwood. Afterwards, {{sometime}} around 1885 <b>the</b> <b>station</b> was renamed Court House. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> was a flag stop. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> was later renamed Oakwood, and then finally Oakwood Heights after the other neighborhood on the border of <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> A 1909 timetable calls <b>the</b> <b>station</b> Oakwood Heights, but puts Court House in parentheses.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>station</b> has two opposed side platforms, {{connected}} to <b>the</b> <b>station</b> building by a level crossing. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> building also doubles as the private residence of <b>the</b> <b>station</b> master.|$|R
5|$|Later {{installations}} {{faced the}} opposite dilemma of having too few stations: one Streetsblog writer noted that <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> in the expansions were spaced further apart than <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> {{in the original}} service area, which would make the Citi Bike stations in these areas harder to access. In September 2017, a reporter for Time Out magazine wrote that the system did not serve the outer boroughs adequately, with stations only located in wealthier areas of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens that were closer to the Manhattan central business districts.|$|E
5|$|Russia {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with Ukraine in 1992 allowing it to continue using the Dnepr radars at Sevastopol and Mukachevo. <b>The</b> <b>stations</b> were run by Ukrainian personnel and data was sent to the headquarters of the Russian early warning system in Solnechnogorsk. In 2008 Russia announced that it was pulling out of the agreement with Ukraine and that the last data given to Russia from <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> would be in 2009. The Ukrainian government announced that <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> were to be used part-time for space surveillance.|$|E
5|$|Service was {{introduced}} on 11 June 2006, with a contract lasting ten years. Along {{with the change}} of operator and stock, the Norwegian National Rail Administration, who owns <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> and tracks, did an overhaul of maintenance on many of <b>the</b> <b>stations,</b> in particular removing years of vandalism. In August, the company did a minor upgrade to the trains. The quiet sections were doubled from one to two sections, and new window shades for NOK 650,000 were purchased. By August, the ridership on the Gjøvik Line had increased by 8%, compared to the previous year.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>station</b> {{opened in}} 1848. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> is now closed, {{although}} the line running through <b>the</b> <b>station</b> remains open. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> building {{has been converted}} into a private dwelling.|$|R
50|$|Next to <b>the</b> <b>station</b> is <b>the</b> Järvenpää taxi rank. Many {{local bus}} lines stops at <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> <b>The</b> bus <b>station</b> is 300 m north of <b>the</b> <b>station.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{municipal}} government has permitted denser development around <b>the</b> <b>stations,</b> where it wants most new housing and commercial property to be built. Development projects for Slettebakken, Wergeland, Paradis and Lagunen have been announced by private developers. Many of <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> are in primarily residential areas, and the projects have met resistance from residents who {{fear that the}} character of their neighborhoods will be altered.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stations</b> {{along the}} UTA TRAX network are open-air {{structures}} featuring passenger canopies {{for protection from}} adverse weather. Many of the canopies are designed to resemble the canopy at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building (which is located Downtown and listed on the National Register of Historic Places). Works of public art included at several stations were developed {{as part of the}} UTA's Art in Transit program. At first the program was met with skepticism; initially, only <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> constructed in Salt Lake City incorporated public art into their designs. This was the case as the city was initially the only one {{to take part in the}} Art in Transit program. The program has since grown in popularity, and many of <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> constructed as part of the FrontLines 2015 expansion will include public art in their final design.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stations</b> {{are well}} {{distributed}} around the country, with some concentration in Extremadura, Castile-La Mancha and Murcia.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>station</b> {{consists}} of an island platform serving two tracks, with <b>the</b> <b>station</b> situated above <b>the</b> tracks. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> has automated ticket machines and Kitaca card readers. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> is unattended.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>station</b> {{opened in}} 1956 42 years after Hove Station was opened {{which is just}} West of <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> <b>The</b> <b>station</b> was {{destroyed}} by {{a fire in the}} 1970s and subsequently was rebuilt. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> is close to <b>the</b> Oaklands <b>station</b> East of <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> It is located on Railway Terrace, Warradale and is 13.7 kilometres from Adelaide Railway <b>Station,</b> <b>the</b> central <b>station</b> of <b>the</b> Adelaide Metro network.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>station</b> was {{assigned}} call sign WORX-FM in 1950. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> {{was owned by}} numerous families until 1980, when Dubois County Broadcasting bought <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> On January 10, 1981, <b>the</b> <b>station</b> changed its call sign to WCJC. On January 4, 1987, <b>the</b> <b>station</b> changed back to the current WORX-FM.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stations</b> partnered {{through a}} sharing {{agreement}} may also consolidate their programming operations: local newscasts on the junior {{partner in the}} LMA, if it operated a separate news department before the LMA's formation, may be rescheduled or scaled back to prevent direct competition with newscasts airing on the station acting as the senior partner (the latter aspect is less common with LMAs involving only stations affiliated {{with one of the}} three largest broadcast television networks). <b>The</b> <b>stations</b> may share news-gathering resources, but maintain separate news telecasts that are differentiated by their on-air presentation, anchors, and overall format, with varying degrees of autonomy; in these cases, a seemingly separate newscast on the brokered station in the duopoly may ultimately consist of repackaged news content from the other station. Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> may consolidate their news programming under a single joint brand.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stations</b> were in {{the heart}} of the North East coal field, which at the time of their opening had {{hundreds}} of collieries. Coal was delivered straight to <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> by rail. The Newcastle and Carlisle Railway was used for the South station, where 22railway sidings were built. Trains could only enter the sidings when travelling in a westerly direction.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stations</b> were picketed {{during the}} UK miners' strike of 1972, {{stopping}} coal deliveries to them.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>station</b> has two {{elevated}} opposed side platforms with <b>the</b> <b>station</b> building underneath. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> is unattended.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>station</b> is {{devoid of}} several basic {{amenities}} {{for several years}} now. An odd 48 sq ft room is the sole staff building in <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> which houses <b>the</b> only ticket counter of <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> There {{is no room for}} <b>the</b> <b>station</b> master or any other security staff in <b>the</b> <b>station.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>station</b> {{opened in}} 1863 by the North British Railway. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> was {{situated}} immediately north east of an unnamed minor road. A signal box and goods sidings were located near <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> <b>The</b> <b>station</b> closed to both passengers and goods traffic in 1951. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> building is still extant.|$|R
5|$|The two {{stations}} in the cemetery were very similar in design. North station served the Nonconformist section of the cemetery, and South station served the Anglican section. On William Cubitt's advice the two {{stations in}} the cemetery were built as temporary structures, in the expectation that {{they would need to}} be rebuilt once the railway was operational and the issues with operating a railway of this unique nature became clearer. Other than brick platform faces, chimneys and foundations, <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> were built entirely of wood. Each station held first class and ordinary reception rooms for mourners, a first class and an ordinary refreshment room, and a set of apartments for LNC staff. To provide an attractive first view of the cemetery for visitors arriving at <b>the</b> <b>stations,</b> the areas around <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> and their associated chapels were planted with groves of bay, Cedar of Lebanon, rhododendron and Portuguese laurel.|$|E
5|$|A planned 2013 sale of WCLG (and its sister-station WCLG-FM) by Bowers Broadcasting Corporation {{was halted}} by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) {{due to a}} {{complaint}} that the company buying <b>the</b> <b>stations,</b> AJG Corporation, has close connections with another local broadcaster, West Virginia Radio Corporation. That sale has since been completed.|$|E
5|$|A survey {{conducted}} by the LNWR found that the bridges and culverts were in a fair condition, but <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> were dirty. Fences were decayed, rails needed replacing, some sleepers were rotten, and the ballast was soft and shaley. The LNWR addressed these problems over the coming years.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>station</b> {{flower and}} shrub beds {{were laid out}} and are {{maintained}} by the local community enterprise charity, Antur Waunfawr.The Snowdonia Park Hotel adjoins <b>the</b> <b>station</b> and was built originally as <b>the</b> <b>station</b> master's house.Entrance to and exit from <b>the</b> <b>station</b> platform is {{by way of the}} hotel car park. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> footbridge links with a car park and a caravan park. Snowdonia Sherpa Bus services call at <b>the</b> <b>station.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>station</b> was {{assigned}} <b>the</b> call sign KSTR on 1994-03-01. On 1994-10-12, <b>the</b> <b>station</b> changed its call sign to KKGM and on 1996-09-02 to KBZS. On 1998-01-30 <b>the</b> <b>station</b> became KKGM and on 1998-08-14 KKGJ. On 1998-12-04 <b>the</b> <b>station</b> returned to KSTR and on 1999-03-15 changed again to KRDY. On 2000-08-07 <b>the</b> <b>station</b> changed back to KSTR, and finally on 2001-04-23 <b>the</b> <b>station</b> became <b>the</b> current call letters: KJOL.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>station</b> began {{broadcasting}}, it had {{a country}} music format. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> began broadcasting in 1980 as KPAR. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> suffered financial problems and became a daytime only <b>station</b> in 1986. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> changed its call letters to KPIR in 2002. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> is now a 24-hour news and talk operation.|$|R
5|$|After {{the closure}} of Dunston Staithes in 1980, the Swing Bridge {{downstream}} of <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> seldom had to be opened. (Because Bessie Surtees was low lying, {{it was able to}} pass underneath the bridge at low tide.) However, on 15 December 1975, Bessie Surtees collided with the Swing Bridge, forcing it to close for the rest of that weekend.|$|E
5|$|All <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> {{along the}} line were {{designed}} by Paul Armin Due, with all but the terminal station built in wood. Flekkefjord Station was built as a three-story brick building in Art Nouveau. In addition, there was construction a depot and a wharf at Flekkefjord. Passengers could transfer to steam ship services that operated eastwards along the south coast towards Oslo.|$|E
5|$|Although {{developed}} by the British Electricity Authority, <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> were first operated by the Central Electricity Authority, following the Electricity Reorganisation (Scotland) Act 1954. From 1957 they were operated by the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), following the Electricity Act 1957.|$|E
