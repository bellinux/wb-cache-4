60|$|To {{make matters}} worse, doctors are hideously poor. The Irish gentleman doctor of my boyhood, who took {{nothing less than}} a guinea, though he might pay you four visits for it, seems to have no {{equivalent}} nowadays in English society. Better be a railway porter than an ordinary English general practitioner. A railway porter has from eighteen to twenty-three shillings a week from the Company merely as a retainer; and his additional fees from the public, if we leave the third-class twopenny <b>tip</b> <b>out</b> of account (and I am by no means sure that even this reservation need be made), are equivalent to doctor's fees in the case of second-class passengers, and double doctor's fees in the case of first. Any class of educated men thus treated tends to become a brigand class, and doctors are no exception to the rule. They are offered disgraceful prices for advice and medicine. Their patients are for the most part so poor and so ignorant that good advice would be resented as impracticable and wounding. When you are so poor that you cannot afford to refuse eighteenpence from a man who is too poor to pay you any more, it is useless to tell him that what he or his sick child needs is not medicine, but more leisure, better clothes, better food, and a better drained and ventilated house. It is kinder to give him a bottle of something almost as cheap as water, and tell him to come again with another eighteenpence if it does not cure him. When you have done that over and over again every day for a week, how much scientific conscience have you left? If you are weak-minded enough to cling desperately to your eighteenpence as denoting a certain social superiority to the sixpenny doctor, you will be miserably poor all your life; whilst the sixpenny doctor, with his low prices and quick turnover of patients, visibly makes much more than you do and kills no more people.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{observe the}} intracochlear {{behavior}} of a cochlear implant electrode insertion technique (called “pullback”) in temporal bones. Study Design. Experimental. Settings. Tertiary referral center. Method. The change of the intracochlear electrode position was investigated under various conditions of an electrode pullback (N= 54) in 9 radiologically, size-estimated temporal bones (TBs). Those TBs were prepared by removal of the cochlear scalar roof to apply digital video capture procedures to monitor the pullback procedures. The digitally captured pictures were analyzed with specific software. Results. An optimal pullback of the electrode varied between 1. 37 [*]mm and 2. 67 [*]mm. While a limited pullback is without risk, an extended pullback bears the risk of removing the electrode <b>tip</b> <b>out</b> of its initial position {{or out of the}} cochlea. A correlation between cochlear size and the amount of pullback was not found. Conclusion. An initial insertion to the first or the second marker on the electrode followed by a limited pullback of about 1. 37 [*]mm to 1. 5 [*]mm can be recommended to achieve an optimized perimodiolar position.

In six cases, the accidents were fatal. This underlines that direct morcellation injuries are serious and, though underreported, extremely rare.

40|$|Nanometer-scale {{friction}} {{measurements on}} a Au(111) surface {{have been performed}} at temperatures between 30 and 300 K by means of atomic force microscopy. Stable stick slip with atomic periodicity is observed at all temperatures, showing only weak dependence on temperature between 300 and 170 K. Below 170 K, friction increases with time and a distortion of the stick-slip characteristic is observed. Low friction and periodic stick slip can be reestablished by pulling the <b>tip</b> <b>out</b> of contact and subsequently restoring the contact. A comparison with molecular dynamics simulations indicates that plastic deformation within a growing gold junction leads to the observed frictional behavior at low temperatures.

40|$|Nanoprobes {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components in several fields of nanoscience to study materials, molecules and particles. In scanning probe microscopes, the nanoprobes consist on silicon tips coated with thin metallic films to provide additional properties, such as conductivity. However, if the experiments involve high currents or lateral frictions, the initial properties of the tips can wear out very fast. One possible solution is the use of hard coatings, such as diamond, or making the entire <b>tip</b> <b>out</b> of a precious material (platinum or diamond). However, this strategy is more expensive and the diamond coatings can damage the samples. In this context, the use of graphene as a protective coating for nanoprobes has attracted considerable interest.

40|$|Abstract: Microelectrode {{recordings}} of single unit neuronal activity were used during stereotactic surgery {{to define the}} subthalamic nucleus for chronic deep brain stimulation {{in the treatment of}} Parkinson’s disease. By using five parallel trajec-tories, often two to three microelectrodes allow us to recognize subthalamic nucleus (STN) neuronal activity. STN neurons were easily distinguished from cells of the overlying zona in-certa and the underlying substantia nigra. During a typical ex-ploratory track, we can observe a very low background noise in the zona incerta and almost complete absence of single cell recording. Penetration of the electrode tip into the STN is char-acterized by a sudden increase in background activity and single cell activity of spontaneously active neurons. The exit of electrode <b>tip</b> <b>out</b> of the STN corresponds to a decrease in back-ground noise and a loss of single cell activity. Spontaneou...|$|E

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that high pressures are generated at the tips of laparoscopic graspers, which can cause tissue injury. This study examines the effect of a compliant edge on tip pressure. Methods: One of a pair of identical laparoscopic graspers was modified by refashioning the <b>tip</b> <b>out</b> of silicone. A thin film pressure transducer (I-scan 6900 sensor) was deployed between the jaws of the grasper and a simulated tissue (leather strap). Load and handle pressures were kept constant. Peak tip pressure readings were taken as the load orientation was increased from the perpendicular to 135 ° (n = 10). The data was analysed using ANOVA and a post-hoc Duncan's multiple range test. Results: Peak tip pressures generated by the compliant tipped grasper were significantly less than those developed by the unmodified grasper, particularly at high-load orientations. Conclusion: High pressures generated at the tip of laparoscopic graspers can be reduced by altering the mechanical properties (compliance) of the tip. 3 page(s...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTransient mixed-mode elastodynamic {{crack growth}} along {{arbitrary}} smoothly varying paths in functionally graded materials (FGMs) is considered.

Crack <b>tip</b> <b>out</b> of plane displacement fields and their gradients are developed for propagating curved cracks of arbitrary velocity using asymptotic approach. The mode-mixity due to the inclination of curved crack with respect to property gradient is accommodated in the analysis through superposition of the opening and shear modes. The expansion of the displacement fields and their gradients around the crack-tip are derived in powers of radial coordinates with the coefficients of expansion depending on the instantaneous value of the local curvature of the crack path, time derivatives of crack-tip speed, and time derivative of mode-I and mode-II stress intensity factors. The effect of the transient terms instantaneous local curvature, crack-tip speed, time derivatives of crack-tip speed, and time derivative of mode-I and mode-II stress intensity factors on the contours of constant out of plane displacement are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Turbocharging {{is used as}} a means to {{downsize}} petrol engines, thereby, producing more power for a lower engine size, when compared with a naturally aspirated engine. The introduction of a turbocharger means that a throttle body is included in the petrol engine downstream of the turbocharger compressor. Due to the presence of this throttle valve, flow is restricted through the outlet pipe of the turbocharger during low load engine operation. For example, during transient <b>tip</b> <b>out</b> – tip in maneuvers. Hence, there is a chance of the turbocharger operating in near surge or surge conditions. Surge noise generated during this stage is clearly audible and can also affect the durable life of the compressor and other rotor systems of the turbocharger. This paper describes an experimental method to predict and measure the turbocharger surge noise. An experimental turbocharger noise rig, designed and built for this purpose, is explained. Using a time and frequency analysis of the measured data the fundamental mechanism of noise generation is identified. Finally, a passive solution to reduce the surge noise is proposed...|$|E

40|$|We report {{our studies}} of {{epitaxial}} growth of CoCrTa films on Cr underlayers and {{the properties of}} CoCrTa/Cr multilayers. The coercivity, Hc, strongly depends on Ta composition, sputtering conditions, and the thicknesses of the magnetic layer and Cr underlayer. An Hcvalue of 1300 Oe was obtained for a Ta composition of 2 at. %, a Cr underlayer thickness of 4000 Å, and a magnetic layer thickness of 400 Å. The x-ray data show that the high Hc occurs when crystallites of the Cr underlayer and CoCrTa layer are aligned with the Cr (200) and CoCrTa (110) planes in the film plane. Thus, the c axis of the CoCrTa lies essentially in {{the plane of the}} film. When the thickness of the magnetic layer increases above 1000 Å the c axis begins to <b>tip</b> <b>out</b> of the film plane. The basal plane lattice parameter varies roughly linearly with Ta content up to 13 at. %. For the CoCrTa/Cr multilayered films, Hc values up to 1200 Oe were obtained although the c-axis orientation of the magnetic layer becomes somewhat dispersed. Models for the dependence of magnetization reversal on microstructure are discussed. Journal of Applied Physics is copyrighted by The American Institute of Physics.

40|$|Long-distance {{transport}} {{is crucial}} for polar growing cells, such as neurons and fungal hyphae. Kinesins and myosins participate in this, but their functional interplay is poorly understood. Here we investigate the role of kinesin motors in hyphal growth of the plant pathogen Ustilago maydis. Although the microtubule plus-ends are directed to the hyphal <b>tip,</b> <b>out</b> of all 10 kinesins analyzed, only conventional kinesin (Kinesin- 1), and Unc 104 /Kif 1 A-like kinesin (Kinesin- 3) were upregulated in hyphae and are essential for extended hyphal growth. Δkin 1 and Δkin 3 mutant hyphae grew irregular and remained short, but were still able to grow polarized. No additional phenotype was detected in Δkin 1 rkin 3 double mutants, but polarity was lost in Δmyo 5 rkin 1 and Δmyo 5 rkin 3 mutant cells, suggesting that kinesins and class V myosin cooperate in hyphal growth. Consistent with such a role in secretion, fusion proteins of GFP and Kinesin- 1, Myosin-V and Kinesin- 3 accumulate in the apex of hyphae, a region where secretory vesicles cluster to form the fungal Spitzenkörper. Quantitative assays revealed a role of Kin 3 in secretion of acid phosphatase, whereas Kin 1 was not involved. Our data demonstrate that just two kinesins {{and at least one}} myosin support hyphal growth. ...|$|E

Submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Turbocharging {{is used as a}} means to downsize petrol engines, thereby, producing more power for a lower engine size, when compared with a naturally aspirated engine. Due to the presence of a throttle valve in the intake system in petrol engines, flow is restricted at the outlet pipe of the compressor during low load engine operation. For example, during transient <b>tip</b> <b>out</b> tip in maneuvers. Hence, there is a chance of the turbocharger operating in near surge or surge conditions and, thus, generating surge noise. This Thesis describes an experimental and simulation method to predict and measure the turbocharger surge noise. Initially, experimental transient tip-in and tip-out maneuver was performed on a non turbocharged car with a petrol engine. The measured noise level in the intake manifold, at a low frequency of up to 1200 Hz, was analysed and was shown not to represent surge noise. Next, a one dimensional simulation method was applied to simulate the noise of the engine and this demonstrated an increase in the acoustic pressure level in the intake manifold during the tip in and <b>tip</b> <b>out</b> maneuver. However, a surge noise pattern was not observed in the analysis of acoustic pressure signals in the intake system using Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The simulation procedure was also used to inform the design of an experimental rig to recreate the surge noise under laboratory conditions. An experimental turbocharger noise rig, designed and built for this purpose, is explained in the Thesis. Important component parts likely {{to be involved in the}} surge noise generation such as the intake system, compressor, throttle body, compressor recirculation valve and measurement and control systems were integrated into the test rig. Background noise contributions from the electric motor, AC mains, supercharger pulley, throttle body, inverter fan, throttle body gearing and structural vibration of the supporting structure were identified from the analysed frequency components of the signals from surface microphone measurements taken at the intake system. This helped to clearly identify the surge noise frequency components (3250 Hz) in the STFT analysis. The fundamental mechanism of noise generation was identified using an analysis of the experimental results and a frequency calculation for vortex shedding and the radial acoustic resonances. One of the main conclusions of the Thesis is that the compressor recirculation valve (CRV) open or close position, the CRV delay time and the throttle position are major contributing factors to the cause of the surge noise. Another major conclusion is that the radial acoustic resonance may be a mechanism of surge noise generation. Finally, a passive solution to reduce the surge noise is proposed. A pipe with cross ribs is designed as a passive solution using the radial acoustic resonance calculation and the corresponding nodal patterns. This solution demonstrated a measured intake system noise reduction of up to 10 dB under compressor surge conditions...|$|E
