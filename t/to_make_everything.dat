25|$|As {{she grew}} older her {{determination}} to make literature her profession became very strong, and no discouragements ever altered her purpose. As {{she was the}} oldest of four children, her father {{did not feel that}} it would be fair to the others to give her more than her just proportion of aid, since the others might also, in time, require assistance. Consequently, when at eighteen years old Miss Booth decided that it was necessary for her work that she should be in New York, she could not depend entirely upon her father. While not disregarding any expressed wish of her parents, she made her own decision as to the chief aim of her life. She was now obliged to leave them, and in some way to earn the difference between the sum her father could allow her and her expenses, and also to find time and opportunity for that other work to which she meant <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>everything</b> subordinate.|$|E
25|$|Chenin blanc (known also as Pineau de la Loire {{among other}} names) {{is a white}} wine grape variety from the Loire Valley of France. Its high acidity means {{it can be used}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>everything</b> from {{sparkling}} wines to well-balanced dessert wines, although it can produce very bland, neutral wines if the vine's natural vigor is not controlled. Outside the Loire it is found in most of the New World wine regions; it is the most widely planted variety in South Africa, where it is also known as Steen. The grape may {{have been one of the}} first to be grown in South Africa by Jan van Riebeeck in 1655, or it may have come to that country with Huguenots fleeing France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Chenin blanc was often misidentified in Australia as well, so tracing its early history in the country is not easy. It may have been introduced in James Busby's collection of 1832, but C. Waterhouse was growing Steen at Highercombe in Houghton, South Australia by 1862.|$|E

[...] O'Donnell made sure that no part of the game would be completely silent, noting [...] "Ambient sound {{is one of the main}} ways to immerse people psychologically.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Freedom" [...] was {{directed}} by Sean De Sparengo, and filmed in London in July 2011. It took one day to film, and is primarily set in an underground club with red lighting, reminiscent of that featured in the group's 2002 single [...] "Freak like Me". De Sparengo commented on the concept and visual attributes of the video, saying: [...] "One {{of the interesting things}} for the concept for this video is that we knew we had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>everything</b> look incredibly beautiful. It was about making a video where the Sugababes felt like they were {{at the top of their}} game." [...] The video made its premiere in August 2011. A [...] clip was uploaded to the Sugababes official VEVO channel on YouTube. Daily Mirror praised the band's appearance in the video.|$|E
500|$|Rita Dhody and Narendra Kumar {{were chosen}} to style the film's characters. Dhody said it took nearly two months for UTV and Bhandarkar to persuade her to help design the film; she found the job {{challenging}} because she had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>everything</b> as authentic as possible. Chopra had to wear 137 costumes in the film because her character passed through five phases. Initially, she was a [...] "hep" [...] character with brightly coloured, matching attire. Her make-up becomes lighter as she becomes a model and later a supermodel. When her career falters, Chopra's look becomes softer, demonstrating her character's lack of concern about her appearance before she returns to Mumbai. According to Dhody, Chopra's look is [...] "very contemporary and a very much today's look, but my idea was to streamline {{and take it to}} the classic side [...] than making it trend-based".|$|E

The video premiered on December 12, 2005 on MTV, and was included on the DVD of The Pink Panther. The video was shot in 12 hours and features Beyoncé in 12 different set-ups and outfits. It incorporates 1950s influences. Hype Williams told Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly that the concept was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>everything</b> pink to brand the relationship with The Pink Panther. He added that the pink sails reflect the wind instrument sound of the string section. Speaking about the video to MTV, Beyoncé said: ...|$|E
500|$|For Storaro, {{the limited}} color palette {{was the most}} {{challenging}} aspect of production. [...] "These are {{not the kind of}} colors the audience is used to seeing," [...] he noted. [...] "These are much more dramatic in strength, in saturation. Comic strip art is usually done with very simple and primitive ideas and emotions," [...] Storaro theorized. [...] "One of the elements is that the story is usually told in vignette, so what we tried to do is never move the camera at all. Never. Try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>everything</b> work into the frame." [...] For the matte paintings, Ellenshaw and Lloyd executed over 57 paintings on glass, which were then optically combined with the live action.

In order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>everything</b> right about the future, Peter and Brian decide to sneak into the prom through a vent.

After crashing through the vent to the stage, the band begins playing [...] "Earth Angel" [...] by The Penguins, and, after Peter kisses Lois, Brian sings the 1987 single [...] "Never Gonna Give You Up" [...] by musician Rick Astley. While Brian sings [...] "Never Gonna Give You Up", Rick Astley's cousin Marvin calls him to say he's found the [...] "mediocre, generic sound" [...] that Astley has been looking for, a reference to Back to the Future.

500|$|The Viceroy of India {{had already}} warned the Emir of {{approaching}} [...] "German agents and hired assassins", and the Emir had promised he would arrest the expedition if it managed to reach Afghanistan. However, under a close watch, the expedition members {{were given the}} freedom of Herat. The governor promised to arrange for the 400-mile trip east to Kabul in another two weeks. Suits were tailored and horses given new saddles <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>everything</b> presentable for the meeting with the Emir. The southern route {{and the city of}} Kandahar were avoided, possibly because Afghan officials wished to prevent fomenting unrest in the Pathan region close to India. On 7 September, the group left Herat for Kabul with Afghan guides on a 24-day trip via the harsher northern route through Hazarajat, over the barren mountains of central Afghanistan. En route the expedition was careful to spend enough money and gold to ensure popularity amongst the local people. Finally, on 2 October 1915, the expedition reached Kabul. It was received with a salaam from the local Turkish community and a Guard of honour from Afghan troops in Turkish uniform. Von Hentig later described receiving cheers and a grand welcome from the inhabitants of Kabul.|$|E
500|$|Goal Auzeen Saedi, {{reviewing}} Keeping Up {{with the}} Kardashians for Psychology Today, emphasized the show's influence saying that: [...] "The Kardashians become more relatable the more famous they become." [...] Saedi also questioned {{their decision to}} appear on the show and added: [...] "But if living life in the spotlight is so taxing and demands multiple justifications for the way your life is being lived and criticized, perhaps you can take the cameras out of your house." [...] Vinnie Mancuso, writing for New York Observer, criticized the show and felt: [...] "roughly one iota of shadenfreudic pleasure from this endeavor, {{but for the most part}} this show is the 100% drizzling poops." [...] David Hinckley of the New York Daily News, reviewing the tenth season, said that [...] "even when you think something about the Kardashians could be interesting, it's not," [...] adding that the [...] "entertainment value [...] is like having spent 10 years in Rapid City, S.D., watching the traffic lights change." [...] Amy Amatangelo of The Hollywood Reporter said that [...] "in true Kardashian fashion, they managed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>everything</b> about them," [...] after Caitlyn Jenner came out as a trans woman to her family in the [...] "About Bruce" [...] special aired as part of the tenth season.

500|$|In an interview, Maisie Williams {{described}} the thought process behind Arya's scenes, {{as well as}} the process of filming saying [...] "We wanted people to think this could be the end, or the start of the end. Like maybe her wound is going to fester – like The Hound." [...] She continued, [...] "There was this constant spectrum of conversation with Mark Mylod during the chase of about how petrified she needs to look, but also how safe she is. Arya's been very lucky with the people she's encountered so far. The whole time she was with The Hound she took a back seat because he was really good. So I wanted her to look like she was struggling." [...] Williams also stated that she gave input on how the scene should take place, stating [...] "I didn't want the chase stunt to be unnecessary or superhuman. I got on set {{and they were going to}} have Arya rolling around, and diving, and I was like, [...] "That looks amazing, but no." [...] I'd be like, [...] "Why would she run over there? She'd just duck under here and just get out." [...] It doesn’t look quite as cinematic, maybe, but they'll have to find something else if they want cinematic. And I felt awful because the job of the stunt guys is <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>everything</b> look as crazy and cool as possible. But I know Arya now. In the beginning it was a lot of guesswork and now I've figured her out." ...|$|E

500|$|Joan O'Connell Hedman of Slant Magazine {{also gave}} a {{positive}} review feeling the episode to explore [...] "Torchwoods {{bread and butter}} topic: {{the intersection of the}} human and the alien, {{and what it means to}} be human in the aftermath." [...] She stated that the episode [...] "played to its strengths, namely Eve Myles' Gwen and how she relates to both human and alien" [...] and stated it to demonstrate [...] "how perfect Rhys is for Gwen". She felt that the episode was flawed in its [...] "cop-out" [...] ending and Jack's handling of Gwen but in her conclusion noted it be [...] "the first episode of Torchwood that left me choked up, crying with Gwen at the end". Airlock Alpha's Alan Stanley Blair felt the episode to be a vast improvement on its predecessors stating it be [...] "hard hitting, edgy and explores much bleaker and darker avenues to life in Torchwood". He also felt that the personal effect of Gwen's struggles on her domestic life was one of the most interesting aspects comparing it to the television series Angel which [...] "touched on some of these threads through the meta-story and vampire mythology" [...] but not [...] "on the scale of this [...] ". He concluded that the episode's conclusion was both to its credit and its biggest disappointment because it showed that there is [...] "no way <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>everything</b> all right" [...] but left its audience [...] "screaming for a happy ending that will never come". Jason Hughes of AOL TV was more mixed in his review. He felt that the episode was a [...] "vast improvement over last week's episode" [...] and stated that it lived up to Torchwoods reputation as [...] "the darker, more mature cousin of Doctor Who". However, he stated that the episode had [...] "some logistical problems" [...] and [...] "at least one ridiculously convenient coincidence that the emotional hook of the episode hinged on". He praised the [...] "tragic emotional impact of the moment when Jonah's mom told Gwen to promise her not to do that to any other families" [...] and stated that he liked [...] "that there weren't any easy answers". io9's Charlie Jane Anders described [...] "Adrift" [...] as [...] "easily the best episode of the Doctor Who spin-off since the one where Martha Jones showed up". She stated that [...] "the fact that it offered no easy solutions and gave us that super-bleak ending was enough to win me over".|$|E
