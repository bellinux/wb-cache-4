40|$|This paper {{introduces}} TripNet, {{a robotic}} vision system that detects <b>trip</b> <b>hazards</b> using raw construction site images. Automated detection of dangers such as <b>trip</b> <b>hazards</b> is difficult. <b>Trip</b> <b>hazards</b> {{are not entirely}} defined by an object type, rather <b>trip</b> <b>hazards</b> are affordances typically learnt from time consuming intrusive interaction with an environment and its objects. TripNet performs <b>trip</b> <b>hazard</b> identification using only camera imagery and minimal training with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) rapidly �ne-tuned on a small corpus of labelled image regions from construction sites. There is no reliance on prior scene segmentation methods during deployment. TripNet achieves comparable performance to a human on a dataset recorded in two distinct real world construction sites. TripNet exhibits spatial and temporal generalization by functioning in previously unseen parts of a construction site and over time periods of several weeks. The dataset is published to stimulate further research in this area. This research is a significant step towards automating detection of hazards on construction sites, where a substantial proportion of all workplace related injuries occur...|$|R

40|$|<b>Trip</b> <b>hazards</b> are a {{significant}} contributor to accidents on construction and manufacturing sites, where {{over a third of}} Australian workplace injuries occur [1]. Current safety inspections are labour intensive and limited by human fallibility, making automation of <b>trip</b> <b>hazard</b> detection appealing from both a safety and economic perspective. <b>Trip</b> <b>hazards</b> present an interesting challenge to modern learning techniques because they are defined as much by affordance as by object type; for example wires on a table are not a <b>trip</b> <b>hazard,</b> but can be if lying on the ground. To address these challenges, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the performance characteristics of 11 different colour and depth fusion approaches, including 4 fusion and one non fusion approach; using colour and two types of depth images. Trained and tested on over 600 labelled <b>trip</b> <b>hazards</b> over 4 floors and 2000 m 2 in an active construction site, this approach was able to differentiate between identical objects in different physical configurations (see Figure 1). Outperforming a colour only detector, our multi-modal trip detector fuses colour and depth information to achieve a 4 % absolute improvement in F 1 -score. These investigative results and the extensive dataset which is now publicly available, moves us one step closer to assistive or fully automated safety inspection systems on construction sites...|$|R

5000|$|Overall {{the design}} {{was smaller than}} the M113, and {{considerably}} less [...] "boxy," [...] more in keeping with contemporary European designs like the FV432. The small size meant {{there was no room}} for a transverse transmission in the front of the vehicle, so a rear-drive was used with a drive shaft and transaxle housed under the cargo section. These required boxy protrusions into the cargo area, and the transaxle in particular, mounted just in front of the doors, was a major <b>tripping</b> <b>hazard.</b> Additionally, the drive shaft was extremely noisy in operation.|$|E

50|$|Cords: Electrical cords {{connecting}} a neon artwork to a {{power source}} should be checked {{on a regular}} basis for any signs of fraying or wear and tear. The placement of cords is also important. If cords are run in high traffic areas, they may pose a <b>tripping</b> <b>hazard</b> to visitors, which could potentially result in personal injury and damage to the cord and/or artwork. The placement of cords in and against walls and out of traffic areas provide better safety and use. Use of extension cords are not recommended, as they increase the risk of potential electrical and tripping hazards. Review of the artwork and its installation, including outlet and cord placement,by curatorial, installation, and electrical staff will help ensure the safety of the artwork.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} design dates from 1965 as a 12-seat (six rows with a centre aisle) aircraft. The aircraft was a low-wing, high-tail monoplane of conventional layout. Considerable attention {{was paid to}} streamlining in order to improve performance, which led to one of the design's more distinctive features, a long nose profile. The fuselage had a circular cross-section to ease pressurisation, allowing much-higher-altitude flights and consequent higher speed and comfort than competing unpressurised designs. One drawback of the design was that fuselage was so small in cross-section that the cabin floor had to be [...] "lowered" [...] to allow stand-up passenger entry and egress through the rear door. This meant that the main spar had to run through the cabin, causing a <b>tripping</b> <b>hazard.</b>|$|E

50|$|Hot water {{extraction}} equipment {{may be a}} portable unit that plugs into an electrical outlet, or a truck mount carpet cleaner requiring long hoses from the truck or trailer. Truck mounted equipment may be used where electricity is unavailable (e.g. if electrical service was terminated). Truck mount carpet cleaning may be unsuited to premises distant from a driveway or road, and hoses may need to pass through windows to reach upper floors of a building. Hoses needed for truck mount and professional portable carpet cleaning may present an inconvenience or <b>tripping</b> <b>hazard</b> to users of hallways, and pets or children can escape through doors that must be left ajar for hoses. Heated or air conditioned air will also escape from buildings when doors are left open for hoses, potentially creating a significant waste of energy. Truck mounted carpet cleaning equipment minimizes noise in the room being cleaned, but may cause noise and air pollution offensive to neighbors, and may violate anti-idling bylaws in some jurisdictions. However, truck-mounted cleaning is much faster than portable equipment, and the extra heat will dissolve more spots and stains, and more vacuum suction power will reduce drying times.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of software-intensive systems {{is driven by}} their requirements. Traditional requirements engineering (RE) methods focus on resolving ambiguities in requirements and advocate specifying require-ments in sufficient detail so that the implementation can be checked against them for conformance. In an ideal world, {{this way of thinking}} can be very effective. Requirements can be specified clearly, updated as necessary, and evolutions of the software design can be made with the requirements in mind. Increasingly, however, it is not sufficient to fix requirements statically because they will change at runtime as the operating environment changes. Furthermore, as software systems become more pervasive, there is growing uncertainty about the environment and so requirements changes cannot be predicted at design-time [12, 24, 39, 1, 20]. It is considerations such as these that have led to the {{development of}} self-adaptive systems (SASs) [11], which have the ability to dynamically and autonomously reconfigure their behavior to respond to changing external conditions. Consider a scenario involving a robot vacuum cleaner for domestic apartments. The vacuum cleaner has goals clean apartment, avoid <b>tripping</b> <b>hazard</b> and minimize energy costs. Further, it has the domain assumption energy is cheapest at night. To satisfy the avoid <b>tripping</b> <b>hazard</b> goal, a requirement is derived that it should stop operating as soon as any human activity is detected. Night operation satisfies th...|$|E
40|$|Pedestrian {{concrete}} pavements (sidewalks) are usually made of continuous slabs with simple control joints at a specified interval. Simple control joints such as breaking score lines or saw cuts are created on the pedestrian {{concrete pavements}} mainly to relieve stresses resulting from friction {{and also to}} avoid displacement/unplanned cracking. However, these joints have no load transfer mechanism and therefore the concrete slab panels may have different vertical movements at the joint when the pavements are affected by tree root invasion or by soil movement. Such differential vertical movements at adjoining slabs can create <b>tripping</b> <b>hazards</b> to pedestrians. This paper presents the use of ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer (EPDM) rubber and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) joiners for minimizing such <b>tripping</b> <b>hazards.</b> An experimental investigation for evaluating stepping displacements of concrete pavements connected by EPDM rubber and PVC joiners has been undertaken.

40|$|Janet Kupperman, FACSM, Rachel Mead, Shelby McNealy. Rockhurst University. Kansas City, Missouri Workplace falls {{result in}} {{significant}} medical and legal costs. Regardless of financial concern, Rockhurst’s established value of “CuraPersonalis,” {{care of the}} whole person, places high priority on the welfare of Rockhurst’s campus members. PURPOSE: The current investigation was undertaken to examine fall risk factors, the pattern of Rockhurst falls, and general and Rockhurst fall prevention strategies and to implement a fall prevention program consistent with findings. METHODS: A campus-wide safety audit was performed using a previously published checklist. The most common issue was electrical cords on floors that could pose a <b>tripping</b> <b>hazard.</b> Fall prevention initiatives on the Rockhurst campus mainly related to communication. Information about falls reported to Campus Security from September 2014 to July 2015 was categorized based on location and individuals involved. While the number and severity of reported falls did indicate that an exercise-based intervention program was warranted, an informational campaign was considered useful. Investigators staffed a table with brochures, a computer displaying an educational video, and a poster during the initial part of the all-employee university opening workshop. They engaged interested individuals in conversation about fall prevention and offered to provide <b>tripping</b> <b>hazard</b> signage. Copies of three different brochures were distributed and displayed in eight offices on campus, and the <b>tripping</b> <b>hazard</b> signs were made available. RESULTS: Few individuals took initiative to view materials at the opening workshop. Those who approached investigators engaged them in conversation about falls, often describing unreported falls. Investigators distributed brochures to each individual on entering the meeting room. With respect to brochures distributed to campus offices, after ten days, no brochures remained at four locations, and seven to nine brochures remained at four other locations. Repeating the audit at that time revealed many {{but not all of}} the same tripping hazards. CONCLUSION: The level of concern displayed by the administrator who initiated interest in the project was inconsistent with the data on reported falls. Since anecdotal evidence suggested that fall underreporting, especially falls that did not result in major injuries, may be prevalent, ongoing informational efforts may be both helpful and aligned with Rockhurst values...|$|E
