5|$|Henry's son, George Herbert, {{maintained}} the lease and his wife, Henrietta, constructed gravel-laid public {{walks around the}} castle, dug into the surrounding cliffs, and planted trees around the grounds to improve the castle's appearance. The castle walls and towers were given superficial repairs and <b>tidied</b> up, usually when parts threatened to collapse, and {{the interior of the}} inner bailey levelled, costing considerable sums of money. The landscape also required expensive maintenance and repairs.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 a {{party of}} French {{academics}} attended a condensed matter conference in Ukraine where physicist Daniel Beysens introduced them {{to the story of}} how ancient Theodosia was supplied with water from dew condensers. They were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went to see for themselves. They concluded that the mounds that Zibold identified as dew condensers were in fact ancient burial mounds (a part of the necropolis of antic Theodosia) and that the pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with the mounds. They found the remains of Zibold's condenser, which they <b>tidied</b> up and examined closely. Zibold's condenser had apparently performed reasonably well, but in fact his exact results are not at all clear, and {{it is possible that the}} collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to the yield. If Zibold's condenser worked at all, this was probably due to fact that a few stones near the surface of the mound were able to lose heat at night while being thermally isolated from the ground; however, it could never have produced the yield that Zibold envisaged.|$|E

25|$|Restorations {{were carried}} out by J.M.Derick in 1850 and William Butterfield in 1871. Derick {{replaced}} two-light windows with windows of three lights. Butterfield <b>tidied</b> some of the timbers in the tower. At that time, the existing entrance at the west end was also added.

25|$|Thwarted, the Council {{elected to}} seek rezoning. As Geoff Chamberlain, the City Librarian acknowledged, the {{original}} zoning {{on the site}} was historically complex, and never <b>tidied</b> up. In fact, it limited the coverage of any building to only 10% of the land; but the original building built in 1968 had covered 19.5%. This {{did not include the}} Plunket building. The new plan was initially thought to be 32.9%, then revised to 48%. This apparent expansion of the footprint particularly concerned resident Clyde Scott, who was later one of those who lodged an appeal with the Environment Court.|$|E

In fact in this act Nan/Zoe is now played by the actress who played the real Zoe in Act 1. However she still has the same humorous flaws, movements and habits. She has also been programmed to respond to certain trigger words using phrases and actions which Jerome anticipates will be useful – but comedy results from the unexpected use of the trigger words in normal conversation.|$|E
25|$|The Panorama Elite II range {{built on}} the success of the Panorama I and Panorama Elite. The front grill was squared up {{although}} it still used the same twin headlight layout. The first bay on the near side was <b>tidied</b> up so the top of the window was in line with all the other side windows. Parcel racks were redesigned so the supply of fresh air and light output was more readily available. The service units were now mounted front to back instead of side to side and were much slimmer to maximize on headroom when leaving the seats. Crash padding was provided along the inner side of the racks in the form of black PVC squares filled with padding. The dashboard was again improved as was the front cabinet. The rear of the vehicle still used the soup plates from the previous range.|$|E

He was also unsure about the ending, saying it <b>tidied</b> up the series' mysteries but required watching the movie to understand the story.

500|$|Breeding occurs from August to December. Like all currawongs, {{it builds}} a large cup-nest out of sticks, lined with softer material, {{and placed in}} the fork of a tree from [...] high. Old nests are {{sometimes}} <b>tidied</b> up and reused in following years. A typical clutch has two to four pale grey-brown, purplish-buff, spotted, blotched red-brown or purplish-brown eggs. [...] As in all passerines, the chicks are born naked, and blind (altricial), and remain in the nest for an extended period (nidicolous). Both parents feed the young, but the male feeds them alone after leaving the nest and as they become more independent, and also moves from giving food directly to them to placing it on the ground near them so they learn to eat for themselves.|$|E
500|$|Despite his reservations, in October 2011 Virtanen {{cooperated with}} another scholar, Vesa Sirén, to prepare {{three of the}} more {{developed}} fragments for performance. The sketches were copied and <b>tidied,</b> but nothing not written by Sibelius {{was added to the}} material. Permission from the Sibelius Rights Holders was secured, and John Storgårds, chief conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic, agreed to play and record these excerpts at the orchestra's rehearsal session on 30 October 2011. The pieces comprise an opening segment of about a minute's duration, an eight-second fragment that might be part of a scherzo, and a final scrap of orchestral music again lasting roughly a minute. Sirén describes the music as [...] "strange, powerful, and with daring, spicy harmonies—a step into the new even after Tapiola and the music for The Tempest". Stearns gives a more detailed insight: [...] "The first excerpt is classic Sibelian announcement of a first movement. There's a genteel orchestral thunderclap that throws open the door to a harmonic world that is Sibelius' alone, but has strange dissonances unlike any other work. Another glimpse sounds like the beginning of a scherzo, surprisingly spring-like with a buoyant flute solo. Another snippet has a classic Sibelian bassoon solo, the sort that speaks of primal things and goes to a dark, wintry underworld." ...|$|E
500|$|Industry {{was slow}} to take hold, and by {{the second half of}} the 18th century, Cogglesford Mill was the only working corn mill in the town. An old mill at the {{junction}} of Westgate and Castle Causeway supplied hemp to the growing rope-making business of the Foster and Hill families. As local historian Simon Pawley wrote, [...] "in many respects, things had changed little [...] since the survey of 1692", with few of the buildings or infrastructure being improved. Major changes to agriculture and industry took place in the last decade of that century. From the Middle Ages, Sleaford was surrounded by three open fields: North, West and Sleaford Fields. At the enclosure of the open fields in 1794 more than 90% of the 1,096acres of open land was owned by Lord Bristol. Despite the costs of fencing and re-organising the fields, the system was easier to farm, and cottages were built closer to fields, while the landowner could charge more rent owing to the increased profitability of the land; those who lost out were the cottagers, who could no longer keep a few animals grazing on the common land at no cost. The process allowed the land boundaries and pathways to be <b>tidied</b> up; Drove Lane, which ran to Rauceby, was shifted north and straightened.|$|E

500|$|Part 1 {{begins as}} the group heads off to Ross's wedding in London leaving behind a heavily {{pregnant}} Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), who has declined the invitation. In London, Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Chandler (Matthew Perry) go see the sights in a musical montage featuring The Clash's song [...] "London Calling", with Joey filming everything on his camcorder. Chandler becomes embarrassed by his friend's enthusiasm, and after Joey buys a large Union Flag hat from a vendor (played by guest star Richard Branson), they part company. They reunite in their hotel room and Chandler apologizes. Joey impresses him with a video recording of Sarah, Duchess of York (who played herself). Emily takes Ross to the hall where the wedding will be, but they discover it is being demolished earlier than originally scheduled. Monica later suggests Emily postpone the wedding until everything is perfect. She passes the thought on to Ross, angering him; he tells her people have flown from America {{to be there and}} that it is [...] "now or never"; she chooses [...] "never". Monica berates Ross for his insensitivity and Ross apologizes to Emily, showing her the ceremony can still take place in the half-demolished hall that he has <b>tidied</b> up. She agrees. In New York, Rachel realizes she still loves Ross, and flies to London to tell him.|$|E
500|$|While {{the film}} was praised for its {{fidelity}} to the novel, this aspect was also singled out as the main factor in contributing to the lengthy running time. John C. Flinn wrote for Variety that Selznick had [...] "left too much in", and that as entertainment, the film would have benefited if repetitious scenes and dialog from {{the latter part of}} the story had been trimmed. The Manchester Guardian felt that the film's one serious drawback was that the story lacked the epic quality to justify the outlay of time and found the second half, which focuses on Scarlett's [...] "irrelevant marriages" [...] and [...] "domestic squabbles," [...] mostly superfluous, and the sole reason for their inclusion had been [...] "simply because Margaret Mitchell wrote it that way". The Guardian believed that if [...] "the story had been cut short and <b>tidied</b> up at the point marked by the interval, and if the personal drama had been made subservient to a cinematic treatment of the central theme—the collapse and devastation of the Old South—then Gone With the Wind might have been a really great film." [...] Likewise, Hoellering also found the second half of the film to be weaker than the first half: identifying the Civil War to be the driving force of the first part while the characters dominate in the second part, he concluded this is where the main fault of the picture lay, commenting that [...] "the characters alone do not suffice". Despite many excellent scenes, he considered the drama to be unconvincing and that the [...] "psychological development" [...] had been neglected.|$|E
500|$|After the {{expedition}} McNish {{returned to the}} Merchant Navy, working on various ships. He often complained that his bones permanently ached due to the conditions during the journey in the James Caird; he would reportedly sometimes refuse to shake hands because of the pain. He divorced Lizzie Littlejohn on 2 March 1918, by which time he had already met his new partner, Agnes Martindale. McNish had a son named Tom and Martindale had a daughter named Nancy. [...] Although she is mentioned frequently in his diary, it appears McNish was not Nancy's father. He spent 23 years in the Navy in total during his life, but eventually secured {{a job with the}} New Zealand Shipping Company. After making five trips to New Zealand he moved there in 1925, leaving behind his wife and all of his carpentry tools. He worked on the waterfront in Wellington until his career was ended by an injury. Destitute, he would sleep in the wharf sheds under a tarpaulin and relied on monthly collections from the dockworkers. He was found a place in the Ohiro Benevolent Home, but his health continued to deteriorate and he died on 24 September 1930 in Wellington Hospital. He was buried in Karori Cemetery, Wellington, on 26 September 1930, with full naval honours; HMS Dunedin (which happened to be in port at the time) provided twelve men for the firing party and eight bearers. [...] However, his grave remained unmarked for almost thirty years; the New Zealand Antarctic Society (NZAC) erected a headstone on 10 May 1959. In 2001, it was reported that the grave was untended and surrounded by weeds, but in 2004, the grave was <b>tidied</b> and a life size bronze sculpture of McNish's beloved cat, Mrs. Chippy, was placed on his grave by NZAC. His grandson, Tom, believes this tribute would have meant more to him than receiving the Polar Medal.|$|E
