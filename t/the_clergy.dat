They are a minority in Opus Dei—only about 2% of Opus Dei members are part of <b>the</b> <b>clergy.</b> Typically, they are numeraries or associates who ultimately joined the priesthood.|$|E

5|$|Bormann {{was one of}} {{the leading}} proponents of the ongoing {{persecution}} of the Christian churches. In February 1937 he decreed that members of <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> should not be admitted to the NSDAP. The following year he ruled that any members of <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> who were holding party offices should be dismissed, and that any party member who was considering entering <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> had to give up his party membership. While Bormann's push to force the closure of theological departments at Reich universities was unsuccessful, he was able {{to reduce the amount of}} religious instruction provided in public schools to two hours per week and mandated the removal of crucifixes from classrooms. Speer notes in his memoirs that while drafting plans for Welthauptstadt Germania, the planned rebuilding of Berlin, he was told by Bormann that churches were not to be allocated any building sites.|$|E
50|$|He {{showed the}} same {{concerns}} about Swedish domestic politics. During his regency, {{the law of}} Uppland was established. He acted as Birger Jarl had done in the conflict against the church, in order to abolish <b>the</b> <b>clergy's</b> tax exemption. <b>The</b> <b>clergy's</b> discontent became apparent in 1303.|$|R

5|$|Ecgbert {{wrote the}} Dialogus ecclesiasticae institutionis, {{which was a}} legal code for <b>the</b> <b>clergy,</b> setting forth the proper {{procedures}} for many clerical and ecclesiastical issues including weregild for clerics, entrance to clerical orders, deposition from <b>the</b> <b>clergy,</b> criminal monks, clerics in court, and other matters. It survives as one complete manuscript, with a few excerpts in other manuscripts. Because Ecgbert was the senior archbishop in England {{after the death of}} Nothhelm in 739, {{it is possible that the}} Dialogus was intended not just for the Northumbrian church but for the entire church in England. The Dialogus details a code of conduct for <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> and how <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> was to behave in society. The exact date it was composed is unclear, but it was probably after 735, based on the mention of the archiepiscopal status of Ecgbert in one title as well as the internal evidence of the work. The historian Simon Coates saw the Dialogus as not especially exalting monks above the laity.|$|E
5|$|Espejo {{realized}} that the charges against <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> were so serious {{that he had to}} focus on destroying Barreto's credibility. Therefore, he implied that Barreto's own conduct was outrageous because of his excesses in collecting taxes and his habit of paying public funds to licentious women. Additionally, he stated that the real author of the report was José Miguel Vallejo, whom he called an immoral man who despised <b>the</b> <b>clergy.</b> Thus, Espejo claimed the report should not be believed.|$|E
5|$|Peckham {{was very}} strict in his interpretations of canon law, and once wrote to Queen Eleanor that {{her use of}} loans from Jewish moneylenders to acquire lands was usury and a mortal sin. He also felt that Welsh laws were illogical and {{conflicted}} with Biblical teachings. He also mandated that the clerical tonsure worn by <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> should not just include {{the top of the}} head, but also have the nape and over the ears shaved, which allowed <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> to be easily distinguished from the laity. To help with this, the archbishop also forbade <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> from wearing secular clothing, especially military garb. He also forbade an effort by the Benedictine order in England to reform their monastic rule, to allow more time for study and for more education for the monks. Peckham's reason was that they were against custom, but he may also have had concerns that these reforms would have drawn recruits away from the Franciscans.|$|E
50|$|Fish’s {{pamphlet}} {{rejects the}} sale of indulgences. He argues that the supposed act of penance was merely a ruse to fill <b>the</b> <b>clergy's</b> coffers.|$|R
2500|$|Reflecting <b>the</b> <b>clergy's</b> role as {{community}} leaders and organizers, family life usually centered not on religion but on {{political and social}} questions. According to the memoirs of one priest's son, his own family and that of other priests were [...] "honorable" [...] but much more concerned about national than religious issues. [...] Conversations centered on economic concerns, village affairs, and politics while in his and other priestly families moral or religious matters were not discussed. Despite the role of <b>the</b> Ukrainian <b>clergy</b> within <b>the</b> Ukrainian national revival, <b>the</b> <b>clergy's</b> educational and social status resulted in the Polish language being the language of daily use by most clerical families {{until the end of}} the 19th century.|$|R

5|$|The 1224 carucage was a tax levied only on <b>the</b> <b>clergy,</b> and the {{revenues}} from {{it did not}} appear in that year's Pipe Roll. It is likely that <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> who owed the carucage also collected the tax. Records indicate {{that the bulk of}} the money raised was paid into the Wardrobe, the king's personal treasury, rather than the Exchequer. The 1224 assessment was based on ploughteams, and was imposed to pay for the restitution of the lost lands in France.|$|E
5|$|Winchelsey was a fearless {{opponent}} of Edward I. When he swore his oath of fealty to Edward, he offended the king {{by adding a}} declaration {{that he was only}} swearing fealty for the temporalities, not the spiritualities. All through his term as archbishop he refused to allow Edward to tax <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> beyond certain levels, and withstood severe pressure to change his mind. In August 1295, he offered the king a tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues, less than Edward had hoped to collect from <b>the</b> <b>clergy.</b> Winchelsey did concede though that if the war with France, which was what the money was requested to fund, continued into the following year, then <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> would be amenable to making further contributions.|$|E

5|$|All clergy, whether deacons, priests or bishops, may preach, teach, baptise, witness {{marriages and}} conduct funeral liturgies. Only bishops and priests can {{administer}} the sacraments of the Eucharist, Reconciliation (Penance) and Anointing of the Sick. Only bishops can administer {{the sacrament of}} Holy Orders, which ordains someone into <b>the</b> <b>clergy.</b>|$|E

5|$|During his pontificate Innocent XII {{worked to}} improve {{relations}} with Louis XIV of France. He reached a compromise with the French king by agreeing to the confirmation of all bishops that Louis had created since 1682 {{in return for the}} king's promise not to make them abide by the Declaration of <b>the</b> <b>Clergy</b> of France.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> poorer <b>clergy,</b> {{rural and}} urban {{itinerant}} preachers who were not well positioned in the church, {{were more likely to}} join the Reformation. Some of <b>the</b> poorer <b>clergy</b> sought to extend Luther's equalizing ideas to society at large.|$|R
5|$|During the 12th and 13th centuries, law {{was taught}} in the City of London, {{primarily}} by <b>the</b> <b>clergy.</b> During the 13th century, two events happened that destroyed this form of legal education; firstly, a decree by Henry III of England on 2 December 1234 that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London, and secondly a papal bull was issued in 1254 that prohibited <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> from teaching the common law, rather than canon law. As a result, the existing system of legal education fell apart. The common lawyers migrated to the hamlet of Holborn, the nearest place to the law courts at Westminster Hall that was outside the City.|$|E
5|$|During the 1730s and 1740s, the Presbyterian Church {{was divided}} over {{the impact of}} the First Great Awakening. Drawing from the Scotch-Irish revivalist tradition, evangelical ministers such as William and Gilbert Tennent {{emphasized}} the necessity of a conscious conversion experience and the need for higher moral standards among <b>the</b> <b>clergy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gregory legislated on the {{behaviour}} of {{the laity}} and <b>the</b> <b>clergy.</b> He placed the new mission directly under papal authority {{and made it}} clear that English bishops would have no authority over Frankish counterparts nor vice versa. Other directives dealt with the training of native clergy and the missionaries' conduct.|$|E
50|$|Although Scrope's {{participation}} in the Percy rebellion of 1405 is usually attributed to {{his opposition to the}} King's proposal to temporarily confiscate <b>the</b> <b>clergy's</b> landed wealth, his motive for taking an active military role in the rising continues to puzzle historians.|$|R
50|$|However, in 1754, {{due to the}} Bourbon Reforms {{implemented}} by the Spanish kings, the Mercedarins -and the rest of <b>the</b> regular <b>clergy</b> for that matter-, had to transfer their doctrines to <b>the</b> secular <b>clergy,</b> thus losing their San Juan Ostuncalco doctrine.|$|R

5|$|Henry's {{relationship}} with the Church varied considerably across his lands and over time: as with other aspects of his rule, there was no attempt to form a common ecclesiastical policy. Insofar as Henry had a policy it was to generally push back on papal influence, increasing his own local authority. The 12th century saw a reforming movement within the Church, however, advocating greater autonomy from royal authority for <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> and more influence for the papacy. This trend had already caused tensions in England, for example when King Stephen forced Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, into exile in 1152. There were also long-running concerns over the legal treatment of members of <b>the</b> <b>clergy.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1532, Thomas Cromwell {{brought before}} Parliament {{a number of}} acts {{including}} the Supplication against the Ordinaries and Submission of <b>the</b> <b>Clergy,</b> which recognised royal supremacy over the church, thus finalising the break with Rome. Following these acts, Thomas More resigned as Chancellor, leaving Cromwell as Henry's chief minister.|$|E
