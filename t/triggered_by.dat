5|$|About 6% {{of those}} with {{epilepsy}} have seizures that are often <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> specific events and are known as reflex seizures. Those with reflex epilepsy have seizures that are only <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> specific stimuli. Common triggers include flashing lights and sudden noises. In certain types of epilepsy, seizures happen more often during sleep, and in other types they occur almost only when sleeping.|$|E

5|$|Guttate {{psoriasis}} {{is characterized}} by numerous small, scaly, red or pink, droplet-like lesions (papules).

5|$|In a small {{proportion}} of cases, the encephalopathy is caused directly by liver failure; this is more likely in acute liver failure. More commonly, especially in chronic liver disease, hepatic encephalopathy is <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> an additional cause, and identifying these triggers can be important to treat the episode effectively.|$|E
5|$|Lower demand <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> the 1997–1998 Asian {{financial}} crisis saw {{the price of}} oil fall back to 1986 levels. After oil slumped to around US$10/bbl, joint diplomacy achieved a gradual slowing of oil production by OPEC, Mexico and Norway.|$|E

30|$|The {{physical}} {{mechanisms that}} operate to trigger earthquakes remotely {{are still under}} debate. Nevertheless, two main classes of models (Hill and Prejean 2015) are used to explain the <b>triggering</b> <b>by</b> dynamic stresses: (1) direct <b>triggering</b> <b>by</b> frictional failure and (2) triggering through excitation of crustal fluids. As documented in previous studies (e.g., Aiken and Peng 2014), fluids are active agents in geothermal and volcanic areas, where dynamic triggering is often observed.|$|R
5|$|Not all {{volcanism}} in Chile {{is relative}} to subduction of the Nazca Plate; the Chile Ridge exhibits submarine volcanism, and volcanism in the Austral Volcanic Zone is <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> the Antarctic Plate subducting beneath the South American Plate.

5|$|Pulpitis (inflammation of the pulp) can be <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> various stimuli (insults), {{including}} mechanical, thermal, chemical, and bacterial irritants, or rarely barometric {{changes and}} ionizing radiation. Common causes include tooth decay, dental trauma (such as a crack or fracture), or a filling with an imperfect seal.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause is}} not {{completely}} understood, but involves a T cell-mediated immune response <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> a variety of factors.

5|$|The upper esophageal {{sphincter}} {{surrounds the}} upper part of the esophagus. It consists of skeletal muscle but is not under voluntary control. Opening of the upper esophageal sphincter is <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> the swallowing reflex. The primary muscle of the upper esophageal sphincter is the cricopharyngeal part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor.|$|E

5|$|A {{by-election}} {{need not}} be held to fill a vacancy in any GRC <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> the death or resignation of an MP, {{even if there are}} no other minority candidates in that GRC, or any other reason. A by-election is required only if all the MPs in a GRC vacate their Parliamentary seats. Assuming that such a situation does arise, the Prime Minister would be obliged to call a by-election within a reasonable time, unless he intends to call a general election in the near future.|$|E
5|$|A {{pattern of}} lake cycles {{becoming}} {{longer than the}} preceding one has been noted. Water from the lake {{may have contributed to}} increased oxygen-18 at Sajama around 14,300 years ago, possibly <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> evaporation. As the lake level dropped, Lake Poopó would have been disconnected first; the sill separating it from the rest of Lake Tauca is relatively shallow. Coipasa and Uyuni would have remained connected until later. Water levels in Lake Titicaca's Lake Huinaimarca were low by 14,200 BP.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{remained}} far from land, the waves <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> Liza {{were able to}} reach California, where they combined with high tide, threatening beachfront homes that had weakened foundations after a previous tide. The hurricane was responsible for sweeping hundreds of Labor Day swimmers out into the ocean in Zuma Beach and Newport Beach, {{all of whom were}} saved by lifeguards. The waves also tore off a group of sundecks estimated at $5,000(1968USD) near Laguna Beach.|$|E
40|$|The onset {{conditions}} for the m/n= 2 / 1 neoclassical tearing mode (NTM) are studied in terms of neoclassical drive, triggering instabilities, and toroidal rotation or rotation shear, in the spherical torus NSTX [M. Ono, et al., Nuclear Fusion 40, 557 (2000) ]. There are three typical onset {{conditions for}} these modes, given in order of increasing neoclassical drive required for mode onset: <b>triggering</b> <b>by</b> energetic particle modes, <b>triggering</b> <b>by</b> edge localized modes, and cases where the modes appear to grow without a trigger. In all cases, the required drive increases with toroidal rotation shear, implying a stabilizing effect from the shear...|$|R

5|$|Altitudinal {{migration}} {{is a form}} of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.|$|E
5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100billion atomic bombs. This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field was weakening, which could precede a reversal of the north and south magnetic poles, and the arrival of the next solar maximum, which was expected sometime around 2012.|$|E
5|$|Because {{ovulation}} is {{not always}} <b>triggered</b> <b>by</b> a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate. Furthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may mate {{with more than one}} male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathers.|$|E
30|$|In[19], {{the authors}} {{proposed}} enhancing handover <b>triggering</b> <b>by</b> means of positioning {{information and the}} deployment of relay stations (RSs) with power control. These RSs are installed {{in the middle of}} overlapping regions. The main drawback of this proposal is the investment cost due to deployment of RSs.|$|R
