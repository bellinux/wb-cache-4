Alperson from Grand National Films, a newly established, {{independent}} studio, approached him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>movies</b> for $100,000 a film and 10% of the profits.

500|$|... ere we have John Wayne, {{who was a}} major {{artistic and}} {{psychological}} figure on the American scene, ... who at one point used <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>movies</b> of soldiers who had a certain validity, ... {{a certain sense of}} honor [...] what the soldier was doing.... Even if it was a cavalry movie doing a historically dishonorable thing to the Indians, even as there was a feeling of {{what it meant to be}} a man, what it meant to have some sense of duty.... Now today we have the same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, I'm sure it is perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of how the whole country has deteriorated. And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets. Because that would make a very striking comment on what has happened to America in general.|$|E
