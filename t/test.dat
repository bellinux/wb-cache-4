5|$|As {{the series}} 2–1 in Australia's favour {{and not yet}} won, the Fifth <b>Test</b> in Melbourne was a {{timeless}} <b>Test.</b> Harvey compiled his third consecutive century and highest <b>Test</b> score of 205 as Australia amassed 520 in the first innings.

5|$|Chappell {{played his}} first <b>Test</b> match in December 1970, {{and became the}} tenth Australian to score a century on <b>Test</b> debut, accumulating 108 runs against England in the second <b>Test</b> of the 1970–71 Ashes series. In 1974, he scored centuries in both innings of a match against New Zealand; his brother, Ian also {{achieved}} the feat in the match. In the first innings against New Zealand, Chappell recorded his highest score in <b>Test</b> cricket, 247 not out. He scored two centuries in a <b>Test</b> again late the following year against the West Indies, during his first match as captain of Australia. He scored three further double centuries in <b>Test</b> matches, two against Pakistan, and one against India, all in 1980 or 1981. During the fifth <b>Test</b> of the 1983–84 series against Pakistan, Chappell {{announced that he would}} retire {{at the end of the}} match; during the fourth day he scored his final century in international cricket. In doing so, Chappell became one of only four players to score centuries in both their first and last <b>Test</b> match.|$|E
5|$|De Silva {{debuted in}} 1984 and scored his first <b>Test</b> century in October 1985 against Pakistan. In a man-of-the-match performance, he scored122 in an eight-and-a-half-hours innings. He made centuries in both innings of a match when he scored 138and 103– not out in both innings – {{in the second}} <b>Test</b> of the 1997 series against Pakistan, and , {{he is the only}} player to score not out centuries in both innings of a <b>Test.</b> He {{repeated}} the feat of scoring centuries in both innings in the same year, when he scored 146and 120against India in another man-of-the-match performance. De Silva's highest <b>Test</b> score of 267, achieved in January 1991 in Wellington, was reached in 380balls against New Zealand. The performance is the sixth-highest score by a Sri Lankan batsman in <b>Test</b> cricket.

5|$|Despite {{his failure}} to reach double figures at The Oval, Craig {{maintained}} his position in the playing XI on the tour of the Indian subcontinent en route to Australia in late 1956, playing <b>Test</b> matches against Pakistan and India. However, he failed to pass 40 in his five innings. He made a duck and 18 on a matting wicket in Australia's one-off <b>Test</b> against Pakistan in Karachi before playing in the First <b>Test</b> against India, scoring 40 in an innings win in Madras. He was dropped for the Second <b>Test</b> but returned to make 36 and 6 in the Third <b>Test</b> in Calcutta as Australia took a 2–0 series win. The matches were {{the first time that}} Australia had played a <b>Test</b> in Asia.|$|E
5000|$|Methods of weld <b>testing</b> and {{analysis}} {{are used to}} assure the quality and correctness of the weld after it is completed. This term generally refers to <b>testing</b> {{and analysis}} focused on the quality and strength of the weld, but may refer to technological actions to check for the presence, position and extent of welds. These are divided into destructive and non-destructive methods. A few examples of destructive <b>testing</b> include macro etch <b>testing,</b> fillet-weld break <b>tests,</b> transverse tension <b>tests,</b> and guided bend <b>tests.</b> Other destructive methods include acid etch <b>testing,</b> back bend <b>testing,</b> tensile strength break <b>testing,</b> nick break <b>testing,</b> and free bend <b>testing.</b> Non-destructive methods include fluorescent penetrate <b>tests,</b> magnaflux <b>tests,</b> eddy current (electromagnetic) <b>tests,</b> hydrostatic <b>testing,</b> <b>tests</b> using magnetic particles, X-rays and gamma ray based methods and acoustic emission techniques.

5|$|Dhoni {{returned}} to the team as captain for the second match at Brisbane where Kohli scored 19 and 1 in a four-wicket defeat for India. In the Melbourne Boxing Day <b>Test,</b> Kohli was India's top-scorer in both innings. He made his personal best <b>Test</b> score of 169 in the first innings while sharing a 262-run partnership with Rahane, India's biggest partnership outside Asia in ten years. Kohli followed it with a score of 54 in India's second innings on the fifth day, helping his team draw the <b>Test</b> match. Dhoni announced his retirement from <b>Test</b> cricket {{at the conclusion of}} this match, and Kohli was appointed as the full-time <b>Test</b> captain ahead of the fourth <b>Test</b> at Sydney. Captaining the <b>Test</b> team for the second time, Kohli hit 147 in the first innings of the match and became the first batsman in <b>Test</b> cricket history to score three hundreds in his first three innings as <b>Test</b> captain. He was dismissed for 46 in the second innings and India hung in for another draw. Kohli's total of 692 runs in four Tests was the most by any Indian batsman in a <b>Test</b> series in Australia.|$|E

5|$|For testing purposes, a {{new engine}} {{consisting}} of six Armstrong Siddeley Viper jet engines blowing across the outer rim of an impeller was designed {{under the name}} PV-704, PV stood for Private Venture. The PV-704 was a stop-gap design built into a bunker-like building behind the Avro Experimental <b>Test</b> facility. It was intended to <b>test</b> various Project 1794 concepts and provide the USAF with <b>test</b> data to show {{the viability of the}} concept. The original plan to initially <b>test</b> the Viper Engine Rig was to have continued into free flight testing. Unfortunately, testing was anything but smooth; the <b>test</b> model suffered from hazardous oil leaks, resulting in three fires. It eventually got to the point that staff were afraid of the machine, even when safely ensconced in a booth constructed of bullet-proof glass and quarter-inch-thick steel.
