50|$|Rounding {{is applied}} to the total of a bill, not to the line items on the bill. Typically, the total is rounded to the nearest {{multiple}} of the smallest denomination, which may be higher or lower than the unrounded total. Where the unrounded total is an equal distance from two multiples, practice varies: merchants may be required or encouraged <b>to</b> <b>round</b> <b>down</b> rather than up, giving the benefit to the buyer. An equal distance is possible when the rounding interval is an even number.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For {{the class}} of nonnegative random {{variables}} with given mean, variance, and skewness and support bound, we present a sharp upper bound for the expectation of <b>rounding</b> due <b>to</b> the Jeffer-son rule. The result gives an estimate for average extra gains due <b>to</b> <b>rounding</b> <b>down</b> payments. Arguments of four-dimensional geometric moment theory implemented in the proof provide tools for refined evaluations of rates of convergence of probability distributions and positive linear operators...|$|R

50|$|However, {{arithmetic}} right shifts {{are major}} traps for the unwary, specifically in treating rounding of negative integers. For example, {{in the usual}} two's complement representation of negative integers, −1 is represented as all 1's. For an 8-bit signed integer this is 1111 1111. An arithmetic right-shift by 1 (or 2, 3, …, 7) yields 1111 1111 again, which is still −1. This corresponds <b>to</b> <b>rounding</b> <b>down</b> (towards negative infinity), but is not the usual convention for division.|$|R
50|$|On 9 September 1988 {{she became}} the first woman to ever throw the javelin further than 80 metres. Strictly speaking, this world record throw was {{measured}} at 80.00m exactly. However, the rules in force at the time dictated that measurements had <b>to</b> be <b>rounded</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the nearest 2 cm, so it is almost certain that the throw was indeed further than 80 metres.|$|R
5000|$|The 1841 census {{recorded}} people's names, age, sex, occupation, and if {{they were}} born [...] "in county". Children under 15 were to have their age recorded accurately, while those over 15 were <b>to</b> be <b>rounded</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the nearest 5 years so, for example, someone aged 63 should be recorded as aged 60. However, not all enumerators followed this instruction and exact ages may have been recorded.|$|R

50|$|Many {{airlines}} {{request that}} fuel quantities be <b>rounded</b> <b>to</b> {{a multiple of}} 10 or 100 units. This can cause some interesting rounding problems, especially when subtotals are involved.

2500|$|Accurate {{rounding}} of transcendental mathematical functions {{is difficult}} {{because the number of}} extra digits that need to be calculated to resolve whether <b>to</b> <b>round</b> up or <b>down</b> cannot be known in advance.

50|$|The 1993 NFL {{draft was}} held April 25-26, 1993. The draft was reduced <b>to</b> eight <b>rounds,</b> <b>down</b> from 12. Because the Eagles tied with five other teams at 11-5 in 1992, they rotated in picking 20th to 25th {{in the eight}} rounds. There were 224 players taken in this draft by the NFL. The Eagles had two first round picks at number 19 and 24 overall. With those, they chose Lester Holmes, an {{offensive}} tackle out of Jackson State, and Leonard Renfro, a defensive tackle out of Colorado.|$|R
50|$|This {{leads to}} the dither solution. Rather than predictably <b>rounding</b> up or <b>down</b> in a repeating pattern, it is {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>round</b> up or <b>down</b> in a random pattern. Dithering {{is a way to}} randomly toggle the results between 4 and 5 so that 80% of the time it ended up on 5 then it would average 4.8 over the long run but would have random, non-repeating error in the result.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, other {{improvements}} were made—as well as simplifications required {{so most of}} the structure could be assembled with rivets. The cutaway hard chine that had been dropped in the American version of the Mark 2 vessels was restored. The tank deck, which was above the waterline, was made parallel to the keel, there was <b>to</b> be no <b>round</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the upper deck, and the ship was enlarged to accommodate the more bulky machinery.|$|R
50|$|In January 2000, Hockey {{had done}} an {{interview}} with the John Laws program about the GST, confirming the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)'s position of businesses being able <b>to</b> <b>round</b> up or <b>down</b> the price of goods and services when needed. This caused controversy, and The Daily Telegraph printed a story that declared that voters could be charged more than the 10% GST promised.|$|R
60|$|Well, by {{eleven o'clock}} he had cleared out a good deal--really, {{a very great}} deal--and many women had bought what they didn't want, at their own figure. Feverish but content, James shut the shop for the last time. Next day, by eleven, he had removed all his belongings, the door that {{connected}} {{the house with the}} shop was screwed up fast, the grocer strolled in and looked round his bare extension, took the key from James, and immediately set his boy to paste a new notice in the window, tearing down all James's announcements. Poor James had <b>to</b> run <b>round,</b> <b>down</b> Knarborough Road, and down Wellington Street as far as the Livery Stable, then down long narrow passages, before he could get into his own house, from his own shop.|$|R

30|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, LP problem (solvable in polynomial time) {{has less}} complexity compared to ILP problem (NP-hard optimization problem). In the CG solution of our optimization problem, RMP has been formulated as a LP and pricing problems as ILP type. As a result, {{we need to}} determine the optimal ILP solution of the RMP after {{the solution of the}} relaxed LP. Typically, this is done through the branch and bound algorithm [18], which is time consuming, as a result, we propose a heuristic method that satisfies the scheduling time constraint [28, 29]. The proposed method will <b>round</b> up and <b>down</b> the values of the scheduling variables, m_ℓ, e^j_t, of the LP solution [30, 31]. This operation will be carried out after m_ℓ, e^j_t have been sorted according to their priorities. m_ℓ, e^j_ts more likely <b>to</b> be <b>rounded</b> <b>down</b> will be given higher priority. Following this operation, it is possible that all the servers of a rack will become inactive in which case TOR switch serving to that rack will be turned off to save power.|$|R

50|$|A famous sniper {{during the}} war, used a sniper {{variant of the}} Swashbuckler. He sent his sick brother to a {{military}} hospital for treatment, and it is implied that Krayz used him as a hostage to get Lars to betray Mills. His brother died anyway, and Lars quit the army {{to live in the}} mountains, swearing never to kill again. He later decided to temporary withdraw his promise to help Mills reach the Regium Third Army, but he died in a sniping operation against a Dragnovian turret that was preventing Mills from crossing the mountains, managing <b>to</b> fire a <b>round</b> <b>down</b> the barrel of the turret, but taking a direct hit from the gun in the process.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} other {{possible}} rules for tie breaking when rounding a half integer include <b>rounding</b> up, <b>rounding</b> <b>down,</b> <b>rounding</b> <b>to</b> or away from zero, or random <b>rounding</b> up or <b>down.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Round</b> half <b>to</b> even, which <b>rounds</b> <b>to</b> {{the nearest}} even number, <b>rounds</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 1.2 in this case. The same {{strategy}} applied to 1.35 would instead <b>round</b> up <b>to</b> 1.4.|$|R
5000|$|... 2. Measurement sets: For each {{circumference}} site, a {{total of}} three measurements are taken. A method is provided <b>to</b> <b>round</b> measurements <b>to</b> the nearest half-inch.

50|$|He flew a Sopwith Pup {{for some}} time in 3 Squadron, Royal Naval Air Service before he {{achieved}} his first success on 6 April 1917. A Halberstadt D.II dived on him with a frontal attack; Fall half-looped onto the German plane's tail and fired 50 <b>rounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>down</b> him. Fall would score 10 more victories before changing planes to the Sopwith Camel. The 11 victories with the Sopwith Pup made Jo Fall the highest scoring Pup Ace. He would score 2 more shoot-downs with 3 RNAS, using the Camel.|$|R
50|$|The Karabiner Model 1931 feeds from a {{detachable}} box magazine machined {{to match}} the cartridge for which the rifle was being chambered, that can hold up to 6 rifle cartridges. The magazine release button {{is an integral part}} of the magazine.For reloading the K31 box magazine was normally not exchanged for another magazine but a unique formed phenolic resin embedded paper stripper clip with a tinned metal edge holding six rounds was used. Whereas most chargers or stripper clips only held the rounds at the end of the cartridge cases, the K31 charger nearly covers the entire cartridge. The charger has a guide slot wide enough for a gloved thumb <b>to</b> force <b>rounds</b> <b>down</b> and into the magazine in one smooth motion. The chargers or stripper clips have to be manually removed before the bolt can be closed.When the last cartridge from the magazine is fired, the follower comes up automatically during cycling locking the bolt open and preventing it from closing reminding the user the K31 needs to be reloaded.|$|R
50|$|In practice, {{instead of}} <b>rounding</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the nearest integer, {{it is better}} <b>to</b> use {{exponential}} <b>rounding</b> - <b>rounding</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the nearest power of some constant. In the case of digital goods, using this consensus-estimate allows us to attain at least 1/3.39 of the optimal profit, even in worst-case scenarios.|$|R

25|$|Fractional {{frequencies}} {{are normally}} <b>rounded</b> <b>down,</b> but <b>rounding</b> up <b>to</b> 667 is common {{because of the}} exact number being 666⅔ and <b>rounding</b> <b>to</b> the nearest whole number.

50|$|Mechanically, 4th edition saw a major {{overhaul}} of the game’s systems. Changes in spells and other per-encounter resourcing, giving all classes a similar number of at-will, per-encounter and per-day powers. Powers have {{a wide range of}} effects including inflicting status effects, creating zones, and forced movement, making combat very tactical for all classes but essentially requiring use of miniatures, reinforced by the use of squares to express distances. Attack rolls, skill checks and defense values all get a bonus equal <b>to</b> one-half level, <b>rounded</b> <b>down,</b> rather than increasing at different rates depending on class or skill point investment. Each skill is either trained (providing a fixed bonus on skill checks, and sometimes allowing more exotic uses for the skills) or untrained, but in either case all characters also receive a bonus to all skill rolls based on level. A system of “healing surges” and short and long rests are introduced to act as resource management.|$|R
