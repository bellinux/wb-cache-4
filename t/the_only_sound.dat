5|$|Bamber {{arrived at}} the {{farmhouse}} one or two minutes after the police. They waited for a tactical firearms group to arrive, which turned up at 5am and decided to wait until daylight before trying to enter. Police determined that all {{the doors and windows}} to the house were shut, except for the window in the main bedroom on the first floor. Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> they reported from the house was a dog barking.|$|E
5|$|Parsifal was {{expressly}} composed for {{the stage}} at Bayreuth {{and many of the}} most famous recordings of the opera come from live performances on that stage. In the pre-LP era, Karl Muck conducted excerpts from the opera at Bayreuth. These are still considered some of the best performances of the opera on disc. They also contain <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> evidence of the bells constructed for the work's premiere, which were melted down for scrap during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the failure}} of Adlertag and {{considerable}} loss rates on 15, 16 and 17 August, Kesselring convinced Göring that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> strategy was to continue to send heavily escorted bombers to destroy British airfields. Kesselring also advocated the use of Jagdgeschwader (fighter wings) in free-chase tactics. Messerschmitt Bf 109 single-engine fighters were to be sent out {{in advance of the}} main raids to force the British fighters into large-scale air battles which, in theory, would destroy RAF aircraft in combat and deplete the British defences. However, this time, Kesselring changed his operational methods. In consultation with Hugo Sperrle, commanding Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet 3), he chose not to scatter his effort against a large number of targets. Instead, he narrowed down the targets to a short list in order to concentrate his strength and striking power. Sector stations RAF Kenley, North Weald, Hornchurch and Biggin Hill were chosen as the prime targets.|$|E
60|$|A moment passed. The {{crackling}} of {{the fire}} and the ticking of the clock were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> audible in <b>the</b> room.|$|R
60|$|They {{arrived at}} the old house, and stood, listening, {{in the shadow of}} <b>the</b> doorway. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> were those of distant barking dogs, and of the bugles at the barracks.|$|R
60|$|A torch spluttered {{suddenly}} in its sconce, and the fierce hissing of the fire--like some monster licking its chops over a bloody meal--were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> that disturbed <b>the</b> stillness that ensued.|$|R
25|$|By daybreak, the Marines had {{completed}} unloading their stores and equipment, though the artillery pieces and their ammunition were left aboard ship. The remaining companies of the battalion came ashore, and Company C was withdrawn from its isolated hill outpost. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> in the thickets was the cooing of mourning doves, a sound which Marines would later learn {{was a favorite}} signal call used by Spanish loyalist guerrilla forces.|$|E
25|$|Job was quiet, brief in words, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> {{heard from}} his lips was the Jesus prayer. For many days and weeks he would retreat into his locked cave, so narrow that entry is difficult, and so small that it was {{impossible}} to sit, stand or lie conveniently. From the long periods of kneeling, his knees were covered with wounds, and wearing knee-marks into the rock floor. His disciple Dosyfey recounts that he saw supernatural light coming from the depths of the cave, shining for two hours onto the opposite side of the church. Dosyfey records that at the sight was terrified and fell to the ground.|$|E
500|$|The album's cover artwork {{features}} {{a photo of}} Donald Fagen as a disc jockey, wearing a collared shirt and tie, speaking into a RCA 77DX microphone. In front of him is a turntable (16inch '50s model, with a [...] tonearm), an ashtray, and a pack of Chesterfield King cigarettes. Visible {{on the table with}} the record player, is the cover of the 1958 jazz album Sonny Rollins and the Contemporary Leaders (one of Fagen's favorite albums). On the wall behind is a large clock, indicating that the time is 4:09. An advertisement in Billboard shortly before the album's release described the album cover: [...] "At 4:09 a.m., silence and darkness have taken hold of the city. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> is the voice of The Nightfly". Fagen appeared on the album cover despite his reclusive nature. [...] "It was an autobiographical album so it seemed like I might as well go public with it," [...] he said. The cover was shot in Fagen's apartment in the Upper East Side of Manhattan by photographer James Hamilton. Two shoots were arranged because in the first, the RCA microphone was facing the wrong direction. Gale Sasson and Vern Yenor are credited with the cover's set design.|$|E
60|$|For {{some time}} the rapid dip of our paddles and {{the rush of}} our canoe through the water were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> that were heard. Then Peterkin spoke again. He could never keep silence for any great length of time.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{stifling}} afternoon. As I trod {{the yellow}} gravel the quivering atmosphere all but blinded me with its reflected glare. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> {{to be heard}} were the clang of a milkman's hand-cart, and the pirouettes of a distant piano.|$|R
50|$|Jayanti Majri {{is just a}} 10-minute {{drive from}} Chandigarh but it’s an {{altogether}} different world. Silence prevails here. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> that reach <b>the</b> ears are the rustling of leaves, the humming bees, fluttering wings of a butterfly and occasional clinking of a temple bell.|$|R
2500|$|The Dinosaur: big {{but not too}} bright—a sort of sauropod with spinal plates like a stegosaurus. [...] Sometimes called Gronk, {{which is}} <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> he makes (although he can talk fluently in recent strips).|$|E
2500|$|After {{his initial}} meeting with Chauvel at Lajjun on 22 September {{regarding}} the proposed pursuit, Allenby replied on 25 September to Wilson regarding pressure for an advance to Aleppo. [...] "I am firmly {{of the opinion}} that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> policy is to advance by stages as in the past, unless and until the War Cabinet is prepared to undertake a combined Naval and Military operation on a large scale at Alexandretta, and to maintain by sea the military forces employed in it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, a {{television}} advert was launched worldwide for the Renault Clio MTV Limited edition featuring {{a man who}} was saying [...] "Get up ah!" [...] all the time, it was actually <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> he can hear from a Clio passing {{in front of his house}} early in the morning, then the advert shows the five men inside the Clio and moving their heads to the rhythm of the James Brown song [...] "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine". Same advertising made in Argentina with the Clio II in 2000 with this song.|$|E
60|$|Around {{and around}} the room they circled, the boy always advancing, Paul of Merely always retreating. The din of their clashing swords and the heavy {{breathing}} of the older man were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds,</b> except as they brushed against a bench or a table.|$|R
60|$|For {{some time}} {{the click of}} the needles and the tick of the clock were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> audible, and <b>the</b> ex-pilot had just arrived at the {{conclusion}} that his friend had abandoned him to his fate, when there came a low tapping at the door.|$|R
60|$|The two lads {{remained}} motionless {{in the saddle}} for several minutes, listening. No other howl reached their ears, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> were that of the rushing stream as it tumbled over some rocks, and {{the cries of the}} night birds and the humming of the insects.|$|R
2500|$|In {{a speech}} to the Hawarden Amateur Horticultural Society on 17 August 1876, Gladstone remarked [...] "I am delighted to see how many young boys and girls have come forward to obtain honourable marks of {{recognition}} on this occasion,—if any effectual good is to be done to them, it must be done by teaching and encouraging them and helping them to help themselves. All the people who pretend to take your own concerns out of your own hands and to do everything for you, I won't say they are impostors; I won't even say they are quacks; but I do say they are mistaken people. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound,</b> healthy description of countenancing and assisting these institutions is that which teaches independence and self-exertion". Lord Kilbracken, one of Gladstone's secretaries added: ...|$|E
2500|$|The National Redoubt {{strategy}} was emphasized on 24 May 1941. Until this time {{only about two}} thirds of the Swiss Army had been mobilized. [...] Following the swift overrunning of the Balkan countries by German forces in April 1941, in which relatively low mountains had proven to be little barrier to the aggressive German forces, the entire Swiss army was mobilized. [...] The Swiss, lacking a significant armored force, drew the conclusion that withdrawal to the Redoubt was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> course. [...] Any actions in the Central Plateau would be delaying [...] actions only. This was publicly reported after Switzerland was surrounded by German and Italian forces, Guisan revealed on 25 July 1940 at the so-called Rütlirapport, a historic and highly-symbolic meeting of the Swiss army staff and the entire officer corps at the founding site of the Swiss confederation, that in case of attack the Swiss would only defend the high Alps including the important transalpine roads and rail links. [...] As a last resort, the army would make these routes useless to the Axis by destroying key bridges and tunnels. [...] This plan meant that the populated lowlands - including the economic centres of the country - would be effectively ceded to the Germans. [...] The gold reserves of the Swiss National Bank in Zürich were moved farther away from the German border, to the Gotthard Pass and to Bern.|$|E
2500|$|Hitler {{waited too}} long to order his {{soldiers}} to retreat from Normandy, leading Montgomery to write: [...] "He [...] refused to face <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> military course. As a result the Allies caused the enemy staggering losses in men and materials". Knowing via Ultra that Hitler was not planning to retreat from Normandy, Montgomery, on 6 August 1944, ordered that an envelopment operation against Army Group B with the First Canadian Army under Harry Crerar, which was to advance towards Falaise, the Second British Army under Sir Miles Dempsey was to advance towards Argentan and the Third American Army under George S. Patton was to advance to Alençon. On 11 August, Montgomery changed his plan with the Canadians to take Falaise and to meet the Americans at Argentan. The First Canadian Army launched two operations, Operation Totalize on 7 August which advanced only [...] in four days {{in the face of}} fierce German resistance and Operation Tractable on 14 August which finally took Falaise on 17 August. In view of the slow Canadian advance, Patton requested permission to take Falaise, but was refused by Bradley on 13 August, which prompted much controversy with many historians arguing that Bradley lacked aggression and that Montgomery should have overruled Bradley. The so-called [...] "Falaise Gap" [...] was closed on 22 August 1944, but several American generals, most notably Patton, accused Montgomery of being insufficiently aggressive in closing it, about 60,000 German soldiers were trapped in Normandy, but before 22 August, about 20,000 Germans had escaped through the [...] "Falaise Gap" [...] to fight another day. About 10,000 Germans had been killed in the Battle of the Falaise Gap, which led to a stunned Eisenhower, who viewed the battlefield on 24 August, to comment with horror {{that it was impossible to}} walk without stepping on corpses.|$|E

6000|$|... 'The {{table was}} laid for fifty persons, and was nearly full. They ate in perfect silence, {{and with such}} {{astonishing}} rapidity that their dinner was over literally before ours was begun; <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> heard were those produced by the knives and forks, with the unceasing chorus of coughing, ETC.' ...|$|R
60|$|The little {{party on}} the beach {{remained}} as if spell-bound while the fire destroyed what seemed like the last link which bound them to home. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> to be heard, save the roaring of the flames, were when a deep, quivering sigh came from Walter's lips, or Joe gave vent to a suppressed groan.|$|R
60|$|The {{settling}} of {{the falling}} embers was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> about us.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> {{that was}} not stilled at the Cæsar's bidding was--down below--the snarl of the angry panther.|$|E
60|$|The flies droning {{in the hot}} office made <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound.</b> Outside the partition, {{among the}} bales, was silence.|$|E
60|$|A halbert, {{a broken}} arrow, a deer-skin pegged {{out on the}} ground to dry, a bundle of faggots, a bare and {{blackened}} patch of grass, strewn with wood ashes, were tokens of recent habitation, though the reiterations of the nightingale, the deep tones of the blackbird and the hum of insects, were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> that broke <b>the</b> stillness.|$|R
60|$|For a while <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sounds</b> to {{be heard}} at the store were the {{rattling}} of the tin spoons and the gurgling intake of the juicy fruits by the cowpunchers, the stamping of the grazing ponies, and the singing of a doleful song by Sam as he contentedly brushed his stiff auburn hair for the twentieth time that day before a crinkly mirror.|$|R
60|$|Among {{all these}} soft <b>sounds</b> came not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> soft <b>sound</b> he cared to hear--the {{footfall}} of Elfride.|$|R
60|$|She {{said nothing}} in reply; and her low weeping was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>sound</b> that was heard, until Mr. Bounderby spoke.|$|E
