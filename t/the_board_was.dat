5|$|A {{catchment}} {{board for}} the Avon {{was created by the}} Land Drainage Act 1930 and became the Bristol Avon River Board under the River Boards Act 1948; <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>was</b> in turn replaced by the Bristol Avon River Authority under the Water Resources Act 1963. Twenty-five minor watercourses were added to the Authority's jurisdiction in 1973. Reorganisation in 1974 under the Water Act 1973 brought the Avon catchment into a new regional body, the Wessex Water Authority.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1913, Howe {{journeyed to}} Northwestern Ontario {{to take up}} his new post. <b>The</b> <b>Board</b> <b>was</b> {{headquartered}} in Fort William, Ontario, where Canadian wheat was transferred from rail to ship. The Board sought to build a series of large terminal grain elevators, which could process as well as store grain. The project would increase both capacity and competition—grain elevator companies had been accused by farmers' interests of charging excessive prices. The first such elevator for <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>was</b> raised in nearby Port Arthur, Ontario, and was acclaimed {{as one of the}} best grain elevators ever built in Canada, and one of the cheapest. Over the next two years, Howe traveled the West, supervising the construction of terminal elevators near major cities and ports. The capacity would be needed, as Canadian farmers increased production during the First World War.|$|E
5000|$|The rider {{uses the}} same {{pressure}} that would be applied if he/she is attempting to adopt a [...] "primo" [...] position (when <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>is</b> positioned on its side/edge); however, one foot <b>is</b> placed under <b>the</b> <b>board</b> so that <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>is</b> not completely in a [...] "dark" [...] position (when <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>is</b> upside down, with the griptape facing the ground). The other foot is then placed on the tail of <b>the</b> <b>board</b> when <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>is</b> upside down—the foot beneath <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>is</b> then used to scoop <b>the</b> <b>board</b> up, and then around. The rider then jumps onto <b>the</b> <b>board</b> to land in the starting position. Mullen invented the Casper 360 flip in 1983.|$|R

5|$|The Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees was {{initially}} composed of Bomis' three founders: Jimmy Wales {{and his two}} business partners, Michael Davis and Tim Shell. Shell and Davis were appointed to the board by Wales, but after Wikipedia community members complained that <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>was</b> composed of appointed individuals, the first elections were held in 2004. Two community members, Florence Devouard and Angela Beesley, were elected to the Board of Trustees.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 35 {{individuals}} who have served as mayor. Joshua Bean, elected in 1850, was the first mayor of the city. Edwin M. Capps, who served as mayor in the late 1800s and early 1900s, {{is the only person}} who served two non-consecutive terms. From 1852 to 1888, the city was run by a Board of Trustees and there was no elected mayor. However, the president of <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>was</b> called mayor as a courtesy.|$|E

5|$|According to U.S. officials, bin Laden {{was buried}} at sea because no country would accept his remains. Before {{disposing}} of the body, the U.S. called the Saudi government, who approved of burying {{the body in}} the ocean. Muslim religious rites were performed aboard Carl Vinson in the North Arabian Sea within 24 hours of bin Laden's death. Preparations began at 10:10am local time and at-sea burial was completed at 11am. The body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet and placed in a weighted plastic bag. An officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. Afterward, bin Laden's body was placed onto a flat board. <b>The</b> <b>board</b> <b>was</b> tilted upward {{on one side and the}} body slid off into the sea.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, {{and those who had}} not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. <b>The</b> <b>board</b> <b>was</b> also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E
5|$|After San Diego's {{bankruptcy}} in 1852, the State of California took over city government {{and ran the}} city with an appointed Board of Trustees during 18521888. The President of <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>was</b> called mayor by courtesy, {{although there was no}} official office of mayor. When the office of president was vacated due to death or resignation, the board of trustees would choose a president pro tempore to preside over meetings until a permanent president could be elected by the board.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>board,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> union's highest {{executive}} body between the members meetings. The members of <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>are</b> appointed by direct {{vote of the}} students in the spring. An Election Committee which is formed by volunteer students, directs the elections in which all union members have voting rights. <b>The</b> <b>board</b> <b>is</b> responsible to implement the decisions taken at members meeting and is supposed to give a report to members meeting about the union activities. <b>The</b> <b>board</b> <b>is</b> also responsible for the union's economy in terms of budgeting and budget tracking. The issues that are too urgent to be dealt with in members meeting, are taken care of by <b>The</b> <b>board.</b> <b>The</b> members should represent a diversity of gender, age and education area. <b>The</b> <b>board</b> <b>is</b> headed by a president who is assisted with a vice president. Both president and vice president are elected by direct votes.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Board</b> of Aldermen, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{legislative}} {{body of the}} independent City of St. Louis, Missouri. <b>The</b> <b>Board</b> of Aldermen <b>is</b> charged with passing legislation, known as board bills, which after passage of <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>are</b> sent to <b>the</b> Mayor to be signed into law. <b>The</b> <b>Board</b> serves as a check against the mayor in a mayor-council government model. <b>The</b> <b>Board</b> monitors performance of city agencies and makes land use decisions as well as legislating {{on a variety of}} other issues. <b>The</b> <b>Board</b> also has sole responsibility for approving the city budget.

5|$|An edition called OGRE: Deluxe Edition was {{released}} in 1987. The rulebook cover artwork was the Denis Loubet illustration that was also used for the Ogre computer game (see Spinoffs below). <b>The</b> <b>board</b> <b>was</b> sturdier than the previous edition's paper map, and the counters were provided with stand-up plastic bases. G.M. magazine's 1989 review of OGRE: Deluxe Edition highlighted the game's ease of introduction and short playing time, but pointed out that most gamers either like the game or loathe it.|$|E
5|$|As CGS, Duigan {{proved to}} be an undistinguished {{appointment}} and was not particularly well regarded by the politicians of the day. He implemented several organisational changes, one of which was the disestablishment of the GOC position and its replacement with an army board to control the military. When <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>was</b> established in November 1937, it included Fred Jones, the Minister of Defence, and Duigan as first military member. Duigan offered little counter to the favouring of the fledgling Royal New Zealand Air Force by the New Zealand Government of the time, and this affected morale within the army.|$|E
5|$|Early in the Society's history, {{when its}} focus was still {{primarily}} literary, membership was considered {{by a committee}} {{for three days and}} then voted upon. By 1908, that model had been abandoned in favor of an open system in which any student who paid an annual fee could be part of the group. At that time, Philaletheis was governed by a six-member board consisting of a president and vice-president (both seniors), secretary, treasurer, and props manager (juniors), and an assistant props manager (a sophomore). In 1951, <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>was</b> vastly expanded to include managers of scenery, lights, sound, makeup, publicity, {{and a number of other}} fields.|$|E

5|$|Enron's {{aggressive}} {{accounting practices}} were not {{hidden from the}} board of directors, as later learned by a Senate subcommittee. <b>The</b> <b>board</b> <b>was</b> informed of the rationale for using the Whitewing, LJM, and Raptor transactions, and after approving them, received status updates on the entities' operations. Although not all of Enron's widespread improper accounting practices were revealed to the board, the practices were dependent on board decisions. Even though Enron extensively relied on derivatives for its business, the company's Finance Committee and board {{did not have enough}} experience with derivatives to understand what they were being told. The Senate subcommittee argued that had there been a detailed understanding of how the derivatives were organized, the board would have prevented their use.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Edward Dean Adams, {{impressed}} {{with what he}} saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions {{as well as new}} ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. <b>The</b> <b>board</b> <b>was</b> filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney. It found few investors; the mid-1890s was a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out. The company would handle Tesla's patents for decades to come.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Taylor {{was elected}} Attorney General of Kentucky, and served until 1899. During his term, state senator William Goebel {{proposed}} an election law {{that created a}} state Board of Elections which was empowered to appoint all election officers in every county and certify all election results. <b>The</b> <b>board</b> <b>was</b> to be appointed by the General Assembly, {{and there were no}} requirements that its composition be bi-partisan. The law was widely seen as a power play by Goebel, designed to ensure Democratic victories in state elections, including Goebel's own anticipated run for governor. The law passed the General Assembly, but was vetoed by Republican governor William O. Bradley. The General Assembly promptly overrode the veto. As attorney general, Taylor opined that the bill was unconstitutional. The measure was adjudicated by the Kentucky Court of Appeals and found to be constitutional.|$|E
