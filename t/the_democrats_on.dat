25|$|Following the election, Lieberman {{struck a}} deal with Democratic {{leadership}} allowing him to keep his seniority and chairmanship of the Governmental Affairs Committee.

500|$|Theramenes ( [...] ; died 404 BC) was an Athenian statesman, {{prominent}} in the final decade of the Peloponnesian War. He was particularly active during the two periods of oligarchic government at Athens, {{as well as in}} the trial of the generals who had commanded at Arginusae in 406 BC. A moderate oligarch, he often found himself caught between <b>the</b> <b>democrats</b> <b>on</b> the one hand and the extremist oligarchs on the other. Successful in replacing a narrow oligarchy with a broader one in 411 BC, he failed to achieve the same end in 404 BC, and was executed by the extremists whose policies he had opposed.|$|E

In 2012, Ryan explained his support for defense spending sequestration in the hope that this would open common ground with <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>on</b> deficit reduction. His comments led defense industry leaders to pin their final hopes on the chance that Congress would at least allow the Pentagon to direct the coming cuts.|$|E
500|$|Historian Annette Atkins has {{explored}} the changing long-term pattern of Minnesota politics. [...] In {{the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century, the heavily rural state was hostile to business and railroads, with the Republicans dominant in the small towns, and <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>on</b> the farms. [...] Numerous left-wing groups and third-parties emerged, such as the Anti-Monopolist party in the 1870s, the Populists in the 1890s, the Non-Partisan League in the 1910s, and the Farmer-Labor party in the 1930s. [...] Isolationism was strong, Atkins argues, because of the fear that Eastern bankers and industrialists forced the United States into World War I to enlarge their profits. Business fought unions, and the unions fought back, and with the governor on their side unions won some violent battles in the 1930s. [...] In recent decades, however, the liberal coalition has weakened. [...] Labor unions are a shadow of their old strength. [...] Most farmers have left for the towns and especially the Twin Cities, where half the people live. [...] The state high income tax is troublesome, and complaints are often heard about to generous welfare benefits. [...] The New Right has mobilized social conservatives, especially those from traditional religious backgrounds, with abortion a furiously contested issue. [...] State government has become much more friendly toward growth and the needs of business entrepreneurship. [...] Environmentalism has split left and right, with the industrial workers in the Up North and Iron Range districts demanding that their jobs be protected from environmentalists.
