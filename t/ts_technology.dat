The dramatic increase in cost of producing goods and services {{in the midst of}} ever increasing cost of oil and other raw materials places huge pressure on the economies of newly developing countries. This study analyses the gap in literature where there is paucity of studies in analysing STM application in the countries in the East. A conceptual framework has been proposed and tested.

40|$|Richard Florida’s works {{stand out}} as the holy {{writings}} of the ‘creative age’. Presented as iconoclastic, {{they set out to}} break down the ‘artificial boundaries ’ between the creative and the economic. They have spurred considerable debate and critique from different quarters: conservatives have mainly focused on cultural issues, such as how Florida’s work questions traditional family values, while progressive commentators have stressed the elitist implications of this new ‘class ’ discourse accused of insidiously promoting a neoliberal agenda. In this paper, we elaborate on the latter critique. Drawing on Foucault’s concept of governmentality, we aim to describe how ‘creative class ’ members are governed by the new creative ethos. Following the framework introduced by Dean, we study:- What is being governed: the creative class, allegedly representing one third of the ‘most advanced ’ Western societies, and driving their economic growth- How government is achieved: through a scientific guise, i. e. the introduction of the three <b>Ts</b> (<b>Technology,</b> Talent and Tolerance) and the correlations established between them and economic success- Who we become when governed: workaholic, consumerist and apolitical ‘bohemians ’ who value individuality, meritocracy, diversity and openness; bu...|$|E
40|$|The {{creative}} {{economy is a}} hard fish to catch, a difficult category to nail down. But it is bigger and broader than we think, and {{is much more than}} culture and the arts. The usual arguments in favour of support for the arts have served us well for a long time. For fifty years or more, cultural economists have given governments good reason to subsidise the arts, with usually bipartisan goodwill. The idea of the cultural industries the large, mostly commercial, businesses in broadcasting, music and film which deliver popular culture has given governments reasons to regulate and develop modern cultural policies to support them, and they have done so since the 1960 s with a similar commitment. However, the arts are now essentially in steady-state mode with respect to state support, while the business models of the cultural industries are facing confronting challenges. The three <b>Ts</b> <b>technology</b> (the Internet, games and mobile devices), taste (Generations X and Y and the ‘millenials’ are not into the mass media {{in the same way as}} their elders were), and talent (creatively and technologically literate young people are finding other creative channels) are presenting a formidable challenge to the traditional arguments. What is urgently needed is a forward-looking view of what a ‘{{creative economy}}’ might look like, and what it might take to strengthen it. We propose a shift from a sector-specific attention to the creative industries as one part of the economy, to the creative economy where creative occupations and intermediate outputs provide a significant input to wider innovation and growth...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{presenting}} preliminary results from 4 <b>T</b> <b>technology</b> based CMOS image sensors with global shutter, i. e. all pixels {{in the active}} array integrate light simultaneously. The global shutter operation mode is particularly important for high-speed video applications, where the more commonly implemented rolling line shutter creates motion blur.

Different from conventional 3 T type CMOS image sensors with global shutter pixel, in these 4 <b>T</b> <b>technology</b> based global shutter pixels, the charge is transferred, not just sampled, onto the sense node. This translates into very high sensitivity and low readout noise at low power. For an imager with 7 transistors per pixel that is operated in global shutter, “Integrate While Read ” mode, we measure an input referred noise of 10 electrons.
