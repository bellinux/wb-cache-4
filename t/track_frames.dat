50|$|In 1988, Corima diversified into carbon {{composite}} parts and its first product for cycling : the disc wheel. This {{was followed by}} the 4-spoke wheel, the Puma monocoque frame, the Aero wheel, the Ellipse seatpost and others to create a range of carbon products. In 1994, Corima expanded to frames, achieving success with the Puma, an aerodynamic carbon monocoque road frame with a steeply sloping top tube, based on the custom <b>track</b> <b>frame</b> ridden by Chris Boardman in 1993. However, production was discontinued in 1999, due to revised UCI rules that rendered the Puma's geometry inconsistent with racing frame guidelines. This banning from competition meant limited exposure and sponsorships. Corima continued making a <b>track</b> <b>frame</b> with similar geometry and sloping top tube - the Cougar - until it was replaced by the VIF frame.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{technique}} for acquiring detailed facial geometry of a dynamic performance using extended spherical gradient illumination. Key to our method {{is a new}} algorithm for jointly aligning two photographs, under a gradient illumination condition and its complement, to a full-on <b>tracking</b> <b>frame,</b> providing dense temporal correspondences under changing lighting conditions. We employ a two-step algorithm to reconstruct detailed geometry for every captured frame. In the first step, we coalesce information from the gradient illumination frames to the full-on <b>tracking</b> <b>frame,</b> and form a temporally aligned photometric normal map, which is subsequently combined with dense stereo correspondences yielding a detailed geometry. In a second step, we propagate the detailed geometry back to every captured instance guided by the previously computed dense correspondences. We demonstrate reconstructed dynamic facial geometry, captured using moderate to video rates of acquisition, for every captured frame...|$|R
50|$|The machine {{concept was}} a {{standard}} base to each model on which optional front-end equipment could be mounted with appropriate counterbalances, crawler <b>track</b> <b>frames</b> and minimal additional machinery. The most common variants included face shovel, dragline, lifting crane and grabbing crane. Less common variants included drag shovel, skimmer and pile driver. Some cranes were also lorry-mounted. All machines had 360 degree rotation on a conical section roller path.|$|E
50|$|The {{objective}} of this prototype {{was to develop a}} lightweight vehicle capable of crossing wide trenches {{in a manner similar to}} the then-conventional heavy British tanks. Unlike the British tanks with their fully enclosed chassis, the Skeleton Tank achieved the requisite lozenge shape by supporting its tracks with a skeleton-like framework formed from ordinary iron pipes joined by standard plumbing connections. Suspended between these <b>track</b> <b>frames</b> was an armored fighting compartment carrying a machine gun turret. The engines were also housed in this armor-protected box.|$|E
50|$|The {{tank was}} based on a {{lengthened}} and modified version of the suspension of the Holt Model 75, with pivoting <b>track</b> <b>frames.</b> There were ten road wheels at each side. The tank was 7 ft tall, 16 ft long, and 9 ft wide. The vehicle had a Holt , 4-cylinder engine fitted with a General Electric generator driving an electric motor for each track; a comparable petro-electric system had earlier been used for the French Saint-Chamond that also was fitted with a lengthened Holt suspension. To prevent overheating the transmission—a constant problem with electrical types—a complicated water cooling system had been installed.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the years}} the OC-9 was in production, there were only slight {{modifications}} and improvements made to the design. The most notable was the blade push trunnions and hydraulic ram mounting positions. The only real variant of the OC-9 was a track loader designated the OC-96, built on the same design as the OC-9. The OC-96 was modified slightly {{to allow for the}} loader configuration: the final drives were rotated slightly to allow the position of the tracks to be farther in front of the machine. The <b>track</b> <b>frames</b> were lighter duty, and some changes to the chassis allowed the loader arms to be fitted.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the ready}} {{availability}} of Italian frames, Wayne became a much revered Aussie icon for supplying road and <b>track</b> <b>frames</b> for Australia’s elite - professionals and Olympians. His own son and Olympic medalist Luke Roberts, {{a star on}} both surfaces in his own right, rode a prototype of the Culo Carbonio frame to victory in a stage of the Tour Down Under, giving the marque its first taste of global recognition. Accolades came {{not just from the}} peloton, but also from the tubing suppliers in Italy, who were impressed with Wayne’s classic eye and attention to the finest construction and finishing detail and delighted to see a rider on a steel frame atop the podium in a UCI race.|$|E
50|$|On 11 August actual {{construction}} began; on 16 August Tritton {{decided to}} fit a wheeled tail to assist in steering. On 9 September the Number 1 Lincoln Machine, as the prototype was then known, made its first test run in the yard of the Wellington Foundry. It {{soon became clear that}} the track profiles were so flat that ground resistance during a turn was excessive. To solve this, the suspension was changed so that the bottom profile was more curved. Then the next problem showed up: when crossing a trench the track sagged and then would not fit the wheels again and jammed. The tracks were also not up to carrying the weight of the vehicle (about 16 tons). Tritton and Lieutenant Walter Gordon Wilson tried several types of alternative track design, including balatá belting and flat wire ropes. Tritton, on 22 September, devised a robust but outwardly crude system using pressed steel plates riveted to cast links and incorporated guides to engage {{on the inside of the}} track frame. The <b>track</b> <b>frames</b> as a whole were connected to the main body by large spindles. This system was unsprung, as the tracks were held firmly in place, able to move in only one plane. This was a successful design and was used on all First World War British tanks up to the Mark VIII, although it limited speed.|$|E

The undercarriage includes the blade (if fitted), <b>tracks,</b> <b>track</b> <b>frame,</b> and final drives, {{which have a}} hydraulic motor and gearing providing the drive to the individual tracks, and the house includes the operator cab, counterweight, engine, fuel and hydraulic oil tanks. The house attaches to the undercarriage {{by way of a}} center pin. High pressure oil is supplied to the tracks' hydraulic motors through a hydraulic swivel at the axis of the pin, allowing the machine to slew 360° unhindered.|$|R
5000|$|Company {{photographer}} Charles Clements {{was reported}} to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar, and Holt seized on the metaphor. [...] "Caterpillar it is. That's the name for it!" [...] Some sources, though, attribute this name to British soldiers in July 1907. Two years later Holt sold his first steam-powered tractor crawlers for US$5,500, about US$128,000 today. Each side featured a <b>track</b> <b>frame</b> measured 30 in high by 42 in wide and were 9 ft long. The tracks were 3 in by 4 in redwood slats.|$|R
50|$|To {{improve its}} trench {{crossing}} ability to 4.88 m the vehicle {{had a very}} elongated shape. The track length was 34 ft 2 in (10.42 m) but even though the hull width was an impressive nominal 3.76 m, the actual length-width ratio of the tracks was very poor as that width included the sponsons. Combined with wide tracks it proved difficult to turn the tank. During testing many tracks twisted and broke in a turn and {{it was decided to}} use longer, stronger 13.25 inch (337 mm) links made of hardened cast armour plate, stiffened by webs formed by recesses in the track plate. Another effect of the narrow hull was that the fighting compartment was also very narrow. This was made worse by the fact that now the gap between the double <b>track</b> <b>frames</b> at each side was very wide; earlier types had only the tracks themselves widened. Nevertheless the tank was supposed to accommodate another twenty infantry men in full gear if necessary. In absolute terms the vehicle was very large: at 10 ft 3 in (3.13 m) tall the Mark VIII was the second largest operational tank in history, after the Char 2C. However its weight was only 38.3 LT fitted for battle as the armour plate was thin with a thickness of 16 mm on the front and sides—a slight improvement over the Mark V but very thin by later standards. The roof and bottom of the hull were protected by only 6 mm thick armour plate, leaving the tank very vulnerable to mortar shells and landmines.|$|E
40|$|In {{digital storage}} media, Video {{segmentation}} {{is one of}} the popular and important techniques. The challenging problem in digital storage media is video segmentation. In this hybrid video segmentation technique, initially similar shots are segmented. Then subsequently the <b>track</b> <b>frames</b> in every shot areassorted using the extracted objects of every frame which highly mostly reduces the processing time. Here it yields the effective video segmentation results by performing intersection on the segmented resultsprovided by both the frame difference method as well as consecutive frame intersection method. In frame difference method, it considers the key frame as background and it segments the dynamic objects whereas in the frame difference method, it segments the static and dynamic objects by intersection of objects in consecutive frames. This new hybrid video segmentation technique is developed using FKM clustering approach and is evaluated by varying video sequences and then efficiency is analyzed by calculating the statistical measures and kappa coefficient...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an end-to-end video face recogni-tion system, addressing the difficult problem of identifying a video face track using a large dictionary of still face im-ages {{of a few}} hundred people, while rejecting unknown in-dividuals. A straightforward application of the popular 1 -minimization for face recognition on a frame-by-frame ba-sis is prohibitively expensive, so we propose a novel algo-rithm Mean Sequence SRC (MSSRC) that performs video face recognition using a joint optimization leveraging all of the available video data and the knowledge that the face <b>track</b> <b>frames</b> belong to the same individual. By adding a strict temporal constraint to the 1 -minimization that forces individual frames in a face track to all reconstruct a sin-gle identity, we show the optimization reduces to a single minimization over the mean of the face track. We also in-troduce a new Movie Trailer Face Dataset collected from 101 movie trailers on YouTube. Finally, we show that our method matches or outperforms the state-of-the-art on three existing datasets (YouTube Celebrities, YouTube Faces, and Buffy) and our unconstrained Movie Trailer Face Dataset. More importantly, our method excels at rejecting unknown identities by at least 8 % in average precision. 1...|$|E

30|$|We aim to {{constrain}} the tracking algorithm to construct approximately n trajectories, where n {{is the number}} with the highest probability, estimated by the counting algorithm described in Section 4. Two relevant parameters can intuitively be formulated: the number of targets <b>tracked</b> per <b>frame</b> and {{the total number of}} trajectories in each stable period. Ideally, since we are only concerned about stable periods, the total number of trajectories within a period should correspond to the number of targets <b>tracked</b> in each <b>frame.</b> However, if the trajectory of one person is fragmented into shorter tracks, the total number of trajectories will increase while the correct number of targets can still be <b>tracked</b> in every <b>frame.</b> Likewise, if the target is lost during the sequence, the total number of trajectories might be correct, while some frames have fewer targets. Therefore, both measures might be valid parameters to include in the optimisation.|$|R
