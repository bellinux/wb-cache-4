5|$|The {{reason for}} this {{grouping}} is unclear; they certainly cannot be attributed to an attempt to match <b>the</b> <b>lay</b> <b>of</b> the river bed. The differences however could point to the repeated use of differently-sized falsework structures {{in the construction of}} the barrel vaults (see animation below).|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time there was a change in castle architecture. Until the late 12thcentury castles {{generally}} had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrowslits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by <b>the</b> <b>lay</b> <b>of</b> the land (the result was often irregular or curvilinear structures). The design of castles was not uniform, but these were features that could be found in a typical castle in the mid-12thcentury. By the end of the 12thcentury or the early 13thcentury, a newly constructed castle could be expected to be polygonal in shape, with towers at the corners to provide enfilading fire for the walls. The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level to allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall.|$|E
5|$|Between 1142 and 1170 the Knights Hospitaller {{undertook}} a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between two towers {{on the eastern}} side, {{and there was a}} postern gate in the northwest tower. At the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers. <b>The</b> <b>lay</b> <b>of</b> the land dictated the castle's irregular shape. A site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles and steep slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle's defences were concentrated. This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle's construction.|$|E

25|$|The {{oldest and}} most celebrated of the chansons de geste is The Song of Roland (earliest version {{composed}} c. 1098), seen by some as the national epic of France (comparable with Beowulf in England, the Song of the Nibelungs in Germany and <b>the</b> <b>Lay</b> <b>of</b> el Cid in Spain). It is perhaps {{no coincidence that the}} Song of Roland was first written down at a date very close to that of Pope Urban's call (1095) for the First Crusade; its plot may be seen as a glorification of the crusader ethos.|$|E
