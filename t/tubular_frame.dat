50|$|The Letov Š-31 was {{a fighter}} {{aircraft}} produced in Czechoslovakia {{in the early}} 1930s {{in a number of}} variants. All of the aircraft had metal <b>tubular</b> <b>framing</b> and fabric covering with a metal engine cowling.|$|R
2500|$|Lacking {{sufficient}} {{capital to}} develop a new model, Hudson reached an agreement for a prototype to be built in Milan by Carrozzeria Touring. A complete Hudson Jet was shipped to Italy. A new body design, based on sketches by Frank Spring, was formed over a steel <b>tubular</b> <b>frame.</b> This unibody system of aluminum panels was known as [...] superleggera (equivalent to “very lightweight” in Italian), and [...] "was expensive and fairly revolutionary in its day." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Indian 841 {{was heavily}} {{inspired}} by the BMW R71 motorcycle (which, though not used by the German Army later {{was the basis for}} the Soviet M72, which is the basis for the Ural and Chiang Jiang motorcycle) as was its competitor, the Harley-Davidson XA. [...] However, unlike the XA, the 841 was not a copy of the R71. Although its <b>tubular</b> <b>frame,</b> plunger rear suspension, and shaft drive were similar to the BMW's, the 841 was different from the BMW in several aspects, most noticeably so with its 90-degree longitudinal-crankshaft V-twin engine and girder fork.|$|E
2500|$|Gull-wing doors have a {{somewhat}} questionable reputation because of early examples like the Mercedes and the Bricklin. The 300 SL needed the door design as its <b>tubular</b> <b>frame</b> race car chassis design {{had a very}} high door sill, which in combination with a low roof would make a standard door opening very low and small. The Mercedes engineers solved the problem by also opening {{a part of the}} roof. The Bricklin was a more conventionally sized door but the actuation system was problematic in day-to-day use and led to unreliable operation until an aftermarket air-door upgrade was installed in all Bricklins. [...] In addition, there was some concern that in making the doors as light as possible they wouldn't provide adequate protection in side-impact accidents. There was, however, no indication that this concern was justified.|$|E
50|$|Columbia mopeds {{were the}} first mopeds ever {{assembled}} in the United States, even though the motor and some parts were outsourced.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Columbia sold {{the rights and}} design of their mopeds to a company, KKM Enterprises, Inc. that {{produced}} identical mopeds under the name Mopet into the mid-1990s. This company produced the <b>tubular</b> <b>frames,</b> long seats, fenders, wheels, hubs, brakes, front fork assembly, headlight, and wiring harnesses in the United States.|$|R
2500|$|In 1967 Lotus {{introduced}} the Lotus 49, {{powered by the}} Ford-Cosworth DFV V8 engine that was to dominate Formula One for the next decade. Like the Repco the Cosworth was light and compact {{but it was a}} real racing engine using 4-valve DOHC heads and delivered much more power. Cosworth had aimed for [...] and exceeded this when the engine first ran. The DFV was designed to be fully stressed (an idea pioneered by the Lancia D50). This allowed Chapman to design a monocoque that ended just after the driver's seat while the Brabham were still using a very classic <b>tubular</b> <b>frame</b> that supported the engine, the gearbox and the rear suspension wishbones. The newborn DFV suffered from frequent failures due to excessive vibration from the flat-plane crank, forcing Keith Duckworth to redesign several parts and allowing Hulme to win the World Drivers' Crown on reliability.|$|E
2500|$|And {{the first}} {{all-metal}} aircraft built by this company was the Hamilton Metalplane H-18 christened the “Maiden Milwaukee” in 1927. [...] Its design {{came from the}} chief designer of the Metalplane Company of the time – James McDonnell. [...] McDonnell had worked for Stout and Ford and incorporated similar features and new ideas into {{the construction of the}} metal Maiden. The Hamilton H-18 used a <b>tubular</b> <b>frame</b> with corrugated skin, a thick mono wing projecting out of the fuselage underneath the open cockpit, at the front was the 200 HP J-4 Wright Radial engine, and using a Hamilton propeller (metal) as a means of propulsion. [...] The “Maiden Milwaukee” was the first plane produced by the Hamilton Metalplane Company and it achieved a number of awards. [...] It first came in second during the Ford Air Tour of 1927 and it won the Spokane Air Races of the same year. It was also given the distinction of being the first US air certificate for an all-metal airplane in the United States. It was a plane designed to haul mail with the passengers as an extra revenue bonus for the airline. [...] The design reflects this for the wing root came right out of the center of the fuselage and hardly any passengers could fit.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Fuller {{began the}} Otisco Project, named after its {{location}} in Otisco, New York. The project developed and demonstrated concrete spray with mesh-covered wireforms for producing large-scale, load-bearing spanning structures built on-site, {{without the use}} of pouring molds, other adjacent surfaces or hoisting. The initial method used a circular concrete footing in which anchor posts were set. Tubes cut to length and with ends flattened were then bolted together to form a duodeca-rhombicahedron (22-sided hemisphere) geodesic structure with spans ranging to [...] The form was then draped with layers of ¼-inch wire mesh attached by twist ties. Concrete was sprayed onto the structure, building up a solid layer which, when cured, would support additional concrete to be added by a variety of traditional means. Fuller referred to these buildings as monolithic ferroconcrete geodesic domes. However, the <b>tubular</b> <b>frame</b> form proved problematic for setting windows and doors. It was replaced by an iron rebar set vertically in the concrete footing and then bent inward and welded in place to create the dome's wireform structure and performed satisfactorily. Domes up to three stories tall built with this method proved to be remarkably strong. Other shapes such as cones, pyramids and arches proved equally adaptable.|$|E

5000|$|The MS.230 was {{designed}} to meet French Air Ministry requirements.
