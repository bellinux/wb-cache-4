5|$|Because Alaska and Guam {{were the}} only two ships to mount these guns, only ten turrets were made during the war (three for each ship {{including}} Hawaii and one spare). <b>They</b> <b>cost</b> $1,550,000 each and were the most expensive heavy guns purchased by the U.S. Navy in World War II.|$|E
5|$|The {{cast for}} Planet B {{comes from the}} Radio Drama Company, a {{repertory}} radio company. This is because <b>they</b> <b>cost</b> nothing to use and the budget for the show is small. The cast of the Radio Drama Company changes around every six months, which means that cast of Planet B changes every series.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Ibuki class was a minor {{improvement}} over the last pair of the Mogami class after those ships had been upgraded during the late 1930s. The main improvement was {{the replacement of the}} triple torpedo tube mounts in the older ships with quadruple mounts. <b>They</b> <b>cost</b> 60,000,000 yen each and had a crew of 54 officers and 822 enlisted men.|$|E

5|$|Like Compton, many U.S. {{officials}} and scientists {{argued that a}} demonstration would sacrifice the shock value of the atomic attack, and the Japanese could deny the atomic bomb was lethal, making the mission less likely to produce surrender. Allied prisoners of war might be moved to the demonstration site and be killed by the bomb. They also worried that the bomb might be a dud since the Trinity test was of a stationary device, not an air-dropped bomb. In addition, only two bombs would be available {{at the start of}} August, although more were in production, and <b>they</b> <b>cost</b> billions of dollars, so using one for a demonstration would be expensive.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty's {{decision}} saddled the Royal Navy {{with a pair}} {{of ships}} that could not operate with the Warriors in a tactical squadron and were inferior to the French ironclads then under construction. The naval architect Sir Nathaniel Barnaby, a future Constructor of the Navy, considered that a Defence-class ship was worth one quarter of a Warrior in terms of combat, although <b>they</b> <b>cost</b> about two-thirds as much.|$|E
5|$|The Kungas of pre-Akkadian Nagar {{were used}} for drawing the {{carriages}} of kings before the domestication of the horse, and a royal procession included up to fifty animals. The kungas of Nagar were in great demand in the Eblaite empire; <b>they</b> <b>cost</b> two kilos of silver, fifty times {{the price of a}} donkey, and were imported regularly by the monarchs of Ebla to be used as transport animals and gifts for allied cities. The horse was known in the region during the third millennium BC, but was not used as a draught animal before c. 18th century BC.|$|E

50|$|For {{the use of}} Swiss {{motorways}} the use of toll stickers is obligatory. <b>They</b> <b>costs</b> 40 CHF {{per year}} per vehicle (a car towing a trailer needs two stickers). There are no stickers for shorter periods and they are valid 14 months (the 2010 sticker is valid from 1 December 2009 until 31 January 2011). However, this also means that a sticker bought {{any time during the}} year can only be used for less than the maximum period until January 31 of the following year.|$|R
5|$|The {{value of}} the Admiralty Islands to the Allies was enormous. Their capture saved more lives than <b>they</b> <b>cost</b> by obviating the need to capture Truk, Kavieng, Rabaul, and Hansa Bay and thereby {{speeding}} up the Allied advance by several months. As an airbase, the Admiralties' value was great, for aircraft based there ranged over Truk, Wewak, and beyond. As a naval base, their value was greater still, as they combined a fleet anchorage with major facilities.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began in}} late 2003 at Barrandov Studios in Prague, Czech Republic, {{where most of}} the filming took place. Production {{designer}} Richard Bridgland was in charge of sets, props and vehicles, based on early concept art Anderson had created to give a broad direction of how things would look. 25 to 30 life-sized sets were constructed at Barrandov Studios, many of which were interiors of the pyramid. The pyramid's carvings, sculptures, and hieroglyphs were influenced by Egyptian, Cambodian, and Aztec civilisations, while the regular shifting of the pyramid's rooms was meant to evoke a sense of claustrophobia similar to the original Alien film. According to Anderson, if he was to build the sets in Los Angeles they would have cost $20 million. However, in Prague <b>they</b> <b>cost</b> $2 million, an important factor when the film's budget was less than $50 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} sector continued to perform poorly and by Brezhnev's final year, food shortages were reaching disturbing levels of frequency. Particularly embarrassing {{to the regime}} {{was the fact that}} even bread had become rationed, one commodity that they always prided themselves on being available. One reason for this was excessive consumer demand as food prices remained artificially low while incomes had trebled over the last 20 years. Despite the miserable failure of collective farming, the Soviet government remained committed to reducing imports of foodstuffs from the West even though <b>they</b> <b>cost</b> less than domestic production, not only for reasons of national pride, but out of fear of becoming dependent on capitalist countries for basic necessities.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} after the war, many teams in Europe were forced to wear unusual kits due to clothing restrictions. England's Oldham Athletic, who had traditionally worn blue and white, spent two seasons playing in red and white shirts borrowed from a local rugby league club, and Scotland's Clyde wore khaki. In the 1950s kits worn by players in southern Europe and South America became much more lightweight, with V-necks replacing collars on shirts and synthetic fabrics replacing heavy natural fibres. The first boots to be cut below the ankle rather than high-topped were introduced by Adidas in 1954. Although <b>they</b> <b>cost</b> {{twice as much as}} existing styles the boots were a huge success and cemented the German company's place in the football market. Around the same time Adidas also developed the first boots with screw-in studs which could be changed according to pitch conditions. Other areas were slower to adopt the new styles – British clubs again resisted change and stuck resolutely to kits little different from those worn before the war, and Eastern European teams continued to wear kits that were deemed old-fashioned elsewhere. The FC Dynamo Moscow team that toured Western Europe in 1945 drew almost as much comment for the players' long baggy shorts as for the quality of their football. With the advent of international competitions such as the European Cup, the southern European style spread {{to the rest of the}} continent and by the end of the decade the heavy shirts and boots of the pre-war years had fallen entirely out of use. The 1960s saw little innovation in kit design, with clubs generally opting for simple colour schemes which looked good under the newly adopted floodlights. Designs from the late 1960s and early 1970s are highly regarded by football fans.|$|E
