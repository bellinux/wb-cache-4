5|$|Cincinnati {{gained a}} 7–0 {{lead in the}} first quarter, but Virginia Tech scored 10 {{unanswered}} points to take a 10–7 lead into halftime. In the second half, Virginia Tech extended its lead as its defense kept the Bearcats scoreless. A Tech field goal {{in the third quarter}} was followed by a touchdown in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter,</b> <b>and</b> the game ended with Virginia Tech on top, 20–7.|$|E
5|$|In that half, Tech pulled {{steadily}} {{away from}} the Tigers. Virginia Tech scored 13points {{in the third quarter}} and seven in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter,</b> <b>and</b> Clemson never seriously challenged the Hokies, who went on to record a 41–20 victory. The game was the final collegiate contest for Tech quarterback Michael Vick, who would go on to be selected as the first overall pick in the 2001 NFL Draft.|$|E
50|$|Separating {{the first}} and second halves is halftime. Teams change ends of the field {{at the end of the}} first <b>quarter</b> <b>and</b> the end of the third quarter. In the NFL, an {{automatic}} timeout is called by the officials when there are two minutes left in both <b>the</b> second <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarters,</b> <b>and</b> overtime; this is most commonly referred to as the two-minute warning. No such warning is normally given in amateur football, though if there is no visible stadium clock, the referee will give a two-minute warning (four minutes in high school).|$|R
50|$|In the Patriots' {{historic}} Super Bowl LI comeback {{against the}} Atlanta Falcons, Mitchell caught six passes for 70 yards. He was 5-for-5 on targets from Brady in <b>the</b> pivotal <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter,</b> <b>and</b> converted {{four of those}} five receptions into first downs.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Palmer threw a 6-yard strike to wide {{receiver}} T. J. Houshmandzadeh, but Browns defensive end, Simon Fraser, blocked the extra point.

With their second consecutive sweep of Cleveland, the Bengal record improved to 6-5.|$|R
5|$|Kafka {{entered the}} 2008 {{season as a}} backup quarterback behind C. J. Bachér. Against Syracuse, Kafka entered the game in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>and</b> rushed twice for 18yards. Against Southern Illinois, he threw two passes, {{completing}} one for one yard, in addition to rushing for threeyards. He played in the final series at Indiana and completed a pass, which went for nineyards.|$|E
5|$|While all of {{this was}} {{happening}} Arledge, who was also the president of the network's sports division, was presiding over ABC's telecast of Monday Night Football in his capacity as its executive producer.

5|$|Los Angeles lost in {{the finals}} to Boston in seven games again in 1966, this time by two points. Down by 16 {{entering}} <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter,</b> <b>and</b> 10 with {{a minute and a}} half to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments which fell just short. After dropping to 36 wins and losing in the first round of the 1967 NBA Playoffs, they {{lost in the}} finals to the Celtics again in 1968. Los Angeles moved to a brand-new arena, The Forum, in 1967, after playing seven seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena.|$|E
50|$|A two-minute {{warning was}} given in the first <b>and</b> third <b>quarters</b> (as well as in <b>the</b> second <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarters),</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ball changed hands after each quarter.|$|R

5|$|Ole Miss {{wasted no}} time in scoring, as Steve Hindman turned the first play of the second half into a 79-yard for a touchdown. The Rebels now held a 2117 lead, and Virginia Tech never {{threatened}} afterward. Ole Miss defender Bob Bailey intercepted a Virginia Tech pass at the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>and</b> returned it 70 yards for another Mississippi touchdown. The Rebels also added a pair of field goals to their score, and rolled to a 3417 victory over Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|To {{open the}} season, the All-Americans {{defeated}} the local, semi-pro team West Buffalo. Running back John Weldon scored a rushing touchdown {{early in the}} first quarter. Quarterback Tommy Hughitt and Weldon added touchdowns {{in the second quarter}} to make the score 19–0 going into halftime. Hughitt scored from a yard out in the third quarter to make the score 25–0. West Buffalo got on the scoreboard when Bob Langdon intercepted a Buffalo pass and ran it back 75yards for a touchdown. This was West Buffalo's only points scored their entire year. Buffalo finished off the scoring in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>and</b> won the game 32–6.|$|E
5|$|As with Georgia, Virginia Tech's {{kicking and}} special teams proved {{to have more}} success than either aspect of the offense. Virginia Tech kicker Brandon Pace scored a single 28-yard field goal late in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter,</b> <b>and</b> punter Nic Schmitt blasted four punts {{for a total of}} 195yards, {{averaging}} 48.8yards a punt. Pace's field goal helped to trigger a late-game rally by Virginia Tech, which had been stunned by a Georgia onside kick and several interceptions thrown by Glennon. Schmitt's long punts, meanwhile, denied Georgia good field position {{in the first half of}} the game. Only in the second half, when Glennon's interceptions allowed Georgia to start on the Tech side of the field, was the Georgia offense able to reach the end zone. In the first and second quarters, Georgia's average starting position was their own 19-yard line and own 26-yard line, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Florida State {{jumped out}} to a quick 28–7 lead {{in the first two}} {{quarters}} of play, but the Hokies closed the lead to a 28–14 margin by halftime with a 3-yard run from Vick. In the second half, Tech made its biggest run of the game as Kicker Shayne Graham kicked a field goal and tailback Andre Kendrick added two rushing touchdowns to give the Hokies their first and only lead—29–28—with just over three minutes left in the third quarter. But in the end, the Hokies could not contain Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke, who threw twotouchdowns in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>and</b> 329yards in the game. The Seminoles defeated Virginia Tech 46–29.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{travelled}} to Massachusetts to {{face the}} New England Patriots at Foxboro Stadium in Week 17. The game was a de facto home game, as many Giants fans made the trip up to Foxborough to sell the stadium out. The game had no playoff implications for the Giants, who could not surpass the 49ers for the #1 seed in the NFC playoffs. The Giants rushed for a season-high 213yards, led by Hostetler's 82yards on 10 carries. The Patriots' Jason Staurovsky missed a potential game-tying 42-yard field goal in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter,</b> <b>and</b> Hostetler then ran a 30-yard bootleg on a key third-down play to allow the Giants to run out the clock and secure the victory, 13–10.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{began the}} 2005 regular season ranked {{eighth in the}} country, and played their first game at ACC {{opponent}} North Carolina State. It was a close-fought game, but quarterback Marcus Vick threw a game-winning touchdown early in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>and</b> the defense slowed a late NC State rally as Virginia Tech earned a 2016 win. Following the close call against NC State, the Hokies blew out their next several opponents. Virginia Tech defeated Duke and Ohio by scores of 450 each. The Virginia Tech defense held Duke's offense to just 35total yards, an NCAA record. Following those victories, Tech hosted 15th-ranked Georgia Tech, beating the Yellow Jackets by a score of 517. Tech's defensive success in those games {{was typical of the}} season as Virginia Tech won the first eight games of its season.|$|E
50|$|In May 2007, Fifth Third {{announced}} {{the acquisition of}} R-G Crown Bank of Casselberry, Florida, a transaction that closed in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> of 2007 <b>and</b> which added 30 branches in Florida and three in Georgia.|$|R

50|$|Northern Illinois {{would prove}} to bounce back in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> however, <b>and</b> put three touchdowns on the board to win the game. The first came only 1 minute and 25 seconds into the quarter, as running back Chad Spann rushed 28 yards for a touchdown. Spann would score again with eight minutes {{remaining}} to put the Huskies ahead 20-10, and the game ended on a Nathan Palmer touchdown with only 46 seconds remaining.|$|R
5|$|The loss to Virginia brought Virginia Tech to an 83 regular-season record, {{something}} Tech coach Frank Beamer {{said was}} better than he expected at the season's start. Despite that sentiment, most fans and supporters pointed {{to the fact that}} in all of Virginia Tech's losses, the deciding points came late in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>and</b> {{near the end of the}} game. Only three plays separated Tech from an undefeated 110 record. Tech's bowl destination was unclear immediately after the Virginia loss. The Music City Bowl seemed likely, but the Micron PC Bowl, Insight.com Bowl, and Sun Bowl also were possibilities. Virginia Tech officials preferred the Music City Bowl because of its proximity to Virginia, and bowl officials selected the Hokies on November 30.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} preseason game on August 14 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Kafka went 3-for-7 for 76yards {{and threw a}} 57-yard pass to wide {{receiver}} Chad Hall after taking over for Vick late in the third quarter. Kafka began the second preseason game on August 20 against the Cincinnati Bengals in the fourth quarter. He went 4-for-12 for 29yards and two interceptions (both to cornerback Morgan Trent) with a passer rating of 2.4. He also had one carry for 24yards. On August 27 against the Kansas City Chiefs, Kafka came into the game in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>and</b> went 9-for-13 for 93yards and one touchdown. He led the Eagles on the winning drive with an 18-yard touchdown pass to Riley Cooper with 23 {{seconds left in the}} game to win, 20–17. In the final preseason game on September 2, Kafka replaced Vick during the second quarter and played for almost three quarters. He went 9-for-27 for 76yards and an interception against the New York Jets.|$|E
5|$|Lin {{made his}} debut for the Hornets in the team's season opener against the Miami Heat on October 28, scoring 17 points {{off the bench}} in a 104–94 loss. On December 17, he scored a season-high 35 points in a 109–99 {{overtime}} win over the Toronto Raptors. On March 21, 2016, he scored 15 of his 29 points {{in the fourth quarter}} to help Charlotte rally from a 30–7 deficit in the second quarter for a 91–88 comeback victory over San Antonio, snapping the Spurs' six-game winning streak. Charlotte was the first team to score seven points or fewer in the opening quarter and come back to win since 2008. It was also the largest comeback surrendered by the Spurs in the Tim Duncan era, which began in 1997. Lin was 11-of-18 from the field and hit all four three-point attempts, including three in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter,</b> <b>and</b> provided the go-ahead jumper with 48 seconds left.

5|$|On {{the opening}} drive {{of the third}} quarter, Bowling Green's punter fumbled the ball and it flew {{into the end zone}} for a safety, giving Michigan a 30–14 lead. After the safety, Forcier {{completed}} a 21-yard pass to Roy Roundtree, which led to a 2-yard pass from Forcier to John McColgan. On Bowling Green's next drive, Jonas Mouton intercepted a pass at the Bowling Green 46-yard line and returned it 9 yards to the 37. After a 14-yard pass from Forcier to Gallon, Vincent Smith scored on an 8-yard run to give Michigan a 44–14 lead. Bowling Green then drove 69 yards and scored on a 2-yard run by Jordan Hopgood. Michigan held Bowling Green scoreless in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>and</b> added three more touchdowns on runs of 1 yard by Vincent Smith, 5 yards by Fitzgerald Toussaint and 7 yards by Devin Gardner. Toussaint also had a 61-yard run in the fourth quarter to set up his touchdown.|$|E
5|$|One of Mickal's {{most notable}} games came in 1934 against the Mustangs of Southern Methodist. He threw two {{touchdown}} passes, {{the first one}} a 32-yarder {{to tie the game}} at 7–7 in the second quarter. Late in <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>and</b> down by a touchdown, Mickal dropped back at his own 35-yard line and hurled a pass {{down the middle of the}} field. It was caught in stride at the Mustang 20-yard line by Gaynell Tinsley, who ran it into the end zone to tie the game at 14–14, which was the final score. In week four against 13th-ranked Arkansas, Mickal completed five of seven passes for 117 yards, which included a 52-yard bomb in the third quarter for the first score of the 16–0 win. He also averaged over 50 yards per punt on nine punts. The next week he threw a touchdown pass, kicked a field goal, and averaged over 40 yards per punt in a 29–0 win over previously undefeated Vanderbilt. Mickal was named a first-team All-SEC selection as a fullback by the Associated Press (AP) and as a halfback by the UP.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers almost {{exceeded}} their worst-ever loss, a 42–0 {{loss to the}} Pittsburgh Steelers, on its 10th anniversary. They {{were shut}} out until <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter,</b> <b>and</b> only scored when Chicago Bears safety Todd Bell intercepted a Steve Young pass and lateraled it to Mike Richardson, who attempted to lateral it to Shaun Gayle, only to have Tampa Bay receiver Vince Heflin intercept the lateral and run it in for a score. Mike Tomczak ran for the Bears' first score. Later, a Walter Payton touchdown was called back on a holding penalty. The Buccaneers stopped the Bears on fourth-and-1, but an offside penalty on Craig Swoope gave the Bears another chance. Tomczak fumbled, however, causing him to be benched in favor of Doug Flutie. Flutie scored two touchdowns, one passing and one running, before Tomczak returned in the second half. Tampa Bay scored a second time on Young's 14-yard pass to Calvin Magee, but Lew Barnes returned the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown. Magee's 143 receiving yards remain (as of 2009) the Buccaneers' single-game record for a tight end.|$|E
