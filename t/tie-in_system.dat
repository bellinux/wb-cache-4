40|$|Subsea Tie-in Systems is used {{to connect}} pipes between subsea {{structures}} in the offshore oil and gas industry. Subsea <b>Tie-in</b> <b>system</b> has been developed for many decades by the industry, and is used throughout the world in many subsea oil and gas fields of today. Industry experience and various piping codes have been developed and used in the design over the years. However {{there has been a}} lack of recommended standard practice and guideline for designing such systems. In this thesis two computer software analysis packages commonly used in the industry for structural analysis of piping systems is explored and compared. A vertical spool design case is investigated by the use of finite element analysis. Relevant design load cases are identified and a design basis is established for the analysis. Relevant piping codes such as ASME and DNV are used in the design. Some of the main challenges which have a great influence on rigid spool design are the fabrication tolerances and metrology, which has to be accounted for in the design. This thesis gives proposal on how to implement statistical distribution of tolerances in the analysis by use of design exploration tools included in the ANSYS Software package. Advantages and disadvantages are described. The thesis will present some theory and examples to gain a general understanding about the content to be presented. An Introduction of the most common Tie-in Systems and their basic configurations and shape is presented. Advantages and limitations are described. Recommendations and suggestions for future spool design solutions and load mitigations are given. In this thesis a vertical spool has been analysed with a statistical and probabilistic approach for the metrology and tolerances, the results shows that it is beneficial to include such method in order to better document the safety level and the conservatism in the spool design. The approach also allows the engineer to make a better decision towards the optimisation process of the spool. The thesis also shows that simple mitigation measures for a vertical spool such as pre-bending and introduction of a seabed support and buoyancy onto the spool has positive effects by reducing the resulting bending moments at connector ends, and can reduce the total stresses in the spool. The results also show that the vertical spool design is is very sensitive to VIV and hence fatigue capacity governs the design. The vertical spool design has also been checked by use of the commercial piping software package AutoPIPE from Bentley. The results compared to the ANSYS analysis shows that there is a minimal difference in utilisations when using pipe beam element technology. The software is found to be feasible for usage in subsea spool design for small to moderate displacements and deformations, however for an optimised weight design it is recommended to perform a FEA with solid element models in ANSYS...|$|E
40|$|The {{frequency}} of emergency incidents and the expanding spectrum {{of all possible}} mass casualties require preventive and safety precautions and fast professional respond to their occurrence. Emergency prevailing medical complication requests from Medical Rescue Service providers a different attendance to intervention than is usually requested in their daily routine activities. Daily routines of Medical Rescue Service providers include medical treatments {{of one or two}} patients using urgent care medicine methods, which present a full medical treatment to a particular patient from the first contact to their handing over to other medical services providers. In emergencies with mass casualties? incidence, it is impossible to attend one particular patient at a time, but it is necessary to adjust priorities in medical attendance to patients in dispatch and as well to transfer all patients to other medical service provider facilities. Shall there be an emergency with mass casualties, there are few concomitant circumstances in their solving, and these are: lack of time for decision making and rescue works co-ordination, panic, delay in treatment and transport of patients to other medical facilities. Especially at the rescue work start of all integrated rescue system units, forces and equipments are insufficient, as for example lack of professional medical staff, rescuer and medical equipment including medicaments. The ration of rescue forces and medical equipment to a number of patients optimizes in following process, when a successful outcome is conditioned by the rescue work in the first thirty to sixty minutes. It is, thus, very important to paying attention to the organization and control of rescue works of all integrated rescue units right from the start. An intergrated rescue system is mentioned in theoretical part of the thesis. On the strenght of valid legislation, the provider of Medical Rescue Service is generally described, particularly focused on preparedness and solving of emergency incidents by the Medical Rescue Service of South Bohemia. Furthermore, the organisation trauma plan,the START asset classification of casualties with the follow-up method using identification and sorting cards (medical classification) are described. The theoretical part of thesis is closed up by an outlined exterior emergency plan of the nuclear power plant Temelin with focus on its trauma plan related to the Medical Rescue Service of South Bohemia activities solving emergency situation in the connection with an outflow of radioactive substance. The thesis was written on the ground of a qualitative research using the method of a semi-led interview of seven superintendant medical doctors of Medical Rescue Service from different areas in South Bohemia. The content of the research was an evaluation of possible development and potentional changes in preparing and also consequential activities of medical units at emergency situations with mass casulties. Research questionaire was focused on competence and funcion of medical dispatching centre, establishing work process of first paramedics attending at the place of an emergency situation, also co-operation of medical units with other units of an integrated rescue system and as well the <b>tie-in</b> <b>system</b> to other medical facilities. The aim of the research was establishing hypotheses in terms of Medical Rescue Service of South Bohemia preparadness to solution of emergency situations. Created hypotheses attached to a chapter ¨Discussion¨ may be verified, in the future, by a quantitative research. Other thesis aims are included in attachment part. It represents an interpretation of tactical and testing practise of Medical Rescue Service of South Bohemia from 2006 to 2012 and topics focused on emergency incidents and mapping incidence and solution of emergency incidents with mass casualties in South Bohemia region from 2003 to 2012...|$|E

30|$|The {{depletion}} of onshore oil-gas resource makes more {{attention paid to}} offshore oil-gas exploitation, particularly {{to the development of}} subsea resources [1]. In recent years, more and more devices, such as pipelines, riser systems, subsea trees, manifolds, <b>tie-in</b> <b>systems,</b> have been applied to the seabed [2]. Pipelines on the seabed tend to be damaged by unexpected artificial and natural interferences caused by fishing nets, anchors, wave oscillations, and other seabed features and seism [3]. Once pipelines are damaged, a series of problems will be produced, which has negative effects on society, economy, and environment [4]. Therefore, how to connect pipelines reliably as well as related equipment in setting up a subsea oil-gas production system and pipeline repair is a big challenge. Because of the restricted operating environment in the deep sea, non-weld connection is the best choice to connect the subsea pipeline.|$|R

40|$|Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) {{principles}} {{have considerable}} promise {{to change the}} game of lifecycle cost of engineering systems at high safety levels by providing a reliable estimate of future system states. This estimate is a key for planning and decision making in an operational setting. While technology solutions have made considerable advances, the <b>tie-in</b> into the <b>systems</b> engineering process is lagging behind, which delays fielding of PHM-enabled systems. The derivation of specifications from high level requirements for algorithm performance to ensure quality predictions is not well developed. From an engineering perspective some key parameters driving the requirements for prognostics performance include: (1) maximum allowable Probability of Failure (PoF) of the prognostic system to bound {{the risk of losing}} an asset, (2) tolerable limits on proactive maintenance to minimize missed opportunity of asset usage, (3) lead time to specify the amount of advanced warning needed for actionable decisions, and (4) required confidence to specify when prognosis is sufficiently good to be used. This paper takes a systems engineering view towards the requirements specification process and presents a method for the flowdown process. A case study based on an electric Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (e-UAV) scenario demonstrates how top level requirements for performance, cost, and safety flow down to the health management level and specify quantitative requirements for prognostic algorithm performance...|$|R
