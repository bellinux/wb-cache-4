50|$|From {{the graph}} and the data, {{it is clear}} that the lines are not parallel, {{indicating}} that there is an interaction. This can be tested using analysis of variance (<b>ANOVA).</b> <b>The</b> first <b>ANOVA</b> model will not include the interaction term. That is, <b>the</b> first <b>ANOVA</b> model ignores possible interaction. <b>The</b> second <b>ANOVA</b> model will include the interaction term.

40|$|The paper briefly {{discusses}} the balanced incomplete–block design (BIBD’s) and further compares two methods of analyzing them-the classical and vector space {{analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) methods. These methods are applied differently to the data arising from the balanced incomplete block designs (BIBD’s). The basic interest is to compare {{the performance of the}} two methods of analysis on the available data from National Root Crop Research Institute (N. R. C. R. I) Umudike, Abia State. To achieve this, we shall consider treatment (adjusted), block (adjusted) treatment (not adjusted) in <b>the</b> classical <b>ANOVA</b> method and <b>the</b> vector space <b>ANOVA</b> method.   Block is adjusted to know if the experiment is symmetric balanced incomplete block design (SBIBD). <b>The</b> classical <b>ANOVA</b> method was easier to compute and more convenient to handle than <b>the</b> vector <b>ANOVA</b> method. <b>The</b> classical <b>ANOVA</b> method is found to be preferable to <b>the</b> vector space <b>ANOVA</b> method. </p...|$|R

50|$|In statistics, {{the two-way}} {{analysis}} of variance (ANOVA) {{is an extension of}} <b>the</b> one-way <b>ANOVA</b> that examines <b>the</b> influence of two different categorical independent variables on one continuous dependent variable. <b>The</b> two-way <b>ANOVA</b> not only aims at assessing the main effect of each independent variable but also if there is any interaction between them.|$|R
30|$|Unlike these studies, another {{simple method}} for one-way ANOVA, as a {{meaningful}} extension on <b>the</b> classical <b>ANOVA,</b> {{is presented in}} this paper where the observations are symmetric triangular or normal fuzzy numbers. <b>The</b> proposed <b>ANOVA</b> method is {{on the basis of a}} distance between symmetric fuzzy numbers which is easy to be used by professional clients.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>ANOVAs</b> mentioned above, a {{multiple regression analysis}} (Leona et al. 1996) was performed to estimate how stand, site and economic conditions, as well as silvicultural planning, influence forest profitability, measured as SEV.

50|$|Because it is a {{two-dimensional}} representation of multiple dimensions (one for each factor in <b>the</b> <b>ANOVA),</b> the multi-vari chart is only useful for comparing the variability among at most four factors.|$|E
30|$|A {{generalised}} {{linear model}} was not needed {{for any of}} <b>the</b> <b>ANOVAs</b> because microsites were not paired.

40|$|Some recent {{developments}} for <b>the</b> Shine-Bower single-subject <b>ANOVA</b> and <b>the</b> Shine Combined <b>ANOVA</b> are integrated {{in order to}} remove the restriction of an even number of trials for <b>the</b> Shine Combined <b>ANOVA.</b> SHINE (1977 b) has recently removed the restriction of an even num-ber of trials for <b>the</b> Shine-Bower single-subject <b>ANOVA.</b> This is done by basing the Shine-Bower error term on any subset or set of subsets of successive trials from the overall complete set of trials, {{rather than on the}} overall complete set of trials itself, where each subset is chosen on an a priori basis and has an even number of trials, This new procedure does not require an even overall number of trials and also allows the experimenter considerable flexibility to design the Shine-Bower error term (on an a priori basis) to fit the needs of his own experimentation. Shine (1977 a) has also recently presented a new procedure for getting around the independence and distributional problems of the original F test for the trial-by-subject interaction in <b>the</b> Shine Combined <b>ANOVA.</b> <b>The</b> purpose of the present paper is {{to make use of the}} above {{recent developments}} in order to remove the restriction of an even number of trials for <b>the</b> Shine Combined <b>ANOVA.</b> Since <b>the</b> tests for subject effects in <b>the</b> Shine Combined <b>ANOVA</b> are <b>the</b> only ones in that design which are based on the Shine-Bower error term, only those tests need consideration in the present paper.

50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>ANOVA</b> {{model that}} ignores interaction, neither {{temperature}} nor time {{has a significant}} effect on yield (p=0.91), which is clearly the incorrect conclusion. The more appropriate ANOVA model should test for possible interaction.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ANOVA</b> F-test {{is known}} to be nearly optimal in the sense of {{minimizing}} false negative errors for a fixed rate of false positive errors (i.e. maximizing power for a fixed significance level). For example, to test the hypothesis that various medical treatments have exactly the same effect, the F-test's p-values closely approximate the permutation test's p-values: The approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced. Such permutation tests characterize tests with maximum power against all alternative hypotheses, as observed by Rosenbaum. <b>The</b> <b>ANOVA</b> F-test (of the null-hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect) is recommended as a practical test, because of its robustness against many alternative distributions.|$|E
