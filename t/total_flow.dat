5|$|Some {{reaches of}} Keyser Creek {{experience}} <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> loss {{and there is}} no regular flow in the watershed's lower reaches. There are also extensive piles of culm and silts piled up in the creek's floodplain, left over from the coal mining era. There is at least one sanitary sewer overflow in the watershed. As of 2013, there are an estimated four stormwater detention facilities in the watershed. The creek has no perennial flow, since it loses flow to mine pools during dry weather. For this reason, it is unlikely to attain its designated uses. However, it still has flow during storms. During storm flows, the creek carries large amounts of sediment containing coal waste. Additionally, there are some discharges of rusty water into the creek, in addition to a combined sewer overflow.|$|E
5|$|The Trinity River is a {{predominantly}} rain-fed river, {{with the highest}} flows occurring between December and April and the lowest from August through October. The water level can rise quickly in the winter when large Pacific storms strike California's north coast. Almost no precipitation occurs in summer, when {{the primary source of}} flow is snowmelt from the higher elevations of the Klamath Mountains and groundwater base flow. In addition, diversion of water to the Central Valley has greatly reduced the <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> of the river since the 1960s, though conversely, a required minimum dam release for protection of migrating salmon results in a flow rate during the dry season that is higher than it naturally would be.|$|E

Once again, it can be observed that each region’s ratio has remained stable across both periods of analysis.|$|R

25|$|The topography, geology {{and land}} use of the Trent catchment, all have a direct {{influence}} on the hydrology of the river. The variation in these factors is also reflected in the contrasting runoff characteristics and subsequent inflows of the principal tributaries. The largest {{of these is the}} River Tame, which contributes nearly a quarter of the <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> for the Trent, with the other significant tributaries being the Derwent at 18%, Soar 17%, the Dove 13%, and the Sow 8%. Four of these main tributaries, including the Dove and Derwent which drain the upland Peak District, all join within the middle reaches, giving rise to a comparatively energetic river system for the UK.|$|E
25|$|The {{first steps}} of RNA-seq also include similar image processing, however, {{conversion}} of images to sequence data is typically handled automatically by the instrument software.

In Roche’s pyrosequencing method, the intensity of emitted light determines the number of consecutive nucleotides in a homopolymer repeat. There are many variants on these methods, each with a different error profile for the resulting data.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{inside the}} first stage can be of the diaphragm type or the piston type. Both types can be balanced or unbalanced. Unbalanced regulators have the cylinder pressure pushing {{the first stage}} upstream valve closed, which is opposed by the intermediate stage pressure and a spring. As cylinder pressure falls the closing force is less, so the regulated pressure increases at lower tank pressure. To keep this pressure rise within acceptable limits the high-pressure orifice size is limited, but this decreases the <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> capacity of the regulator. A balanced regulator keeps about the same ease of breathing at all depths and pressures, by using the cylinder pressure to also indirectly oppose {{the opening of the}} first stage valve.|$|E

25|$|Angiogenesis is {{generally}} associated with aerobic exercise and endurance exercise. While arteriogenesis produces network changes {{that allow for}} a large increase {{in the amount of}} <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> in a network, angiogenesis causes changes that allow for greater nutrient delivery {{over a long period of}} time. Capillaries are designed to provide maximum nutrient delivery efficiency, so an increase in the number of capillaries allows the network to deliver more nutrients in the same amount of time. A greater number of capillaries also allows for greater oxygen exchange in the network. This is vitally important to endurance training, because it allows a person to continue training for an extended period of time. However, no experimental evidence suggests that increased capillarity is required in endurance exercise to increase the maximum oxygen delivery.|$|E
25|$|Picture {{a series}} of water pipes, fitting into a network. Each pipe is of a certain diameter, so it can only {{maintain}} a flow of {{a certain amount of}} water. Anywhere that pipes meet, the total amount of water coming into that junction must be equal to the amount going out, otherwise we would quickly run out of water, or we would have a buildup of water. We have a water inlet, which is the source, and an outlet, the sink. A flow would then be one possible way for water to get from source to sink so that the total amount of water coming out of the outlet is consistent. Intuitively, the <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> of a network is the rate at which water comes out of the outlet.|$|E
25|$|Side-Stream Filtration — Side-stream filtration, {{although}} {{popular and}} effective, {{does not provide}} complete protection. With side-stream filtration, {{a portion of the}} water is filtered continuously. This method works on the principle that continuous particle removal will keep the system clean. Manufacturers typically package side-stream filters on a skid, complete with a pump and controls. For high flow systems, this method is cost-effective. Properly sizing a side-stream filtration system is critical to obtain satisfactory filter performance, but there is some debate over how to properly size the side-stream system. Many engineers size the system to continuously filter the cooling tower basin water at a rate equivalent to 10% of the total circulation flow rate. For example, if the <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> of a system is 1,200 gal/min (a 400-ton system), a 120 gal/min side-stream system is specified.|$|E

The <b>total</b> power <b>flow</b> from the X-Y motion stage (the vibrating machinery) to the equipment table (the floating elastic panel) through multiple resilient mounts and the contribution of each force component at mounting junctions to the <b>total</b> power <b>flow</b> were analysed in the concerned frequency range for different types of excitations.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{influence}} of <b>total</b> gas <b>flow</b> on solar cell performance and deposition rate of microcrystalline silicon solar cells prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition at 13. 56 -MHz excitation frequency. By changing the <b>total</b> gas <b>flow</b> the transition between amorphous and microcrystalline growth can be systematically varied. Over {{a wide range of}} <b>total</b> gas <b>flows,</b> solar cell efficiencies between 7 and 9 % could be realized. The cells at low <b>total</b> gas <b>flows</b> were prepared at increased silane concentrations and reduced hydrogen flows. The results are interpreted in terms of gas utilization and gas residence time in the plasma space. Furthermore, a new technique for the deposition of pc-Si:H is described which produces muc-Si:H suitable for high efficiency solar cells with only very low hydrogen supply. The best solar cell prepared by this method had an efficiency of 7. 3 %. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The PECVD of in situ boron doped SiGe and Ge layers {{with the}} {{increased}} <b>total</b> gas <b>flow</b> was investigated. It was found, that the SiGe layer could be deposited as amorphous or polycrystalline material depending on the quantity of the <b>total</b> gas <b>flow,</b> while other deposition parameters were kept constant. The increased <b>total</b> gas <b>flow</b> favors the crystallization of the deposited SiGe or Ge layers, what is attributed to the reduced gas residence time. The reduced residence time improves the crystallinity of the deposited layers by increasing the Ge content in the layers (in the case of SiGe layers) and probably additionally through the increasing of the XH 3 radicals in the plasma. With the deposition method with increased <b>total</b> gas <b>flow,</b> poly-SiGe and poly-Ge layers with very low resistivity (about 1 mOmega-cm) can be deposited at very low substrate temperatures (poly-SiGe: <= 375 C; poly-Ge: <= 340 C).
