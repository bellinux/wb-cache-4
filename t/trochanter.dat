5|$|The ilium of {{the pelvis}} had a convex upper border, a low postacetabular blade (behind the acetabulum), and a narrow brevis-shelf (a {{projection}} where tail muscles attached). The pubic foot was pronounced and shorter {{at the front}} than behind. The ischium was straight and expanded hindwards, ending in a lobe-shape. The femur was sigmoid-shaped, and had a very robust, upwards pointing head, with a deep sulcus (groove). The lesser <b>trochanter</b> of the femoral head was wing-like, and placed below the greater <b>trochanter,</b> which was short. The fourth <b>trochanter</b> was large and projected backwards. The tibia of the lower leg was expanded at the upper end, its articular facet (where it articulated with the femur) was wide, and its shaft was compressed from front to back.|$|E
5|$|The thighbone is {{straight}} in front view. Seen {{from the same}} direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20° to the front. The greater <b>trochanter</b> is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser <b>trochanter</b> in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser <b>trochanter</b> a low accessory <b>trochanter</b> is present. At {{the lower end of}} the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.|$|E
5|$|The thorax bears {{three pairs}} of legs, one pair on each segment. The {{prothorax}} (T1) has a functional spiracle which is actually derived from the mesothorax (T2) while the metathorax has a reduced spiracle which is not externally open and lies beneath the cuticle. The thoracic legs consist of coxa, <b>trochanter,</b> femur, tarsus and claw and are constant in form throughout the order. However they are reduced {{in the case of}} certain leaf-miners and elongated in certain Notodontidae. In Micropterigidae, the legs are three-segmented, as the coxa, <b>trochanter</b> and femur are fused.|$|E
50|$|The upper or {{proximal}} extremity (close to the torso) {{contains the}} head, neck, the two <b>trochanters</b> and adjacent structures.|$|R

5|$|The hindlimbs of Patagosaurus {{are based}} on scant material, some femora, a tibia, and a few nondescript pedal bones. Two femora come from an adult, with a single {{additional}} bone known from the juvenile. The adult femora are proportionately different from the juvenile, being mostly straighter and more ovoid in cross-section. The femoral head is well preserved, although lacking the greater <b>trochanter.</b> The distal end is rather symmetrical when viewed from behind, with two similarly sized condylar surfaces. In the juvenile, the fourth <b>trochanter</b> is completely in the proximal end. The tibia has a well-developed cnemial crest, and is also short and robust. The surface that would have articulated with the astragalus in life has the anterior half raised, and the posterior half lowered.|$|E
5|$|Mantises {{have two}} spiked, {{grasping}} forelegs ("raptorial legs") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, including the posterior four {{legs of a}} mantis, the coxa and <b>trochanter</b> combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and <b>trochanter</b> combine to form a segment {{about as long as}} the femur, which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration). Located {{at the base of the}} femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the mantis its grasp on its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage, made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no arolium.|$|E
5|$|Nesbitt found {{a number}} of further {{potential}} synapomorphies, and discounted {{a number of}} synapomorphies previously suggested. Some of these are also present in silesaurids, which Nesbitt recovered as a sister group to Dinosauria, including a large anterior <b>trochanter,</b> metatarsals II and IV of subequal length, reduced contact between ischium and pubis, {{the presence of a}} cnemial crest on the tibia and of an ascending process on the astragalus, and many others.|$|E

5|$|The scapula {{was short}} with a {{moderately}} expanded upper end. The coracoid was circular in side view. The {{elements of the}} forelimb were generally moderately long, straight and stout. The hand is only known from recent discoveries and {{has not yet been}} described. In the rather wide pelvis, the ilium was straight in side view. Its front blade was rod-shaped and moderately splayed to the outside, creating room for the belly. This was reinforced by the sacral ribs becoming longer towards the front. The sacral ribs were wider at their attachment areas with the ilium, but were not fused into a sacral yoke. The pubis featured a short prepubis. The pubis shaft was straight, running parallel to a straight ischium shaft that was transversely flattened at its lower end. The thighbone was straight in side view, in front view it was somewhat bowed to the outside. Its head was not separated from the shaft by a real neck. While the major <b>trochanter</b> was at about the same level as the head, the lower minor <b>trochanter</b> was separated from both by a deep cleft. At it rear side, the femur mid-shaft featured a well-developed drooping fourth <b>trochanter,</b> a process for the attachment of the retractor tail muscle, the Musculus caudofemoralis longus. The lower leg was somewhat shorter than the thighbone. The tibia had a wide upper end, with a cnemial crest protruding well to the front. The tibia lower end was also robust and rotated about 70° compared to the upper part, turning the foot strongly to the outside. The foot was very large and wide. The fifth metatarsal was only rudimentary but the other four were robust. Scelidosaurus had four large toes, with the innermost digit being the smallest. The fourth metatarsal was short but its toe was long and built to be splayed to the outside of the foot, to improve the stability. The claws were flat, hoof-shaped and curved to the inside.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the eight}} legs of a spider {{consists}} of seven distinct parts. The part closest to and attaching the leg to the cephalothorax is the coxa; the next segment is the short <b>trochanter</b> that works as a hinge for the following long segment, the femur; next is the spider's knee, the patella, which acts as the hinge for the tibia; the metatarsus is next, and it connects the tibia to the tarsus (which may {{be thought of as}} a foot of sorts); the tarsus ends in a claw made up of either two or three points, depending on the family to which the spider belongs. Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, spiders and a few other groups still use hydraulic pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. The only extensor muscles in spider legs are located in the three hip joints (bordering the coxa and the <b>trochanter).</b> As a result, a spider with a punctured cephalothorax cannot extend its legs, and the legs of dead spiders curl up. Spiders can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level to extend their legs, and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 times their own length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs. Although larger spiders use hydraulics to straighten their legs, unlike smaller jumping spiders they depend on their flexor muscles to generate the propulsive force for their jumps.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{features}} found in sauropods that basal sauropodomorphs lack {{are related to the}} change in body size. The greatest regions affected by this are the hind limbs and pelvis. For example, an elongating of the ilium, size reduction of the lesser <b>trochanter</b> shelf, and semiplantigrade posture are some features that indicate the amount and positioning of leg muscles being modified. Vulcanodon possessed these features, the latter of which is seen earliest in it. However, Vulcanodon does not have reduced distal phalanges, which are seen in Shunosaurus and all more derived sauropods. This means that while the muscle positioning of its legs were changing, they had not yet reduced in the distal region of the limb.|$|E
5000|$|Both sexes {{have black}} cephalothoraxes and abdomens, with the urticating hair patch golden. The coxae, <b>trochanters</b> and femurs are also black, but the patellae, tibiae, metatarsi, and tarsi are reddish light brown.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Description== These spiders {{are thin}} and green, {{commonly}} {{found on the}} undersides of leaves. They {{can be found in}} parts of Sumatra, Java, and northern Queensland. The legs are long and thin. There is a small window before the coxa, and the <b>trochanters</b> do not have any notches. A round depression is in the place of the thoracic groove. In males, the chelicerae are longer and projected. Spiders of this genus can be distinguished from other spiders of the family by the absence notches in the <b>trochanters,</b> the absence of a cymbial spur in males, and the absence of an epigynal window in females.|$|R

5|$|The non-reproductive castes of {{termites}} are wingless {{and rely}} exclusively on their six legs for locomotion. The alates fly {{only for a}} brief amount of time, so they also rely on their legs. The appearance of the legs is similar in each caste, but the soldiers have larger and heavier legs. The structure of the legs is consistent with other insects: the parts of a leg include a coxa, <b>trochanter,</b> femur, tibia and the tarsus. The number of tibial spurs on an individual's leg varies. Some species of termite have an arolium, located between the claws, which is present in species that climb on smooth surfaces but is absent in most termites.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{have one}} pair of fore wings on the {{mesothorax}} {{and a pair of}} halteres, or reduced hind wings, on the metathorax. A further adaptation for flight is the reduction in number of the neural ganglia, and concentration of nerve tissue in the thorax, a feature that is most extreme in the highly derived Muscomorpha infraorder. Some species of flies are exceptional in that they are secondarily flightless. The only other order of insects bearing a single pair of true, functional wings, in addition to any form of halteres, are the Strepsiptera. In contrast to the flies, the Strepsiptera bear their halteres on the mesothorax and their flight wings on the metathorax. Each of the fly's six legs has a typical insect structure of coxa, <b>trochanter,</b> femur, tibia and tarsus, with the tarsus in most instances being subdivided into five tarsomeres. At the tip of the limb is a pair of claws, and between these are cushion-like structures known as pulvilli which provide adhesion.|$|E
5|$|To {{support the}} lambeosaurine affinities of Eolambia, Kirkland {{conducted}} a phylogenetic analysis; the tree recovered by his analysis, which accordingly places Eolambia {{as the most}} basal lambeosaurine, is reproduced below. Despite the evidence he cited {{in support of this}} position, Kirkland also noted a seemingly inconsistent trait. As observed in the juvenile ilium he initially described, the antitrochanter – a projection on the ilium that limits the greater <b>trochanter</b> of the femur – is more poorly developed than would be expected for a basal hadrosaurid. Michael Brett-Surman noted that adults may have had a better-developed antitrochanter. On the other hand, the derived lambeosaurine Hypacrosaurus has a well-developed antitrochanter even at the hatchling stage. Kirkland noted the possibility that basal hadrosaurids developed their antitrochanter later in life than derived hadrosaurids such as Hypacrosaurus. He thus remarked that adult Eolambia specimens would resolve this issue.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{estimated}} femoral neck angle (120-130 degrees) of aforementioned remains, the femur {{is similar}} to that of a quadrupedal anthropoid. The greater <b>trochanter’s</b> morphology is inconsistent with that of leaping primates, serving as further evidence of the animal’s quadrupedalism.|$|R

5|$|The innominate {{is known}} from seven examples, {{but most are}} quite incomplete. It {{includes}} a narrow ilium and long ischium. The ischial tuberosity, a narrow rough piece of bone in most placentals, is broad and smooth in Plesiorycteropus. With 17 specimens, the femur is the best represented long bone. It is distinctive in its long neck, similar only to the gymnure Echinosorex according to MacPhee. A projection known as the third <b>trochanter</b> is larger in P.madagascariensis. The tibia and fibula are extensively fused into a tibiofibula, of which eight examples are known. This bone resembles that of armadillos in the extensive fusion, the compression of the shaft of the tibia, the narrowness of the articulation surface at the distal end, and the broad space between the bones. Unlike in armadillos, the tibia and fibula are not inclined relative to each other, but about parallel. The astragalus, which is known from four examples, is wide and short and contains a uniquely large posteromedial process. Seven metapodials (middle hand or foot bones) are known, rather variable in size, but MacPhee was unable to separate metacarpals (from the hand) and metatarsals (from the foot). All are rather short and are broad proximally and narrow distally. Among the few known phalanges, the proximal phalange is shorter than the middle one and the distal phalanges are narrow and clawlike.|$|E
25|$|Of the hindlimb, {{the lower}} leg is missing. The femur or thigh bone is {{straight}} and robust. The lesser <b>trochanter</b> is markedly {{lower than the}} greater <b>trochanter</b> and separated from it by a narrow cleft. It has {{the shape of a}} wing-like expansion to the front. An accessory or posterior <b>trochanter</b> is lacking; likewise a fourth <b>trochanter</b> on the back shaft is absent. The tibia has only a weak cnemial crest, separated from its outer condyle by a deep narrow groove, the incisura tibialis. The fibula is broad on top but has a slender shaft.|$|E
25|$|On the femur, {{the lesser}} <b>trochanter</b> extends {{below the level}} of the femoral head, unlike Yunnanosaurus and Jingshanosaurus. Viewed from the front, the <b>trochanter</b> is close to the midline of the bone, like other basal sauropodomorphs except for Antetonitrus and Melanorosaurus (in which it is closer to the outer edge). Similarly, the fourth <b>trochanter</b> is near the midline, in {{contrast}} to many basal sauropodomorphs, including Lufengosaurus. Of the two processes {{on the bottom of the}} tibia, the one in the back is thinner, and projects more outwards than downwards than the one in front; this differs from most other sauropodomorphs in which the two are equally thick, and either they project equally outwards (as in Lufengosaurus and Jingshanosaurus) or the front one projects further outwards (as in Yunnanosaurus).|$|E

25|$|Displaced {{fractures}} of the <b>trochanter</b> or femoral neck will typically cause external {{rotation and}} shortening {{of the leg}} when the patient is laying supine.|$|E
25|$|Post-cranial {{characteristics}} include reduced relative {{size of the}} pubic peduncle of the ilium and {{a fourth}} <b>trochanter</b> that is shifted distally on the shaft of the femur. The pubic peduncle of the ilium is an anterior extension of the ilium, which joins with the pubis. In Genasauria, the relative size of the public peduncle, compared {{to the size of}} the ilium, is reduced. The fourth <b>trochanter</b> is a process (extension) of the femur that serves as an attachment point for tail muscles, mainly for attachment of the Musculus caudofemoralis longus.|$|E
25|$|The {{anterior}} dorsal hip {{muscles are}} the iliopsoas, {{a group of}} two or three muscles with a shared insertion on the lesser <b>trochanter</b> of the femur. The psoas major originates from the last vertebra and along the lumbar spine to stretch down into the pelvis. The iliacus originates on the iliac fossa on the interior side of the pelvis. The two muscles unite to form the iliopsoas muscle which is inserted on the lesser <b>trochanter</b> of the femur. The psoas minor, only present in about 50 per cent of subjects, originates above psoas major to stretch obliquely down to its insertion on the interior side of the major muscle.|$|E

50|$|It is {{directed}} lateral and medially and slightly posterior. In the adult {{it is about}} 1 cm lower than the head. Because the pelvic outlet in the female is larger than in the male, {{there is a greater}} distance between the greater <b>trochanters</b> in the female.|$|R
