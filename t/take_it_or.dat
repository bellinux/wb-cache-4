As well as lead vocals Gauci also provided piano; on the EP she was backed by Simon Burke on Hammond organ and Rhodes keyboard, John Castle on bass guitar and producer, Michael Carmona on percussion, Cory Jach on lead guitar, Barney Loveland on bass guitar and Haydn Meggitt on drums. It had been recorded at Castle's home studio, The Shed, in Camberwell.|$|E

They played soul, pop, and jazz at local pubs, clubs, weddings, and corporate functions. Gauci uploaded work from <b>Take</b> <b>It</b> <b>or</b> Leave It {{to the national}} radio station, Triple J's website, and was subsequently chosen for the Unearthed talent competition and gained radio airplay and coverage. To help fund her work, Gauci worked as a vocals teacher at the Academy of Mary Immaculate, Fitzroy; and Assumption College, Kilmore.|$|E

25|$|Oath-helping {{involved}} the party undergoing proof swearing {{to the truth}} of his claim or denial and having that oath reinforced by five or more others, chosen either by the party or by the court. The numbers of helpers required and the form of their oath differed from place to place and upon the nature of the dispute. If either the party or any of the helpers failed in the oath, either refusing to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> sometimes even making an error in the required formula, the proof failed and the case was adjudged to the other side. It appears surprising to moderns that so important a matter might be settled by one and his friends falsely swearing an oath. In a society in which each was known to his neighbour and in which religious emphasis was placed upon the sanctity of an oath, the system was probably more satisfactory. As 'wager of law' it remained a way of determining cases in the common law until its abolition in the 19th century.|$|E
500|$|Controversy ensued {{when the}} Soviets wanted {{to back out}} of the refereeing agreement. The Soviets wanted to include the German pair of referees, {{originally}} scheduled for the game. Eagleson threatened to pull Team Canada from playing the eighth game. In a compromise, Kompalla refereed along with Bata instead of Baader. The ill will spilled over into the presentation of a totem pole as a gift from Team Canada. The pre-game presentation was cancelled by the Soviets, but restored on the insistence of Team Canada. According to Coach Sinden, Eagleson stated that they [...] "were going to take this totem pole and bring it to centre ice and they'll have to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> skate around it the whole game." ...|$|E
500|$|Higginbotham entered Purdue as a {{freshman}} in 1944. At the time, the student body was composed of approximately 6,000 white students, and 12 black students. Although eligible for admission, black students were not permitted {{to live in the}} dormitories. Higginbotham and the other 11 black students were placed in a building called International House, which was the only building that blacks could live in West Lafayette. The students slept in the attic, which was unheated. Higginbotham sought a meeting with the University President, Edward C. Elliott, to ask permission for the students to sleep in a section of one of the heated dormitories. Elliott's response was purportedly [...] "he law doesn't require us to put you in those dormitories. The law doesn't even require us to let you in. You <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> leave it." [...] Higginbotham would later identify this encounter, and an incident where he was traveling with the Purdue debate team, but unable to stay in a hotel {{with the rest of the}} members, as the events that caused him to pursue a career in the law, saying: ...|$|E

Israel attempted to mount a counter-proposal in May 2007 to work out those contentious issues. In May 2007, an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said that [...] "Israel {{has no interest in}} stagnation and unfortunately, if the Arab initiative is <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> leave it, that will be a recipe for stagnation". Progress stalled until Israel began a serious reconsideration of the offer in October 2008. As of January 2009, both sides have been unable to come to any agreement and the initiative seems dormant.|$|E

[...] While it was widely believed that emcee Phil Baker ad-libbed the popular game shows <b>Take</b> <b>It</b> <b>Or</b> Leave It and $64 Question, most of the shows were actually written by Block. An example of what [...] appears to be casual conversation, but was actually a joke written by Block, was for entertainer Kenny Murray to say to his television studio audience: [...] "I don't care whether you laugh at my jokes or not.

2500|$|In a {{positive}} review for Time, Richard Corliss called The Passion of the Christ [...] "a serious, handsome, excruciating film that radiates total commitment." [...] New York Press film critic Armond White praised Gibson's direction, comparing him to Carl Theodor Dreyer in how he transformed art into spirituality. Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times gave the movie {{four out of}} four stars, calling it [...] "the most violent film [...] ha ever seen" [...] as well as reflecting on how the film personally impacted him as a former altar boy saying [...] "What Gibson has provided for me, {{for the first time}} in my life, is a visceral idea of what the Passion consisted of. That his film is superficial in terms of the surrounding message -- that we get only a few passing references to the teachings of Jesus -- is, I suppose, not the point. This is not a sermon or a homily, but a visualization of the central event in the Christian religion. <b>Take</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> leave it." [...] In a negative review, Slate magazine's David Edelstein called it [...] "a two-hour-and-six-minute snuff movie", while Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News felt it was [...] "the most virulently anti-Semitic movie made since the German propaganda films of World War II". Writing for the Dallas Observer, Robert Wilonsky said he found the movie [...] "too turgid to awe the nonbelievers, too zealous to inspire and often too silly to take seriously, with its demonic hallucinations that look like escapees from a David Lynch film; I swear I couldn't find the devil carrying around a hairy-backed midget anywhere in the text I read." ...|$|E
