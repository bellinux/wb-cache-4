Los Angeles Lakers general manager Jerry West suggested that Duncan might become the top pick in the 1995 NBA draft if he went early, but Duncan assured everyone {{he had no intention of}} going pro until he graduated, even though the NBA was planning to add a rookie salary cap in 1996. He was giving up a lot of money, but was determined <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>school.</b> In that season, he led the Demon Deacons into the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship game against a Rasheed Wallace-led North Carolina Tar Heels. During that game, Duncan neutralized the threat of Wallace, while Childress sealed the win with a jump shot with four seconds left in overtime. In the NCAA Tournament, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16, and playing against Oklahoma State, Duncan scored 12 points to go with 22 rebounds and eight blocks, outplaying Bryant Reeves, but his team lost 71–66. Still, Duncan ended the year averaging 16.8 points and 12.5 rebounds per game, was named Defensive Player of the Year and became the third-best shot-blocker in NCAA history with 3.98 blocks per game.

By the time the United States entered the war in 1917, over 5000 Phis served in the conflict with 155 of them losing their lives. Because many of the undergraduate Phis put their studies on hold, many chapter houses either had limited occupants or none at all. To prevent losing houses pending the return of Phis from the war, many housing corporations consented to having the houses used as barracks or for YMCA programs.|$|E

Generally reviewers did not rate it as highly as its predecessor Vulture Street, with Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun HiT describing it as [...] "No radical reinvention, no huge change in direction ...

500|$|Michigan {{entered the}} game as the No. 5-ranked team in both the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll. Media outlets {{projected}} the team as favorites to win the Big Ten conference, and as contenders for a national championship. Michigan featured a strong senior class of offensive tackle Jake Long, tailback Mike Hart, and quarterback Chad Henne, each of whom had decided <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>school</b> rather than declare eligibility for the NFL Draft. The players attributed their decision to several factors, such as Michigan having lost their last three games to rival Ohio State and the Wolverines' streak of three consecutive bowl losses. The three also desired to finish their college careers on a high note. Mark Schlabach of ESPN.com stated that [...] ", along with receivers Mario Manningham and Adrian Arrington, gives Michigan what could potentially {{be one of the}} most explosive offenses in college football". Prior to the season, the team named Hart and Long as captains, along with linebacker Shawn Crable, a fifth-year senior. [...] Michigan aimed to open the game in a three-receiver formation, which has the potential to spread the opposing defense out; Michigan coach Lloyd Carr noted that [...] "when you have some of the skill that we have at the wide receiver positions and can spread a defense out, that's [...] positive." [...] At the same time, Michigan was anticipated to run only a limited selection of plays from this set, to limit the ability of their upcoming opponents to develop an effective game plan against them. Michigan's defense, which led the FBS in run defense in 2006, lost seven starters from the previous season, including four All-Americans (cornerback Leon Hall and defensive linemen Alan Branch, David Harris, and LaMarr Woodley), each of whom were drafted in the first two rounds of the 2007 NFL Draft. Wolverines linebacker Chris Graham, a senior, expected the defense to be defined by speed, noting that each position on the defense was [...] "loaded in speed".|$|E

This study aims to investigate the successes and continuing challenges in homeless student transportation services at the city-scale (Los Angeles County) in order to contribute to a national discourse on prevention of further hardship for a growing number of youth. Secondary data analysis describes the context of the issue, while surveys and interviews with school district employees reveal the solutions born of these factors and explore the dynamics of coordination and the actors involved. Public transportation is the most cited mode of transportation for children and youth to school. Frequent residential mobility and difficulty getting in touch with parents are the biggest challenges to transportation coordination. District Liaisons interact with multiple agencies in the coordination of transportation, through communication, collaboration and conducting outreach.
