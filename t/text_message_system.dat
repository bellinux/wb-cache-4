40|$|Background: There is no {{functional}} {{pharmacovigilance system}} in Cambodia to our knowledge. Mobile phone-based tools, such as {{short message service}} (SMS) text messages, are increasingly used for surveillance purposes. Objective: To pilot-test the FrontlineSMS mobile phone-based tool for notification of adverse events, using Cambodia's only International Vaccination Center at the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge as a field site. Methods: People receiving vaccinations, aged over 18 years, and who owned a cell phone were recruited in the study following informed consent. The names and mobile phone numbers of the participants interviewed were entered each day into the FrontlineSMS software. Two days after being vaccinated, participants received an automatically generated SMS text message asking whether any adverse events had occurred. Their SMS reply was number-coded and exported from the software daily to an Excel spreadsheet and examined before being saved. If the participant replied with a code for a severe adverse event (8 or 9), they were automatically advised to consult the nearest doctor. Results: The active surveillance study was conducted over 72 days {{in the spring of}} 2012. Patients agreed to be asked by SMS text message whether unwanted events had occurred after vaccination. Of 1331 persons aged over 18 years referred to the vaccination unit, 184 (13. 8 %) were asked and agreed to participate. When texted for clinical status 48 hours after vaccination, 52 (28. 3 %) participants did not reply, 101 (54. 9 %) sent an immediate SMS reply, and 31 (16. 8 %) sent an SMS reply after additional prompting. Of the initial 184 participants, 132 (71. 7 %) replied. These 132 participants received 135 vaccine doses and 109 (82. 6 %) reported no adverse events, whereas 23 (17. 4 %) reported adverse events, all benign. Conclusions: Notification using an SMS-based <b>text</b> <b>message</b> <b>system</b> is already used in Cambodia for syndromic surveillance in health centers and reporting by health care workers. Our results show that such tools can also be useful for notification by patients or health users in Cambodia, especially in an urban setting. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presents}} a multipart {{investigation of the}} benefits and challenges in deploying automated question-answering {{as an alternative to}} web-based searching to provide information about prostate cancer screening for low-income men age 40 years and older. Methods: The study comprised: 1) a survey assessing current use of the Internet, mobile phones and texting; 2) a controlled observational study of both web-based searching and automated question-answering for information about prostate cancer; and 3) a formative field study in which subjects interacted with a health department nurse using <b>text</b> <b>messages.</b> Results: Survey results suggest the target population has greater access to, and familiarity with, cell phones and <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> compared to the Internet and web-based searching. Participants were significantly more confident using a cell phone and preferred to get health information through <b>text</b> <b>messaging.</b> Participants in the controlled observational study accepted the <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> <b>system,</b> with most indicating it answered their questions, was easy to use and was a favorable tool for information-seeking. The field study also demonstrated potential for automated question-answering and <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> to help the target population access health information. Conclusions: A two-way <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> <b>system</b> has great potential to promote health communication and health information distribution.

40|$|Background: Text-messaging {{systems have}} been used to promote a range of health behaviors, {{including}} medication adherence among human immunodeficiency virus–positive individuals. However, little is currently known about the specific characteristics of <b>messaging</b> <b>systems</b> that promote user engagement. Objective: Using data from a randomized controlled trial involving a pager-based <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> <b>system,</b> this study sought to examine the overall usability of the system, user evaluation of the system, demographic and psychosocial correlates of usability, and its performance as an adherence assessment tool. Materials and Methods: The <b>messaging</b> <b>system</b> consisted of an alphanumeric pager capable of sending and receiving individualized <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> and the software necessary to program and track communication. The system was evaluated using behavioral outcomes (pager message response rate), self-report survey responses, focus group discussions, and data from electronic medication monitoring pill bottles. Results: Although the majority of participants reported that the system was effective in reminding them to take medication doses, the overall response rate to <b>system</b> <b>messages</b> was relatively low (42. 8 %) and dropped significantly {{over the course of the}} 3 -month intervention period. In addition, user engagement did not differ significantly by most demographic and psychosocial variables. Conclusions: The pager-based <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> <b>system</b> was received well by participants and appears to be applicable to a broad population; however, the system did not actively engage all participants over the course of the trial. Future research should determine whether systems customized to personal preference in notification style, frequency, and user device can increase use and provide further assistance to achieve optimal medication adherence...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{widespread}} and low cost of mobile phones and {{the convenience of}} short <b>message</b> service (SMS) <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> suggest potential suitability for use with alternative strategies for supporting retention in care and adherence {{to the treatment of}} various chronic diseases, such as HIV and tuberculosis (TB). Despite the growing body of literature reporting positive outcomes of SMS text message-based communication with patients, there is yet very little research about the integration of communication technologies and electronic medical records or electronic patient tracking systems. Objective: To design, develop, and implement an integrated mobile phone <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> <b>system</b> used to follow up with patients with HIV and TB in treatment in Mozambique. Methods: Following the design science research methodology, we developed a Web-based system that provides support to patients.

In line with the goal of Healthy People 2020, the purpose of this evidence-based quality improvement (QI) project was to implement a <b>text</b> <b>message</b> reminder <b>system,</b> and calculate the completion rate of the 3 -dose HPV vaccination series among adolescents in a pediatric clinic in a small city in Texas. The results were compared to the vaccination rates from a previously used reminder system. The project was of a single-group. pre-test–post-test design. Participants were adolescents aged 9 – 18 years who had begun, or were set to begin, the 3 -dose HPV vaccine series during the project implementation period (October 2015 –April 2016). Data from a random review of 100 charts of adolescents reminded using the prior system (prior to implementation) for the same vaccine appointments were used for comparison with the new reminder system data. Enrollees received up to 3 <b>text</b> <b>message</b> reminders for each appointment. They were surveyed to evaluate their preference of a reminder system.

Study Design: Prospective rater blinded randomised trial. Place and Duration of Study: Sample: ED of Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Methodology: 100 patients presenting with self-harm to the ED will be randomised to receive treatment as usual plus supportive and interactive <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> for three months or to receive treatment as usual. Patients in both groups will be followed up at 1, 3 and 6 months to ascertain frequency and intensity of thoughts of self-harm and selfharming behaviour. Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis using SPSS version 20 for Windows with descriptive statistics, student’s t-test, ANOVA analysis and chi-square tests. Results: We hypothesize that supportive, informative and interactive <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> delivered to patients discharged from an ED after an episode of self-harm will significantly reduce the frequency and intensity of thoughts of self-harm and self-harming behaviour in patients compared with those receiving only follow-up treatment as usual.

40|$|Short {{messaging}} service (SMS) {{is perhaps the}} most popular mobile technology prevalent among students in higher education due to its ubiquitous nature and the capability of two-way communication. However, a major limitation in two-way <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> is sending back a part of received data with the reply message.
