5|$|In 1846, the Plymouth and Padstow Railway company took an {{interest}} in trying to remove the Doom Bar, hoping <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>trade</b> through the harbour at Padstow. The plan was to create a breakwater on the bar, which would stop the build-up of sand, and the railway would transport sand from the nearby dunes to where it was needed for agricultural purposes elsewhere in the south west.|$|E

The provincial road system is better than {{in some parts of}} the country, but remains in somewhat bad condition. National Road 78 between Banlung and the Vietnam border was built between 2007 and 2010; the road was expected <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>trade</b> between Cambodia and Vietnam. There is a small airport in Banlung, but commercial flights to Ratanakiri have long been discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{from the}} inland mines in {{southern}} County Durham {{was taken away}} on packhorses, and then horse and carts as the roads were improved. A canal was proposed by George Dixon in 1767 and again by John Rennie in 1815, but both schemes failed. Meanwhile, the port of Stockton-on-Tees, from which the Durham coal was transported onwards by sea, had invested considerably during the early 19th century in straightening the Tees {{in order to improve}} navigation on the river downstream of the town and was subsequently looking for ways <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>trade</b> to recoup those costs.|$|E

5|$|In foreign policy, Grant sought <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>trade</b> and {{influence}} while remaining {{at peace with}} the world. With Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, he successfully resolved the Alabama claims through the Treaty of Washington with Great Britain. Grant and Fish negotiated a peaceful resolution with Spain over the Virginius Affair. Congress rejected Grant's initiative to annex the Dominican Republic, creating a rift among Republicans. His administration implemented a gold standard and sought to strengthen the dollar. Grant's immediate response to the Panic of 1873 failed to halt a severe industrial depression that produced high unemployment, deflation, and bankruptcies. When Grant left office in 1877, he embarked on a two-year world tour that captured favorable global attention for him and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Sale's {{shopping}} centre was redeveloped during the 1960s, {{as part of}} the town's post-war regeneration. In 1973, the shopping precinct in the town centre, which had grown up in the mid-19th century, was also redeveloped and pedestrianised in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>trade.</b> The construction of the M63 motorway (subsequently renamed the M60) in 1972 {{led to the creation of}} Sale Water Park. To minimise the risk of flooding, the new road was built on an embankment, for which the necessary gravel was extracted from what is today an artificial lake and water-sports centre. Opportunities for leisure were increased when the old swimming baths, demolished in 1971, were replaced in 1973 by a new complex built on the same site.|$|E
5|$|The {{years of}} Mary's reign were {{consistently}} wet. The persistent rain and subsequent flooding led to famine. Another {{problem was the}} decline of the Antwerp cloth trade. Despite Mary's marriage to Philip, England did not benefit from Spain's enormously lucrative trade with the New World. The Spanish guarded their trade routes jealously, and Mary could not condone illicit trade or piracy against her husband. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>trade</b> and rescue the English economy, Mary's counsellors continued Northumberland's policy of seeking out new commercial opportunities. She granted a royal charter to the Muscovy Company, whose first governor was Sebastian Cabot, and commissioned a world atlas from Diogo Homem. Adventurers such as John Lok and William Towerson sailed south in an attempt to develop links with the coast of Africa.|$|E

5|$|The Tennant Canal was a {{development}} of the Glan-y-wern Canal, which was built across Crymlyn Bog to transport coal from a colliery on its northern edge to a creek on the River Neath called Red Jacket Pill. It closed after 20 years, but was enlarged and extended by George Tennant in 1818, to provide a navigable link from the River Neath to the River Tawe at Swansea docks. In order <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>trade,</b> he built an extension to Aberdulais basin, where it linked to the Neath Canal. The extension was built without an act of Parliament {{and there was a}} long delay while Tennant attempted to resolve a dispute with a landowner over the routing of the canal. Once opened, much of the Neath traffic used the Tennant Canal, as Swansea provided better facilities for transferring cargo to ships.|$|E
5|$|White ran unsuccessfully as a Nationalist for the House of Representatives seat of Maribyrnong in the 1925 elections. In 1927, {{he failed}} to win the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of Prahran. Denied {{pre-selection}} as a Nationalist for the Senate the following year, he won the seat of Balaclava at a by-election held on 3August 1929. He succeeded retiring member William Watt. The United Australia Party (UAP) {{came to power in}} the 1931 elections and in March 1933 he was appointed Minister for Trade and Customs in the first Lyons Ministry, replacing Henry Gullett, who had stood down due to ill-health. White had given up the directorship of C.J. White & Sons the previous year. His portfolio was responsible for reducing tariffs and attempting <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>trade</b> with Britain as opposed to the United States and Japan, and also with book and film censorship; for the latter he established an advisory board, chaired by Robert Garran, to make recommendations to him. In 1934, White became Australian chairman of the Royal Life Saving Society, serving until 1951; he was also an active supporter of such organisations as Legacy and the Royal Flying Doctor Service.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century, {{in common}} with many other English towns, Cambridge {{expanded}} rapidly, due in part <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> life expectancy and improved agricultural production leading <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> <b>trade</b> in town markets.

The Lewes Pound and the Transition Towns movement have received criticism for a failure {{to address the needs of}} the wider Lewes population, especially lower socio-economic groups. Such local currency initiatives have been more widely criticized in light of limited success stimulating new spending in local economies and as an unrealistic strategy to reduce carbon emissions. The Lewes Pound can be exchanged for the same amount of pounds sterling in several shops in Lewes and can be spent in a wide range of local businesses. Many of the notes were sold on eBay at a higher amount. Early numbers and sequenced notes fetched very high prices from foreign collectors.|$|E

Other large Christmas markets have been held in England in Bath (since 2000) or Liverpool (since 2006).
