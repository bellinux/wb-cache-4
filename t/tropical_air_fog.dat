2500|$|Each {{air mass}} type brings in {{different}} temperature and moisture properties. The continental polar air mass brings in cold and dry air from central Canada, traveling south across the region. The continental <b>tropical</b> <b>air</b> mass comes {{in from the}} Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, bringing in hot and dry air while moving north. The maritime <b>tropical</b> <b>air</b> mass comes from the southwest United States and Northern Mexico, and it tends to bring in warm and moist air, but sometimes the air that comes in is dry. The last air mass that affects this ecoregion is the maritime polar air mass. It comes in from the Pacific Ocean and moves east over the mountain regions. It brings in cool moist air that changes to warm dry air after moving over the mountains. These air masses cause the seasons to be very extreme and drastic. The winter time brings harsh and varied weather. The midsummer months bring in warm moist and dry air, depending on the area within the region and what air masses affect those areas.|$|R
