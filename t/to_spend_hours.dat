5|$|As {{well as a}} fencing and archery enthusiast, Parsons {{was also}} a keen shooter; he often hunted jack rabbits and cotton tails in the desert, and was amused by mock dueling with Forman while on test sites with rifles and shotguns. Upon proposing to his first wife Helen, he gifted her a pistol. Parsons enjoyed playing pranks on his colleagues, often through detonating {{explosives}} such as firecrackers and smoke bombs, and was known <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>hours</b> {{at a time in}} the bathtub playing with toy boats while living at the Parsonage.|$|E
5|$|McCrane had <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>hours</b> in makeup {{in order}} to get the right effect and his eyes were colored with {{specially}} made contact lenses. Many of the scenes were physically exerting. The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning himself through a hole in the table and sitting perfectly still, giving the illusion of a disembodied head. The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to spend several minutes motionless underwater. The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one's mouth was created by Toby Lindala. Lindala used shots of McCrane intercut with shots of a puppet with full-functioning mouth and eyes. Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series. In addition, the machine that created a slice of Betts' head was designed by Ken Hawryliew.|$|E
5|$|Rancho Grande {{was located}} at a {{mountain}} pass in {{a branch of}} the Andes known as the Venezuelan Coastal Range, which was an important migration route for butterflies, and the station proved very lucrative in the study of insects. During his work at Rancho Grande, Beebe broke his leg in a fall from a ladder, and the forced immobility which resulted from having his leg in a cast presented him with a new opportunity for observing the area's wildlife. At his request, he and his chair were transported into the nearby jungle, and as he sat motionless the wild animals around him soon began to go about their business without noticing his presence. His immobility also presented him with the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>hours</b> at a time observing a pair of bat falcons through binoculars, documenting the behavior of their two chicks and every prey item fed to them by their parents. His observations documented several behaviors which were new to science, including the first documented example of play in birds.|$|E

25|$|Calories for civilians {{from food}} {{controlled}} by rations amounted to roughly 1,350 {{per day in}} the 1941-44 period. The minimum amount is 1,500 for women and 2,000 for men. Rationed calories halved {{in the winter of}} 1944/5 making food an obsession, with the poor in the towns having <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>hours</b> queuing for a few cabbage leaves and potato peelings, fainting with hunger, even after the life saving Red Cross parcels started to arrive.|$|E
500|$|One black {{motorist}} {{observed in}} the early 1940s that while black travelers felt free in the mornings, by the early afternoon a [...] "small cloud" [...] had appeared. By the late afternoon, [...] "it casts a shadow of apprehension on our hearts and sours us a little. 'Where,' it asks us, 'will you stay tonight?'". They often had <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>hours</b> in the evening trying to find somewhere to stay, sometimes resorting to sleeping in haylofts or in their own cars if they could not find anywhere. One alternative, if it was available, was to arrange in advance to sleep at the homes of black friends in towns or cities along their route. However, this meant detours and an abandonment of the spontaneity that for many was a key attraction of motoring.|$|E
500|$|Pathways was a {{critical}} success. Inside Mac Games reviewer Jon Blum wrote in 1993 that Pathways was [...] "one of the best Macintosh games I've ever played". Computer Gaming World described Pathways as [...] "a dungeon crawl, pure and simple". While describing the game before obtaining a gun as [...] "tedious" [...] and criticizing {{the small number of}} save points per level, the magazine praised the [...] "simple, elegant and easy to use" [...] user interface and [...] "excellent" [...] graphics and sound. Computer Gaming World concluded that while [...] "somewhat weak on actual game play", Pathways was [...] "a job worthy of a strong recommendation". Macworlds Steven Levy commented that the gameplay and graphics were extremely smooth. He singled out the creatures for specific praise, likening them to [...] "something that might have come from a brain-merge of Tim Burton, Anne Rice and Hieronymus Bosch" [...] instead of simple line drawings. Complaints and criticisms of the game included the difficulty level; Blum found some segments too difficult and that it was possible <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>hours</b> playing before realizing that the player had made an irreversible mistake. Jones admitted that the game was harder than he intended. The title received several awards, including Inside Mac Games' [...] "Adventure Game of the Year", Macworlds [...] "Best Role-Playing Game", and was listed on the MacUser 100.|$|E

500|$|For Part 2, Steve Miner asked Carl Fullerton, the make-up effects supervisor, {{to stick}} to Savini's {{original}} design, but Fullerton only had one day to design and sculpt a new head. Fullerton drew a rough sketch of what he believed Jason should look like, and had it approved by Miner. Fullerton added long hair to the character. Gillette had <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>hours</b> in a chair as they applied rubber forms all over his face, and had to keep one eye closed while the [...] "droopy eye" [...] application was in place. Gillette's eye was closed for twelve {{hours at a time}} while he was filming the final scenes of the film. False teeth created by a local dentist were used to distort Gillette's face. Much of the basic concept of Fullerton's design was eliminated for Part 3. Miner wanted to use a combination of the designs from Tom Savini and Carl Fullerton, but as work progressed the design began to lean more and more toward Savini's concept. Stan Winston was hired to create a design for Jason's head, but the eyes were level and Doug White, the make-up artist for Part 3, needed a droopy right eye. White did keep Winston's design for the back of the head, because the crew did not have the time to design an entirely new head for Jason. The process of creating Jason's look was hard work for White, who had to constantly make alterations to Richard Brooker's face, even up to the last day of filming.|$|E

Amnesty International also reported that a student was forced at gunpoint by plainclothes officers to sign a confession to acts he did not commit where his mother explained that “They told him that they would kill him if he didn’t sign it, ... He started to cry, but he wouldn’t sign it. They then wrapped him in foam sheets and started to hit him with rods and a fire extinguisher. Later, they doused him with gasoline, stating that they would then have evidence to charge him.” Amnesty International said that the Human Rights Center at the Andres Bello Catholic University had reported that, “There are two cases that involved electric shocks, two cases that involved pepper gas and another two cases where they were doused with gasoline,” she said. “We’ve found there to be systematic conduct {{on the part of}} the state to inflict inhumane treatment on detainees because of similar reports from different days and detention centers.” ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had stopped}} {{to look in}} at a picture shop, for Soames was an 'amateur' of pictures, and had a little-room in No. 62, Montpellier Square, full of canvases, stacked against the wall, which he had no room to hang.

It never occurred to her to run childishly wild with delight in the garden and orchard as did Dennet, who, with little five-years-old Will Streatfield for her guide and playfellow, rushed about hither and thither, making acquaintance with hens and chickens, geese and goslings, seeing cows and goats milked, watching butter churned, bringing all manner of animal and vegetable curiosities to Stephen to be named and explained, and enjoying his delight in them, a delight which after the first few days became more and more vigorous.|$|E

6000|$|Early in {{my school}} days a boy had {{a copy of the}} 'Wonders of the World,' which I often read, and disputed with other boys about the {{veracity}} of some of the statements; and I believe that this book first gave me a wish to travel in remote countries, which was ultimately fulfilled by the voyage of the [...] "Beagle". In the latter part of my school life I became passionately fond of shooting; I do not believe that any one could have shown more zeal for the most holy cause than I did for shooting birds. How well I remember killing my first snipe, and my excitement was so great that I had much difficulty in reloading my gun from the trembling of my hands. This taste long continued, and I became a very good shot. When at Cambridge I used to practise throwing up my gun to my shoulder before a looking-glass to see that I threw it up straight. Another and better plan was to get a friend to wave about a lighted candle, and then to fire at it with a cap on the nipple, and if the aim was accurate the little puff of air would blow out the candle. The explosion of the cap caused a sharp crack, and I was told that the tutor of the college remarked, [...] "What an extraordinary thing it is, Mr. Darwin seems <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>hours</b> in cracking a horse-whip in his room, for I often hear the crack when I pass under his windows." ...|$|E
