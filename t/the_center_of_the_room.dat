5|$|The {{illusion}} of endless rows of Klingons {{was created by}} brightly lighting the accused in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with a bright blue light, then letting {{the rest of the}} set fall into shadow. To give the set a larger appearance, a shot from high above the courtroom was created using miniatures. Inspired by a scene in Ben-Hur, matte supervisor Craig Barron used two hundred commercially available Worf dolls sent by Ralph Winter. Angry Klingons were created by rocking the dolls back and forth with motors, waving sticks lit by twelve-volt light bulbs dyed red. The resulting courtroom miniature was ten feet long.|$|E
5|$|Francisco Rafael was celebrating his 64th {{birthday}} {{along with}} his wife, children, and friends at Ocean House, a beachfront banquet hall owned by Hotel Marbella in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur on 18 October 2013. There were about 80 to 100 attendees at the party, including prominent businessmen, politicians, celebrities, and sport figures like former Mexican footballer Jared Borgetti and boxing champion Omar Chávez. The party also hosted a number of musical groups, including banda La Cabeña, El Mariachi de Los Cabos, and the former leading vocalist of Banda El Recodo. At around 8:00p.m. that day, a black-colored SUV entered the private property and parked near {{the entrance of the}} ballroom. In the front seats of the car, according to eye-witness reports, were two men; in the back seat was a man dressed as a clown, who descended from the vehicle and headed towards the door that led to the kitchen. Once inside the ballroom, the clown identified Francisco Rafael at <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and began to walk towards him. When the clown was about 1m (3.3ft) close, he pulled out a pistol from his costume and shot him point-blank in his head and then several times more as he fell to the ground, killing him on the scene. As the former drug lord lay dead near the entrance, the assassin ran through a rear exit while the attendees yelled, fell to the ground, and hid under the tables. Four more shots were heard outside the ballroom shortly after the attack; according to eyewitnesses, the clown had done this to scare off one of Francisco Rafael's sons, who was chasing him. The suspect then fled the crime scene in the black-colored SUV and headed towards the highway.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either {{in a corner of the}} handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> lines joining <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{circles in}} Fig. 2 are {{perpendicular}} to the line segments AP, BQ and CR. For example, <b>the</b> line joining <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle containing ARB and <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle containing AQC, is {{perpendicular to the}} segment AP. So, <b>the</b> lines joining <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circles also intersect at 60° angles. Therefore <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circles form an equilateral triangle. This is known as Napoleon's Theorem.|$|R

25|$|With {{the advent}} of the chimney, the hearth moved from <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> to one wall, and the first brick-and-mortar hearths were built. The fire was lit on top of the construction; a vault {{underneath}} served to store wood. Pots made of iron, bronze, or copper started to replace the pottery used earlier. The temperature was controlled by hanging the pot higher or lower over the fire, or placing it on a trivet or directly on the hot ashes. Using open fire for cooking (and heating) was risky; fires devastating whole cities occurred frequently.|$|E
25|$|The {{basement}} proper was {{one hundred}} {{feet long and}} forty feet wide with six rooms of varying sized on either side. The sides of the rooms were stone and abutted the massive stone piers that supported the floors above. With {{the exception of the}} two rooms at the West end of the basement, reportedly used for clerical purposes, each side room rose two steps in height from the basement floor. The rooms were dressing rooms for those using the font. The floor was made of red brick laid in a herringbone pattern. The walls were painted white. The floor sloped down to <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> to allow water to run toward a drain beneath the font.|$|E
25|$|Until the 19th century, in an Ashkenazi synagogue, all seats {{most often}} faced the Torah Ark. In a Sephardi synagogue, seats were usually {{arranged}} {{around the perimeter}} of the sanctuary, but when the worshipers stood up to pray, everyone faced the Ark. In Ashkenazi synagogues, the Torah was read on a reader's table located in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> while the leader of the prayer service, the hazzan, stood at his own lectern or table, facing the Ark. In Sephardic synagogues, the table for reading the Torah (reading dais) was commonly placed at the opposite side of the room from the Torah Ark, leaving the center of the floor empty for the use of a ceremonial procession carrying the Torah between the Ark and the reading table.|$|E
50|$|Tidally-locked {{bodies have}} a natural {{reference}} longitude passing through the point nearest to their parent body: 0° <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary-facing hemisphere, 90° <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading hemisphere, 180° <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anti-primary hemisphere, and 270° <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trailing hemisphere.

500|$|According to the June 16, 1930 {{issue of}} Time magazine, {{visitors}} carrying ripened wheat heads stared in curiosity at the six-story tall trading room directly above {{the lobby and}} behind the large windows below the clock facing LaSalle Street. At <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> Time reported on the items being traded in [...] "pits" [...] organized based on commodities type with pits names such as the corn pit, soybean pit or wheat pit. The individual pits are raised octagonal structures where open outcry trading occurs. Steps up the outside of each octagon provide an amphitheater atmosphere, and enable {{a large number of}} traders to see each other and communicate during trading hours. With early versions dating back to 1870, this type of trading pit was patented in 1878.|$|E
500|$|Production {{designer}} Shepherd Frankel specifically set out {{to create}} distinctly different environments for the three employees and their respective bosses' homes and offices.

[...] The design team met with financial strategists and management companies to learn about the architecture of their office layouts to visually represent the experience of starting from a low-ranking position in a cubicle and aspiring to an office. Costume designer Carol Ramsey worked with Frankel and set decorator Jan Pascale to match Harken's suit to that of the surrounding [...] "cold grey and blue" [...] color palette of his office. Harken's home was described as [...] "equally lacking in warmth" [...] as the office but more lavishly decorated and [...] "for show", including an intentionally oversized portrait of him with his [...] "trophy wife".|$|E
500|$|On October 14, West, in {{collaboration}} with Italian artist Vanessa Beecroft, hosted a promotional album listening event at Ace Gallery. Over 700 guests were invited to preview the entirety of 808s & Heartbreak. Under Beecroft's guidance, the event featured approximately forty nude women wearing nothing besides wool masks who silently stood in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> The women were illuminated by multicolored lights that would change as the music progressed. When {{it came time for}} him to speak, West stated that he'd been a fan of Beecroft's work and strong imagery, saying that he liked the idea of nudity because [...] "society told us to wear clothes at a certain point". Beecroft had been contacted a month prior and conceptualized and generated the installation in a week. Beecroft admitted that while he had caught her offguard, she had the opportunity to hear the album for herself and heard things that touched her own life. Five days later, promotional photos for the album by photographer Willy Vanderperre were released. The images portrayed West wearing a grey glen plaid suit, large browline glasses, and a heart-shaped pin.|$|E

500|$|The {{second is}} [...] "No Strings (I'm Fancy Free)". [...] On {{retiring}} {{to his hotel}} suite, Horton advises him to get married. Astaire declares his preference for bachelorhood and the song – this number {{was the brainchild of}} scriptwriter Dwight Taylor and is found in his earliest drafts – emerges naturally and in mid-sentence. Astaire sings it through twice and during the last phrase leaps into a ballet jump, accompanied by leg beats, and launches into a short solo dance that builds in intensity and volume progressing from tap shuffles sur place, via traveling patterns, to rapid-fire heel jabs finishing with a carefree tour of the suite during which he beats on the furniture with his hands. On his return to <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> where he noisily concentrates his tap barrage, the camera cranes down to discover Rogers in bed, awake and irritated. As she makes her way upstairs, Horton fields telephone complaints from hotel management. Astaire incorporates this into his routine, first startling him with a tap burst then escorting him ostentatiously to the telephone. As Horton leaves to investigate, Astaire continues to hammer his way around the suite, during which he feigns horror at seeing his image in a mirror – a reference to his belief that the camera was never kind to his face. The routine ends as Astaire, now dancing with a statue, is interrupted by Rogers' entrance, a scene which, as in The Gay Divorcee and Roberta, typifies the way in which Astaire inadvertently incurs the hostility of Rogers, only to find her attractive and wear down her resistance.|$|E
