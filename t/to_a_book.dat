5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Chatwin spent an {{increasing}} {{amount of time}} in New York City. He continued to have affairs with men, but most of these affairs were short-lived. In 1977 he began his first serious affair with Donald Richards, an Australian stockbroker. Richards introduced him to the gay nightclub scene in New York. During this period Chatwin became acquainted with Robert Mapplethorpe, who photographed him. Chatwin {{is one of the few}} men Mapplethorpe photographed fully clothed. Chatwin later contributed the introduction <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> of Mapplethorpe's photographs, Lady, Lisa Lyon (1983).|$|E
5|$|Potter {{had long}} wanted {{to develop a}} book of nursery rhymes, but such a project left Warne cold. Rhymes were already well {{represented}} in the firm's catalogue, and Warne felt Potter's unbridled enthusiasm for the genre would make the project a headache for him. In the past, {{he had tried to}} discourage Potter's interest in rhymes, believing her own stories superior, but she persisted. He reluctantly agreed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> of rhymes for 1905, but Potter did not have it ready at the end of 1904, so he accepted the tea party tale instead. Early in 1905, it was decided the book would be published {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E

Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio had started working on a script in 2007, but they were interrupted by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, and only resumed in mid-2008.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{with the}} third edition, Darwin prefaced the {{introduction}} with a sketch of {{the historical development of}} evolutionary ideas. In that sketch he acknowledged that Patrick Matthew had, unknown to Wallace or himself, anticipated the concept of natural selection in an appendix <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> published in 1831; in the fourth edition he mentioned that William Charles Wells had done so as early as 1813.|$|E

5|$|An arc diagram or linear {{embedding}} places vertices of a graph along a line, {{and draws}} {{the edges of}} the graph as semicircles either above or below this line, sometimes also allowing edges to be drawn on segments of the line. This drawing style corresponds <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> embedding with either one page (if all semicircles are above the line) or two pages (if both sides of the line are used), and was originally introduced as a way of studying the crossing numbers of graphs. Planar graphs that do not have two-page book embeddings may also be drawn in a similar way, by allowing their edges to be represented by multiple semicircles above and below the line. Such a drawing is not a book embedding by the usual definition, but has been called a topological book embedding. For every planar graph, it is always possible to find such an embedding in which each edge crosses the spine at most once.|$|E
5|$|The Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year, {{originally}} {{known as}} the Diagram Group Prize for the Oddest Title at the Frankfurt Book Fair, commonly {{known as the}} Diagram Prize for short, is a humorous literary award that is given annually <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> with an unusual title. The prize is named after the Diagram Group, an information and graphics company based in London, and The Bookseller, a British trade magazine for the publishing industry. Originally organised to provide entertainment during the 1978 Frankfurt Book Fair, the prize has since been awarded every year by The Bookseller and is now organised by the magazine's diarist Horace Bent. The winner was initially decided by a panel of judges, but since 2000 the winner has been decided by a public vote on The Bookseller′s website.|$|E
5|$|Wallace Glenn Wilkinson (December 12, 1941 – July 5, 2002) was an American {{businessman}} and politician from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. From 1987 to 1991, {{he served as}} the state's 57th governor. Wilkinson {{dropped out of college}} at the University of Kentucky in 1962 to attend <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> retail business he started. The business rapidly became a national success, and Wilkinson re-invested his profits in real estate, farming, transportation, banking, coal, and construction ventures, becoming extremely wealthy. In 1987, he joined a crowded field in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. After running behind two former governors and the sitting lieutenant governor for most of the race, Wilkinson began to climb in the polls after hiring then-unknown campaign consultant James Carville. Wilkinson campaigned on a promise of no new taxes and advocated a state lottery as an alternative means of raising money for the state. Wilkinson surprised most political observers by winning the primary and going on to defeat his Republican challenger in the general election.|$|E

5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E
