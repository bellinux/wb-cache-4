5|$|After {{getting off}} the bed, the Hero is then given a task to get a crown in {{preparation}} for the annual Mountain Spirit festival from the elder which takes him to Haggleton. However he finds out the man that is supposed to make the crown has gone out somewhere to the northwest of town and never came back. The hero then heads in <b>that</b> <b>direction</b> and finds a large hole with the crown maker just barely hanging on. The hero attempts to rescue him and succeeds but in the process, slips and falls to the world below. In this mysterious world, the hero finds a nearby town in which the townspeople cannot see him. The hero grabs a tip from one of the townspeople that there's a special well to the north which people went in never came back; thus the hero heads in <b>that</b> <b>direction</b> and returns to his world.|$|E

5000|$|One quirk {{of common}} Montreal parlance is <b>that</b> <b>directions</b> (north, south, east, and west) {{along the street}} grid are sharply skewed {{relative}} to the actual compass directions.

[...] In much of Montreal, [...] "north" [...] is actually northwest, and in some areas such as Verdun and Pointe-aux-Trembles it is actually due west. [...] "Montreal directions" [...] are used in naming street addresses and describing bus routes, among other things.

The remnants of Josephine tracked southward and completed the cyclonic loop on October19.

The Zubu were located at the northwest border of Liao territory and had fought several wars with the Liao when the Liao tried to expand in <b>that</b> <b>direction.</b> In 1092 the Liao attacked several other tribes in the northwest, and by 1093 the Zubu attacked the Liao, striking deep into Khitan territory. It took until 1100 for the Liao to capture and kill the Zubu chieftain, and another two years to fight off the remaining Zubu forces. The war against the Zubu was the last successful military campaign waged by the Liao dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Avinor {{has also}} {{proposed}} lowering the terrain {{east of the}} airport. The terrain is actually flatter to the east, but because the runway was expanded in <b>that</b> <b>direction,</b> the extension cannot be used without removing all ground in the twelve-degree slope. Although it has no impact on smaller aircraft, the reduced runway length has a severe impact {{on the performance of}} Boeing 737 aircraft, which are used by both Norwegian and SAS. For instance, during winter a 180-seat 737-800 can only utilize 71 percent of its permitted take-off weight; this would hinder fully loaded aircraft flying further than Oslo. The impacts for 150-seat 737-700 aircraft are smaller, as they can reach Oslo during winter and Berlin during summer. The airport served 169,428 passengers in 1996 and 216,000 passengers in 2000.|$|E

By contrast, writer Caroline Dries feels that Lana did love Lex, and {{that she did not}} make any hasty decisions when she agreed to marry him. Dries believes that the progression of the show demonstrates that Lex earned Lana's love. To answer viewers that hated to see Lana marry Lex, Dries contends that as viewers we are seeing all of Lex, including how evil he truly is, while Lana only sees the portion of Lex that appears good.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the area}} where Bernetz Brook enters the La Chute, Captain Trépezet and his troop, who were {{attempting}} {{to return to the}} French lines, encountered Phineas Lyman's Connecticut regiment, sparking a skirmish in the woods. General Howe's column was near the action, so he led it in <b>that</b> <b>direction.</b> As they approached the battle scene, General Howe was hit and instantly killed by a musket ball. A column of Massachusetts provincials, also drawn to the battle, cut off the French patrol's rear. In desperate fighting, about 150 of Trepézet's men were killed, and another 150 were captured. Fifty men, including Trepézet, escaped by swimming across the La Chute. Trepézet died the next day of wounds suffered in the battle.|$|E
