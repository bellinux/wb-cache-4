5|$|Many dragonflies, {{particularly}} males, are territorial. Some {{defend a}} territory against others {{of their own}} species, some against other species of dragonfly and a few against insects in unrelated groups. A particular perch may give a dragonfly a good view over an insect-rich feeding ground, and the blue dasher (Pachydiplax longipennis) jostles other dragonflies to maintain the right <b>to</b> <b>alight</b> there.|$|E
25|$|A halt, in railway parlance in the Commonwealth of Nations and Republic of Ireland, {{is a small}} station, usually unstaffed or {{with very}} few staff, and with few or no facilities. In some cases, trains stop only on request, when {{passengers}} on the platform indicate that they wish to board, or passengers on the train inform the crew that they wish <b>to</b> <b>alight.</b>|$|E

25|$|In Victoria, Australia, a rail motor {{stopping}} place (RMSP) is {{a location}} on a railway line {{where a small}} passenger vehicle or railmotor can stop to allow passengers <b>to</b> <b>alight.</b> It is often designated by just a sign beside the railway at a convenient access point near a road. The passenger can hail the train driver to stop, and buy a ticket from the guard or the conductor on the train.|$|E
25|$|Carriages are the SW class, rebuilt British Rail Mark 2 {{carriages}} {{introduced in}} 2007 {{to replace the}} NZR 56-foot carriages used since the service's introduction, {{some of which were}} 70 years old. Eighteen carriages are used – twelve SW with 64 seats; three SWS with 37 seats, wheelchair hoist and disabled toilet; and three SWG with 37 seats, luggage compartment and generator. The carriages are formed into three sets of between three and eight carriages, consisting of (from the Masterton end of train) an SWG, an SW, an SWS, and then the remaining SW carriages. Because of the short platforms at Renall Street, Solway, Matarawa and Maymorn stations, selective door operation is employed and passengers are asked <b>to</b> <b>alight</b> from the three northernmost (Masterton-end) carriages.|$|E
25|$|The stop {{is located}} at the {{midpoint}} of a single track unidirectional turning loop around Belmore Park. The stop consists of two platforms. Trams stop at the first platform to allow passengers <b>to</b> <b>alight,</b> then pull up to the second platform to allow boarding. The use of the loop avoids having to terminate the vehicles and the removes the need for the driver to change ends. This loop was not new; it had been used until 1957 as a route on the former Sydney tramway system, but in the opposite direction. The covered area in which the light rail stop is located was previously used as a staff car-park and bus interchange. The stop received an upgrade during January 2017 when the city section of the line was closed for works at the George and Hay Streets intersection.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} is very {{efficient}} at eating its prey; {{not only is}} it able to splinter and eat the largest ungulate bones, it is also able to digest them completely. Spotted hyenas can digest all organic components in bones, not just the marrow. Any inorganic material is excreted with the faeces, which consist almost entirely of a white powder with few hairs. They react <b>to</b> <b>alighting</b> vultures more readily than other African carnivores, {{and are more likely to}} stay in the vicinity of lion kills or human settlements.|$|R

25|$|The Canal Street Portal (also Haymarket Portal, North Station Portal or Causeway Street Portal, often {{referred}} to in revenue service as the Canal Street Loop) {{was part of the}} transition between subway and elevated railway on the Green Line, as it transitioned from the Tremont Street Subway to the Causeway Street Elevated towards the Lechmere Viaduct until 2004, when the Green Line north of North Station was closed for building of a new tunnel and portal. Certain trains turned at Canal Street, while others emerged from the subway to a viaduct to Lechmere. It was, however, possible for a passenger <b>to</b> <b>alight</b> from a train at Canal Street and proceed up a series of stairways to the Lechmere Viaduct. However, most passengers desiring to continue to Science Park or Lechmere would have changed to a Lechmere signed car from a North Station signed car prior to the emergence from the central subway.|$|E
25|$|Announcement of the {{judgement}} and {{sentence was}} delayed by six hours, leading to chaos outside the court. Soon after, sporadic incidents of violence were reported {{across the state}} initiated by the AIADMK and Jayalalithaa loyalists. Most shops, restaurants, malls and movie halls remained closed and public transport was totally stopped. The neighbouring state of Karnataka and Kerala stopped inter-state buses to Tamil Nadu. A state-owned bus was set ablaze near Kanchipuram before passengers were made <b>to</b> <b>alight.</b> The governor of Tamil Nadu, K. Rosiah ordered operations to maintain law and order and, while the police said that the situation was under control, opposition parties complained of violence. The leader of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, M. Karunanidhi, wrote to the President of India and the Prime Minister seeking restoration of peace. The Central Home Ministry offered support to control violence. Venkatesan, a 65-year-old fan of Jayalilathaa, immolated himself in Chennai as a mark of protest and died later in hospital. Another follower tried self-immolation {{in front of the}} house of Jayalalithaa at Poes Gardens but was stopped by the police.|$|E
500|$|The Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway (L) was {{the third}} line, which opened on 25 June 1840, {{initially}} using the North Union station. However, relations between the NUR and L soured, and, from 1 January 1842, most L trains used, instead, Maxwell House railway station, a short distance {{to the north of}} the North Union station. A few trains passed through, but the NUR charged a toll of 6d per passenger. Most passengers refused to pay, preferring <b>to</b> <b>alight</b> at Maxwell House and walk the [...] to the North Union station, but the NUR refused to hold the train to allow passengers to walk and rebook. The NUR advised northbound passengers to travel by the Lancaster Canal rather than the L On 1 January 1844, Maxwell House station came into the possession of the NUR, and lack of agreement led to several weeks when hapless L passengers had <b>to</b> <b>alight</b> on the trackside at nearby Dock Street (off Pitt Street). Lancaster trains were able to use the North Union station from 12 February.|$|E

50|$|Build-A-Bird was {{designed}} and developed by Ergonomics Lab, University of Toronto. Gameplay revolved around creating a bird by choosing from a selection of different body parts such as stork-like legs, short legs adapted <b>to</b> <b>alighting</b> on various natural surfaces, or predatory talons. Beak type and wing type were also among the changeable body part selections in Build-A-Bird. Upon selecting your preferred, various body part types the game would provide one or several real life birds that fit your selections. What happened next in the game involved educational material about your bird's range and habitat. The visual representations of the birds, their body parts and the bird habitats were in colour and vivid for the time but lacked animation.|$|R

Associated trees include the grey box (Eucalyptus moluccana), snappy gum (E. racemosa) and narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri) in a study at three sites in western Sydney. At Hawks Nest in coastal swampy sclerophyll woodland, adults were observed mainly on swamp mahogany (Eucalyptus robusta) and sometimes blackbutt (E. pilularis), as well as Allocasuarina littoralis and introduced pine (Pinus radiata). Nymphs feed primarily on the roots of eucalypts.|$|E
500|$|Blandine and Cosima were {{subjected}} to the Patersi curriculum for four years. Cosima's biographer Oliver Hilmes likens the regime to that used for breaking in horses, though Marek describes it as exacting but ultimately beneficial to Cosima: [...] "Above all, Patersi taught her how a 'noble lady' must behave, how <b>to</b> <b>alight</b> from a carriage, how to enter a drawing room, how to greet a duchess as against a commoner ... and how not to betray herself when she was hurt". On 10 October 1853 Liszt arrived at the Patersi apartment, {{his first visit to}} his daughters since 1845. With him were two fellow-composers: Hector Berlioz and Richard Wagner. Carolyne's daughter Marie, who was present, described Cosima's appearance as [...] "in the worst phase of adolescence, tall and angular, sallow ... the image of her father. Only her long golden hair, of unusual sheen, was beautiful". After a family meal, Wagner read to the group from his text for the final act of what was to become Götterdämmerung. Cosima seems to have made little impression on him; in his memoirs he merely recorded that both girls were very shy.|$|E
40|$|The behaviour, {{development}} and reproductive capacity of Aphis craccivora, vector {{of a number}} of groundnut viruses, are compared on a range of susceptible and resistant genotypes. Field trials demonstrated no significant difference between genotypes in the rate of arrival of alates, but population development was slower, and subsequent population decline faster, on the genotype EC 36892 (ICG 5240). Behavioural studies in the screenhouse, likewise showed no inhibition <b>to</b> <b>alighting</b> onto EC 36892 though choice tests demonstrated a significant redistribution of the population in favour of the susceptible genotype TMV 2 (ICG 221) over the following 10 h.

Dave Golder of SFX magazine gave the episode {{five out of}} five stars, calling it [...] "a genuinely magical episode of Who, high on atmosphere...and bursting with charm". John Moore, writing on Den of Geek, also took a positive stance towards the episode, describing it as [...] "life-affirming" [...] as a Doctor Who fan, and, though he did criticise some elements of the plot, likewise wrote positively about the ending, ultimately finding the episode [...] "utterly useless, but absolutely art". Keith Watson in the Metro {{was surprised by the}} [...] "impressive imagining of Van Gogh's world", praising Curtis' humour throughout the episode. He also praised the performance by Curran as Van Gogh, feeling that, with regard to Van Gogh's depression, the producers [...] "pulled it off" [...] against the odds. Mark Lawson [...] of The Guardian praised it as [...] "exceptionally good" [...] and [...] "thrilling and funny, as well as educational", noting its [...] "historical rigour" [...] and its [...] "good arty jokes", while Deborah Orr wrote that it was [...] "hardly original for someone <b>to</b> <b>alight</b> on [...] tale as a tear-jerker, although it is pretty shrewd to think of placing it in a popular time-travel context" [...] and that [...] "the feeling that I'd been gently monstered into life-affirming feel-good sobs by Richard Curtis was not new, not in the least".|$|E

40|$|New train {{stock or}} train {{services}} are continually {{being added to}} the network in the UK.

This paper presents the results from a series of experiments testing the time required <b>to</b> board or <b>alight</b> a train across three different gap heights. The experiments were designed to test for the effect of age and luggage type on the time <b>to</b> board or <b>alight.</b> As expected, more steps result in a longer time required <b>to</b> board or <b>alight.</b> More interesting is the effect of age and luggage on time <b>to</b> board and <b>alight</b> with younger people being relatively unaffected by the presence of steps and luggage, whereas both these factors hinder elderly people. The quantification of these effects has implications for accessibility of train services and for train dwell times and can be used by others in the design and planning stages of rail projects...|$|R
50|$|The {{best way}} to reach Kothaligad {{is to take a}} {{suburban}} train going <b>to</b> Karjat and <b>alight</b> at Neral station.

2500|$|A {{passenger}} {{wishing to}} take a minibus simply hails the minibus from the street kerb like a taxi. A minibus can generally be hailed down at any point along a route, subject to traffic regulations, although sometimes particular stops are marked out. <b>To</b> <b>alight</b> from a minibus, a passenger customarily calls out to the driver where they wish to get off, drivers generally acknowledging by simply raising their hand. Tourists have difficulty with this system, as it generally requires both intimate local street knowledge and prior training in Cantonese. Passengers often call out landmarks, intersecting streets and other distinctive features (such as immediately before or after a no-stopping zone). Green minibuses may have fixed stops. Some Green minibuses are now equipped with a bell operated similarly to those found on the larger buses, and ringing it indicates that a passenger wishes <b>to</b> <b>alight</b> at the next stop. [...] Calling out to the driver, however, remains popular.|$|E
