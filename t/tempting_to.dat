5|$|The {{potential}} of the sticky bomb for physical humour has frequently proved too <b>tempting</b> <b>to</b> be neglected, a good example being David Niven's novel Go Slowly, Come Back Quickly. The unfortunate officer Stanni, while attempting to demolish a smelly privy, loses his dignity and a large section of trouser fabric to such an incident. The sticky bomb also featured in the British television comedy series Dad's Army. In the episode Fallen Idol Lance-Corporal Jack Jones sticks his grenade to an improvised target and retires as instructed but keeps a hold of the grenade which is now primed and stuck to an old dustbin lid.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} theme which {{drives the}} contest for the champion's portion is the rivalry between the royal provinces of Connacht and Ulster, {{resolved in the}} contest of the two heroes Cet Mac Mágach and Conall Cernach. The presentation of this rivalry is coloured by the author's peculiar Leinster viewpoint. He turns both provinces to ridicule by the cunning of Mac Da Thó, King of Leinster; in particular, the author's political sympathies favour Connacht and remain hostile to Ulster to the end. To the heroes assembled, Mac Da Thó boasts that all the food provided for the feast is a mere trifle for the Leinstermen. It is <b>tempting</b> <b>to</b> conclude that the inspiration {{of the story is}} the claim of Leinster to supersede both Ulster and Connacht. However, it is apparent that {{by the time of the}} tale's composition, even the story-teller does not take the political issues very seriously, using the theme instead as a vehicle for a good story.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that these}} {{examples}} are all highly symmetric—and thus simplified—it is <b>tempting</b> <b>to</b> {{conclude that the}} occurrence of singularities is an artifact of idealization. The famous singularity theorems, proved using the methods of global geometry, say otherwise: singularities are a generic feature of general relativity, and unavoidable once the collapse of an object with realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage and also {{at the beginning of}} a wide class of expanding universes. However, the theorems say little about the properties of singularities, and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities' generic structure (hypothesized e.g. by the BKL conjecture). The cosmic censorship hypothesis states that all realistic future singularities (no perfect symmetries, matter with realistic properties) are safely hidden away behind a horizon, and thus invisible to all distant observers. While no formal proof yet exists, numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity.|$|E

5|$|The Elementary Education Act 1880 {{insisted on}} {{compulsory}} attendance from 5–10 years. For poorer families, ensuring their children attended school proved difficult, {{as it was}} more <b>tempting</b> <b>to</b> send them working if the opportunity to earn an extra income was available. Attendance Officers often visited the homes of children who failed to attend school, which often proved to be ineffective. Children {{under the age of}} 13 who were employed were required to have a certificate to show they had reached the educational standard; employers of these children who weren't able to show this were penalised. An act brought into force thirteen years later went under the name of the Elementary Education (School Attendance) Act 1893, which stated a raised minimum leaving age to 11. Later the same year, the act was also extended for blind and deaf children, who previously had no means of an official education. This act was later amended in 1899 to raise the school leaving age up to 12 years of age.|$|E
5|$|The {{offer of}} {{defection}} is received by MI6 in London, ostensibly from Romanova, but is conditional that Bond collects {{her and the}} Spektor from Istanbul. MI6 is unsure of Romanova's motive, but the prize of the Spektor is too <b>tempting</b> <b>to</b> ignore; Bond's superior, M, orders {{him to go to}} Turkey. Once there, Bond forms a comradeship with Darko Kerim, head of the British service's station in Turkey. Bond meets Romanova and they plan their route out of Turkey with the Spektor. He and Kerim believe her story and the three board the Orient Express. Kerim quickly discovers three Russian MGB agents on board, travelling incognito. He uses bribes and trickery to have two of them taken off the train, but he is later found dead in his compartment with the body of the third agent.|$|E
5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is {{so bright}} {{that it is}} {{difficult}} to stare at it directly. However, during an eclipse, with so much of the Sun covered, it is easier and more <b>tempting</b> <b>to</b> stare at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is as dangerous as looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a fraction of a second.|$|E

25|$|For late {{surrender}}, however, {{while it}} is <b>tempting</b> <b>to</b> opt for surrender on any hand which will probably lose, the correct strategy is to only surrender on the very worst hands, because having even a one in four chance of winning the full bet is better than losing half the bet and pushing the other half, as entailed by surrendering.|$|E

25|$|Glotz (1925:381) {{claimed that}} the clay was not from Crete. Ipsen (1929:15) {{concluded}} that the Disc was certainly from somewhere on the Aegean. Because of its differences from Linear A or B, Ipsen found it <b>tempting</b> <b>to</b> assume, like Evans, a non-Cretan origin for the Disc. He observes, however, that since Linear A was a common Aegean script such an assumption will not resolve the problem of multiplicity.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} interpretations for the orb Mary is holding {{in her right}} hand. It is <b>tempting</b> <b>to</b> construe it as the globus cruciger of the Holy Roman Empire. However, a globus cruciger is not attested {{as part of the}} Holy Roman regalia until the coronation of Conrad II in 1024, and besides in the habitual depiction of the globus cruciger the orb is always shown held by the full hand and all fingers, not just three.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>tempting</b> <b>to</b> {{think that}} the notion of {{function}} problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems. However, this is not really the case, since function problems can be recast as decision problems. For example, the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples (a,b,c) such that the relation a×b=c holds. Deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{military}} advice, {{the idea of}} China winning the war with Japan swiftly {{with only a few}} American men and planes was <b>tempting</b> <b>to</b> civilian leaders. It was adopted by top civilian officials including Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and President Roosevelt himself. However, the American attack never took place: The Nationalist Chinese had not built and secured any runways or bases close enough to reach Japan, just as {{the military}} had warned. The bombers and crews arrived after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, and were used for the war in Burma, as they lacked the range to reach Japan from the secure bases in China.|$|E
25|$|Morton Ann Gernsbacher, a {{professor}} of psychology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, compares the orientation of toilet paper to the orientation of cutlery in a dishwasher, the choice of which drawer in a chest of drawers to place one's socks, and the order of shampooing one's hair and lathering one's body in the shower. In each choice, there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority, and it is <b>tempting</b> <b>to</b> offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different. She warns that neuroimaging experiments—which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from mental rotation and facial expressions to grocery shopping and tickling—must strive to avoid such cultural bias and stereotypes.|$|E
25|$|Colorless beryl {{is called}} goshenite. The name {{originates}} from Goshen, Massachusetts, {{where it was}} originally discovered. Since all these color varieties are caused by impurities and pure beryl is colorless, it might be <b>tempting</b> <b>to</b> assume that goshenite is the purest variety of beryl. However, there are several elements that can act as inhibitors to color in beryl and so this assumption {{may not always be}} true. The name goshenite has been said to be on its way to extinction and yet it is still commonly used in the gemstone markets. Goshenite is found to some extent in almost all beryl localities. In the past, goshenite was used for manufacturing eyeglasses and lenses owing to its transparency. Nowadays, it is most commonly used for gemstone purposes and also considered as a source of beryllium.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1931, Bradman seriously {{contemplated}} playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington. The media in England and Australia hotly debated {{the consequences of a}} move that would end Bradman's Test career. Bradman was advised by the Board of Control that if he played cricket in England in 1932, it would be another breach of his 1930 tour contract and therefore he would not be considered for Test selection if he went ahead with the deal. Public opinion divided: Australian cricket could not afford to lose him and some thought he was selling his birthright, but {{at the height of the}} Depression, working-class people empathised with Bradman. The opportunity to earn over £1000 per annum was very <b>tempting</b> <b>to</b> a young man without a profession.|$|E
25|$|Hitler {{was intent}} on invading Poland, though Galeazzo Ciano warned this would likely lead to war with the Allies. Hitler {{dismissed}} Ciano's comment, predicting that instead that Britain and the other Western countries would back down, and he suggested that Italy should invade Yugoslavia. The offer was <b>tempting</b> <b>to</b> Mussolini, but at that stage a world war {{would be a disaster}} for Italy as the armaments situation from building the Italian Empire thus far was lean. Most significantly, Victor Emmanuel had demanded neutrality in the dispute. Thus when World War II in Europe began on 1 September 1939 with the German invasion of Poland eliciting the response of the United Kingdom and France declaring war on Germany, Italy did not become involved in the conflict. However, when the Germans incarcerated 183 professors from Jagiellonian University in Kraków on 6 November 1939, Mussolini personally intervened to Hitler against this action, leading to the freeing of 101 Poles.|$|E
25|$|To be acceptable, any {{rule of law}} must {{be capable}} of being applied consistently, thus a {{definition}} of the criteria for this qualitative analysis must be supplied. Let us assume a purely factual analysis as a starting point. A injures B and leaves him lying in the road. C is a driver who fails to see B {{on the road and}} by running over him, contributes to the cause of his death. It would be possible to ask for a detailed medical evaluation at a post mortem to determine the initial degree of injury {{and the extent to which}} B's life was threatened, followed by a second set of injuries from the collision and their contribution. If the first incident merely damaged B's leg so that he could not move, it is <b>tempting</b> <b>to</b> assert that C's driving must have been the more substantial cause and so represents a novus actus breaking the chain. Equally, if B was bleeding to death and the only contribution that the driving made was to break B's arm, the driving is not a novus actus and does not break the chain. But this approach ignores the issue of A's foresight.|$|E
