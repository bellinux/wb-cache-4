25|$|Motorists who {{recently}} had a vehicle MOT tested and disagree with {{the outcome of the}} inspection are entitled to an appeal against the decision. The appeal must be lodged with DVSA/DVA within 28 days of the original <b>test</b> <b>date</b> if the items in question are mechanical in nature, three months are allowed for corrosion issues, except for corrosion of brake discs, brake lines or the exhaust system. Mileage, or the lack thereof, incurred after the inspection has no relevance to the appeal even if the vehicle has not been used for several months after the test.|$|E
25|$|The {{agent is}} emptied and {{depressurized}} and the valve is removed. After a thorough {{internal and external}} visual inspection, the cylinder is filled with water, placed inside a safety cage, and pressurized to the specified test pressure (varies with the type, age, and cylinder material) for the specified time period. If no failure, bulges, or leaks are detected, the cylinder passes. The cylinder is then emptied of water and thoroughly dried, and labeled with the <b>test</b> <b>date</b> and company that performed the test. CO2 types have the test information stamped on the cylinder, all other types get a sticker {{on the back of}} the cylinder. Once dry, the units are recharged. Unlike the UK, the US does not rebuild extinguishers and replace valves at specific intervals unless parts are found to be defective, with the exception of halon. Halon types are often given new o-rings and valve stems at every internal maintenance to minimize any leakage potential.|$|E
500|$|Before any {{cylinder}} is filled, {{verification of}} {{inspection and testing}} dates and a visual examination for external damage and corrosion are required by law in some jurisdictions, and are prudent even if not legally required at other places. [...] Inspection dates can be checked {{by looking at the}} visual inspection label and the hydrostatic <b>test</b> <b>date</b> is stamped on the shoulder of the cylinder.|$|E

2500|$|The {{consensus}} view is {{that these}} are important, although Mamlet and VanDeVelde feel the scores [...] "don't count as much as people think they do." [...] There are many reports that admissions departments consider only the highest test results in different test subsections, sometimes called superscore results or superscoring, so if a student takes a standardized test during multiple sittings, for example, admissions officers consider the highest math and verbal scores, regardless of <b>test</b> <b>date.</b> Two sources in the Washington Post suggested that colleges routinely superscore the SAT test but rarely the ACT, possibly because of difficulty processing five separate rounded numbers.|$|E
