If true, it shows that Brus' motivations were not entirely altruistic. The Scots Colleges abroad were being used as training and staging areas for Scottish priests intended to enter Scotland {{in the wake of the}} invading army and play the most significant role in its reconversion. The failure of the invasion left them in place (without much work to do other than intelligence and conspiracy).|$|E
500|$|Although her {{research}} was progressing at Missouri, McClintock was {{not satisfied with}} her position at the University. She recalled being excluded from faculty meetings, and was not made aware of positions available at other institutions. In 1940, she wrote to Charles Burnham, [...] "I have decided that I must look for another job. As far as I can make out, {{there is nothing more}} for me here. I am an assistant professor at $3,000 and I feel sure <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> limit for me." [...] Initially, McClintock's position was created especially for her by Stadler, and might have depended on his presence at the university. McClintock believed she would not gain tenure at Missouri, even though according to some accounts, she knew she would be offered a promotion from Missouri in the spring of 1942. Recent evidence reveals that McClintock more likely decided to leave Missouri because she had lost trust in her employer and in the University administration, after discovering that her job would be in jeopardy if Stadler were to leave for Caltech, as he had considered doing. The university's retaliation against Stadler amplified her sentiments.|$|E
500|$|The {{topic of}} {{abortion}} is a prominent theme in [...] "Secrets". After discovering {{that she is}} pregnant, Lori asks Glenn to retrieve with emergency contraception pills from the pharmacy. Upon returning, an infuriated Maggie hands Lori her pills. Dale gently confronts her about her pregnancy when he sees that she becomes nauseated at the smell of cooking meat, and Lori explains that Rick is the biological father of the child. Writer Robert Kirkman opined that such assertions were [...] "wishful thinking". [...] "She was with those two men very close to each other. There was not a large span of time between her time with Shane and then Rick's return and her time with Rick. It's definitely {{up in the air}} and it’s not like there's a lot of paternity tests floating around out there." [...] Kirkman felt that he had to responsibly approach controversial issues from a neutral standpoint and insisted that abortion should warrant discussion, considering the circumstances. He stated: [...] "As far as the abortion stuff goes, it’s really just a matter of being realistic. These are the kinds of issues that people deal with in real life and in this situation I think <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> kind of thought process that Lori Grimes would be going through." ...|$|E

It is Valentine's Day, although the TGS cast and crew still have to work all night. Frank reveals that he hates Jenna when he always chooses to [...] "kill" [...] Jenna {{in a game of}} [...] "Marry, Boff, Kill". Frank believes that Jenna is [...] "phony", and Jenna tries many times to redeem herself with Frank, with reasons such as her participation in Vagina Day: [...] "a charity event founded by a group of celebrities who have for whatever reason never been asked to participate in The Vagina Monologues". Eventually, in her final confrontation with Frank, she farts, but Frank is happy, telling her <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first real thing she has done, and the two reconcile. Another game of [...] "Marry, Boff, Kill" [...] leads some of the writers into believing that Cerie (who has been having problems with her fiance Aris) has feelings for Kenneth when she chooses to [...] "boff" [...] him. The writers send the pair off to get candy for the night. Kenneth and Cerie take a walk around Rockefeller Center, and Cerie reveals that she is not attracted to Kenneth but tells him that he can tell the others that the two made out. However, Kenneth fails to convince the writers that he has done so when he shows them a pair of male underpants, which he claims belong to Cerie.|$|E

[...] On BBC's Newsnight, when Choudary was questioned about his role in the radicalisation of Michael Adebolajo, he denied any responsibility, and talked about such radicalisation as a means to an end. He stated that he believed that not many Muslims would disagree with what Adebolajo had said in his videoed statement.|$|E

2500|$|During 1963, Swiss theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar, also a Catholic, wrote {{a scathing}} {{critique}} of Escrivá's spirituality, describing Escrivá's method of {{religion as a}} form of [...] "integrism" [...] (also called [...] "Catholic integralism"), stating [...] "despite the affirmations of the members of Opus Dei that they are free in their political options, it is undeniable that its foundation is marked by Francoism, <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> 'law within which it has been formed'". In another essay, published the next year, von Balthasar characterized Opus Dei as [...] "an integrist concentration of power within the Church" [...] and the main motivation of integrism as [...] "imposing the spiritual with worldly means".|$|E

Right before the sale, Chicago writer Happy Palmer quoted Spalding about his plans to manage Kelly: [...] "Oh, tie him up, I guess, if he really is averse to playing here. He may have his ugly up, and I guess {{from the way he}} is holding out in his refusal to sign <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case. All right, though. I am willing, and if he keeps on in that spirit I’ll make him eat hay with his horses before he is much older. He has been mad long enough now, and it is pretty near time somebody was getting mad at this end of the line. One thing I can certainly predict and that is that if Mr. Mike Kelly does not sign a contract with Chicago pretty d--d quick, he will have cause to regret it. That is all." ...|$|E

The child may decide <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> preferred course, or he may rebel.

2500|$|The Irgun's {{activities}} were classed as terrorism by MI5. The Irgun {{has been viewed}} as a terrorist organization or organization which carried out terrorist acts. In particular the Irgun was branded a terrorist organisation by Britain, the 1946 Zionist Congress and the Jewish Agency. Begin argued that terrorists and freedom fighters are differentiated in that terrorists deliberately try to target civilians, and that the Irgun was not guilty of terrorism since it supposedly tried to avoid civilian casualties. At the events to mark the 60th anniversary of the attack, Benjamin Netanyahu, then chairman of Likud and Leader of the Opposition in the Knesset, opined that the bombing was a legitimate act with a military target, distinguishing it from an act of terror intended to harm civilians. He said, [...] "Imagine that Hamas or Hizbullah would call the military headquarters in Tel Aviv and say, 'We have placed a bomb and we are asking you to evacuate the area.' They don't do <b>that.</b> <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> difference." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} on All Things Considered, Yale University history professor Beverly Gage, {{who is writing a}} biography of Hoover, stated that the film accurately conveys that Hoover came to the FBI as a reformer seeking [...] "to clean it up, to professionalize it," [...] and to introduce scientific methods to its investigation, eventually including such practices as fingerprinting and bloodtyping. She praises DiCaprio for conveying the tempo of Hoover's speech. However, she notes that the film's central narrative device in which Hoover dictates his memoirs to FBI agents chosen as writers, is fictitious: [...] "He didn't ever have the sort of formal situation that you see in the movie where he was dictating a memoir to a series of young agents, and <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> official record of the FBI." [...] Historian Aaron J. Stockham of the Waterford School, whose dissertation was on the relationship of the FBI and the US Congress during the Hoover years, wrote on the History News Network of George Mason University, [...] "J. Edgar portrays Hoover as the man who successfully integrated scientific processes into law enforcement investigations.... There is no doubt, from the historical record, that Hoover was instrumental in creating the FBI's scientific reputation." [...] Stockham notes that Hoover probably did not write the FBI–King suicide letter to Martin Luther King, Jr., as the film portrays: [...] "While such a letter was written, Hoover almost certainly delegated it to others within the Bureau." ...|$|E
2500|$|Art Vandelay {{is first}} used in [...] "The Stake Out". George and Jerry invent {{an excuse to}} explain their {{presence}} in the lobby of an office building. They explain that they're meeting Art Vandelay, an importer-exporter who works in the building.

George later applies the name to a fictional problem boyfriend of Elaine, part of an elaborate cover story to hide from Susan that he's also dating Marisa Tomei ("The Cadillac"). George uses the name when asked which authors he reads during an interview with Elaine's publishing house in [...] "The Red Dot". In [...] "The Bizarro Jerry", George asks the receptionist at Brandt/Leland for a Mr. Art Vendelay, to which she replies, [...] "there's no Mr. Vandelay here". In [...] "The Serenity Now", George invents fake customers, one of whom is [...] "Mr. Vandelay", to hide his lack of sales success. In [...] "The Bizarro Jerry", George asks to see Mr. Vandelay as part of a ruse to approach an attractive secretary. In [...] "The Puerto Rican Day", George pretends to be Vandelay (Jerry pretends to be [...] "Kal Varnsen", and Kramer is [...] "H.E.

The Sermon when analysed on its own gives a restatement of the Law’s teaching with an even stricter interpretation.
