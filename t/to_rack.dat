Combined with the attention he received from his contract, Smith continued to be a national figure. Known as a savvy dresser, he made the April 1988 cover of GQ magazine. Smith was witness to change within the Cardinal organization when owner Gussie Busch died in 1989 and Herzog quit as manager during the 1990 season.|$|E
5|$|North Korean troops {{continued}} {{attacking the}} 24th Infantry all across its line, probing for weaknesses. On August 25 and 26, C Company beat off several more North Korean attacks on Battle Mountain coming along the long ridge extending from Tundok. At {{one point in}} these fights, a flight of US Air Force aircraft caught about 100 North Korean soldiers in the open and immediately napalmed, bombed, and strafed them. The North Korean force was destroyed with few survivors. Task Force Baker, comprising C Company and a platoon of E Company, 24th Infantry with an ROK police company, defended Battle Mountain at this time. The special command was established because of the isolated Battle Mountain area and the extended regimental battle front. For the next two days, air strikes continued <b>to</b> <b>rack</b> North Korean counterattacks and {{to prevent them from}} forming into any serious attack on Battle Mountain.|$|E
5|$|Overall, John II Komnenos {{left the}} empire {{a great deal}} better off than he had found it. Substantial territories had been recovered, and his successes against the invading Petchenegs, Serbs and Seljuk Turks, along with his {{attempts}} to establish Byzantine suzerainty over the Crusader States in Antioch and Edessa, did much to restore the reputation of his empire. His careful, methodical approach to warfare had protected the empire from the risk of sudden defeats, while his determination and skill had allowed him <b>to</b> <b>rack</b> up {{a long list of}} successful sieges and assaults against enemy strongholds. By the time of his death, he had earned near universal respect, even from the Crusaders, for his courage, dedication and piety. His early death meant his work went unfinished; historian Zoe Oldenbourg speculates that his last campaign might well have resulted in real gains for Byzantium and the Christian cause.|$|E

40|$|Phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma 1; EC 3. 1. 4. 11) hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate to {{generate}} diacylglycerol and inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate and is activated {{in response to}} growth factor stimulation and tyrosine phosphorylation. Concomitantly, the enzyme translocates from the cytosol to the particulate cell fraction. A similar process of activation-induced translocation from the cytosol to the cell particulate fraction has also been described for protein kinase C (PKC). We have previously shown that activated PKC binds to specific receptor proteins, receptors for activated C kinase, or RACKs, of approximately 30 kDa. Here, we show that PLC-gamma 1 bound <b>to</b> these <b>RACKs</b> and inhibited subsequent PKC binding <b>to</b> <b>RACKs.</b> However, unlike PKC, the binding of PLC-gamma 1 <b>to</b> <b>RACKs</b> did not require phospholipids and calcium. After epidermal growth factor treatment of intact A- 431 cells, the binding of PLC-gamma 1 <b>to</b> <b>RACKs</b> increased as compared with PLC-gamma 1 from control cells. This increase in PLC-gamma 1 binding <b>to</b> <b>RACKs</b> was due <b>to</b> the phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1. Additional data indicated that PLC-gamma 1 binds <b>to</b> <b>RACKs</b> in solution; epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent PLC-gamma 1 phosphorylation and activation decreased {{in the presence of}} RACKs. It is possible that, in vivo, PLC-gamma 1 associates with RACKs or with other PLC-gamma 1 -specific anchoring proteins in the particulate cell fraction. Since a PKC C 2 homologous region is present in PLC-gamma 1, the C 2 region may mediate the activation-induced translocation of the enzyme to the cell particulate fraction and the anchoring protein-PLC-gamma 1 complex may be the active translocated form of PLC-gamma 1...|$|R

25|$|Gagné {{used this}} deadly {{combination}} of pitches <b>to</b> <b>rack</b> up strikeouts {{at a very}} high rate. In his Cy Young-winning season of 2003, he had 100 more strikeouts (137) than hits he allowed (37). This produced a strikeout-to-hit ratio of 3.7, a single-season record for relief pitchers with 50 innings. He also has the highest percentage of swinging strikes as a percent of his total pitches (18.5%) among all pitchers since the 2002 season. He also owns the highest percentage of swinging strikes on pitches inside the strike zone.|$|E
25|$|After the {{starting}} bell rang at 3:15 pm, the Chicagos managed <b>to</b> <b>rack</b> up a 3-0 {{lead in the}} top of the first inning with one hit, two walks, two errors, and a sacrifice fly. The Browns narrowed the margin with a run in the second inning on some astute base running by Bill Gleason, with another run notched in the third inning when Tip O'Neill tripled home a runner. The tide turned decisively in the fifth inning when starting pitcher John Clarkson, pitching a second consecutive game, began to run out of gas, giving up a two-run single to center by Gleason, followed by an RBI single by Browns first baseman Charlie Comiskey.|$|E
25|$|Wilkinson {{played for}} England in matches against Australia, the United States and Canada as the 1999 Rugby World Cup approached. He made his Rugby World Cup debut against Italy, scoring one try, {{converting}} another six and landing five penalty goals <b>to</b> <b>rack</b> up 32individualpoints in the 67–7 win. After playing another pool {{game against the}} All Blacks, which England lost 30–16, he was rested against Tonga, a match won by England 101–10. Following the quarter-final playoff win against Fiji, Wilkinson was relegated to the bench for the quarter-final against South Africa. England lost the match by 44–21 and exited the tournament. Clive Woodward refused to expand on his selection choice at the time, and following the match some commentators blamed the head coach's lack of consistency in team selection as harming England's World Cup bid.|$|E

He makes Blair record a video taped {{confession}} of his illegal actions, then kills Blair and disposes of all forensic evidence of the agents' presence. Afterwards, he hunts down and kills Blair's remaining subordinates. Bowman and his closest friends begin to systematically kill ATF agents around the nation – whom Bowman views as supporting the infringement of citizen's constitutional rights, and abusing government powers – as well as politicians who had supported unconstitutional gun control legislation. Simultaneously Bowman releases the video tape of Blair to CNN, which claims that Blair and his companions have {{had a change of}} heart, realize what they are doing is wrong, and are now dedicated to killing other ATF agents. Amidst the national search for Blair and company, Bowman continues <b>to</b> <b>rack</b> up the body count.|$|E
25|$|Muster {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>rack</b> up clay-court {{victories in}} 1996. He won seven tournaments, {{six of them}} titles he successfully defended after winning them the year before. These 1996 tournament victories included his third Monte Carlo title, where he defeated clay court specialist Albert Costa in the final, and his third Italian Open title, defeating Richard Krajicek in the final. Muster's win-loss record on clay in 1996 was an impressive 46–3. This made his 1995–96 record on the surface 111–5, which was, at the time, the best two-year clay-court record since the open era began in 1968. Despite Muster's continued dominance on clay-courts in 1996, he was upset in the Round of 16 at the 1996 French Open, losing to eventual finalist Michael Stich. In July 1996, in {{the final of the}} 1996 Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, Muster defeated the French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov in three straight sets.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} home {{series against}} India saw Cook continue his fine Test form despite England not winning a Test. He {{was the third}} highest scoring Englishman {{with an average of}} 37. In the first Test, Cook made scores of 36 and 17 as the match ended in a draw. During {{the first day of the}} second Test at Trent Bridge, Cook became the youngest English player <b>to</b> <b>rack</b> up 1,500 Test runs eclipsing the record held by David Gower. In the first innings of the third Test, Cook made his biggest score of the series, 61 and followed this up with 43 in the second innings to help England secure a draw. Cook played in six of the seven ensuing one-day matches, scoring his maiden ODI century in the first match alongside Ian Bell's 126 not out guiding England to a 104 win victory that propped up England's first one-day series victory since 2005. After two ducks, Cook was dropped in the final, decisive match.|$|E

25|$|Despite all the changes, O'Neal {{spearheaded the}} Pacers to a league-best 61–21 {{record in the}} 2003–04 season. He {{remained}} a constant double-double threat, averaging 20.1 points and 10.0 rebounds a game in the regular season. He also continued <b>to</b> <b>rack</b> up individual honors, making his third All-Star trip and being named to the All-NBA Second Team. Artest was instrumental to the team's success too as he enjoyed a breakthrough season, netting his first All-Star berth {{as well as the}} NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. In the playoffs, Indiana gained revenge from the preceding season by sweeping Boston in the first round, before defeating the Miami Heat in the next. That sent them back to the Eastern Conference Finals for the sixth time in 11 years, where they were disposed of by eventual NBA champions Detroit Pistons. In the series-deciding Game 6, O'Neal endured a sprained knee and managed to tally 20 points and 10 rebounds, but Richard Hamilton's inspired play ensured a close victory for the Pistons.|$|E

25|$|The early 1980s saw the Sooners {{begin to}} slip under Switzer. They lost four games each in 1981, 1982, and 1983. It {{was the first}} time they lost four games in a season since 1970 under Coach Fairbanks. However, eight of those twelve losses came to the likes of USC, Texas, Nebraska and Ohio State. They began to turn things around in 1984 when they went 9–2–1 and {{finished}} the season at #6. The 1984 team featured Buster Rhymes at wide receiver, Spencer Tillman at running back and Tony Casillas at defensive tackle. Over the next three years, the team continued to grow and went 11–1 each year (with all three losses coming to Miami), including a national championship in 1985 (they finished ranked number three in 1986 and 1987). Many great Sooner athletes came through the program during these years, including two-time Butkus Award winner Brian Bosworth, tight end Keith Jackson and quarterback Jamelle Holieway. While Switzer was not able to match Wilkinson's unimaginable string of 13consecutive conference championships, he was able <b>to</b> <b>rack</b> up 12 of his own during his career at Oklahoma.|$|E

25|$|Pre-set hybrid {{triggers}} {{are similar}} to a DA/SA trigger in reverse. The first pull of the trigger is pre-set. If the striker or hammer fail to discharge the cartridge, the trigger may be pulled again and will operate as a double-action only (DAO) until the cartridge discharges or the malfunction is cleared. This allows the operator to attempt a second time to fire a cartridge after a misfire malfunction, {{as opposed to a}} single-action, in which the only thing to do if a round fails to fire is <b>to</b> <b>rack</b> the slide, clearing the round and recocking the hammer. While this can be advantageous in that many rounds will fire on being struck a second time, and it is faster to pull the trigger a second time than to cycle the action, if the round fails to fire on the second strike, the user will be forced to clear the round anyway, thus using up even more time than if they had simply done so in the first place. The Taurus PT 24/7 Pro pistol (not {{to be confused with the}} first-generation 24/7 which was a traditional pre-set) offered this feature starting in 2006. The Walther P99 Anti-Stress is another example.|$|E

On 10 January, Yorktown and the rest of TF 38 entered the South China Sea via Bashi Channel to begin a series of raids on Japan's inner defenses. On 12 January, her planes visited the vicinity of Saigon and Tourane (now named Da Nang) Bay, Indochina, in hopes of catching major units of the Japanese fleet. Though foiled in their primary desire, TF 38 aviators still managed <b>to</b> <b>rack</b> up an exceptional score – 44 enemy ships, of which 15 were combatants. On 15 January, raids were launched on Formosa and Canton in China. The following day, her aviators struck at Canton again and also went to Hong Kong. On 20 January, she exited the South China Sea with TF 38 via Balintang Channel. She participated in a raid on Formosa on 21 January and another on Okinawa on 22 January before clearing the area for Ulithi.
