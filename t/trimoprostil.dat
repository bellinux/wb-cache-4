40|$|We {{have studied}} the effects of <b>Trimoprostil,</b> a {{prostaglandin}} E 2 analogue, on human gastric acid and soluble mucus output using human subjects. This compound caused anti-secretory effects on both basal as well as histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion in a dose-dependent manner. There was a simultaneous increase in total mucus output. When the secreted mucus was fractionated by Sepharose CL- 2 B gel chromatography, most of the basal gastric mucin was shown {{to be in the}} polymeric form (mol wt 2 x 10 6), whereas after histamine stimulation the mucin was mostly in the subunit form (mol wt 0. 5 x 10 6). The gastric mucin, after stimulation using low doses of prostaglandin, was mainly in the polymeric form; but after high doses, the subunit form predominated. These observations are important in the understanding of physiological and pharmacological control of gastric mucus output with regard to its chemical composition and molecular heterogeneity, and provide further insight into the rational clinical use of the prostaglandins for gastroduodenal diseases. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
