5|$|A model {{suggests}} that Enceladus's salty ocean (-Na, -Cl, -CO3) has an alkaline pH of 11 to 12. The high pH is interpreted to be {{a consequence of}} serpentinization of chondritic rock that leads to <b>the</b> <b>generation</b> of H2, a geochemical source of energy that can support both abiotic and biological synthesis of organic molecules {{such as those that}} have been detected in Enceladus's plumes.|$|E
50|$|From below <b>the</b> <b>generations</b> are depicted. <b>The</b> ancestors, {{which are}} shown in the tree’s roots, bark and branches, create the {{foundation}} for <b>the</b> current <b>generation.</b> <b>The</b> current <b>generation</b> cares for and provides for the leaves and fruit, which depict <b>the</b> future <b>generations.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{preparation}} of L-ornithine and L-aspartate (LOLA) {{is used to}} increase <b>the</b> <b>generation</b> of urea through the urea cycle, a metabolic pathway that removes ammonia by turning it into the neutral substance urea. It may be combined with lactulose and/or rifaximin if these alone are ineffective at controlling symptoms.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} pathophysiological {{mechanism of}} leukemogenesis in AML is the epigenetic induction of dedifferentiation by genetic mutations that alter {{the function of}} epigenetic enzymes, such as the DNA demethylase TET2 and the metabolic enzymes IDH1 and IDH2, which lead to <b>the</b> <b>generation</b> of a novel oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as TET2. The hypothesis is that such epigenetic mutations lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and/or the activation of proto-oncogenes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{trend in}} {{contemporary}} Danish architecture is {{the emergence of}} a new generation of successful young practices, inspired more by international trends than by the modernist tradition in Scandinavia. <b>The</b> <b>generation</b> is spearheaded by Bjarke Ingels whose firm BIG (Bjarke Ingels Group) founded in 2006 has made an unusually rapid transition into a well-established firm.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> second <b>generation</b> had a mixed legacy {{affected}} by the video game crash of 1983. The Atari 2600 was discontinued on January 1, 1992, ending <b>the</b> second <b>generation.</b> <b>The</b> duration between the start of <b>the</b> 2nd <b>generation</b> in 1976 {{and the start of}} <b>the</b> 3rd <b>generation</b> in 1983 was seven years.

5|$|Attributed or {{imaginary}} arms {{appeared in}} {{literature in the}} middle of the 12th century, particularly in Arthurian legends. During <b>the</b> <b>generation</b> following Chrétien de Troyes, about 40 of Arthur's knights had attributed coats of arms (Pastoreau 1997a, 259). A second stage of development occurred during the 14th and 15th centuries when Arthurian arms expanded to include as many as 200 attributed coats of arms.|$|E
5|$|HIV {{differs from}} many viruses {{in that it}} has very high genetic variability. This {{diversity}} {{is a result of}} its fast replication cycle, with <b>the</b> <b>generation</b> of about 1010 virions every day, coupled with a high mutation rate of approximately 3 x 10−5 per nucleotide base per cycle of replication and recombinogenic properties of reverse transcriptase.|$|E

5|$|In glycolysis, glucose and {{glycerol}} are metabolized to pyruvate. Glycolysis generates two equivalents of ATP through substrate phosphorylation catalyzed by two enzymes, PGK and pyruvate kinase. Two equivalents of NADH {{are also}} produced, {{which can be}} oxidized via the electron transport chain and result in <b>the</b> <b>generation</b> of additional ATP by ATP synthase. The pyruvate generated as an end-product of glycolysis is a substrate for the Krebs Cycle.|$|E

50|$|Romanticism in Chile can be {{classified}} in three literary <b>generations,</b> according to <b>the</b> critic Cedomil Goic: <b>the</b> 1837 <b>generation,</b> <b>the</b> 1842 <b>generation</b> and <b>the</b> 1867 <b>generation,</b> <b>the</b> latter of which had many parallels with realism and is considered by some critics to actually {{be part of the}} realist movement.|$|R
5|$|Resistance welding {{involves}} <b>the</b> <b>generation</b> of heat {{by passing}} current through the resistance {{caused by the}} contact between two or more metal surfaces. Small pools of molten metal are formed at the weld area as high current (1000–100,000 A) is passed through the metal. In general, resistance welding methods are efficient and cause little pollution, but their applications are somewhat limited and the equipment cost can be high.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} in Dwarf Fortress is {{generating}} a playable world; only one game can be played per world at a time.

5|$|The motor {{system of}} the brain is {{responsible}} for <b>the</b> <b>generation</b> and control of movement. Generated movements pass from the brain through nerves to motor neurons in the body, which control the action of muscles. The corticospinal tract carries movements from the brain, through the spinal cord, to the torso and limbs. The cranial nerves carry movements related to the eyes, mouth and face.|$|E

5|$|The {{rotation}} {{of a star}} produces an equatorial bulge due to centrifugal force. As stars are not solid bodies, they can also undergo differential rotation. Thus the equator of the star can rotate at a different angular velocity than the higher latitudes. These differences {{in the rate of}} rotation within a star may have a significant role in <b>the</b> <b>generation</b> of a stellar magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Typically, {{conventional}} hydroelectricity complements {{wind power}} very well. When {{the wind is}} blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water. When the wind drops they can, provided they have <b>the</b> <b>generation</b> capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate. This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water.|$|E
