5|$|Plain milk was not {{consumed}} by adults except the poor or sick, being reserved for <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>young</b> or elderly, and then usually as buttermilk or whey. Fresh milk was overall less common than {{other dairy products}} {{because of the lack}} of technology to keep it from spoiling. Tea and coffee, both made from plants found in the Old World, were popular in East Asia and the Muslim world during the Middle Ages. However, neither of these non-alcoholic social drinks were consumed in Europe before the late 16th and early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} is {{generally}} mild and self-limiting with most symptoms generally improving in a week. Half of cases go away in 10days and 90% in 15days. Severe complications, if they occur, are {{usually in the}} very old, <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>young,</b> or those who are immunosuppressed. Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis, pharyngitis, or an ear infection. It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8% and ear infection in 30% of cases.|$|E
5|$|A {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) is an infection that affects part of the urinary tract. When it affects the lower urinary tract it {{is known as a}} bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the very old and <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>young,</b> symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E

5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care. One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, {{and there has been}} evidence to show that women are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers. Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and community work that women have to do. Because of the lack of care workers available, <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>young</b> and the very old have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E
5|$|Like all lifeforms, new {{strains of}} E. coli evolve through the natural {{biological}} processes of mutation, gene duplication, and horizontal gene transfer; in particular, 18% {{of the genome}} of the laboratory strain MG1655 was horizontally acquired since the divergence from Salmonella. E. coli K-12 and E. coli B strains are {{the most frequently used}} varieties for laboratory purposes. Some strains develop traits that can be harmful to a host animal. These virulent strains typically cause a bout of diarrhea that is often self-limiting in healthy adults but is frequently lethal to children in the developing world. More virulent strains, such as , cause serious illness or death in the elderly, <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>young,</b> or the immunocompromised.|$|E
5|$|Milk was an {{important}} source of animal protein for those who could not afford meat. It would mostly come from cows, but milk from goats and sheep was also common. Plain fresh milk was not consumed by adults except the poor or sick, and was usually reserved for <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>young</b> or elderly. Poor adults would sometimes drink buttermilk or whey or milk that was soured or watered down. Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products {{because of the lack of}} technology to keep it from spoiling. On occasion it was used in upper-class kitchens in stews, but it was difficult to keep fresh in bulk and almond milk was generally used in its stead.|$|E

5|$|The common {{blackbird}} of the nominate subspecies T. m. merula is 23.5 to 29centimetres (9.25 to 11.4in) in length, {{has a long}} tail, {{and weighs}} 80â€“125grams (2.8 to 4.4oz). The adult male has glossy black plumage, blackish-brown legs, a yellow eye-ring and an orange-yellow bill. The bill darkens somewhat in winter. The adult female is sooty-brown with a dull yellowish-brownish bill, a brownish-white throat and some weak mottling on the breast. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} female, but has pale spots on the upperparts, and <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>young</b> juvenile also has a speckled breast. Young birds vary in the shade of brown, with darker birds presumably males. The first year male resembles the adult male, but has a dark bill and weaker eye ring, and its folded wing is brown, rather than black like the body plumage.|$|E

25|$|While it {{may seem}} that fasting in the manner set forth by the Church is a strict rule, there are {{circumstances}} where a person's spiritual guide may allow an Economy because of some physical necessity (e.g. those who are pregnant or infirm, <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>young</b> and the elderly, or those who {{have no control over}} their diet, such as prisoners or soldiers).|$|E

40|$|Until recently, {{the best}} {{performing}} copying garbage collectors used a generational policy which repeatedly collects <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>youngest</b> objects, copies any survivors {{to an older}} space, and then infrequently collects the older space. A previous study that used garbage collection simulation pointed to potential improvements by using an Older-First copying garbage collection algorithm. The Older-First algorithm sweeps a fixed-sized window through the heap from older to younger objects, and avoids copying <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>youngest</b> objects which have not yet had sufficient time to die. We describe and examine here an implementation of the Older-First algorithm in the Jikes RVM for Java. This investigation shows that Older-First can perform {{as well as the}} simulation results suggested, and greatly improves total program performance when compared to using a fixed-size nursery generational collector. We further compare Older-First to a flexible-size nursery generational collector in which the nursery occupies all of the heap that does not contain older objects. In these comparisons, the flexible-nursery collector is occasionally the better of the two, but on average the Older-First collector performs the best...|$|R
