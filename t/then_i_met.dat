500|$|Beastie Boys {{were signed}} as the opening act, while record {{producer}} Patrick Leonard was the music director. [...] "At first I said, 'The {{girl in the}} underwear? Gedoudahere!'" [...] he recalled in 1992. [...] "But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> {{her and she was}} just this vicious thing. You know, right in your face with, 'This is what I need. The tour's three months long. Whaddo I know about a band? You do it.' So I said okay." ...|$|E
500|$|Björk was {{intending}} to have several producers {{work on the}} album, but this idea never came to fruition. Björk was then {{going to have the}} album produced with Paul Fox until she was introduced to producer Nellee Hooper by her boyfriend Dominic Thrupp. Hooper had previously produced albums by Soul II Soul, Sinéad O'Connor and Massive Attack, which made Björk skeptical about working with him, stating that [...] "I thought Nellee was too 'good taste' for my liking. But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him, got to know him, [...] got to hear about his fabulous ideas..." [...] Björk and Hooper's recording ideas were very similar, which led to the decision to end production work with Massey and Fox. Hooper introduced Björk to studio technology and studio programmer Marius de Vries who gave Debut a modern style with the use of keyboards and synthesizers. Hooper produced the first ten tracks on the album, while Björk co-produced [...] "Like Someone in Love" [...] with Hooper and produced [...] "The Anchor Song" [...] solely herself. Björk and Hooper spent many sessions in the studio working on Debut until the album was finished in early 1993.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking to Rolling Stone {{magazine}} in early 1979, {{by which time}} he and Arias were married and {{the parents of a}} newborn son, Dhani, Harrison further acknowledged Arias' positive influence on his life when discussing the despondency behind his Dark Horse song [...] "Simply Shady": [...] "I wasn't ready to join Alcoholics Anonymous or anything – I don't think I was that far gone – but I could put back a bottle of brandy occasionally, plus all the other naughty things that fly around. I just went on a binge... <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Olivia and it all worked out fine." [...] Other Harrison love songs dedicated to Arias include [...] "Dark Sweet Lady" [...] and [...] "Your Love Is Forever", both released on the 1979 album George Harrison.|$|E

60|$|Since <b>then</b> <b>I</b> have <b>met</b> Pyramids in {{the rooms}} of many friends of mine. They give him {{different}} names, but I am sure {{it is the same}} cat, I know those green eyes. He always brings them luck, but they are never quite the same men again afterwards.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that so? <b>Then</b> I'm glad <b>I</b> <b>met</b> you as <b>I</b> did, because I {{wanted to}} see you before you went away. I've got some strange news to tell you." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him in {{the club}} again. How he paid his fees there I do not know.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> {{him on the}} street, and he {{said that}} Persia was disintegrating, and took from me a dollar and a half.|$|E
60|$|CHLOE. I {{never gave}} a man away or did {{anything}} I was ashamed of--at least--I mean, I {{had to make}} my living {{in all sorts of}} ways, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Charlie.|$|E
6000|$|Hal smiled. 'At Bury, <b>then,</b> sure enough, <b>I</b> <b>met</b> {{my enemy}} Benedetto. He had painted {{a picture in}} plaster on the south wall of the Refectory--a noble place for a noble thing--a picture of Jonah.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{scarcely}} {{understood the}} meaning {{of it at the}} time; but since <b>then</b> <b>I</b> have <b>met</b> men, Indians and hunters, who have spent much time in the wilderness, who speak of [...] "bone yards" [...] which they have discovered, places where they can go at any time and be sure of finding a good set of caribou antlers. And they say that the caribou go there to die.|$|R
5000|$|By 1983, Creation Entertainment was {{the leading}} {{producer}} of comic book conventions nationwide. According to long-time comics editor Diana Schutz, [...] "Creation, at that time, used to run a comic book show virtually every weekend in {{some part of the}} country. It was <b>then</b> 1983 that <b>I</b> <b>met</b> my future [...] [...] [...] husband, Bob Schreck, who was working for Creation in those days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> you, {{talked to}} you that {{afternoon}} in the garden. Shall I make a complete confession? I wrote to Jennings Howe that very week that I could not marry him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Last night," [...] {{said the}} whisperer, hastily, [...] "I {{went for a}} quiet walk round Victoria Park all by myself. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Mr. Stokes, and we had one half-pint {{together}} at a public-house. That's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dandy's a darling, and wouldn't do {{anything}} of the sort if you asked him to. He's a kind little 'oss, as Thomas says. He only walked away when I got off to pick some roses, and I couldn't catch him. And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Jimmy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has nothing}} to do with Paul," [...] she assured him. [...] "Concerning him I will admit that I have had my weak moments. I think that those have passed. It was such a {{wonderful}} dream," [...] she went on reflectively, [...] "the dream of ruling the mightiest nation in the world, a nation that even now, after many years of travail, is only just finding its way through to the light. It seemed such a small thing that stood in the way. Since <b>then</b> <b>I</b> have <b>met</b> Paul's wife. She does not understand, but at least she loves." ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{attending}} {{classes at}} the Cork School of Music in 1984, Wright met Angela Desmond and, {{after he left the}} priesthood, they married in 1990. [...] "By the time I left the priesthood I hadn't seen her for a few years. <b>Then</b> in 1988 <b>I</b> <b>met</b> her again, by chance, and we met every day for a month and we haven't been apart since." [...] The Wrights live with their two children in County Cork, Ireland.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] muttered Peter, [...] "that Bob White {{has got a}} nest. I wish {{he would}} show it to me. He's terribly secretive about it. Last year I hunted for his nest until my feet were sore, but it wasn't the least bit of use. <b>Then</b> one morning <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Mrs. Bob White with fifteen babies out for a walk. How she could hide a nest with fifteen eggs in {{it is more than}} I can understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{tell you}} very much more, and no doubt you'll {{find out what you}} want to know for yourself. I spent a month {{shooting}} round his place in Western Canada, and made him promise if ever he came over he'd look in upon me here. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him in London a few weeks ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{the time}} does slip away!" [...] she sighed. [...] "But really, Dicky, I am late in your {{interests}} {{as much as}} anything. I have been paying a few calls. I {{went out to the}} Villa Rosa to see some people who almost live here, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Lady Crawley and she made me go in and have some tea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{afternoon}} I {{stepped into}} a nest of wasps, but the thoughtless creatures flew away without stinging me. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> a fierce tiger, and my heart grew light and gay. 'Surely this will cause me suffering!' I cried, and advanced swiftly upon the brute. But the cowardly tiger turned tail and ran {{to hide in the}} bushes, leaving me unhurt! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{understand}}--you can't," [...] he went on, [...] "but {{there it}} is. I {{never spoke to}} a woman until I spoke to Beatrice. Chance made me her friend. I began to understand the outside {{of some of those}} things which I had never even dreamed of before. She set me right in many ways. I began to read, think, absorb little bits of the real world. It was all wonderful. <b>Then</b> Elizabeth came. <b>I</b> <b>met</b> her, too, by accident--she came to my office for a house--Elizabeth!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{rules are}} {{the rules of the}} humble folk to whom I belong. All the same, I might have tried to use yours had I been my proper self. Well, perhaps I deserve some punishment. I'm poor and have no talent to help me along; I let Wolf use and cheat me like a schoolboy. <b>Then,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>met</b> you a few minutes since, I forgot about the men I'd lost. However, I'm going back to look for them and if I find them and some time get a proper job, we'll talk about my rashness again. I'll go to Don Pancho and state I mean to ask you to marry me. You'll no doubt refuse, but my {{proposal}} will be regular, and to refuse an offer I've some right to make won't humiliate you." ...|$|R
500|$|... "My {{makeup artist}} {{showed me the}} {{performance}} of Lorella Cuccarini a year ago, and it inspired me so much. <b>I</b> <b>then</b> <b>met</b> with the talented people who worked on it. The technology and concept were so genius. She was inspired after discovering Cuccarini's performance online. Thank God for YouTube or I would have never been exposed to something so inspiring. I never worked so hard on anything in my life as that performance for the Billboard Awards." ...|$|R
6000|$|The weeks {{went by and}} {{the days}} began to lengthen. Pretty yellow flowers that I had not seen before {{appeared}} in the woods, and I ate plenty of them; they have a nice flavour. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> another hare and loved her, because she {{reminded me of my}} sister. We used to play about together and were very happy. [...] "I wonder what she will do now that I am gone." ...|$|E
60|$|PURDIE. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Joanna. Yes! Foolishly, as I now see, I {{thought she}} would {{understand}} that I was far too deep a nature really to mean the little things I sometimes said to her. I suppose a man was never placed in such a position before. What was I to do? Remember, I was always certain that the ideal love could never come to me. Whatever the circumstances, I was convinced that my soul must walk alone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{my father}} died. He left me very badly off. I {{had to go}} and live with some old aunts in Yorkshire." [...] She shuddered. [...] "You will {{understand}} me when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had been. The narrowness, the deadly monotony of it, almost drove me mad." [...] She paused a minute, and added in a different tone: [...] "And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> John Cavendish." ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> tottered {{forth to}} think it over. <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Jeeves in the passage just outside.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} after the episode related in the last chapter and the {{discovery}} that a serpent was not necessarily dangerous to human beings, therefore a creature to be destroyed at sight and pounded to a pulp lest it should survive and escape before sunset, that I began to appreciate its unique beauty and singularity. <b>Then,</b> somewhat later, <b>I</b> <b>met</b> with an adventure which produced another and a new feeling in me, that sense of something supernatural in the serpent which {{appears to have been}} universal among peoples in a primitive state of culture and still survives in some barbarous or semi-barbarous countries, and in others, like Hindustan, which have inherited an ancient civilization.|$|R
6000|$|... "The trouble is, Tom, that I can't {{separate}} the two things. No sooner did Fan begin {{to speak to me}} again of him, telling me about his new changed life, and insinuating {{that it would be a}} gracious and noble thing in me to forgive him, than all the old feeling came back to me. I have fought against it with my whole strength, but what is reason against a feeling like that! And <b>then</b> most unhappily <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him by chance, and--and I gave him my hand and forgave him, and even called him by his Christian name as I had been accustomed to do. And now I feel that--I cannot resist him." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} in a burning fever, a moment since, and in some doubt what to do next. I became {{extremely}} cold now, and felt no doubt whatever. To show myself, after what I had heard, was impossible. To retreat--except into the fireplace--was equally out of the question. A martyrdom was before me. In justice to myself, I noiselessly arranged the curtains so that I could both see and hear. And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> my martyrdom, with the spirit of a primitive Christian.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{resolved}} to be a physician. I {{felt that he}} would not have died if he had been treated properly; the connection was obscure but powerful enough to consecrate me to the healing profession. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Dr. Sanborn. I love him and I couldn't live without him, but there is that figure back there--to have him and all that he means go out of my life would take part of my heart away." [...] Her voice had appeal in it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was Dunster, sir. I got {{a letter}} from him only five minutes ago, in which {{he said that he had}} painted Sammy--Sampson, the dog, sir, for a rag--for a joke, and that, as he didn't want anyone here to get into a row--be punished for it, I'd better tell Mr. Downing at once. I tried to find Mr. Downing, but he wasn't in the house. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Smith outside the house, and he told me that Mr. Downing had gone over to see you, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{tell the}} truth, I do. I saw him talking to Bertram Challoner, whom <b>I</b> <b>met</b> in London, {{and the family}} {{likeness}} struck me. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> saw {{his name in the}} hotel register." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dad, <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Jean Isbel. He {{came into}} my camp. Asked {{the way to the}} Rim. I showed him. We--we talked a little. And shore were gettin' acquainted when--when he told me who he was. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> left him--hurried back to camp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{long did}} it take you? I found it out before I ever spoke to her. <b>I</b> <b>met</b> her the other day in Saint Peter's; <b>I</b> knew it <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> knew it--do {{you want to know how}} long I have known it?" ...|$|R
