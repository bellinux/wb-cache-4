40|$|A {{distinctive}} feature of single layer graphene is the linearly dispersive energy bands, which {{in case of}} multilayer graphene become parabolic.

40|$|A {{physical}} description of low-field {{behavior of a}} Schottky source-gated <b>transistor</b> (SGT) is <b>outlined</b> where carriers crossing the source barrier by thermionic emission are restricted by JFET action in the pinch-off region at the drain end of the source. This mode of operation leads to transistor characteristics with low saturation voltage and high output impedance {{without the need for}} field relief {{at the edge of the}} Schottky source barrier and explains many characteristics of SGT observed experimentally. 2 -D device simulations with and without barrier lowering due to the Schottky effect show that the transistors can be designed so that the current is independent of source length and thickness variations in the semiconductor. This feature together with the fact that the current in an SGT is independent of source-drain separation hypothesizes the fabrication of uniform current sources and other large-area analog circuit blocks with repeatable performance even in imprecise technologies such as high-speed printing. © 1963 - 2012 IEEE...|$|R

30|$|The {{light output}} is {{detected}} by calibrating an integrating sphere with Si photodiode {{on the package}} device. The intensity-current (L-I) characteristics of the LEDs with and without PQC structure are shown in Figure  4 b. At an injection current of 20 mA and peak wavelength of 460 nm for TO (<b>transistor</b> <b>outline)</b> can package, the light output powers of conventional LED, LED with PQC on p-GaN surface, LED with PQC on n-side roughing, and LED with PQC structure on p-GaN surface and n-side roughing on TO can are given by 11.6, 13.5, 15.1, and 16.5 mW, respectively. Hence, the enhancement percentages of LED with PQC on p-GaN surface, LED with PQC on n-side roughing, and LED with PQC structure on p-GaN surface and n-side roughing were 16 %, 30 %, and 42 %, respectively, {{compared to that of}} the conventional LED. The higher enhancement of LED with both PQC structures was scattering and guiding light from LED top surface and n-side roughing onto the LED top direction [14, 21, 24] to increase more light output power. In addition, the corresponding wall-plug efficiencies (WPE) of conventional LED, LED with PQC on p-GaN surface, LED with PQC on n-side roughing, and LED with PQC structure on p-GaN surface and n-side roughing were 19 %, 22 %, 24 %, and 26 %, respectively, which addresses a substantial improvement by the PQC structures on top surface and n-side roughing as well at a driving current of 20 mA. Comparing with the conventional LED, the WPEs of LED with PQC on p-GaN surface, LED with PQC on n-side roughing, and LED with PQC structure on p-GaN surface and n-side roughing were increased by 15.8 %, 26.3 %, and 36.8 %, respectively, at an injection current of 20 mA, The enhancement of WPE of LED with PQC structure on p-GaN surface and n-side roughing is relatively high comparing with other researches [10, 13, 14, 24, 25], which is because the light emitted from LED scattered by top PQC pattern and guided onto the LED top direction by n-side roughing [22, 23, 26], therefore resulting in the enhancement of WPE.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} multifunctional MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical System) sensor system for the simultaneous measurement of pressure and temperature inside a hydraulic system, more specifically a hydraulic brake system for automotive applications. The multifunctional pressure and temperature sensor system presented in this Thesis was designed to be installed in a new brake-by-wire system that requires the simultaneous reading of pressure and temperature per wheel cylinder. This system needs to control and monitor these parameters at each wheel cylinder to adjust the pressure for optimal braking. Current sensing systems installed in regular brake systems use a single pressure sensor that is positioned in the main cylinder and they do not include a temperature sensor. Moreover, while numerous approaches have been taken to control and monitor the pressure in a brake system real-time, no MEMS sensor system has yet been reported that can carry out real-time measurements of the brake system's pressure and temperature. 	In a representative automobile hydraulic brake system, the pressure and temperature can reach up to about 4 Mpa and 120 °C, respectively. These conditions are developed in an oily environment with a pH ~ 11. The multifunctional sensor system presented here is based on the two sensors, one for pressure and one for temperature, working within the same packaging. These two sensors are glued on the surface of an adequate <b>Transistor</b> <b>Outline</b> (TO) base using a temperature resistance adhesive. The substrate with the two sensors is covered by a parylene layer for dielectric protection, protection from the corrosive medium and protection from the moisture inherent in the brake fluid. The interface of the sensor system to the hydraulic brake system uses a commercial 1 / 4 18 NPT fitting customized to serve as an interface as well as a metal shell between the sensor and the hydraulic cylinder. The TO base and the metal shell were joined by micro-brazing to minimize heat-affected areas and ensure that critical components are unharmed. A finite element model to understand the effect of the parylene layer on the performance of the sensors was developed using COMSOL Multiphysics®. The model was validated by testing many prototypes of the developed sensor system using a custom made hydraulic hand pump which pressure is monitored by a digital hydraulic pressure gauge. The sample fitting is covered by a coil heater that includes a type -T Thermocouple positioned close to the sample to monitor the temperature. The complete apparatus allowed characterization of the test sensor from room pressure (13 psi) to 500 psi over a temperature range of 25 to 120 °C. The test samples were characterized from atmospheric pressure to 450 psi over a temperature range of 25 to 120 °C. The experimental data shows a reduction in pressure sensitivity of 18. 2 % due to the parylene layer which closely agrees with the model predictions of a reduction of 21 %. In summary, a multifunctional sensor system has been developed {{that can be used to}} control and monitor the pressure and temperature of a hydraulic cylinder real-time. The sensor system is novel in that it measures both parameters at a single point real-time with good sensitivity and accuracy making it ideal for applications in brake-by-wire systems...|$|E
40|$|Wire bonding failures, {{including}} non-stick on die pad (bond-off) and smash ball of {{the first}} bond, are often encountered in manufacturing of miniaturized packages with increased feature density and higher UPH requirement. Many researches have been conducted with an attempt to solve these issues. However, these studies mainly focused on the correlations between bonding pad qualities and robust ball bonding solutions. Few of them investigated these failures from a mechanical point of view, such as deflection of leadframe under vertical bonding force. For today's small <b>outline</b> <b>transistor</b> (SOT) packages, the leadframe has low profiles and complex structures, which makes the wire bonding response very complex and difficult to be predicted. This paper demonstrated that the deflection of leadframe at the first bond position {{played an important role}} on the bond-off failure for SOT packages. When the deflection was larger than 5 μm at critical bonding locations, severe bond-off failure occurred. By applying finite element analysis, some ways to reduce this deflection thus eliminating the risk of bond-off failure were discussed and verified by experiments, which include leadframe structure modification at some local areas, change of supporting tape types, and lowering of bonding temperature. This work provides several guidelines for leadframe designers to achieve an optimized leadframe design of miniaturized packages, for the sake of improving wire bonding performances. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{maximize}} product throughput, {{an increasing number}} of electronic packages, such as Small <b>Outline</b> <b>Transistor</b> (SOT) package, are manufactured in a package array mold. Due to the complicated structure design of the package and mold cavity, wire sweep is becoming an increasingly severe problem. In this study, the numerical model which had been validated by experimental work was used for wire sweep analysis. Firstly, the leadframe structure was studied. Given the thin thickness of leadframe and the relative position to the bond wire loop, the leadframe structure has very limited influence on the wire sweep value. Besides, for fixed width and length of the die, the wire sweep behavior was simulated to examine the influence of the die height (thickness). The results show that the thinner the die, the smaller the wire sweep. Furthermore, the effect of cavity height on wire sweep value was also estimated. Based on the previous simulation and analyses, the ratio of the die height to that of the cavity was introduced as an index to optimize the flow pattern of epoxy molding compound (EMC) in order to find a guideline for package and cavity design to avoid the wire sweep issue. In addition, the influence of injection velocity and viscosity of EMC on wire sweep during transfer molding process were inspected and discussed according to the simulation results as well. It can be further concluded that the velocity plays the key role in resulting in the severe wire sweep in package array mold during transfer molding process. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Small <b>outline</b> <b>transistor</b> (SOT) packages, {{because of}} their low cost and low profile, are widely used in {{consumer}} electronics. Ni/Fe alloy (A 42) is {{the most widely used}} leadframe material of SOT packages because of its good formability and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) match with silicon die. The very small size of SOT packages allow a higher package density on a board, but the small size and close proximity of SOT packages make thermal management difficult. The low thermal conductivity of A 42, which is less than one tenth of that of copper, makes the thermal conduction even more difficult. Thus, the method of copper plating on A 42 leadframe is used to enhance the thermal conductivity of SOT packages while keeping their low cost and good CTE match between leadframe and silicon die. In this paper, the junction temperature T-j, the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance theta(j-a) and the junction-to-solder joint thermal resistance theta(j-sp) are used to evaluate the heat dissipating ability of the package. The finite element method is applied to study the influence of copper plating thickness on the thermal performance of a SOT package. A thermal resistance circuit model and the corresponding thermal resistance expression on function of the copper plating thickness are then proposed to quantify the influence of copper plating thickness. The proposed expression, which follows a hyperbolic form, can well predict thermal resistance of the model. Finally, die cracking issue of the SOT packages with copper leadframe is examined and the residual stress on silicon die after die bonding process is studied. By comparing the cracking pattern and the stress state, shear fracture is proposed to be the crack initiation mechanism. Results also show that copper plating on A 42 leadframe has little influence on the distribution of the thermal residual stress in the die. The stress level for the SOT package with copper plated A 42 leadframe is much lower than that with copper leadframe, which makes the die cracking risk much lower...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{circuit boards}} can {{experience}} rapid loading through shock or vibration events during their lives; these events {{can happen in}} transportation, manufacture, or in field conditions. Due to the lead-free migration, {{it is necessary to}} evaluate how this rapid loading affects the durability of a leading lead free solder alternative (Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu) assemblies as compared with traditional eutectic lead based solder Sn 37 Pb assemblies. A literature review showed that there is little agreement on the fatigue behavior of Sn 37 Pb solder assemblies and Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder assemblies subjected to rapid loading. To evaluate the failure behavior of Sn 37 Pb and Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder assemblies under rapid loading conditions, leadless chip resistors (LCR), ball grid arrays (BGA), small outline integrated circuits (SOIC), and small <b>outline</b> <b>transistors</b> (SOT) were subjected to four point bend tests via a servo-hydraulic testing machine at printed wiring board (PWB) strain rates greater than 0. 1 /s. The PWB strain was the metric used to evaluate the failures. The PBGAs and LCRs were examined with both Sn 37 Pb and Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu solders. There was no significant difference found in the resulting test data for the behavior of the two solder assembly types in the high cycle fatigue regime. PBGA assemblies with both solders were also evaluated at a higher strain rate, approximately 1 /s, using drop testing. There was no discernable difference found between the assemblies as well as no difference in the failure rate of the PBGAs at this higher strain rate. The PWB strain was converted to an equivalent solder stress index using finite element analysis. This equivalent stress index value was used to compare the results from the LCR and BGA testing for Sn 37 Pb and Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu. Independently generated BGA data that differed with respect to many testing variables was adjusted and incorporated to this comparison. The resulting plot did not show any significant differences between the behaviors of the two solder assemblies under rapid loading outside of the ultra low cycle fatigue regime, where the assemblies with Sn 37 Pb solder outperformed the assemblies with SnAgCu solder...|$|R

Due to the complicated structure design of the package and mold cavity, wire sweep is becoming a severe problem. In the study, the numerical model was firstly validated by experimental work using short shots experiment and X-ray technology. Then the verified model was employed for flow pattern and wire sweep analysis. The leadframe detail structure effects were evaluated at first. The effects of leadframe detail structure on flow pattern and wire sweep are insignificant and may be ignored, most likely due to the thin thickness of leadframe and the relatively lower position to the bond wire loop. Besides, for fixed width and length of the die, the wire sweep behavior was predicted by simulation to estimate the influence of the die height (thickness). The results show that the thinner the die, the smaller the wire sweep. Furthermore, the effect of cavity height on wire sweep value was also evaluated. Then, the ratio of the die height to that of the cavity was introduced as an index to investigate the main factors which influence the wire sweep values and propose a guideline for package and cavity design to reduce the wire sweep. It can be further concluded that velocity is more sensitive to the change of the package and cavity structures, compared with the viscosity. Next, a new design of industry package array mold was introduced for wire sweep study with the practical transfer molding process conditions. It shows the sharply increased velocity is the essential reason for the wire sweep issue at the vent side of the mold, due to the unbalanced flow of EMC. In order to address the issue, the transfer mold process optimization with transfer profile was carried out.
