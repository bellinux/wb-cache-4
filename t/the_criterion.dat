5|$|Scholars use {{a number}} of criteria, such as <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> of {{independent}} attestation, <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> of coherence, and <b>the</b> <b>criterion</b> of discontinuity to judge the historicity of events. The historicity of an event also depends on {{the reliability of the}} source; indeed, the gospels are not independent nor consistent records of Jesus' life. Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate. John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered less reliable, although more and more scholars now also recognize that it may contain a core of older material as historically valuable as the Synoptic tradition or even more so.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, {{the video}} {{distribution}} company <b>The</b> <b>Criterion</b> Collection, {{in collaboration with}} the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ Film Archive, began the restoration of the original negatives of the Apu trilogy, including Pather Panchali. These negatives had been severely damaged by a fire in London in 1993, and all film cans and fragments belonging to the Ray films were sent to the Motion Picture Academy for storage, where they lay unseen for two decades. It was discovered upon reexamination that, although many parts of the films were indeed destroyed by fire or the effects of age, other parts were salvageable. The materials were shipped to a restoration laboratory in Bologna, Italy: L’Immagine Ritrovata. Over a thousand hours of labor by hand were expended in restoring and scanning the negatives and, in the end, about 40 percent of the Pather Panchali negative was restored. (For those parts of the negative that were missing or unusable, duplicate negatives and fine-grain masters from various commercial or archival sources were used.) <b>The</b> <b>Criterion</b> Collection’s own lab then spent six months creating the digital version of all three films, at times choosing to preserve the distinctive look of the films even at the cost of retaining some imperfections.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the methods of}} the subjective approach in determining <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> weights. <b>The</b> compensatory and noncompensatory methods for determining <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> weights are briefly summarized. Determining <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> weight using pairwise comparisons and rankings is elaborated in detail. Possible ways of determining <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> weight in a group environment are presented in {{the last part of}} the paper. A subjective approach includes an impact of the decision maker on <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> weights, and therefore on the final solution of multicriteria problems. In contrast to the objective approach, some methods of the subjective approach do not require the existence of a decision matrix. The main aim of this paper is a systematic review of possible ways of determining <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> weights by <b>the</b> decision maker or more participants in the decision process...|$|R
40|$|When a {{phenomenon}} is getting complicated, acquiring more particular features or aspects, {{it is becoming}} more difficult to determine the relationships between <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> describing it. In this case, it is hardly possible to determine <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> weights based on expert evaluation. Moreover, the question arises if the statement that <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> describing a complicated phenomenon are interrelated as {{the elements of a}} single system is true. A comprehensive analysis shows that only hierarchically structured system of criteria can adequately describe a complicated phenomenon (CP). This system accounts for the variation of <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> relationships, when <b>the</b> number of parameters of the phenomenon is growing. The direct relationship can be observed only between <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> of <b>the</b> same set describing a particular CP aspect, while indirect relationship can be found between <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> describing various CP aspects. This implies that there is a connection characterized by direct relationship between the aggregated magnitudes pertaining to <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> considered. <b>The</b> paper offers a method of structuring a system of CP criteria, allowing us to determine the significance of <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> based on direct relationship between them...|$|R

50|$|Best Worst Method (BWM) is a multi-criteria {{decision-making}} (MCDM) method {{which was}} proposed by Dr. Jafar Rezaei in 2015. The method {{is used to}} evaluate a set of alternatives {{with respect to a}} set of decision <b>criteria.</b> <b>The</b> BWM is based on a systematic pairwise comparison of <b>the</b> decision <b>criteria.</b> That is, after identifying <b>the</b> decision <b>criteria</b> by <b>the</b> decision-maker (DM), two criteria are selected by the DM: <b>the</b> best <b>criterion</b> and <b>the</b> worst <b>criterion.</b> <b>The</b> best <b>criterion</b> is <b>the</b> one which has the most important role in making the decision, while <b>the</b> worst <b>criterion</b> has <b>the</b> opposite role. The DM then gives his/her preferences of <b>the</b> best <b>criterion</b> over all <b>the</b> other <b>criteria</b> and also his/her preferences of all <b>the</b> <b>criteria</b> over <b>the</b> worst <b>criterion</b> using a number from a predefined scale (e.g. 1 to 9). These two sets of pairwise comparisons are used as input for an optimization problem, the optimal results of which are the weights of <b>the</b> <b>criteria.</b> <b>The</b> salient feature of the BWM is that it uses a structured way to generate the pairwise comparisons which leads to reliable results.|$|R
