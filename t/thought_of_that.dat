[...] "When they were mixing it, we were sitting around and Bob Johnston came in and said, 'What {{do you want to}} call this?' And [...] just like said them out one at a time... Free association and silliness, I'm sure, played a big role." [...] Another Dylan chronicler, Oliver Trager, notes that besides spelling out the initials of Dylan's first name, the album title is also a riff on Brecht on Brecht, a stage production based on works by German playwright Bertolt Brecht that had influenced his early songwriting. Dylan himself has said of the title: [...] "Well, I don't even recall exactly how it came up, but I know it was all in good faith... I don't know who <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> I certainly didn't." ...|$|E

500|$|Having {{represented}} Wales at schoolboy level, Keenor {{was invited}} to attend a trial at Cardiff City by his former school teacher Riden, who had spotted Keenor playing local amateur football for Cardiff based side Roath Wednesday. Keenor later stated that he [...] "did not think twice about it" [...] and impressed enough during a trial match to be offered an amateur contract with the club {{at the age of}} 17. The Cardiff City amateur side competed in the Western Football League at the time and Keenor appeared several times in the division. A defeat to Camerton during a Western League fixture would leave a lasting effect on Keenor after an over-confident Cardiff side suffered an upset, losing 3–1 in a match they were widely expected to win. Keenor often spoke of using the defeat as motivation in later stages of his career, remarking [...] "In subsequent seasons I always <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> game when {{we were supposed to be}} on a [...] "good thing". It has a moral which I pass on to every young footballer".|$|E

On February 22, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account a link to a 29-second clip of the song, while calling Martin [...] "amazing". In an interview with Rolling Stone, Spears stated that the song's signature whistle gets her [...] "every time [...] hears it", adding that Martin's melodies are [...] "Incredible... Who would have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>that?</b> There is nobody I feel more comfortable collaborating with in the studio." [...] Kotecha told Digital Spy in May 2011 that the song was likely a contender for third single due to positive reaction. On May 11, 2011, a poll was launched on Britney.com in which fans could choose the third single of the album. Two days later, [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] was officially announced as the third single from Femme Fatale by Jive Records through a press release after winning the poll. [...] The cover art was revealed on June 6, 2011, and featured Spears on set of the music video, wearing colored hair extensions and a top with a skeletal Mickey Mouse.|$|E
500|$|The Epsom Derby {{occurred}} on 18 May and {{was attended by}} [...] "as numerous a company as ever appeared on the course." [...] Eleven horses lined up for the start, seven of them sired by Pot-8-Os.

Waxy pushed Brother to Precipitate (a [...] "bump" [...] in modern racing terms) at the track's first turn, taking and maintaining the lead to become an [...] "easy winner" [...] of the Derby. Three of the top four finishers were sired by Pot-8-Os, with second-place finisher Brother to Precipitate being the exception. The meeting was also notable for a [...] "dreadful accident," [...] a collision between a servant on horseback with the colt Exiseman, the winner of the race after the Derby, and for the antics of John Lade dressed in a [...] "loose undress of blue and white striped trowsers" [...] asking the crowd to determine whether he was [...] "the captain of a privateer or an ambassador from the Great Mogul." ...|$|E

500|$|On 2 May, Benfica {{visited the}} new Estádio José Alvalade for a match that decided {{who would go}} to the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League. Sporting pressed hard from the start and {{dominated}} the first half, but Benfica managed to balance the game in the second, until they finally beat Sporting's defence with an 87th-minute goal. Rui Dias described the goal for Record: [...] "It wasn't until the 87th minute that the game knew its man of the match: Geovanni; if the game was destined to be generic, the Brazilian added inspiration and scored a spectacular goal that decided the game and almost certainly sealed the unthinkable second place for Benfica – who could have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> only a month ago?." [...] With the win, Benfica were only a point short of qualifying for the Champions League. Camacho praised the team, saying they had had a fantastic season. A week later, Benfica secured the second place in the league and the associated place in the third qualifying round of the Champions League with a 0–0 home draw against União de Leiria. Camacho later said: [...] "We finished in second place, because we did not give up.". Benfica's last game of the season was the 2004 Taça de Portugal Final. In a highly competitive match, Porto took the lead through Derlei on the 45th minute, before Benfica equalized by Fyssas on the 58th minute. In extra-time, Simão scored the winner, sealing Benfica's 24th Portuguese Cup. It was the first trophy for the team since 1996, ending the club longest drought. Camacho complimented his team, and dedicated the win to Fehér and Bruno Baião, a youth team player who had died the day before, also from heart related complications. In the post-season, although Camacho said he was preparing for the following season, he chose to depart to Real Madrid on 24 May, as he signed a 2-year deal.|$|E

She had unsuccessfully stood for leadership of the BBI group after their landslide victory in April 2007. It has four councillors on Boston Borough Council.

[...] The group criticised the record of the BBI, including their approval of the Lincolnshire County Council Transport Strategy for Boston. A deal with the county council was struck to aid the BBI with the bypass proposal if they agreed not to stand in the next county council elections, prompting two councillors to resign. The chairman of the Boston Bypass Pressure Group also called on Cllr Austin and his deputy, Cllr Peter Jordan to resign over the deal with Lincolnshire Council. Both Cllrs Austin and Jordan vigorously denied any such deal and there were four BBI candidates in the subsequent County Council elections in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|News {{circulated}} {{within the}} capital that Querétaro had fallen. Upon his capture Maximilian wrote to Anton von Magnus, the Prussian minister to Mexico residing in Mexico City, {{and called for}} him to go to his prison and provide legal counseling before his trial. The Austrian commanders was suspicious and <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> letter as a falsified one and wasn't conveyed by the telegraph. Avoiding a possible trick they asked the Prussian Baronto to find out the truth behind the courrier by indirectly requesting the Emperor to send a hand-written signed letter to clarify his will on the continuation of military matters. After local merchants confirmed the arrest of the Emperor, Colonel Kodolitsch declared and insisted that the foreign troops would continue to defend the city no matter what. On the 17th, Baron Eduard Lago, the Austrian chargé d'affaires, who had been released Querétaro on 2 June and returned to Tacubaya on the 16th, sent a mail on the same day to Colonel Khevenhüller, in which he assured to obtain a signed letter from the Emperor that ordered all officers of Austrian nationality to abstain from any further bloodshed. The Austrians were then convinced of its reliability and decided to cease hostilities immediately and asked Lago for mediation at Díaz. They insisted though to all their military honours, their neutrality, and protection, required to be escorted on the retreat of their troops to Vera Cruz, and assurance of their maintenance until their embarquement at the said port.

2500|$|An {{empirical}} {{concept is}} the abstract <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> which {{is common to}} several perceptions. [...] When an empirical concept is said to contain an object, whatever is thought in the concept must be intuited in the mental representation of the object. Examples of intuitive perceptions that are the content of empirical concepts are vague images that are imagined in order to connect a concept with the perceptions from which it was derived as their common feature. [...] "Intuitions," [...] Kant wrote, [...] "are always required to verify or demonstrate the reality of our concepts." [...] These examples ensure that [...] "our abstract thinking has not strayed far from the safe ground of perception, and has possibly become somewhat high-flown or even a mere idle display of words." [...] This is because [...] "concepts are quite impossible, and are utterly without meaning or signification, unless an object is given for the concepts themselves, or {{at least for the}} elements of which they consist." [...] For example, [...] "The concept of a dog signifies a rule according to which my imagination can trace, delineate, or draw a general outline, figure, or shape of a four-footed animal without being restricted to any single and particular shape supplied by experience." [...] In order to prevent the emptiness of [...] "thoughts without contents," [...] it is [...] "necessary to make our concepts sensible, i.e., to add an object of intuition to them." [...] In order to [...] test whether a concept is sensible, we sometimes [...] " [...] … go back to perception only tentatively and for the moment, by calling up in imagination a perception corresponding to the concept that occupies us at the moment, a perception that can never be quite adequate to the (general) concept, but is a mere representative of it for the time being. … Kant calls a fleeting phantasm of this kind a schema." ...|$|E
