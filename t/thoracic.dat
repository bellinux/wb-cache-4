5|$|The {{nervous system}} in beetles {{contains}} all the types found in insects, varying between different species, from three <b>thoracic</b> and {{seven or eight}} abdominal ganglia which can be distinguished to that {{in which all the}} <b>thoracic</b> and abdominal ganglia are fused to form a composite structure.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe's neck {{vertebrae}} have {{ball and}} socket joints. In particular, the atlas–axis joint (C1 and C2) allows the animal to tilt its head vertically and reach more branches with the tongue. The point of articulation between the cervical and <b>thoracic</b> vertebrae of giraffes is shifted to lie {{between the first and}} second <b>thoracic</b> vertebrae (T1 and T2), unlike most other ruminants where the articulation is between the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) and T1. This allows C7 to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T1 is actually C8, and that giraffes have added an extra cervical vertebra. However, this proposition is not generally accepted, as T1 has other morphological features, such as an articulating rib, deemed diagnostic of <b>thoracic</b> vertebrae, and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven cervical vertebrae are generally characterised by increased neurological anomalies and maladies.|$|E
5|$|Up {{to three}} <b>thoracic</b> {{segments}} may be fused {{with the head}} to form a cephalothorax; the associated appendages turn forward and are modified as maxillipeds (accessory mouthparts). A carapace may be absent, present or secondarily lost, and may cover the head, part {{or all of the}} thorax and some of the abdomen. It is variable in form and may be fused dorsally with some of the <b>thoracic</b> segments or occasionally be in two parts, hinged dorsally. Typically, each of the <b>thoracic</b> appendages is biramous and the endopods are the better developed of the branches, being used for crawling or grasping. Each endopod consist of seven articulating segments; the coxa, basis, ischium, merus, carpus, propodus and dactylus. In decapods, the claw is formed by the articulation of the dactylus against an outgrowth of the propodus. In some taxa, the exopods are lost and the appendages are uniramous.|$|E
5|$|With {{the spread}} of {{cardiovascular}} surgery in India, the annual scientific meeting of the <b>thoracic</b> and cardiovascular surgeons was held independently in 1985 under the new title Association of <b>Thoracic</b> and Cardiovascular Surgeons of India. In 1990 the Indian Association of Cardiovascular-thoracic Surgeons was registered at Bombay. On 15 June 1991, the Association of <b>Thoracic</b> and Cardiovascular Surgeons of India was dissolved through a unanimous resolution passed by its general body during its annual meeting in Bombay, and its entire membership, funds, and assets were transferred to the new Association of Cardiovascular-thoracic Surgeons. Panday was elected as {{the first president of}} the latter society on 15 June 1991. The following year, the Fellowship of the Association (F.I.A.C.S) was instituted and regular biannual publication of the Journal of the Indian Association of Cardiovascular-thoracic Surgeons commenced.|$|E
5|$|At {{each level}} of the spinal column, spinal nerves branch off from {{either side of the}} spinal cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to {{innervate}} a specific part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome, and the group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a myotome. The part of the spinal cord that was damaged corresponds to the spinal nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), <b>thoracic</b> 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person's level of injury is defined as the lowest level of full sensation and function. Paraplegia occurs when the legs are affected by the spinal cord damage (in <b>thoracic,</b> lumbar, or sacral injuries), and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected (cervical damage).|$|E
5|$|In {{many groups}} of crustaceans, the fertilised eggs are simply {{released}} into the water column, while others have developed a number of mechanisms for {{holding on to the}} eggs until they are ready to hatch. Most decapods carry the eggs attached to the pleopods, while peracarids, notostracans, anostracans, and many isopods form a brood pouch from the carapace and <b>thoracic</b> limbs. Female Branchiura do not carry eggs in external ovisacs but attach them in rows to rocks and other objects. Most leptostracans and krill carry the eggs between their <b>thoracic</b> limbs; some copepods carry their eggs in special thin-walled sacs, while others have them attached together in long, tangled strings.|$|E
5|$|Kühn {{was born}} in Dresden, Germany on 14 February 1982. At the age of 20, after {{finishing}} high school, she took a holiday in the United States. While horseback riding in Monument Valley, she had a bad fall and became paralysed from the fifth <b>thoracic</b> vertebra down.|$|E
5|$|No {{significant}} difference appears in treatment success rates between linezolid, glycopeptides, or appropriate beta-lactam antibiotics {{in the treatment}} of pneumonia. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia developed by the American <b>Thoracic</b> Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend that linezolid be reserved for cases in which MRSA has been confirmed as the causative organism, or when MRSA infection is suspected based on the clinical presentation. The guidelines of the British <b>Thoracic</b> Society do not recommend it as first-line treatment, but rather as an alternative to vancomycin. Linezolid is also an acceptable second-line treatment for community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia when penicillin resistance is present.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} caterpillar, such as many hawkmoths (Sphingidae), have eyespots on their {{anterior}} abdominal segments. When alarmed, they retract {{the head and}} the <b>thoracic</b> segments into the body, leaving the apparently threatening large eyes {{at the front of}} the visible part of the body.|$|E
5|$|Sometime in the Carboniferous Period, some 350 {{million years}} ago, {{when there were}} only two major land masses, insects began flying. How and why insect wings developed, however, is not well understood, largely due to the {{scarcity}} of appropriate fossils from the period of their development in the Lower Carboniferous. Three main theories on the origins of insect flight are that wings developed from paranotal lobes, extensions of the <b>thoracic</b> terga; that they are modifications of movable abdominal gills as found on aquatic naiads of mayflies; or that they developed from <b>thoracic</b> protrusions used as radiators.|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} {{is one of}} {{the upper}} parts of the digestive system. There are taste buds on its upper part. It begins {{at the back of the}} mouth, passing downwards through the rear part of the mediastinum, through the diaphragm, and into the stomach. In humans, the esophagus generally starts around the level of the sixth cervical vertebra behind the cricoid cartilage of the trachea, enters the diaphragm at about the level of the tenth <b>thoracic</b> vertebra, and ends at the cardia of the stomach, at the level of the eleventh <b>thoracic</b> vertebra. The esophagus is usually about 25cm (10in) in length.|$|E
5|$|The root of {{the lower}} incisor is visible {{at the back of}} the {{mandible}} (lower jaw) as a slight protrusion; a true capsular process is absent. There are 13 <b>thoracic</b> (chest), 7 lumbar, 4 sacral, and 38 or 39 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The humerus (upper arm bone) lacks an entepicondylar foramen.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} {{consists of}} very lightweight bones. They have large air-filled cavities (called pneumatic cavities) which {{connect with the}} respiratory system. The skull bones in adults are fused and do not show cranial sutures. The orbits are large and separated by a bony septum. The spine has cervical, <b>thoracic,</b> lumbar and caudal regions {{with the number of}} cervical (neck) vertebrae highly variable and especially flexible, but movement is reduced in the anterior <b>thoracic</b> vertebrae and absent in the later vertebrae. The last few are fused with the pelvis to form the synsacrum. The ribs are flattened and the sternum is keeled for the attachment of flight muscles except in the flightless bird orders. The forelimbs are modified into wings.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thoracic</b> {{segments}} {{have one}} ganglion on each side, which are connected into a pair, one pair per segment. This arrangement is also {{seen in the}} abdomen {{but only in the}} first eight segments. Many species of insects have reduced numbers of ganglia due to fusion or reduction. Some cockroaches have just six ganglia in the abdomen, whereas the wasp Vespa crabro has only two in the thorax and three in the abdomen. Some insects, like the house fly Musca domestica, have all the body ganglia fused into a single large <b>thoracic</b> ganglion.|$|E
5|$|The trachea and bronchi {{form the}} tracheobronchial tree. The trachea is {{situated}} between {{the lower end}} of the larynx and the center of the chest, where it splits into the two bronchi at a ridge called the carina. The trachea is stabilized and kept open by rings made of cartilage that surround the front and sides of the structure; these rings are not closed and do not surround the back, which is made of membrane. The bronchi split into smaller branches and then to bronchioles that supply air to the alveoli, the tiny air-filled sacs in the lungs responsible for absorbing oxygen. An arbitrary division can be made between the intrathoracic and cervical trachea at the <b>thoracic</b> inlet, an opening at the top of the <b>thoracic</b> cavity. Anatomical structures that surround and protect the tracheobronchial tree include the lungs, the esophagus, large blood vessels, the rib cage, the <b>thoracic</b> spine, and the sternum. Children have softer tracheas and a more elastic tracheobronchial trees than adults; this elasticity, which helps protect the structures from injury when they are compressed, may contribute to the lower incidence of TBI in children.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} types of double-lumen endo-bronchial tubes that have endobronchial as well as endotracheal channels (Carlens, White and Robertshaw tubes). These tubes are typically coaxial, with two separate channels and two separate openings. They incorporate an endotracheal lumen which terminates in the trachea and an endobronchial lumen, the distal tip of which is positioned 1–2cm into the right or left mainstem bronchus. There is also the Univent tube, which has a single tracheal lumen and an integrated endobronchial blocker. These tubes enable one to ventilate both lungs, or either lung independently. Single-lung ventilation (allowing the lung on the operative side to collapse) can be useful during <b>thoracic</b> surgery, as it can facilitate the surgeon's view and access to other relevant structures within the <b>thoracic</b> cavity.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the head}} and thorax is the {{membranous}} neck or cervix. It comprises a pair of lateral cervical sclerites and is composed of both cephalic and <b>thoracic</b> elements. Between {{the head and}} the thorax is a tufted scale called the pronotum. On either side is a shield-like scale called a scapula. In the Noctuoidea, the metathorax is modified {{with a pair of}} tympanal organs.|$|E
5|$|Crickets {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with mostly cylindrical, somewhat vertically flattened bodies. The head is spherical with long slender antennae arising from cone-shaped scapes (first segments) and just behind {{these are two}} large compound eyes. On the forehead are three ocelli (simple eyes). The pronotum (first <b>thoracic</b> segment) is trapezoidal in shape, robust, and well-sclerotinized. It is smooth and has neither dorsal or lateral keels (ridges).|$|E
5|$|Females {{have four}} pairs of mammae, {{as usual in}} oryzomyines. Like most rice rats, Transandinomys species have twelve <b>thoracic</b> (chest) and seven lumbar vertebrae. According to a study in Costa Rica, T.bolivaris has 58chromosomes {{and the number of}} {{chromosomal}} arms (fundamental number) is 80 (2n=58, FN=80). Studies in Ecuador and Venezuela have recorded several different karyotypes in T.talamancae, with the number of chromosomes ranging from 34 to 54 and the fundamental number from 60 to 67.|$|E
5|$|For both NSCLC and SCLC, the {{two general}} types of staging {{evaluations}} are clinical staging and surgical staging. Clinical staging is performed prior to definitive surgery. It {{is based on}} the results of imaging studies (such as CT scans and PET scans) and biopsy results. Surgical staging is evaluated either during or after the operation and {{is based on the}} combined results of surgical and clinical findings, including surgical sampling of <b>thoracic</b> lymph nodes.|$|E
5|$|Hereditary {{recurrent}} pneumothorax or pulmonary cysts {{are associated}} with Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis. Non-hereditary recurrent pneumothorax and/or pulmonary cysts can occur with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These conditions are differentiated from Birt–Hogg–Dubé through examining the patient history and performing a physical examination. In women suspected to have the disease, ruling out pulmonary or <b>thoracic</b> endometriosis may be necessary.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their striking, superficial similarity to contemporary shrimp, Waptia fieldensis were also very shrimp-like in their habits. They were bottom-dwelling (nektobenthic) deposit feeders. The lack of strong feeding appendages indicates {{that they were more}} likely to feed by sifting through the sea bottom for edible organic particles. Their tails and the feather-like filaments on their posterior <b>thoracic</b> somites also imply that they were active swimmers.|$|E
5|$|Males {{must first}} wait to sense a female’s pheromones {{before they can}} locate her. Before males engage in flight to find a female, they warm-up by {{shivering}} the major flight muscles to reach <b>thoracic</b> temperature optimal to sustain flight, around 26 degrees Celsius. The thermoregulatory shivering activities of males were measured as they were exposed to different sex-related olfactory cues. Males are found to heat up more quickly {{in the presence of}} a female pheromone and take-off at a lower <b>thoracic</b> temperature than males who are exposed to other chemical scents. Since heating up to the right temperature leads to better flight performance than flying immediately, there is a trade-off between sub-optimal flight performance and rapid onset of directed flight. Helicoverpa zea males exposed to an attractive pheromone blend thus spend less time shivering and increase their heating rate. Thermoregulatory behavior of unrestrained moths is associated with competition for access to females, showing the ecological trade-off.|$|E
5|$|SCI {{is present}} in about 2% of all cases of blunt force trauma. Anyone who has {{undergone}} force sufficient to cause a <b>thoracic</b> spinal injury is {{at high risk for}} other injuries also. In 44% of SCI cases, other serious injuries are sustained at the same time; 14% of SCI patients also suffer head trauma or facial trauma. Other commonly associated injuries include chest trauma, abdominal trauma, pelvic fractures, and long bone fractures.|$|E
5|$|Some {{risk factors}} {{influence}} {{the location of}} DVT within the body. In isolated distal DVT, the profile of risk factors appears distinct from proximal DVT. Transient factors, such as surgery and immobilization, appear to dominate, whereas thrombophilias and age {{do not seem to}} increase risk. In upper-extremity DVT, the most important risk factor is having a central venous catheter, and <b>thoracic</b> outlet syndrome also increases risk.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is driven by}} the {{sympathetic}} nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating in the <b>thoracic</b> spinal cord, from vertebrae T5–T11. Because it is innervated by preganglionic nerve fibers, the adrenal medulla can be considered as a specialized sympathetic ganglion. Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.|$|E
5|$|The artery has a {{variable}} origin. It mostly {{arises from the}} brachiocephalic trunk, but may also originate from the aortic arch, the right common carotid, the subclavian, the pericardiacophrenic artery, the thyrocervical trunk, the transverse scapular or the internal <b>thoracic</b> artery. It ascends {{in front of the}} trachea in the superior mediastinum to {{the lower part of the}} thyroid gland.|$|E
5|$|The gene TGFBR2 {{has been}} implicated in several {{connective}} tissue disorders including Marfan syndrome, arterial tortuosity, and <b>thoracic</b> aortic aneurysm. A study of patients with SCSFLS demonstrated no mutations in this gene. Minor features of Marfan syndrome {{has been found in}} 20% of CSF leak patients. Abnormal findings of fibrillin-1 has been documented in these CSF-leak patients, but only one patient demonstrated a fibrillin-1 defect consistent with Marfan syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The mantis thorax {{consists}} of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer {{than the other two}} <b>thoracic</b> segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing {{for a wide range of}} movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thoracic</b> duct, which drains the {{majority}} of the body's lymph, passes behind the esophagus, curving from lying behind the esophagus on the right in {{the lower part of the}} esophagus, to lying behind the esophagus on the left in the upper esophagus. The esophagus also lies in front of parts of the hemiazygos veins and the intercostal veins on the right side. The vagus nerve divides and covers the esophagus in a plexus.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{esophagus}} lies at {{the back}} of the mediastinum behind the trachea, adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe, and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column. The lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the <b>thoracic</b> aorta. From the bifurcation of the trachea downwards, the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left atrium. At this point it passes through the diaphragm.|$|E
5|$|Zygoballus sexpunctatus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to Zygoballus rufipes, with whom its range overlaps. The male can be distinguished from Z.rufipes by the large spot of white scales {{at the beginning of}} the <b>thoracic</b> slope (which is lacking in Z. rufipes), and by the longitudinal division present on the bulb of the pedipalp (Z. rufipes has a transverse division). The female can best be distinguished by the form of the epigyne (the external genital structure).|$|E
25|$|The <b>thoracic</b> curve, concave forward, {{begins at}} {{the middle of the}} second and ends at the middle of the twelfth <b>thoracic</b> vertebra. Its most {{prominent}} point behind corresponds to the spinous process of the seventh <b>thoracic</b> vertebra. This curve is known as a kyphotic curve.|$|E
25|$|Endoscopic <b>thoracic</b> sympathectomy (ETS) is a {{surgical}} procedure {{in which a}} portion of the sympathetic nerve trunk in the <b>thoracic</b> region is destroyed.|$|E
25|$|When the {{temperature}} of the nest becomes too hot (over 29°C), the queen attempts to fan the nest to bring {{the temperature}} back down. In addition, workers have been observed to modulate body temperature. As protein content of food sources increase, <b>thoracic</b> temperature increases. Workers collecting high-quality protein had <b>thoracic</b> temperatures 1.98°C higher than workers collecting low-quality protein. A possible explanation is that they modulate <b>thoracic</b> temperatures to increase foraging efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Scoliosis is also {{classified}} {{according to}} the region(s) they affect. The vertebral column can be deformed at the <b>thoracic</b> level, at the lumbar level or at both. In the lumbar region, scoliosis induces perturbations to standing balance. The <b>thoracic</b> region is the location that most impacts movement strategies. Scoliosis impedes on {{the movement of the}} ribs, places the respiratory muscles at a mechanical disadvantage and displaces the various organs of the <b>thoracic</b> cavity.|$|E
