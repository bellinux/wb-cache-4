5|$|During 1982, <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>Army</b> {{initiated}} the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) {{program with the}} aim of producing a replacement for several existing rotorcraft, including the UH-1, AH-1, OH-6, and OH-58 helicopters. It was a further six years until, during 1988, a formal request for proposal (RFP) was issued to various manufacturers, in time which the requirement had evolved into a battlefield reconnaissance helicopter. During October 1988, it was revealed that two separate teams, these being Boeing–Sikorsky and Bell–McDonnell Douglas, received contracts to proceed with further development work upon their submitted concepts. During the 1990s, it was announced that the program's name had been changed from LHX to simply Light Helicopter (LH). During April 1991, <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>Army</b> decided to select the design proposal produced by the Boeing–Sikorsky team as the contest winner; shortly thereafter, the team received a contract for the construction of four prototypes, which were intended to be operated in an extended demonstration and evaluation phase.

5|$|During summer 1942, more {{soldiers}} arrived in Fairbanks to replace those {{moved away from}} town. Fairbanks residents were drafted to work at Ladd Field because <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>Army</b> believed Alaskans were best experienced in cold-weather work. After gold mining was suspended during the war, the Army leased FE Co. offices and requisitioned supplies from Fairbanks businesses. Wartime demand and the draft caused a severe labor shortage in Fairbanks, and supplies of various food and commercial products were interrupted beyond the wartime rationing {{in the rest of}} the country. Crime also increased, and because <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>Army</b> was placed in wartime control of the Alaska Territory, all newspapers and letters to and from Fairbanks were censored.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Clifton High School was {{relocated}} to the property, and in 1941 <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>Army</b> Medical Corps established a facility for wounded soldiers, {{known as the}} 74th General Hospital, in the estate grounds.

With many tents later replaced by prefabricated buildings and some nissen huts, {{at one point in}} the war following D-Day it became the largest US Army hospital in Europe.
