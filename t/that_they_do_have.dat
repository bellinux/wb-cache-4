25|$|Between 1878 and 1884, Muybridge perfected {{his method}} of horses in motion, proving <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> all four hooves {{off the ground}} during their running stride. In 1872, Muybridge settled Stanford's {{question}} with a single photographic negative showing his Standardbred trotting horse named Occident, airborne at the trot. This negative was lost, but the image survives through woodcuts made at the time (the technology for printed reproductions of photographs was still being developed). He later did additional studies, as well as improving his camera for quicker shutter speed and faster film emulsions. By 1878, spurred on by Stanford to expand the experiments, Muybridge had successfully photographed a horse at a trot; lantern slides have survived of this later work. Scientific American was among the publications {{at the time that}} carried reports of Muybridge's ground-breaking images.|$|E

He is led to {{consider}} the possibility that his mother had had an affair with the Smoking Man, a connection which may have resulted in the birth of either Samantha or Mulder himself. The possibility was hinted at later in the series, and Jeffrey Spender, who certainly was the Smoking Man's son, said that Mulder was his half-brother.

2500|$|A {{spokesperson}} for the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers, noted that Gosnell had been rejected for membership following inspection, because his clinics did not meet appropriate standards of care, but that [...] "they’d cleaned the place up and hired an RN [...] for our visit. We only saw first-trimester procedures." [...] She adding that [...] "Unfortunately, some women don't know where to turn. You sometimes have substandard providers preying on low-income women who don't know <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> other (safe) options." [...] A {{spokesperson for}} Planned Parenthood in Southeastern Pennsylvania, condemned Gosnell, saying, [...] "We would condemn any physician who does not follow the law or endangers anyone’s health... All women {{should have access to}} high-quality care when they are vulnerable and facing difficult decisions." [...] Dayle Steinberg, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania, says she knew that Gosnell had provided abortions in Philadelphia for many years, but says she hadn't heard of any problems at his clinic until the allegations surfaced. She has been quoted as stating that [...] "when Gosnell was in practice, women would sometimes come to Planned Parenthood for services after first visiting Gosnell's West Philadelphia clinic, and would complain to staff about the conditions there. We would always encourage them to report it to the Department of Health." [...] She clarified that [...] "when Gosnell was arrested, I asked our staff if anyone had ever heard of him, and clinic staff members reported that a few women over the years said they were concerned about the uncleanliness of his facility and came to Planned Parenthood instead... if we had heard anything remotely like the conditions that have since come to light about Gosnell's facility, of course we would have alerted the state and other authorities".|$|E

Even if one could get away for a day there is no temptation to ride about that desert-looking country, with the sun burning down on one; no one but a {{salamander}} could stand it. They are about the roughest-looking lot I ever saw in the town. Everyone has got something to do with hides one way or the other. They have either come in with them from the country, or they pack them in the warehouses, or they ship them. That and mining seem the only two things going on, and the miners, with their red shirts and pistols and knives, look even a rougher lot than the others. I took my pistol when last I went ashore; I will lend it you this evening." ...|$|E
60|$|Let us {{attend to}} that {{argument}} {{for a little}} while and see if it be sound. You do not raise sugar-cane (except the new-fashioned sugar-cane, and you won't raise that long), but they do raise it in Louisiana. You don't raise it in Ohio, because you can't raise it profitably, because the climate don't suit it. They do raise it in Louisiana, because there it is profitable. Now, Douglas will tell you that is precisely the slavery question: <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> slaves there because they are profitable, and you don't have them here because they are not profitable. If that is so, then it leads to dealing with the one precisely as with the other. Is there, then, anything in the constitution or laws of Ohio against raising sugar-cane? Have you found it necessary to put any such provision in your law? Surely not! No man desires to raise sugar-cane in Ohio, but if any man did desire to do so, you would say it was a tyrannical law that forbids his doing so; and whenever you shall agree with Douglas, whenever your minds are brought to adopt his argument, as surely you will have reached the conclusion that although it is not profitable in Ohio, if any man wants it, is wrong to him not to let him have it.|$|E
