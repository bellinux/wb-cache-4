5|$|Following {{the failure}} of various {{attempts}} on Alexander's life, Elagabalus stripped his cousin of his titles, revoked his consulship, and invented the rumor that Alexander was near death, in order <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> Praetorians would react. A riot ensued, and the Guard demanded to see Elagabalus and Alexander in the Praetorian camp.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{arterial}} ultrasound study, {{when the}} sonographer studies venous insufficiency, the vein wall itself has no relevance and attention will {{be focused on}} the direction of blood flow. The objective of the examination is <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> veins drain. In this way, venous ultrasonography has at times become a hemodynamic examination which is reserved for experienced sonographers who have completed hemodynamic studies and training and have acquired a deep knowledge of this subject.|$|E
5|$|Butlin {{proposed}} a new holiday camp at Clacton-on-Sea in Essex in 1936. Both {{the council and}} the local association of hotels were against the idea, as were the boarding house keepers. To persuade them, Butlin took {{the members of the}} council to Skegness <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> people there appreciated their holiday camp. The councillors were soon won over when they learnt that the local traders in Skegness had seen an initial dip in custom after its construction followed by a rise as campers had visited the town and seasonal workers had come to spend their pay. Once approved by the council, construction began and the camp opened in 1938.|$|E

5|$|The Nordstrand area of Aker {{was first}} served by steam ships from the 1860s, which {{connected}} the lower areas to Oslo. In 1879, the Østfold Line (then the Smaalen Line) opened in 1879, giving these areas a regular service {{unaffected by the}} weather. In 1897, a public meeting was held regarding transport in the upper parts of Nordstand, the Ekeberg area. On 15 March 1899, Solicitor Einar Borgen, Engineer A. J. Jackwitz and Robert Iversen sent an application to build an electric railway from Oslo to Ljan. They were later supplemented with Contractor S. Sørensen. The application was considered in Aker Municipal Council on 14 March 1901, and placed on hold. It was again considered a year later, {{this time it was}} placed on hold because the politicians wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> new Railway Act would affect the plans.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} September 11 added {{new meaning to}} In Search of America, the project Jennings and Brewster started after {{the success of their}} {{previous}} collaboration. The two began writing the book in early 2001; after the terrorist attacks, they revisited many of the people they had interviewed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> events had affected them. To promote the book, the anchor and World News Tonight started a 50-state tour of the United States in April 2002 as part of a yearlong project, 50 States/One Nation/One Year. Jennings also anchored a six-part television series in September 2002, which featured the same name as the book. Despite the success of the TV series and heavy promotion by the book's publisher, In Search of America failed to generate much interest or sales.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. Mercedes conducted race simulations <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> cars would behave with a heavy fuel load. Rosberg was fastest in the first practice session with a lap time of one minute and 35.461 seconds, ahead of teammate Hamilton in second. Alonso was third-fastest, ahead of Bottas and Kimi Räikkönen. Magnussen, Ricciardo, Button and Daniil Kvyat rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Verstappen's run ended early when he pulled {{over to the side}} of the track at the S curves with smoke billowing from his engine because of a broken exhaust valve, and Merhi spun at turn 13 (causing Bottas to swerve to avoid him).|$|E

25|$|A cricket ball is not {{a perfect}} sphere. The seam of the ball is the {{circular}} stitching which joins {{the two halves of}} the cricket ball. Hence, the seam joining the pieces of leather is circumferential and the stitching is noticeably raised.

It may move in any direction, or just go straight. The batsman has <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> ball moves after pitching to select his shot.|$|E
