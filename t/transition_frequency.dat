5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century much {{progress}} was made in increasing the accuracy of measurements of the speed of light, first by cavity resonance techniques and later by laser interferometer techniques. These were aided by new, more precise, definitions of the metre and second. In 1950, Louis Essen determined the speed as , using cavity resonance. This value was adopted by the 12th General Assembly of the Radio-Scientific Union in 1957. In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of a particular spectral line of krypton-86, and, in 1967, the second was redefined in terms of the hyperfine <b>transition</b> <b>frequency</b> of the ground state of caesium-133.|$|E

The overall accuracy of single-trapped-ion-based optical standards closely approaches that of the state-of-the-art caesium fountain standards.

So far, interrogation of neutral-atom-based optical standards {{has been carried out}} primarily in free space, unavoidably including atomic motional effects that typically limit the overall system accuracy.

2500|$|Following {{several years}} of work, Louis Essen from the National Physical Laboratory (Teddington, England) and William Markowitz from the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) {{determined}} {{the relationship between the}} hyperfine <b>transition</b> <b>frequency</b> of the caesium atom and the ephemeris second. [...] Using a common-view measurement method based on the received signals from radio station WWV, they determined the orbital motion of the Moon about the Earth, from which the apparent motion of the Sun could be inferred, in terms of time as measured by an atomic clock. [...] They found that the second of ephemeris time (ET) had the duration of 9,192,631,770 ± 20 cycles of the chosen caesium frequency.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} results {{regarding the}} "transition frequencies" of two acoustically interacting bubbles have been verified numerically. The theory provided by Ida [Phys. Lett. A 297 (2002) 210] predicted {{the existence of}} three <b>transition</b> <b>frequencies</b> per bubble, {{each of which has}} the phase difference of π / 2 between a bubble's pulsation and the external sound field, while previous theories predicted only two natural frequencies which cause such phase shifts. Namely, two of the three <b>transition</b> <b>frequencies</b> correspond to the natural frequencies, while the remaining does not. In a subsequent paper [M. Ida, Phys. Rev. E 67 (2003) 056617], it was shown theoretically that <b>transition</b> <b>frequencies</b> other than the natural frequencies may cause the sign reversal of the secondary Bjerknes force acting between pulsating bubbles. In the present study, we employ a direct numerical simulation technique that uses the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a surface-tension term as the governing equations to investigate the <b>transition</b> <b>frequencies</b> of two coupled bubbles by observing their pulsation amplitudes and directions of translational motion, both of which change as the driving frequency changes. The numerical results reproduce the recent theoretical predictions, validating the existence of the <b>transition</b> <b>frequencies</b> not corresponding to the natural frequency.

50|$|The {{transition}} between two hyperfine {{states of the}} atom can be triggered by two laser beams: the first beam excites the atom to a virtual excited state (for example because its frequency {{is lower than the}} real <b>transition</b> <b>frequency),</b> and the second beam deexcites the atom to the other hyperfine level.

50|$|The primary {{motivation}} {{behind the}} development of the atomic fountain derives from the Ramsey method of measuring the frequency of atomic transitions. In broad strokes, the Ramsey method involves exposing a cloud of atoms to a brief radiofrequency (rf) electromagnetic field; waiting a time T; briefly exposing the cloud to the rf field again; and then measuring what fraction of the atoms in the cloud have transitioned. If the frequency of the rf field is identical to the atomic <b>transition</b> <b>frequency,</b> 100% of the atoms will have transitioned; if the frequency of the field differs slightly from the <b>transition</b> <b>frequency,</b> some of the atoms will not have transitioned. By repeatedly sending clouds of atoms through such an apparatus, the frequency of the field can be adjusted to match the atomic <b>transition</b> <b>frequency.</b>|$|E

Expression of P fimbriae is regulated by phase variation, and to date, phase <b>transition</b> <b>frequencies</b> have been measured only for pap regulatory region constructs integrated into the E. coli K- 12 chromosome. The aim of this work was to measure P phase <b>transition</b> <b>frequencies</b> in clinical isolates for the first time, including frequencies for the sequenced strain E. coli CFT 073. P fimbriation and associated phase <b>transition</b> <b>frequencies</b> were measured for two E. coli clinical isolates and compared with levels for homologous pap constructs in E. coli K- 12.
