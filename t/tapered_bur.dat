40|$|A {{high-speed}} {{hand piece}} with copious water coolant {{was used to}} resect the crowns at the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ). Following this, each root surface was thoroughly planed and flattened with a fine diamond <b>tapered</b> <b>bur</b> to expose the underlying dentin. Each root was then sectioned longitudinally into 6 equal parts and, using a NÂ° 3 round bur in a high speed hand piece with copious water coolant, a horizontal shallow groo-ve was made in an apico-coronal direction on the pul-pal surface of every root for identification purposes. The dentin specimens measured about 3 x 4 x 2 mm. This yielded a total of 72 dentin specimens, 12 speci-men aving been discarded for non-conformity. III- TREATMENT The solutions used for treatment of the root dentin specimens were sodium chloride- 0. 9 % (saline pH 5. 1) and citric acid (pH 1. 1). The pH of each solution was tested with a hand held, battery operated pH meter Model 5941. 00. 1 The specimens {{were divided into two}} equal groups of 36 specimens each. Group A: Thirty-six dentin blocks were randomly divided into 6 sub-groups, with each tooth contributing one block to each sub-group. The following conditions applied to each of the sub-groups: sub-groups I, II, III, IV and V were soaked in sodium chloride for 5 s, 10 s, 30 s, 1 min. and 2 min res-pectively. The specimens in sub-group VI were soaked in citric acid for 3 min and served as controls. Group B: The remaining 36 blocks were assigned to sub-groups in exactly the same manner as for Group A, except that the specimens were subjected to burnishing with saline and citric acid (control) for the equivalent periods as for Group A.

40|$|Aim To {{evaluate}} the bond strength of AH Plus and Epiphany sealers to human root canal dentine irradiated with a 980 nm diode laser at different power and frequency parameters, using the push-out test. Methodology Sixty canine roots were sectioned below the cementoenamel junction to provide 4 -mm-thick dentine discs that had their root canals prepared with a <b>tapered</b> <b>bur</b> and irrigated with sodium hypochlorite, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and distilled water. The specimens {{were assigned to}} five groups (n = 12) : one control (no laser) and four experimental groups that were submitted to 980 nm diode laser irradiation at different power (1. 5 and 3. 0 W) and frequency (continuous wave and 100 Hz) parameters. Half of specimens in each group had their canals filled with AH Plus sealer and half with Epiphany. The push-out test was performed and data (MPa) were analysed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey`s test (P < 0. 05). The specimens were split longitudinally and examined under SEM to assess the failure modes after sealer displacement. Results The specimens irradiated with the diode laser and filled with AH Plus had significantly higher bond strength values (8. 69 +/- 2. 44) than those irradiated and filled with Epiphany (3. 28 +/- 1. 58) and the nonirradiated controls (3. 86 +/- 0. 60). The specimens filled with Epiphany {{did not differ significantly}} to each other or to the control (1. 75 +/- 0. 69). There was a predominance of adhesive failures at Epiphany-dentine interface (77 %) and mixed failures at AH Plus-dentine interface (67 %). Conclusions The 980 nm diode laser irradiation of root canal dentine increased the bond strength of AH Plus sealer, but did not affect the adhesion of Epiphany sealer...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Use {{of glass}} ionomer cement as pit and fissure sealant, has added benefit by its fluoride-releasing property. The {{efficacy}} of using invasive and non-invasive techniques {{was assessed by}} microleakage of Glass ionomer (Triage, G C Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and Resin based sealants (Concise, 3 M Dental Products, USA). Methods and Materials: In this in vitro experimental study, 80 sound premolars were divided into four groups of 20. In groups 1 and 2, Triage and in groups 3 and 4, Concise was used. In groups 1 and 3, fissures leaved intact (Noninvasive technique). In groups 2 and 4, fissures were prepared with <b>tapered</b> diamond <b>bur</b> (Invasive technique). The teeth were thermocycled at 5 o- 55 oc for 250 cycles and immersed in 5 % methylene blue solution for 24 hours. Sectioned samples were observed for the extent of dye penetration, and scores were based on established scoring criteria. 0 - Without dye penetration. 1 - Dye penetration restricted to the outer half of the sealant. 2 - Dye penetration restricted to the inner half of the sealant. 3 - Dye penetration into the underlying fissure. The {{data were analyzed using}} Kruskall-Wallis and Man-Whitney tests. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between invasive and noninvasive techniques; but microleakage of Triage was statistically more than Concise. Conclusion: Because {{there was no difference between}} the two techniques, invasive technique is not recommended. Considering the recent controversies, it can be said that Triage cannot be a viable alternative for resin based sealants.

40|$|The Epiphany (TM) Sealer {{is a new}} dual-curing {{resin-based}} sealer and {{has been}} introduced {{as an alternative to}} gutta-percha and traditional root canal sealers. The canal filling is claimed to create a seal with the dentinal tubules within the root canal system producing a `monoblock` effect between the sealer and dentinal tubules. Therefore, considering the possibility to incorporate the others adhesive systems, it is important to study the bond strength of the resulting cement. Forty-eight root mandibular canines were sectioned 8 -mm below CEJ. The dentine discs were prepared using a <b>tapered</b> diamond <b>bur</b> and irrigated with 1 % NaOCl and 17 % EDTA. Previous the application Epiphany (TM) Sealer, the Epiphany (TM) Primer, AdheSE, and One Up Bond F were applied to the root canal walls. The LED and QTH (Quartz Tungsten Halogen) were used to photo-activation during 45 s with power density of 400 and 720 mW/cm(2), respectively. The specimens were performed on a universal testing machine at a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min until bond failure occurred. The force was recorded and the debonding values were used to calculate Push-out bond strength. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey`s post-hoc tests showed significant statistical differences (P < 0. 05) to Epiphany (TM) Sealer/Epiphany (TM) Primer/QTH and EpiphanyTM Sealer/AdheSE/QTH, which had the highest mean values of bond strength.

40|$|Background: Resin-bonded {{bridgework}} {{with a metal}} {{framework is}} one of the most conservative ways to replace a tooth with intact abutments. Visibility of metal substructure and debonding are the complications of these bridgeworks. Today, with the introduction of fiber-reinforced composite resins, it is possible to overcome these complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bond strength of fiber-reinforced composite resin materials (FRC) to enamel. Methods: Seventy-two labial cross-sections were prepared from intact extracted teeth. Seventy-two rectangular samples of cured Vectris were prepared and their thickness was increased by adding Targis. The samples were divided into 3 groups for three different surface treatments: sandblasting, etching with 9 % hydrofluoric acid, and roughening with a round <b>tapered</b> diamond <b>bur.</b> Each group was then divided into two subgroups for bonding to etched enamel by Enforce and Variolink II resin cements. Instron universal testing machine was used to apply a tensile force. The fracture force was recorded and the mode of failure was identified under a reflective microscope. Results: There were no significant differences in bond strength between the three surface treatment groups (P= 0. 53). The mean bond strength of Variolink II cement was greater than that of Enforce (P= 0. 04). There was no relationship between the failure modes (cohesive and adhesive) and the two cement types. There was some association between surface treatment and failure mode. There were adhesive failures in sandblasted and diamond-roughened groups and the cohesive failure was dominant in the etched group. Conclusion: It is recommended that restorations made of fiber-reinforced composite resin be cemented with VariolinkII and surface-treated by hydrofluoric acid.
