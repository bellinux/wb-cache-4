5|$|The {{mouthpiece}} {{and reed}} {{are surrounded by}} the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past the reed and down the instrument. In <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits the mouthpiece. At this point the reed stays pressed against the mouthpiece until either the springiness of the reed forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into the reed and opens it. Each time the reed opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes {{at the point where}} the tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|E

25|$|The polywell {{attempts}} to confine the ions and electrons through two different means, borrowed from fusors and magnetic mirrors. The electrons {{are easier to}} confine magnetically because they have so much less mass than the ions. The machine confines ions using an electric field in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> fusor confines the ions: in the polywell, the ions are attracted to the negative electron cloud in the center. In the fusor, they are attracted to a negative wire cage in the center.|$|E

25|$|Rationalists {{also have}} {{different}} understanding and claims involving {{the connection between}} intuition and truth. Some rationalists claim that intuition is infallible and that anything we intuit to be true is as such. More contemporary rationalists accept that intuition {{is not always a}} source of certain knowledge– thus allowing for the possibility of a deceiver who might cause the rationalist to intuit a false proposition in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> third party could cause the rationalist to have perceptions of nonexistent objects.|$|E
25|$|A {{cordless}} telephone is a telephone with a wireless handset that communicates via radio waves with a base station {{connected to a}} fixed telephone line, usually within a limited range of its base station. The base station is on the subscriber premises, and attaches to the telephone network <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> corded telephone does. In 1965, an American woman named Teri Pall invented the {{cordless telephone}}. Due to difficulties of marketing, Pall never patented her invention. George Sweigert of Euclid, Ohio had more success, thus receiving a patent for the cordless telephone in 1969.|$|E
25|$|The {{cleavage}} {{reaction is}} a phosphodiester isomerization reaction that is initiated by abstraction of the cleavage-site ribose 2’-hydroxyl proton from the 2’-oxygen, which then becomes the attacking nucleophile in an “in-line” or SN2(P)-like reaction, {{although it is}} not known whether this proton is removed prior to or during the chemical step of the hammerhead cleavage reaction. (The cleavage reaction is technically not bimolecular, but behaves in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> genuine SN2(P) reaction does; it undergoes inversion of configuration subsequent to forming an associative transition-state consisting of a pentacoordinated oxyphosphrane.) The attacking and leaving group oxygens will both occupy the two axial positions in the trigonal bipyramidal transition-state structure as is required for an SN2-like reaction mechanism.|$|E

25|$|The Innate Knowledge {{thesis is}} similar to the Intuition/Deduction thesis in the regard that both theses claim {{knowledge}} is gained a priori. The two theses go their separate ways when describing how that knowledge is gained. As the name, and the rationale, suggests, the Innate Knowledge thesis claims knowledge is simply part of our rational nature. Experiences can trigger a process that allows this knowledge to come into our consciousness, but the experiences don't provide us with the knowledge itself. The knowledge has been with us since the beginning and the experience simply brought into focus, in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> photographer can bring the background of a picture into focus by changing the aperture of the lens. The background was always there, just not in focus.|$|E
25|$|Seismologists can use {{the arrival}} times of seismic waves in reverse to image the {{interior}} of the Earth. Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to propagate) and a dense solid inner core. These advances {{led to the development of}} a layered model of the Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more detailed view of {{the interior of the}} Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.|$|E
25|$|Bose {{sought and}} {{obtained}} agreement from the German High Command for the rather remarkable terms {{by which the}} Legion would serve in German military. German soldiers would train the Indians in the strictest military discipline, in all branches of infantry in using weapons and motorised units, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> German formation was trained; the Indian legionnaires {{were not to be}} mixed with any German formations; they were not to be sent to any front other than in India for fighting against the British—but would be allowed to fight in self-defence at any other place; and nonetheless in all other respects the legionnaires would enjoy the same facilities and amenities regarding pay, clothing, food, leave, etc., as German soldiers. As for the unit's eventual deployments in the Netherlands and France, they were ostensibly for training purposes, according to Bose's plans for the unit to be trained in some aspects of coastal defence. After the invasion of France by the Allies, the unit was ordered back to Germany, so that it would not participate in fighting for German military interests.|$|E

25|$|Many birds migrate in flocks. For larger birds, it {{is assumed}} that flying in flocks reduces energy costs. The V {{formation}} is often supposed to boost the efficiency and range of flying birds, particularly over long migratory routes. All the birds except the first fly in the upwash from one of the wingtip vortices of the bird ahead. The upwash assists each bird in supporting its own weight in flight, in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> glider can climb or maintain height indefinitely in rising air. Geese flying in a V formation save energy by flying in the updraft of the wingtip vortex generated by the previous animal in the formation. Thus, the birds flying behind do not need to work as hard to achieve lift. Studies show that birds in a V formation place themselves roughly at the optimum distance predicted by simple aerodynamic theory. Geese in a V-formation may conserve 12–20% of the energy they would need to fly alone. Red knots and dunlins were found in radar studies to fly 5km per hour faster in flocks than when they were flying alone. The birds flying at the tips and at the front are rotated in a timely cyclical fashion to spread flight fatigue equally among the flock members. The formation also makes communication easier and allows the birds to maintain visual contact with each other.|$|E
500|$|American {{paddlefish}} {{are among}} the largest and longest-lived freshwater fishes in North America. [...] They have a shark-like body, average [...] in length, weigh , and can live in excess of thirty years. [...] For most populations the median age is five to eight years and the maximum age is fourteen to eighteen years. The age of American paddlefish is best determined by dentary studies, a process which usually occurs on fish harvested during snagging season, a popular sport fishing activity {{in certain parts of}} the U.S. [...] The dentary is removed from the lower jawbone, cleaned of any remaining soft tissue, and cross-sectioned to expose the annual rings. [...] The dentary rings are counted in much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> tree is aged. [...] Dentary studies suggest that some individuals can live 60 years or longer, and that females typically live longer and grow larger than males.|$|E
