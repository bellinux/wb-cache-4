5|$|After having {{positioned}} {{to perform a}} scan inspection, the pantograph elevates the 3D scanner at <b>the</b> <b>fuselage.</b> A pan-tilt unit moves the scan device to acquire the hull. By comparing the data acquired to the three-dimensional model of the aircraft, algorithms are able to diagnose any faults in <b>the</b> <b>fuselage</b> structure and provide information on their shape, size and depth.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the forward}} and rear {{bulkhead}} was the bomb bay, which was constructed with a double-frame to strengthen it for carrying the bomb load. The {{space between the}} bomb bay and rear bulkhead was used up by Funkgerät radio equipment and contained the dorsal and flexible casemate ventral gunner positions. The rear bulkhead contained a hatch which allowed access {{into the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>fuselage</b> which was held together by a series of stringers. The wing was a two spar design. <b>The</b> <b>fuselage</b> was formed of stringers to which <b>the</b> <b>fuselage</b> skin was riveted. Internally the frames were fixed only to the stringers, which made for simpler construction at the cost of some rigidity.|$|E

5|$|Early F-16s {{could be}} armed {{with up to}} six AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking {{short-range}} air-to-air missiles (AAM) by employing rail launchers on each wingtip, as well as radar guided AIM-7 Sparrow medium-range AAMs in a weapons mix. More recent versions support the AIM-120 AMRAAM. The aircraft can carry various other AAMs, {{a wide variety of}} air-to-ground missiles, rockets or bombs; electronic countermeasures (ECM), navigation, targeting or weapons pods; and fuel tanks on 9 hardpoints – six under the wings, two on wingtips, and one under <b>the</b> <b>fuselage.</b> Two other locations under <b>the</b> <b>fuselage</b> are available for sensor or radar pods. The F-16 carries a 20 mm (0.787 in) M61A1 Vulcan cannon for close range aerial combat and strafing. The 20mm cannon is mounted inside <b>the</b> <b>fuselage</b> {{to the left of the}} cockpit.|$|E

5|$|He 111 H-2: This {{version was}} fitted with {{improved}} armament. Two D Stands (waist guns) in <b>the</b> <b>fuselage</b> giving the variant some five MG 15 Machine guns.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, {{before the}} flight {{testing of the}} prototypes was completed, 30 {{production}} aircraft were ordered. They incorporated an ejection seat and a redesigned vertical stabilizer {{as well as two}} auxiliary fins, one towards the tip {{on each side of the}} tailplane in an attempt to improve the directional stability of the aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>fuselage</b> was lengthened to fit additional equipment and the wing had fillets added at the rear junction with <b>the</b> <b>fuselage.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Board also {{recommended}} frequent inspections of wing root fittings {{for the development}} of fatigue cracks, increasing the thickness of the portion of the wing attached to <b>the</b> <b>fuselage,</b> and reduction of operating speeds by 10%.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> entire <b>fuselage</b> aft of <b>the</b> wing, {{along with}} the {{complete}} tail, was removable as a single unit {{for access to the}} engine. Once <b>the</b> aft <b>fuselage</b> was removed, it was easy to replace or adjust the engine. <b>The</b> aft <b>fuselage</b> ended with a circular adjustable exhaust nozzle.|$|R
50|$|The wing {{mounting}} was unusual, with airfoil section, N-form struts on {{each side}} connecting the wing spars not to <b>the</b> lower <b>fuselage</b> but instead to the frames that carried the independently rubber sprung undercarriage mainwheels. These frames, enclosed in streamlined fairings 2.50 m apart, were also braced <b>the</b> upper <b>fuselage</b> longerons with shorter N-struts and with inverted V-struts to <b>the</b> central <b>fuselage</b> underside. Short, inverted V-struts attached the wing centre section to <b>the</b> upper <b>fuselage.</b> There were no wing bracing wires.|$|R
50|$|Their empennages were conventional, with plywood covered {{horizontal}} tails {{on top of}} <b>the</b> <b>fuselages.</b> <b>The</b> fins {{were small}} and semi-circular and the fabric covered rudders had scalloped, rounded edges. They had fixed, tailskid undercarriages with mainwheels on a single axle rubber-sprung from a transverse member mounted on V-struts. The forward member of the V joined <b>the</b> forward <b>fuselage</b> just behind <b>the</b> metal cowling and the rear one went to the lower wing forward attachment points.|$|R
5|$|The skins of <b>the</b> <b>fuselage,</b> {{wings and}} {{tailplane}} were secured by rivets, and in critical {{areas such as}} the wing forward of the main spar where an uninterrupted airflow was required, with flush rivets; <b>the</b> <b>fuselage</b> used standard dome-headed riveting. From February 1943 flush riveting was used on <b>the</b> <b>fuselage,</b> affecting all Spitfire variants. In some areas, such as {{at the rear of the}} wing, and the lower tailplane skins, the top was riveted and the bottom fixed by brass screws which tapped into strips of spruce bolted to the lower ribs. The removable wing tips were made up of duralumin-skinned spruce formers. At first the ailerons, elevators and rudder were fabric-covered. When combat experience showed that fabric-covered ailerons were impossible to use at high speeds, a light alloy replaced the fabric, enhancing control throughout the speed range.|$|E
5|$|Tupolev TB-3 {{and three}} I-5, the third {{aircraft}} was attached over <b>the</b> <b>fuselage.</b> First flight August 1934. The TB-3 was piloted by Zalevskiy, the I-5s were piloted by Altynov, Suprun, and Suzi.|$|E
5|$|A {{combination}} of 14 longitudinal stringers and four main longerons {{attached to the}} frames helped form a light but rigid structure to which sheets of alclad stressed skinning were attached. <b>The</b> <b>fuselage</b> plating was 24, 20 and 18 gauge in order of thickness towards the tail, while the fin structure was completed using short longerons from frames 20 to 23, before being covered in 22 gauge plating.|$|E
40|$|An {{aircraft}} configuration {{consisting of a}} pair of fuselages parallel to each other and connected by a main wing and a horizontal stabilizer which pivot on <b>the</b> <b>fuselages</b> is described. <b>The</b> pivotal attachment allows the wing to be yawed relative to <b>the</b> <b>fuselages</b> for high speed flight {{while at the same time}} spreading the weight and volume distribution of the aircraft along the direction of flight. The main wing is curved upward at the tips to compensate for any roll tendencies caused by its yawed position...|$|R
40|$|There is {{described}} a vehicle door assembly with shear layer control for controlling the airflow {{in and around}} an aperture in <b>the</b> vehicle <b>fuselage.</b> <b>The</b> vehicle door assembly consists of an upper door and a lower door, both slidably mounted to the exterior surface of <b>the</b> vehicle <b>fuselage.</b> In addition, an inner door is slidably mounted beneath the upper door. Beneath the inner door is an aperture assembly having an aperture opening positionable to be substantially flush with the exterior surface of <b>the</b> vehicle <b>fuselage.</b> Also provided are means for positioning the aperture assembly in an upward and downward direction in relation to <b>the</b> vehicle <b>fuselage...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{layout of}} the He 111Z had the pilot and his {{controls}} in <b>the</b> port <b>fuselage</b> only. <b>The</b> controls themselves and essential equipment were all that remained in the starboard section. The aircraft had a crew of seven; a pilot, first mechanic, radio operator and gunner in <b>the</b> port <b>fuselage,</b> and <b>the</b> observer, second mechanic and gunner in <b>the</b> starboard <b>fuselage.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2005, Kenya Airways {{changed its}} livery. The four stripes running {{all through the}} length of <b>the</b> <b>fuselage</b> were {{replaced}} by the company slogan Pride of Africa, whereas the KA tail logo {{was replaced by a}} styled K encircled with a Q to evoke the airline's IATA airline code.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{a system}} of {{multiple}} receiver antennas was adopted, each one located so that only a certain section of the sky was visible. Two horizontal receivers were mounted {{on either side of}} <b>the</b> <b>fuselage</b> and only saw reflections from the left or right, slightly overlapping in the middle. Two vertical receivers were mounted above and below the wing, seeing reflections above or below the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Mk. III {{went into}} {{extensive}} testing at No. 25 Sqn in May 1940 and another troubling problem was found. As the target aircraft {{moved to the}} sides of the fighter, the error in the horizontal angle grew. Eventually, at about 60 degrees to the side, the target was indicated as being {{on the other side of}} the fighter. Hanbury Brown concluded that the problem was due to reflections between <b>the</b> <b>fuselage</b> and engine nacelles, due to the change to the long-nose IVF from the short-nose IF and IIF. In previous examples they had used <b>the</b> <b>fuselage</b> of the aircraft as the reflector, positioning and angling the antennas to run along the nose or wing leading edges.|$|E
50|$|After being towed to altitude, {{the crew}} {{would make a}} series of dives at {{different}} speeds. However, {{to be able to}} perform tests at higher speeds, the aircraft was also fitted with two Walter HWK-R II/203 rocket engines, delivering 750 kg of thrust each. They were installed in <b>the</b> <b>fuselages</b> with rocket nozzles under <b>the</b> lower <b>fuselage,</b> aligned 10 degrees down.|$|R

5|$|On 14 July 1996, a NATO E-3A, LX-N90457, overran {{the runway}} and dipped {{into the sea}} on takeoff from Preveza AB, Preveza, Greece. <b>The</b> <b>fuselage</b> broke into two, {{destroying}} the aircraft, {{but there were no}} casualties among the 16 crew members on board. It allegedly suffered a birdstrike during take off, but no evidence of a birdstrike was found.|$|E
5|$|On 15 July 2014, a Libyan Airlines A330 was {{severely}} damaged {{in the fighting}} in Libya and sustained bullet holes in <b>the</b> <b>fuselage.</b> On 20 July 2014, two Afriqiyah Airways Airbus A330 were hit by an RPG at Tripoli International Airport. One was completely destroyed in the ensuing fire.|$|E
5|$|TB-3 and {{a single}} I-Z under <b>the</b> <b>fuselage</b> which {{attached}} and detached {{in the air as}} there was not enough ground clearance for the fighter. On 23 March 1935, TB-3 piloted by Stefanovskiy and I-Z with Stepanchenok at the controls performed the world's first mid-air docking between two fixed wing aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The Cross was {{displayed}} on the flags of Free French warships, and <b>the</b> <b>fuselages</b> of Free French aircraft. The medal of the Order of Liberation bears the Cross of Lorraine.|$|R
50|$|Two prototypes {{were created}} by {{attaching}} an extra pair of inner-wing segments onto the wings of basic Ju 90 and Ju 290 airframes, and adding new sections to lengthen <b>the</b> <b>fuselages.</b>|$|R
50|$|The La-200 was an all-metal, two seater, twin-engined jet aircraft, with a {{tricycle}} undercarriage and mid set wings with 40° sweep at 1/4 chord.
