40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{articulate}} a consumer perception framework of environmental factors, considering a range of factors that affect businesses. By aiming to determine the antecedents of what consumers perceive as more environmentally preferable within corporations, it attempts to establish how green companies should communicate environmental considerations. The data was analysed using both descriptive measures and partial least squares to identify and validate the items contributing to each component in the model. All measures taken by the companies seem to be seen in the positive light towards perception of green companies by the participants. It was found that consumers believe that the government should contribute more towards environmental safety and provide more assistance for safeguarding the environment, whilst economic growth should be encouraged taking precaution not <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> companies should reduce pollution rather than think of increasing profits. Consistent with prior research,, consumers perceive that well known brand as always as safe products to buy, and that these contribute positively to overall to the perception of green companies. They will not purchase green brands if lower in quality and higher in price. Field of Research: Marketin...|$|E

It is desired {{to stop a}} kick because of its potential <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> and also to prevent the accident {{that can lead to}} loss of people and asset. The main focus in this project, however, has been on role of BOPs in avoiding environmental releases. Following the Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico, the world’s attention has fallen on the blowout preventers. This is mainly because of the vital role of BOP in accident prevention and mitigation. There are not a lot of studies on subsea BOP reliability, however the most applicable studies are performed by Rausand (1983), Holland (1999), and WEST (2009). This study focuses on BOP reliability in a qualitative approach. Standards and regulations in relation to BOP are reviewed and classified. Also, Failure modes and causes of individual component failures are identified and classified according to IEC standards using a failure modes, and effects analysis (FMEA). Finally, a fault tree analysis (FTA) is carried out to define the reliability of a BOP when a kick is present. In this report, it is tried to not only focus on the BOP itself, but consider it as a part of larger safety system. Recommendation for future standards based on literature review and results of this study are made. The current report is provided basis for a quantitative study of subsea BOP reliability. </p...|$|E

40|$|Environmentally {{conscious}} manufacturing {{has become}} a global attention for the iron and steel manufacturers to prevent global warming and climate change while making money. Iron and steel sector is considered {{as one of the}} most polluting sectors in the world. It is also one of the most energy intensive industries. During pig iron manufacturing, there is a number of steps that affect the environment emitting different pollutants. While some step(s) may be considered critical <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> among all the steps, some pollutant(s) may be considered critical to affect the environment among all the pollutants. This paper proposes environmental bottleneck to consider critical step and critical pollutant simultaneously. Unless environmental bottleneck is improved, environmental performance of the entire manufacturing process may not improve significantly even if other processes (i. e. other than environmental bottleneck) are taken care of. Thus, environmental bottleneck must be taken care of properly by the manufacturing organization to enable environmentally conscious manufacturing. Hence, a method should be developed to identify environmental bottleneck. Current research work uses Bayesian Networks (BN) to identify environmental bottleneck. The contribution of the paper is to identify the environmental bottleneck for an Indian pig iron manufacturing organization. Results suggest that carbon monoxide (CO) emission from the blast furnace is the environmental bottleneck for the current pig iron manufacturing organization. Hence, proper precautions should be considered to control the CO emission from the blast furnace...|$|E
