5|$|The {{publisher}} {{was encouraged}} by the book's critical and financial success and, therefore, requested a sequel. As Tolkien's work progressed on the successor The Lord of the Rings, he made retrospective accommodations for it in The Hobbit. <b>These</b> <b>few</b> but significant changes were integrated into the second edition. Further editions followed with minor emendations, including those reflecting Tolkien's changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo was, and is, renowned {{primarily}} as a painter. Among his works, the Mona Lisa is the most famous and most parodied portrait and The Last Supper the most reproduced religious painting of all time. Leonardo's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon, being reproduced on items {{as varied as the}} euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts. Perhaps fifteen of his paintings have survived. Nevertheless, <b>these</b> <b>few</b> works, together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting, compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary, Michelangelo.|$|E
5|$|The {{natural range}} of A.vera is unclear, as the species {{has been widely}} {{cultivated}} around the world. Naturalised strands of the species occur in the southern half of the Arabian Peninsula, through North Africa (Morocco, Mauritania, Egypt), as well as Sudan and neighbouring countries, along with the Canary, Cape Verde, and Madeira Islands. This distribution is somewhat {{similar to that of}} Euphorbia balsamifera, Pistacia atlantica, and a few others, suggesting that a dry sclerophyll forest once covered large areas, but has been dramatically reduced due to desertification in the Sahara, leaving <b>these</b> <b>few</b> patches isolated. For comparison, several closely related (or sometimes identical) species within other plant groups {{can be found on the}} two extreme sides of the Sahara: dragon trees (Dracaena) and Aeonium being two of the most representative examples.|$|E

5|$|Very {{few of the}} animators at the Disney studio had had artistic {{training}} (most {{had been}} newspaper cartoonists); among <b>these</b> <b>few</b> was Grim Natwick, who had trained in Europe. The animator's success in designing and animating Betty Boop for Fleischer Studios showed an understanding of human female anatomy, and when Walt Disney hired Natwick he was given female characters to animate almost exclusively. Attempts to animate Persephone, the female lead of The Goddess of Spring, had proved largely unsuccessful; Natwick's animation of the heroine in Cookie Carnival showed greater promise, and the animator was eventually given the task of animating Snow White herself. Though live action footage of Snow White, the Prince and the Queen was shot as reference for the animators, the artists' animators disapproved of rotoscoping, considering it to hinder the production of effective caricature. None of Babbit's animation of the Queen was rotoscoped; despite Graham and Natwick's objections, however, some scenes of Snow White and the Prince were directly traced from the live-action footage.|$|E
5|$|When {{recording}} was completed, Gridneff asked Boucher {{if he had}} {{any ideas}} for a further season of Star Cops. Boucher felt that were the series to continue he would like to extend the setting further out into the Solar System, visiting the Mars colonies and the Big Ring space colonies under construction. He intended to achieve this either by transferring one of the existing regular characters to the Mars colony or by introducing a new regular who would be based there. The second season was never developed beyond <b>these</b> <b>few</b> basic notions as it was clear to Boucher from an early stage that there was little prospect of the series being renewed. Following Star Cops, Boucher went on to work as script editor on the long-running ITV police drama The Bill before returning to freelance writing while Gridneff moved on to work on the BBC drama series The House of Eliott.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{due in part}} to <b>these</b> <b>few</b> brief {{periods of}} Algerian rule over Tunis in the early Ottoman era, later Turkish rulers in Algiers more than once tried to {{exercise}} control over Tunisian affairs by force, e.g., during intra-dynasty conflicts. Yet eventually such interference by Algiers was each time checked.|$|E
25|$|From 1919 {{until the}} Repeal of Prohibition in 1933, many Italian-Americans {{struggled}} to keep their vineyards going. Many remained through providing sacramental wine to the Catholic Church or grape juice to the general market. <b>These</b> <b>few</b> holdouts can be credited with salvaging America’s viticulture heritage, {{in an industry that}} values the longevity and tradition of the vine and its produce.|$|E

25|$|Set against <b>these</b> <b>few</b> {{documents}} is {{the abundant}} charter evidence that Richard never styled himself earl, nor {{did any of}} his children or grandchildren call him such, and neither did his wife after his death call herself Countess. Despite this, for many years the discrepancies caused disagreement over the numbering of the Devon earls. However, since the early 20th century the matter appears to be settled, {{and it is now}} accepted that the first Earl of Devon was Richard's son, Baldwin.|$|E
25|$|Transitivity is a thoroughgoing {{division}} of Basque verbs, {{and it is}} necessary to know the transitivity of a particular verb in order to conjugate it successfully. In the spoken language only a handful of commonly used verbs are fully conjugated in the present and simple past, most verbs being conjugated by means of an auxiliary which differs according to transitivity. The literary language includes a few more such verbs, but the number is still very small. Even <b>these</b> <b>few</b> verbs require an auxiliary to conjugate other tenses besides the present and simple past.|$|E
25|$|Despite her {{significant}} art patronage {{which included}} a number of portraits– no other person of her time was so often portrayed– {{there are very few}} surviving identified portraits of Isabella. <b>These</b> <b>few</b> identifications are known as inhomogeneous (i.e. differing eye and hair colours as well as divergent eyebrows in both Titian portraits) and there are no images of her between the ages of 26 and 54 (see picture). It is known that the elderly Isabella preferred idealized paintings and even waived sitting as a model. However it could be assumed that she still insisted on seeing her personal characteristics in the outcome.|$|E

50|$|In all, {{approximately}} five hundred race films were produced. Of <b>these,</b> <b>fewer</b> {{than one hundred}} remain. Because race films were produced outside the Hollywood studio system, they were largely forgotten by mainstream film historians until they resurfaced in the 1980s on the BET cable network. In their day, race films were very popular among African American theatergoers. Their influence continues to be felt in cinema and television marketed to African Americans.|$|R
25|$|The {{increasing}} number of British aircraft on the island, at last, prompted the Italians to employ German Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers to try to destroy the airfields. Finally, {{in an attempt to}} overcome the stiff resistance put up by <b>these</b> <b>few</b> aircraft, the Luftwaffe took up base on the Sicilian airfields, only to find that Malta was not an easy target. After numerous attacks on the island over the following months, and the arrival of an extra 23 Hurricanes at the end of April 1941, and a further delivery a month later, the Luftwaffe left Sicily for the Russian Front in June that year.|$|E
25|$|Another {{challenge}} of feminist historians is integration in digital format. Women’s historians {{have had some}} success in working with digital humanists in creating their databases, but the databases {{are few and far}} between. This creates a problem for feminist historians trying to create a feminist history database based on women’s history databases. Since data mining is not a field many digital humanist women are involved in, it can be a challenge to find the necessary relationships between <b>these</b> <b>few.</b> Though Filene argues that data mining {{is the best way to}} integrate histories, this lack of involvement by feminist digital humanists detaches the work from others sharing similar feminist historian’s work.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{comprehension}} {{and production of}} <b>these</b> <b>few</b> words demonstrated that she distinguished speech from other environmental sounds and could hear individual phonemes when listening to people talking, two critical early components of language acquisition. Nonetheless, based on their observations both Children's Hospital doctors and the linguists who later worked with her concluded {{that she had not}} acquired a first language during childhood. Due to the lack of physical or mental explanations for her lack of speech, Kent and Hansen attributed it to the extreme isolation of her childhood. Kent came away from his first encounters with Genie extremely pessimistic about her prognosis on all fronts.|$|E

25|$|On {{the deck}} of a typical trireme in the Peloponnesian War there were 4 or 5 archers and 10 or so marines. <b>These</b> <b>few</b> troops were {{peripherally}} effective in an offensive sense, but critical in providing defense for the oarsmen. Should the crew of another trireme board, the marines were all that stood between the enemy troops and the slaughter of the men below. It has also been recorded that if a battle were to take place in the calmer water of a harbor, oarsmen would join the offensive and throw stones (from a stockpile aboard) to aid the marines in harassing/attacking other ships.|$|E
25|$|Water sports practised in Ireland include canoeing, swimming, surfing, diving, water polo, sailing, and kayaking. Whilst {{many people}} {{participate}} in <b>these,</b> <b>few</b> do so competitively. Ireland has {{had only one}} Olympic medalist in swimming, Michelle Smith, and her medals have since been tarnished by drug allegations. The National Aquatic Centre was opened in Ireland in 2003 and held the European SC Championships in December 2003 – {{the first time the}} country hosted such a competition. At the competition, Ireland won its first medal at the European SC Championships ever, a silver in the 200m breaststroke by Andrew Bree. Swim Ireland is the national governing body of swimming in Ireland. See also List of Olympic-size swimming pools in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Several two-seat trainer {{variants}} of the Me 262, the Me 262 B-1a, had been adapted through the Umrüst-Bausatz 1 factory refit package as night fighters, complete with on-board FuG 218 Neptun high-VHF band radar, using Hirschgeweih ("stag's antlers") antennae {{with a set}} of dipole elements shorter than the Lichtenstein SN-2 had used, as the B-1a/U1 version. Serving with 10. Staffel Nachtjagdgeschwader 11, near Berlin, <b>these</b> <b>few</b> aircraft (alongside several single-seat examples) accounted for most of the 13 Mosquitoes lost over Berlin {{in the first three months}} of 1945. However, actual intercepts were generally or entirely made using Wilde Sau methods, rather than AI radar-controlled interception. As the two-seat trainer was largely unavailable, many pilots made their first jet flight in a single-seater without an instructor.|$|E

50|$|Fifty-one Sheridans were {{deployed}} in the Gulf War {{as some of the}} first tanks sent. They would not be very effective against the Russian-built T-72s.
