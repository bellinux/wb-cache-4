40|$|This essay narrates the {{development}} of cliometrics and neo-institutional history in the United States and its problems of acceptance among Latin American academics in general and in Colombia in particular. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>rivalry</b> <b>between</b> the two schools because they respond to somewhat different theoretical bases: whereas the former is based on neo- classical economic theory, the second questions its assumptions about the absence of frictions and institutions. Modern economic history had to compete with dependency theory in Latin America and only found some acceptance when the latter began to show problems of inconsistency, lack of rigour, absence of falseability tests, and inability to predict. Cliometrics was rejected from the start in Colombia, together with William P.

40|$|We {{argue that}} {{economics}} - as {{the scientific method}} of analyzing trade-offs - can be helpful (and may even be indispensable) for assessing the trade-off between intergenerational and intragenerational justice. Economic analysis can delineate the opportunity set of politics {{with respect to the}} two normative objectives of inter- and intragenerational justice, i. e. it can describe which outcomes are feasible in achieving the two objectives in a given context, and which are not. It can distinguish efficient from inefficient uses of instruments of justice. It can identify the opportunity cost of attaining one justice to a higher degree, in terms of less achievement of the other. We find that, under very general conditions, (1) efficiency in the use of instruments of justice implies that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>rivalry</b> <b>between</b> the two justices and the opportunity cost of either justice is positive; (2) negative opportunity costs of achieving one justice exist if there is facilitation between the two justices, which can only happen if instruments of justice are used inefficiently; (3) in outcomes of inefficient uses of instruments of justice in the interior of the opportunity set, the two justices are independent of each other and the opportunity cost of either justice is zero...|$|E
