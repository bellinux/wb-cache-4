5|$|At first, {{the film}} was on a tight budget; Giddens used his entire savings and mortgaged his house to raise money, saying <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> to impress ex-girlfriend, who {{provided}} the inspiration for this film's female protagonist, Shen Chia-yi.

Although {{he was a}} citizen of Czechoslovakia, Schindler became a spy for the Abwehr, an {{intelligence}} service of Nazi Germany, in 1936. He was assigned to Abwehrstelle II Commando VIII, based in Breslau. He later told Czech police <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> because he needed the money; by this time Schindler had a drinking problem and was chronically in debt.|$|E
5|$|In flashbacks, it is {{revealed}} that as children Tifa and Cloud {{had decided to}} follow a path to a mountain near their hometown of Nibelheim. However, they were both injured and Tifa {{was in a coma}} for a week, with her father holding Cloud responsible for the incident. Cloud eventually left to join Shinra's SOLDIER program in order to become stronger, but it is later revealed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> primarily to attract her attention. In response, she requested if she was ever in danger, he would return to save her. Years later, after Sephiroth destroyed the town of Nibelheim, Cloud rescued Tifa after she was wounded by Sephiroth. Surviving the incident, Tifa was taken to safety by her martial arts instructor Zangan, eventually arriving in Midgar and meeting AVALANCHE's leader, Barret Wallace. Upon recovering, she joined AVALANCHE so as to get revenge for the destruction of her home. She eventually encountered an incoherent Cloud at the city's train station, and convinced him to work for Barret, so as to keep him close and safe. This is {{the point at which the}} game begins.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, Scotus {{said that}} Mary was {{redeemed}} {{in anticipation of}} Christ's death on the cross. This {{was similar to the}} way that the Church explained the Last Supper, since Roman Catholic theology teaches that the Mass is the sacrifice of Calvary made present on the altar, and Christ did not die before the Last Supper. Scotus' defence of the immaculist thesis was summed up by one of his followers as potuit, decuit ergo fecit – God could do it, it was fitting <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> and so He did it.|$|E
25|$|Another scandal {{emerged from}} within the unit when a 38-year-old 1st Airborne Brigade paratrooper was arrested in Inzai, Chiba Prefecture for shoplifting. He {{admitted}} to officers <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> to demonstrate that he was serious {{in his effort to}} avoid deployment to Iraq. When JGSDF officials heard about this, they told press officials that they require the consent of the troopers and their relatives. Otherwise, they would not be deployed. The Iraq deployment had caused a national debate in Japan, and a new public consensus was necessary for the military to develop a modern role and structure.|$|E
25|$|On October 16, 1719, {{the royal}} vessel San Carlos docked in San Juan. The boat needed repairs and {{requested}} Enríquez's help, who {{determined that the}} damage had been caused due to excessive cargo. He responded by donating La Trinidad de Burdeos for free. This move disarmed Pozo's posture, but the functionary replaced them with new bold claims, even claiming that the frigate was damaged. All of the treasurer's complaints were dismissed and the ship left port. That same year a conglomerate of his enemies {{sent a letter to}} the king, completely composed by critics and false accusations. However, within a year Phillip V wrote a personal letter thanking Enríquez for his service. His fleet had become the de facto guardian of the Caribbean, surpassing the efficiency of the Armada de Barlovento. With growing contempt against him, Enríquez secured the well-being of his son by placing three houses in San Juan and a farm near Bayamón river (worth 20,000 pieces of eight) to the service of the church. This move guaranteed that they would be beyond the reach of his enemies, with the intention that Vicente would end serving as the chaplain of these properties, receiving a stable income and inheriting at least part of his fortune. To this end, he made a request to Valdivia so that Vicente could fulfill this role. Despite this office, he would also aid his father manage his business. Enríquez had also led an effort to rebuild the cathedral of San Juan. Despite being a mulatto, Enríquez owned several African slaves, which served as an assertion of his social status and performed his menual tasks. At least 50 were working in one of his haciendas, El Plantaje. Enríquez owned another hacienda, Ribiera del Bayamón, where he employed 49 black slaves. Of which he might have fathered a significant portion of 21, which shared his last name, with most also being named Miguel. The other option being that the parents of these children decided to adopt his name as a form of tribute for their master. He maintained this group with three plantations that amassed over 7,982 plants and 10,000 yards where yuca was cultivated. His haciendas were mostly dedicated to the support of his slaves, who in turn did most of the hard work that sustained his empire. Enríquez employed more in his workshops and the port, performing works that varied from carpenters and blacksmiths to moving cargo and supply ships that were about to set sail. Enríquez rarely bought these slaves and the few times <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> was through the advantages provided by the Royal Asiento or the Guinea Company. Most of them were actually acquired through his privateering vessels. Between 1716 and 1733, his ships captured over 176 slaves in this manner. The most successful was La Modista, which captured 79 from a British slaver and 16 from a Danish ship. Enríquez was the Puerto Rican that owned more slaves during his time and was reportedly harsh with them. His methods of discipline included holding them captive in his own private jail, food depravation and flailing. Between 1718 and 1720, several storms affected Puerto Rico, destroying the agriculture and causing a shortage of food and shelter. To further complicate matters, an epidemic was declared, causing the death of several patients. The residents of San Juan asked Enríquez to help, and he responded by donating 400 jars of melado (a type of food made from sugar and molasses) and an entire shipment of corn, which one of his ships had delivered. He also took over the funeral services of the poor that died, paying the Church personally.|$|E

Chris Owens who portrayed the Young Smoking Man spent time watching how Davis smokes to ensure <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> just like him.

500|$|Regardless, Lee {{received}} Goodman's {{approval for}} the name Spider-Man and the [...] "ordinary teen" [...] concept, and approached artist Jack Kirby. As comics historian Greg Theakston recounts, Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he had collaborated with Joe Simon in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby [...] "immediately sat down for a story conference", Theakston writes, and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages. Steve Ditko would be the inker. When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, [...] "I hated {{the way he was}} doing it! Not <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> badly—it just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic". Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory.

Nina is angry with Connor at first but tells her <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> for her so she could realise her potential. Nina's song wins the contest, but she is too shy to come forward, and Tahnee takes the credit instead. Connor takes Nina to the station and she admits that she wrote and sang the song. Nina then overcomes her fears to sing [...] "Born to Try" [...] for the crowd, which upsets Tahnee. Nina's prize is to sing at a nightclub; afterwards, she is approached by Glenn Wheatley, but she turns down his offer.|$|E

500|$|Brandon Teena was a trans {{man who was}} gang {{raped and}} murdered by two male acquaintances in December 1993, when he was 21. Kimberly Peirce, {{at the time a}} Columbia University film student, became {{interested}} in the case after reading a 1994 Village Voice article by Donna Minkowitz. Peirce became engrossed in Brandon's life and death; she said, [...] "the minute I read about Brandon, I fell in love. With the intensity of his desire to turn himself into a boy, the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> with no role models. The leap of imagination that this person took was completely overwhelming to me." [...] The sensationalist news coverage of the case prolonged her interest. Peirce said she looked beyond the brutality of the case and instead viewed the positive aspects of Brandon's life as part of what eventually causes his death. [...] She admired Brandon's audacity, ability to solve complicated problems, and what she perceived as the sense of fantasy invoked by his personality.|$|E
500|$|After the war, Butlin {{returned}} to England aboard a cattle ship, arriving in England with only £5 (2011:£) capital. He {{made his way}} to Tiverton in Devon where his uncle, Marshall Hill, was a well known showman. He purchased a hoopla stall from Hill, and ran it successfully. In later interviews Butlin claimed that he accidentally sawed the corners off his hoopla blocks, but some observers such as The Sunday Herald report <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> intentionally, displaying [...] "logic and business sense". In either case, Butlin's actions allowed patrons to have a much higher success rate (approximately 3 in 5 for each ring) and brought him more custom than his fellow stall holders. By contrast an average game would have odds of approximately 1 in 9 for each ring or 1 in 3 for a 3-ring game. Butlin's stall gave him less profit per customer than his competitors, but the increase in business gave him a bigger overall profit than theirs. He moved to London and set up a successful stall in Olympia outside the Christmas Circus run by Bertram Mills. By {{the end of the season}} Butlin had been so successful that he could afford to bring his mother (by then widowed) to the UK from Canada.|$|E
500|$|The flashbacks {{begin with}} Nikki Fernandez (Kiele Sanchez) {{acting in a}} popular, Charlie's Angels-like TV show Exposé filmed in Sydney, in which she is a guest star. She is also {{having an affair with}} the septuagenarian {{executive}} producer, Howard L. Zuckerman, who is very wealthy, while Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro) works as his chef. Paulo kills Zuckerman by poisoning his food, and the couple steals his diamonds, which are worth $8million. The couple plan on returning to the United States on Oceanic Flight 815, encountering Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) and Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) at the airport. Upon surviving the plane crash, Nikki and Paulo realize that they have lost the bag with the diamonds. Nikki consults Dr. Leslie Arzt (Daniel Roebuck), who tells her of a spider with the ability to paralyze people. He also gives her a trajectory map which leads them to [...] and the Nigerian plane; they explore neither. When Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) mentions that she found luggage from the plane in a lake, Paulo finds the diamonds, but does not tell Nikki. Instead, he hides them in the toilet at The Pearl and overhears a conversation between Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson). The two accidentally leave behind a walkie-talkie that Paulo takes. Later, when Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), Nikki and Paulo visit The Pearl, Paulo retrieves the diamonds by pretending to use the bathroom. Nikki figures out that Paulo has found the diamonds without telling her and decides to lure him into a trap. When he denies that he has the diamonds she unleashes one of the paralyzing spiders on him. She finds the diamonds and Paulo apologizes, claiming <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> so that she would not end their relationship. As Nikki stands in a state of regret, the pheromones of the female spider attract a group of the male spiders of the same species and she is bitten on her leg. She buries the diamonds and sprints to the beach.|$|E
