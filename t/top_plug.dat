50|$|A {{hydrostatic}} bailer functions like a 'vacuum', {{and is used}} to suck up unwanted solids {{from the}} wellbore. A hydrostatic bailer is generally around 2.5 meters long and is tubular looking, with two 10 mm holes on opposing sides {{at the top of}} the tool, and a hole in the bottom. A hydrostatic bailer uses a pinned plug with o-ring seals at the bottom, and a plug at the top to maintain the surface pressure that it was assembled at (nominally around 100 kPa) all the way to the bottom of the well, whereupon it is spudded into the downhole solids, which ideally pushes the shoe into the bottom plug, which shears the pin on the bottom plug. An oil or gas well's pressure downhole is always more than atmospheric pressure at surface, due to the formation pressure, and a combination of depth and hydrostatic weight of wellbore fluids. Sometimes fluid will be added to the wellbore to assist in bailing by bringing up the pressure, and also lubricating the downhole solid. Because the pressure inside the bailer is much less than the downhole wellbore pressure, any solids that are loose enough are 'sucked up' by the vacuum formed when the bottom plug is sheared and travels upwards through the barrel, followed by the solids. At the same time, due to the changed from negative pressure to positive pressure, the <b>top</b> <b>plug</b> pops out (and is caught by the top part of the tool), and excess flow is directed out through the 10 mm ports on the sides of the top of the tool. These ports allow the barrel to fill more readily. Then the bailer is returned to surface where it is taken apart, the solids are emptied, and it is cleaned and serviced with new o-ring seals. Care must be taken when disassembling at surface as the tool is potentially charged with the downhole pressure (possibly many tens of thousands of kpa) and may 'blow apart' when being unthreaded if not bled off first.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDuring the {{long-term}} {{operation of a}} conceptual multi-barrier deep geological repository for disposal of high-level nuclear waste, performance of the artificial barrier system (compacted bentonite) with consideration of influences of the surrounding rocks has to be evaluated {{for tens of thousands}} of years. Numerical simulation technology could be one of the most effective assessment methods. In order to have confidence in the prediction of the coupled hydraulic and mechanical processes occurring within the engineered clay barrier, a comparison between calculated and observed results is essential for validation and verification. For this purpose, a new Hydro-Mechanical (HM) device was designed in this paper, in which compacted GMZ 01 bentonite specimen was embedded into a hollow Beishan granite column, which was tightly fixed by a closure metal framework. Relative humidity and pressure sensors were employed for monitoring behavior of the compacted bentonite during hydration, in order to observe the HM coupling performance of the compacted bentonite with consideration of influences of surrounding rocks at room temperature.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{demonstrate}} how seismic waves propagate in wells, and to investigate the potential of using borehole seismic {{as an alternative to}} conventional cement plug verification. An alternative verification method might be necessary to perform full plug and abandonment (P&A) operations from riserless light well intervention (RLWI) vessels. Testing, verification and monitoring of technical barrier elements are important to maintain well integrity. The barrier situation has to be kept under control in all phases of a well's lifetime. The focus on long-term integrity is increasing as more wells are getting ready to be plugged and abandoned. New and more effective P&A solutions are desired by the industry. Rigless P&A operations would save time and cost, but current technology does not allow RLWI vessels to do the entire operation. The work in this thesis is based on previous work where it is suggested how to place cement plugs in a well using a vessel. To act {{as a part of the}} barrier envelope, the plug needs to be verified and tested according to the NORSOK D- 010 requirements. Tagging is often used for cement plug verification. Conventional tagging operations are not possible from RLWI vessels, and this thesis suggests borehole seismic as an alternative solution for cement plug verification. The alternative verification method is based on generating pressure waves using a seismic source, and detecting the reflection from the cement plug using receivers run on wireline. By doing this it might be possible to verify both the <b>top</b> of the <b>plug</b> and the cement integrity. To investigate the wave propagation and reflections from the plug, well models were created in MATLAB. The models were imported to the Madagscar software, and a 2 D finite difference method was used to model the wave propagation. The wave response from different cement plug scenarios are simulated by adjusting the models and input parameters. These scenarios include plugs with varying degree of cement settling and mud contamination. To confine the simulation time and to avoid numerical instabilities, the model had to be simplified. This has increased the uncertainty in the results. Using the simulation result, the depth of the <b>top</b> of the <b>plug</b> and the wave velocity in the cement were calculated with small errors. Knowing the cement velocity might make it possible to determine the grade of cement hydration. When mud contaminated the <b>top</b> of the <b>plug,</b> the <b>top</b> was not easily identified. The precision of the results is dependent on the frequencies used in the simulations. Tube waves are expected to have great importance when using borehole seismic for plug verification. The result could not identify these types of waves. A reason for this might be that the modeling is in 2 D while the well is 3 D. To make final conclusions on the potential of the alternative verification method, new simulation tools fitted for well modeling should be developed. Field experiments could also give valuable results. The optimal frequency range for cement plug verification has to be determined through a more detailed study. Solving the verification challenge is only one step on the way towards completely rigless P&A operations. Remaining challenges include problems related to tubing removal, logging behind several casing strings, and control line identification and removal. </p...|$|R

40|$|This section {{describes}} the structural {{evaluation of the}} NUHOMS®- 32 PT system. The NUHOMS®- 32 PT system consists of the NUHOMS ® HSM, the OS 197 and OS 197 H TCs, and the 32 PT DSC basket and shell assemblies. No changes {{have been made to}} the HSM or the OS 197 or OS 197 H TCs to accommodate the 32 PT DSC. Where the new components {{have an effect on the}} structural evaluations presented in the FSAR, the changes are included in this section. Sections that do not effect the evaluations presented in the FSAR include a statement that there is no change to the FSAR. In addition, a complete evaluation of the 32 PT DSC shell and basket components has been performed and is summarized in this section. The 32 PT DSC shell assembly is shown on drawings NUH- 32 PT- 1001 and NUH- 32 PT- 1002. These drawings are provided in Section M. 1. 5. The NUHOMS®- 32 PT DSC shell assembly is the same as the NUHOMS®- 24 P DSC with the following exceptions: " * The nominal DSC shell thickness has been reduced to 0. 5 inch thick from 0. 625 inch thick. " * The nominal thickness of the outer top cover plate has been increased from 1. 25 inches to 1. 50 inches. " * The nominal thickness of the inner top cover plate has been increased from 0. 75 inches to 1. 25 inches. " The nominal thickness of the inner bottom cover plate has been increased from 0. 75 inches to 1. 75 inches and has been designed for the internal pressure loads without credit taken for the structural support of the bottom shield plug and outer bottom cover plate. " The nominal thickness of the <b>top</b> shield <b>plug</b> has been reduced from 8. 25 inches to 6. 25 inches for the 32 PT-S 100 and 32 PT-L 100 and to 7. 5 inches for the 32 PT-S 125 and 32 PT L 125. " * The nominal thickness of the bottom shield plug has been reduced from 6. 25 inches to 4. 00 inches for the 32 PT-S 100 and 32 PT-L 100 and to 5. 25 inches for the 32 PT-S 125 and 32 PT L 125. " An optional configuration has been added for the inner bottom cover plate that allows the use of a forging to provide the same structural function as the plate design. " A test port has been added to the top cover plate to allow testing of the inner top cover plate welds and vent and siphon port cover plate welds to a leak tight criteria...|$|R
40|$|A {{system is}} {{proposed}} for packaging material samples {{on a remote}} planet (especially Mars) in sealed sample tubes in preparation for later return to Earth. The sample tubes (Figure 1) would comprise (1) tubes initially having open tops and closed bottoms; (2) small, bellows-like collapsible bodies inside the tubes at their bottoms; and (3) plugs to be eventually used to close {{the tops of the}} tubes. The top inner surface of each tube would be coated with solder. The side of each plug, which would fit snugly into a tube, would feature a solder-filled ring groove. The system would include equipment for storing, manipulating, filling, and sealing the tubes. The containerization system (see Figure 2) will be organized in stations and will include: the storage station, the loading station, and the heating station. These stations can be structured in circular or linear pattern to minimize the manipulator complexity, allowing for compact design and mass efficiency. The manipulation of the sample tube between stations is done by a simple manipulator arm. The storage station contains the unloaded sample tubes and the plugs before sealing as well as the sealed sample tubes with samples after loading and sealing. The chambers at the storage station also allow for plug insertion into the sample tube. At the loading station the sample is poured or inserted into the sample tube and then the tube is topped off. At the heating station the plug is heated so the solder ring melts and seals the plug to the sample tube. The process is performed as follows: Each tube is filled or slightly overfilled with sample material and the excess sample material is wiped off the <b>top.</b> Then, the <b>plug</b> is inserted into the top section of the tube packing the sample material against the collapsible bellowslike body allowing the accommodation of the sample volume. The <b>plug</b> and the <b>top</b> of the tube are heated momentarily to melt the solder in order to seal the tube...|$|R
