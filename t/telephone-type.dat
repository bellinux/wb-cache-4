2500|$|The US Army Bombe was {{physically}} {{very different from}} the British and US Navy bombes. A contract was signed with Bell Labs on 30 September 1942. The machine was designed to analyse 3-rotor, not 4-rotor traffic. It was known as [...] "003" [...] or [...] "Madame X". It did not use drums to represent the Enigma rotors, using instead <b>telephone-type</b> relays. It could, however, handle one problem that the bombes with drums could not. The set of ten bombes consisted of a total of 144 Enigma-equivalents, each mounted on a rack approximately [...] long [...] high and [...] wide. There were 12 control stations which could allocate any of the Enigma-equivalents into the desired configuration by means of plugboards. Rotor order changes did not require the mechanical process of changing drums, but was achieved in about half a minute by means of push buttons. A 3-rotor run took about 10 minutes.|$|E

5000|$|... a {{transmitter}} can automatically call {{a receiver}} equipped with Digital Selective Calling, using a <b>telephone-type</b> number {{known as a}} Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI). The DSC information is sent on the reserved Channel 70. When the receiver picks up the call, their active channel is automatically switched to the transmitter's channel and normal voice communication can proceed.|$|E
50|$|For {{instrumentation}} use, James Cunningham, Son and Company made high-speed, very-long-life crossbar switches with physically small {{mechanical parts}} which permitted faster operation than <b>telephone-type</b> crossbar switches. Many of their switches had the mechanical Boolean AND function of telephony crossbar switches, but other models had individual relays (one coil per crosspoint) in matrix arrays, connecting the relay contacts to x and y buses. These latter types were equivalent to separate relays; {{there was no}} logical AND function built in. Cunningham crossbar switches had precious-metal contacts capable of handling millivolt signals.|$|E
50|$|US cryptanalysts {{had broken}} several Japanese {{diplomatic}} ciphers, but, without ever seeing the PURPLE machine {{until after the}} war, they deduced the logic. Purple was actually mechanically simpler than Enigma, but the U.S. Army team struggled with a mechanical reproduction until Leo Rosen had the unexplained insight that the critical building block in the Purple machine was a <b>telephone-type</b> stepping switch rather than the rotor used in Enigma and in more advanced U.S. and UK machines. Rosen, Frank Rowlett, and others of the team recognized Rosen's insight as based on nothing but a communication engineer's intuition.|$|E
50|$|James Cunningham, Son and Company was an American {{business}} {{based in}} Rochester, New York, initially manufacturing horse-drawn coaches, it eventually {{went on to}} develop and produce motorized automobiles from 1908 onward. The Cunningham company was a pioneer in automobile production credited with being one the world's first developers and manufacturers of automobiles {{and one of the}} first car-makers to produce an American V8 engine automobile, in 1916. The company also developed the M1 Armored Car (T24), tested by the Ordnance Department in 1931.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a measurement technique {{for the assessment}} of the degree of quality of facsimile transmissions over a <b>telephone-type</b> network that can be performed while the communication lines are in use. The main impairments introduced by the telecommunication channel are continuously measured by using a blind equalization technique and a timing recovery system, thus assuring a high accuracy with a reasonable measurement time, even under poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

40|$|A noise-insensitive {{technique}} for the discrimination between speech and voice-band data transmissions over a <b>telephone-type</b> system is presented. The proposed procedure combines together {{the evaluation of}} some meaningful parameters extracted from the observed speech or data communication signal, with {{an analysis of the}} statistical moments associated with these parameters. In this way, the discrimination capability associated with the extracted parameters is enforced by the moment analysis that better exploits the time-varying properties of speech signals. Experimental results, that show the good behavior of the classifier in terms of probability of error with respect to signal-to-noise ratio, are reported and discusse...|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To study {{immediate}} early gene, c-fos, {{expression as}} a marker of neural stress after whole of gestation exposure of the fetal mouse brain to mobile <b>telephone-type</b> radiofrequency fields. METHODS: Using a purpose-designed exposure system at 900 MHz, pregnant mice were given a single, far-field, whole body exposure at a specific absorption rate of 4 W/kg for 60 min/day from day 1 to day 19 of gestation. Pregnant control mice were sham-exposed or freely mobile in a cage without further restraint. Immediately prior to parturition on gestational day 19, fetal heads were collected, fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and paraffin embedded. Any stress response in the brain was detected by c-fos immunohistochemistry in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, midbrain, cerebellum and medulla. RESULTS: c-fos expression was of limited, but consistent, neuroanatomical distribution {{and there was no}} difference in immunoreactivity between exposed and control brains. CONCLUSION: In this animal model, no stress response was detected in the fetal brain using c-fos immunohistochemistry after whole of gestation exposure to mobile telephony...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{study the}} effect of {{long-term}} exposure to global system for mobile communication (GSM) radiofrequency fields on vascular permeability in murine brains. METHODS: Using a purpose-designed exposure system at 900 MHz, mice were given a 60 -minute far-field, whole body exposure on each of 5 days per week for 104 weeks at specific absorption rates (SAR) of 0. 25, 1. 0, 2. 0 and 4. 0 W/kg. Control mice were sham-exposed or permitted free movement in a cage to evaluate any stress-related effects. Albumin immunohistochemistry was used to detect increased vascular permeability and {{the efficacy of the}} vascular tracer was confirmed with a positive control group exposed to a clostridial toxin known to increase vascular permeability in the brain. RESULTS: In all exposed and control groups, albumin extravasation was minimal, often leptomeningeal, and was deemed insignificant as a maximum of three capillaries or venules in a given brain showed leakage from the very many blood vessels present in the three coronal brain sections. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that prolonged exposure to mobile <b>telephone-type</b> radiation produces negligible disruption to blood-brain barrier integrity at the light microscope level using endogenous albumin as a vascular tracer...|$|E
