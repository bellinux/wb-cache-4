5|$|On 20 December 2005, Minister for Justice Michael McDowell {{announced}} that he was creating a working group in the Department of Justice to provide options for government consideration. This announcement came on the day after Belfast in Northern Ireland held the first of the new UK civil partnership registration ceremonies. The Government said that it would legislate following the report, but Taoiseach Bertie Ahern also said <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> time to do so before the then upcoming election.|$|E
5|$|If {{this were}} not enough, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} that simple radar reflectors could be launched along with the warhead that would be indistinguishable to Zeus' radars. This problem was first alluded to in 1958 in public talks that mentioned Zeus' inability to discriminate targets. If the decoys spread apart further than the lethal radius of the Zeus' warhead, several interceptors {{will be required to}} guarantee that the warhead hiding among the decoys will be destroyed. Decoys are lightweight, and would slow down when they began to reenter the upper atmosphere, allowing them to be picked out, or decluttered. But by that time it would be so close to the Zeus base that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> time for the Zeus to climb to altitude.|$|E

Without greed, {{there might not}} have been the need of medieval man to fight for more territory.

25|$|Any {{candidate}} {{theory of}} quantum gravity {{must be able}} to reproduce Einstein's theory of general relativity as a classical limit of a quantum theory. This is not guaranteed because of a feature of quantum field theories which is that they have different sectors, these are analogous to the different phases that come about in the thermodynamical limit of statistical systems. Just as different phases are physically different, so are different sectors of a quantum field theory. It may turn out that LQG belongs to an unphysical sector – one in which one does not recover general relativity in the semiclassical limit (in fact <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> any physical sector at all).|$|E
2500|$|Emulations {{could create}} a number of {{conditions}} that might increase risk of war, including inequality, changes of power dynamics, a possible technological arms race to build emulations first, first-strike advantages, strong loyalty and willingness to [...] "die" [...] among emulations, and triggers for racist, xenophobic, and religious prejudice. If emulations run much faster than humans, <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> enough time for human leaders to make wise decisions or negotiate. It's possible that humans would react violently against growing power of emulations, especially if they depress human wages. Or maybe emulations wouldn't trust each other, and even well intentioned defensive measures might be interpreted as offense.|$|E

5000|$|After Armenulić's death, {{friends said}} that she often worried about her fate. In October 1971 {{she was in a}} car {{accident}} that almost claimed her life, and which irresistibly recalls the tragedy that took her life five years later. Three months after the accident, she said, [...] "I am a big pessimist. I'm afraid of life. The future. What will happen tomorrow. I fear that, for me, <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> even <b>be</b> a tomorrow...." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were some}} {{horsemen}} in the court, and many attendants on foot, who {{came forward and}} assisted the guests to alight. Tancred and Fakredeen did not speak, but exchanged glances which expressed their secret thoughts. Perhaps they were of the same opinion as Baroni, that, difficult {{as it was to}} arrive <b>there,</b> it <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> more easy to return. However, God is great! a consolatory truth that had sustained Baroni under many trials.|$|R
2500|$|The {{alveolar}} bone surrounding one tooth will naturally surround an adjacent tooth, and removing bone for a crown lengthening procedure will effectively damage [...] the bony support of adjacent teeth to some inevitable extent, {{as well as}} unfavorably increase the crown-to-root ratio. [...] Additionally, once bone is removed, {{it is almost impossible}} to regain it to previous levels, and in case a patient would like to have an implant placed in the future, <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> enough bone in the region once a crown lengthening procedure has been completed. [...] Thus, it would be prudent for patients to thoroughly discuss all of their treatment planning options with their dentist before undergoing an irreversible procedure such as crown lengthening.|$|E
2500|$|About.com's Carew felt Prayers on Fire {{was able}} to [...] "capture the qualities of their infamous live-shows on record ... the evocatively-produced set dared dress key cuts in blaring brass; giving a sense of perverted-cabaret to their mordant racket, turning Cave from nihilist, self-destructive savant to theatrical, {{flamboyant}} showman". Allmusic's Greg Maurer's found [...] "a fascination with the dark, (self-)destructive side of religion is more than evident in his later work... While <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> any of the explicit Biblical imagery on [...] that Cave would later ejaculate, the title ... is apt". McFarlane stated it showed the band was [...] "irrevocably and unashamedly changing for the better, being more aggressive than anything they had ever recorded". Sound Stage Direct described it as [...] "a creepy carnival of tribal rhythms, wonky discordance and garbled surrealism". Music critic, Ed St John summarised, [...] "this is an expression which ebbs out {{beyond the confines of}} proficiently played music ... is akin to watching a film of Jackson Pollock painting or listening to Dylan Thomas in full alcoholic flight".|$|E

50|$|At {{the height}} of the {{marketing}} effort, Team OS/2 consisted of more than ten thousand known members, and countless undocumented members. IBM acknowledged publicly that without Team OS/2, <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> a fourth generation ("Warp 4") of the operating system. However, the IBM Marketing Director over the Grass Roots Marketing Department made the decision to meet his headcount cut targets by eliminating the entire department - one week before the 1995 Fall Comdex. Microsoft executives were said to be positively gleeful and Team OS/2 members worldwide were said to be incredulous.|$|R
50|$|The novels {{were adapted}} into five manga series: three {{illustrated}} by Yū Yoshii, and one each drawn by Tetsu and Akiyo Kurosawa. Deep Love {{has also had}} two live-action series air on TV Tokyo: Ayu no Monogatari (2004) and Host (2005). A live-action film was released in theaters in 2004. Literary critic Minako Saitō panned the novels, suggesting that {{if it had been}} entered into a new writer competition in a literary magazine, it would have been rejected in the first round. She {{goes on to say that}} <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> even <b>be</b> any need to review such a work.|$|R

6000|$|... "I have no {{intention}} of preaching socialism," [...] said Hodder. But he laid a slight emphasis on the word which sent a cold shiver down Mr. Plimpton's spine, and made him wonder whether <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> something worse than socialism.|$|E

The girl began to wonder if <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> possibly <b>be</b> a vein of nobility in the man, after all, that she had never discovered. Since she had entered his apartments at Blentz he had been in every way a different man from the Leopold she had known of old. The boldness of his escape from Blentz supposed a courage that the king had never given the slightest indication of in the past. Could it be that he was making a genuine effort to become a man--to win her respect? ...|$|R
30|$|Given {{the recent}} {{volatile}} nature of dairy commodity prices, {{there exists a}} perceived threat that these commodities may be replaced by cheaper substitutes. This is underlined in FAO and OECD (2011 a) which states “Under very high prices, demand may retreat and dairy ingredients can be replaced by cheaper substitutes in food manufacturing”. This statement suggests that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> only <b>be</b> spatial transmission effects among different regions but also between dairy commodities and substitutes, such as vegetable oils for butter. This substitution effect is reported in Keane and O’Connor (2009). However, there may be limits to this, especially in the short-term, {{because of the large}} investment required in product reformulation.|$|R
40|$|Macro-operator (“macro”, for short) {{generation}} {{is a well-known}} technique {{that is used to}} speed-up the planning process. Most published work on using macros in automated planning relies on an offline learning phase where training plans, that is, solutions of simple problems, are used to generate the macros. However, <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> always <b>be</b> a place to accommodate training. In this paper we propose OMA, an efficient method for generating useful macros without an offline learning phase, by utilising lessons learnt from existing macro learning techniques. Empirical evaluation with IPC benchmarks demonstrates performance improvement in a range of state-of-the-art planning engines, and provides insights into what macros can be generated without training...|$|R

The {{boundaries}} were originally blurred: at one point, the Hot Rods and the Sex Pistols were both considered rival kings of [...] "street rock". The Pistols played support slots for the Blockheads and the 101ers at the Nashville. Their big break was supporting Eddie and the Hot Rods at the Marquee in Feb 1976. Dr. Feelgood played with the Ramones in New York. The word [...] "punk" [...] debuted on Top of the Pops on a T-shirt worn by a Hot Rod. Punk fanzine Sniffin' Glue reviewed Feelgood album Stupidity as [...] "the way rock should be".|$|R

If little Pearl were entertained with faith and trust, as a spirit messenger no less than an earthly child, <b>might</b> it <b>not</b> <b>be</b> her errand to soothe away the sorrow that lay cold in her mother's heart, and converted it into a tomb?--and to help her to overcome the passion, once so wild, and even yet neither dead nor asleep, but only imprisoned within the same tomb-like heart? ...|$|R
60|$|Mulford {{took his}} {{distance}} with a seaman's eye, {{and the boat}} went about like a top. The latter fell off, and the sail filled on the other tack. Then the young mariner saw, with a joy no description can pourtray, that he looked to windward of the fluttering shawl, toward which his little craft was already flying. He afterward believed that shawl alone prevented the voracious party of fish from assailing those on the wreck, for, though <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> yet <b>be</b> sufficient depth of water to allow of their customary mode of attack, creatures of their voracity did not always wait for such conveniences. But the boat was soon {{in the midst of}} the fins, scattering them in all directions; and Mulford let go his sheet, put his helm down, and sprang forward to catch the extended arms of Rose.|$|R
