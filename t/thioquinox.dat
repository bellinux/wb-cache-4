40|$|Quinoxaline, organotin, organofluorine, and {{formamidine}} compounds {{are among}} the newer pesticide chemicals used for acarine control. Included in these four classes {{are some of the}} most selective synthetic organic toxicants currently in the acaricide/insecticide arsenal. Oxythioquinox, Plictran (tricyclohexylhydroxytin), Nissol [2 -fluoro-N-methyl-N-(l-naphthyl) acetamide], and chlordimeform are examples of quinoxaline, organotin, organofluorine, and formamidine acaricides, respectively. The chemistry and toxicology of these and related compounds are discussed. Several of the newer synthetic organic or "second generation " acaricides are widely used for control of phytophagous mites and ticks. Certain of these compounds also have insecticidal and fungicidal activity. This paper reviews some of the existing data derived from studies of the chemistry and toxicology of the quinoxaline, organotin, organofluorine, and formamidine compounds. Quinoxaline Compounds A systematic study of the sulfur-containing quinoxaline compounds conducted in Germany indicated that cyclic dithiocarbonates usually had higher initial toxicity to spider mites than trithiocarbonates (Table 1) (1). The efficacy depended largely upon the nature of the substituents in the benzene nucleus of the quinoxaline skeleton. <b>Thioquinox</b> and oxythioquinox (Table 1) were the two most promising compounds; however, the former compound was not used primarily because of its skin sensitizing activity. Oxythioquinox or Morestan has a broad spectrum of miticidal activity and also is active against some insects and fungi (1, 2). It is prepared by the condensation o...|$|E
