5|$|During Harrison's administration, the Lakota Sioux, {{previously}} {{confined to}} reservations in South Dakota, grew restive {{under the influence}} of Wovoka, a medicine man, who encouraged them to participate in a spiritual movement called <b>the</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>Dance.</b> Many in Washington did not understand the predominantly religious nature of <b>the</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>Dance,</b> and thought it was a militant movement being used to rally Native Americans against the government. On December 29, 1890, troops from the Seventh Cavalry clashed with the Sioux at Wounded Knee. The result was a massacre of at least 146 Sioux, including many women and children; the dead Sioux were buried in a mass grave. In reaction Harrison directed Major General Nelson A. Miles to investigate and ordered 3500 federal troops to South Dakota; the uprising was brought to an end. Wounded Knee is considered the last major American Indian battle in the 19th century. Harrison's general policy on American Indians was to encourage assimilation into white society and, despite the massacre, he believed the policy to have been generally successful. This policy, known as the allotment system and embodied in the Dawes Act, was favored by liberal reformers at the time, but eventually proved detrimental to American Indians as they sold most of their land at low prices to white speculators.|$|E
5|$|After he {{returned}} to the United States, 22-year-old Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox, his high school girlfriend and classmate since kindergarten, on September 1, 1945. The pair relocated to Chicago; there, Vonnegut enrolled in the University of Chicago as an anthropology student (in an unusual five-year joint undergraduate/graduate program that only conferred the higher master's degree) on the G.I. Bill. He augmented his income by working as a reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago at night. Jane accepted a scholarship from the university to study Russian literature as a graduate student. Jane dropped out of the program after becoming pregnant with the couple's first child, Mark (born May 1947), while Kurt also left the University without any degree (despite having completed his undergraduate education) when his master's thesis on <b>the</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>Dance</b> religious movement was unanimously rejected by the department.|$|E

25|$|During this time, news {{spread among}} the {{reservations}} of a Paiute prophet named Wovoka, founder of <b>the</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>Dance</b> religion. He {{had a vision}} that the Christian Messiah, Jesus Christ, had returned to Earth {{in the form of}} a Native American.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>Dance</b> spread {{throughout}} the Plains tribes in the 1890s and many songs are sung today. They are characterized by relaxed vocals and a narrow range. Apache-derived peyote songs, prayers in the Native American Church, use a descending melody and monophony. Rattles and water drums are used, in a swift tempo. The Sun Dance and Grass Dance of the plains are the roots of intertribal powwows, which feature music with terraced descent and nasal vocals, both Plains characteristic features.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} Native American tribes, the Pawnee had a {{cosmology}} with elements {{of all of}} nature represented in it. They based many rituals in the four cardinal directions. Pawnee priests conducted ceremonies based on the sacred bundles that included various materials, such as an ear of sacred corn, with great symbolic value. These were used in many religious ceremonies to maintain the balance {{of nature and the}} Pawnee relationship with the gods and spirits. In the 1890s, already in Oklahoma, the people participated in <b>the</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>Dance</b> movement.|$|E

Though he and his unit did not {{participate}} in the Wounded Knee Massacre, they did fight three days after it on January 1, 1891 when Sioux warriors attacked the 6th Cavalry's supply wagons. When the Sioux began firing at the wagons, Pershing and his troops heard the shots, and rode more than six miles to the location of the attack. The cavalry fired at the forces of Chief War Eagle, causing them to retreat. This would be the only occasion where Pershing would see action in <b>the</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>Dance</b> campaign.|$|E

25|$|Many tribal music {{cultures}} have a relative paucity of traditional women's songs and dances, {{especially in the}} Northeast and Southeast regions. The Southeast is, however, home to a prominent women's musical tradition {{in the use of}} leg rattles for ceremonial stomp and friendship dances, and the women's singing during Horse and Ball Game contests. The West Coast tribes of North America tend to more prominence in women's music, with special women's love songs, medicine songs and handgame songs; the Southwest is particularly diverse in women's musical offerings, with major ceremonial, instrumental and social roles in dances. Women also play a vital ceremonial role in the Sun Dance of the Great Plains and Great Basin, and sing during social dances. Shoshone women still sang the songs of <b>the</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>Dance</b> into the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|Sitting Bull ( [...] in Standard Lakota Orthography, also nicknamed Húŋkešni [...] or [...] "Slow"; [...] c. 1831– December 15, 1890) was a Hunkpapa Lakota {{holy man}} who led his people during years of {{resistance}} to United States government policies.

500|$|After {{working as}} a {{performer}} with Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency in South Dakota. Because of fears that he would use his influence to support <b>the</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>Dance</b> movement, Indian Service agent James McLaughlin at Fort Yates ordered his arrest. During an ensuing struggle between Sitting Bull's followers and the agency police, Sitting Bull {{was shot in the}} side and head by Standing Rock policemen Lieutenant Bull Head (Tatankapah, [...] ) and Red Tomahawk (Marcelus Chankpidutah, [...] ) after the police were fired upon by Sitting Bull's supporters. His body was taken to nearby Fort Yates for burial. In 1953, his Lakota family exhumed what were believed to be his remains, reburying them near Mobridge, South Dakota, near his birthplace.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>Dance</b> religion, {{as practiced}} by a Northern Paiute named Wovoka made its {{influence}} felt among the Arapaho at this time. Wovoka {{was the son}} of a prophet named Tavibo, and according to historian James Mooney, was considered [...] "The Messiah" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>Dance.</b> The Cheyenne first learned about this Messiah in 1889. He was alleged to live near the Shoshone in Wyoming and would bring back the buffalo and remove the white people from tribal land. A delegation led by Porcupine was sent to observe <b>the</b> <b>Ghost</b> <b>Dance.</b> In his account upon their return, Porcupine had become a full believer in both the Messiah and the dance. When questioned by the military authority, Porcupine gave a total accounting, but Mooney notes that in his enthusiasm, Porcupine might have embellished a bit. Some abandoned their work in favor of the dancing. Agent Ashley tried to put a halt to it.|$|E
