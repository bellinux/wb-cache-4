50|$|The small-step work {{improvement}} {{approach was}} developed in the USA under <b>Training</b> <b>Within</b> <b>Industry</b> program (TWI Job Methods). Instead of encouraging large, radical changes to achieve desired goals, these methods recommended that organizations introduce small improvements, preferably ones that could be implemented on the same day. The major reason was that during WWII there was neither time nor resources for large and innovative changes in the production of war equipment. The essence of the approach came down to improving the use of the existing workforce and technologies.|$|E
50|$|The JIT {{workflow}} of Toyota {{had this}} problem of tools changeover took between two and eight hours, Toyota could neither afford the lost production time nor the enormous lot sizes suggested by the economic order quantity. Lot reduction and set up time reduction had actually been ongoing in TPS since 1945 when Taiichi Ohno became manager of the machine shops in Toyota. On {{a trip to the}} US in 1955, Taiichi Ohno observed Danly stamping presses with rapid die change capability. Subsequently, Toyota bought multiple Danly presses for the Motomachi plant. And Toyota started to work on improving the changeover time of their presses. This was known as Quick Die Change, or QDC for short. They developed a structured approach based on a framework from the US World War II <b>Training</b> <b>within</b> <b>Industry</b> (TWI) program, called ECRS - Eliminate, Combine, Rearrange, and Simplify.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Training</b> <b>Within</b> <b>Industry</b> (TWI) {{service was}} created by the United States Department of War, running from 1940 to 1945 within the War Manpower Commission. The purpose was to provide {{consulting}} services to war-related industries whose personnel were being conscripted into the US Army {{at the same time the}} War Department was issuing orders for additional matériel. It was apparent that the shortage of trained and skilled personnel at precisely the time they were needed most would impose a hardship on those industries, and that only improved methods of job training would address the shortfall. [...] By the end of World War II, over 1.6 million workers in over 16,500 plants had received a certification. The program continued post-war in Europe and Asia, where it aided reconstruction. It is most notable in the business world for inspiring the concept of kaizen in Japan.|$|E
50|$|Type {{design is}} {{performed}} by a type designer. It is a craft, blending elements of art and science. In the pre-digital era it was primarily learned through apprenticeship and professional <b>training</b> <b>within</b> the <b>industry.</b> Since the mid-1990s {{it has become the}} subject of dedicated degree programs at a handful of universities, including the MA Typeface Design at the University of Reading (UK) and the Type Media program at the KABK (Royal Academy of Art in the Hague). At the same time, the transition to digital type and font editors which can be inexpensive (or even open source and free) has led to a great democratization of type design; the craft is accessible to anyone with the interest to pursue it, nevertheless, it may take a very long time for the serious artist to master.|$|R

This paper reflects back and reviews the introduction of such <b>training</b> <b>within</b> the construction <b>industry</b> in Western Australia as it adapts to the additional pressures of the development boom. This paper reviews the impact of such training on the commerical sector of the industry, the training organisations and the employees, using a mixed methods study reviewing both stakeholder perceptions and accident statistics.

People would be able to change their point of view to perform the product target and in the same time the goals of training.

40|$|Outsourcing of {{customer}} {{and other services}} to developing countries is a significant aspect of global commercial activity, and an area of explosive employment growth in many locations, such as India and the Philippines. The present paper investigates {{what is meant by}} the term ‘quality’ and the language choices made by Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) in outbound credit collection calls. The data is based on a case study undertaken in a call centre in the Philippines. We focus specifically on an analysis of authentic calls and how the language choices relate to calls being assessed <b>within</b> the <b>industry</b> as ‘good’, ‘average’ and ‘poor’. The analysis of the transcribed data revealed that the speech functions and the choice of ‘Mood’ – i. e. whether a clause is a declarative, interrogative or imperative – were important features of the call, and that these choices were related to the assessment of calls being labelled as ‘good’ or ‘poor’ calls. An understanding of what a ‘good’ call looks like can help inform the quality assurance and <b>training</b> practices <b>within</b> the <b>industry.</b> Department of Englis...|$|R
40|$|Since 1991 cleaner {{production}} {{projects have}} been pursued by the donors in Eastern European industry. These projects have aimed at demonstrating {{the benefits of a}} preventive approach to environmental protection, and to <b>train</b> people <b>within</b> the <b>industry</b> to perform the cleaner production assessments that constitute the core element of the preventive approach. The large merit of the preventive approach is the contribution to economical performance of the organization {{while at the same time}} reducing the environmental impact. Despite the benefits, the support for this area remains very small compared to other areas of environmental support. This dissertation shows how the promotion of cleaner production is affected by different factors, both external to the company and internally. Among those factors, the donor-supported efforts, where implemented, constitute an important contribution to the process of restructuring. The contribution in the dissertation lies, besides in clarifying the factors that influence the process of promotion of cleaner production in the region, also in the development of strategies for the donors for the further promotion of cleaner production...|$|R
40|$|Educational {{attainment}} varies greatly across {{countries and}} within countries over time. This paper asks whether {{the variation in}} education is primarily due to industry composition or to <b>within</b> <b>industry</b> skill intensities. The main finding is that <b>within</b> <b>industry</b> variation accounts for at least two-thirds of the cross-country and the time series variation in educational attainment. The <b>within</b> <b>industry</b> education gaps are broadly consistent with a model of industry neutral cross-country differences in skilled labor productivity. These results suggest that theories of educational development should focus on skill upgrading <b>within</b> <b>industries</b> rather than structural change.

40|$|The current {{economic}} difficulties have affected most practitioners <b>within</b> the <b>industry</b> and, as a result, many firms and contractors are bidding for fewer projects, resulting in below-cost tenders. It is clear that, many firms and contractors are now operating on thin margins; {{which makes it}} increasingly {{difficult for them to}} commit to the introduction of new software applications and system upgrades. The transition to Building Information Modelling (BIM) from traditional 2 D CAD by Irish firms and contractors has been a relatively slow process compared with our international colleagues. There are many reasons for this, including lack of resources, lack of awareness, ignorance, misunderstanding and adversity. The lack of BIM promotion and BIM <b>training</b> opportunities <b>within</b> the <b>industry</b> has meant that very few people possess the basic requirement to successfully embrace BIM at a level which would be considered efficient. BIM is the new way of operating and it is gaining momentum; the industry simply cannot {{turn a blind eye to}} the technology or it will be left behind. The industry must therefore adapt and change current working practices in order to compete with other established and recognized BIM nations. This paper will evaluate BIM in the international context and, investigate if these methodologies can be transferred to the Irish construction industry. This paper will also aim to identify obstacles and drivers for Irish firms, contractors and Government Departments with regard to BIM adoption, as well as the behavioural and cultural elements which are preventing BIM adoption in Ireland. It is hoped that the research findings will demonstrate a business case for the implementation of BIM, for both public and private sector organization...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT Previous {{research}} has highlighted {{the need for}} engineers to have some background knowledge of Indigenous Australian history, cultures and politics (Goldfinch, Ilango, Roland, and Willis, 2014; Leigh et al., 2015). This is particularly important where project engineers hold responsibility for developing or implementing Aboriginal cultural heritage management plans (Furry, 2015; Hartley, 2015) and compliance with relevant legislation (NSW Government, 2010; 2014). Engineering projects are often enabled, delayed, or significantly altered {{as a result of}} how sites and artefacts of significance are managed. At this stage, it is believed that engineers often negotiate these challenges with little to no training in Aboriginal cultural heritage. PURPOSE This study sought to quantify recent engineering graduates 2 ̆ 7 level of <b>training</b> received <b>within</b> <b>industry,</b> supplemented by what is being taught in tertiary education for negotiating Aboriginal cultural heritage. APPROACH An online survey of engineering graduates was developed and distributed within Young Engineers Australia, student society, and Engineers Without Borders networks. The survey canvassed graduates 2 ̆ 7 field and type of work, their experience with cultural heritage management and management plans, and the extent and type of education and training they have had in this area. Reconciliation action plans and Graduate Attribute statements of education providers and major engineering employers were also analysed {{to determine the extent of}} commitments to ongoing training of students and graduates. RESULTS Survey results indicate that it is common for young engineers to encounter Aboriginal cultural heritage on engineering project sites. In addition, survey participants received little formal education on Aboriginal cultural heritage beyond high school, and reported low levels of confidence in dealing with such heritage matters. It is also clear that not enough is happening within engineering education to address this need. CONCLUSIONS It appears that education and training is lagging behind legislated requirements for engineers and project managers. With the continued growth of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s population, large infrastructure projects will continue to impact on Aboriginal cultural heritage. Young engineers will need to be prepared to meet changing legal and societal expectations for the preservation of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s Aboriginal heritage...|$|R
