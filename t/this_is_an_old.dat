25|$|Percussive pacing, {{also known}} as transthoracic {{mechanical}} pacing, {{is the use of}} the closed fist, usually on the left lower edge of the sternum over the right ventricle in the vena cava, striking from a distance of 20 – 30cm to induce a ventricular beat (the British Journal of Anaesthesia suggests this must be done to raise the ventricular pressure to 10–15mmHg to induce electrical activity). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> procedure used only as a life saving means until an electrical pacemaker is brought to the patient.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the strongest}} {{objection}} to cochlear implants has come from within the Deaf community, {{some of whom are}} pre-lingually deaf people whose first language is a sign language. For some in the Deaf community, cochlear implants are an affront to their culture, which, as they view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> problem for the deaf community, going back as far as the 18th century with the argument of manualism vs. oralism. This is consistent with medicalisation and the standardisation of the 'normal' body in the 19th century, when differences between normal and abnormal began to be debated. It is important to consider the sociocultural context, particularly in regards to the Deaf community, which considers itself to possess its own unique language and culture. This accounts for the cochlear implant being seen as an affront to their culture, as many do not believe that deafness is {{something that needs to be}} cured. However, it has also been argued that this does not necessarily have to be the case: the cochlear implant can act as a tool Deaf people can use to access the 'hearing world' without losing their Deaf identity.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{religion}} is a social construct, since in other eras, religion, culture, and even national identity were often inseparable. And as for spirituality, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> concept with a new usage. Previous to today’s era, what people today call spirituality was often called piety. Professor of Theology, Linda Mercadante sees religion as a complex adaptive network of myths, symbols, rituals and concepts that simultaneously figure patterns of feeling, thinking, and acting and disrupt stable structures of meaning and purpose. When understood in that way, religion not only involves ideas and practices that are manifestly religious but also includes {{a broad range of}} cultural phenomena not ordinarily associated with religion. Many people use spirituality to refer to their interior life of faith and religion to mean the necessary communal and/or organizational part. Mercadante sees both spirituality and religion as consisting of four basic components: beliefs, desire, rituals, and behavioural expectations, but across the field of Religious Studies the definitions vary. When Mercadante has spoken with SBNRs, they take a decidedly anti-dogmatic stance against religious belief in general. They claim not only that belief is non-essential, but that it is potentially harmful or at least a hindrance to spirituality.|$|E

500|$|When {{he retired}} from the NHL, Vanbiesbrouck took over as the head coach and {{director}} of hockey operations for the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. In February 2003, the team had a record of 18-24-4-3. A month later on March 7, the Greyhounds lost 6–1 to the Guelph Storm. After the game Vanbiesbrouck used a racial slur in expressing his anger with Trevor Daley (now with the Detroit Red Wings), a black player and Greyhounds' team captain, to two of Daley's white teammates. Daley was told of the remarks by his teammates and was advised to leave the team by his agent Bobby Orr. Daley returned home to Toronto and informed the commissioner of the OHL about the remarks. The day after Daley left the team, Vanbiesbrouck resigned his positions as coach and general manager, and sold his ownership stake in the team. In his apology Vanbiesbrouck stated [...] "I used the 'N' word instead of calling him Trevor, I used it just not thinking. It's a mistake and consequences have to be paid by me, I've embarrassed everybody and my family by this one comment. It's not what they represent and it's not what the Sault Greyhounds organization represents." [...] He added [...] "I told Trev <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> wound with me, I grew up with it. I'm as sorry as anybody that it's stuck with me." [...] Daley returned to the team three days after leaving, but Vanbiesbrouck never returned to a coaching position.|$|E

2500|$|Running at 392 {{lines in}} its {{unabridged}} version, Luceafărul alternates iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> pattern in Romanian poetry, having been noted {{for instance in}} Dosoftei's preamble to Erofili, and is described by critic Alex. Ștefănescu as [...] "lapidary, enunciative, solemn in its simplicity." [...] The rhythmic sequencing has created a long-standing dilemma about the intended pronunciation of Hyperion: while common Romanian phonology favors Hypérion, the text suggests that Eminescu used Hyperión. Artistic license also surfaces in the apparent pleonasm, with which Cătălina beckons Hyperion: Cobori în jos, luceafăr blând ("Descend down, gentle Morning Star"). Some Eminescu exegetes see here an intellectual stress on the separation between the realms, breached by [...] "divine descent into humanity", or the repetition one associates with incantation.|$|E
