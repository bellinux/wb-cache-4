We used a Spanish translation of the Index for Inclusion, which has been adapted and divided into three Likert-type scales about inclusive cultures, organisation in the teaching–learning context and inclusive practices. We did a t-test to detect any significant differences in teachers’ responses {{in terms of the}} ordinary or specific teaching contexts in which they work. No significant differences were seen in the items related to cultures and organisation, but we found significant differences in 12 of the 36 items of the inclusive practices scale. Finally, we discuss the role of the processes for innovation and transformation in secondary schools and provide key factors to build an intercultural inclusive schoo...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of the so-called «feeble-minded childhood» {{was one of the}} immediate consequences of obligatory education. The fact that some child had difficulties in accepting educational rules or getting adapted to them lead to their medicalization and to set off an assistive technology that, under different titles like medico-pedagogy, <b>therapeutic</b> education, orthophrenic <b>pedagogy,</b> delineated a field of action shared by physicians and pedagogues.
