30|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the advantages and}} limitation of the displacement map technique for generating 3 D maps, consider the following example. An aerial-view photograph is recorded of {{a room full of}} people with a distribution <b>of</b> <b>heights,</b> colored in grey-scale according to <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> each person. It is not a simple task to draw conclusions on <b>the</b> relative <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> different people, especially without reference to the color scale, however, it is of course much easier to obtain knowledge on <b>the</b> relative <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people when viewing from the side. The extra dimension allows the potential for insight into <b>the</b> <b>height</b> distribution to increase. <b>The</b> absolute <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> each individual could also be obtained by directly measuring them, however if this were time consuming <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> a subsection {{of the people in the}} room could be measured, and provided that <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>heights</b> throughout <b>the</b> population were homogeneous and random, data from that subsection could be applied to approximate <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of the group. Thus, <b>the</b> relative <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people are accurately represented, and their absolute heights are approximated in a short time. Provided one keeps in mind the limitations of the technique, this can be a highly effective tool in analyzing large populations of data.|$|R

5|$|The pillars {{that support}} {{the roof of the}} mantapa are {{monolithic}} shafts from the base up to the neck of the capital.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> Brazilian {{people using}} anthropometric and economic data. The {{literature suggests that}} height is a good proxy of the material living conditions of different populations. Data indicate {{that the difference between}} <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> 21 and 65 -year-old men is approximately six centimetres. The same value, by coincidence, represents the difference in the stature of the poorest and richest quintiles. Adjusted data show an increase of 3. 8 centimetres in <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> adult male Brazilians born between 1939 and 1981. There are also stable regional differences; in the North and Northeast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, <b>heights</b> are about two centimetres lower than the national average for all groups. Regression analyses show that proxy variables related to living conditions during bodily growth, and using regional dummies, were statistically significant causes of the variation in <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> individuals. In contrast, colour, urban/rural, and inequality variables were not significant. The results replicate what the historiography of the relation between living conditions and stature makes clear: the social environment has a significant impact on <b>the</b> average <b>height</b> <b>of</b> populations. ...|$|R
