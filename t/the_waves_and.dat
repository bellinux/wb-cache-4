5|$|Little or {{no attempt}} was made to recruit African-American or other women {{minorities}} until October 1944, when President Roosevelt approved of accepting African-American women into the women's reserve, under pressure to do so by African-American organizations. Harriet Ida Pickens and Frances Wills were the first African-American women to become WAVE officers. By September 1945, there were 72 African-American women in <b>the</b> <b>WAVES</b> <b>and</b> integrated.|$|E
5|$|Although the USCG officially {{opened its}} doors to African-American women in October 1944, {{it was not until}} March 1945 that the first five women were {{accepted}}; they were the only African-American women to serve in the SPARS. Although the Women's Army Corps (WAC) accepted African-American women from its inception, the U.S. Navy's Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES) only began accepting African-American women in October 1944, with fewer than 100 of them serving in <b>the</b> <b>WAVES,</b> <b>and</b> the U.S. Marine Corps Women's Reserve never opened its ranks to African-American women. The five African-American women who served in the SPARS were: Olivia Hooker, D. Winifred Byrd, Julia Mosley, Yvonne Cumberbatch, and Aileen Cooke.|$|E
5|$|Droits de l'Homme was irreparably damaged, {{and many}} of the men on board were {{soldiers}} with no training for what to do {{in the event of a}} shipwreck. Each successive wave swept more men into the water and desperate attempts to launch boats failed when the small craft were swept away by <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> <b>and</b> broken in the surf. Rafts were constructed, but several were swamped in attempts to carry a rope to the shore. The men on the one raft that remained upright were forced to cut the rope to prevent them from foundering in the heavy seas. Some of the men on this raft reached the beach, the first survivors of the wreck. Subsequent attempts were made by individuals to swim to shore with ropes, but they were either drowned or driven back to the ship by the force of the sea.|$|E

5|$|September 17, 2003- Hurricane Isabel {{passes to}} the {{southwest}} of the state as it makes landfall on North Carolina. In the days preceding its landfall, Isabel produces strong waves, and upon striking land, the storm causes a 5-foot (1.5m) storm surge along the Delaware coast. <b>The</b> <b>waves</b> <b>and</b> surge result in beach erosion and overwash. The outer rainbands of Isabel drop around 1inch (25mm) of rain, though the storm's large circulation produces strong wind gusts of up to 70mph (112km/h). The wind gusts knock down many trees and power lines, causing {{one of the worst}} power outages for Conectiv Energy. Damage totals to $17.8million (2003USD, $20.9million 2008USD). Due to the damage, President Bush declares the entire state a disaster area.|$|E
5|$|Seven ships {{reported}} {{tropical storm}} force winds {{in association with}} Carlotta, peaking at 46mph (74km/h); the lowest pressure recorded by ship was 1,008mbar. Offshore, waves reached 40feet (12m) in height. The Lithuanian freighter Linkuva, en route to Long Beach, California, encountered <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> <b>and</b> strong winds as the hurricane was undergoing its period of rapid intensification. After an engine failure, the freighter was lost about 220miles (355km) southwest of Acapulco. A naval vessel from both the United States Navy and the Mexican Navy searched for the freighter for three days, though the crew was lost and presumed killed.|$|E
5|$|The Navy {{established}} five separation {{centers for}} the demobilization of <b>the</b> <b>WAVES</b> <b>and</b> Navy nurses, one in Washington, D.C., Memphis, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York. The separation process began on 1 October 1945, {{and within a}} month about 9,000 WAVES had been separated. By the end of 1946, almost 21,000 more had been discharged. It soon became apparent that more centers were needed and ten additional centers were soon opened. By September 1946, demobilization of the WAVES was all but completed. Most women spent {{two or three days}} at separation centers before being discharged, having physical exams; orientation on rights as veterans; final settlement of pay, and then the price of a ticket home. At the time, it was not clear whether demobilization meant phasing women out of the military services altogether.|$|E

5|$|Thomas enjoyed Fabian's {{performance}} in the episode, arguing {{that it was an}} example of the actor's scene stealer quality that led Thomas to initially cast him after his appearance in an episode of his earlier series Cupid. The scene in which Keith boards the ship on which Hank is located was difficult to film because there were limited daylight filming hours. The crew thought it was important for the audience to see <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> <b>and</b> the ocean. However, they were unable to finish filming the scene within the course of one day, so the crew made a quick decision to place a makeshift blue screen as part of the background for the interior of the boat. It was intended that the blue screen be edited in post-production in order to represent the ocean, but upon learning that this change would cost millions of dollars, the crew decided to forgo the alteration and instead pass off the blue screen as a tarpaulin.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some species}} of sea anemone burrow in soft sediment, the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend {{to stay in the}} same spot for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the front edge, which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> <b>and</b> currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of rough seas and winds uprooted {{long stretches of}} trees and wrecked numerous ships. The entire town of Savanna-la-Mar was nearly destroyed by the hurricane's effects, which included damage to several local churches. The storm also virtually destroyed the communities of Green Island, Lucea, and Negril, where a church remained the only standing structure. In Montego Bay, at least 300people were left homeless, many of whom temporarily lived in the courthouse after losing their homes. A total of 42people {{were killed in the}} city. Several other wharves along the coast were swept away due to <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> <b>and</b> wind. Across western Jamaica, roughly a hundred homes were destroyed, while 5,000buildings were damaged or demolished. Due to the destruction caused by the tropical cyclone, Jamaica governor Sydney Olivier, 1st Baron Olivier assessed damage in the western portion of the island. The government of Jamaica ordered the dispatch of artillerymen in order to bring 300tents and other relief supplies to impacted regions. Additionally, money was raised to aid those who became homeless.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Graham, the Master of the Mint, in 1859 persuaded William Gladstone, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, {{that the}} state of the copper {{currency}} demanded a lighter, more durable replacement. Bronze was selected as harder and less subject to oxidation. It was a material with which the Mint had experience, having recently struck bronze coins for the Canadian colonies, and it had been used in France since 1852. Parliament passed legislation in 1860 that allowed the penny to be struck from an alloy of metals. The act required that Britannia appear on the coin, as the design was felt to symbolise Britain as ruler of <b>the</b> <b>waves,</b> <b>and</b> to omit her would be seen as abandoning that role. The Mint in 1860 awarded a contract for 1,720 tonnes of bronze pennies, halfpennies and farthings to James Watt & Co of Birmingham, a contract that would not be completed until 1863. Heaton's was also called upon to supply dies and coins, especially as Watt's prepared to execute its huge contract.|$|E
