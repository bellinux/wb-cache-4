40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{methodology}} of the dynamic optimum design of the one translational and three rotational degrees of freedom parallel robots while considering the rigid-body dynamic property. The dynamic optimum design of the 3 UPS-PRU (underlined P denotes an active prismatic joint driven by a servomotor) parallel robot is presented while considering the constraints on the installation dimension, joint rotation angle, and the interference. <b>The</b> maximum <b>driving</b> torque and <b>the</b> maximum <b>driving</b> power of <b>the</b> actuating joints are taken as the objective functions in the dynamic optimum design, respectively. The physical meanings of the objective functions are <b>the</b> maximum <b>driving</b> torque and <b>the</b> maximum <b>driving</b> power of <b>the</b> actuating joints when the moving platform translates along the z-axis in the maximum linear acceleration amax, rotates about an arbitrary axis in the maximum angular acceleration αmax, translates along the z-axis in the maximum linear velocity vmax, and rotates about an arbitrary axis in the maximum angular velocity ωmax at the same time. The object of the dynamic optimum design is to minimize <b>the</b> maximum <b>driving</b> torque or <b>the</b> maximum <b>driving</b> power by employing worst case criterion. In the predefined design task, {{the results of the}} dynamic optimum design of the 3 UPS-PRU parallel robot are the same when taking <b>the</b> maximum <b>driving</b> torque and <b>the</b> maximum <b>driving</b> power as <b>the</b> objective functions. The phenomenon can be verified {{by the fact that the}} distributions of <b>the</b> maximum <b>driving</b> torque and <b>the</b> maximum <b>driving</b> power are very similar to each other. The robot dimension has also been taken into account in the dynamic optimum design of the 3 UPS-PRU parallel robot due to the consideration of the building cost and the miniaturization. The example of the dynamic optimum design of the 3 UPS-PRU parallel robot is presented in the simulation. The conclusions are provided at the end of the article...|$|R
