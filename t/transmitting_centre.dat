40|$|An {{acoustic}} neural telemetry tag {{has been}} developed for recording from free-swimming aquatic animals. Microwire electrodes were implanted into the VIIIth nerve of the toadfish, Opsanus tau, and interfaced to the subdermally implanted tag. The telemetry tag frequency modulates the neural signal, converting it into a varying frequency, which is amplified and <b>transmitted</b> acoustically (<b>centre</b> frequency of 90 kHz and a 20 kHz bandwidth). This acoustic signal is detected by a receiver hydrophone, and the receiver reconstructs the full neural waveform from the acoustic signal. However, due to the multipath environment in the experimental aquarium, the acoustic signal is quickly degraded as the hydrophone is {{moved away from the}} source. In order to receive the signal independent of fish position, an anechoic aquarium was designed. Streams of microbubbles (ca. 70 microm diameter) were generated to produce a curtain of sound-absorptive material along the walls and water surface of the aquarium. Microbubble generation significantly reduced the multipath artefacts, and allowed signal discrimination independent of fish and hydrophone position. The anechoic aquarium will allow the recording of neural activity from free-swimming fishes in quasi-natural habitats, thus allowing better understanding of the neural mechanisms of behaviour...|$|R

50|$|The Stalwart's {{impressive}} over-terrain capabilities {{came from}} the fact that the 6-wheel-drive system lacked differentials, using simple bevel gears to <b>transmit</b> drive. A <b>centre</b> mounted no-spin differential allowed a certain amount of slip between the two sets of wheels on each side of the vehicle on hard surfaces, but there was no allowance for rotational speed differences between front and rear. The centre no-spin unit allowed the wheels on either side of the vehicle with most grip to drive when off-road. This had the effect of making the vehicle appear to crab (move from side to side) when negotiating muddy conditions, thus making the Stalwart a true 6-wheel-drive vehicle, with 3 wheels locked together and turning at the same speed.|$|R

The decision {{to build a new}} <b>transmitting</b> <b>centre</b> near the village of Sitkunai, about 17 km north of Kaunas was made by the Government of Lithuania in 1937. The building works started in 1939, and after completion, a 120 kW medium wave transmitter from Standard Telephones and Cables in the United Kingdom was ordered. However, the outbreak of World War II stopped the shipment. The empty transmitter buildings in Sitkunai survived the war with almost no damage and were used as military compound by the German army in 1941-1944, and later as a primary school. Because the Soviet Lithuania was badly covered by radio signals, the Soviet authorities decided to continue the building work at Sitkunai and turn the site into a main shortwave and medium wave <b>transmitting</b> <b>centre.</b> During 1951 and 1952 two 50 kW shortwave transmitters, dismantled from an East German utility site as war reparations were installed in Sitkūnai. Several curtain antennas were erected and one 150 kW mediumwave transmitter was installed (665 kHz). During the January Events in 1991, Sitkūnai Radio Station was among those transmitting sites broadcasting to the world about the Soviet military actions in Vilnius when 14 civilians were killed and more than 600 injured.|$|E

All consecutive outpatients with demonstrated CBP attending a single Sexually <b>Transmitted</b> Disease <b>centre</b> from January 1997 and December 2008, were enrolled and underwent microbiological cultures in first void early morning urine, midstream urine, expressed prostatic secretion, and post prostate massage urine. Prevalence of different bacterial strains was stratified in four different periods: 1997 - 1999, 2000 - 2002, 2003 - 2005, 2006 - 2008. Any changes observed in epidemiological features and resistance rates in uropathogens over the whole study period have been analyzed. The present study has been planned, thus, as in vitro study. From 6, 221 patients, 4, 601 Gram-positive and 1, 620 Gram-negative bacterial strains have been isolated. Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli strains are the first and second frequent pathogens found, respectively.

40|$|A {{modern and}} civilized society {{is so much}} {{dependent}} {{on the use of}} electrical energy because it has been the most powerful vehicle for facilitating economic, industrial, and social developments. Electrical energy produced at power stations is <b>transmitted</b> to load <b>centres</b> from where it is distributed to its consumers through the use of transmission lines run from one place to another. As a result of the physical properties of the transmission medium, some of the transmitted power is lost to the surroundings. The overall effect of power losses on the system is a reduction in the quantity of power available to the consumers. An accurate knowledge of transmission losses is hinged on the ability to correctly predict the available current and voltage along transmission lines. Therefore, mathematical physics expressions depicting the evolution of current and voltage on a typical transmission line were formulated, and derived therefrom were models to predict available current and voltage, respectively, at any point on the transmission line. The predictive models evolved as explicit expressions of the space variable and they are in close agreement with empirical data and reality...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) genital {{infection}} {{has been}} related to several diseases in young sexually active women. It {{could be related to}} their sexual quality of life. AIM: To assess whether genital Ct infection can induce sexual function alterations in women. METHODS: Nine hundred ninety-eight women (mean age 29. 4, range 18 - 43) attending our Sexually <b>Transmitted</b> Disease <b>Centre</b> were enrolled in this observational case-control study. All participants were clinically and microbiologically investigated due to their sexual relationships with a subject affected by chronic bacterial prostatitis. All participants underwent microbiological cultures, DNA and antibodies evaluation for common bacteria and Ct on vaginal swab and urine samples. They completed the Female Sexual Function Index [FSFI] questionnaire. On the basis of microbiological investigation results, all patients were split into three groups: Group A-genital Ct infection, Group B-genital common bacteria/yeast infection, and Group C-negative for Ct and bacteria/yeast infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: FSFI questionnaire. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-one women were classified in Group A, 276 in Group B, and 431 in Group C. Group A patients were statistically, significantly different from Group B and Group C patients in terms of pain during sexual intercourse and sexual satisfaction. Group C patients had significantly higher FSFI scores (27. 1 ± 1. 3) (P < 0. 001) for both desire (4. 9 ± 1. 0) and lubrication domain (3. 8 ± 1. 1) (P < 0. 001, P < 0. 003, respectively) when compared with Group A patients. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that negative Ct infection marker in female patients must be considered as an independent prognostic factor in predicting a subsequent optimal FSFI questionnaire score (P = 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS: Positive values of Ct infection markers are associated with lower FSFI scores for sexual desire, lubrication, and overall sexual function. Genital Ct infection could induce pain during sexual intercourse, reducing sexual satisfaction and sexual quality of life in young sexually active women...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: During {{the last}} decade, {{operational}} oceanography {{had to face}} the challenge of building integrated observational systems capable of real-time recording and transmitting parameters not only from the atmosphere and the upper sea, but also from the deep sea layers. The Hellenic Centre for Marine Research in the frame work of the Poseidon II project, managed to deploy a Seabed observatory in the Southern part of Ionian Sea, a few miles outside Pylos bay at 1674 m depth. The real-time measurements are <b>transmitted</b> to operational <b>centre</b> through the existing «Poseidon » telecommunication network. The communication between the platform and the surface buoy is achieved through hydro-acoustic modems. An inductive modem is also used for the functioning of a Passive Aquatic Listener (PAL) which is attached on the buoy’s mooring line. The PAL has an embedded algorithm which allows the noise classification in order to provide timeseries of precipitation, waves, whale’s signals etc. The tsunami detection module consists of a high resolution pressure sensor which records changes in water column pressure in high frequency time steps. The bottom observatory is also equipped with a CTD instrument for temperature and salinity records of the deep water environment. Furthermore, additional sensors can also be hosted to the seabed platform covering possible future needs...|$|R
40|$|National {{surveillance}} data from 2006 to 2010 of the Dutch sexually <b>transmitted</b> infection (STI) <b>centres</b> {{were used to}} analyse current practices on testing extragenital sites for chlamydia and gonorrhoea in {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) and women. In MSM, 76. 0 % and 88. 9 % were tested at least at one extragenital site (pharyngeal and/or anorectal) for chlamydia and gonorrhoea, respectively; for women this was 20. 5 % and 30. 2 %. Testing more than one anatomic site differed by STI centre, ranging from 2 % to 100 %. In MSM tested at multiple sites, 63. 0 % and 66. 5 % of chlamydia and gonorrhoea diagnoses, respectively, would have been missed if screened at the urogenital site only, mainly anorectal infections. For women tested at multiple sites, the proportions of missed chlamydia and gonorrhoea diagnoses would have been 12. 9 % and 30. 0 %, respectively. Testing extragenital sites appears warranted, due to the numerous infections that would have been missed. Adding anorectal screening to urogenital screening for all MSM visiting an STI centre should be recommended. Since actual testing practices differ by centre, there is a need for clearer guidelines. Routine gonorrhoea and chlamydia screening at multiple sites in STI centres should be investigated further as this might be a more effective approach to reduce transmission than current practic...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that primary afferent C-fibres that respond to innocuous tactile stimuli are important in the sensation of pleasurable touch. Although it is known that C-tactile fibres terminate in the substantia gelatinosa (lamina II) of the spinal cord, virtually all of the neurons in this region are interneurons, and currently it is not known how impulses in C-mechanoreceptors are <b>transmitted</b> to higher <b>centres.</b> In the current study, I have tested the quantitative response properties of ‘wide dynamic range’ projection neurons in lamina I of the spinal cord to graded velocity brushing stimuli to identify whether low-threshold mechanoreceptor input to these neurons arises from myelinated or umyelinated nerve fibres. Graded velocity brushing stimuli (6. 6 – 126 cm s− 1) were used to characterize the mechanoreceptor inputs to ‘wide dynamic range’ neurons in lamina I of the dorsal horn that had axons that projected to the contralateral parabrachial nucleus. The most effective tactile stimuli for activation of ‘wide dynamic range’ lamina I spinoparabrachial neurons were low velocity brush strokes: peak discharge occurred at a mean velocity of 9. 2 cm s− 1 (range 6. 6 – 20. 4 cm s− 1, s. d. 5. 0 cm s− 1), and declined exponentially as brush velocity increased.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Samples were taken from the urethra in men and from the cervix and urethra in women by universal swab (Biolab(R)) into Urea-Myco DUO kit (Bio-Rad(R)) and were incubated for 48 hours at 37 C degrees. Antibiotic sensitivity of positive samples was determined in U 9 bouillon using SIR Mycoplasma kit (Bio-Rad(R)). RESULTS: Samples for 4154 patients aged 16 - 60 years were examined. In 247 / 4154 samples (6 %) U. urealyticum and in 26 / 4154 samples (0. 63 %) M. hominis was isolated from the genital tract. Most U. urealyticum and M. hominis strains (75 % and 77 %, respectively) were cultured from cervix, while the remaining 25 %, and 23 % from the male and female urethra, respectively. U. urealyticum and M. hominis were most commonly detected in patients aged between 21 and 40 years. The majority of U. urealyticum strains were sensitive to tetracycline (94 %), doxycycline (95 %), azithromycin (88 %) and josamycin (90 %), but were resistant to ofloxacin (21 %), erythromycin (85 %) and clindamycin (79 %). Seventy-seven percent of the U. urealyticum strains were simultaneously resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, suggesting that ex iuvantibus therapies may select cross-resistant strains to both antibiotics. The resistance of M. hominis to clindamycin, doxycycline, ofloxacin and tetracycline varied between 4 % and 12 %. CONCLUSIONS: Because none of the strains was sensitive to all examined antibiotics, the antibiotic sensitivity of U. urealyticum and M. hominis strains should be determined. The high rate of ofloxacin, erythromycin and clindamycin resistance should be considered in the therapy of U. urealyticum infections in Hungary. This is the first such a clinical microbiological study in this topic in Hungary...|$|R
60|$|Whilst {{examining}} these leaves, I {{was struck}} {{with the fact}} that in six, perhaps seven, of them the tentacles were much more inflected at the distal and proximal ends of the leaf (i.e. towards the apex and base) than on either side; and yet the tentacles on the sides stood as near to the gland where the bit of meat lay as did those at the two ends. It thus appeared as [page 237] if the motor impulse was <b>transmitted</b> from the <b>centre</b> across the disc more readily in a longitudinal than in a transverse direction; and as this appeared a new and interesting fact in the physiology of plants, thirty-five fresh experiments were made to test its truth. Minute bits of meat were placed on a single gland or on a few glands, on the right or left side of the discs of eighteen leaves; other bits of the same size being placed on the distal or proximal ends of seventeen other leaves. Now if the motor impulse were transmitted with equal force or at an equal rate through the blade in all directions, a bit of meat placed at one side or {{at one end of the}} disc ought to affect equally all the tentacles situated at an equal distance from it; but this certainly is not the case. Before giving the general results, it may be well to describe three or four rather unusual cases.|$|R
40|$|Standard phase-domain pulsed Doppler {{techniques}} used in Colour Flow Mapping such as spectral Doppler or autocor relation are monochromatic, {{focused on the}} analysis of the <b>centre</b> <b>transmit</b> frequency. As such all the algorithms using those approaches are limited: in terms of spatial Doppler resolution because of the long pulses typically used for transmission, in terms of frame rate because of the necessity to perform many Doppler lines repetitions and additional B-mode imaging transmissions, and in terms of accuracy which depends on the stability of the Doppler signal at the frequency considered. A velocimetry technique is presented which estimates the shifts between successive Doppler line segments using the phase information provided by the Fourier transform. Such an approach allows extraction of more information from the backscattered signal through the averaging of results from multiple frequencies inside the bandwidth, as well as the transmission of wide band - high resolution - pulses. The technique is tested on Doppler signals acquired with a research scanner in a straight latex pipe perfused with water and cellulose scatterers, and on an ultrasound contrast agent solution. The results are compared with the velocity estimates provided by standard spectral Doppler and autocorrelation methods. Results show that the proposed technique performs better than both other approaches, especially when few Doppler lines are processed. The technique is also shown to be compatible with contrast Doppler imaging. The proposed approach enables high frame rate, high resolution Doppler. </p...|$|R

Improvement in neonatal and paediatric cardiac surgery has increased the incidence of congenital {{heart disease in}} pregnancy worldwide. Published data regarding heart disease in pregnancy (HDP) in KSA are scant and relatively old. This study examines the current status of HDP in KSA and describes the rationale and design of the suggested plan for HDP in KSA, i. e., the Registry Of Saudi Heart Disease And Pregnancy (ROSHDAP). MethodsA systematic search was conducted through the ProQuest MEDLINE® database using the keyword phrase “cardiovascular disease in pregnancy”. An extensive literature review about heart disease in pregnancywas performed. ResultsThere are only 4 available Saudi studies of HDP. The ROSHDAP study is expected to establish a foundation for Saudi research in this field and will create an extensive database that will enrich knowledge about HDP. All Saudi women with HDP who wish to participate are eligible for enrolment in the registry.

All subjects (n = 1009) underwent a urologic visit and microbiological tests on first void, midstream urine and total ejaculate samples. One hundred and five patients were positive for HPV DNA (10. 4  %; mean age: 34. 8 ± 5. 8 years) and consented to clinical examination and molecular diagnostic assays for HPV detection scheduled every 6 months (median surveillance period of 53. 2  months). HPV genotypes were classified as high risk, probable high risk and low risk. HPV-positive samples which did not hybridise {{with any of the}} type-specific probes were referred to as positive non-genotypeable. At enrollment, the distribution of HPV genotypes was as follows: high-risk HPV (n = 37), probable high-risk HPV (n = 6), low-risk HPV (n = 23) and non-genotypeable HPV (n = 39). A high HPV genotype concordance between stable sexual partners emerged (kappa = 0. 92; p < 0. 001).

GIOVE-B is orbiting at an altitude of 23 173 kilometres, making a complete journey around the Earth in 14 hours and 3 minutes. The quality of the signals transmitted by GIOVE-B will have an important influence on the accuracy of the positioning information that will be provided by the user receivers on the ground. On board, GIOVE-B carries a passive hydrogen maser atomic clock, which is expected to deliver unprecedented stability performance. The signal quality can be affected by the environment of the satellite in its orbit and by the propagation path of the signals travelling from space to ground. Additionally, the satellite signals must not create interference with services operating in adjacent frequency bands, and this is also being checked. Galileo teams within ESA and industry have the means to observe and record the spectrum of the signals transmitted by GIOVE-B in real time. Several measurements are performed relating to <b>transmitted</b> signal power, <b>centre</b> frequency and bandwidth, as well as the format of the navigation signals generated on board. This allows the analysis of the satellite transmissions in the three frequency bands reserved for it. The GIOVE-B mission also represents an opportunity for validating in-orbit critical satellite technologies, characterising the Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) radiation environment, and to test a key element of the future Galileo system - the user receivers.|$|R
