40|$|A {{history of}} the {{evolution}} and the design development of Extended Reach Sluicer System (ERSS) is presented. Several challenges are described {{that had to be}} overcome to create a machine that went beyond the capabilities of prior generation sluicers to mobilize waste in Single Shell Tanks for pumping into Double Shell <b>Tank</b> <b>receiver</b> tanks. Off-the-shelf technology and traditional hydraulic fluid power systems were combined with the custom-engineered components to create the additional functionality of the ERSS, while still enabling it to fit within very tight entry envelope into the SST. Problems and challenges inevitably were encountered and overcome in ways that enhance {{the state of the art}} of fluid power applications in such constrained environments. Future enhancements to the ERSS design are explored for retrieval of tanks with different dimensions and internal obstacles...|$|E
40|$|A vortex motion phase {{separator}} is disclosed for transferring {{a liquid}} in a zero gravity environment {{while at the}} same time separating the liquid from vapors found within either the sender or the receiving tanks. The separator comprises a rigid sender tank having a circular cross-section and rigid <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> having a circular cross-section. A plurality of ducts connects the sender <b>tank</b> and the <b>receiver</b> <b>tank.</b> Disposed within the ducts connecting the <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> and the sender tank is a pump and a plurality of valves. The pump is powered by an electric motor and is adapted to draw either the liquid or a mixture of the liquid and the vapor from the sender tank. Initially, the mixture drawn from the sender tank is directed through a portion of the ductwork and back into the sender tank at a tangent to the inside surface of the sender tank, thereby creating a swirling vortex of the mixture within the sender tank. As the pumping action increases, the speed of the swirling action within the sender tank increases creating an increase in the centrifugal force operating on the mixture. The effect of the centrifugal force is to cause the heavier liquid to migrate to the inside surface of the sender tank and to separate from the vapor. When this separation reaches a predetermined degree, control means is activated to direct the liquid conveyed by the pump directly into the <b>receiver</b> <b>tank.</b> At the same time, the vapor within the <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> is directed from the <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> back into the sender tank. This flow continues until substantially all of the liquid is transferred from the sender <b>tank</b> to the <b>receiver</b> <b>tank...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 38 {{hydrogen}} no-vent fill tests were performed {{in this test}} series using various size spray nozzles and a spray bar with different hole sizes in a 5 cubic foot <b>receiver</b> <b>tank.</b> Fill levels of 90 percent by volume or greater were achieved in 26 of the tests while maintaining a <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> pressure below 30 psia. Spray nozzles were mounted {{at the top of}} the tank, whereas, the spray bar was centered in the tank axially. The spray nozzle no-vent fills demonstrated tank pressure and temperature responses comparable to previous test series. <b>Receiver</b> <b>tank</b> pressure responses for the spray bar configuration were similar to the spray nozzle tests with the pressure initially rising rapidly, then leveling off as vapor condenses onto the discharging liquid streams, and finally ramping up near the end of the test due to ullage compression. Both liquid injection techniques tested were capable of filling the <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> to 90 percent under variable test conditions.

50|$|Over {{the last}} decade or so air {{suspension}} has become popular in the custom automobile culture: street rods, trucks, cars, and even motorcycles may have air springs. They are used in these applications to provide an adjustable suspension which allows vehicles to sit extremely low, yet be able rise to a level high enough to manoeuver over obstacles and inconsistencies on paved surfaces. These systems generally employ small, electric or engine-driven air compressors which sometimes fill an on-board air <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> which stores compressed air for use in the future without delay.

40|$|Architectures for {{extended}} duration missions often include an on-orbit replenishment {{of the space}} vehicle's cryogenic liquid propellants. Such a replenishment could be accomplished via a tank-to-tank transfer from a dedicated tanker or a more permanent propellant depot storage tank. Minimizing the propellant loss associated with transfer line and <b>receiver</b> propellant <b>tank</b> thermal conditioning is essential for mass savings. A new methodology for conducting tank-to-tank transfer while minimizing such losses has been demonstrated. Charge-Hold-Vent is the traditional methodology for conducting a tank-to-tank propellant transfer. A small amount of cryogenic liquid is introduced to chill the transfer line and propellant tank. As the propellant absorbs heat and undergoes a phase change, the tank internal pressure increases. The tank is then vented to relieve pressure prior to another charge of cryogenic liquid being introduced. This cycle is repeated until the transfer lines and tank are sufficiently chilled and the replenishment of the propellant tank is complete. This method suffers inefficiencies due to multiple chill and vent cycles within the transfer lines and associated feed system components. Additionally, this system requires precise measuring of cryogenic fluid delivery for each transfer, multiple valve cycling events, and other complexities associated with cycled operations. To minimize propellant loss and greatly simplify on-orbit operations, an alternate methodology has been designed and demonstrated. The Vented Chill / No Vent Fill method is a simpler, constant flow approach in which the propellant tank and transfer lines are only chilled once. The <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> is continuously vented as cryogenic liquid chills the transfer lines, tank mass and ullage space. Once chilled sufficiently, the <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> valve is closed and the tank is completely filled. Interestingly, the vent valve can be closed prior to <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> components reaching liquid saturation temperature. An incomplete fill results if insufficient energy {{is removed from the}} tank's thermal mass and ullage space. The key to successfully conducting the no vent fill is to assure that sufficient energy is removed from the system prior to closing the <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> vent valve. This paper will provide a description of the transfer methodology and test article, and will provide a discussion of test results...|$|R

50|$|The {{in-depth}} research through theoretical approaches, wargaming {{and exercises}} developed a confidence within the Panzertruppe itself (and political support by Hitler) in the armoured formation {{as the key}} battlefield formation â although this view was before 1940 not shared by the other Arms of Service.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is twofold. First, this report {{documents}} the technical evaluation supporting the Project Hanford Management Contract (PHMC) contractor recommendation to close the Unreviewed Safety Question (USQ) as originally evaluated in TF- 94 - 0260, Soil Compaction Test Data Indicates Soil Density in Excess of Density Used in Tank Qualification Analysis for AP Tank Farm. Second, this report describes the status of existing structural analyses for the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) waste storage structures and outlines the associated technical upgrades being considered by the contractor. This second feature of the report serves to communicate {{the distinction between the}} soil density issue which is the topic of the open USQ and other technical issues which are important to the contractor from a programmatic standpoint. Contractor actions to address the latter technical issues would support improvements in day-to-day operations (e. g., provide possible relaxations in soil load restrictions) but are not necessary to close the soil density USQ. Section 2. 0 of this report documents the rationale for the PHMC contractor recommendation to the Department of Energy (DOE) to close the soil density USQ. Section 3. 0 documents the recommended structural analyses improvements for the double-shell tanks (DSTs) which are the structures associated with the soil density USQ. Sections 4. 0 and 5. 0 provide, for completeness, the same information for single-shell <b>tanks</b> (SSTs), double-contained <b>receiver</b> <b>tanks</b> (DCRTs), catch tanks and inactive miscellaneous underground storage tanks (IMUSTs).
