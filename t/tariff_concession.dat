40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} history of {{bilateral}} trade negotiations between Taiwan and the U. S. The question posed at the outset is: does bilateralism enhance or jeopardize multilateralism? The U. S. -Taiwan experience seems to suggest a grossly negative answer. Bilateral negotiations for market opening {{with the threat of}} unilateral trade sanctions (such as Section 301 action) tend to encourage trade preferences and U. S. negotiators are inclined to accept such preferential arrangements in areas where U. S. domestic interests are homogeneous and concentrated. Even in the case of tariff negotiations where any <b>tariff</b> <b>concessions</b> made by Taiwan are extended to other trading partners on an MFN basis, bilateralism does not necessarily enhance multilateral principles. The scope of <b>tariff</b> <b>concessions</b> made by Taiwan shows a strong bias in favor of the sectors in which the U. S. has a comparative advantage in Taiwan's market and the sectors in which U. S. domestic industries exhibit monopoly power. Meanwhile, U. S. commitments to GATT strengthen its position in bilateral negotiations and help persuade Taiwan, which is not a member of GATT, to make similar concessions. ...|$|R
40|$|This audit {{assessed}} the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service 2 ̆ 7 s {{administration of the}} <b>Tariff</b> <b>Concession</b> System. Audit objective and criteria The objective of the audit {{was to assess the}} Australian Customs and Border Protection Service 2 ̆ 7 s administration of the <b>Tariff</b> <b>Concession</b> System. To form a conclusion against the objective, the audit adopted the following high-level criteria: 	an appropriate governance framework to support the effective operation of the system was established; 	a consistent, accountable and transparent assessment process for TCO applications has been implemented; 	processes and systems for the ongoing management, review and eventual revocation of TCOs are effective; and 	the approach to managing compliance with TCO requirements was sound. Overall conclusion Imposing duty on certain imported goods is designed to influence the flow of trade by regulating their value to protect Australia’s local economy and industry. In 2013 – 14, goods to the value of 338  billion were imported into Australia, with 9. 3  billion in customs duty collected. There are, however, a number of ways that importers can obtain duty-free entry of imported goods to Australia, including through accessing duty concession schemes, such as the <b>Tariff</b> <b>Concession</b> System (TCS). To receive a duty concession under the TCS, an imported good must be covered by a current <b>Tariff</b> <b>Concession</b> Order (TCO) made by Customs. A TCO consists of a tariff classification and text describing the good. As at October 2014, there were over 15   000 current TCOs available for use by importers. Under the TCS, around 1. 8  billion in revenue to the Commonwealth was forgone in 2013 – 14. Customs is responsible for administering the TCS, including assessing TCO applications, objections and revocations. In 2013 – 14, Customs received 941 applications for, and 133 objections to, TCO applications, made 770 TCOs, refused 79 TCOs and revoked 327 TCOs. Customs is also responsible for managing compliance with TCS requirements and providing assurance that importers applying a TCO to reduce customs duty are eligible to do so. The TCS is supported by mature administrative arrangements that provide a generally sound basis for the assessment and management of TCOs, including the processing of TCO applications, objections, revocations, as well as the management of TCOs that are in use. There are, however, aspects of Customs’ administrative arrangements that could be further improved, including by: 	developing a communications strategy for the TCS to maximise the effectiveness of communications and awareness raising activities, with a particular focus on local manufacturer engagement; and 	more clearly documenting TCO application assessment activities, in particular the basis on which applications are assessed as meeting legislative requirements, to provide greater assurance regarding the integrity of the assessment and decision-making process. Within the context of Customs’ broader compliance responsibilities, the limited resources assigned to TCS compliance are allocated on a risk basis and, overall, the small number of targeted compliance activities undertaken has identified TCO misuse. Nevertheless, Customs is not well placed to determine whether its activities directed at managing TCS compliance, including education and awareness activities through to enforcement action, are effectively addressing the risks arising from TCO misuse. This is primarily due to the: manner in which Customs collects and stores its compliance data, which makes it difficult to verify the number, scope and outcome of compliance activities; and absence of an appropriate set of performance measures against which an assessment of the effectiveness of compliance activities can be undertaken. To further improve Customs’ administration of the TCS and strengthen compliance monitoring arrangements, the ANAO has made three recommendations designed to: enhance engagement with key stakeholders; provide greater assurance regarding the assessment and decision-making process; and improve the monitoring and reporting of compliance activities...|$|E

40|$|While {{there are}} many studies {{focusing}} on the impacts of various trade policy agreements across {{the world in the}} recent years, there is not much focus in the literature {{on the extent to which}} these agreements are implemented later, in terms of the aspects agreed upon therein. In this paper, we firstly identify the past achievements of the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) in East Asian regions in terms of tariff removals and suggest future rooms for further economic benefits from trade liberalization in the region. Secondly, we provide the <b>tariff</b> <b>concession</b> dataset in the GTAP Data Base, which distinguishes the tariff removals agreed in these EPAs in East Asia but not implemented yet, from the existing overall tariffs in the benchmark year. As the standard GTAP Data Base only incorporates enforced tariff reductions through the base year applied tariffs, to analyse future trade integration, it might be worth it to integer commitments that are not yet implemented. We do that at the HS 6 levels for East Asian EPAs that allows us to compare the economic impacts of partial versus complete implementation of the trade liberalization agreed in East Asian EPAs. Our results suggest that taking those commitments into account economically matters and that such satellite dataset might be taken as actual baseline for future policy simulations.

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the {{estimation}} of trade creation and trade diversion resulting from a trade agreement, {{as a means of}} determining the net gains from bilateral trading agreements. In particular this study {{looks at the}} actual and potential influence of the New Zealand Australia Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on New Zealand imports in terms of trade creation and trade diversion effects. A separate study was made and a set of estimates derived for ten different import commodity groups. A partial equilibrium approach was used which involved deriving a New Zealand excess demand function for each of ten broad import commodity groups. From this trade creation and trade diversion resulting from tariff induced price changes was calculated. Estimates of trade creation and trade diversion were found for: tariff changes over the 1950 - 1972 period and the 1966 - 1972 period, for a 25 percent cut in the 1950 - 1972 average tariff, and a complete movement to free trade with Australia. A movement to free trade was found to be necessary before values for trade creation became significant. However trade diversion was found to remain negligible even on a move to free trade. Welfare gains in general outweighed the welfare losses. This was particularly apparent for those commodity groups of most importance in New Zealand's import trade with Australia. It would seem New Zealand has nothing to lose from granting an across the board <b>tariff</b> <b>concession</b> to Australia and may expect the benefits of reciprocal action by Australia towards New Zealand's exports...|$|E
40|$|Lerøy Seafood Group ASA (LSG) {{is based}} in Bergen {{and is one of}} Norway’s largest {{exporters}} of fish. LSG operates companies worldwide, {{both inside and outside the}} EU. The company has been growing strongly over the last three decades, with revenues up from approximately 100 million NOK (Norwegian kroner) in 1980 to 6057 million NOK in 2008. Sales to the EU area represented 58. 2 percent of total sales in 2008. Salmon is LSG’s most important product and represents approximately 70 percent of the company’s total revenues. Norway is member of the EEA agreement, which brings together the 27 EU members and the EFTA countries (excluding Switzerland) in the “Internal Market. ” However, the EEA Agreement does not cover the EU’s Common Fisheries and Agriculture Policies, which implies that the trade of fish does not move freely. A Norwegian EU membership would imply a full entry into the “Internal Market” and a complete removal of all tariffs. The first part of our analysis examines whether tariffs on Norwegian fish exports are an important trade barrier. The empirical analysis aims at discovering whether the products that received a <b>tariff</b> <b>concession</b> in 1993 have increased their EU share of total Norwegian fish exports. Our findings illustrate no significant correlation. There are clear limitations to our study, but this finding indicates that EU membership is likely to have a minor effect with respect to a removal of tariffs. Other research both supports and opposes our findings, a fact that undeniably illustrates the complexity of this issue. In our discussion, we find that a change in FTA agreements due to a Norwegian EU membership seems to be of limited importance. Antidumping countermeasures and minimal prices forced by the EU have primarily harmed EU consumers. The industry might have gained an economic rent because of a price markup, but on the other hand, the industry could also have experienced increased economic risk and prevented a full utilization of its competitiveness. Interviews with shareholders indicate few trade limitations, but do indicate unnecessary transaction costs due to minimal prices. Furthermore, the compensation quotas Norway received when former EFTA countries joined EU will to very little extent reduce the potential gains from tariff removals. EU membership will result in reduced protectionism of the agricultural industry and thus cheaper food in Norway. This implies that in the home 3 market, LSG could face increased competition from cheaper agricultural products, but one the other hand, LSG could benefit from an increase in consumers’ real purchasing power. If EU membership will change the export structure for Norwegian fish exporters, an important question is whether LSG will be able to defend or increase its export share. Market dynamics suggest more benefits than drawbacks for a large and experienced fish company like LSG. Marketing activities provide little information on how LSG will be affected by EU membership, but product differentiation may increase. Poland entered the EU in 2004 and went from being a third country with a bilateral trade agreement with the EFTA to being a part of the EU tariff union. Poland hence became a strategic place to process fish, and it is currently the most important processing country for Norwegian salmon. Ever since Poland’s accession, there has been a steady increase in Norwegian fish exports in terms of both quantity and value. Our thesis does not indicate clear benefits of a Norwegian EU membership for LSG. The explanation behind this conclusion is that trade barriers are currently limited, Norway is dominant player in the EU salmon market, and through the EEA agreement, Norwegian fish exporters are already benefitting from free movements on inputs without membership. Turning to the opposite question, whether EU membership will be an overall drawback for LSG, we find few negative aspects...|$|E
