5000|$|When Nucor—now one of {{the largest}} steel {{producers}} in the U.S.—decided to enter the <b>long</b> <b>products</b> market in 1969, they chose to start up a mini-mill, with an EAF as its steelmaking furnace, soon followed by other manufacturers. Whilst Nucor expanded rapidly in the Eastern US, the companies that followed them into mini-mill operations concentrated on local markets for <b>long</b> <b>products,</b> where the use of an EAF allowed the plants to vary production according to local demand. This pattern was also followed globally, with EAF steel production primarily used for <b>long</b> <b>products,</b> while integrated mills, using blast furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces, cornered the markets for [...] "flat products"—sheet steel and heavier steel plate. In 1987, Nucor made the decision to expand into the flat products market, still using the EAF production method.|$|R
