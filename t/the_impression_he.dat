5|$|Borah {{considered}} challenging Hoover for renomination in 1932, but {{concluded the}} president's {{control over the}} party machinery, especially in the South, could not be overcome. Borah disagreed with the platform of the 1932 Republican National Convention over Prohibition; after the party passed a vague compromise plank and renominated Hoover, Borah made a major address on June 30, gaining nationwide attention by attacking his party's platform for forty minutes. Between then and November, he rarely mentioned Hoover's name publicly, though he said late in the campaign that he would vote for the president. He made speeches discussing issues, not candidates, and did nothing to aid Hoover's doomed campaign against Franklin D. Roosevelt. When some Idahoans demanded that he support Hoover on pain of being opposed for renomination for Senate in 1936, Borah responded that he regretted if his quarter century in the Senate had left them with <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>he</b> might be moved by such an ultimatum.|$|E
5|$|Cricket {{followers}} {{from the}} south of England remained slightly distrustful of Hutton owing to the perception that he occasionally carried professionalism to excess. When he was appointed England captain, many in the cricketing establishment held his professionalism against him {{with the result that}} Hutton never felt comfortable dealing with the amateurs who ran English cricket at the time. While captain, he was criticised for caution and negativity but also was expected to lead a successful team at a time when results began to assume a far greater importance than in previous years. Consequently, Hutton never felt secure in the position and was often uncomfortable around the amateur establishment. Like Herbert Sutcliffe, he attempted to alter his accent to match that of leading southern amateurs to help him to fit in. But he did not enjoy the attention that went with the captaincy, and he often worried about <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>he</b> was making.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the episode}} {{is based on the}} Watergate scandal, as well as other real-life {{political}} events. The two Republicans who follow Bob around were based on H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, two of Richard Nixon's closest advisors during Watergate. Sideshow Bob's campaign advert was based on the famous Willie Horton and Revolving Door political advertisements used by George H. W. Bush during the 1988 United States presidential election. Birch Barlow's question to Mayor Quimby about whether his stance on crime would differ if it was his family being attacked is a reference to Bernard Shaw's similar question to Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis during the 1988 presidential debates. Quimby's appearance during the debate parodies Richard Nixon's appearance during his first televised debate with John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. Nixon had recently recovered from a cold, and sweated considerably throughout, something that was detrimental to <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>he</b> made in the debate.|$|E

5|$|Alonso quickly progressed {{through the}} youth ranks and the reserve team at Real Sociedad (winning the regionalised fourth tier in his single {{season with the}} latter) and {{impressed}} enough to earn a first team debut {{at the age of}} 18. He made his first senior appearance against Logroñés in December 1999 in a Copa del Rey match. Alonso failed to make another appearance in the season but the following year brought more opportunities. At the beginning of the 2000–01 season, Javier Clemente sent him to Segunda División team Eibar to gain experience. Alonso's father particularly felt the move to the smaller club improved him as a player. A quick turnover of managers, however, including a two-month period with Periko Alonso in charge, left Real Sociedad in a dire situation. By January 2001, Real Sociedad were bottom of the league and its new manager, John Toshack, turned to the prodigious Alonso in the hope of reversing the team's fortunes. In a surprise move, the Welsh manager made the 20-year-old the team captain, a position traditionally held by more senior players. By the end of the season, Sociedad had climbed out of the relegation zone and finished in 14th place. Toshack lauded Alonso, noting that <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>he</b> had on the team was exceptional, especially for a player from the youth team.|$|E
5|$|When {{the teams}} reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, leading English batsman Len Hutton had been dropped. The reason {{was said to}} be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling in the {{previous}} Test, during which he scored 20 and 13. Observers noticed Hutton backing away from the fast bowlers. The English selectors believed such a sight would {{have a negative effect on}} the rest of the sidewhich was not in good batting formas it was a poor example from a key player. According to journalist and retired Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly, Hutton's second innings at Lord's had been the worst of his career and gave <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>he</b> had been scared of the Australian pace attack. The omission generated considerable controversy, and pleased the Australians, who felt Hutton was England's best batsman, and thought he had been treated poorly by the selectors. Former Australian batsman Jack Fingleton pointed out that while Hutton had batted erratically and appeared uncomfortable in the previous Test, he also had a strong track record against the tourists, having made 52 and 64 for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Australia in the lead-up matches, and 94, 76 and 122 retired ill in his last three Test innings during the previous Ashes series of 1946–47. O'Reilly regarded Hutton's omission as punitive and vindictive. He said if Hutton needed to be shielded from the new ball attack, then England should have reshuffled their batting order to place their beleaguered opener down the order. O'Reilly said that as Hutton had a large range of attacking strokes, he was not a stereotypical, defensive opener who was mainly used to wear down the opening bowlers, and could be used in the middle order as an aggressor.|$|E

25|$|From the 1830s onwards, {{numbers of}} white {{settlers}} from the Cape Colony crossed the Orange River and started {{arriving in the}} fertile southern part of territory known as the Lower Caledon Valley, which was occupied by Basotho cattle herders {{under the authority of}} the Basotho founding monarch Moshoeshoe I. In 1845, a treaty was signed between the British colonialists and Moshoeshoe, which recognised white settlement in the area. No firm boundaries were drawn between the area of white settlement and Moshoeshoe's kingdom, which led to border clashes. Moshoeshoe was under <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>he</b> was loaning grazing land to the settlers in accordance with African precepts of occupation rather than ownership, while the settlers believed they had been granted permanent land rights. Afrikaner settlers in particular were loathe to live under Moshoesoe's authority and among Africans.|$|E
25|$|After Osbourne {{left the}} Betty Ford Center {{where he had}} been treated for {{substance}} abuse, Lee presented him with the music he had written while Osbourne was away. Osbourne was purportedly very satisfied with {{the quantity and quality of}} Lee's new music, much of which would be used for the 1986 album, The Ultimate Sin. The album was awarded platinum status in May 1986 and was awarded double platinum status in October 1994. Lee and Osbourne once again toured extensively, this time with Phil Soussan on bass, John Sinclair on keyboards and Randy Castillo on drums. In Kansas City, Missouri on April 1, 1986, a concert was filmed which would be released later that year as the home video The Ultimate Ozzy. In 1987, after touring with Ozzy Osbourne in support of The Ultimate Sin album, Lee was fired in a telegram from Sharon Osbourne while working on one of his muscle cars back in Los Angeles. Lee was completely caught off guard at the time of his firing and was under <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>he</b> had a solid working gig with the Osbourne camp.|$|E
500|$|Philip French of The Observer {{considered}} that when playing {{a representative of}} bureaucracy, Le Mesurier [...] "registered something... complex. A feeling of exasperation, disturbance, anxiety [...] constantly lurked behind that handsome bloodhound face". <b>The</b> <b>impression</b> <b>he</b> gave in these roles became an [...] "inimitable brand of bewildered persistence under fire which Le Mesurier made his own". The Times noted of him that although he was {{best known for his}} comedic roles, he, [...] "could be equally effective in straight parts", as evidenced by his BAFTA-award-winning role in Traitor. Director Peter Cotes agreed, adding, [...] "he had depths unrealised through the mechanical pieces in which he generally appeared"; while Philip Oakes {{considered that}}, [...] "single-handed, he has made more films watchable, even absorbing, than anyone else around".|$|E

500|$|One further oddity in his {{writings}} is that {{in one of his}} works, the Commentary on the Seven Catholic Epistles, he writes in a manner that gives <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>he</b> was married.

Bede says: [...] "Prayers are hindered by the conjugal duty because as often as I perform what is due to my wife I am not able to pray." [...] Another passage, in the Commentary on Luke, also mentions a wife in the first person: [...] "Formerly I possessed a wife in the lustful passion of desire and now I possess her in honourable sanctification and true love of Christ." [...] The historian Benedicta Ward argues that these passages are Bede employing a rhetorical device.|$|E

[...] One of his officers climbed a tree to observe Baird's progress. [...] True to the slave's word, the trail came out near the Continental barracks, which had been left unguarded; the Continentals were unaware they had been flanked. [...] When they reached position, the man in the tree signaled by waving his hat, and Campbell ordered the regulars to charge.|$|E

500|$|Admiral Günther Lütjens {{replaced}} Marschall as {{the commander}} of the squadron, and on 20 June he sortied with Gneisenau, Admiral Hipper, and four destroyers in the direction of Iceland. His intention was to give <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>he</b> was attempting to break out into the Atlantic, to draw British attention away from Scharnhorst as she made the return voyage to Germany. About [...] northwest of Halten, however, the submarine [...] torpedoed Gneisenau. The torpedo hit the ship in the bow, just forward of the splinter belt, and caused serious damage. The ship took on a significant amount of water in the two forward watertight compartments, and she was forced to return to Trondheim at reduced speed. In Trondheim, the repair ship Huascaran effected temporary repairs that permitted the ship to return to Kiel on 25–27 July, escorted by Admiral Hipper, , four destroyers, and six torpedo boats. A strong force from the British Home Fleet attempted to intercept the flotilla, but it failed to find it. Upon arrival, Gneisenau went into drydock at the Howaldtswerke dockyard for five months of repair work. In August, the ship's commander was replaced by KzS Otto Fein, who would captain the ship for the majority of her active wartime career.|$|E
500|$|Tricky asked Mark Saunders to co-produce Maxinquaye {{after being}} {{impressed}} by his previous work with English rock band The Cure on their albums Mixed Up (1990) and Wish (1992). They recorded Maxinquaye {{in the first half}} of 1994 at Tricky's home studio in Kilburn; further recording later took place at the Loveshack and Eastcote studios in Notting Hill. Island Records, 4th & B'Way's parent label, set up equipment in the home studio at Tricky's request, including an Akai S1000 sampler, an Atari 1040 computer with Logic software, an Alesis ADAT recorder, an AKG C3000 microphone, a Behringer Composer compressor, and a Mackie 1604 mixing desk. The recording sessions were somewhat chaotic, and Saunders, who had <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>he</b> would only perform engineering duties, often found himself serving as a DJ and programmer. Tricky instructed him on what to sample, regardless of different tempos and pitches, and asked him to piece the results together, something Saunders achieved by pitch-shifting the respective samples until the combination sounded satisfactory. The samples they experimented with were taken from the many vinyl records that Saunders recalled were [...] "littered" [...] all over Tricky's floor. Influenced by dub music's production techniques, Tricky exhaustively altered borrowed sounds on his sampler, mixed tracks as they were being recorded live in the studio, and preserved sounds that otherwise would have been unwanted in the final mix, including glitches and crackles.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} session {{took place}} on 17 April, in Studio 2 at Abbey Road. Jones arrived there to find that Barrett had brought in friends of his as support musicians: Jerry Shirley, drummer with Humble Pie, and Willie Wilson, Jokers Wild's drummer, although for this occasion he was playing bass. The problem with this new set-up, though, was that the songs were recorded as Barrett played them live in the studio; on the released versions, {{a number of them}} have false starts and commentaries from Barrett. The first track Barrett and his fellow musicians worked on was [...] "No Man's Land", after Barrett had played through the song several times, to allow Shirley and Wilson to pick up the segments. Once the rehearsal was through, they went for a take, to check how the band sounded and to test the equipment from within the control room. After these tests, the band recorded three takes, the last of which became the master take for [...] "No Man's Land"; the bass, however, was re-recorded at a later date. Playing along with Barrett wasn't easy, according to Jones: [...] "It was a case of following him, not playing with him. They were seeing and then playing so they were always a note behind..." [...] Shirley said of Barrett: [...] "He gave <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>he</b> knew something you didn't. He had this music sort of giggle..." ...|$|E

Some of his staff had reservations about him. Colonel Alan Vasey, his Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General, asserted that Mackay lacked the ruthlessness to remove Militia officers who were not performing well. Vasey fumed about [...] "that bloody schoolteacher who wants to dot every 'i' and cross every 't'". Many regular officers were embittered by years of slow promotion followed by Prime Minister Robert Menzies ordering that commands in the 6th Division be given to Militia officers. Colonel Frank Berryman considered this [...] "a damn insult to the professional soldier, calculated to split the Army down the centre. We were to be the hewers of wood and the drawers of water. We, {{the only people who}} really knew the job, were to assist these Militia fellows". Berryman, who worked closely with Mackay as his chief of staff, held him in high regard. [...] "For moral and physical courage", said Berryman, [...] "few equalled him—none ever surpassed him. He was an educated and most knowledgeable soldier... and extremely patient". His Commander, Royal Australian Artillery, a reservist, Brigadier Edmund Herring, considered Mackay [...] "a most competent and able commander in North Africa and Greece, but a bit old...
