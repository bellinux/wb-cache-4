5000|$|The <b>topmark</b> {{configurations}} {{for north}} and south are self-explanatory (both cones pointing up, or both pointing down). Those for east and west [...] "follow the Sun"—the top cone points in {{the direction in which}} the rising (for an east mark) or setting (for a west mark) Sun appears to move with respect to the horizon, while the bottom cone points in the direction in which its reflection on the ocean surface appears to move.|$|E
50|$|For {{historical}} reasons, {{there are}} two systems for lateral day beacons. When proceeding from open water towards harbor, marks with cylindrical <b>topmarks</b> or square dayboards are kept to port in both regions, but colors and numbers are reversed.|$|R
50|$|Mutually {{inconsistent}} buoyage systems had proliferated in the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, leading to many accidents at sea. As {{chairman of the}} IALA Buoyage Committee, Bury oversaw the introduction in the 1970s of a standardised maritime buoyage systems, involving cardinal marks painted yellow and black with <b>topmarks</b> and lights to indicate to mariners the direction of maritime dangers, and lateral marks painted red or green to indicate whether the mark was to be passed on the port or starboard. The new standardised system was ratified in 1980, and the buoyage system remains in international use.|$|R
40|$|Isolates of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis (72 total) {{obtained}} from 30 fields in 17 melon-producing regions in South Africa were race typed, using differential cvs. CM 17187, Doublon, Perlita, and <b>Topmark,</b> and grouped {{on the basis}} of vegetative compatibility. Fifty-four isolates were identified as race 0, eight as race 1, and ten as race 2. Race 0 occurred in 15 of 17 regions, whereas race 1 was sporadically recovered. Race 2 was {{obtained from}} only four fields located in one geographic region. Perlita plants (carrying the gene Fom 3) inoculated with local isolates of races 0 and 2 and reference isolates of race 0 became stunted, and their leaves became yellow, thickened, and brittle. Using two inoculation methods, similar symptoms were induced by reference and local isolates of race 0 on Perlita seedlings. The results indicated that Fom 3 in Perlita confers a tolerant reaction compared with the resistant reaction of gene Fom 1 in Doublon and, therefore, should not be used alone in race determination tests. All isolates belonged to vegetative compatibility group 0134, indicating a high degree of genetic homogeneity among the South African F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis population. Articl...|$|E
40|$|AuxiGro® WP {{was applied}} to three cantaloupe fields in the Palo Verde Valley of far eastern California {{in the spring of}} 2004. One field {{utilized}} evaluated high rates (3. 4 x higher than other fields for each rate) of AuxiGro® WP for the purposes of phytotoxicity observations, while either a single application or two applications of varying rates of AuxiGro® WP were applied in the other two fields respectively. No visual symptoms of phytotoxicity were noted for AuxiGro® WP in any of the fields where applied, including two honeydew fields in the fall of 2003. Applications of any rate of AuxiGro® WP did not result in a statistical increase in numbers of melons from either a single or a double application on either variety (Ranger, <b>Topmark</b> respectively) used for yield data in this experiment. Data indicated that statistical differences existed for some melon parameters between treatments means in the hybrid variety (Ranger) but these statistical differences were not present for most fruit parameters in the open pollinated variety (<b>Topmark),</b> although some of the same trends were noted. These differences may be due to differing lengths of time from application to harvest. Of only the four rates of AuxiGro® WP evaluated, the heaviest melons were noted in the 4 oz. /acre rate followed by the 8 oz. /acre rate in both cantaloupe varieties, with this rate resulting in slightly heavier cantaloupes than the untreated check in both varieties. The one oz. /acre rate of AuxiGro® WP also resulted in slightly shorter and lighter melons for both varieties than did application of only Solar™, but brix was numerically higher for this rate of AuxiGro® WP than for the Solar™ treatment. The two lowest mean brix were noted from in both cantaloupe varieties treated by Solar™ treatment alone and the 4 oz. /acre rate of AuxiGro® WP + CalMax treatment, with these means being statistically less than the untreated check in 'Ranger' cantaloupes. CalMax by itself resulted in slightly smaller melons than the untreated check in both melon varieties. The AuxiGro® WP + CalMax treatment resulted in the largest melons (both longest and widest) of any treatment in the 'Ranger' cantaloupe field, with the difference in length being statistically greater than CalMax alone. Although larger melons would normally be thought to ripen earlier and therefore have higher brix readings, usage of AuxiGro® WP in combination with CalMax is thought to reduce stress as plants are still quite actively growing, hence the lower brix readings...|$|E
