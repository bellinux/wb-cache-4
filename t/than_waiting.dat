5|$|Smallpeice, {{with support}} from E. H. Carr who was then {{assistant}} editor of The Times, promoted the idea of employers deducting income tax from wages and passing it to Government directly rather <b>than</b> <b>waiting</b> for employees to do {{so at the end}} of the financial year. He introduced this idea to Paul Chambers, then on the board of the Inland Revenue. The idea, which became the PAYE system, would be tested in 1940–1941 and introduced permanently in 1944. The system vastly simplified and increased tax collection during the latter stages of World War II, when Britain was in desperate need of funds.|$|E
5|$|Women in Washington social circles led by Floride Calhoun, {{the wife}} of Vice President John C. Calhoun, snubbed the Eatons because they married so soon after John Timberlake's death, rather <b>than</b> <b>waiting</b> for the usual {{mourning}} period; there were stories that Eaton and Peggy Timberlake had been having an affair before John Timberlake had died. Rumors held that Peggy, as a barmaid in her father's tavern, had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute. Petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members, led by Mrs. Calhoun, refused to socialize with the Eatons. They refused to attend social events at which she would be present. According to Emily Donelson, Eaton considered resigning in {{the first months of}} the administration.|$|E

5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on May 3, 2006, The New York Times addressed the controversy. The paper acknowledged that the mainstream media—itself included—had been criticized for focusing on Bush's act with Bridges while ignoring Colbert's speech. The paper then quoted several passages of Colbert's more substantial criticism {{of the president and}} discussed various reactions to the event. On May 15, The New York Times public editor, Byron Calame, wrote on his blog that more than two hundred readers had written to complain about the exclusion of any mention of Colbert from the paper's initial lengthy article covering the dinner. Calame quoted his deputy bureau chief in Washington, who said that a mention of Colbert in the first article could not have been long enough to do his routine justice. But he also noted that the paper should have printed an in-depth article specifically covering Colbert's speech in the same issue, rather <b>than</b> <b>waiting</b> until days after the fact.|$|E
5|$|Kusaka {{correctly}} {{saw these}} strikes as {{a precursor to}} U.S. troop landings, {{in part due to}} Imperial Navy intelligence collected over the previous week. Because he was still unsure exactly where enemy forces would land, he chose to execute the air component of Sho-1 or Sho-2the planned defense of the Philippines or Formosa, respectivelyon the morning of 10October. Sho was a complex plan involving multiple naval surface forces sortieing from bases as far away as Singapore and Japan. It would take these warships time to maneuver into position for a concerted attack. Rather <b>than</b> <b>waiting</b> for the arrival of the fleet for a combination of sea and air power, Kusaka ordered the air forces reserved for Sho to engage the enemy at once. He reinforced this order by implementing Sho-2 in full on the morning of 12October.|$|E
5|$|The 16 sailors on Tahiti {{began to}} organise their lives. One group, led by Morrison and Tom McIntosh, began {{building}} a schooner, which they named Resolution after Cook's ship. Morrison {{had not been}} an active mutineer; rather <b>than</b> <b>waiting</b> for recapture, he hoped to sail the vessel to the Dutch East Indies and surrender to the authorities there, hoping that such action would confirm his innocence. Morrison's group maintained ship's routine and discipline, even {{to the extent of}} holding divine service each Sunday. Churchill and Matthew Thompson, on the other hand, chose to lead drunken and generally dissolute lives, which ended in the violent deaths of both. Churchill was murdered by Thompson, who was in turn killed by Churchill's native friends. Others, such as Stewart and Heywood, settled into quiet domesticity; Heywood spent much of his time studying the Tahitian language. He adopted native dress and, in accordance with the local custom, was heavily tattooed on his body.|$|E

5|$|The programmers {{suggested}} using 3D Studio Max for art {{and level}} design, which would {{save money by}} allowing the company to license {{a single piece of}} software, but the lead artists successfully lobbied against this plan, believing that allowing the respective teams to choose the software would allow them to work most efficiently. Huebner said this saved the project more time than any other decision made during development. The level designers chose QERadiant to take advantage of their previous experience using the software while working on Id Software's Quake series. Id allowed Nihilistic to license QERadiant and modify it to create a customized tool for its 3D environments. Because QERadiant was a finished, functional tool, it allowed the level designers to begin developing levels from the project's start and then export them into the NOD engine, rather <b>than</b> <b>waiting</b> for up to six months for Nihilistic to develop a custom tool or learning a new 3D level editor. In twenty-four months, the three level designers built over 100 in-game environments for Redemption. They obtained blueprints and sketches of buildings from medieval Prague and Vienna to better represent that period and locations. The four-person art team led by Kraaijvanger used Alias Wavefront Maya to create 3D art. Nihilistic's management wanted Kraaijvanger to use a less expensive tool but relented when the cost was found to be lower than had been thought. Throughout the project, the art team built over 1,500 3D models.|$|E
