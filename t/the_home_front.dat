5|$|After the war, {{some women}} who had been {{especially}} active in supporting the war on <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>front</b> turned their organizational skills to other concerns, especially prohibition and woman suffrage. In 1874, for example, Zerelda Wallace, the wife of former Indiana governor David Wallace and stepmother of General Lew Wallace, became a founder of the Indiana chapter of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and served as its first president.|$|E
5|$|Although many {{publications}} have repeated Doyle's unsupported {{assertion that}} the wartime photograph inspired Miller's poster, Westinghouse historian Charles A. Ruch, a Pittsburgh resident who had been friends with J. Howard Miller, said that Miller {{was not in the}} habit of working from photographs, but rather live models. Penny Coleman, the author of Rosie the Riveter: Women working on <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>front</b> in World War II, said that she and Ruch could not determine whether the wartime photo had appeared in any of the periodicals that Miller would have seen.|$|E
5|$|Grayburn was {{promoted}} to war substantive lieutenant in 1942 and married Marcelle Chambers, {{with whom he had}} a son, in the same year. However, the Ox and Bucks remained on <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>front</b> and Grayburn became bored with the inactivity. Instead he applied to the Parachute Regiment and in June 1943 he was transferred to the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion. The following year he was transferred to the regiment's 2nd Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Frost, and took command of 2 Platoon, A Company.|$|E

5|$|Hispanic {{women were}} {{discouraged}} from {{working outside the}} home prior to World War II, even more than other American women.

5|$|Women also volunteered {{and served}} in a {{non-combatant}} role; {{by the end of}} the war, 80,000 had enlisted. They mostly served as nurses in the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS), the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY), the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD); and from 1917, in the Army when the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC), was founded. The WAAC was divided into four sections: cookery; mechanical; clerical and miscellaneous. Most stayed on <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Front,</b> but around 9,000 served in France.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor {{was also}} active on <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>front.</b> Beginning in 1941, she co-chaired the Office of Civilian Defense (OCD) with New York City Mayor Fiorello H.

Though LaGuardia resigned from the OCD in December 1941, Eleanor {{was forced to resign}} following anger in the House of Representatives over high salaries for several OCD appointments, including two of her close friends.|$|E
5|$|Throughout World War I the Australian forces {{deployed}} overseas {{were all}} volunteers, however, on <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>front</b> {{there was considerable}} debate {{about the issue of}} conscription. Conscription had been a contentious issue ever since Federation and when the AIF was initially raised in 1914 it had been decided that it would be an all-volunteer force due to the provisions of the Defence Act that precluded sending conscripts overseas. Nevertheless, as the war progressed, casualties amongst the deployed forces began to reach alarming rates and as the flow of reinforcements and recruits for the AIF began to drop in 1916, the issue of conscription rose once more.|$|E

5|$|Born in Auckland, Bassett was a bank worker {{when the}} First World War began. A member of New Zealand's Territorial Force, he volunteered for service abroad with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) and was posted to the New Zealand Divisional Signal Company as a sapper. He saw {{action on the}} opening day of the Gallipoli Campaign, and it was during the Battle of Chunuk Bair that he {{performed}} the actions that led to his award of the VC. Medically evacuated due to sickness shortly after the battle, he later served on the Western Front and finished the war as a second lieutenant. He returned to the banking profession but was recalled to active duty during the Second World War. He served on <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Front</b> {{and by the time he}} was taken off active duty in December 1943, he had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and was commander of signals in the Northern Military District. When he retired from his banking career he became a justice of the peace in Devonport. He died in 1983 at the age of 91.|$|E
5|$|By May 1944, {{the parishioners}} {{had contributed to}} the war having given {{thousands}} of pints of blood to the Blood Banks; given money to the war relief campaigns; been active on <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>front,</b> and sent 808 {{men and women to}} the Armed Forces. There was a group that prepared and sent out a weekly special bulletin to the parishioners in the Armed Forces. These parishioners were happy to receive news from home on the progress of their new church and many of them sent home money to go towards the building fund. During the war, hundreds of dollars came in from these parishioners fighting in the war. Of the 808 parishioners who went off to war, seven died and their names were engraved on a piece of granite outside of the church: James DiMuzio, Arthur Capo, Nick Costelli, Justine DeFelices, Neal Chipoletti, and Anthony Zaffuto.|$|E
5|$|Fighting would rage across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia for {{the next}} four years. On 8 January 1918, United States President Woodrow Wilson issued a {{statement}} that became known as the Fourteen Points. In part, this speech called for the Central Powers to withdraw from the territories they had occupied, {{for the creation of a}} Polish state, the redrawing of Europe's borders along ethnic ("national") lines, and the formation of a League of Nations. During the northern-hemisphere autumn of 1918, the Central Powers began to collapse. The German military suffered a decisive defeat on the Western Front, while on <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Front</b> the Imperial German Navy mutinied, prompting uprisings in Germany which became known as the German Revolution. The German government attempted to obtain a peace settlement based on the Fourteen Points, and maintained it was on this basis that Germany surrendered. Following negotiations, the Allied Powers and Germany signed an armistice, which came into effect on 11 November while German forces were still positioned in France and Belgium.|$|E

5|$|On {{volunteering}} {{for service}} in the war, Hargest sought to serve abroad in command {{of one of the}} infantry brigades of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF). However, the newly appointed commander of the 2NZEF, Major General Bernard Freyberg was concerned about the age and command experience of some potential senior officers of the 2NZEF such as Hargest. A subsequent medical assessment deemed Hargest fit only for service on <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Front</b> as he was still prone to bouts of shell shock from his service during the First World War. Disappointed with this decision, he approached Peter Fraser, the acting Prime Minister of New Zealand, with a request for a brigade command in 2NZEF. Fraser disregarded official advice and arranged for Hargest to be appointed commander of the 5th Infantry Brigade. At the time, the Chief of the General Staff of the New Zealand Military Forces, Major-General John Duigan, wrote to Freyberg, disassociating himself from the decision.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia had no {{diplomatic}} powers, but largely oversaw its own {{contributions of}} manpower and materiel {{to the war}} effort, being responsible for its own defence. Rhodesian officers and soldiers were distributed in small groups throughout the British and South African forces {{in an attempt to}} prevent high losses. Most of the colony's men served in Britain, East Africa and the Mediterranean, particularly at first; a more broad dispersal occurred from late 1942. Rhodesian servicemen in operational areas were mostly from the country's white minority, with the Rhodesian African Rifles—made up of black troops and white officers—providing the main exception in Burma from late 1944. Other non-white soldiers and white servicewomen served in East Africa and on <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>front</b> within Southern Rhodesia. Tens of thousands of black men were conscripted from rural communities for work, first on the aerodromes and later on white-owned farms.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>front</b> he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E
