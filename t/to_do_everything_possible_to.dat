500|$|Controversy {{arose in}} Germany for the film's {{television}} premiere on ProSieben. Protests among the Jewish community ensued when the station intended to televise it with two commercial breaks of 3–4 minutes each. Ignatz Bubis, {{head of the}} Central Council of Jews in Germany, said: [...] "It is problematic to interrupt such a movie by commercials". Jerzy Kanal, chairman of the Jewish Community of Berlin, added [...] "It {{is obvious that the}} film could have a greater impact [...] when broadcast unimpeded by commercials. The station has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> broadcast the film without interruption." [...] As a compromise, the broadcast included one break consisting of a short news update framed with commercials. ProSieben was also obliged to broadcast two accompanying documentaries to the film, showing [...] "The daily lives of the Jews in Hebron and New York" [...] prior to broadcast and [...] "The survivors of the Holocaust" [...] afterwards.|$|E
500|$|At the {{hospital}} of La Pitié, he studied under internal pathologist Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis, who demonstrated the ineffectiveness of bloodletting, {{which had been}} a mainstay of medical practice since antiquity. Dr. Louis {{was one of the}} fathers of the méthode expectante, a therapeutic doctrine that states the physician's role is <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> aid nature in the process of disease recovery, and to do nothing to hinder this natural process. Upon his return to Boston, Holmes became one of the country's leading proponents of the méthode expectante. Holmes was awarded his M.D. from Harvard in 1836; he wrote his dissertation on acute pericarditis. His first collection of poetry was published later that year, but Holmes, ready to begin his medical career, wrote it off as a one-time event. In the book's introduction, he mused: [...] "Already engaged in other duties, it has been with some effort that I have found time to adjust my own mantle; and I now willingly retire to more quiet labors, which, if less exciting, are more certain to be acknowledged as useful and received with gratitude".|$|E

After the war escalated, German public opinion turned against Russia, with 79% saying they had an unfavourable view of Russia and 82% saying Russia could not be trusted in an August 2014 poll. Ukrainian-American historian Alexander J.

This is not a mere casual article in a newspaper—it is the declaration of the aim and object for which it is established, and of the design with which its promoters have set out; that object being <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> drive the people of Ireland to sedition, to urge them into open rebellion, and to promote civil war for the purpose of exterminating every Englishman in Ireland. I hope, my Lords, her Majesty's Government will not {{say that this is a}} matter quite in theory—that it is below contempt, and that we should allow it to pass by in silence. If such a publication had appeared in England, I should have been very much inclined to think the good sense and sound judgment of the people would have rejected the article at once as a seditious invective, whose very violence, like an overdose of poison, prevented its effect.|$|E

50|$|Some idioms are transparent. Much {{of their}} meaning does get through {{if they are}} taken (or translated) literally. For example, lay one's {{cards on the table}} meaning to reveal {{previously}} unknown intentions, or to reveal a secret. Transparency is a matter of degree; spill the beans (to let secret information become known) and leave no stone unturned (<b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> in order <b>to</b> achieve or find something) are not entirely literally interpretable, but only involve a slight metaphorical broadening. Another category of idioms is a word having several meanings, sometimes simultaneously, sometimes discerned from the context of its usage. This is seen in the (mostly uninflected) English language in polysemes, the common use of the same word for an activity, for those engaged in it, for the product used, for the place or time of an activity, and sometimes for a verb.|$|R
500|$|The OUN {{decided to}} attack Polish civilians, who {{constituted}} {{about a third}} of the population of the disputed territories. The OUN equated Ukrainian independence with ethnic homogeneity; the Polish presence had to be removed completely. By February 1943 the OUN began a deliberate campaign of murdering Polish civilians. OUN forces targeted Polish villages, prompting the formation of Polish self-defense units (e.g., the Przebraże Defence) and fights between the Home Army and the OUN. The Germans encouraged both sides against each other; Erich Koch said: [...] "We have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> so that a Pole, when meeting a Ukrainian, will be ready to kill him, and conversely, a Ukrainian will be ready to kill the Pole." [...] A German commissioner from Sarny, when local Poles complained about massacres, answered: [...] "You want Sikorski, the Ukrainians want Bandera. Fight each other."

60|$|The {{creative}} impulses, {{unlike those}} that are possessive, are directed to ends in which one man's gain is not another man's loss. The man who makes a scientific discovery or writes a poem is enriching others {{at the same time}} as himself. Any increase in knowledge or good-will is a gain to all who are affected by it, not only to the actual possessor. Those who feel the joy of life are a happiness to others as well as to themselves. Force cannot create such things, though it can destroy them; no principle of distributive justice applies to them, since the gain of each is the gain of all. For these reasons, the creative part of a man's activity ought to be as free as possible from all public control, in order that it may remain spontaneous and full of vigor. The only function of the state in regard to this part of the individual life should be <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> toward providing outlets and opportunities.|$|R

Other activation programs included several road shows on many traffic light areas in New Delhi and grand celebration of the World Environment Day at the India Gate.

40|$|Physician, {{regulate}} thyself! We {{could not}} agree more with aCMAJ editorial 1 that suggests confidence in physicians {{is at the core}} of what we do. We also agree that strong licensing and regulatory bodies are needed. Long before the Shipman case came to light in the United Kingdom, med-ical regulatory authorities in Canada began making significant progress to-ward transparency and increased public accountability. There are now more public representatives on the councils of the regulatory authorities, and most disciplinary hearings are open to the public and the media. Furthermore, the medical regula-tory authorities recognize that a physi-cian’s performance may decline over time, and that the quality and safety of any individual physician’s practice need regular review. Thus, the top priority for the Federation of Medical Regula-tory Authorities of Canada is revalida-tion of licensure. Medical regulatory authorities around the world are examining the recommendations in the fifth report of the Shipman Inquiry 2 with a view <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> prevent a similar occurrence in their own juris-dictions.

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted {{to the role of the}} railway {{transport}} in migration from the frontline to the Soviet rear during the Great Patriotic War. The research is based on the analysis of the published and archival documents, personal diaries, letters, memoirs, texts of interview with the people who lived through the evacuation. The methodological foundation of the research was based on the theoretical principles made by the Everyday History. Surge attack of the German troops and cruel occupational policy caused the necessity of evacuation of civilians to the Eastern regions of the country. The evacuation was both spontaneous and organized and helped to save millions of human lives. The lack of evacuation plans in case of a war, incompleteness of the railway transport renovation, transport routes destroyed by the enemy and the stream of refugees were among the main factors which complicated evacuation process. The conditions of transportation differed according to the time and the circumstances of the evacuation and a person’s position in social hierarchy. There were some problems during the evacuation, such as regulation of the rail service, sanitation of the carriages, nutrition system, psychological shock. People had to spend weeks in the carriages suffering from cold, hunger and diseases. During the evacuation a new alternative reality appeared with its rules and regulations which changed the concepts of tangible assets and moral values. The priority for any person was to survive, which meant to be independent and <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible...</b>|$|R
