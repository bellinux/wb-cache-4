40|$|This paper investigates labor {{supply and}} redistributive effects of in-work {{benefits}} for Italian married couples using a tax-benefit microsimulation model and a multi-sectoral discrete choice model of labor supply. We consider two in-work benefit schemes following the key {{principles of the}} Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Working Tax Credit (WTC) existing in the US and the UK, respectively. The standard design of these in-work benefits is however augmented with a new benefit premium for two-earner households in order to overcome the well-known disincentive effects that these welfare instruments may generate on secondary earners. In simulation, the proposed in-work benefits are financed through the abolition of Italian family allowances for dependent employees and contingent workers thus ensuring <b>tax</b> revenue <b>neutrality.</b> We show that our EITC and WTC reforms have strong positive effects on labor supply of wives, weak negative effects on labor supply of husbands, and strong positive effects on equity. The EITC {{is more effective than}} the WTC in boosting employment of wives, while the WTC is more effective than the EITC in fighting poverty. In both schemes, the trade-off between labor supply incentives and redistributive effects is crucially related to the new benefit premium for two-earner households. Other things being equal, <b>tax</b> revenue <b>neutrality</b> implies that a higher value of this policy coefficient yields stronger incentive effects and weaker redistributive effects...|$|R

Another is the impact of international arrangements among countries in a global business environment to guide consistent regulatory responses and to identify and share information.

Both {{countries}} introduced corporate tax on foreign firms, exempting local firms from corporate tax, when they moved away from a pre-existing Islamic <b>tax</b> <b>neutrality</b> policy. These reforms were implemented in 2009 in Oman and in 2004 in Saudi Arabia. These tax reform events - applying to foreign firms and not applying to local firms in the same markets - offer ideal experimental situations in two economies to test the taxation theories on how stock prices must react. We find that the results support the Modigliani- Miller and Elton-Gruber tax theories in two ways. Firstly, foreign firms that had their taxes reduced experienced stock price increases. Secondly, local firms not subjected to tax or tax reduction showed no visible tax effect. These are theory-consistent findings in the unique tax environments in these two Islamic countries, which moved away from <b>tax</b> <b>neutrality,</b> enabling us to obtain very clear evidence on modern theories of taxation.

The first aim {{of the study is}} to systematise and analyse the methods for elimination of double taxation under double tax treaties in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of how they work. A number of issues relating to the application of these methods are analysed. Since double tax treaties are applied by tax authorities, courts, and taxpayers in a domestic law context, i. e. within the framework of the legal system of a particular state, the analysis focuses on the application in Sweden of the methods for elimination of double taxation under double tax treaties. The second aim of the study is to evaluate in a few selected situations the two main methods for elimination of double taxation recommended by the OECD, namely exemption with progression and ordinary credit, on the basis of whether <b>tax</b> <b>neutrality</b> is achieved. For the purpose of this study, <b>tax</b> <b>neutrality</b> is deemed to be achieved when the taxation of income relating to a cross border transaction corresponds to the tax that would have been levied in either the state of residence (i. e. capital export neutrality, “CEN”) or in the other contracting state (i. e. capital import neutrality, “CIN”), had the cross border element not been present. Furthermore, for the purpose of this study, <b>tax</b> <b>neutrality</b> is deemed to be achieved if the taxation of income relating to a cross border transaction is within the range set by CEN and CIN.

40|$|ABSTRACT Law n. 11, 638 / 2007 legitimized the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) {{adoption}} {{process in}} Brazil and introduced an accounting system detached from tax purposes in the country. This law aims {{to reduce the}} influence of tax law on accounting standards and {{improve the quality of}} financial reporting, as IFRS are considered to be higher quality standards. International literature shows a reduction in earnings quality in environments where accounting and tax rules are strongly linked. Moreover, the influence of tax legislation on financial accounting is seen to encourage unconditional conservatism, a bias with no advantages for financial market efficiency. Thus, <b>tax</b> <b>neutrality</b> is expected to provide a more favorable institutional environment for quality financial reporting by detaching corporate accounting from tax accounting. In light of the above, this study aims to verify whether the advent of <b>tax</b> <b>neutrality</b> influences unconditional conservatism in Brazilian public companies. The methodology used involves panel data regressions. The sample consists of non-financial publicly-traded companies with information published in Economática® covering 2002 to 2014. The results show differences in the relationship between taxation and financial reporting between firms that are subject to different levels of monitoring in the Brazilian stock market. Evidence of unconditional conservatism is only found in companies that are subject to greater market monitoring. In this group, it is observed that taxation does not induce unconditional conservatism in reported earnings, which is expected in a <b>tax</b> <b>neutrality</b> context...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{numerical simulation}} results {{that suggest that}} China can both reduce its trade imbalance and receive welfare benefits by switching the value added tax (VAT) regime from the current destination principle to an origin principle. With the tax on exports exceeding that no longer collected on imports, revenues rise and exports fall. VAT regime switching is thus a possibility for China to receive a double benefit, rebalancing trade with a welfare gain. This has implications for present G 20 discussions on finding ways to adjust global trade imbalances. Under a destination principle, imports are taxed but input taxes are rebated on exports (as currently). Under an origin basis imports are not taxed, but no export rebates are given. Previous VAT literature stresses the <b>neutrality</b> of <b>tax</b> basis switches, which simply reflect moving between consumption and production <b>taxes,</b> but <b>neutrality</b> only holds when trade is balanced. In the unbalanced trade case for countries with a trade surplus, such as China, an origin basis offers a lower tax rate on an equal yield basis and reduced exports. We use a two country endogenous trade imbalance general equilibrium global trade model with endogenous factor supply, a fixed exchange rate and a non-accommodative monetary policy structure which supports the Chinese trade imbalance. We calibrate model parameters to 2008 data and simulate counterfactual equilibria for VAT tax basis switches in which the trade imbalance changes. Our results suggest that given China’s trade surplus VAT regime switching to an origin can decrease China’s trade surplus by over 50 %, and additionally increase Chinese and world welfare. The rest of the world’s production and welfare improves simultaneously. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{validity}} of permanent establishment (PE) as the decisive condition for source state jurisdiction for business profits {{depends on the}} practical and normative importance of an enterprise’s physical presence on foreign markets. E-commerce enterprises can operate in foreign markets without physical presence there. It is therefore necessary to assess alternatives to PE {{and to do so}} in accordance with appropriate normative and policy criteria. The historical context does not illuminate criteria because the PE rule is a product mainly of now obsolete economic and political conditions and the fiscal self-interest of capital exporting nations. Any normative principle of fiscal jurisdiction must explain power to tax and how to avoid overlapping powers to tax. Benefit theory does so best. Benefit theory supports source-based taxation of business profits generally and particularly provides that a country hosting a consumer market has jurisdiction for income of non-resident e-commerce enterprises that is attributable to the sales functions involved in e-commerce transactions. This requires a ‘virtual’ PE fiction in <b>tax</b> treaties. <b>Neutrality</b> and administrative considerations might militate against that in treaty relations between developed nations. However, inter-nation equity affects relations involving developing countries. ‘Inter-nation equity’ is an ethical concept of fairness requiring that allocation of taxing rights should benefit developing countries. Accordingly, as changes to the OECD Model have reduced source-based taxation of e-commerce compared to equivalent ‘traditional’ commerce and as most developing countries will remain ‘source’ countries vis-à-vis e-commerce, so the PE rule infringes inter-nation equity. Inter-nation equity overrides neutrality and administrative considerations. It is for developing nations to decide whether to tax e-commerce at source. Collection of revenue by the residence country followed by transfer of the revenue to source countries would best achieve that. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|When home {{ownership}} {{is the dominant}} tenure form in any country, the fiscal subsidies directed towards it need continual reassessment. This paper updates an earlier study on direct and indirect assistance to {{home ownership}} in Australia, {{a country with a}} mature home ownership sector. It examines the changing pattern of deposit assistance provided to first homebuyers and the trends in indirect assistance provided through the tax system, with tenure neutrality taken as the preferred tax expenditure benchmark. It was motivated by a significant growth in real dwelling values and changes to the tax system since the mid- 1980 s that have resulted in increased tax concessions to owner-occupiers. Indirect assistance is shown to dominate direct assistance and is poorly targeted, with the greatest amount of assistance being provided to those households who need it least. On a per household basis, outright owners receive more than five times the amount received by those with a mortgage, with high-income outright owners receiving an estimated benefit of close to $ 9, 000 (€ 5, 400) per annum.

Several new results are established concerning the interactions of taxes that might be used by a government to alter short and long run forest capital stocks: (i) the presence of a forest bequest <b>tax</b> affects the <b>neutrality</b> of harvest <b>tax</b> in both the short and long run, (ii) in the long run the bequest tax decreases bequests and timber supplies. When the bequest tax is not present, the capital income tax is neutral with respect to bequest and timber supply, while the harvest tax is neutral only if forest productivity is also not taxed. Finally, (iii) in the short run, the substitution and total effects of taxes in landowner decisions generally depend on the presence of the bequest tax.
