5|$|A common {{justification}} for <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for astronomy is <b>the</b> <b>need</b> {{to develop an}} accurate calendar for agricultural reasons. Ancient texts like Hesiod's Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this. Instead astronomical observations are used in combination with ecological signs, such as bird migrations to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical work with the Mursi of Ethiopia shows that haphazard astronomy continued until recent times {{in some parts of}} the world. All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.|$|E

40|$|The paper, {{which is}} a summary of a longer study, {{presents}} the most important conceptual and methodological approaches to the identification of <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> for adult education. The conceptual approaches {{are related to the}} theoretical treatment of <b>the</b> <b>needs,</b> such as <b>the</b> behaviourist and development-humanist theory of <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> applied in psychology, <b>the</b> class-strata <b>needs</b> theory developed by sociologists, and an understanding of the needs characteristic of marketing. A special chapter considers the applicability of individual conceptual approaches to identification of <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> for adult education within higher education. A consequence of multiplicity of conceptual approaches to the identification of <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> is a methodological pluralism which becomes evident in empirical work. In the subsequent chapter the author outlines the already established methods for identification of <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> and "a case study" carried out by the researchers of the former Centre for the Development of the University. In the conclusion the author makes a few proposals for improvement of the identification of <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> for adult education in the sphere of Slovenian higher education...|$|R

30|$|In {{an ideal}} setting, this {{allocation}} would address <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of all users {{in a way}} that maximizes economic welfare. Regrettably, for multiple reasons, this rarely happens. First, there is bias in the prioritization of <b>the</b> <b>needs.</b> It is a well-known fact that, for understandable political reasons, most decision-makers are very sensitive to <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of passenger-related traffic; while being much less supportive of <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of freight and service activity (FSA). This is reflected in the adage “freight doesn’t vote”, frequently used by freight advocates to explain the tendency of decision-makers to disregard <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of freight activity. As a result, addressing <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of <b>the</b> traffic associated with pick-up and delivery of cargo and the ones related to the provision of services at commercial establishments and households are relegated to lower priorities. A second reason is the profound lack of awareness of the magnitude, scope, and importance of FSA; which leads to a situation where well-meaning decision-makers may not even be aware of <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of FSA, or may honestly perceive that these needs are being met in other ways.|$|R
