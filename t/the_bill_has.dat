50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>had</b> not beaten <b>the</b> Miami Dolphins in {{the entire}} decade of the 1970s, a streak of twenty {{straight}} losses, the longest in NFL history. The last time <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>had</b> defeated Miami was 1969.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>bill</b> was {{supported}} by many Canadian police agencies. Supporters of <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>have</b> stated that all Canada's attorneys-general also support <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> while critics <b>have</b> challenged that as untrue.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> {{support of}} Republicans {{and much of}} the Tea Party movement. It passed the U.S. House of Representatives on July 19, 2011, but was {{rejected}} by the President and the Senate. The Senate voted to table <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> on July 22. President Obama had promised to veto <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>had</b> it proceeded further.|$|R
5|$|Portland Bill is the {{southern}} tip of the island of Portland. <b>The</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>has</b> three lighthouse towers: The Higher Lighthouse is now a dwelling and holiday apartments; the Lower Lighthouse is now a bird observatory and field centre providing records of bird migration and accommodation for visitors, which opened in 1961. The white and red lighthouse on Bill Point replaced the Higher and Lower Lighthouses in 1906. It is a prominent and much photographed feature; an important landmark for ships passing the headland and its tidal race. The current lighthouse was refurbished in 1996 and became remotely controlled. It now contains a visitors' centre giving information and guided tours of the lighthouse. As of June 2009, the lighthouse uses a 1kW metal-halide US-made lamp with an operational life of about 4000 hours, or 14 months.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>has</b> {{become a}} popular drama in the United Kingdom and in many other countries, most notably in Australia. The series {{attracted}} audiences of up to six million viewers in 2008 and 2009. Ratings during 2002 peaked after the overhaul of the show which brought about the 2002 fire episode, in which six officers were killed and the 2003 live episode attracted ten million viewers- {{forty percent of the}} UK audience share. Immediately following The Bills revamping and time slot change, it was reported that the programme had attracted 4.5million viewers, 19% of the audience share, however, it lost out to the BBC's New Tricks with the Daily Mirror later reporting that ITV's schedule change was behind a two million viewer drop in ratings.|$|E
5|$|As regards a bill {{mentioned}} in paragraph 1, the President, acting {{in accordance with}} the advice of the Cabinet, may refer to a Constitutional Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill circumvents or curtails the discretionary powers conferred on him or her by the Constitution. If the Tribunal is of the opinion that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day after the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal feels that the bill does have the circumventing or curtailing effect, and the President either has withheld or withholds his assent to the bill, the Prime Minister may direct that the bill be submitted to the electors for a national referendum. In that case, the bill only becomes law if it is supported by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast at the referendum. If 30 days have expired after a bill has been presented to the President for assent and he or she has neither signified the withholding of assent nor referred the Bill to a Constitutional Tribunal, the bill is deemed to have been assented to on the day following the expiry of the 30-day period. The procedure is similar for a bill {{mentioned in}} paragraph 2, except that if the Constitutional Tribunal rules that <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>has</b> a circumventing or curtailing effect, the Prime Minister has no power to put the bill to a referendum. This ensures that changes to the President's discretionary powers can only be made by way of constitutional amendments and not ordinary statutes.|$|E
50|$|On 8 February 2006, it was {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>had</b> been shelved because of insufficient time to prepare the necessary amendments, but Prime Minister Qarase denied this. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>had</b> not been shelved, and would not be, he insisted, but it would not be voted upon by the present session of Parliament.|$|R

25|$|On January 30, 2014 California Assemblyperson Isadore Hall (D – Compton, 64th District) {{introduced}} Assembly Bill 1576. Like its failed predecessor, AB640 in 2013 (also {{introduced by}} Hall), {{the bill is}} a statewide version of Measure B that affects Los Angeles County only and makes it a criminal offense to violate its provisions. The bill also imposes a controversial government mandate on testing, forcing producers to disclose performers' STI test details to the Department of Industrial Relations. As of June 2014 <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>has</b> passed through the Labor and Employment (04/01/14), ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT, SPORTS, TOURISM, AND INTERNET MEDIA (04/28/14), APPROPRIATIONS (05/20/14), and ASSEMBLY FLOOR ANALYSIS (5/22/14) committees.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>had</b> a large regular cast {{to support}} the number of episodes that were {{produced}} each year.

A number of cast members have played multiple roles in the series, and in other British soap operas and dramas.|$|R

On 3 November 2010 the Commerce Committee reported on <b>the</b> <b>Bill,</b> then Bill 119-2. On 12 April 2011 <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>had</b> its second reading, {{committee of the whole}} House and third reading. <b>The</b> <b>Bill</b> received royal assent on 18 April 2011 and became an Act of Parliament.|$|R

25|$|The Bill {{provides}} us with a framework to establish objectives with a biophysical bottom line that must not be compromised. Provided that those objectives are met, what people get up to is their affair. As such, the Bill provides a more liberal regime for developers. On the other hand, activities {{will have to be}} compatible with hard environmental standards and society will set those standards. Clause 4 sets out the biophysical bottom line. Clauses 5 and 6 set out further specific matters that expand on the issues. <b>The</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>has</b> a clear and rigorous procedure for the setting of environmental standards – and the debate will be concentrating on just where we set those standards.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} moult, white down begins to return when the chicks are seven weeks old, {{followed}} by white semi-plumes then white contour feathers. The first white basic plumage is complete {{after three months}} and resembles that of adults. By this time, the legs and feet are now an incipient pink and <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>has</b> become bicoloured (pale blue and maroon). Although the young now resemble adults, the skin surrounding the eye remains black {{for about a year}} before turning red, and the dark brown iris does not begin to yellow until after two years old. These are two potentially useful features that identify juvenile maguari storks; but in the field, the dark iris of the juveniles is the most reliable feature that distinguishes them from adults.|$|E
25|$|The Filipino Veterans Fairness Act is {{the name}} of a number of acts that have been {{introduced}} to the United States Congress in both the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate since the 103rd Congress in 1993. Since then, nearly every session of Congress has seen {{a new version of the}} bill introduced. The purpose of these bills is to amend Title 38 of the United States Code to grant citizenship to Filipinos who have completed an enlistment in the American Armed Forces; at least some versions of this bill would grant citizenship to other foreign nationals under the same provisions. Currently, every version of the bill introduced has died in committee. Despite this, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>has</b> been re-introduced in nearly every session of Congress since 1993.|$|E

25|$|The state {{government}} decided to repeal an existing Bill {{passed by the}} Left Front Government in 2009, which had not received {{the approval of the}} President of India. On 30 April 2013 the new Bill—The West Bengal Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments Bill (2013), was passed in a two-day special session of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly. The new law has provisions for retrospective effect, search and seizure, enhanced penalties, establishment of special courts and confiscation of property. As the Bill pertained to the Concurrent List of the Indian Constitution, on which a federal law was already in place, it required approval from the President. The Bill was sent to the Union Home Ministry, which sent it back to the West Bengal Assembly on 6 June 2013, stating that <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>has</b> penal provisions implemented with retrospective effect, thus contravening the Basic structure doctrine of the Indian constitution and the established criminal law jurisprudence. On 12 December 2013, the West Bengal Legislative Assembly passed an amended version of the original Bill, incorporating changes suggested by the financial services, and revenue and economic affairs departments in New Delhi. The new Bill was then sent for presidential approval.|$|E
25|$|Filipinos {{have fought}} {{as members of}} the American armed forces for over a century. Originally this was limited to U.S. nationals, Filipinos that had emigrated to the U.S. Under a special {{provision}} of the Base Agreement between the U.S. and the Republic of the Philippines, which allowed the U.S. to build bases and station troops in the host country, Filipino nationals are allowed to enlist in the U.S. armed forces. This arrangement is unique, under normal circumstances foreign nationals are not allowed to enlist in U.S. armed forces unless they are resident aliens of the United States. However, since Filipino enlistees are neither U.S. nationals nor resident aliens, they are not granted citizenship upon completion of their first enlistment, and are entitled to fewer benefits. Proponents of the bill often point out that thousands of Filipinos have enlisted so far (including many in the United States Army Forces in the Far East in World War II) and that ninety-percent choose to reenlist, even though they are the only non-citizen veterans that are not given citizenship upon completion of their enlistment. Since <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>has</b> never made it out of committee, it is unknown what arguments might be used against it. The bill is widely supported by the Filipino-American community, as well as a US Conference of Mayors unanimous vote of passage for a resolution authored by Filipino-American Mayor Christopher Cabaldon that called for the full support of the Filipino Veterans Fairness Act. Most versions have been introduced by congressmen with Filipino-American communities among their constituents.|$|E
