50|$|The Chilean jack {{mackerel}} (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi)</b> {{sometimes called the}} Inca scad, is a species of {{jack mackerel}} in the genus Trachurus of the family Carangidae. Since the 1970s, it {{has become one of}} the world's more important commercial fish species. High volumes have been harvested, but the fishery may now be in danger of collapsing.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{a number}} of species with mackerel-like {{characteristics}} in the families Carangidae, Hexagrammidae and Gempylidae are {{commonly referred to as}} mackerel. There has been some confusion between the Pacific jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus) and the heavily harvested Chilean jack mackerel (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi).</b> These have been thought at times to be the same species, but are now recognised as separate species.|$|E
40|$|The {{acoustic}} backscatter from {{pressure release}} prolate spheroids and a three-dimensional {{representation of a}} fish swimbladder (Chilean jack mackerel, <b>Trachurus</b> symmetricus <b>murphyi)</b> was calculated using four target strength models (Kirchhoff-approximation, Kirchhoff-ray-mode, finite element solution of the Helmholtz equation, and prolate-spheroid-modal-series). Smoothly varying errors {{were found in the}} Kirchhoff-approximation and Kirchhoff-ray-mode model results when compared to the other models, and provide objective criteria for constraining the use of the KA and KRM models. A generic correction technique is also proposed for the prolate spheroid estimates and tentatively tested on a jack mackerel swimbladder, resulting in improvements to the target strength estimates from the Kirchhoff-approximation and Kirchhoff-ray-mode models...|$|R
40|$|In {{upwelling}} ecosystems, {{there is}} often a crucial intermediate trophic level, occupied by small, plankton-feeding pelagic fish dominated by one or a few schooling species. Their massive populations may vary radically in size under intensive exploitation. We have used decadal-scale time series to explore patterns of interactions between these fish, their prey, and their predators so as to quantify functional roles of small pelagic fish in those ecosystems. Top-down control of zooplankton is detected off South Africa, Ghana, Japan, and in the Black Sea. Conversely, bottom-up control of predators, such as predatory fish and marine birds, is observed in the Benguela, Guinea, and Humboldt currents. Thus small pelagic fish exert a major control on the trophic dynamics of upwelling ecosystems and constitute midtrophic-level "wasp-waist" populations. Ecosystem effects of fishing are addressed by considering potential structural changes at different scales of observation, ranging from individuals, via school dynamics, to food webs. The overall impact is explored using a trophic model (Ecosim) given different types of food web control. Ecosystem dynamics can be entirely different depending on how the food web is controlled (bottom-up, top-down or wasp-waist). The threat of eroding intra-specific diversity is emphasized because it may lead to a long-term decline in the productivity of the pelagic fish resources. School composition is shown to reflect the relative species abundance within the pelagic community and functions as a "school trap" that could maintain a collapsed population in a depleted state for lengthy periods, and affect spatial dynamics such as migrations. As a result, overfishing can alter the abundance, composition, and distribution in pelagic communities, and may induce drastic changes of state. Predation on zooplankton by the jack mackerel (<b>Trachurus</b> symmetricus <b>murphyi)</b> population in the South Pacific provides an example of the alteration of matter fluxes in trophic webs caused by fishery removals. In conclusion, it is doubtful that pelagic fisheries will continue to increase without major disruptions to ecosystems...|$|R
5000|$|The Chilean jack {{mackerel}} (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi),</b> the most intensively harvested mackerel-like species, {{is found in}} the south Pacific from West Australia to the coasts of Chile and Peru. A sister species, the Pacific {{jack mackerel}} (Trachurus symmetricus), {{is found in the}} north Pacific. The Chilean jack mackerel occurs along the coasts in upwelling areas, but also migrates across the open ocean. Its abundance can fluctuate markedly as ocean conditions change, and is particularly affected by the El Niño.|$|E
50|$|The Pacific jack {{mackerel}} (Trachurus symmetricus) (also {{known as the}} Californian {{jack mackerel}} or simply jack mackerel), is an abundant species of pelagic marine fish in the jack family, Carangidae. The species is distributed along the western coast of North America, ranging from Alaska in the north to the Gulf of California in the south, inhabiting both offshore and inshore environments. The Pacific jack mackerel is a moderately large fish, growing to a maximum recorded length of 81 cm, although commonly seen below 55 cm. It is very similar in appearance to other members of its genus, Trachurus, especially <b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi,</b> which was {{once thought to be}} a subspecies of T. symmetricus, and inhabits waters further south. Pacific jack mackerel travel in large schools, ranging up to 600 miles offshore and to depths of 400 m, generally moving through {{the upper part of the}} water column.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} first scientifically {{described}} by William Orville Ayres in 1855 {{based on the}} holotype specimen taken from San Francisco Bay, California. He named the species Caranx symmetricus, correctly identifying {{its relationship to the}} jacks, but incorporating it into what was later found to be the wrong genus. The fish was redescribed in 1944 under a different name, Decapterus polyaspis, from a specimen caught in Oregon, which under the ICZN rules classifies as a junior synonym, and it is therefore discarded. In 1983, C. symmetricus was transferred to Trachurus symmetricus by William N. Eschmeyer and Earl Herald. The species has twice been treated as a subspecies; once as Trachurus picturatus symmetricus (a subspecies of the blue jack mackerel), and the second more commonly used subspecies of Trachurus symmetricus symmetricus. For many years, the latter was accepted as a valid combination, with Trachurus symmetricus murphyi considered to be a southern subspecies population. Mitochondrial DNA analysis has now confirmed these subspecies to be separate species, with T. s. murphyi now simply <b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi,</b> the Inca scad. The divergence time of these two species was deemed relatively recent, at around 250 000 years ago.|$|E

40|$|A {{recently}} developed international fishery for Jack Mackerel (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi)</b> in the South Pacific has instigated {{a need for}} Dutch participation in research into this fish and fishery. A three,year study was therefore commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality and the PFA (Pelagic Freezer trawler Association). Within this study a pilot project for feasibility of stock assessment using acoustic techniques onboard commercial vessels was executed by IMARES and results are presented in this report...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Eight {{microsatellite}} loci {{were developed}} for the jack mackerel (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi),</b> a fish of significant commercial importance in the Southeast Pacific. Genetic variation at these loci was examined in 15 samples from the locality of Talcahuano (Chile). All eight were highly polymorphic, {{with a number of}} alleles per locus ranging from 4 to 22 and an observed heterozygosity from 0. 429 to 1. These markers will be useful to address issues of pop-ulation genetics, ecology, conservation and fisheries man-agement related to that species...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} verify the ability of RADARSAT- 1 images to detect {{mesoscale}} oceanic features and the possible link of these oceanographic patterns with jack mackerel (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi)</b> distribution in the waters off central Chile, a project was developed {{as part of the}} Canada Centre for Remote Sensing Globesar- 2 program. The combined use of simultaneously acquired RADARSAT- 1, AVHRR sea surface temperature (SST), SeaWiFS Chlorophyll a concentration (Chl), TOPEX/ERS altimeter and ERS- 2 scatterometer wind data greatly enhanced SAR imaging capabilities for the detection of oceanic features. Results show that detection of coastal wind-driven upwellings, eddies, frontal boundaries and phytoplankton blooms is possible using SAR imagery, given the proper environmental conditions. Results also suggest that jack mackerel distribution coastal resources is mainly associated with frontal boundaries, upwelling waters and high chlorophyll concentrations detected by the remotely sensing image...|$|E

40|$|The Chilean jack {{mackerel}} <b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi,</b> is a pelagic {{fish from the}} Carangidae family that is distributed in the South Pacific Ocean. Because this species constitutes an important economic resource across the South Pacific and plays an important ecological role in this ecosystem {{there is a growing}} interest in determining its population structure. In this study,we used molecular markers (mitochondrial DNA sequences and microsatellites) from Chilean {{jack mackerel}} samples to investigate its genetic population structure across the South Pacific Ocean. The mitochondrial DNA did not detect a genetic structure in T. murphyi populations in the Pacific Ocean, but revealed very lowhaplotype diversity and a short genealogy history compared to other small-pelagic species. The same general pattern of a lack of genetic structure was found with microsatellite loci; however, a large genetic diversity was revealed with microsatellite markers. The present results did not support the existence of different stock units for T. murphyi across the South Pacific Ocean but a more holistic approach will be necessary to determine an adequate management strategy for this fishery...|$|E
40|$|Pelagic fish {{schools are}} thought to show a general pattern of {{dispersion}} at night and aggregation within schools during the day. This pattern is often accepted as the major rule driving {{most of the other}} physiological, biological and ecological processes. Foraging on mobile prey, for instance, is assumed to be enhanced by schooling behaviour. Current theory assumes then that foraging is only possible for obligatory gregarious predatory fish from dawn to dusk. However, offshore mesopelagic communities perform vertical migrations and are out of reach for most oceanic pelagic predators during the day (with the exception of some apex predators, e. g. swordfish or big-eye tuna). To investigate how fish may overcome this apparent contradiction, we studied the 3 -dimensional spatial strategy of the South Pacific jack mackerel <b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi</b> according to the abiotic and biotic conditions of the habitat. Data came from acoustic surveys performed in central Chile in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Our results show that the jack mackerel distribution was driven by prey during the night when foraging, and related to the hydrology when resting during the day in {{the upper part of the}} oxycline. Fish were more aggregated at night than during the day, probably because jack mackerel cycles of schooling behaviour depend primarily on prey availability. This 'atypical' behaviour could be an adaptation of gregarious pelagic fish to an oceanic ecosystem. Fish schooling behaviour is not necessarily driven directly by the diel cycle; rather, it can be functional and depends on prey availability...|$|E
40|$|Chilean jack {{mackerel}} (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi)</b> {{is a highly}} migratory pelagic species that inhabits the Southern Pacific Ocean, constituting the most important fishery for Chile. This species exhibits an onshore migration during the summer related to coastal food availability, and an offshore migration towards reproductive oceanic areas (beyond Chilean EEZ) in early spring. During the spawning peaks (November) of 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001, {{jack mackerel}} eggs were collected from four systematic surveys using 8 - 10 fishing vessels, deployed in the spawning area (76 - 92 W) off central Chile. Spatial distribution of eggs was modeled by geostatistical techniques. Environmental information including SST, wind, sea level anomalies and chlorophyll-a, as well as SST gradients, turbulence and currents were calculated. Exploratory results suggest a higher egg density related to warmer waters (16 - 19 C), moderate winds (4 - 8 m s- 1) and low currents (< 15 cm s- 1) as well as SST gradients (< 0. 3 C 10 km- 1). Statistical analysis developed {{with the purpose of}} providing evidence of habitat-species association, reveal a significant relationship (p< 0. 05) between egg density and both SST and wind magnitude. The spatial coupling between eggs and environmental data was accomplished by using the spatial Empirical Orthogonal Functions method (EOF), showing that high amplitudes of the first mode were spatially coherent with high density of eggs, warm waters and low magnitudes of wind, suggesting a bio-physical coupling among these variables in the jack mackerel spawning are...|$|E
40|$|Specimens of a {{new species}} of Rhadinorhynchus Lühe, 1911 are {{described}} from the chub mackerel Scomber japonicus (Scombridae) and the Chilean Jack mackerel <b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi</b> (Carangidae) (possibly a subspecies of Trachurus symmetricus) from the Pacific Ocean off the Peruvian coast at the Port of Chicama, La Libertad. Specimens of Rhadinorhynchus oligospinosus n. sp. are somewhat small having 11 – 14 rows of alternating proboscis hooks with 20 – 22 hooks each with posteriormost hooks in a continuous ring. Ventral hooks are robust with prominent roots but dorsal hooks are slender and shorter with discoid roots. Trunk spines are in two zones separated by a non-spiny region. Anterior trunk spines are in 2 – 3 complete circles but posterior spines are only ventral and lateral, and do not extend posterior {{to the level of}} the posterior end of the proboscis receptacle in both sexes. The new species is closest to Rhadinorhynchus seriolae (Yamaguti, 1963) Golvan, 1969 found in Japanese and Australian waters, but not as close to 19 other species found in the same Pacific waters off Australia, Japan, and Vietnam. In R. seriolae, posterior trunk spines extend well past the receptacle in females, among other diagnostic differences. Proboscis hooks of the new species were analyzed for chemical elements using X-ray in conjunction with EDAX (energy-dispersive analysis for X-ray) software; sulfur had a higher concentration at the edge than the middle of cut hooks...|$|E
40|$|Jack {{mackerel}} <b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi</b> (JM) and {{chub mackerel}} Scomber japonicus (CM) are medium size pelagic fish predators and highly exploited resources. Here we investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of JM and CM diet composition using a large dataset of stomach samples collected from 1973 to 2013 along the Peruvian coast. In total 47, 535 stomachs (18, 377 CM and 29, 158 JM) were analysed, of which 23, 570 (12, 476 CM and 11, 094 JM) were non-empty. Results show that both species are opportunistic and present a trophic overlap. However, despite their smaller maximal size, CM consumed more fish than JM. Both diets presented high spatiotemporal variability. Spatially, the shelf break {{appears as a}} strong biogeographical barrier affecting prey species distribution and thus CM and JM diet. Opportunistic foragers are often considered as actual indicators of ecosystem changes; we show here that diet composition of CM and JM reveal ecosystem changes but {{is not always a}} good indicator of changes in prey biomass as prey accessibility and energy content can also play an important role. In addition we found that El Niño events have a surprisingly weak effect on stomach fullness and diet. Finally our results show that the classic paradigm of positive correlation between diversity and temperature is unlikely to occur in the Humboldt Current system where productivity seems to be the main driver. We show how energy content of forage species and the strength of the oxygen minimum zone most likely play an important role prey diversity and accessibility, and thus in fish foraging behaviour...|$|E

40|$|Since the 1970 s, South Pacific jack {{mackerel}} (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi)</b> {{is one of}} the world’s most important commercial exploited fish stock. The peak in the catch was achieved in the 1990 s, after which the catch for all fleets steadily decreased due to strong fishing mortality and potentially unfavourable environmental conditions. An application of the ecosystem and fish population model SEAPODYM was developed for this species in the South Pacific Ocean {{to determine the extent of}} environmental and fisheries drivers on the stock dynamics. We combined publicly available fishing data, acoustic biomass estimates and expert knowledge to optimise fish population dynamics parameters (habitats, movements, natural and fishing mortality). Despite a large proportion of missing catch over the simulation period, the model provides realistic distributions of biomass, a good fit-to-data and is in agreement with the literature. The feeding habitat is predicted to be delineated by water temperature between 15 °C for the first cohorts and 8. 5 °C for the oldest and dissolved oxygen concentration above 1. 8 ml/L. Optimal spawning temperature is estimated to 15. 57 °C (S. E. : 0. 75 °C). The core habitat is predicted off Central Chile which is also the main fishing ground. There are other areas of higher fish concentration east of New Zealand, in the eastern part of the southern convergence and off Peru and northern Chile. However, there is a clear continuity between these different large sub-populations. Fishing is predicted to have by far the highest impact, a result that should be reinforced if all fishing mortality could be included...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The diet of jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) off southern-central Chile is {{described}} to examine potential biases in {{the determination of}} their main prey. Specimens were collected from catches using different fishing gear (jigging, trawl and purse-seine), from July 2003 to January 2004, and from December 2005 to October 2006. The stomach contents were analyzed in terms of frequency of occurrence, number, and weight of prey items and the diet composition was analyzed using Detrended Correspon-dence Analysis. In the industrial purse-seine fleet for jack mackerel (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi),</b> the dominant prey of D. gigas was T. murphyi. In the industrial mid-trawl fishery for Patagonian grenadier (Macruronus magellanicus), the dominant species in the diet of D. gigas was M. magell-anicus. Similarly, Chilean hake (Merluccius gayi) was the main prey in the diet of D. gigas obtained in the industrial trawl fishery for Chilean hake; and, in both artisanal fish-eries (purse-seine for small pelagics and jigging), small pelagic fish and D. gigas were the main prey in the stomach contents of D. gigas. Cannibalism in D. gigas varied between different fleets and probably is related to stress behavior during fishing. The Detrended Correspondence Analysis ordination showed that the main prey in the diet of D. gigas {{is associated with the}} target species of the respective fishery. Consequently, biases are associated with fishing gear, leading to an overestimate in the occurrence of the target species in the diet. We recommend analyzing samples from jigging taken {{at the same time and}} place where the trawl and purse-seine fleets are operating to avoid this problem, and the application of new tools like stable isotope, heavy metal, and fatty acid signature analyses...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{information on}} various macro environmental variables available since 1876 for the Southeast Pacific and more recent data on Jack mackerel <b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi</b> (Nichols, 1920) landings and biomass in the Peruvian sea, relating them to probable areas of water masses equivalent to Cold Coastal Waters (CCW) and Subtropical Surface Waters (SSW). It is {{concluded that the}} index of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) presents expressions of variability {{that are consistent with}} those found for the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and that the detected changes in biomass of Jack mackerel T. murphyiin the Peruvian sea reflect changes in the availability of the fish stock associated with secular (SOI) and decadal (PDO) variability patterns. These fluctuations in stock availability impact fisheries in Ecuador, Peru and northern Chile, which show significant variations in their landings and would have given a biased picture of the state of abundance, leading to wrong diagnoses of the real situation of the exploited stocks. These patterns of variability would also affect the appearance of El Niño, making them start in the southern hemisphere autumn or spring depending on whether the current PDO is positive or negative. Periods of high (1876 – 1925 and 1976 – 2012) and low (1926 – 1975) variability are also identified in relation to the Euclidean distance of the variances of the SOI; and in relation to the PDO a distinction is made between warm (1925 – 1944 and 1975 – 1994), cold (1945 – 1974) and tempered or interface periods (1895 – 1924 and 1995 – 2012), the latter being explained by the interaction between periods of high variability...|$|E

40|$|Changes in {{abundance}} {{and distribution of}} anchovy and other species of pelagic fish of the Northern Humboldt Current System (NHCS) are driven by environmental forcing variations in different time and spatial scales between the coastal 'cold' ecosystem and the 'warm' oceanic one. Data to study these fluctuations have come mostly from the fishery to show how anchovy (Engraulis ringens) increases when sardine (Sardinops sagax) declines and vice versa. However, using acoustic data on latitudinal biomass we show that other species as mackerel (Scomber japonicus) and jack mackerel (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi)</b> also follow the same opposed trend, then the fishery data hides the true dimension of the balance of abundance among species. Based on Hovmoller diagrams we scrutinized the changes in interannual latitudinal acoustic biomass, landings and influence of El Nino events from 1966 to 2009 in order to describe: 1) how the anchovy decadal distribution pattern moved from south to north since the 1960 's; 2) how there have been produced concomitant changes in the latitudinal abundance and distribution of other species such as sardine, jack mackerel and mackerel before, during and after El Nino events; and 3) what was the overall effect of the succession of El Nino events on all these pelagic species. We concluded that: a) every El Nino event has {{had an effect on}} the expansion or contraction of pelagic species distribution and abundance, with different latitudinal effects; and b) the El Nino 1997 - 98 did not trigger but accelerated a decline phase on the abundance of sardine, jack mackerel and mackerel by a reduction of their ideal habitat due to an expansion of the coastal ecosystem caused by a shallower location of the upper limit of the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) These findings observed using past data might be taken into consideration for fishery management purposes when considering future scenarios...|$|E
40|$|The diets of long-beaked common {{dolphins}} Delphinus capensis (n= 117), dusky dolphins Lagenorhynchus obscurus (n= 72), Burmeister's porpoises Phocoena spinipinnis (n= 69) {{and offshore}} common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus (n= 22) were determined {{based on the}} analysis of the stomach contents collected from animals landed in ports along the Peruvian central coast and from Marcona, in southern Peru, during 1987 - 1993. The number of prey ingested was obtained by counting the number of fish otoliths and cephalopod mandibles (beaks). Only fish could be identified to species level. Long-beaked common dolphins fed mainly on Peruvian anchovy Engraulis ringens (70. 0 % by number), Panama lightfish Vincigerria lucetia (7. 8 %) and slimtail lanternfish Lampanyctus parvicauda (6. 7 %). Dusky dolphins consumed mainly anchovies (49. 7 %, 16. 8 %), slimtail lanternfish (23. 6 %, 0. 1 %), Inca scad <b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi</b> (17. 1 %, 0 %) and mote sculpin Normanichthys crockeri (0 %, 76. 0 %) off the central Peruvian coast and Marcona, respectively. In the same areas, Burmeister's porpoises fed mainly on anchovy (88. 9 %, 77. 6 %), silverside Odontesthes regia (6. 5 %, 0 %), mote sculpin (0 %, 8. 1 %) and South Pacific hake Merluccius gayi (0. 6 %, 7. 9 %). Offshore common bottlenose dolphins consumed mainly slimtail lanternfish (39. 2 %), barracuda Sphyraena sp. (13. 5 %) and Peruvian pilchard Sardinops sagax (13. 3 %). The diversity indices of the diet and temporal shifts in the main prey suggest an opportunistic feeding strategy for the four cetacean species studied, which take advantage of the locally most available epipelagic and mesopelagic schooling fish. Cluster analysis shows high similarity in their diets, with these four marine top predators being able to optimally exploit the high productivity of the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|South Pacific jack mackerel, <b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi,</b> has an ocean-scale distribution, {{from the}} South American {{coastline}} to New Zealand and Tasmania. This fish, captured by Humans since the Holocene, is nowadays heavily exploited and its population has decreased substantially since the mid- 1990 s. The uncertainty associated to jack mackerel population structure currently hampers management. Several hypotheses {{have been proposed}} from a single population up to several discrete populations. Still no definitive answer was given. Determining how environmental conditions drive jack mackerel distribution can provide insights on its population structure. To do so, here we performed in three steps. First, we used satellite data to develop a statistical model of jack mackerel horizontal habitat suitability. Model predictions based on interaction between temperature and chlorophyll-a match the observed jack mackerel distribution, even during extreme El Niño event. Second, we studied the impact of oxygen and show that jack mackerel distribution and abundance is correlated to oxygen over {{a wide variety of}} scales and avoid low oxygen areas and periods. Third, {{on the basis of the}} above we built a conceptual 3 D model of jack mackerel habitat in the Southeastern Pacific. We reveal the presence of a low suitable habitat along the Chilean and Peruvian coast, figuratively presenting a closed door caused by a gap in the horizontal habitat at ∼ 19 – 22 °S and a shallow oxycline off south-centre Peru. This kind of situation likely occurs on a seasonal basis, in austral summer but also at longer temporal scales. A lack of exchanges at some periods/seasons partially isolate jack mackerel distributed off Peru. On the other hand the continuity in the habitat during most of the year explains why exchanges occur. We conclude that the more likely population structure for jack mackerel is a pelagic metapopulation...|$|E
40|$|This work {{provides}} {{a contribution to}} a better understanding of the trophic ecology of important predators in the Northern Humboldt Current System, the jack mackerel (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi),</b> the chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) and the jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) by the characterization of the highly variable feeding patterns of these species at different spatiotemporal scales. We provided new knowledge on the comparative trophic behaviour of these species, defined as opportunistic in previous investigations. For that purpose we applied a variety of statistical methods to an extensive dataset of 27, 188 non-empty stomachs. We defined the spatial organization of the forage fauna of these predators and documented changes in prey composition according to predators’ size and spatiotemporal features of environment. Our results highligh the key role played by the dissolved oxygen. We also deciphered an important paradox on the jumbo squid diet: why do they hardly forage on the huge anchovy (Engraulis ringens) biomass distributed of coastal Peru? We showed that the shallow oxygen minimum zone present off coastal Peru could hamper the co-occurrence of jumbo squids and anchovies. In addition, we proposed a conceptual model on jumbo squid trophic ecology including the ontogenetic cycle, oxygen and prey availability. Moreover we showed that the trophic behaviour of jack mackerel and chub mackerel is adapted to forage on more accessible species such as for example the squat lobster Pleurocondes monodon and Zoea larvae. Besides, both predators present a trophic overlap. But jack mackerel was not as oracious as chub mackerel, contradictorily to what was observed by others authors. Fish diet presented a high spatiotemporal variability, and the shelf break appeared as a strong biogeographical frontier. Diet composition of our fish predators was not necessarily a consistent indicator of changes in prey biomass. El Niño events had a weak effect on the stomach fullness and diet composition of chub mackerel and jack mackerel. Moreover, decadal changes in diet diversity challenged the classic paradigm of positive correlation between species richness and temperature. Finally, the global patterns that we described in this work, illustrated the opportunistic foraging behaviour, life strategies and the high degree of plasticity of these species. Such behaviour allows adaptation to changes in the environment. Tesis (PhD.). [...] Université Montpellier. Spécialité : Biologie des populations et écologi...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The {{mesoscale}} sea-surface circulation pattern within 400 km off Chile {{and between}} 18 °S and 40 °S latitude is described using chlorophyll and temperature {{images from the}} Coastal Zone Color Scanner NIMBUS- 7 satellite. The data base {{is a set of}} four mosaics developed from band- 3 (550 nm) images taken on June 4 and September 16, 1979 and January 14 and April 7, 1980, supplemented with one mosaic of sea-surface temperature distribution for the September mosaic, orbit 4526. Coastal eddies, upwelling zones and zones of onshore-offshore transport are clearly distinguished because a zone of low-pigment concentration water generally separates the highly pigmented near-shore upwelling zones from oceanic waters with pigment concentration in mid-range. The cause of the low-pigment water adjacent to upwelling zones is not known, but the absence of temperature differences between up-welled and low-pigmented water suggest a biological cause. Onshore jets of oceanic waters are traced from distances up to 300 km offshore to within, in places, a few tens of kilometers of the shoreline; width of the jets is of the order of 60 km. In general, these onshore jets are separated by plumes of near-shore surface water moving seaward, with plumes width on the order of 40 km also extending as far as 400 km offshore. Large eddies form off the leading edges of both onshore and offshore plumes, giving rise to a formation called a "hammerhead" structure. Onshore jets are consistent with the result of Inostroza (1972) which documents intrusions of warm oceanic surface waters as semi-stationary features off Coquimbo (30 °S) and off Talcahuano (37 °S). Lack of wind data for 1979 - 80 prevents a direct correlation of onshore-offshore plumes with regional wind stress data. Low level wind charts for the 1979 - 80 period are too coarse in resolution to yield correlations. However, stick diagrams were prepared from coastal wind station data for 1977. Both time and space variations in surface winds could be responsible for the patterns revealed in chlorophyll images. The existence of persistent but probably episodic onshore-offshore transport of surface waters to such large distances offshore have not been reported previously for Chilean waters. These must certainly impact directly the patterns of migrations of populations of major fishery resources such as the Jack Mackerel (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi,</b> common name Jurel, species...|$|E
40|$|The {{study on}} Hydrography and Jack Mackerel stock (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi)</b> in the South Pacific is {{currently}} one year underway. The main achievement consisted of collecting detailed datasets on Chilean, Peruvian and European fisheries activities {{and information on}} the hydrographical / biochemical and environmental conditions present in the South Pacific. The hydrographical and environmental datasets {{are based on the}} analyses of available acoustic information collected on-board survey and fishing vessels and satellite imagery data. Jack Mackerel habitat models are being developed based on these datasets. These models will be used to produce maps of the potential habitat of Jack Mackerel, on the basis of which different stock structure hypotheses will be tested. The models developed so far are able to accurately represent the distribution of Jack Mackerel as observed by fishing and surveying activities, although some additional investigations are needed to improve the statistical fits. Good fits with hydrographical conditions have been found. The models are not yet ready to be used for testing stock structure hypotheses, but this should be the case in the near future. During {{the first year of the}} project, an extensive literature review on Jack Mackerel has also been conducted, and a synthesis has been written, giving an overview on the species biology, ecology and stock structure. The literature suggests that a meta-population structure can be seen as a potential stock structure hypothesis. The literature review also contributed to identify environmental variables that should be crucial to define the suitable habitat of Jack Mackerel. Previously published results indicate, among others, temperature and dissolved oxygen ranges in which Jack Mackerel is able to survive. Finally, a framework to derive reference points for Jack Mackerel, assuming the single stock structure as used within the SPRFMO assessment, has been developed and made available to the SPRFMO Science Committee for review. Analyses of the assessment results within this framework indicate that the fishing mortality corresponding to maximum sustainable yield might be at around 0. 15 per year with a corresponding spawning stock biomass of around 10 million tonnes. Different harvest control rules have been evaluated and show little risk to overexploitation in the medium and long term, although these result heavily rely on strong incoming year classes. The tools to evaluate sustainable management options for the Jack Mackerel population, when a stock structure other than a single one is assumed, are currently under development. The design of scenarios to be tested depend on the results of the habitat modelling exercises. Therefore, preliminary results will only become available early 2014...|$|E
40|$|En: M. R. Hasan and M. Halwart (eds). Fish as feed inputs for aquaculture: practices, {{sustainability}} and implications. FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Technical Paper. No. 518. Rome, FAO. The main aim of {{this report}} is to review the status of and future trends in Chilean small pelagic fisheries. The report discusses the implication of using small pelagic fish species for direct human consumption and as the main protein ingredient in aquafeeds for the sustainable development of the Chilean fisheries and aquaculture industries. The fisheries sector represents an important industry in Chile, and its contribution to both the national economy and global supplies is significant. However, future development will require an increased emphasis on the sustainable use of natural resources. Chile is making concerted efforts to regulate all fishing activity and has given special priority to ensuring the sustainable development of this industry. The total Chilean fishery landing in 2006 was around 4. 9 million tonnes, which represents {{a significant decrease in}} comparison with the previous year and a volume that is 5 percent lower than the average for the period 2001 – 2005. This volume originates from two main sources: the capture fisheries sector, with 4. 08 million tonnes and the aquaculture sector, with an estimated production of around 822. 7 thousand tonnes. In 2006, 61 percent of the capture fisheries sector was contributed by pelagic resources, a figure that is slightly less than the value reported for the previous year. Trends in Chilean fishery and aquaculture production over the last ten years reveal the increasing importance of the aquaculture sector. With the increase in aquaculture production, the use of fishmeal and fish oil in aquafeeds has increased significantly in Chile. The main pelagic species used for the production of fishmeal and fish oil, and the most important pelagic resources in Chile, are the Inca scad or Chilean jack mackerel (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>murphyi),</b> the anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) and two sardines (the South American pilchard, Sardinops sagax, and the Araucarian herring or common sardine, Strangomera bentincki), which contributed 45, 30 and 13 percent of the total accumulated landings for 2006, respectively. However, marked reduction in the captures of these species has been constant. The main species destined for the production of fishmeal and fish oil come from the industrial and artisanal pelagic fisheries. Anchoveta contributes 41 percent of the total fishmeal production, followed by jack mackerel with 27 percent; trash fish/low-value fish represent 15 percent, while other species contribute only 3. 3 percent. In the last decade, the fishmeal production declined by almost 50 percent because of the substantial decrease in landings from these fisheries. In 2005, 1. 78 million tonnes of processed fishery products were produced. Fishmeal and fish oil represented around half of the products processed, followed by frozen products, with a 27 percent share, while fresh chilled and canned products together comprised 17 percent. From {{the second half of the}} decade 1995 – 2005, the production of fishmeal from overall pelagic fish landings was more or less constant, averaging 21 percent; however, canned product production from the same species increased slightly, rising from 2. 1 to 2. 8 percent. This means that the increased production of canned products from pelagic fish is directly correlated with the reduction in fishmeal production. Of the total fishmeal produced in Chile, approximately 40 percent (340 thousand tonnes) is used for domestic consumption. Given that Chilean aquafeed production is on the order of 850 thousand tonnes, the inclusion of fishmeal in these feeds is around 240 thousand tonnes. The limited availability of fishmeal, unstable prices and a principle of economic and environmental sustainability has driven the aquaculture industry to look for alternative protein sources. Consequently, the reduction in fishmeal inclusion levels seen over the last few years has been substantial, a great portion of the fishmeal component in aquafeeds having been replaced by different plant and animal protein substitutes. Fishmeal substitution in the Chilean aquafeed industry was initiated around ten years ago as a direct result of the reduction in capture volumes of small pelagic species. During the last decade, the capture fisheries sector has been characterized by a remarkable reduction in the labour force. Two of the main causes of this diminution are a reduction in the fishing fleet and an increased efficiency of processing plants. A sustained Status and trends on the use of small pelagic fish species in Chile 291 increase in the labour force in the aquaculture sector might compensate for the reduced employment in the capture fisheries sector. The salmon aquaculture industry is one of the most important employment generators in many areas of Chile, where poverty levels are much lower than the national average. The employment generated by this rising industry has a positive impact on poverty indicators for rural communities. The hypothetical scenario of redirecting the use of jack mackerel from fishmeal production to the production of food for direct human consumption might have a positive effect. However, from the point of view of increased food security and poverty alleviation, the impact of the alternative use of this resource for human consumption might not be very significant, given that its products are not in high demand and would be mainly destined for export. Lowering the production of fishmeal will not have a negative impact on national salmon aquaculture, considering that at the present levels of fishmeal inclusion in salmonid aquafeeds there is still a surplus of fishmeal that is generally destined for export. Still, there could be a socio-economic benefit resulting from increased employment though greater processing opportunities...|$|E
