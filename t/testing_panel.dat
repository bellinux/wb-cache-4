2500|$|The {{magnitude}} and capacity {{of these systems}} makes the Ames Arc Jet Complex unique in the world. The largest power supply can deliver 75 megawatts (MW) for a 30-minute duration or 150 MW for a 15-second duration. This power capacity, in combination with a high-volume 5-stage steam ejector vacuum-pumping system, enables facility operations to match high-altitude atmospheric flight conditions with samples of relatively large size. The Thermo-Physics Facilities Branch operates four arc jet facilities. The Interaction Heating Facility (IHF), with an available power of over 60-MW, {{is one of the}} highest-power arc jets available. It is a very flexible facility, capable of long run times of up to one hour, and able to test large samples in both a stagnation and flat plate configuration. The Panel Test Facility (PTF) uses a unique semielliptic nozzle for <b>testing</b> <b>panel</b> sections. Powered by a 20-MW arc heater, the PTF can perform tests on samples for up to 20 minutes. The Turbulent Flow Duct provides supersonic, turbulent high temperature air flows over flat surfaces. The TFD is powered by a 20-MW Hüls arc heater and can test samples [...] in size. The Aerodynamic Heating Facility (AHF) has similar characteristics to the IHF arc heater, offering a wide range of operating conditions, samples sizes and extended test times. A cold-air-mixing plenum allows for simulations of ascent or high-speed flight conditions. Catalycity studies using air or nitrogen can be performed in this flexible rig. A 5-arm model support system allows the user to maximize testing efficiency. The AHF can be configured with either a Hüls or segmented arc heater, up to 20-MW. 1 MW is enough power to supply 750 homes.|$|E

50|$|AGARD-B is a {{standard}} wind tunnel model (calibration model) {{that is used to}} verify, by comparison of test results with previously published data, the measurement chain in a wind tunnel.Together with its derivative AGARD-C it belongs to a family of AGARD standard wind tunnel models. Its origin dates to the year 1952, and the Second Meeting of the AGARD Wind Tunnel and Model <b>Testing</b> <b>Panel</b> in Rome, Italy, when it was decided to define two standard wind tunnel model configurations (AGARD-A and AGARD-B) to be used for exchange of test data and comparison of test results of same models tested in different wind tunnels. The idea was to establish standards of comparison between wind tunnels and improve the validity of wind tunnel tests. Among the standard wind tunnel models, AGARD model configuration B (AGARD-B) has become by far the most popular. Initially intended for the supersonic wind tunnels, the AGARD-B configuration has since been tested in many wind tunnels at a wide range of Mach numbers, from low subsonic (Mach 0.1), through transonic (Mach 0.7 to 1.4) to hypersonic (Mach 8 and above). Therefore, a considerable database of test results is available.|$|E

Stuart Station (JMSS 4) during the burner retrofit outage in November 1991. The <b>test</b> <b>panel</b> consisted of four sections of commercial coatings separated by bare SA 213 -T 2 tubing. During the retrofit outage, a UT survey was performed to document the baseline wall thicknesses of the <b>test</b> <b>panel,</b> {{as well as several}} furnace wall areas outside the <b>test</b> <b>panel.</b> The purpose of the UT survey was to generate the baseline data so that the corrosion wastage associated with the operation of Low NO{sub x} Cell Burners (LNCB{trademark} burner) could be quantitatively determined. The corrosion <b>test</b> <b>panel</b> in JMSS 4 was examined in April 1993 after the first 15 -month operation of the LNCB{trademark} burners. Details of the corrosion analysis and UT data were documented in the Long-Term Testing Report. The second JMSS 4 outage following the LNCB{trademark} burner retrofit took place in September 1944. Up to this point, the <b>test</b> <b>panel</b> in JMSS 4 had been exposed to the corrosive combustion environment for approximately 31 months under normal boiler operation of JMSS 4. This test period excluded the down time for the April 1993 outage.
