40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the findings of}} thermal comfort assessment at Malaysian automotive industry. Nine critical workstations were chosen as subjects for the study {{in order to determine}} the thermal comfort among workers at Malaysian automotive industry. The human subjects for the study comprises of the operators from tire receiving, dashboard assembly, drum <b>tester,</b> <b>body</b> assembly, seat assembly, door check assembly, stamping workstation, engine sub assembly and paint shop of the factory. The environmental factors such as Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), relative humidity, air velocity, illuminance were measured using BABUC A apparatus and Thermal Comfort Measurement equipment. Through questionnaire survey, the demographic data of subjects and their perceptions on thermal comfort at each workstation were assessed based on ISO Standard 7730 and thermal sensation scale using Predicted Mean Vote (PMV). Then, Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) is used to estimate the thermal satisfaction of occupants. The results indicated that most of the workstations of the automotive industry are considered as uncomfortable. Tire receiving station is considered having better working environment compared to other stations with lowest PMV index of 1. 09 to 1. 41 and PPD of 46 %. Meanwhile, the engine sub assembly station and paint shop of assembly are considered the worst thermal environment with the PMV index values ranging between 2. 1 to 2. 9 and PPD values of 81 % to 99 %. Therefore, these two workstations are considered not comfortable because the thermal sensation scale is warm and almost hot...|$|E

Aims of the present work were: i) the acquisition of field load spectra on instrumented skirolls; ii) the fatigue life prediction of modern skirolls after constant amplitude fatigue testing; iii) the structural optimisation of the skirolls and the redesign for a target mission. Two pairs of traditional aluminium skirolls were strain gauged {{in order to measure}} the bending actions in the vertical and horizontal planes: two full bridge measured the vertical plane bending at two different locations, whereas two half bridges applied at the two wheel supports measured the lateral loads. A rugged data acquisition system was used to record several sessions of classical and skating technique on four elite and amateur athletes. The system allowed to measure the instantaneous load values and positions during the push phases: typical load patterns were obtained and peak values were normalised to the <b>testers</b> <b>body</b> weight giving 125 % B. W. in the classical technique and 137 % B. W. in the skating technique. Field load spectra were collected during typical ski sessions and compared with fatigue test data from a fatigue test bench at DolomitiCert laboratory. The knowledge of in field load spectra and the skiroll fatigue curves allowed to perform the fatigue life prediction of the existing skirolls and to compare it with a target mission. A solid model of each skiroll was reconstructed with ProE® and FEM analysed with Ansys®. The finite elements model was validated comparing the results of the simulation with the laboratory tests. A new optimised profile of the skiroll was developed {{in order to get a}} uniform permissible bending stress. With this new profile the fatigue life increased of 20 times with a mass increment of only 6 % per skiroll...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} testing of baseball bats for potential use in regulating bat performance is best completed {{using the same}} baseballs as are used in a game. In the current research, the effects of repeated use of baseballs in testing are explored. The batball performance is compared with ball performance off a rigid wall, and the consistency of both bat- and ball-performance metrics during bat-ball testing. The understanding of these conditions gives bat <b>testers</b> and regulatory <b>bodies</b> a basis for what test criteria to consider {{in the development of}} baseball bat test protocols...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve the {{mechanical}} and thermal resilient properties of mild steel, Zn-ZrO 2 -SiC composite coating was fabricated from zinc-based sulphate electrolyte with incorporated composite particles of ZrO 2 /SiC at 2. 0 A/cm 2 for 10 min. The effects of particle on the mechanical properties were examined using scanning electron microscope attached with energy dispersion spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. The micro-hardness and wear resistance behaviour were determined with high diamond microhardness <b>tester</b> and three <b>body</b> abrasive MTR- 300 testers with dry sand rubber wheel apparatus with 5 N. The fabricated coating was thermally heated at 200 °C for 4 h to evaluate the coating stability. From the results, a modification in the microstructure and topographic orientation {{as a result of}} incorporated composite was noticed on the zinc matrix. The mechanical and thermal properties were observed to be considerably improved by the incorporation of the ZrO 2 /SiC weight fraction. A significant improvement in wear and hardness properties were also obtained for the multiphase embedded coating...|$|R
40|$|A {{wide range}} of metal-oxides exhibit {{fascinating}} properties and multiple functionalities that could address challenge of physical and mechanical deterioration of materials in service. In this study, Zn-ZrO 2, Zn-SiC and Zn-ZrO 2 -SiC composite coating was fabricated from zinc based sulphate electrolyte at constant current density, depth of immersion, distance between anode and cathode with time of deposition. The effect of particle on the physical behaviour of the coating was examined by coating gauge tester for the coating thickness and coating texture. The mechanical properties in term of hardness and wear characteristics were examined using high diamond micro-hardness <b>tester</b> and three <b>body</b> abrasive MTR- 300 testers with dry sand rubber wheel apparatus with 5 N and 15 N, respectively. The coating stability in harsh region was examined with isothermal furnace at 200 oC for 4 h. The structural behaviour was investigated using scanning electron microscope attached with energy dispersion spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). The result shows that significant improvements in wear and hardness properties {{are linked to the}} microstructural modification of the coating {{as a result of the}} embedded particulate. The strengthening behaviour was improved with about 98 % of coating efficiency. The progression of the coating thickness and texture were in line with other results obtained...|$|R
