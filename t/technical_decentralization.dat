The art and the thought of Cage were a response to the growing complexity of the world through a practice and a reflection that focuses heavily on the concept of emptiness, understood as <b>technical</b> <b>decentralization</b> of: the author of the musical structure and the individual and of the same identification of sounds. This complexity results from a network of independent nodes, subjects, activities and institutions that interact in no particular order. You can no longer assume the existence of an ultimate subject for whose wisdom assumes all sense. There is no longer any author. Events happen randomly. Relinquishing control {{is one of the main}} themes running through the compositional work of Cage...|$|E

Section 1 focuses on the institutional and organizational structure of the service providers {{by looking at the}} level of <b>technical</b> and managerial <b>decentralization</b> reached in the four cities (Calcutta, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai) Section 2 focuses on the question of property rights and the debate on usage conflicts in order to fill the gap for the future demand. Section 3 revisits the question of reforms that were launched in the 1990 s for all infrastructure sectors. Section 4 and 5 concentrate on two directions the sector could look at for changes: the development of conservation based strategy and the need for a more participative approach by involving the civil society. This would mean a paradigm shift for the sector. Indeed, demand side solutions are rarely considered and the problem of water supply is mostly addressed by the supply angle.
