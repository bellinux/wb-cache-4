5|$|In some cases, <b>travelers</b> <b>and</b> the {{aircraft}} can clear customs and immigration at the departure airport. As {{one example of}} this, are airports in Canada with United States border preclearance facilities. This allows flights from those airports to fly into US airports {{that do not have}} customs and immigration facilities. Luggage from such flights can also be transferred to a final destination in the U.S. through the airport of entry.|$|E
5|$|This highway {{has been}} {{associated}} with emperors Chandragupta Maurya and Sher Shah Suri, the latter became synonymous with this route due to his role in ensuring the safety of the <b>travelers</b> <b>and</b> the upkeep of the road. Emperor Sher Shah widened and realigned the road to other routes, and provided approximately 1700 roadside inns through his empire. These inns provided free food and lodgings to the travelers regardless of their status.|$|E

5|$|During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Egyptian pagan {{culture was}} in decline after {{the rise of}} Christianity and later Islam, but {{interest}} in Egyptian antiquity continued {{in the writings of}} medieval scholars such as Dhul-Nun al-Misri and al-Maqrizi. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, European <b>travelers</b> <b>and</b> tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys, leading to a wave of Egyptomania across Europe. This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt, who took, purchased, or were given many important antiquities.|$|E
5|$|June 12, 1899, {{was the day}} of the Gollmar Brothers Circus, {{which drew}} {{hundreds}} of visitors in addition to the town's 1,800 inhabitants. Around 3:00p.m., clouds began to build, and the sky became quite dark. As the circus ended for the day around 4:30 PM, a heavy rain, with some hail, began to fall. The rain let up around 5:00 PM, and people began to head home for the day. By 6:00 PM, the streets of New Richmond were full of tourists, <b>travelers</b> <b>and</b> residents.|$|E
5|$|Kubera is the {{treasurer}} of the gods and overlord of the semi-divine Yakshas, the Guhyakas, Kinnaras and Gandharvas, who act as his assistants and protectors of the jewels of the earth, as well as guardians of his city. Kubera is also the guardian of <b>travelers</b> <b>and</b> the giver of wealth to individuals, who please him. The Rakshasas also serve Kubera, however, some cannibalistic Rakshasas are described to have sided with Ravana {{in the battle against}} Kubera. Kubera also developed as minor marriage-divinity. He is invoked with Shiva at weddings and is described as Kameshvara ("Lord of Kama – pleasure, desire etc."). He is associated with fertility of the aquatic type.|$|E

5|$|Saladin went to Alexandria in 1171–72 {{and found}} himself facing the dilemma of having many {{supporters}} in the city, but little money. A family council was held there by the Ayyubid emirs of Egypt where {{it was decided that}} al-Muzaffar Taqi al-Din Umar, Saladin's nephew, would launch an expedition against the coastal region of Barqa (Cyrenaica) west of Egypt with a force of 500 cavalry. In order to justify the raid, a letter was sent to the Bedouin tribes of Barqa, rebuking them for their robberies of <b>travelers</b> <b>and</b> ordering them to pay the alms-tax (zakat). The latter was to be collected from their livestock.|$|E
5|$|The Chickasaw Turnpike takes a southwest-to-northeast route, {{passing through}} only two counties, Murray and Pontotoc. The turnpike begins in Murray County at U.S. Highway177 (US-177) north of Sulphur; west of this interchange, the road becomes State Highway 7 Spur (SH-7 Spur). The turnpike {{continues}} northeast into Pontotoc County. Just {{north of the}} county line is a barrier toll plaza, the only plaza along the route. Beyond the tollbooth lies an interchange serving the town of Roff. This is a partial interchange, providing access to Roff for eastbound <b>travelers</b> <b>and</b> access to the westbound lanes from Roff. The Chickasaw Turnpike then ends at SH-1.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} {{preventable}} with the polio vaccine; however, {{a number of}} doses are required {{for it to be}} effective. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends polio vaccination boosters for <b>travelers</b> <b>and</b> those who live in countries where the disease is occurring. Once infected there is no specific treatment. In 2016, polio affected 42 people, while there were about 350,000 cases in 1988. In 2014 the disease was only spreading between people in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In 2015 Nigeria had stopped the spread of wild poliovirus but it reoccurred in 2016.|$|E

5|$|The {{sight of}} {{elephants}} executing captives both horrified and attracted {{the interest of}} European <b>travelers,</b> <b>and</b> was recorded in numerous contemporary journals and accounts of life in Asia. The practice was eventually suppressed by the European empires that colonised {{the region in the}} 18th and 19th centuries. While primarily confined to Asia, the practice was occasionally adopted by Western powers, such as Ancient Rome and Carthage, particularly to deal with mutinous soldiers.|$|E
5|$|From 7 January 2001, NSB {{made several}} major {{changes to the}} {{commuter}} rail. A fixed, hourly headway was introduced on the trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim; including extra rush-hour trains from Lerkendal to Stjørdal, giving 23 departures per day in each direction. South of Trondheim, the service was rerouted to terminate at Lerkendal. Six stations were closed: Muruvik, Solbakken, Mære, Østborg, Rinnan and Elberg. At the same time, the station at Marienborg and Røstad opened. NSB also introduced a fare zone system, which gave up to NOK20 discount for single-fare <b>travelers</b> <b>and</b> about the same fares for month-pass holders. Part {{of the reason for}} the expansion was that the delivery of the new Class 93 trains for regional services freed up more Class 92 units. This also allowed NSB to operate some of services with double unit (four-car) trains in rush-hour.|$|E
5|$|In {{return for}} iqtaʿat, annual {{customary}} payments, and honorary titles and robes, the amir al-ʿarab {{was expected to}} command his horsemen as auxiliaries in the wars against the Mongols, the Crusaders, their allies and rebellious Mamluk emirs. Another expectation of the amir al-ʿarab and the lower-ranking tribal chieftains was intelligence gathering regarding enemy movements near the frontier. Among the official duties of the amir al-ʿarab and the Syrian Bedouin tribes was {{the defense of the}} sultanate's boundaries, and maintenance and oversight of the roads, bridges and mountain passes of the desert and within their iqtaʿat. This also entailed the protection of merchant <b>travelers</b> <b>and</b> the annual Hajj pilgrim caravan, which traversed Bedouin territory to reach the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina in the Hejaz. Tribesmen also served as desert guides for the army and state officials. The amir al-ʿarab was further responsible for collecting zakat (dues) on the livestock of the Bedouin tribes.|$|E

5|$|Palmyra {{was visited}} by {{travelers}} such as Pietro Della Valle (between 1616 and 1625), Jean-Baptiste Tavernier (in 1638) and many Swedish and German explorers. In 1678 {{a group of}} English merchants visited the city, and its first scholarly description appeared in a 1696 book by Abednego Seller. In 1751, an expedition led by Robert Wood and James Dawkins studied Palmyra's architecture. French artist and architect Louis-François Cassas conducted an extensive survey of the city’s monuments in 1785, publishing over a hundred drawings of Palmyra’s civic buildings and tombs. Visits by <b>travelers</b> <b>and</b> antiquarians continued, including one made by Lady Hester Stanhope in 1813, and another by Lady Strangford in 1862. Palmrya was photographed {{for the first time}} in 1864 by Louis Vignes.|$|E
5|$|Raised by {{a family}} of Southerners in Kansas, Anderson began {{supporting}} himself by stealing and selling horses in 1862. After his father {{was killed by a}} Union loyalist judge, Anderson fled Kansas for Missouri. There he robbed <b>travelers</b> <b>and</b> killed several Union soldiers. In early 1863 he joined Quantrill's Raiders, a pro-Confederate group of guerrillas that operated in Missouri. He became a skilled bushwhacker, earning the trust of the group's leaders, William Quantrill and George M. Todd. Anderson's acts as a guerrilla led the Union to imprison his sisters; after one of them died in custody, Anderson devoted himself to revenge. He took {{a leading role in the}} Lawrence Massacre, and later participated in the Battle of Baxter Springs, both of which occurred in 1863.|$|E
5|$|Since its publication, {{some have}} viewed {{the book with}} skepticism. Some in the Middle Ages {{regarded}} the book simply as a romance or fable, due largely to the sharp difference of its descriptions of a sophisticated civilisation in China to other early accounts by Giovanni da Pian del Carpine and William of Rubruck who portrayed the Mongols as 'barbarians' who appeared to belong to 'some other world'. Doubts have also been raised in later centuries about Marco Polo's narrative of his travels in China, for example for his failure to mention the Great Wall of China, {{and in particular the}} difficulties in identifying many of the place names he used (the great majority however have since been identified). Many have questioned if he had visited the places he mentioned in his itinerary, if he had appropriated the accounts of his father and uncle or other <b>travelers,</b> <b>and</b> some doubted if he even reached China, or that if he did, perhaps never went beyond Khanbaliq (Beijing).|$|E

5|$|The Crusaders recaptured the {{fortress}} on 24 May 1191 {{after a short}} siege commanded by King Richard the Lionheart. Authority over Darum was assigned to Count Henry I of Champagne, but Richard later had {{the fortress}} demolished in July 1193 prior to withdrawing his forces from Ascalon. The Ayyubids rebuilt the fortress soon after {{in order to use}} it as a bridgehead to reconquer territories lost in Palestine during the Third Crusade. Nonetheless, in 1196, Sultan al-Aziz Uthmanbdecided to have it demolished in case of its capture by the Crusaders. According to 15th-century historian al-Maqrizi, this decision resulted in public resentment since <b>travelers</b> <b>and</b> merchants had significantly benefited from the fort's protection. In 1226, Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi visited Darum and noted it was one of the cities of Lot and contained a ruined castle.|$|E
5|$|The first hospices are {{believed}} to have originated in the 11th century, when {{for the first time the}} terminally ill were permitted into places dedicated to treatment by Crusaders. In the early 14th century, the order of the Knights Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem opened the first hospice in Rhodes, meant to provide refuge for <b>travelers</b> <b>and</b> care for the ill and dying. The hospice practice languished until revived in the 17th century in France by the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul and, later, by the Irish Sisters of Charity, who opened St Joseph's Hospice in London, England in 1902. In the 1950s at St. Joseph's, Cicely Saunders developed many of the foundational principles of modern hospice care. She later founded St Christopher's Hospice in London.|$|E
5|$|The many {{achievements}} of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying, surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids, temples, and obelisks; a system of mathematics, a practical and effective system of medicine, irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques, the first known planked boats, Egyptian faience and glass technology, new forms of literature, and the earliest known peace treaty, made with the Hittites. Egypt left a lasting legacy. Its art and architecture were widely copied, and its antiquities carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of <b>travelers</b> <b>and</b> writers for centuries. A new-found respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans and Egyptians led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.|$|E
