5|$|The {{executive}} summary of <b>the</b> <b>TRC</b> {{concluded that the}} assimilation amounted to cultural genocide. The ambiguity of the phrasing allowed for the interpretation that physical and biological genocide also occurred. <b>The</b> <b>TRC</b> was not authorized to conclude that physical and biological genocide occurred, as such a finding would imply a legal responsibility of the Canadian government that {{would be difficult to}} prove. As a result, the debate about whether the Canadian government also committed physical and biological genocide against Indigenous populations remains open.|$|E

5|$|Residential school {{deaths were}} common {{and have been}} linked to the {{persistence}} of poorly constructed and maintained facilities. The actual number of deaths remains unknown due to inconsistent reporting by school officials and the destruction of medical and administrative records in compliance with retention and disposition policies for government records. Research by <b>the</b> <b>TRC</b> revealed that at least 6,000 students had died, mostly from disease.|$|E
40|$|This project aims at {{analysing}} how {{the concepts}} of truth, justice and reconciliation are deployed in post-conflict societies through Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRCs). As {{a part of their}} respective peace agreements {{at the end of their}} civil wars, Sierra Leone and Liberia have each established a <b>TRC</b> with <b>the</b> similar official purposes of uncovering past atrocities and reconciling their populations. Therefore, we conducted a comparative analysis of the Liberian and Sierra Leonean TRCs, which showed that the formations of <b>the</b> <b>TRCs</b> in Liberia and Sierra Leone played out in similar manners. However, <b>the</b> two <b>TRC’s</b> addressed justice in different ways, partially due to the context of other transitional justice mechanisms present in the two countries. Moreover, the project found that the working processes of the commissions did not produce objective truths about past violent conflicts, while reconciliation had different meanings, as seen observed in public hearings held by <b>the</b> <b>TRCs.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> project found that the recommendations of <b>the</b> two <b>TRCs</b> were politicised and contested, which questions the ability of <b>the</b> <b>TRCs</b> to promote reconciliation on a national level. The main finding of the project is that the concept of truth, justice and reconciliation play out differently in the cases of <b>the</b> two <b>TRCs</b> due to their national contexts, although they have similar objectives and were established in two post-conflict societies with similar conflict trajectories...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} {{coordinating}} and stabilizing the two color tone reproduction curves (TRC) of two xerographic printing engines is considered.

5|$|Preservation of {{documentation}} of the legacy of residential schools was also highlighted {{as part of the}} TRC's Calls to Action. Community groups and other stakeholders have variously argued for documenting or destroying evidence and testimony of residential school abuses. On April 4, 2016, the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that documents pertaining to IAP settlements will be destroyed in 15 years if individual claimants do not request to have their documents archived.

5|$|On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper {{offered a}} public apology {{on behalf of}} the Government of Canada and the leaders of the other federal parties in the Canadian House of Commons. Nine days prior, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was {{established}} to uncover the truth about the schools. The commission gathered statements from residential school survivors through public and private meetings at various local, regional and national events across Canada. Seven national events held between 2008 and 2013 commemorated the experience of former students of residential schools. In 2015, <b>the</b> <b>TRC</b> concluded with the establishment of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, and the publication of a multi-volume report detailing the testimonies of survivors and historical documents from the time.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>TRC</b> {{concluded}} {{that it may be}} impossible to ever identify the number of deaths or missing children, {{in part because of the}} habit of burying students in unmarked graves. The work is further complicated by a pattern of poor record keeping by school and government officials, who neglected to keep reliable numbers about the number of children who died or where they were buried. While most schools had cemeteries on site, their location and extent remain difficult to determine as cemeteries that were originally marked were found to have been later razed, intentionally hidden or built over.|$|E

25|$|There {{came to be}} {{problems}} with interpretation of the franchise terms for the City. By 1912, the city limits had extended significantly, with the annexation of communities to the north (1912: North Toronto) and the east (1908: Town of East Toronto) and the west (1909: the City of West Toronto—The Junction). After many attempts to force <b>the</b> <b>TRC</b> to serve these areas, the City created its own street railway operation, the Toronto Civic Railways to do so, and built several routes. Repeated court battles forced <b>the</b> <b>TRC</b> to build new cars, but they were of old design. When <b>the</b> <b>TRC</b> franchise ended in 1921, the Toronto Transportation Commission (TTC) was created, combining the city-operated Toronto Civic Railways lines into its new network.|$|E

Section three will contrast <b>the</b> <b>TRC's</b> course of action - truth in exchange for criminal prosecution - with the traditional notions of justice. This comment will then argue that the Truth Commission did not produce its stated goals of national unity and reconciliation.

25|$|Reports {{about the}} CCB were first {{published}} in 1990 by the now-defunct weekly Vrye Weekblad, and more detailed information emerged later in the 1990s {{at a number of}} TRC amnesty hearings. General Joep Joubert, in his testimony before <b>the</b> <b>TRC,</b> revealed that the CCB was a long-term special forces project in the South African Defence Force.

25|$|Botha {{refused to}} testify at the new government's Truth and Reconciliation Commission for exposing apartheid-era crimes, which was chaired by his {{cultural}} and political nemesis, Archbishop Desmond Tutu. <b>The</b> <b>TRC</b> found that he had ordered {{the bombing of the}} South African Council of Churches headquarters in Johannesburg. In August 1998 he was fined and given a suspended jail sentence for his refusal to testify in relation to human rights violations and the violence sanctioned by the State Security Council (SSC) which he, as president until 1989, had directed.|$|E
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of conflict, the demand for societies to acknowledge the existence and impact of political violence has instigated creative policy developments in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRCs) operate as mediated sites of historical contestation, offering states an opportunity to ‘come to terms’ with their own pasts. Despite the extensive body of scholarship assessing <b>the</b> <b>TRC’s</b> potential in promoting developmental goals, minimal academic {{attention has been given}} to the Report the Commissioners are mandated to produce. This study adopts a critical approach in comparatively examining key sections of the Nigerian and Liberian Commission Reports by using the ‘judgment’ substructure, as part of the ‘Appraisal System’. This thesis argues that the Reports, in summarising the findings of <b>the</b> <b>TRC’s</b> investigations, do not seek to recount objective ‘facts’; rather, project a specific image of the past, framed by the Commissioners’ assessment of how state power should be judged...|$|R

Deale would further have stated that Gert van der Veer, head of SAA, and lawyer Ardie Malherbe were present during the transfer of the tapes.

25|$|In 1861, the City of Toronto (City) {{issued a}} thirty-year transit {{franchise}} (Resolution 14, By-law 353) for a horse-drawn street railway, after the Williams Omnibus Bus Line had become heavily loaded. Alexander Easton's Toronto Street Railway (TSR) opened the first street railway line in Canada on September 11, 1861, operating from Yorkville Town Hall to the St. Lawrence Market. At {{the end of}} the TSR franchise, the City government ran the railway for eight months, but ended up granting a new thirty-year franchise to the Toronto Railway Company (TRC) in 1891. <b>The</b> <b>TRC</b> was the first operator of horseless streetcars in Toronto. The first electric car ran on August 15, 1892, and the last horse car ran on August 31, 1894, to meet franchise requirements.|$|E
25|$|The {{spontaneous}} {{emergence of}} the Gacaca activities and the gradual support for Gacaca by the authorities was clearly motivated {{by the fact that}} the ordinary justice system was virtually non-existent after the genocide. The Gacaca had to do what it did before—relieve the pressure on the ordinary courts. These were now not working slowly, as they did before, but not working at all. Once they started to work, they were quickly overloaded with the cases of genocide suspects who were filling the prisons. This new form of justice was bold, but not unprecedented: This becomes evident when one considers the emerging numbers of Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRC) as, for example, that in South Africa. The slogan of the South African TRC “Revealing is Healing” and its argument that truth-telling serves as a “therapeutic function” underline this assumption. <b>The</b> <b>TRC</b> format was suggested to the Rwandan government, but ultimately they chose to pursue mass justice through Gacaca; a system where their country had roots and familiarity.|$|E

Consequently, other countries have instituted similar commissions, though not always with the same scope or the allowance for charging those currently in power.|$|R

500|$|The fourth {{volume of}} the TRC's final report, {{dedicated}} to missing children and unmarked burials, was developed after the original TRC members realized, in 2007, that the issue required its own working group. In 2009, <b>the</b> <b>TRC</b> requested $1.5million in extra funding {{from the federal government}} to complete this work, but was denied. The researchers concluded, after searching land near schools using satellite imagery and maps, that, [...] "for the most part, the cemeteries that the Commission documented are abandoned, disused, and vulnerable to accidental disturbance".|$|E
500|$|In 2008, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was {{established}} to travel across Canada collecting the testimonies of people affected by the residential school system.
