5|$|Deciding to work together, Bart, Lisa, and Bob {{escape and}} try to save the dam. While Lisa and Bob set about {{defusing}} Cecil's dynamite, Bart jumps at Cecil before he can press the plunger. Cecil attempts to swat him off with the briefcase of money, but the case bursts open and the money is lost. Cecil manages to throw Bart off the cliff, declaring he will kill Bart as Bob never could; ironically, Bob grabs <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> of the dynamite and dives down {{in an effort to}} save him. As the two dangle {{down the side of the}} dam, Bob decides to cut <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> on the dynamite in an act of self-sacrifice to prevent Cecil from destroying the town, but his and Bart's perilous fall is broken by a conveniently placed pipe.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} {{exploding}} cigars were being turned out by manufacturers such as Adams and Appel, the chemical explosive variety {{had fallen out}} of favor. According to Adams, the large-scale switch to a non-chemical device occurred in approximately 1915 {{in the aftermath of a}} death caused by a homemade exploding cigar rigged with dynamite. Though exploding cigars were not normally rigged with dynamite but with explosive caps using a less powerful incendiary, following the incident, a number of U.S. states banned the product altogether. The replacement for chemical explosives was a metal spring mechanism, bound with cord—as the victim puffed away, <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> burned through, causing the device to spring open, thus rupturing the cigar's end.|$|E
5|$|Spinal disc {{herniation}} {{occurs when}} the Intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. Once <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> is compressed, the dog experiences symptoms ranging from mild back/neck pain to leg paralysis, loss of sensation, and urinary and fecal incontinence. The most commonly location seen is the mid-back area, but it may occur anywhere along the spine. Cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, and this can be accompanied by medication for the pain. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
5000|$|SWDs {{should never}} be brushed, instead, as <b>the</b> <b>cords</b> grow they should be checked for matting. When matting does occur they should be gently pulled apart without tearing <b>the</b> <b>cords.</b> If {{there is too much}} matting <b>the</b> <b>cords</b> should be sheared.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Corded</b> Ware was genetically {{strongly}} related to the Yamnaya culture, [...] "documenting a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery," [...] the Eurasiatic steppes. <b>The</b> <b>Corded</b> Ware culture may have disseminated the Proto-Germanic and Proto-Balto-Slavic Indo-European languages. <b>The</b> <b>Corded</b> Ware Culture also shows genetic affinity with the later Sintashta culture, where the proto-Indo-Iranian language may have originated.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Corded</b> Ware {{culture may}} have {{played a central role in}} the spread of the Indo-European {{languages}} in Europe during the Copper and Bronze Ages.

5|$|Also {{commonly}} called spinal disc herniation, {{this is where}} the intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. When <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> is compressed, the dog can experience symptoms ranging in scope from mild back or neck pain to paralysis of limbs, loss of sensation, and loss of bladder or bowel control. It is most commonly seen in the mid-back area, but can occur anywhere along the spine. Mild cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal in a crate to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, which can be accompanied by pain medication. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
5|$|During that night, a storm blew up and {{approximately}} 200 soldiers {{were assigned to}} the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the wind was strong enough to pull some of the iron pickets anchoring the airship out of the ground so that she swung broadside to the wind, causing her to tip on her side, which in turn caused sacks of ballast to be released. Even then the Patrie could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> would have been enough to release the hydrogen and save the ship. An oversight led to this not being done, the troops were unable to keep control her and thus could not continue to hold her down in the storm.|$|E
5|$|The region between Geraldton and Gingin {{is a rich}} one for Abietinae banksias, {{and nine}} species occur there. Despite this, there is little overlap in range and habitat; Banksia scabrella is unusual in its co-occurrence with B. leptophylla. It is also {{associated}} with the endangered heath shrub Leucopogon marginatus. Burma Road Nature Reserve {{is one of the}} few protected conservation areas in its range; there, Banksia scabrella is found most commonly in (and forms a prominent part of) a mallee sedgeland, which is dominated by <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> rush Ecdeiocolea monostachya as a ground cover, and the mallee Eucalyptus eudesmoides as an emergent species. It is found occasionally in acacia scrub-heath, and rarely in acacia thickets and banksia woodland. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is unlikely to contract and may actually grow, depending on how effectively it migrates into newly habitable areas.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Corded</b> Ware {{culture in}} Middle Europe (c. 3200/2,900-2450/2350 cal.

50|$|The myoelastic theory {{states that}} when <b>the</b> vocal <b>cords</b> are brought {{together}} and breath pressure {{is applied to}} them, <b>the</b> <b>cords</b> remain closed until the pressure beneath them—the subglottic pressure—is sufficient to push them apart, allowing air to escape and reducing the pressure enough for the muscle tension recoil to pull the folds back together again. Pressure builds up once again until <b>the</b> <b>cords</b> are pushed apart, and the whole cycle keeps repeating itself. The rate at which <b>the</b> <b>cords</b> open and close—the number of cycles per second—determines the pitch of the phonation.|$|R
50|$|Torsion - This term {{refers to}} the {{twisting}} of the umbilical around itself. Torsion of <b>the</b> umbilical <b>cord</b> is very common (especially in equine stillbirths) {{but it is not}} a natural state of <b>the</b> umbilical <b>cord.</b> <b>The</b> umbilical <b>cord</b> can be untwisted at delivery. <b>The</b> average <b>cord</b> has 3 twists.|$|R
5|$|On {{top of all}} {{the misery}} the Zoroastrians had to pay a heavy {{religious}} tax known as Jizya. Zoroastrian sources record the method of extracting this as designed to humiliate the dhimmi, the taxed person, who was compelled to stand while the officer receiving the money sat on a high throne. Upon receiving the payment, the officer gave the dhimmi a blow on the neck and drove him roughly away. The public was invited to watch the spectacle. Arab tax collectors would mock Zoroastrians for wearing Kushti and would rip it off, hanging <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> around the necks of the beleaguered faithful. Due to corruption of the tax officials, at times twice and even three times the official figure would be collected, because every intermediary had to receive his share. If the families could not afford paying the Jizya, their children were beaten and even tortured and their religious books were thrown in fire. That is how the term “the bookless” came about. Under the woeful conditions, some had to convert and {{there were those who}} declared themselves Muslims, picked up Islamic names, but in secret continued Zoroastrian practices. Today the latter group among the Zoroastrians is known as Jaddid. In response to persecution and segregation policies, the Zoroastrians community became closed, introverted, and static.|$|E
25|$|Umbilical cord {{compression}} {{can result}} from, for example, entanglement of <b>the</b> <b>cord,</b> a knot in <b>the</b> <b>cord,</b> or a nuchal cord, (which is the wrapping of {{the umbilical cord}} around the fetal neck) but these conditions do not always cause obstruction of fetal circulation.|$|E

50|$|On {{the lower}} pitches in the modal register, <b>the</b> vocal <b>cords</b> are thick and wedge-shaped. Because of the thickness, large {{portions}} of the opposing surfaces of <b>the</b> vocal <b>cords</b> are brought into contact, and the glottis remains closed for a considerable time in each cycle. The glottis opens from the bottom first before it opens at the top, which imparts a fluid, wavelike motion to <b>the</b> <b>cords.</b> <b>The</b> modal voice has a broad harmonic spectrum, rich in overtones, because of the rolling motion of <b>the</b> <b>cords.</b> It is comparatively loud to the other vocal registers because of the vibratory energy present, but {{it is capable of}} dynamic variation.|$|R
