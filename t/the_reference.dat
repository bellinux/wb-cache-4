5|$|BLEU’s {{output is}} always a number between 0 and 1. This value {{indicates}} how similar the candidate text is to <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> texts, with values closer to 1 representing more similar texts. Few human translations will attain a score of 1, since this would indicate that the candidate is identical to one of <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> translations. For this reason, {{it is not necessary}} to attain a score of 1. Because there are more opportunities to match, adding additional reference translations will increase the BLEU score.|$|E
5|$|Cylinder working {{pressure}} is specified at a reference temperature, usually 15°C or 20°C. and cylinders {{also have a}} specified maximum safe working temperature, often 65°C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature, as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable {{in terms of the}} standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> temperature does not exceed the specified {{working pressure}} stamped on the cylinder. This allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified working pressure when the filling temperature is greater than <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> temperature, but not more than 65°C, provided that the filling pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that temperature, and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct working pressure when cooled to <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> temperature.|$|E
5000|$|A {{foreign key}} {{is a field}} in a {{relational}} table that matches the primary key column of another table. The foreign key {{can be used to}} cross-reference tables. Foreign keys do not need to have unique values in <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> relation. Foreign keys effectively use the values of attributes in <b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> relation to restrict the domain of one or more attributes in <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> relation.A foreign key could be described formally as: [...] "For all tuples in <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> relation projected over <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> attributes, there must exist a tuple in <b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> relation projected over those same attributes such that the values in each of <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> attributes match <b>the</b> corresponding values in <b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> attributes." ...|$|R
50|$|A table (called <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> table) {{can refer}} to a column (or a group of columns) in another table (<b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> table) by using a foreign key. <b>The</b> <b>referenced</b> column(s) in <b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> table must be under a unique constraint, such as a primary key. Also, self-references are {{possible}} (not fully implemented in MS SQL Server though). On inserting a new row into <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> table, <b>the</b> relational database management system (RDBMS) checks if the entered key value exists in <b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> table. If not, no insert is possible. It is also possible to specify DRI actions on UPDATE and DELETE, such as CASCADE (forwards a change/delete in <b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> table to <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> tables), NO ACTION (if the specific row is <b>referenced,</b> changing <b>the</b> key is not allowed) or SET NULL / SET DEFAULT (a changed/deleted key in <b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> table results in setting <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> values to NULL or to the DEFAULT value if one is specified).|$|R
50|$|Multiple rows in <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> (or child) table may {{refer to}} the same row in <b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> (or parent) table.

5|$|One {{aspect of}} the Carolinian method of {{estimating}} longitude on inter-island sailings is to visualize the target island relative to a second reference island's alignment with a succession of selected stars, points of the star compass. It is a refined system of dead reckoning whereby the navigator constantly synthesizes his position relative to <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> island's location in his mental model. The most remarkable thing is that <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> island (lu pongank) may be over the horizon, unseen, even imaginary.|$|E

5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
