5|$|DAB+ is a {{major upgrade}} <b>to</b> <b>DAB,</b> widely used in other {{countries}} in Europe. It was first tested in the United Kingdom in 2013 before regular services were launched in 2016. DAB+ is not backwards compatible with DAB so older radios cannot receive DAB+ stations. There are no plans {{in the foreseeable future}} {{for the vast majority of}} BBC and commercial stations to transition from DAB to DAB+. Estimates given by multiplex operator Switch Digital suggests that a third of radio sets in 2016 were DAB+ compatible.|$|E
25|$|Vinegar (3–10% aqueous acetic acid) {{may be used}} as {{a common}} remedy to help with box {{jellyfish}} stings, but not the stings of the Portuguese man o' war (which is not a true jellyfish, but a siphonophore). For stings on or around the eyes, a towel dampened with vinegar may be used <b>to</b> <b>dab</b> around the eyes, with care taken to avoid the eyeballs. Salt water {{may be used as}} an alternative if vinegar is unavailable; and may be preferred over vinegar. Fresh water is not usually used if the sting occurs in salt water, as changes in tonicity can release additional venom. Rubbing wounds, or using alcohol, spirits, ammonia, or urine may have strongly negative effects as these can encourage the release of venom.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Digital One {{started a}} very rapid roll out of DAB {{multiplexed}} enabled transmitters. Both Caradon Hill and Four Lanes/Redruth {{were converted to}} transmit DAB signals {{for the first time}} in 2000. This enabled DAB to be heard {{for the first time in}} Cornwall, although due to the still scarcity of sets, not many listeners were tuning in on launch day. That all changed in 2002, when Pure launched their Evoke 1 set at GB£100, by far the cheapest at that time. Other manufactures followed, and the price by 2004 had gone below the GB£50 mark, enabling a much greater consumer take up. However, DAB signal reception within Cornwall remained patchy, and was (and at 2007 still is) virtually non-existent in areas like Falmouth. The BBC did not come <b>to</b> <b>DAB</b> in Cornwall until 2003, three years behind the commercial rival, and even then this was broadcasting to mid and east Cornwall only, as Redruth was not DAB enabled by the BBC until late in 2004.|$|E

On 29 January 2009 the UK Government's interim report into digital communication for the future by Lord Carter, Digital Britain, made the suggestion that DAB would be the future direction of digital radio in the United Kingdom.

500|$|In the United Kingdom, the {{roll-out}} {{of digital}} radio is proceeding since engineering test transmissions were {{started by the}} BBC in 1990 followed by a public launch in September 1995. The UK currently has the world's biggest digital radio network, with 103transmitters, three national DAB ensembles and 48local and regional DAB ensembles broadcasting over 250commercial and 34BBC radio stations across the UK. In the capital, London there are already more than 64different digital stations available. In addition <b>to</b> <b>DAB</b> and DAB+, radio stations are also broadcast on digital television platform as well as internet radio in the UK. [...] Digital radio ensemble operators and stations need a broadcasting licence from the UK's media regulator Ofcom to broadcast.|$|E
500|$|Ofcom {{estimates}} {{that even after}} extra spectrum has been allocated <b>to</b> <b>DAB,</b> around 90local radio stations {{will be unable to}} transmit on DAB, either because there is no space for them on a local DAB multiplex, or because they cannot afford the high transmission costs of DAB that the multiplex operators are charging. Ofcom announced in 2005 that it regarded Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) as an option for local stations unable to secure carriage or unable to pay the high transmission costs of DAB. The success of the small scale DAB multiplexes may alleviate this issue to some degree. One of the drawbacks of DAB and DAB+ has not been addressed. In simple terms the frequency of a broadcast is the carrier frequency (i.e. a sine wave). In order to carry any information the carrier frequency must be modulated. The signal at the receiver (radio) is then demodulated and the information is retrieved. The demodulators for FM signals are almost instantaneous so that one can have radios in different areas and move between those areas to hear the broadcast continuously. In contrast the demodulators for digital signals take a finite time and each digital radio takes a different time to demodulate the broadcast signal, so that if you move between different radios that are spatially apart you are likely to hear the same part of the broadcast twice or miss parts of it depending on the time to demodulate the signal of the individual radios. The other drawback with DAB is that it is all or nothing. If there is any interference or loss due to moving out of the footprint of the broadcast signal you will receive no signal, whereas in the case of FM you can hear something even if it is crackly.|$|E

60|$|I see it still, that pathetically ridiculous little figure, jogging doggedly {{over the}} dank fields. Mile after mile it runs, the little idiot; jumping--sometimes {{falling into the}} muddy ditches: it seems anxious rather than {{otherwise}} to get itself into a mess; scrambling through the dripping hedges; swarming over tarry fence and slimy paling.

At intervals it stops an instant <b>to</b> <b>dab</b> its eyes with its dingy little rag of a handkerchief, to rearrange the bundle under its arm, its chief anxiety to keep well {{out of sight of}} chance wanderers, to dodge farmhouses, to dart across highroads when nobody is looking. And so tear-smeared and mud-bespattered up the long rise of darkening Crouch End Lane, where to-night the electric light blazes from a hundred shops, and dead beat into the Seven Sisters Road station, there to tear off its soaked jersey; and then home to Poplar, with shameless account of the jolly afternoon that it has spent, of the admiration and the praise that it has won.|$|E
