Yunupingu said he drank {{up to four}} cartons of alcohol a day. [...] "Alcohol was a big influence in my life.

2500|$|In February 2011, after Corinthians were {{eliminated}} from the 2011 Copa Libertadores by the Colombian team Deportes Tolima, Ronaldo announced his retirement from football, concluding an 18-year career. In an emotional press conference on 14 February, he cited pain and hypothyroidism as the reasons for his premature retirement. Ronaldo admitted his body had finally succumbed to the crippling litany of injuries that had blighted his career: [...] "It's very hard to leave something that made me so happy. Mentally I wanted to continue but I have to acknowledge that I lost <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>body.</b> The head wants to go on but the body can't take any more. I think of an action but I can't {{do it the way}} I want to. It's time to go." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 4, 2017, Márquez {{announced}} his retirement from professional boxing after a 21 year career. Márquez spoke to ESPN Deportes TV show Golpe a Golpe, [...] "Today is a special and sad day for me because I'm announcing my retirement. The injuries pushed me to make this decision. It hurts, but I believe {{the right moment to}} put an end to my career has arrived. I would have loved to do a final fight to say goodbye inside the ring, but I have to listen <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>body,</b> and it was telling me that the right moment to stop boxing is now." [...] He ended his career with a record of record of 56 wins, 7 losses and 1 draw, with 40 knockouts.

2500|$|In {{her teenage}} years, she {{was locked up}} in a Nigerian prison cell because of her femininity. Being imprisoned {{encouraged}} her to leave Nigeria, if she could not have left, the other option was to finally succeed in ending her life. She remembered her experiences in this poignant piece she wrote for Gay Star News on Transgender Day of Remembrance on 20 November 2013, which was re-published by some online news outlets:I wish I could tell the younger me who tried to commit suicide twice that life gets better and dreams do honestly come through. [...] I did not imagine life could be this amazing many years ago after being released from a horrid Nigerian prison for being different. Then all I could think was I could die in this prison and no one will know or care. [...] Being imprisoned felt justifiable, considering I was being punished for being 'gay' as they assumed due to my feminine features and mannerisms. [...] I wasn't gay, I am a woman born differently due to natural defects. What I felt did not match my outward appearance. Being assigned male at birth doesn't make me a man or a woman, nobody was born a man or a woman, you are born male or female, then you develop into your preferred gender as you grow up thus making you a man or a woman. For me that gender was female. I was born male but my brain, gestures, features and carriage functioned as that of a female. Growing up and not knowing what was happening <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>body</b> made me confused and lost. I couldn't discuss it with my family because my femininity was frowned upon due to religion and I could not talk to my friends because they would not understand what I was going through. I found solace in music and dreams. I dreamt of being free to be myself, free of insults, free of judgment and free from harassments.
