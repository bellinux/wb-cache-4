5|$|By the 15th century, writers, artists, {{and architects}} in Italy {{were well aware}} of the transformations that were taking place and were using phrases such as modi antichi (in <b>the</b> <b>antique</b> manner) or alle romana et alla antica (in the manner of the Romans and the ancients) to {{describe}} their work. In the 1330s Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (ancient) and to the Christian period as nova (new). From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.|$|E
5|$|The book's {{coverage}} is erratic, {{a direct result}} of the sources that Bewick consulted: his own knowledge of British animals, the available scholarly sources, combined with George Culley's 1786 Observations on Livestock and <b>the</b> <b>antique</b> John Caius's 1576 On English Dogs. Bewick had to hand the Swedish naturalist Anders Sparrman's account of his visit to the Cape of Good Hope on Cook's expedition of 1772 to 1776, and animals from the Southern Cape figure largely in the book. It was an energetic muddle, but it was at once greeted with enthusiasm by the British public. They liked the combination of vigorous woodcuts, simple and accurate descriptions, and all kinds of exotic animals alongside things they knew.|$|E
5|$|The classic view of Domitian {{is usually}} negative, {{since most of}} <b>the</b> <b>antique</b> sources {{were related to the}} Senatorial or aristocratic class, with which Domitian had {{notoriously}} difficult relations. Furthermore, contemporary historians such as Pliny the Younger, Tacitus and Suetonius all wrote down the information on his reign after it had ended, and his memory had been condemned to oblivion. The work of Domitian's court poets Martial and Statius constitutes virtually the only literary evidence concurrent with his reign. Perhaps as unsurprising as the attitude of post-Domitianic historians, the poems of Martial and Statius are highly adulatory, praising Domitian's achievements as equalling those of the gods.|$|E

5000|$|... {{instruments}} were built uncompromisingly {{in the mode}} of <b>the</b> <b>antiques,</b> with practically no concessions to modernity. His cases were made of plank wood, with classical case framing; he used wood, rather than brass or plastic for his upper and lower guides, and like <b>the</b> <b>antiques,</b> his jacks had no adjustment screws; his keyboards were light and of harpsichord proportions, and he rejected the use of pedals. Skowroneck, in other words, immersed himself in the building practices of <b>the</b> <b>antiques</b> and did his best to emulate them. He succeeded brilliantly.|$|R

5|$|The novel extrapolates Balzac's {{analysis}} of desire {{from the individual}} to society; he feared that the world, like Valentin, was losing its way due to material excess and misguided priorities. In the gambling house, the orgiastic feast, <b>the</b> <b>antique</b> shop, and the discussions with men of science, Balzac examines this dilemma in various contexts. The lust for social status to which Valentin is led by Rastignac is emblematic of this excess; the gorgeous but unattainable Foedora symbolizes the pleasures offered by high society.|$|E
5|$|More {{proposals}} {{were made in}} 2007. Replacing the bridge would cost $7–8 million and take two years to complete. Rehabilitation would require bringing the bridge up to code so it could carry loads of up to 40 tons (36 tonnes). A preservation group formed to oppose a replacement. Its founder compared the bridge to the Dingmans Ferry Bridge on the Pennsylvania–New Jersey border, which carries similar traffic loads. One possibility is to replace the bridge, and move <b>the</b> <b>antique</b> structure elsewhere in Sullivan County, since it is a popular tourist attraction. In June 2008, a compromise was made defining {{the possibility of a}} $12 million bridge to replace the 104-year-old deteriorating structure. PennDOT has suggested that they will let anyone preserve the bridge by taking it somewhere else. However, there has been no response, and plans for the new bridge were initially scheduled to begin by 2010.|$|E
5|$|Most of Roxas, {{population}} 100,000, was underwater {{due to the}} storm. Around 80% {{of houses}} there were damaged, 40–50% homes were destroyed, and 100people were killed. Throughout the surrounding Capiz province, 265people were killed and many towns were underwater. In that province and Illoilo, damage totaled $40million, with property damage in just Capiz amounting to $25million. Throughout Panay Island, 448fatalities were reported and at least eight people were injured. Island-wide, the storm destroyed five bridges and thirty-five schools. It also wrecked dozens of fishing boats, and uprooted trees. There, 4,014homes were demolished, resulting in more than 24,000individuals losing their homes. Elsewhere, 41people were killed in Leyte Island and Samar Island. In the former, two ships capsized that resulted in two drownings and property damage totaled $40million. In <b>the</b> <b>Antique</b> province, authorities reported five deaths. In the Romblon province, five casualties occurred. On Cebu Island, six people died. Within {{the vicinity of the}} island nation, 38children died aboard a ferry boat after it sunk, though the adults on the boat swam to safety.|$|E
