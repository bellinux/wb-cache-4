5|$|The {{north side}} of the DeKalb County Courthouse is not as ornately {{decorated}} as the south face but each has its own distinctive qualities. <b>The</b> <b>courthouse</b> drive, entering from Exchange Street, crosses below a stone porte-cochere on <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> property. The back side of the building features four pilasters with composite capitals which give <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> a temple appearance.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> building, {{the public square}} contains several outbuildings and sites that are also historic in nature and considered contributing properties to the Oregon Commercial Historic District, including a sculpture by Lorado Taft and a cast-iron fountain. <b>The</b> <b>courthouse</b> joined the Register in 1981 and was included as a contributing property to the historic district in 2006. After initially joining the Register the structure underwent a careful restoration. <b>The</b> <b>courthouse</b> no longer serves as the primary judiciary center for the county; its successor is located directly across the street.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>courthouse</b> {{was used}} as the primary seat of {{government}} for Hudson County from its opening on September 20, 1910 until the construction of the Hudson County Administration Building in 1966. <b>The</b> <b>courthouse</b> was vacant for many years and was scheduled for demolition. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 25, 1970. Restoration began in the mid-1970s, and the building was reopened in 1985. In 1984, the Hudson County Board of Chosen Freeholders renamed the building in honor of Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr. The restoration of <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> was acknowledged by a Victorian Society in America Preservation Award in 1988.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> new <b>courthouse</b> houses {{many of the}} {{functions}} originally housed in the Frank E. Moss Federal <b>Courthouse.</b> <b>The</b> Moss <b>Courthouse,</b> a Classical Revival structure completed in 1905, underwent renovations in 1912 and 1932 and {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The construction of <b>the</b> new <b>courthouse</b> was prompted by needs for space, technology, and security in <b>the</b> Moss <b>Courthouse.</b> <b>The</b> new <b>courthouse</b> separates prisoner transport areas from hallways used by the public and staff; in <b>the</b> old <b>courthouse,</b> prisoners, judges, and members of the public shared the same hallways and elevators, presenting a security risk. <b>The</b> Moss <b>Courthouse</b> continues to house the U.S. bankruptcy court. <b>The</b> two <b>courthouses</b> are linked by an elevated landscaped garden. The AIA Institute Honor Award jury citation states that <b>the</b> new <b>courthouse</b> [...] "stands respectfully beside" [...] <b>the</b> Moss <b>Courthouse</b> and <b>the</b> two <b>courthouses</b> together [...] "establish a distinct federal precinct and architectural anchor at the southwest perimeter of the downtown." ...|$|R

5|$|Mason {{had long}} battled against Alexandria merchants who he felt unfairly {{dominated}} the county court, {{if only because}} they could more easily get to <b>the</b> <b>courthouse.</b> In 1789, he drafted legislation to move <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> {{to the center of}} the county, though it did not pass in his lifetime. In 1798, the legislature passed an authorizing act, and <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> opened in 1801. Most of those at Gunston Hall, both family and slaves, fell ill during the summer of 1792, experiencing chills and fever; when those subsided, Mason caught a chest cold. When Jefferson visited Gunston Hall on October 1, 1792, he found Mason, long a martyr to gout, needing a crutch to walk, though still sound in mind and memory. Additional ailments, possibly pneumonia, set in. Less than a week after Jefferson's visit, on October 7, George Mason died at Gunston Hall, and was subsequently buried on the estate, within sight of the house he had built and of the Potomac River.|$|E

5|$|A {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} gathered outside <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked {{a large group of}} those gathered to shake their fists and yell so he could get a picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> and rushed forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon. Martial law was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville.|$|E
5|$|After the Spring Street {{intersection}} {{another two}} blocks past <b>the</b> <b>courthouse,</b> Main Street curves to the south, narrowing in the process. It {{is now a}} two-lane road. Two blocks to the south, SH 82 turns east again to follow East Cooper Avenue, crossing the Roaring Fork again after another two blocks. The highway curves southward, leaving Aspen three-quarters of a mile (1.1km) further east.|$|E

5|$|Friedrich Kellner was {{a justice}} {{inspector}} in <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> in Mainz between 1903 and 1933. From 1914 until 1918, {{he served as}} a soldier in the German army.

For ten years, Kellner openly campaigned against the Nazis until they came to power in 1933.|$|E
5|$|On 15 August 1998 the RIRA left a car {{containing}} 500lb of home-made explosives in {{the centre}} of Omagh, County Tyrone. The bombers {{could not find a}} parking space near the intended target of <b>the</b> <b>courthouse,</b> and the car was left 400 metres away. As a result, three inaccurate telephone warnings were issued, and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) believed the bomb was located outside <b>the</b> <b>courthouse.</b> They attempted to establish a security cordon to keep civilians clear of the area, which inadvertently pushed people closer to the location of the bomb. Shortly after, the bomb exploded killing 29 people and injuring 220 others, in what became the single deadliest strike of the Troubles.|$|E
50|$|Although some {{citizens}} believed Bowling Green was {{no longer}} the most practical or logical site for a new <b>courthouse,</b> <b>the</b> commissioners quickly decided to build <b>the</b> third <b>courthouse</b> on <b>the</b> site of the previous one in Bowling Green. Built of brick, at a cost of $11,000, and very similar to <b>the</b> previous <b>courthouse,</b> <b>the</b> new <b>Courthouse</b> began serving <b>the</b> county in the Fall of 1853.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> old <b>courthouse</b> was advertised {{for sale}} and fell into disuse. In 1967, during the Centennial Celebration of Watseka, the Iroquois County Historical Society was organized, and {{circulated}} petitions throughout the county not to sell <b>the</b> Old <b>Courthouse.</b> <b>The</b> petitions were approved by the County Board of Supervisors, and <b>the</b> Old <b>Courthouse</b> re-opened as a museum that same year.

50|$|The current {{building}} is <b>the</b> county's fourth <b>courthouse</b> and {{was built in}} 1906. <b>The</b> first <b>courthouse</b> was used from 1787 to 1801. <b>The</b> second <b>courthouse</b> was demolished in 1854 and the third was demolished in 1901. <b>The</b> fourth <b>courthouse</b> was designed in a Beaux Arts style by William S.

5|$|Plans for {{restoring}} <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> had been proposed {{even before it}} fell into disuse. In 1961, the architectural modelist Theodore Conrad proposed converting the building into a new city hall for Jersey City. The plan would have created a mall {{in front of the}} building and surrounded it with additional city buildings and a museum. Another proposal would house a branch of the New Jersey State Museum in the building. Conrad led a citizens group that lobbied for the preservation of the building, and got it listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The award-winning restoration project resulted in <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> being reopened in 1985 for the use of the civil courts and other county offices.|$|E
