The comic contains other clues about the setting, such as the house system that is described {{at the end of the}} first chapter. This system is similar to that used by many UK schools, including <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>the</b> author attended; Siddell has even stated that the school in which Gunnerkrigg Court takes place is modeled after his own secondary school.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{was born}} {{five days after the}} September 15 cutoff date for {{eligibility}} in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, there was a significant effort made to allow Tavares into the Draft. Following his 72-goal campaign in 2006–07, Tavares' agents asked the NHL and NHL Players' Association (NHLPA) to make an exception for Tavares similar to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>the</b> OHL had made in 2005. The attempt was unsuccessful, however, and Tavares was forced to wait until 2009 to participate in the League Entry Draft. In October 2007, however, it was reported that then-Toronto Maple Leafs General Manager John Ferguson, Jr., had offered the 17-year-old Tavares a spot with the team's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Toronto Marlies. Like the NHL, however, the AHL declined to amend its by-laws, and Tavares subsequently returned to the OHL.|$|E

5|$|One of history's great Chiefs of Staff {{and a key}} {{member of}} the Imperial Staff, Schmitt was the most {{experienced}} Austrian leader, called out of retirement for this specific task of organizing the Austro-Russian retreat. He had wide experience as a leader: From the summer of 1796 {{until his retirement in}} 1800, he had been Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Army, of the Lower Rhine, the Rhine, and the Army of Germany, and a trusted member of Archduke Charles' staff. Consequently, he had organized a variety of maneuvers and battle plans under different terrain. The military historian Digby Smith hypothesizes that Schmitt, an experienced officer and sound tactician, would have been more effective at the Battle of Austerlitz, at least more effective than his replacement, Franz von Weyrother, as Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Allied Army. After Schmitt's death, Weyrother, the architect of the Austrian defeat at Hohenlinden, developed the general battle plan of the Allied action at Austerlitz. In the long run, it was unlikely that Schmitt's plan would have changed the overall outcome—Austerlitz was arguably one of Napoleon's finest battles—but his battle plan would no doubt have been an improvement over <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>the</b> Allies used.|$|E
5|$|The {{next night}} at 1945 hrs, a craft similar to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>the</b> night before {{approached}} the base. In {{addition to being}} tracked on radar, it hovered around the area for 30 minutes, with characteristics of movement similar to a helicopter. Additionally, it hovered above the weapons storage area at the same altitude as the night before. At this time, possibly another object (it is unclear {{if it was the}} same one as the over the weapons storage area, but it is possible) was spotted over the flightline. The cigar-shaped object was described as hovering in mid-air, jerking around, and turning on and off its lights once. During the blackout, it traveled from the flightline, to the northern end of the runway. According to one service member, the object was chased, and eventually discovered to be hovering five feet off the ground. During this time, it was determined that the object was four car lengths long.|$|E
5|$|Title to real {{property}} acquired by recipients with federal awards vests with the recipient. It {{must be used}} for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose.

However it may not dispose of or encumber the title to {{real property}} without prior federal government consent. When it is no longer needed for the federally supported programs or projects, the recipient must request disposition instructions from the federal government. As with equipment, if the property is sold, a proportionate share is provided to the federal government, amount of the current fair market value, based on the percent of federal funds to own recipient's fund used to acquire the item.|$|E

5|$|When {{all four}} cards of the trick {{are on the}} table, the pair that played the card with the strongest card wins the hand. The trump suit beats the other three suits, with the ranking of trump cards from strongest to weakest as follows: Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. The next strongest suit is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>the</b> first player played, again with the card rankings being Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. Cards {{of the other two}} suits always lose to trumps and the first player's suit. The winning team places the four cards from the trick into their baza. The rules for the {{declarations}} are similar to Two-player Tute, but it is mandatory to declare the cards after a player or the partner begins a baza. Only the scoring team can declare. To declare their cards, the opposing team has to begin a baza. Declaring cards in the plays that follow the beginning of a baza is not allowed. After the hand is over, the counting starts (see Scoring below). When the counting ends, and after the score is calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stack to be dealt {{at the start of the}} next round. The deal of cards rotates counter-clockwise during the subsequent hands.|$|E

25|$|While the Rams were {{unmatched}} offensively, the Browns' defense gave up {{half as many}} points during the regular season.

In addition, the Soviets provided Germany with access to the Northern Sea Route for both cargo ships and raiders (though only the raider Komet used the route before June 1941), which forced Britain to protect sea lanes in both the Atlantic and the Pacific.|$|E

25|$|At the June 1994, {{grand jury}} hearing, Ross Cutlery {{provided}} store receipts indicating that Simpson had purchased a 12-inch (305mm) stiletto knife {{six weeks before}} the murders. The knife {{was determined to be}} similar to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>the</b> coroner said caused the stab wounds. The prosecution did not present this evidence at trial after discovering that store employees had sold their story to The National Enquirer for $12,500. The knife was later collected from Simpson's residence by his attorneys; they presented it to Judge Ito and it was subsequently sealed in a manila envelope to be opened only if brought up at trial. This was not the murder weapon: tests on the knife determined that an oil used on new cutlery was still present on the knife, indicating the knife had never been used. The police searched Simpson's Rockingham estate three times and could not find this knife. Simpson told his attorneys exactly where it was in the house and it was promptly recovered.|$|E

On Texas' next possession, Terry Orr scored from eight yards out to cap an 11-play, 80-yard drive to put the Longhorns up 14–10 with 2:05 remaining. Alabama's Joey Jones returned the ensuing kickoff to the Texas 38-yard line, and Tide quarterback Walter Lewis took over with 1:54 left.
