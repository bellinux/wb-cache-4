25|$|Not {{only did}} the infamous game-losing play make {{kneeling}} acceptable, {{but most of the}} teams using it changed how it was done. Prior to Pisarcik's fumble, teams had employed standard offensive formations such as an I or a split backfield. The Eagles' unlikely touchdown, however, had made the weakness of doing so glaring. Even though Pisarcik had been trying to hand off instead of kneeling, when he fumbled the snap, there was not only no offensive player <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to recover it, no one was in position to tackle Edwards and prevent the touchdown either.|$|E
25|$|In 1885 Hobhouse {{accepted}} a peerage as Baron Hobhouse, of Hadspen in the County of Somerset, {{with a view}} to assisting in the judicial work of the House of Lords, but a statutory qualification by which only judges of the high courts of the United Kingdom could sit to hear appeals had been overlooked. In 1887 the disqualification was removed by Act of Parliament in regard to members of the Judicial Committee; but Hobhouse did not take up the work of a judge in the House of Lords. He only sat <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> three cases, in two of which, Russell v. Countess of Russell (1897 Appeal Cases 395) and the Kempton Park case (1899 Appeal Cases 143), he was in a dissenting minority. As a judge Hobhouse, who was always careful and painstaking, invariably stated the various arguments fully and fairly, but he was tenacious of his deliberately formed opinion.|$|E

2500|$|Following the Kentucky Campaign, Frazer again {{resigned}} from the Confederate Army in late 1862. His most notable military service occurred after he was appointed a brigadier general on May 19, 1863, and given command of the 5th Brigade of the Army of Tennessee that July. His force consisted of about 2,300 men in three regiments and a battery of artillery, and was ordered to defend the Cumberland Gap [...] "at all hazards" [...] by area commander Maj. Gen. Simon B. Buckner, who was himself ordered to rejoin the Army of Tennessee {{just prior to the}} Battle of Chickamauga.
