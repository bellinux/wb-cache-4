5|$|July 1992: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Darby caused cloudiness in California. These clouds were also enough {{to delay the}} landing of the Space Shuttle Columbia for a day, and cause it <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> Florida instead of California.|$|E
5|$|Lack of an {{available}} airborne division {{forced the}} Allies to assemble {{an ad hoc}} formation, the 1st Airborne Task Force, in Italy on 1July1944. Its objective was <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> the River Argens valley between Le Muy and Le Luc to prevent any German reinforcements reaching the landing beaches.|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 2008, it was {{announced}} that the airport would install a Category III landing system, allowing planes <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> low visibility conditions, such as fog. This system will be {{the first of its kind}} in Australia, and was commissioned March 2010 at a cost of $10 million.|$|E

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E
5|$|All Atlantic Category5 hurricanes {{have made}} {{landfall}} at some location at hurricane strength. Most Category5 hurricanes in the Atlantic make landfall {{because of their}} proximity <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, where the usual synoptic weather patterns carry them towards land, {{as opposed to the}} westward, oceanic mean track of Eastern Pacific hurricanes. Sixteen of the storms made landfall while at Category5 intensity; 2007 and 2017 are the only years in which two storms made landfall at this intensity.|$|E
5|$|Banded sea kraits {{primarily}} feed on {{varieties of}} eels, but also eat small fish. Males and females exhibit sexual dimorphism in hunting behavior, as adult females, which are significantly larger than males, prefer to hunt in deeper water for larger conger eels, while adult males hunt in shallower water for smaller moray eels. In addition, females hunt {{for only one}} prey item per foraging bout, while males often hunt for multiple items. After hunting, the banded sea kraits return <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> order to digest their prey.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Longwang made landfall, 37shelters opened across the island, {{accommodating}} nearly 1,000people. Additionally, 5,464Chinese fishermen temporarily sheltered at Taiwanese ports. All airports were closed on October2 and sea travel was suspended. With international airports shut down, President Chen, who was {{returning from a}} visit to the United Arab Emirates, was forced <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia. The landing in Indonesia was seen as a political breakthrough for Taiwan as Indonesia does not recognize them as a separate nation from China.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in September, {{there was}} Operation Comet, {{in which the}} division's three brigades were <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> the Netherlands and each capture a river crossing. The first of these was the bridge over the River Waal at Nijmegen, the second the bridge over the River Maas at Grave, and the last was the bridge over the River Rhine at Arnhem. Planning for Comet was well {{advanced}} when on 10September the mission was cancelled. Instead, a new operation was proposed with the same objectives as Comet but {{to be carried out}} by three divisions of the First Allied Airborne Army.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell, who {{had limited}} {{communications}} with his division headquarters, {{was concerned that}} his force would be cut off by fierce and chaotic fighting at Sarimbun and Jurong to the south west, involving the Australian 22nd Brigade. Maxwell's force consequently withdrew from the seafront. This allowed the Japanese <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> increasing strength and take control of Kranji village. They also captured Woodlands, and began repairing the causeway, without encountering any Allied attacks.|$|E

50|$|On March 1, 1781 the Articles of Confederation {{took effect}} with Maryland's ratification. The {{articles}} had initially been {{submitted to the}} states on November 17, 1777, but the ratification process dragged on for several years, stalled by an interstate quarrel over claims <b>to</b> uncolonized <b>land</b> <b>in</b> the west. Maryland was the last hold-out; it refused to ratify until Virginia and New York agreed to rescind their claims <b>to</b> <b>lands</b> <b>in</b> what became the Northwest Territory.|$|R

5|$|Montagu {{outlined}} three {{criteria for}} the document that contained {{the details of the}} falsified plans <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> the Balkans. He said that the target should be casually but clearly identified, that it should name Sicily and another location as cover, and that it should be in an unofficial correspondence that would not normally be sent by diplomatic courier, or encoded signal.|$|E
5|$|On September 3, a C-130 Hercules {{air force}} flight left Caracas, Venezuela for Spain, with a flight crew of 8 and 60 {{members of the}} Central University of Venezuela choir. That night, heavy {{rainfall}} from the hurricane forced the plane {{to land on the}} Azores island of Terceira Island, Portugal. After attempting twice <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> hurricane-force winds, the plane crashed in a hill one mile from the runway of Lajes Field, killing all 68 aboard.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} Allied units <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> Normandy was 'D' Company of the 2nd Ox and Bucks Light Infantry, {{commanded}} by Major John Howard. The company, attached to the 5th Parachute Brigade, carried out Operation Deadstick, a coup de main assault on two bridges crossing the Caen Canal and the River Orne.|$|E

5|$|Schnaufer {{submitted}} {{a proposal to}} his commander, Walter Grabmann, commanding 3. Jagd-Division (3rd Fighter Division), that a intruder operation {{be allowed to take}} place. Schnaufer proposed waiting until the enemy had crossed beyond the lines over the North Sea before attacking them. Grabmann was enthusiastic, and suggested the operation go further and attack the enemy bombers while they were attempting <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> eastern England. Schnaufer also became aware of Schmid's desire for an intruder operation at this time and personally urged him to approach the High Command once more.|$|E
5|$|The 41st (5th North Staffordshire Regiment) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Engineers, {{previously}} the 5th North Staffords, {{served in}} Anti-Aircraft Command {{as part of}} the air defence of the Midlands from 1939 to 1944. The regiment became the first complete searchlight regiment <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> Normandy after the D-Day landings of 6 June 1944. It served with 21st Army Group, as part of 31st (North Midland) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, {{until the end of the}} war in Europe and then undertook garrison duty in Lower Saxony.|$|E
5|$|The Fra Mauro {{formation}} (or Fra Mauro Highlands) is a selenological formation on {{the near}} side of Earth's Moon {{that served as the}} landing site for the American Apollo 14 mission in 1971. It is named after the 80-kilometer-diameter crater Fra Mauro, located within it. The formation, as well as Fra Mauro crater, take their names from a 15th-century Italian monk and mapmaker of the same name. Apollo 13 was originally scheduled <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> the Fra Mauro highlands, but was unable due to an in-flight technical failure.|$|E

5|$|The Special Police Airborne Unit, {{using three}} helicopters, was {{deployed}} on 17 August 1990 to quell a Croatian Serb insurrection {{in and around}} Knin. Established in 1968, {{it was the only}} combat capable unit of the Croatian military at that time. En route, two Yugoslav Air Force fighters intercepted the helicopters and forced them <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> Ogulin. The day is now considered to be the date when the first unit of the Croatian special police was founded. Following the incident, additional special police units were set up, the bulk of which were formed between September 1990 and September 1991.|$|E
5|$|The aborted Apollo 13 {{mission was}} {{originally}} scheduled {{to land at}} Fra Mauro, with Apollo 14 scheduled <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> the Littrow region of Mare Serenitatis. After Apollo 13 failed to land, {{it was decided to}} re-target Apollo 14 to Fra Mauro, as it was regarded as more interesting scientifically than the Littrow site. There, Apollo 14 had the objective of sampling ejecta from the Imbrium impact to gain insight into the Moon's geologic history. A landing site near the freshly formed Cone crater was chosen, as this crater served as a 'natural drill hole' to allow the astronauts to obtain Imbrium ejecta, the primary objective of the mission.|$|E
5|$|The {{family was}} {{conceived}} by Groening shortly before a solicitation {{for a series}} of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became an early hit for Fox, becoming the network's first series <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–90).|$|E
