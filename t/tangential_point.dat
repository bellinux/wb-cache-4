50|$|Electric griddles are {{typically}} {{made of a}} thinner plate material than a similar gas griddle to improve the heat transfer between the bottom-mounted elements and the cooking surface. Elements used to heat the griddle {{are typically}} 4-5 kilowatt (kW) per linear foot, and made from round rod sheathed incoloy material whose geometry is designed to optimize temperature distribution across the plate. The round elements have a <b>tangential</b> <b>point</b> of contact with the griddle plate and are commonly {{held in place by}} a clamping bracket or plate. More than one element per linear foot is common, and an array of these elements is required to heat a griddle plate of any given width. Electric griddles tend to be less expensive than a gas unit of similar size, due largely to the reduced plate thickness, but also the generally lower cost of construction and reduced sophistication of most electric griddle control systems.|$|E

For such complicated movement curve, it’s necessary to find a proper path approximation method to meet the high requirement of speed and precision of path interpolation.

The principle can be applied for modernization of the radio occultation (RO) remote sensing of the atmospheres and ionospheres of the Earth and other planets. The principle states that significant contributions to variations of the intensity and phase of the radio waves passing through a layered medium are connected with influence of the vicinities of <b>tangential</b> <b>points</b> where the refractivity gradient is perpendicular to the radio ray trajectory.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} principle of local interaction of radio waves with a refractive spherical medium is formulated and illustrated using the radio occultation (RO) method of remote sensing {{of the atmosphere}} and the ionosphere of the Earth and the planets. In accordance with this principle, the main contribution to variations of the amplitude and the phase of radio waves propagating through a medium makes a neighborhood of a <b>tangential</b> <b>point,</b> where the gradient of the refractive index is perpendicular to the radio wave trajectory. A necessary and sufficient condition (a criterion) is established to detect the displacement of the <b>tangential</b> <b>point</b> from the radio ray perigee using analysis of the RO experimental data. This criterion {{is applied to the}} identification and the location of layers in the atmosphere and the ionosphere by the use of Global Positioning System RO data. RO data from the CHAllenge Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) are used to validate the criterion introduced when significant variations of the amplitude and the phase of the RO signals are observed at the RO ray perigee altitudes below 80 km. The detected criterion opens a new avenue in terms of measuring the altitude and the slope of the atmospheric and ionospheric layers. This is important for the location determination of the wind shear and the direction of internal wave propagation in the lower ionosphere and possibly in the atmosphere. The new criterion provides an improved estimation of the altitude and the location of the ionospheric plasma layers compared with the backpropagation radio-holographic method previously used...|$|E
30|$|The {{vertical}} distribution of aerosols that {{extend up to}} ~ 100  km altitude is observed with the limb-viewing geometry around the dayside periapsis passages by using UVI, IR 1 (0.90  μm), and LIR.

When the periapsis altitude is 1000  km, the minimum distance to the <b>tangential</b> <b>point</b> is 3500  km, and this gives a vertical resolution of 0.7  km for UVI and IR 1 and 3  km for LIR.|$|E

From both two-dimensional (120 radial and 360 <b>tangential</b> <b>points)</b> and three-dimensional (60 radial levels and spherical harmonics up to order and degree L = 33, m = 33), it is shown that for a spherical shell (with inner-to-outer radii ratio eta = 0. 62) convection becomes time-dependent, with l = 2 dominating, at a Rayleigh number of about 31 times supercritical for a constant-viscosity, base-heated configuration. This secondary instability is characterized by oscillatory time dependence, with higher frequencies involved, at slightly higher Rayleigh numbers.

Coherent pulsations with a period of 4. 7394 ± 0. 0008 s were detected in the brightest flare phase. The X-ray spectra in the quiescent and flare phases were fitted with an absorbed power-law model with a photon index ∼ 1 plus a narrow Gaussian line at the center energy of 6. 4 keV.

The total counts of the A-IMAP red channel and the IMAP/VISI data along the green line shown in Fig.  6 a are plotted with the red and blue lines, respectively. To {{examine the effect of}} the vertical summation range, we show the latitudinal profile of the A-IMAP data with the summation range from 230 to 300  km with the red dash line in addition to that with the summation range from 180 to 300  km. The center of the EIA was located around 5.5 ° S for both observations. Although the enhancement peak locations showed a good coincidence, the width of the enhancement observed by A-IMAP was wider than that observed by IMAP/VISI. We computed a nonlinear least-squares fit for each latitudinal profile to a function f([...] x [...]) = A_ 0 e^z/ 2 + A_ 3 + A_ 4 where z = x - A_ 1 /A_ 2. Assuming the width of EIA is twice large as the full-width half maxima, we determined the edge of the EIA for each profile. The southern edge for each profile is indicated with the vertical arrow of each line type in Fig.  6. The southern edge of the EIA in the red channel with the summation range from 180 to 300  km was wider by about 3.3 ° in latitude or 450  km in distance than that in the IMAP/VISI observation, while the edge in the red channel with the summation range from 230 to 300  km was wider by about 2.2 ° in latitude or 300  km in distance that in the IMAP/VISI observation. The wider enhancement structure in the limb count profile of the photographs would be attributed to the horizontally integrated observation path. There was about 520 -km horizontal distance between the <b>tangential</b> <b>points</b> in the altitude range from 180 and 300  km in each image. For the summation range from 230 to 300  km, the horizontal distance between the <b>tangential</b> <b>points</b> is about 330  km. It means that the limb observation integrated the structure horizontally for about 520 or 330  km depending on its summation range. As a result, the horizontally extended shape of EIA was observed in the A-IMAP data. The difference in the EIA width derived from different summation altitude ranges {{can be explained by the}} difference in horizontal distance between the <b>tangential</b> <b>points</b> in each summation range. On the other hand, IMAP/VISI has a relatively vertical integration path and can observe the true horizontal edge of the EIA. Therefore, it is reasonable that the results from different observation geometries have difference in the EIA edge. Although there is a difference in the width of the structure caused by the observation geometry, the EIA enhancement locations from the two observations have a good agreement. This agreement supports the validity of the proposed calibration method.|$|R

In {{order to}} study the common {{nonlinear}} characteristics of the vibration isolator, a single degree of freedom system with cubic restoring force is introduced to describe the nonlinear vibration isolation system in the paper and the harmonic balance method was applied to investigate the primary resonance near the natural frequency of the system.
