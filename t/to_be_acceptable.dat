5|$|As the TR-1 engines {{originally}} {{intended for the}} Su-9 were not yet ready for flight testing in late 1945, Pavel Sukhoi suggested substituting a pair of Jumo 004 engines and this was approved on 15 December. The full-scale mockup was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> on 16 February 1946 and the Council of People's Commissars issued an order on 26 February that the manufacturer's flight testing was to begin on 1 November. This goal was not met because the OKB was heavily committed to other projects like the trainer version of the Tupolev Tu-2 bomber, inexperience with JATO units, and late delivery of RD-10 engines. The first prototype was completed in mid-October and made its first flight on 13 November. The test pilots found the aircraft easy to fly, but the control forces were very high at speed and it lacked enough directional stability. Enlarging the vertical stabilizer cured this last problem and hydraulic boosters were fitted for the control system.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of decompression sickness {{are known to}} be caused by damage resulting from the formation and growth of bubbles of inert gas within the tissues and by blockage of arterial blood supply to tissues by gas bubbles and other emboli consequential to bubble formation and tissue damage. The precise mechanisms of bubble formation and the damage they cause {{has been the subject of}} medical research for a considerable time and several hypotheses have been advanced and tested. Tables and algorithms for predicting the outcome of decompression schedules for specified hyperbaric exposures have been proposed, tested, and used, and usually found to be of some use but not entirely reliable. Decompression remains a procedure with some risk, but this has been reduced and is generally considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> for dives within the well-tested range of commercial, military and recreational diving.|$|E
5|$|On June 20, 1992, at {{the onset}} of the 1992 NHL Entry Draft, the Nordiques entered into a verbal {{agreement}} on a trade involving Lindros with the Flyers. The trade was contingent on Lindros agreeing to play in Philadelphia. The Nordiques permitted Russ Farwell, the general manager of the Flyers, to call Lindros to discuss whether or not Lindros would be willing to play for the Flyers, and he received assurance that Lindros considered Philadelphia <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable.</b> Within 80 minutes of agreeing to a trade with Farwell, Marcel Aubut, the president of the Nordiques, had second thoughts about the trade with Philadelphia and verbally agreed to trade Lindros to the New York Rangers. The Flyers offer was reported to include Mike Ricci, Rod Brind'Amour, Mark Recchi, Steve Duchesne, Ron Hextall, Dominic Roussel, multiple first-round draft picks, and $15million, while the Rangers had reportedly agreed to trade Sergei Nemchinov, Tony Amonte, Alexei Kovalev, James Patrick, and either John Vanbiesbrouck or Mike Richter, as well as multiple first-round draft picks and $20million.|$|E
40|$|This paper <b>is</b> {{the first}} <b>to</b> explore {{the impact of}} culture on the {{acceptability}} of workplace bullying {{and to do so}} across a wide range of countries. Physically intimidating bullying <b>is</b> less <b>acceptable</b> than work related bullying both within groups of similar cultures and globally. Cultures with high performance orientation find bullying <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>acceptable</b> while those with high future orientation find bullying <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less <b>acceptable.</b> A high humane orientation is associated with finding work related bullying <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less <b>acceptable.</b> Confucian Asia finds work-related bullying <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>acceptable</b> than the Anglo, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa country clusters and finds physically intimidating bullying <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>acceptable</b> than the Anglo and Latin America country clusters. The differences in the acceptability of bullying with respect <b>to</b> these cultures <b>are</b> partially explained in terms of cultural dimensions. Department of Management and Marketin...|$|R

5|$|Once {{the right}} to be {{identified}} has been asserted, it applies for the duration of copyright, but only for works created after 1 August 1989. If the right is then infringed, the author or director has legal recourse. For {{the right to}} be infringed, the author must show that they have not been properly identified, that this was in circumstances where the work should have been attributed, and that none of the exceptions or defences apply. In regards to the lack of proper identification, for identification <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> the name of the author must appear in each copy of the work in a prominent fashion, under Section 77(7) of the 1988 Act; where it is not appropriate for the author's name to appear on each copy, it must appear in a fashion that brings their identity to the attention of any person using or acquiring a copy of the work. If the work is a building, the name must be visible to people entering or approaching it. If the author specifies a pseudonym or some other form of identification when asserting the right of attribution, that form of identification should be adopted.|$|E

25|$|In {{professional}} scuba diving, solo diving {{has always}} been considered an option when it is most appropriate to the operational requirements and the risks have been assessed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> under the circumstances. However, this usually involves voice or line communications with the surface control point, and a surface standby diver available {{to go to the}} assistance of the working diver at very short notice. These options are seldom available to the recreational diver.|$|E
25|$|Acceptability {{is about}} the {{performance}} of speakers, that is, the actual use of their language in concrete situations. As stressed by Chomsky, acceptability does not mean grammaticality: while an acceptable sentence must be grammatical, a grammatical sentence does not need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable.</b> For a sentence to be judged acceptable, it must also appear natural and appropriate in a given context, be easily understood and, possibly, be {{to a certain extent}} conventionalised.|$|E

Equally, traders may offer to accept payment in foreign currency, such as Euro, Yen or US Dollars. Acceptability as a means of payment is essentially a matter for agreement between the parties involved.|$|E
25|$|Between Abrahams’ {{visit to}} Nyasaland and the {{publication}} of his report, Edmund Richards, the governor from 1942 to 1947, strongly advocated to the Colonial Office that the Nyasaland government should purchase the Magomero estare of A L Bruce Estates, a single block of approximately 162,000 acres surrounded by very congested areas of Native Trust Land. The Colonial Office was only prepared to allow the Nyasaland government to offer five shillings an acre, a high price for land which had been over-used and deforested, but too low <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> to the owner.|$|E
25|$|Knot: Some of {{the most}} common knots are the Four-in-hand, the Half-Windsor, the Windsor (often called a Full-Windsor or Double-Windsor to {{distinguish}} it from the half-Windsor) and the Shelby or Pratt. A Four-in-hand, Half-Windsor, or Windsor is generally the most appropriate with a suit, particularly by contemporary guidelines. Once properly knotted and arranged, the bottom of the tie can extend anywhere from the wearer's navel level, to slightly below the waistband. The thin end should not extend below the wide end, though this can occasionally be seen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> with thin ties.|$|E

This was later shortened to rage, as this was deemed more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> to the ABC board.

25|$|Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism in North America and Liberal Judaism in the United Kingdom view {{homosexuality}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> on {{the same}} basis as heterosexuality. Progressive Jewish authorities believe either that traditional laws against homosexuality are no longer binding or that {{they are subject to}} changes that reflect a new understanding of human sexuality. Some of these authorities rely on modern biblical scholarship suggesting that the prohibition in the Torah was intended to ban coercive or ritualized homosexual sex, such as those practices ascribed to Egyptian and Canaanite fertility cults and temple prostitution.|$|E
25|$|The {{successful}} {{resistance in}} the Great Siege is attributed to several factors: the improvement in fortifications by Colonel (later General Sir) William Green in 1769; the British naval supremacy, which translated into support of the Navy; the competent command by General George Augustus Elliot; and an appropriately sized garrison. As {{in the early years}} of the British period, during the Siege the British Government considered to exchange Gibraltar for some Spanish possession. However, by the end of the Siege the fortress and its heroic response to the siege was now acquiring a sort of cult status amongst the population in Britain and no exchange however attractive, was likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{principles}} of Dhamma were formulated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> to people belonging to different communities and following any religion. Dhamma {{was not given}} any formal definition or structure. It emphasized tolerance of people {{and the notion of}} showing consideration towards slaves and servants; there is stress on obedience to elders; generosity towards the needy, Brahmans and Sarmanas. Ashoka pleaded for tolerance of different religious sects in an attempt {{to create a sense of}} harmony. The policy of Dhamma also laid stress on non-violence, which was to be practiced by giving up war and conquests and also as a restraint on the killing of animals. However, Ashoka realized that a certain display of his political might may be necessary to keep the primitive forest-dwelling tribes in check.|$|E
25|$|The {{officers}} and {{men of the}} New Model Army drew-up the Solemn Engagement on 29 May 1647.

On 3 June Cornet George Joyce (a junior officer in Fairfax's horse) removed Charles I from the custody of Parliament and placed him under the custody of the Army. On 8 June General Fairfax sent the Solemn Engagement to Parliament along with a letter explaining that as the King was now in the custody of the Army negotiations would be conducted through Army representatives, which made the Army the most powerful political party in the realm.|$|E
