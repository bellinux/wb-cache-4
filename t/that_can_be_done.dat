5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E

25|$|Other tests <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> are chest X-ray, echocardiogram, CT scan, and {{magnetic}} resonance image scan, which via a magnetic field can produce images whose detail helps diagnose muscular dystrophy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{deformable}} bodies such as cloth simulation, {{it may not be}} possible to use a more specific pairwise pruning algorithm as discussed below, and an n-body pruning algorithm is the best <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fractography is {{the study}} of {{fractured}} surfaces <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> on a light microscope or, commonly, on an SEM. The fractured surface is cut to a suitable size, cleaned of any organic residues, and mounted on a specimen holder for viewing in the SEM.|$|E

25|$|When the Carnot {{cycle is}} plotted on a {{pressure}} volume diagram, the isothermal stages follow the isotherm lines {{for the working}} fluid, adiabatic stages move between isotherms and the area bounded by the complete cycle path represents the total work <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> during one cycle.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} options {{available}} to prevent infestation. Many of the precursors drawing the flies initially are sanitary problems which is where control measures are directed. Drenching, shearing or crutching are some basic procedures <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> Crutching is the trimming of excess wool from the breech area, and the timing of both shearing and crutching is critical in {{reducing the amount of}} flystrike.|$|E
25|$|Eliot doesn't return Philip's calls; when Jerene meets Philip for a drink, {{she admits}} {{there is not}} much <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> Later, Philip talks to his friend Brad. He then gets really drunk out on the town to forget. A few days later, he meets Rob in a bar and they return to the boy's dorm room where they have sex. Subsequently, Philip does not return his calls.|$|E

25|$|Combat in GURPS is {{organized}} in personal turns: i.e., every character gets a turn each second, and during {{his or her}} character's turn {{he or she may}} take an action, such as attack or move. After all characters have taken their action, one second has elapsed. Free actions are simple actions <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> at any time. Characters in a party have a set initiative that is entirely based upon their Basic Speed characteristic.|$|E
25|$|This {{last point}} is very {{difficult}} to prove. Before the Ediacaran, the biostratigraphic markers usually used to correlate rocks are absent; therefore {{there is no way to}} prove that rocks in different places across the globe were deposited at precisely the same time. The best <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> is to estimate the age of the rocks using radiometric methods, which are rarely accurate to better than a million years or so.|$|E
25|$|The firm {{collects}} {{ideas from}} a client’s executives, front-line workers, or other departments and staff. The ideas are culled through based on three criterion: {{they must be}} cost-free, easy to try and something <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> quickly. The remaining ideas are tested by statisticians in phases {{to find out which}} ideas {{have a positive impact on}} the output and which combinations of ideas have a greater effect. Out of 150,000 ideas that have been tested by QualPro, 53 percent have no significant impact, 22 percent make things worse and 25 percent result in improvements.|$|E

25|$|A similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a {{multistage}} evaporative cooler. The air {{is passed}} through a spray of salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a spray of water solution to cool it, then another salt solution to dehumidify it again. The brine has to be regenerated, and <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> economically with a low temperature solar still. Multiphase evaporative coolers can lower the air's temperature by 50°F (28°C), and still control humidity. If the brine regenerator uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.|$|E
25|$|Phase I {{consists}} of {{the reconstruction of the}} Harvard Street Railroad Bridge in Medford and the Medford Street Railroad Bridge in Somerville as well as the demolition of the MBTA facility at 21 Water Street in Cambridge. The MBTA opened bid solicitations for Phase I construction elements, which represent preliminary work <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> while the main project is in final design, in July 2012. The work includes the $15.3 million reconstruction of the two railroad bridges, as well as the $3 million demolition. Phase I work was to last until early 2015.|$|E
25|$|Eli goes on {{to train}} Samuel. When Samuel hears God {{speaking}} to him, he at first thinks it is Eli; Eli, who doesn't hear God calling Samuel, eventually realizes the truth, and instructs Samuel on how to respond. Samuel is told that God's threat (which isn't elaborated further) {{will be carried out}} on Eli and his family, and that there is nothing <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to prevent it. Eli asks Samuel what he had been told, insisting that he be told the whole truth, and so Samuel does; Eli reacts by saying that God will do as he judges best.|$|E

25|$|Erythromelalgia is a {{difficult}} condition to diagnose as there are no specific tests available. However, reduced capillary density has been observed microscopically during flaring; and reduced capillary perfusion is noted in the patient. Another test <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> {{is to have the}} patient elevate their legs, and note the reversal (from red to pale) in skin color. Tests done at universities include quantitative sensory nerve testing, laser evoked potentials, sweat testing and epidermal sensory nerve fiber density test (which is an objective test for small fiber sensory neuropathy). Due the aforementioned factors, patients may face delays in diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|To be able {{to perform}} a proper {{diagnosis}} of this pathogen is it important to take samples from the suspected infected individuals such as a stool, throat, or nasopharyngeal sample. There are various tests <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> on these samples to see if a person is infected. Viral antigen can be detected by performing an assay. A serological assay can also be performed on the sample to look for virus-specific antibodies present in the sample, thus showing that the person is trying to combat the virus. The virus can be isolated in culture through the use of mouse-L fibroblasts, green monkey kidney cells, as well as HeLa cells.|$|E
25|$|A {{demand for}} control {{of this process is}} based on the {{principle}} of caution and effective control measures are regarded as necessary. However this faces problems that are not negligible. To separate the “pure” dingo from other domestic dogs is difficult, if it is possible at all. The costs would be enormous, and even if all hybrids are destroyed, there are currently no methods to tests the dingoes in the field. Furthermore, control measures usually do not discriminate between dingoes and other domestic dogs. According to the biologist David Jenkins from the Australian National University there is little <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to reverse the process of interbreeding. Even if selectively searching for hybrids during the killings, it would only disrupt the pack structure and therefore affect the breeding rate of the dogs.|$|E
