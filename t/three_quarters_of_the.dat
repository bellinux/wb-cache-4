5|$|Arévalo {{took office}} on 15 March 1945, inheriting {{a country with}} {{numerous}} social and economic issues. Despite Ubico's policy of using unpaid labor to build public roads, internal transport was severely inadequate. 70% {{of the population was}} illiterate, and malnutrition and poor health were widespread. The wealthiest 2% of landowners owned nearly three quarters of agricultural land, and as a result less than 1% was cultivated. The indigenous peasants either had no land, or had far too little to sustain themselves. <b>Three</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> labor force were in agriculture, and industry was essentially nonexistent.|$|E

This urban sprawl does not only affect the plateau but also the Jura and the Alpine foothills and there are growing concerns about land use.

50|$|The Finance Business Daily (Poslovni dnevnik Finance; Finance meaning Finances) is {{the only}} daily Slovenian {{business}} and financial newspaper. The idea to publish {{it had already been}} proposed by Iztok Jurančič before 1991, when Slovenia declared its independence. However, it was realized only in 1992. At first, the newspaper was published by the company Gospodarski Vestnik. Today, it is published by the Časnik Finance company, which is owned by the Swedish Bonnier Group and also publishes several other publications; for example, the magazines Manager and Moje finance, the healthcare newspaper Medicina danes, and the web portals Finance and Mojevro.

5|$|Like other newts, Triturus species {{develop in}} the water as larvae, and return to it each year for breeding. Adults spend one half to <b>three</b> <b>quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year on land, {{depending}} on the species, and thus depend on both suitable aquatic breeding sites and terrestrial habitats. After larval development in the first year, juveniles pass another year or two before reaching maturity; {{in the north and}} at higher elevations, this can take longer. The larval and juvenile stages are the riskiest for the newts, while survival is higher in adults. Once the risky stages passed, adult newts usually attain an age of seven to nine years, although individuals of the northern crested newts have reached 17 years in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Oil and gas {{were first}} landed in 1978 at Sullom Voe, which has {{subsequently}} {{become one of}} the largest terminals in Europe.
