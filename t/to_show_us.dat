William Bibbiani of Crave Online said, [...] "The short {{is largely}} a success: [...] Hernandez, [...] Bradford and [...] Caplan are all in fine form although, [...] Welliver seems saddled with a little awkward dialogue, {{particularly}} in regards to Coulson, which doesn’t entirely sell." [...] Spencer Terry of Superhero Hype! said, [...] " [...] is easily the best one they've done, and I think that {{can be attributed to}} its length seeing as it's three times longer than the other One-Shots. With a longer run time, the short film doesn't have to rush <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>us</b> everything that it wants to - we get a clear understanding of both the S.H.I.E.L.D. perspective of the events and the robbers' point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|The villain in the story, Mad Wayne, {{had been}} dealt a bad hand in life. Because of his situation, he acts on his bad impulses. Carter elaborated, [...] "Is it fate that Wayne is about, the character, {{this is what}} I was {{interested}} in exploring here. As we'll see with the introduction {{in a moment of}} a character who throws all of this into question – God – we're going to see what his place is in all of this, or at least explore what Burt Reynolds, playing God here, {{has to do with the}} character Wayne." [...] The main idea behind the episode, was that God knows all the numbers, because they are his numbers and he is laying them down and is in [...] "charge of the big game". Being that God is trying <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>us</b> the game, as it was a [...] "game" [...] to be [...] "won or lost", and Wayne has lost this game.|$|E

500|$|R.E.M.'s early {{breakthrough}} success {{served as}} an inspiration for other alternative bands. Spin referred to the [...] "R.E.M. model"—career decisions that R.E.M. made which set guidelines for other underground artists to follow in their own careers. Spin's Charles Aaron wrote that by 1985, [...] "They'd shown how far an underground, punk-inspired rock band could go within the industry without whoring out its artistic integrity in any obvious way. They'd {{figured out how to}} buy in, not sellout-in other words, they'd achieved the American Bohemian Dream." [...] Steve Wynn of Dream Syndicate said, [...] "They invented a whole new ballgame for all of the other bands to follow whether it was Sonic Youth or the Replacements or Nirvana or Butthole Surfers. R.E.M. staked the claim. Musically, the bands did different things, but R.E.M. was first <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>us</b> you can be big and still be cool." [...] Biographer David Buckley stated that between 1991 and 1994, a period that saw the band sell an estimated 30 million albums, R.E.M. [...] "asserted themselves as rivals to U2 for the title of biggest rock band in the world." [...] Over the course of its career, the band has sold over 85 million records worldwide.|$|E
500|$|One of Aden's {{most notable}} storylines {{highlighted}} {{the issue of}} sexual abuse. In the story Aden struggles {{to cope with the}} sexual abuse inflicted on him by his grandfather. Lasance and the serial's writing team worked hard to raise awareness of the [...] "taboo issue". Lasance said he felt he had to do the storyline [...] "one hundred percent justice" [...] because there are people, [...] "more than we probably realise" [...] in real life who have suffered the same as Aden. He felt it was a challenge to play as he did not want victims to think it was unrealistic. Lasance said he had to come onto set each morning in Aden's frame of mind. To research Aden's storyline, he spoke to a relative who had been through a similar situation. He drew inspiration for his portrayal from how his relative had coped and the effects it had on him growing up. Lasance said like his relative, Aden goes though [...] "the huge rebellion years" [...] and the subsequent attempts to [...] "reconnect with those people who had betrayed you." [...] Lasance also received extra training from an acting coach, where he used [...] "haunting" [...] techniques to make himself feel vulnerable like Aden. He also used the storyline <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>US</b> agents his acting abilities.|$|E
500|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times {{called it}} [...] "a true movie milestone, {{presenting}} awe- and fear-inspiring sights {{never before seen}} on the screen... On paper, this story is tailor-made for Mr. Spielberg's talents... t becomes less crisp on screen than {{it was on the}} page, with much of the enjoyable jargon either mumbled confusingly or otherwise thrown away." [...] In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers described the film as [...] "colossal entertainment—the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year [...] Compared with the dinos, the characters are dry bones, indeed. Crichton and co-screenwriter David Koepp have flattened them into nonentities on the trip from page to screen." [...] Roger Ebert noted, [...] "The movie delivers all too well on its promise <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>us</b> dinosaurs. We see them early and often, and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, but the movie is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values." [...] Henry Sheehan argued, [...] "The complaints over Jurassic Parks lack of story and character sound a little off the point," [...] pointing out the story arc of Grant learning to protect Hammond's grandchildren despite his initial dislike of them. Empire magazine gave the film five stars, hailing it as [...] "quite simply one of the greatest blockbusters of all time." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Three Men and Adena" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews and}} {{has been described as}} one of the [...] "classic episodes" [...] of Homicide: Life on the Street. [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] ranked number 74 in an Entertainment Weekly list of the 100 greatest television moments, and number 15 among the top television moments from the 1990s. It was also identified by The Baltimore Sun as one of the ten best episodes of the series. Sun writer David Zurawik said Fontana's playwriting background was deeply infused in the episode, which he called a [...] "landmark hour" [...] that it [...] "put (three men) and a few sticks of battle-scarred, municipal-green furniture and somehow managed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>us</b> the human soul and the heart of darkness". Additionally, [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] was among a 1999 Court TV marathon of the top 15 Homicide episodes, as voted on by 20,000 visitors to the channels website. David Bianculli of the New York Daily News said the episode [...] "remains one of TV's best drama hours ever", and he ranked it the second-best television episode ever made, behind the Taxi episode where Reverend Jim gets his driver's license. Entertainment Weekly writer Bruce Fretts said the episode was [...] "one of the most powerful prime-time hours ever" [...] and called Andre Braugher's performance a [...] "tour de police force". Alex Strachan of The Vancouver Sun described [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] as [...] "one of Homicides finest moments". He called the episode [...] "claustrophobic, cynical and ultimately painful" [...] and particularly praised the performances of Braugher and Secor, {{and the fact that it}} was not a happy ending. David P. Kalat, writer of Homicide: Life on the Street: The Unofficial Companion, described the episode as [...] "an astonishing tour de force of writing and acting that demonstrates all of Homicides best qualities". He also praised the chemistry between Braugher and Secor, particularly when they found a common voice during the interrogation.|$|E
500|$|Benedict de Spinoza in his Ethics, {{published}} {{after his}} death in 1677, argued that most people, even those that consider themselves to exercise free will, make moral decisions on the basis of imperfect sensory information, inadequate understanding of their mind and will, as well as emotions which are both outcomes of their contingent physical existence and forms of thought defective from being chiefly impelled by self-preservation. The solution, according to Spinoza, was to gradually increase the capacity of our reason to change the forms of thought produced by emotions and {{to fall in love with}} viewing problems requiring moral decision from the perspective of eternity. Thus, living a life of peaceful conscience means to Spinoza that reason is used to generate adequate ideas where the mind increasingly sees the world and its conflicts, our desires and passions sub specie aeternitatis, that is without reference to time. Hegel's obscure and mystical Philosophy of Mind held that the absolute right of freedom of conscience facilitates human understanding of an all-embracing unity, an absolute which was rational, real and true. Nevertheless, Hegel thought that a functioning State would always be tempted not to recognize conscience in its form of subjective knowledge, just as similar non-objective opinions are generally rejected in science. A similar idealist notion was expressed in the writings of Joseph Butler who argued that conscience is God-given, should always be obeyed, is intuitive, and should be considered the [...] "constitutional monarch" [...] and the [...] "universal moral faculty": [...] "conscience does not only offer itself <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>us</b> the way we should walk in, but it likewise carries its own authority with it." [...] Butler advanced ethical speculation by referring to a duality of regulative principles in human nature: first,"self-love" [...] (seeking individual happiness) and second, [...] "benevolence" [...] (compassion and seeking good for another) in conscience (also linked to the agape of situational ethics). Conscience tended to be more authoritative in questions of moral judgment, thought Butler, because it was more likely to be clear and certain (whereas calculations of self-interest tended to probable and changing conclusions). John Selden in his Table Talk expressed the view that an awake but excessively scrupulous or ill-trained conscience could hinder resolve and practical action; it being [...] "like a horse that is not well wayed, he starts at every bird that flies out of the hedge".|$|E
