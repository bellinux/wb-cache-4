2500|$|Unlike other {{air-cooled}} cars (such as the Volkswagen Beetle and the Fiat 500) the 2CV's engine had no <b>thermostat</b> <b>valve</b> in its oil system. The engine {{needed more}} time for oil to reach normal operating temperature in cold weather. All the oil passed through an oil cooler behind the fan and received the full cooling effect regardless of the ambient temperature. This removes the risk of overheating from a jammed thermostat that can afflict water- and air-cooled engines and the engine can withstand many hours of running under heavy load at high engine speeds even in hot weather. To prevent the engine running cool in cold weather (and to improve {{the output of the}} cabin heater) all 2CVs were supplied with a grille blind (canvas on early cars and a clip-on plastic item called a [...] "muff" [...] in the owner's handbook, on later ones) which blocked around half the aperture to reduce the flow of air to the engine.|$|E
40|$|The {{automotive}} {{cooling system}} has unrealized potential to improve {{internal combustion engine}} performance through enhanced coolant temperature control and reduced parasitic losses. Advanced automotive thermal management systems use controllable actuators (e. g., smart <b>thermostat</b> <b>valve,</b> variable speed water pump, and electric radiator fan) that must work in harmony to control engine temperature. One important area of cooling system operation is warm-up, during which fluid flow is regulated between the bypass and radiator loops. A fundamental question arises regarding {{the usefulness of the}} common <b>thermostat</b> <b>valve.</b> In this paper, four different thermostat configurations have been analyzed, with accompanying linear and nonlinear control algorithms, to investigate warm-up behaviors and <b>thermostat</b> <b>valve</b> operations. The configurations considered include factory, two-way valve, three-way valve, and no valve. Representative experimental testing was conducted on a steam-based thermal bench to examine the effectiveness of each valve configuration in the engine cooling system. The results clearly demonstrate that the three-way valve has the best performance as noted by the excellent warm-up time, temperature tracking, and cooling system power consumption. 1...|$|E

40|$|In {{future and}} also in the present time, with the focus on {{minimizing}} environmental impacts, the truck industry faces a big technological challenge in terms of meeting statutory emission legislations and also on satisfying the ever increasing demand of customers in terms of minimizing the fuel consumption. There are other challenges in terms of having a short development time and reducing the overall development cost. All the above stated challenges requires measures in terms of how computer simulations can be used to better represent a system, how different concepts can be tested, how the overall system can be tested in particular system working environment which ultimately will give a short development time with minimum cost. This thesis work basically answers the above questions in a holistic manner by considering how the truck cooling system be modeled using different CFD tools like AMESim and GT Cool to understand how different performance parameters of a cooling system vary for a steady and transient driving cycle. In this thesis work, the cooling system model has been developed for an ongoing project in Volvo Powertrain AB. The model has been developed for 16 L DST, 750 Hp, Euro 6 heavy duty truck engine with other auxiliary components like, air compressor, transmission oil cooler, cab heater, urea heater to mention a few. The model has been developed such that it can run on both steady and transient cycles by changing few elements in terms of how the input is given to the model. One of the aims of this thesis work was to evaluate the two tools mentioned above in terms of workability, implementability and reliability. Results in terms of pressure drop, mass flow rate, heat transfer rate, <b>thermostat</b> <b>valve</b> fluctuation etc. have been compared for above mentioned tools. It is pointed out that since the model has been developed for an ongoing project, the validation of the model by performing actual tests couldn’t be performed because of the unavailability of the engine.

40|$|The 2015 climate {{summit in}} Paris {{has shown the}} {{dedication}} of countries {{all over the world}} to prevent “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”, [13]. The decision has been made, that exceeding the limit of a 2 degree Celsius increase in average world temperature compared to 1990 levels has to be avoided. Germany has been on the front of reducing its carbon footprint with its ’Energiewende’. The reduction of the energy consumption in the residential building sector plays a vital role in the country’s policies, as the residential building accounts for 26 % of the final energy consumption [42]. The goal of the TABULA project is to categorise the residential building stock, [47]. This research uses the TABULA project to determine the potential energy savings and corresponding CO 2 emission reductions as a result of retrofit application of building automation systems in single family houses (SFH). Building automation systems (BAS), and in particular automatic regulating heating systems in residential homes could play a role. In this research a Modelica [60] based residential building model (RBM) has been developed to simulate the automatic regulation of a central heating system in SFHs. Two BAS scenarios are considered and applied to three Stand Alone Houses (SAHs). The imple- mentation of a time schedule thermostat that automatically reduces the set temperature when the residents are not occupying the building, and a self regulating <b>thermostat</b> <b>valve</b> that reduces the heat transmission in the room during manual ventilation over the windows. Implementing scenario 1 BAS for the SAHs would lead to an annual final energy reduction of 10 % for SAH 1, 11 % for SAH 2 and 14 % for SAH 3. The corresponding annual primary energy reduction on the German building stock level results to 58 PJ. This would lead to a reduction of the CO 2 emissions by 3. 1 Mt CO 2 on yearly basis. The RBM has a dual functionality of assessing both the indoor climate conditions over the course of a year as well as the annual final energy consumption for space heating. Regulating the indoor set temperature requires a relatively high load during reheating periods compared to constant operation. The research shows the importance of a sufficient nominal load of the heating system to ensure the thermal comfort of the residents in winter. The annual final energy saving potential for scenario 2 BAS (self regulation thermostat valves) in SAH 3 is 4 %, under minimal ventilation conditions. However, the results of the RBM have shown that different ventilation rates could influence this result significantly. Further simulations with the RBM could extend the results here to all SFHs and determine their combined potential in the future...|$|E
40|$|The work {{investigates the}} {{integration}} between tools for analysis and simulation of cooling system at Volvo Group Trucks Technology. At {{the same time}} it is a consequent step in evaluating GT-SUITE as a tool for analysis and simulation of cooling systems. The interaction between the truck's cooling system and the engine has so far not been modeled in its entirety in a completely integrated, detailed model capable of simulating transient runs. This work marks the first steps in this direction. A number of different methods for modeling cooling system performance exist. This project focuses on 1 D simulation tools, which are generally preferred in the context of transient simulations of power train and engine installation systems. The Cooling Analysis and Simulations group at Volvo Group Trucks Technology uses KULI as 1 D simulation tool for analysis of cooling performance. Volvo Powetrain, on the other hand, uses GT-SUITE for engine simulations. It is expected {{to improve the quality of}} the simulation, (i. e the accuracy of the results) and improve system integration by using one tool for both areas of simulation. GT-SUITE is a powerful tool for modeling the uid-dynamics and heat-transfer phenomena, which occur in the cooling system. The work includes a detailed model of the main coolant circuit since this is vital for the authenticity of the transient simulation. This thesis is a natural continuation of a project performed by the author during the summer of 2012, which evaluated GT-SUITE as a tool for steady-state simulation of cooling systems[13]. The basic models of the cooler package were developed and calibrated during this project. This work delivers two transient models of FH 13 liter Euro 6 cooling system integrated with a predictive engine model, provided by Volvo Powertrain. As a first step, all necessary models and control algorithms were obtained from different technical units within the organization and were further reworked and refined to fit the purpose of this work. Such are the engine model obtained from BF 66360 System Analysis and Simulation at Volvo Powertrain, the fan control model provided by BF 72362 Cooling Systems at Powertrain Installation and the coolant pump control model from BF 69317 Vehicle Functions. Component performance data was as well acquired for different components within the coolant circuit: <b>thermostat</b> <b>valve,</b> coolant pump, engine oil cooler, etc. GEM 3 D was used to ease the process of creating authentic models of the coolant logistic components (pipes, hoses, owsplits, etc) The first model produced in this work, delivers a basic representation of the physics in the system and its main aim is to prove the technical feasibility of the concept. It includes all necessary functional features : working fan control, coolant pump mode control, function for temperature compensation for the effect of air recirculation. The model was used to obtain critical cooling system-related parameters from Hamburg-Kassel drive cycle and critical parameters were compared to measurements from tests. The results, acquired from the first model have satisfactory consistency with the data from test. Average coefficient of determination achieved by the model is R 2 > 0. 85, which for most of the parameters is higher than the results given by the currently available program for transient simulations. The rate of execution of the model was successfully increased to 1 x Real Time. The second model implements two-way communication between the engine model and the cooling system model: the temperature on the outlet of the CAC and torque consumed by coolant pump and fan are fed back to the engine model and therefore the interaction between the performance of the two separate systems is partially accounted for. Average coefficients of determination achieved from this model are similar to the ones from the model with single connectivity. Execution time rate did not alter significantly in comparison to the previous model. The implemented interaction between the subsystems allows for a predictive model of the boost temperature and investigations on fuel economy. The work has proven the feasibility and the integrability of an engine model and a model of a cooling system in GT being controlled in Simulink environment. This paper can be seen as a comprehensive manual to building, tuning and executing such a model...|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} use, however, is {{probably}} in vehicles. It {{is used in}} door seals, window seals, trunk seals, and sometimes hood seals.
