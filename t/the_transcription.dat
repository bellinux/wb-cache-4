5|$|About 1500 {{genes are}} linked to {{outcomes}} in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

5|$|In contrast, other {{proteins}} {{have evolved}} to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. <b>The</b> <b>transcription</b> factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription. Alternatively, transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.|$|E
30|$|The {{result of}} {{applying}} the statistical model to CETEMPúblico vocabulary was fairly accurate, although with some significant flaws. Then, we followed a long procedure of manual verification and correction of <b>the</b> <b>transcriptions.</b> <b>The</b> {{next step was}} to compare <b>the</b> <b>transcriptions</b> with other ones, generated by a commercial speech synthesizer.

5|$|In {{order to}} control which genes are being transcribed, the cell {{separates}} some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical {{access to the}} DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, {{in the case of}} NF-κB-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-α, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> factor NF-κB. A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-κB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> of the target genes.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{polyadenylation}} begins as <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> {{of a gene}} terminates.

In some genes these proteins add a poly(A) tail at one of several possible sites. Therefore, polyadenylation can produce more than one transcript from a single gene (alternative polyadenylation), similar to alternative splicing.|$|E

5|$|Ensuring a plasmid accepts {{an insert}} {{is a common}} problem of DNA cloning. Toxin-antitoxin systems {{can be used to}} {{positively}} select for only those cells that have taken up a plasmid containing the inserted gene of interest, screening out those that lack the inserted gene. An example of this application comes from CcdB-encoded toxin, which has been incorporated into plasmid vectors. The gene of interest is then targeted to recombine into the CcdB locus, inactivating <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> of the toxic protein. Thus, cells containing the plasmid but not the insert perish due to the toxic effects of CcdB protein, and only those that incorporate the insert survive.|$|E

40|$|Background: In recent years, {{analyses}} of cleft palate speech based on phonetic transcriptions have become common. However, the results vary considerably among different studies. It {{cannot be excluded}} that differences in assessment methodology, including the recording medium, influence the results. Aims: To compare phonetic transcriptions from audio and audio/video recordings of cleft palate speech by means of outcomes of per cent correct consonants (PCC) and differences in consonant transcriptions. Methods & Procedures: Thirty-two 3 -year-olds born with cleft palate were audio and audio/video recorded while performing a single-word test by picture naming. The recordings were transcribed according to the International Phonetic Alphabet. <b>The</b> <b>transcriptions</b> from <b>the</b> audio and the audio/video recordings were analysed with regard to PCC, differences {{in the use of}} phonetic consonant symbols and the use of diacritics. Outcomes & Results: PCC was higher when the calculation was based on transcriptions from audio recordings than when based on audio/video recordings. No such differences were seen when age-appropriate consonant processes were scored as correct. Consonants were not excluded as often in <b>the</b> <b>transcriptions</b> from audio/video recordings as they were in <b>the</b> <b>transcriptions</b> from audio recordings, and more target consonants were transcribed as dental/alveolar in <b>the</b> <b>transcriptions</b> from audio/video recordings and palatal/velar/uvular in <b>the</b> <b>transcriptions</b> from audio recordings than vice versa. Further, interdental articulation, linguolabial articulation and audible nasal air leakage were more common in <b>the</b> <b>transcriptions</b> from audio/video recordings than in those from audio recordings. All these differences were statistically significant. Conclusions & Implications: Phonetic transcription is influenced to some extent by visual cues. However, as long as age-appropriate articulatory and phonological simplification processes are scored as correct when evaluating consonant production in the speech of young children born with cleft palate using phonetic <b>transcription,</b> <b>the</b> recording medium does not seem to affect the results...|$|R

5|$|Many prokaryotic {{genes are}} {{organized}} into operons, with multiple protein-coding sequences that are transcribed as a unit. The genes in an operon are transcribed {{as a continuous}} messenger RNA, {{referred to as a}} polycistronic mRNA. The term cistron in this context is equivalent to gene. <b>The</b> <b>transcription</b> of an operon’s mRNA is often controlled by a repressor that can occur in an active or inactive state depending on the presence of certain specific metabolites. When active, the repressor binds to a DNA sequence {{at the beginning of the}} operon, called the operator region, and represses transcription of the operon; when the repressor is inactive transcription of the operon can occur (see e.g. Lac operon). The products of operon genes typically have related functions and are involved in the same regulatory network.|$|E
