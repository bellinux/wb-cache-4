50|$|Radial force {{variation}} or {{road force}} variation (RFV) is a property of a tire that affects steering, <b>traction,</b> <b>braking</b> and load support. High values of RFV {{for a given}} tire reflect {{a high level of}} manufacturing variations in the tire structure that will impart ride disturbances into the vehicle in the vertical direction.

The circuit will be de-energised by a number of events, such as the driver releasing a vigilance control, applying an emergency brake or passing a signal at stop. This will cause the train to apply all brakes.|$|R

To estimate the roll angle, this paper proposes a method that employs a reduced set of sensors with respect to existing solutions; namely, two accelerometers and a gyroscope are needed. Notably, {{it does not require}} the knowledge of the speed signal, which can be unavailable and/or affected by significant uncertainties when large accelerations/decelerations occur.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} {{longitudinal}} <b>traction</b> (<b>braking</b> and acceleration) of rubber-tired ground vehicles using techniques from nonlinear dy-namics. Two types of vehicle traction models are considered: single-wheel (quarter-car) models and two-wheel (half-car) models. In these problems it is customary and quite nat-ural {{to take as}} dynamic states the forward vehi-cle speed and the absolute rotational rate of each tire/wheel. However, an alternative formulation is motivated where wheel slip—a dimensionless mea-sure {{of the difference between}} the vehicle speed and the circumferential speed of a particular tire relative to its center—replaces the angular velocity of each tire/wheel as a dynamic state. By using these state...|$|R
50|$|When the {{traction}} control computer (often incorporated into another control unit, {{such as the}} ABS module) detects one or more driven wheels spinning significantly faster than another, it invokes the ABS electronic control unit to apply brake friction to wheels spinning with lessened <b>traction.</b> <b>Braking</b> action on slipping wheel(s) will cause power transfer to wheel axle(s) with traction due to the mechanical action within the differential. All-wheel drive (AWD) vehicles often have an electronically controlled coupling system in the transfer case or transaxle engaged (active part-time AWD), or locked-up tighter (in a true full-time set up driving all wheels with some power all the time) to supply non-slipping wheels with torque.|$|R

50|$|It is {{emphasised}} {{that this}} is a much simplified description of the physics; complicating factors are creep, actual wheel and rail profiles, dynamic effects, stiffness of longitudinal restraint at axleboxes, and the lateral component of longitudinal (<b>traction</b> and <b>braking)</b> forces.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} how a reusable {{motion control}} {{system can be}} designed to handle Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) systems. The design considers simultaneously energy management and vehicle stability control, by distributing the task among available actuators. The suggested control system includes a control law for longitudinal, lateral, and yaw motion and a control distributor which distributes the desired control signals on the available actuators. The distribution among available actuators is designed by using constrained control allocation with mixed optimisation formulation, which gives a smooth blending among the available actuators. Simulations confirm that the proposed motion control system not only works as a <b>traction,</b> <b>braking,</b> and steering controller, it also works well as a vehicle stability controller...|$|R
5000|$|Hydroplaning, {{also known}} as aquaplaning, is the {{condition}} where a layer of water builds up between the tire and road surface. Hydroplaning occurs when the tread pattern cannot channel away enough water at an adequate rate to ensure a semi-dry footprint area. Hydroplaning is more prevalent with wider tires and at higher speeds. When hydroplaning occurs, the tire effectively [...] "floats" [...] above the road surface on a cushion of water - and loses <b>traction,</b> <b>braking</b> and steering, creating a very unsafe driving condition. When hydroplaning occurs, there is considerably less responsiveness of the steering wheel. The correction of this unsafe condition is to gradually reduce speed, by merely lifting off the accelerator/gas pedal.|$|R
40|$|Tyres play a {{key role}} in ground vehicles’ {{dynamics}} because they are responsible for <b>traction,</b> <b>braking</b> and cornering.

The most of nowadays tires have good grip features on ice, but sometimes it’s not enough, especially when talking about the icy road condition. Many factors have significant influence on decrease of tire’s grip – one of them is temperature. The possibilities of using thermography in researches of tire and ice interaction were investigated in this paper. Measurements of tire and ice surfaces temperature were performed at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology with inner drum test bench using an infrared thermal camera. Longitudinal tire <b>traction</b> (<b>braking</b> and accelerating) were investigated and acting forces were measured too.

40|$|In {{the current}} {{practice}} of wagon dynamics simulation, <b>traction</b> and <b>braking</b> forces are seldom considered although such forces modify the wheel-rail contact parameters {{and hence the}} wheelset dynamics. On the other hand, whilst the <b>traction</b> and <b>braking</b> forces are considered in the simulation of train and locomotive systems, their lateral dynamics is predominantly disregarded. Therefore, there exists {{a gap in the}} knowledge of the effect of the application of the longitudinal forces to the lateral dynamics of wagons; this paper aims at bridging this gap. An inertial reference frame method available in the literature has been extended for the purpose.

An experimental system was designed and implemented to verify {{the performance of the}} traction system for a metro train. For a highly accurate control of the system, a hybrid control algorithm combining vector control and slip frequency control was applied to control the traction inverter. The design method of the flywheels, which represent the equivalent model of the train moment inertia, was elaborated. A train runtime diagnosis system was completed by adopting the multifunction vehicle bus (MVB) protocol. The dynamic performance of the metro power traction system was emulated {{under the control of the}} train runtime diagnosis system. Using the combined test rig, the performances of the traction system in <b>traction,</b> <b>braking,</b> temperature rise, etc., were verified through traction and breaking experiments.|$|R
40|$|Longitudinal {{wheel slip}} {{control is a}} crucial problem in {{automotive}} systems, as it it {{is the basis for}} <b>traction,</b> <b>braking</b> and stability control. As slip dynamics are critically dependent on the vehicle speed, it is interesting to devise an adaptation of the controller parameters with respect to this variable. Specifically, slip dynamics get faster and thus more difficult to govern for the rider as speed decreases: hence, at low speed one would willingly lose tracking performance in exchange for increased safety. To achieve this, we propose a novel Switched Second Order Sliding Mode (S-SOSM) control strategy, which allows to enhance the closed-loop performance and to tune them to the current working condition. Specifically, the S-SOSM control problem is formulated and discussed, and its validity assessed on a specific instance of the wheel slip control problem, that is the traction control of two-wheeled vehicles...|$|R
