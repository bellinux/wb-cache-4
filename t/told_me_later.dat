500|$|Wyatt and Holliday {{had been}} fast friends since Holliday saved Earp's life in Dodge City during 1878. During their stay in Albuquerque, {{the two men}} ate at the Retreat Restaurant owned by [...] "Fat Charlie". Otero wrote in his letter, [...] "Holiday said {{something}} about Earp becoming 'a damn Jew-boy.' Earp became angry and left…. [...] Jaffa <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>later</b> that Earp’s woman was a Jewess. Earp did mezuzah when entering the house." [...] Wyatt was staying with prominent businessman Henry N. Jaffa, who was also president of New Albuquerque’s Board of Trade. Jaffa was also Jewish, {{and based on the}} letter, Earp had, while staying in Jaffa’s home, honored Jewish tradition by performing the mezuzah upon entering his home.|$|E

2500|$|I sent {{it out to}} Doubleday {{and they}} refused it. They said, [...] "We asked for a novel." [...] They didn't {{consider}} it a novel. [...] I had to give back my advance. My agent <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>later</b> they called the editor on the carpet for having refused the book— only after they {{saw that it was}} selling fast. It only had to do with sales. They didn't bother to read it.A belated first American edition, by New Directions Publishing, appeared the following month.|$|E
60|$|I {{set it down}} as it was <b>told</b> to <b>me</b> <b>later</b> {{by those}} who bore their share in it, and {{particularly}} by Falcone, who, as you shall learn, came to be a witness of all, and retailed to me the affair with the greatest detail of what this one said and how that one looked.|$|R
5000|$|... “Tabloid,” {{an early}} public affairs program with {{interviews}} and weather forecasts hosted by Percy Saltzman, goes on air in Toronto. “General Motors Theatre,” also out of Toronto, and produced by Sydney Newman, presents original Canadian drama, including Ted Allan’s Lies My Father <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> (which was <b>later</b> adapted into a feature) and Lister Sinclair’s The Blood Is Strong.|$|R
2500|$|My brother, Buddy Wootten, also a bassist, {{called me}} from Atlanta {{to tell me}} he had just {{finished}} working the Fox Theater with Les Paul and Mary Ford. Mary also <b>told</b> <b>me</b> this <b>later.</b> This was while I was holding forth with Woody Herman Orchestra. So, later when I had married her sister (Eva), we worked with her other sister and Bob Summers (her brother) on guitar (sounds like Les Paul too) and Mary's other sister Carol. The gig was the Crescendo club {{right in the middle}} of Sunset Strip. A very hip joint! ...|$|R
2500|$|He co-starred as Humphrey Bogart's younger brother, a {{carefree}} playboy, in Sabrina (1954), {{played by}} Audrey Hepburn. It was Holden's third film with director Billy Wilder. Holden and Hepburn became romantically involved during the filming, unbeknown to Wilder: [...] "People {{on the set}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>later</b> that Bill and Audrey were having an affair, and everybody knew. Well, not everybody! I didn't know." [...] The interactions between Bogart, Hepburn, and Holden made shooting less than pleasant, however, as Bogart originally had wanted his wife, Lauren Bacall, to play Sabrina. While Bogart was, therefore, not especially friendly toward Hepburn, who had little Hollywood experience, Holden's reaction was the opposite, writes biographer Michelangelo Capua.|$|E
2500|$|Conner's plane {{arrived at}} LAX at 4:40 pm {{and he was}} flown by {{helicopter}} to CBS Studios, landing {{by the time of}} a commercial break. After appearing on the show, Conner gave Comăneci his telephone number, but at the time, Comăneci, who was [...] "shy and suspicious of him [...] also sensed that he was being open and honest. For a second, I was tempted to ask for help...I needed to move on and find a better life for myself. Bart <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>later</b> that he tried to call me after the show, but Constantin never let me know of his calls." [...] Of Conner's sudden appearance on the show, Comăneci later commented in her memoir, [...] "There was nothing romantic about [...] motivation. It was based on his desire to help a young woman he'd met once who was an icon in our shared sport." ...|$|E

[...] Jaffa <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>later</b> that Earp’s woman was a Jewess. Earp did mezuzah when entering the house." [...] Earp's anger at Holliday's ethnic slur may indicate that his feelings for Josephine was more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling {{because at the time}} it was written in the 1940s, the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus while living in Tombstone was virtually unknown. The only way Otero could write about these things was if he had a personal relationship with some of the individuals involved. The Earp party split up in Albuquerque, and Holliday and Dan Tipton rode on to Pueblo, while the rest of the group headed for Gunnison.|$|E

She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> a little <b>later</b> (when we found occasion to exchange some words) that he had suddenly announced his intention after a visit from Captain Harris, and her best endeavours, whether to dissuade him from the journey, or to elicit some explanation of its purpose, had alike proved unavailing.|$|R
5000|$|With a {{swath of}} pivotal events in Mueller's life—including her brother's death at age 14, the result of {{climbing}} a dead tree, which collapsed on him in the woods near their home—she went on to pursue her writing, and in high school hung out with the hippie crowd. One of Mueller's idiosyncrasies as a teen was that she constantly dyed her hair: [...] "Whenever you're depressed, just change your hair color," [...] she mother always <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> years <b>later,</b> when I was a teenager: I was never denied a bottle of hair bleach or dye. In my closet there weren't many clothes, but there were tons of bottles." ...|$|R
60|$|Next day Miss Sylvia was her serene, smiling self once more, {{and she did}} {{not again}} make any {{reference}} to what she had <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> A fortnight <b>later</b> she returned home and I went my way back to the world. During the following winter I wrote several letters to Miss Sylvia and received replies from her. Her letters were very like herself. When I sent her the third-rate magazine containing my story--nothing but a third-rate magazine would take it in its rewritten form--she wrote to say that she was so glad that I had let the poor girl know.|$|R
2500|$|Conner's plane {{arrived at}} LAX at 4:40 pm; he was flown by {{helicopter}} to CBS Studios and landed during a commercial break. After {{appearing on the}} show with Comăneci and Panait, Conner met with [...] Comăneci in the green room, later saying of the meeting:I think I can understand why Nadia said what she did ... She said, 'He (Panit) is my manager. We don't have a relationship, so it doesn't matter if he's married or not.' But it came off really awful. She regrets it, and I don't think she realized how misunderstood she would be. She really got burned. She said the Miami media was really not nice to her. Conner gave Comăneci his telephone number, but at the time, Comăneci, who wasshy and suspicious of him [...] also sensed {{that he was being}} open and honest. For a second, I was tempted to ask for help... I needed to move on and find a better life for myself.

60|$|During the {{remainder}} of the journey afoot we met, mayhap, a dozen farmers who lived on our line of march, {{and it seemed to me}} much as if they knew more concerning what the colonists would do in their own behalf than did we, who were so lately come from town. I noted, as also did Archie, so he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>later,</b> that there was an air of anxious expectancy about all these people when, judging from our dress that we had come from Charlestown, or even Boston itself, they questioned us concerning the doings of the Sons of Liberty, the enrollment of Minute Men, and the smuggling of weapons across the Neck.|$|E
60|$|Mortimer Sturgis, as you know, {{had been}} engaged before, but Betty Weston had never {{inspired}} the tumultuous rush of emotion which the mere sight of this girl had set loose in him. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>later</b> that just {{to watch her}} holing out her soup gave him a sort of feeling you get when your drive collides with a rock {{in the middle of}} a tangle of rough and kicks back into the middle of the fairway. If golf had come late in life to Mortimer Sturgis, love came later still, and just as the golf, attacking him in middle life, had been some golf, so was the love considerable love. Mortimer finished his dinner in a trance, which is the best way to do it at some hotels, and then scoured the place for someone who would introduce him. He found such a person eventually and the meeting took place.|$|E
60|$|One night a young American got {{access to}} Stoddard at the Concert Rooms {{and told him}} a moving tale. He said he was living on the Surrey side, and for some strange reason his {{remittances}} had failed to arrive from home; he had no money, {{he was out of}} employment, and friendless; his girl-wife and his new baby were actually suffering for food; for the love of heaven could he lend him a sovereign until his remittances should resume? Stoddard was deeply touched, and gave him a sovereign on my account. Dolby scoffed, but Stoddard stood his ground. Each <b>told</b> <b>me</b> his story <b>later</b> in the evening, and I backed Stoddard's judgment. Dolby said we were women in disguise, and not a sane kind of women, either.|$|R
5000|$|... #1: Vaughn {{was about}} to score his first victory after a bright yellow Pfalz D III took a shot at him. He was shocked and outraged. Breaking formation, Vaughn made a {{climbing}} turn to the right pursuing the Pfalz, and closed the range as the enemy pilot headed east into Germany. His adversary dove as the range continued to close. Vaughn opened fire at 100 yards and expended 200 rounds of ammunition from his Vickers gun. The Pfalz began smoking, fell some 500 feet, and burst into flames. Vaughn would later comment: [...] "I remember my first combat victory. The Pfalz I was engaged with got a long burst into my tail before I knew he was even in the sky. That was a great lesson never to be forgotten, always see the other fellow first and never let him see you first. Fortunately his aim was quite poor and after {{that it was only}} the routine we had learned in combat school. Eventually he turned for home. I chased him, which wasn't {{the right thing to do}} as it turned out. When I finally caught up with him I was quite far into German territory and my flight commander really <b>told</b> <b>me</b> off <b>later,</b> because he didn't relish being pulled that far into Germany just to watch over me. The Pfalz was confirmed by people in the squadron and on the ground. He fell in flames." ...|$|R

6000|$|My babyhood, my childhood, my girlhood, my school-days {{were all}} utterly blotted out by that one strange shock of horror. My past life became exactly {{as though it}} had never been. I forgot my own name. I forgot my mother-tongue. I forgot {{everything}} I had ever done or known or thought about. Except for the power to walk and stand and perform simple actions of every-day use, I became a baby in arms again, with a nurse to take care of me. The doctors <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>later,</b> I had fallen into what they were pleased to call [...] "a Second State." [...] I was examined and reported upon as a Psychological Curiosity. But at the time, I knew nothing of all this. A thunderbolt, as it were, destroyed at one blow every relic, every trace of my previous existence; and I began life all over again, with that terrible scene of blood as my first birthday and practical starting point.|$|E
6000|$|While I was {{studying}} these novel Australian facts, {{in the autumn}} of 1898, a friend, a distinguished member of Clan Diarmaid, passing by my window, in London, saw me, and came in. He at once began to tell me that, in the estuary of the Clyde, and at Dunbuie, some one had found small stones, marked with the same archaic kinds of patterns, [...] "cup-and-ring," [...] half circles, and so forth, as exist on our inscribed rocks, cists, and other large objects. I then showed him the illustrations of portable stones in Australia, with archaic patterns, not then published, but figured in the proof sheets of Messrs. Spencer and Gillen's work. My friend <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>later,</b> that he had seen small stone incised with concentric circles, found in the excavation of a hill fort near Tarbert, in Kintyre. He made a sketch of this object, from memory: if found in Central Australia it would have been reckoned a churinga nanja.|$|E

60|$|Yet a third discovery, and a {{much more}} {{important}} one, came to <b>me</b> <b>later</b> on. A dirty little imp of a boy ran by clothed {{more or less in}} a beautifully worked silk putso, the like of which I had in vain attempted to secure at Rangoon. A bystander <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that such an article would cost one hundred and ten rupees--exactly ten rupees in excess of the price demanded at Rangoon, when I had been discourteous to a pretty Burmese girl with diamonds in her ears, and had treated her as though she were a Delhi boxwallah.|$|R
