40|$|Objective: In {{malnourished}} populations, the weight-for-height Z-score (WHZ) {{distribution is}} {{shifted to the}} left. The aim of nutrition interventions should be <b>to</b> <b>restore</b> <b>a</b> normal WHZ distribution for the whole population. The present paper examines the WHZ change needed by each individual to achieve this objective. Design: We developed a mathematical model of required individual change in WHZ {{as a function of}} characteristics of the initial population <b>to</b> <b>restore</b> <b>a</b> normal distribution. This model was then tested by simulating WHZ change needed <b>to</b> <b>restore</b> <b>a</b> normal WHZ distribution in a test population. Setting: A rural area of Democratic Republic of the Congo with a high prevalence of undernutrition. Subjects: Children under 5 years of age. Results: <b>To</b> <b>restore</b> <b>a</b> normal distribution for the whole population, the WHZ of all children should be shifted. The desired WHZ change of each individual should be higher when the individual’s initial WHZ is low, when the mean WHZ of the whole population is low and, for the most wasted individual, when the variance of WHZ and WHZ change in the population are high. Using the suggested model in a simulation on the test population resulted in a WHZ distribution close to the growth standard. Conclusions: <b>To</b> <b>restore</b> <b>a</b> normal WHZ distribution in wasted populations, nutritional programmes should cover the whole population with a higher weight gain in areas where mean WHZ is low. </p...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{explicit}} scheme to fully recover a multiple-qubit state {{subject to a}} phase damping noise. We establish the theoretical framework and the operational procedure <b>to</b> <b>restore</b> <b>an</b> unknown initial quantum state for an N-qubit model interacting with either individual baths or a common bath. We give an explicit construction of the random unitary (RU) Kraus decomposition for an N-qubit model interacting with a common bath. We also demonstrate how to use only one unitary reversal operation <b>to</b> <b>restore</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary state with phase damping noise. In principle, the initial state can always be recovered with a success probability of 1. Interestingly, we found that non-RU decomposition {{can also be used}} <b>to</b> <b>restore</b> some particular entangled states. This may open <b>a</b> new path <b>to</b> <b>restore</b> <b>a</b> quantum state beyond the standard RU scheme. Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures, Typos and inaccuracies are corrected.
