30|$|The principal’s {{expected}} utilities with a top-down and a participative budgeting {{process are}} increasing in the earnings potential x_H. The relative attractiveness of a top-down and a participative budgeting process is {{captured by the}} cut-off level β ^c. For an importance of coordination below this threshold, the <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process yields a higher expected utility for the principal than a participative budgeting process. For an importance of coordination above the threshold β ^c, the opposite is true. When the earnings potential x_H increases, the principal’s expected utilities with a top-down and a participative budgeting process also increase. The increase is higher with a participative budgeting process than with a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process because of imperfect coordination with a top-down budget. Therefore, the cut-off level β ^c is smaller for a higher earnings potential x_H. The range for which a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process is implemented, i.e., [0,β ^c), becomes smaller when the earnings potential increases. As a consequence, {{an increase in the}} earnings potential reduces the potential use of a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. This is stated in Corollary 3 and displayed in Fig. 3.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper studies budget processes, both {{theoretically}} and experimentally. We {{compare the}} outcomes of bottom-up and <b>top-down</b> <b>budget</b> processes. It is often presumed that a <b>top-down</b> <b>budget</b> process leads to a smaller overall budget than a bottom-up budget process. Ferejohn and Krehbiel (1987) showed theoretically that this need not be the case. We test experimentally the theoretical predictions of their work.

40|$|This paper studies budget processes, both {{theoretically}} and experimentally. We give {{a sufficient}} condition for <b>top-down</b> and bottom-up <b>budget</b> processes {{to have the}} same voting equilibrium. Furthermore, at a voting equilibrium, it is not always true, as often presumed, that a <b>top-down</b> <b>budget</b> process leads to a smaller overall budget than does a bottom-up budget process. To test the implications for budget processes of voting equilibrium theory, we conduct a series of 128 voting experiments using subjects in a behavior laboratory. The experimental evidence from these experiments is well organized by voting equilibrium theory, both at the aggregate level and at the individual subject level. In particular, subjects display considerable evidence of rationality in their proposals and votes. More complete information and fewer spending categories lead to greater predictive success of voting equilibrium theory, and reduce the time needed to reach a budget decision...|$|R
30|$|Christensen (1982), Penno (1984), and Kanodia (1993) {{highlight}} the optimality of participative budgets in some operating budgeting settings. In these papers, {{the use of}} a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process would be suboptimal. Magee (1980) and Kirby et al. (1991) study a setting in which a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process might be preferred to a participative budgeting process. In contrast to the present setting, these studies consider exogenous compensation schemes. They highlight that given these compensation schemes, the principal might prefer to have no participation by the agents. Penno (1990) illustrates that participation by the agents might not always be strictly preferred to no participation, i.e., a top-down approach. However, Penno (1990) does not find a strict preference for a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process {{as is the case in}} the present paper.|$|E

30|$|The model shows that, in {{the case}} of a low {{importance}} of coordination, the loss from imperfect coordination in a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process is outweighed by the additional costs for inducing truth-telling in a participative budgeting process. That is, the company prefers to implement a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process and to keep the managers uninformed. For a high importance of coordination, the use of a participative budgeting process is optimal. The results illustrate that the company might prefer to use a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process instead of a participative budgeting process. However, this is not true for the managers of the divisions. The managers receive higher positive expected rents with participation than they receive with top-down budgets. Thus, the managers always prefer to have a participative budgeting process in place.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies why public {{finances}} in Sweden have remained very strong {{during the current}} financial crisis. Unlike almost all other European countries, Sweden has had budget surpluses and a government debt ratio around 40 percent of GDP during the recent crisis. We attribute this to two important factors. First, Sweden entered the crisis with strong {{public finances}} and second that unemployment did not rise as much as normally during recessions. The Swedish fiscal framework that was introduced after the banking crisis in the early 1990 s with expenditure ceilings, a <b>top-down</b> <b>budget</b> process, balanced budget requirement for local governments has played an important role. We show that the behavior of budget deficits has changed significantly recently, from a deficit bias to a surplus bias. Aggregate demand remained strong during the crisis even though exports fell sharply. As unemployment in the manufacturing sector increased, it was {{to a large extent}} offset by increased employment in the service sector.

30|$|The {{model design}} {{is subject to}} a couple of limitations. First, the {{assumption}} is invoked that, in a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process, the managers do not obtain private information. For example, this information can stem from market research, target costing, or value engineering and the managers’ expertise is needed to interpret the provided information. Throughout this paper, the company decides not to implement the information system like market research, target costing, or value engineering when the <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process is implemented. This means, the company does not enable the managers to obtain the information needed for coordination. If the managers also obtained the private information in the <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process, the company would need to provide higher expected compensation to induce high effort supply. With private information, the managers know exactly how high effort affects the probability to obtain high earnings. Without private information, the managers know this only in expectation. Thus, more compensation is needed when the managers are informed. Due to the revelation principle, the <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process never becomes strictly optimal when the managers are informed. However, as the compensation costs with a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process are smaller when the managers do not obtain the private information, the company does not want the managers to be informed. Hence, the company does not want the managers to obtain private information in a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process and the information system is not installed. The advantage of this assumption is that it enables the model to establish a strict preference of the <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process for a low importance of coordination. This is in line with the empirical finding that both top-down and participative budgeting processes are implemented in practice (Shastri and Stout 2008). Next to this advantage, the assumption also bears a drawback. The budgeting process is connected to a specific information setup which is an exogenous restriction on the company’s design of the information system. However, as outlined above, when the company chooses the design of the budgeting process and the information setup, it either chooses the top-down or the participative budgeting process as studied in the present paper.|$|E
30|$|When a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> {{process is}} in place, the agents are not induced to provide truthful reports. Therefore, the agents only receive {{incentives}} for providing high productive effort. The resulting rent is positive, i.e., each agent’s expected utility exceeds his reservation utility of zero (Proposition 1). In {{the case of}} a participative budgeting process, the agents obtain additional rents, because the principal provides adapted compensation payments that induce the agents to truthfully report their private decision-relevant information. Consequently, if the agents designed the budgeting process in date 0, they would implement a participative budgeting process and obtain higher positive rents. This insight conforms with empirical findings. Practitioners would like to use more participation in the budgeting system (Libby and Lindsay 2010). Heinle et al. (2014) also illustrate that agents prefer a participative budgeting process to a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. The intuition is similar. With a participative budgeting process, the agent controls the reporting and the productive effort supply. In a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process, the agent only controls the productive effort supply and the principal controls the reporting. Thus, in Heinle et al. (2014), the agent receives less rents with top-down budgets than under a participative budgeting process. In the present paper, the agents also control the effort supply and the reporting when a participative budgeting process is implemented. However, for a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process, the control over reporting is completely set mute. This means, neither the agents nor the principal controls the reporting. The findings of Corollary  4 correspond to the results of Heinle et al. (2014), i.e., the agents obtain more rents with a participative budgeting process compared to a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process.|$|E
30|$|A {{raise in}} the {{earnings}} potential intensifies {{the effect of}} coordination on the expected earnings. Thus, the negative effect of an imperfect coordination by the managing owner increases. Imperfect coordination only occurs in a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. The incentive costs with both a top-down and a participative budgeting process are unaffected {{by an increase in}} the earning potential. In sum, the economic effect of coordination becomes stronger, whereas the incentive costs are unaffected. Therefore, an increase in the earnings potential makes the use of a participative budgeting process more attractive relative to the use of a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process.|$|E

30|$|The article {{proceeds}} as follows. In {{the next}} section, {{the model is}} described and two benchmarks are displayed. As first benchmark, the first best solution is considered in which the managing owner observes both the managers’ private information and their productive effort supplies. The second benchmark examines the setting when the managing owner learns the decision-relevant information, but does not observe the managers’ productive effort supplies. Subsequently, in Sects. 3 and 4, the findings regarding the <b>top-down</b> and participative <b>budgeting</b> process are presented. Afterwards, in Sect. 5, the findings for the top-down and the participative budgeting process are compared.

40|$|In {{addition}} to setting the performance {{agenda for the}} year ahead, (revenue) budgets in the healthcare sector can facilitate tighter financial control, more responsive decision-making and staff motivation. However, many healthcare managers may lose respect {{for the use of}} predominantly incremental budgets given that they typically do not explore historical service redundancies that may exist nor reward efficient use of resources or facilitate long-term service planning. The lengthy budgetary process can also predispose to out-ofdate <b>budgets.</b> <b>Top-down</b> budgetary allocation can also be susceptible to political influence and as supplementary estimates can be accessed, managers (and senior clinicians) may not exercise budgetary discipline. Rigid systems of budgeting can also stifle creativity and innovation.

30|$|Proposition 3 {{states the}} main {{result of this}} paper. The {{principal}} faces a trade-off between additional incentive costs and coordination benefits. For both the top-down and the participative budgeting process, the principal incurs incentive costs for inducing high productive effort supply. The additional incentive costs ensure that the agents report truthfully with participative budgets. With truthful reports about their private decision-relevant information, the principal can perfectly coordinate the agents’ operations. Imperfect coordination results in reduced expected earnings. Under a participative budgeting process, the principal incurs the additional incentive costs and benefits from perfect coordination. With top-down budgets, the principal {{does not need to}} provide additional incentives. Thus, she saves on the additional incentive costs. However, the principal suffers from reduced expected earnings because of imperfect coordination. In a situation of a low importance of coordination β, the principal prefers to use a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. Thus, a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process can be optimal for the principal. For a high importance of coordination, the principal uses a participative budgeting process. Then, a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process is never optimal for the principal. This finding is aligned with the empirical findings of Shields and Shields (1998). They illustrate that coordinating interdependence {{is one of the most}} important reasons for the participation of managers in the budgeting process. The model predicts that the principal prefers to use a participative compared to a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process for a high importance of coordinating the interdependent divisions.|$|E

40|$|The global methane (CH 4) {{budget is}} {{becoming}} an increasingly important component for managing realistic pathways to mitigate climate change. This relevance, due to a shorter atmospheric lifetime and a stronger warming potential than carbon dioxide, is challenged by the still unexplained changes of atmospheric CH 4 over the past decade. Emissions and concentrations of CH 4 are continuing to increase, making CH 4 {{the second most important}} human-induced greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Two major difficulties in reducing uncertainties come from the large variety of diffusive CH 4 sources that overlap geographically, and from the destruction of CH 4 by the very short-lived hydroxyl radical (OH). To address these difficulties, we have established a consortium of multi-disciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to synthesize and stimulate research on the methane cycle, and producing regular (??????biennial) updates of the global methane budget. This consortium includes atmospheric physicists and chemists, biogeochemists of surface and marine emissions, and socio-economists who study anthropogenic emissions. Following Kirschke et al. (2013), we propose here the first version of a living review paper that integrates results of top-down studies (exploiting atmospheric observations within an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up models, inventories and data-driven approaches (including process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry, and inventories for anthropogenic emissions, data-driven extrapolations). For the 2003 ??? 2012 decade, global methane emissions are estimated by top-down inversions at 558 ???Tg???CH 4 ???yr??? 1, range 540 ??? 568. About 60 ???% of global emissions are anthropogenic (range 50 ??? 65 ???%). Since 2010, the bottom-up global emission inventories have been closer to methane emissions in the most carbon-intensive Representative Concentrations Pathway (RCP 8. 5) and higher than all other RCP scenarios. Bottom-up approaches suggest larger global emissions (736 ???Tg???CH 4 ???yr??? 1, range 596 ??? 884) mostly because of larger natural emissions from individual sources such as inland waters, natural wetlands and geological sources. Considering the atmospheric constraints on the <b>top-down</b> <b>budget,</b> it is likely that some of the individual emissions reported by the bottom-up approaches are overestimated, leading to too large global emissions. Latitudinal data from top-down emissions indicate a predominance of tropical emissions (?????? 64 ???% of the global budget, <??? 30 ?????N) as compared to mid (?????? 32 ???%, 30 ??? 60 ?????N) and high northern latitudes (?????? 4 ???%, 60 ??? 90 ?????N). Top-down inversions consistently infer lower emissions in China (?????? 58 ???Tg???CH 4 ???yr??? 1, range 51 ??? 72, ??? 14 ???%) and higher emissions in Africa (86 ???Tg???CH 4 ???yr??? 1, range 73 ??? 108, + 19 ???%) than bottom-up values used as prior estimates. Overall, uncertainties for anthropogenic emissions appear smaller than those from natural sources, and the uncertainties on source categories appear larger for top-down inversions than for bottom-up inventories and models. The most important source of uncertainty on the methane budget is attributable to emissions from wetland and other inland waters. We show that the wetland extent could contribute 30 ??? 40 ???% on the estimated range for wetland emissions. Other priorities for improving the methane budget include the following: (i) the development of process-based models for inland-water emissions, (ii) the intensification of methane observations at local scale (flux measurements) to constrain bottom-up land surface models, and at regional scale (surface networks and satellites) to constrain top-down inversions, (iii) improvements in the estimation of atmospheric loss by OH, and (iv) improvements of the transport models integrated in top-down inversions.

40|$|Industrially {{produced}} N-fertilizer {{is essential}} to the production of cereals that supports current and projected human populations. We constructed a <b>top-down</b> global N <b>budget</b> for maize, rice, and wheat for a 50 -year period (1961 to 2010). Cereals harvested a total of 1551 Tg of N, of which 48 % was supplied through fertilizer-N and 4 % came from net soil depletion. An estimated 48 % (737 Tg) of crop N, equal to 29, 38, and 25 kg ha− 1 yr− 1 for maize, rice, and wheat, respectively, is contributed by sources other than fertilizer- or soil-N. Non-symbiotic N 2 fixation appears to be the major source of this N, which is 370 Tg or 24 % of total N in the crop, corresponding to 13, 22, and 13 kg ha− 1 yr− 1 for maize, rice, and wheat, respectively. Manure (217 Tg or 14 %) and atmospheric deposition (96 Tg or 6 %) are the other sources of N. Crop residues and seed contribute marginally. Our scaling-down approach to estimate the contribution of non-symbiotic N 2 fixation is robust because it focuses on global quantities of N in sources and sinks that are easier to estimate, in contrast to estimating N losses per se, because losses are highly soil-, climate-, and crop-specific...|$|R
30|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, the principal designs the budgeting process. The principal has two options for the design of the budgeting process. She can either implement a top-down (TB) or a participative (PB) budgeting process. With a participative budgeting process in place, the agents obtain private information and the principal asks the agents to report on their private information. She cannot observe whether the reports are truthful or not. The report of agent i on his private information is denoted by r_i and can either be η _L or η _H. When the principal implements a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process, the agents neither obtain private information nor are asked to send a report. This means, whereas, in the participative budgeting process, the principal implements an information system that privately informs the agents about their divisions’ market fit, no information system is installed in the <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. The information system can, for example, regard market research, target costing, or value engineering which is relevant for the divisions’ operations. Because specific expertise is needed for interpreting the provided information each agent can solely observe her division’s information. Installation costs of the information system are not explicitly modeled. 1 However, the implicit assumption is made that the principal does not install a costly information system in the <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process, because the information cannot be elicited and, thus, not used by the principal. The assumption that the agents do not obtain private information in a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process is critically reflected in Sect. 6.|$|E
30|$|The {{principal}} deliberates {{whether to}} incur additional incentive costs regarding truthful reporting and thus {{being able to}} perfectly coordinate the agents’ operations in a participative budgeting process, or to save on incentive costs and suffer from imperfect coordination in a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. If the importance of coordination is low, the additional incentive costs exceed the benefits from perfect coordination. Consequently, the principal prefers to implement a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. However, when the importance of coordination β is large, the benefits from improved coordination outweigh the additional incentive costs for inducing truthful reporting by the agents. Therefore, the principal implements a participative budgeting process. The findings are summarized in Proposition 3 and visualized in Fig. 2.|$|E

However, the level of delegation and the method of determining the expenditure ceilings vary across countries.

30|$|The {{findings}} of the present paper highlight {{that the use of}} a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process might be optimal, too.

30|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature in three ways. First, it complements the insights generated by the analytical literature on managers’ participation in the budgeting process. Given a budget-based bonus scheme, Magee (1980) establishes that a manager’s participation in the budgeting process is detrimental for the company, because the manager maximally misreports. Baiman and Evans III (1983) highlight that the company prefers the participative budgeting process only when the manager is induced to report the private decision-relevant information truthfully. Contrary to Magee (1980) and Baiman and Evans III (1983), the present paper illustrates that the <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process might be preferred by the company due to lower incentive costs, although the managers report truthfully in the participative budgeting process. Penno (1990) finds that the company solely prefers a manager’s participation in the budgeting process when the compensation contract can be based on the reported private information. Despite basing the compensation contract on the reported private information in the participative budgeting process, the present paper shows that the <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process is preferred for a low importance of coordinating the divisions’ interdependence. Kirby et al. (1991) study participation in a setting where the manager is induced to set unbiased hurdles by a compensation scheme belonging to a class of budget-based performance evaluation schemes. Participation can reduce the manager’s informational rents and, therefore, be preferred by the company. The present paper’s finding complements this result by highlighting that the <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process might be preferred because of lower informational rents. Heinle et al. (2014) illustrate that the company prefers a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process whenever the level of information asymmetry between the manager and her superior is small. The present paper adds to this finding by showing the impact of the importance of coordinating the divisions’ operations on the design of the budgeting process.|$|E
30|$|Under a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process, the {{principal}} induces the agents to provide high productive effort. The effort provision is not observable by {{the principal}}.

30|$|If {{installation}} {{costs of the}} information system exist, the net benefit of the participative budgeting process decreases.

30|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the design of}} the budgeting process when a company faces an interdependence among the divisions. In particular, two generic design possibilities are considered. The company can either implement a top-down or a participative budgeting process. The design of the budgeting process {{at the beginning of the}} period determines whether the managers will obtain and report private information or not. Under a <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process, the managers do not obtain private information, whereas this information is obtained and acknowledged in a participative budgeting process.|$|E
30|$|In {{line with}} the second benchmark, the {{principal}} needs to pay a bonus {{in the case of}} the high earnings to induce high effort provision. However, as neither the principal nor the agents observe the realization of the decision-relevant private information the bonus is determined with the information’s expected probability E[η _i], i.e., w_i^H,TB=c/E[η _i]. Thus, the principal incurs incentive costs because of the moral hazard problem. Imperfect coordination reduces the probability to obtain high earnings. However, this probability remains positive. Proposition 1 summarizes the findings for the <b>top-down</b> <b>budgeting</b> process.|$|E
