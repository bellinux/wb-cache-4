5|$|In 1944, Hilliard {{returned}} to entertainment acoustics with Altec Lansing. Improving on the Shearer Horn System, Hilliard worked with Jim Lansing and Blackie Blackburn {{to develop the}} loudspeaker system of the 20th century: the Voice of the Theatre (VOTT).

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences immediately began testing its sonic characteristics; they made it <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>theater</b> industry standard in 1955. Production of the long-lived VOTT continued into the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Prine, {{who played}} Norman Ramsey, wrote the last {{fifth of the}} film because it had no ending.

5|$|The Progress Party {{was founded}} {{at a meeting}} at <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>theater</b> Saga Kino in Oslo on 8 April 1973, {{attended}} by around 1,345 persons.

Since the end of the war, he had worked as an independent right-wing political editor and public speaker. Lange held his first public speech as chairman of ALP at Youngstorget in Oslo on 16 May the same year.

25|$|Leonard's primary health {{concern is}} his lactose intolerance: his {{consuming}} melon or any dairy products (and {{according to the}} pilot episode, even corn) results in flatulence. Leonard wears eyeglasses because of astigmatism, and cannot see without them.

In order to avoid detection by a sick Sheldon and Penny, who was nursing him, Howard and Raj helped him to navigate {{through the living room}} by using a helmet camera. Leonard states in one episode that he suffers from sleep apnea. During his relationship with Leslie Winkle, he tells her that many members of his family have died from heart disease and thus he has a genetic disposition to the condition.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the early}} 20th century, Golden {{maintained}} {{a small town}} population of around 2,500 people. Several industries faded or were destroyed by tragic events, , but others flourished to continue Golden's industrial legacy, including its brewing, brick making, clay mining and porcelain industries. Golden became even more connected through mass transit, with two trolley lines extending to Denver, while <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>theater</b> gradually took {{the place of the}} opera house for downtown entertainment. Downtown revitalization efforts began in the 1920s with its first streetscape and ornamental lighting project and urban renewal on its north and east, anchored by new senior high and grade schools. The historic cultural tension between the city's north and south sides gradually eased, and the town successfully endured additional major economic depressions, including the Silver Crash of 1893 and the Great Depression. The School of Mines gained a worldwide academic reputation, Coors rapidly came to the forefront of the national and international brewing and ceramics industries, and the city modernized with a recreation center, paved streets and more.|$|E

25|$|Fox Film {{songwriter}} Jay Gorney {{was walking}} out of the viewing of Temple's last Frolics of Youth picture when he saw her dancing in <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>theater</b> lobby. Recognizing her from the screen, he arranged for her to have a screen test for the movie Stand Up and Cheer! Temple arrived for the audition on December 7, 1933; she won the part and was signed to a $150-per-week contract that was guaranteed for two weeks by Fox Film Corporation. The role was a breakthrough performance for Temple. Her charm was evident to Fox executives, and she was ushered into corporate offices almost immediately after finishing Baby Take a Bow, a song and dance number she did with James Dunn. On December 21, 1933, her contract was extended to a year at the same $150/week with a seven-year option and her mother Gertrude was hired on at $25/week as her hairdresser and personal coach. Released in May 1934, Stand Up and Cheer! became Shirley's breakthrough film. Within months, she became the symbol of wholesome family entertainment. In June, her success continued when she was loaned out to Paramount for Little Miss Marker.|$|E
