5|$|Risk parity advocates {{assert that}} the unlevered risk parity {{portfolio}} is quite close to the tangency portfolio, as close as can be measured given uncertainties and noise in the data. Theoretical and empirical arguments are made {{in support of this}} contention. One specific set of assumptions that puts the risk parity portfolio on the efficient frontier is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical Sharpe ratios. Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity portfolio is near the tangency portfolio but <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E

As he hands his passport to the immigration officer, his hand is shown with no ring; thus he was conclusively in reality when seeing his children. Furthermore, the children were portrayed by different actors, indicating they had aged.|$|E

According to the prosecution, this is the telephone call {{known to have been}} made by Bamber, the same call that is entered in the event log. There was only one call that night to the police station about the shooting, the prosecution says, and it was made by Bamber at or just before 3:26am. Bamber's defence team argues otherwise. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> radio log is not a duplicate log of Bamber's call, but that it shows Nevill also telephoned the police that night.|$|E

25|$|Some unorthodox economists like Stephen Kanitz {{attribute}} {{the debt crisis}} not to the high Brazilian level of indebtedness nor to the disorganization of the country's economy. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cause of the crisis was rather a minor error in the U.S. government banking regulations which forbids its banks from lending over ten {{times the amount of}} their capital, a regulation that, when the inflation eroded their lending limits, forced them to cut the access of underdeveloped countries to international savings.|$|E

25|$|People have asked, so {{what are}} the demands? What are the demands all of these people are making? Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> demands for social {{equality}} and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible – that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then yes, we demand the impossible.|$|E
25|$|Supporters {{of hunting}} {{maintain}} that when foxes or other prey (such as coyotes {{in the western}} USA) are hunted, the quarry are either killed relatively quickly (instantly or {{in a matter of}} seconds) or escapes uninjured. Similarly, <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> animal rarely endures hours of torment and pursuit by hounds, and research by Oxford University shows that the fox is normally killed after an average of 17minutes of chase. They further argue that, while hunting with hounds may cause suffering, controlling fox numbers by other means is even more cruel. Depending on the skill of the shooter, the type of firearm used, the availability of good shooting positions and luck, shooting foxes can cause either an instant kill, or lengthy periods of agony for wounded animals which can die of the trauma within hours, or of secondary infection over a period of days or weeks. Research from wildlife hospitals, however, indicates that {{it is not uncommon for}} foxes with minor shot wounds to survive. Hunt supporters further say that it is a matter of humanity to kill foxes rather than allow them to suffer malnourishment and mange.|$|E
500|$|The Wachowskis {{describe}} several themes {{present in}} Bound. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film is about [...] "the boxes people make of their lives", {{that it is}} not only gay people who [...] "live in closets". They wanted to define all of Bounds characters by the [...] "sort of trap that they were making out of their lives". Violet is trapped in her life with Caesar, and in the first scene, Corky is literally inside Violet's closet, bound and gagged by Caesar. This scene is echoed later in the film when Violet says [...] "I had this image of you inside of me..." [...] This theme of being trapped is exacerbated by the claustrophobic feeling created by {{the fact that most of}} the film takes place in Corky's apartment, Violet and Casear's apartment, or the apartment next door where Corky is working.|$|E

500|$|According to Rhonda Wilcox and J. P. Williams in [...] "What Do You Think? The X-Files, Liminality, and Gender Pleasure", [...] "Humbug" [...] {{is about}} [...] "difference, sex, and looking". Regarding The X-Files as a whole, <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{relationship}} between Mulder and Scully is non-sexual and [...] "quasi-marital". Although sharing {{a degree of}} intimacy {{that allows them to}} share each other's space, they avoid a sexual or objectifying gaze: [...] "They look into each other's eyes and argue ideas, rather than gazing at each other's bodies." [...] This status quo is challenged in this episode as the objectifying gaze is highlighted and deconstructed, although not between the partners themselves. According to Wilcox and Williams, a key scene involves Agent Scully and Lanny. When Lanny goes to wake Scully in her trailer one morning, he catches a glimpse of her breasts; she inadvertently exposes herself as she in turn catches sight of Lanny's uncovered parasitic twin; [...] "each gaze involves the objectification of difference". This objectification is emphasized by the fact that Scully's body is not normally revealed in this way.|$|E

Animal rights theorists criticize these positions, arguing that the words [...] "unnecessary" [...] and [...] "humane" [...] are subject to widely differing interpretations, and that animals have basic rights. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only way to ensure protection for animals is to end their status as property and to ensure that they are never used as commodities.|$|E

Republicans claim that the violence was started by a mob of loyalists returning from an Orange march. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> loyalists tried to set the church alight and invade Short Strand, {{with the intention of}} burning the residents from their homes. Hence, republicans argue that they were defending the Short Strand from loyalist attack.

They argue that republicans attacked Protestants to lure them into [...] "a carefully prepared trap".|$|E
2500|$|Other creationists {{accept the}} {{existence}} of the geological column and believe that it indicates a sequence of events that might have occurred during the global flood. Institute for Creation Research creationists such as Andrew Snelling, Steven A. Austin and Kurt Wise take this approach, as does Creation Ministries International. They cite the Cambrian explosion — the appearance of abundant fossils in the upper Ediacaran (Vendian) Period and lower Cambrian Period [...] — as the pre-Flood/Flood boundary, the presence in such sediments of fossils that do not occur later in the geological record as part of a pre–flood biota that perished and the absence of fossilized organisms that appear later (such as angiosperms and mammals) as due to erosion of sediments deposited by the flood as waters receded off the land. Creationists say that fossilization can only take place when the organism is buried quickly to protect the remains from destruction by scavengers or decomposition. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fossil record provides evidence of a single cataclysmic flood and not of a series of slow changes accumulating over millions of years.|$|E
