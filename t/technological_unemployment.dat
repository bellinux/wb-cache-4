40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{theoretical and}} empirical scientific literature {{about the impact of}} <b>technological</b> innovations on <b>unemployment,</b> considering the former as a key driver of long-term productivity and economic growth. Using panel data from 25 European countries for the period of 2000 – 2012, we aim to examine whether <b>technological</b> innovations affect <b>unemployment.</b> We used triadic patent families per million inhabitants as our main proxy for technological innovations, as well as other unemployment controls, in our model, which were estimated using System Generalized Method of Moments (SGMM). Finding no significant relationship between <b>technological</b> innovations and <b>unemployment</b> in our base estimation, we re-estimated it testing the impact with a time lag as well as using alternative proxies for technological innovations. Overall, the research estimations do not suggest that technological innovations have an effect on unemployment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Kaleckian growth model that incorporates endogenous technological change. The model endogenously determines {{the rate of}} capacity utilization, the rate of economic growth, income distribution, and the employment rate in addition to technological change. The paper shows that whether or not {{an increase in the}} relative bargaining power of workers raises the long-run equilibrium unemployment rate depends on which regime is realized in the long-run equilibrium. If, for example, the long-run equilibrium corresponds to the wage-led growth regime, a rise in the relative bargaining power of workers leads to a decline in the unemployment rate. This result is never obtained from the mainstream NAIRU model. Kaleckian model Endogenous <b>technological</b> change <b>Unemployment</b> Inter-class conflict...|$|R
40|$|Bbook description: In recent years, <b>technological</b> change, <b>unemployment</b> and {{industrial}} restructuring have highlighted {{training and the}} acquisition of skills as a policy issue. There is widespread concern that employees are insufficiently skilled, and it is recognised that this deficiency can have serious economic consequences. The situation {{is likely to become}} particularly urgent, as the dramatic increase in the share of temporary and part-time employment in the OECD leads to a decline in the incentives to train. This book, from the Centre for Economic Policy Research, provides a systematic account of the causes, consequences, and policy implications of failure in training provision and skills acquisition in the industrial world. It explains why the market mechanism leads people to under-invest in skills and examines the empirical outcome of these problems using a portfolio of examples for European countries...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} technological advancements on employment and wages in European Union. In order to examine this relation the date set for period over 1990 - 2010 of 10 European Member states were used. The data represented statistical information for Austria, Germany, France, Finland, Spain, Denmark, Netherlands, Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom. With the help of regression it was concluded there is significant relation of employment and wages with technological advancements. I use the R&D expenditures share of GDP as main proxy for <b>technological</b> advancements, <b>unemployment</b> rate and average wage for dependent variable. Using the Fixed Effects estimator, I found that there is negative relation between R&D expenditures and Unemployment rate. Similarly, I found that there is negative relation between R&D expenditures and Average Wages. Thus, I discuss possible explanation for this paradox...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between disembodied <b>technological</b> progress and <b>unemployment</b> in a standard search-matching model. We find that {{the sign of the}} correlation crucially depends on the degree of idiosyncratic uncertainty. The analysis uncovers a new effect whereby an increase in growth intensifies the endogenous rate of job separation because it raises the workers' outside option. For plausible parameter values, the outside option effect outweighs the capitalization effect, so that disembodied technological progress increases the rate of unemployment.

50|$|Especially {{after the}} Glorious Revolution, {{authorities}} became less sympathetic to workers concerns about {{losing their jobs}} due to innovation. An increasingly influential strand of Mercantalist thought held that introducing labour saving technology would actually reduce unemployment, as it would allow British firms to increase their market share against foreign competition. From the early 18th century workers could no longer rely on support from the authorities against the perceived threat of <b>technological</b> <b>unemployment.</b> They would sometimes take direct action, such as machine breaking, in attempts {{to protect themselves from}} disruptive innovation. Schumpeter notes that as the 18th century progressed, thinkers would raise the alarm about <b>technological</b> <b>unemployment</b> with increasing frequency, with von Justi being a prominent example.

50|$|Limited {{macroeconomic}} {{analysis has}} been done to study the relationship between <b>technological</b> shocks and <b>unemployment.</b> The small amount of existing research, however, suggests mixed results.

On the other hand, the job creating effect of product innovation could only be observed in the United States, not Italy. Another study in 2013 finds a more transitory, rather than permanent, <b>unemployment</b> effect of <b>technological</b> change.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to discuss the links between <b>technological</b> development, <b>unemployment,</b> work sharing and some {{environmental}} issues. The discussion explores whether reduced working hours in general are likely to generate reduced pollution and other environmental benefits. Although several environmental problems are mentioned, the focus is mainly on greenhouse gas emissions. The conclusion is {{that there might be}} some environmental gains from reduced working hours in the short term, but this conclusion is not robust. In the discussion of the long-term consequences, the importance of technological development is emphasized. Especially in connection with global warming, for example the technological development within new renewable energy production is of special interest. In the literature on endogenous growth the role of the working force and "learning by doing" are emphasized. A simple model with endogenous technological development is used to illustrate that there is a risk that reduced working hours could make reductions of greenhouse gas emissions more difficult...|$|R

50|$|Much <b>technological</b> <b>unemployment,</b> {{due to the}} {{replacement}} of workers by machines, might be counted as structural unemployment. Alternatively, <b>technological</b> <b>unemployment</b> might refer {{to the way in}} which steady increases in labour productivity mean that fewer workers are needed to produce the same level of output every year. The fact that aggregate demand can be raised to deal with this problem suggests that this problem is instead one of cyclical unemployment. As indicated by Okun's Law, the demand side must grow sufficiently quickly to absorb not only the growing labour force but also the workers made redundant by increased labour productivity.|$|E
50|$|Programmes of Public {{works have}} {{traditionally}} been used as way for governments to directly boost employment, though this has often been opposed by some, but not all, conservatives.

We find that, depending on the elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled workers and the elasticity of the matching function, an increase in the skill ratio can reduce the relative unemployment rate of skilled workers and decrease the relative emigration rate of skilled workers (brain drain). We provide empirical estimates and simulations to support our findings and show that effects are empirically relevant and potentially sizeable...|$|R
40|$|We analyze how unemployment, job {{finding and}} job {{separation}} rates react to neutral and investment-specific technology shocks. Neutral shocks increase unemployment and explain {{a substantial portion}} of it volatility; investment-specific shocks expand employment and hours worked and contribute to hours worked volatility. Movements in the job separation rates are responsible for the impact response of unemployment while job finding rates for movements along its adjustment path. The evidence warns against using models with exogenous separation rates and challenges the conventional way of modelling technology shocks in search and sticky price models. <b>Unemployment,</b> <b>technological</b> progress, labor market flows, business cycle models. ...|$|R

5000|$|According to author Gregory Woirol, the {{phenomenon}} of <b>technological</b> <b>unemployment</b> {{is likely to have}} existed since at least the invention of the wheel. [...] Ancient societies had various methods for relieving the poverty of those unable to support themselves with their own labour. Ancient China and ancient Egypt may have had various centrally run relief programmes in response to <b>technological</b> <b>unemployment</b> dating back to at least the second millennium BC. Ancient Hebrews and adherents of the ancient Vedic religion had decentralised responses where aiding the poor was encouraged by their faiths. [...] In ancient Greece, large numbers of free labourers could find themselves unemployed due to both the effects of ancient labour saving technology and to competition from slaves ("machines of flesh and blood"). Sometimes, these unemployed workers would starve to death or were forced into slavery themselves although in other cases they were supported by handouts. Pericles responded to perceived <b>technological</b> <b>unemployment</b> by launching public works programmes to provide paid work to the jobless.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the implications of}} that workers {{may not be able}} to estimate their true costs of acquiring skills. Consequently, too few workers may acquire skills. This allows for the possibility that subsidizing education is welfare improving. Furthermore, if the presence of skill-biased <b>technological</b> shocks increase <b>unemployment,</b> this may explain why the market it-self cannot respond to this by making it sufficiently attractive to acquire skills. Consequently, the trade-off in-between subsidizing education and thereby reducing unemployment and optimizing welfare may be eliminated. We analyse this issue in a simple educational model and next in a search equilibrium model including a skill choice decision. Education; subsidies; efficiency; unemployment...|$|R
