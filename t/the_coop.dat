40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{evaluate}} unrealized economies of vertical integration for rural electric cooperatives. Given the well-established network economies that {{are inherent in}} the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity, <b>the</b> <b>coops</b> long-standing choice of market structure is questionable (especially if their strategy is welfare maximization). Organized as either generation-and-transmission or distribution-only, the traditional measures of vertical economies will not work. Thus, I have devised an alternative method by which to measure such economies and find that, on average, cost savings in excess of 39 % could have been realized had <b>the</b> <b>coops</b> adopted a vertically integrated structure. ...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Coop</b> {{collects}} {{a variety}} of hard-to-recycle plastic packaging for upcycling. This recycling initiative started with the collecting of yogurt cups to be upcycled into toothbrushes and other personal care goods by Recycline in 2008, {{at a time when}} New York City's municipal recycling limited the types of plastic accepted. With changes in NYC's trash recycling policies, the Park Slope Food Coop put together the hard-to-recycle plastics collection currently in place with Terracycle for single serve baby food pouches, plastic cling wrap, produce bags, toothbrushes, toothpaste tubes, and water filters.|$|E

50|$|The {{impact of}} Wechsberg's gender-focused {{work has been}} {{recognized}} both nationally and internationally.

Recently, Wechsberg began developing a mobile app that would make <b>the</b> Young Women's <b>CoOp</b> more accessible to adolescent and young adult women at-risk for HIV.

The pool collapsed financially in 1931 and the federal government had to cover the losses; <b>the</b> <b>coop</b> continued as a network of elevators owned by the farmers. It advanced the reform agenda for agricultural development, with full-time district representatives, or fieldmen, who promoted education, demonstrations of farm equipment, community picnics and rallies, and cooperative insurance, among other programs.|$|E
2500|$|While often {{confused}} with free-range farming, yarding {{is actually a}} separate method of poultry culture by which chickens and cows are raised together. The distinction is that free-range poultry are either totally unfenced, or the fence is so distant that it has little influence on their freedom of movement. Yarding is common technique used by small farms in the Northeastern US. [...] The birds are released daily from hutches or coops. [...] The hens usually lay eggs either {{on the floor of}} <b>the</b> <b>coop</b> or in baskets if provided by the farmer. This husbandry technique can be complicated if used with roosters, mostly because of aggressive behavior.|$|E
