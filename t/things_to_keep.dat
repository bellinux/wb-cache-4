25|$|Symptoms from {{complete}} isolation, called sensory deprivation, often include anxiety, sensory illusions, or even distortions {{of time and}} perception. However, {{this is the case}} when there is no stimulation of the sensory systems at all, and not only lack of contact with people. Thus, by having other <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> one's mind busy, this is avoided.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead's {{managers}} {{defended the}} release as [...] "a solution for Radiohead, not the industry", and doubted [...] "it would work {{the same way}} [...] ever again." [...] Radiohead did not repeat the pay-what-you-want model for subsequent releases. In February 2013, Yorke told the Guardian that though Radiohead had hoped to subvert the corporate music industry with In Rainbows, he feared they had instead played {{into the hands of}} content providers such as Apple and Google: [...] "They have to keep commodifying <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the share price up, but in doing so they have made all content, including music and newspapers, worthless, in order to make their billions. And this is what we want?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The hardest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{in mind is}} that it is a {{high school}} show. The quality is {{consistently}} far beyond what might be expected, better, in fact, than any university musical.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Bob Bradley, the American {{coach of}} Egypt {{national}} football team said in March 2013 about Aboutrika: [...] "Everywhere we went people would say, 'You must pick Aboutrika'. He's incredibly popular {{and the people}} love him. He's respected {{not just as a}} player but as a man. He did all of the right <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> himself at a high level. He is without a doubt a leader for us, and he brings experience and intelligence in a way that can make a very big difference".|$|E
2500|$|Shōshi {{appears to}} have been a serious and studious young woman who {{expected}} decorum from her ladies-in-waiting– often difficult at a fractious court. When she asked Murasaki for lessons in Chinese, she insisted they be conducted in secret. Murasaki explained that [...] "because [...] evinced a desire to know more about such <b>things,</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it secret we carefully chose times when the other women would not be present, and, from the summer before last I started given her informal lessons on the two volumes of 'New Ballads'. I hid this fact from others, as did Her Majesty".|$|E
2500|$|Evidence that is {{consistent}} with conventional theories of why democracy emerges and is sustained has been hard to come by. Recent statistical analyses have challenged modernisation theory by demonstrating that there is no reliable evidence for the claim that democracy is more likely to emerge when countries become wealthier, more educated, or less unequal. Neither is there convincing evidence that increased reliance on oil revenues prevents democratisation, despite a vast theoretical literature on [...] "the Resource Curse" [...] that asserts that oil revenues sever the link between citizen taxation and government accountability, seen as the key to representative democracy. The lack of evidence for these conventional theories of democratisation have led researchers to search for the [...] "deep" [...] determinants of contemporary political institutions, be they geographical or demographic. More inclusive institutions lead to democracy because as people gain more power, they are able to demand more from the elites, who in turn have to concede more <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their position. This virtuous circle, may end up in democracy.|$|E
6000|$|Lord Theign {{looked for}} a moment as if these were rather large presumptions; then he put them in their place a little curtly. [...] "It's one <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> our {{possessions}} for ourselves--it's another <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them for other people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{love to do}} it. Only you mustn't pay too much," [...] said Letty, glad of any <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{her hands}} and {{thoughts}} busy, for life was very bare and cold just then.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't doubt {{but what}} a lot of the Germans are loyal to this country," [...] came from Spouter. [...] "Just the same, it's a good <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> your eyes on them." ...|$|R

And this is what we want?" [...] Later that year, Yorke and Godrich made headlines for their criticism of the music streaming service Spotify. In July, they removed Atoms for Peace and Yorke's solo music from the service. In a series of tweets, Yorke wrote: [...] "Make no mistake, new artists you discover on Spotify will not get paid. Meanwhile shareholders will shortly be rolling in it... New artists get paid fuck-all with this model." [...] Yorke called Spotify [...] "the last gasp of the old industry", accusing it of only benefiting major labels with large back catalogues, and encouraged artists to build their own [...] "direct connections" [...] with audiences instead.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, the {{developers}} {{had intended to}} do a straight adaptation of the film. However, they quickly concluded that doing so presented two inherent problems; the original screenplay was so good, they felt it couldn't be replicated in a gaming environment, and because Montana dies at the end, they felt players {{would not want to}} invest in developing a character that they knew was doomed from the beginning. As such, they decided the game would tell an original story, set after the film. Jason Bone, combat designer on the game, explained [...] "We didn't want to rehash the movie because we feel that to make a good game, {{there needs to be a}} compelling storyline with good characters that drive you through it. There have been a lot of games that have been made based on movies, and when they follow the exact storyline of the movie, you lose a little bit of interest if you know where things are going. We felt that a fresh start would allow us to have the freedom to do new and interesting <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the player motivated and engaged." ...|$|E

60|$|The illustrious Masseuse, having much {{to conceal}} from her {{faithful}} Selina, {{was well aware}} that she had only one <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> hidden from me; namely, the advantage which she would have gained if her inquiries had met with success.|$|R
6000|$|But, at all events, it {{is surely}} the pastor's duty to prevent his flock from mis-understanding it; and above all <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them from supposing that God's {{forgiveness}} is to be had simply for the asking, by those who [...] "wilfully sin after they have received {{the knowledge of the}} truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|DORA. Well, dearie, {{men have}} to do some awfully mean <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up their respectability. But you cant blame them for that, can you?

6000|$|... "I {{advise you}} to keep your book-shelves in nice order at college," [...] he continued; [...] "and so with your {{apparatus}} and your cabinet. For at college, you see, you will perhaps have articles of philosophical apparatus, and a cabinet of specimens, instead of playthings. I advise you, if you should have such <b>things,</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them all nicely arranged upon their shelves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is," [...] replied Danny, [...] "but, as I said before, it is a {{very good}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> one on guard when there are as many {{watching}} for one as there are for me. Now there's Mr. Blacksnake and--" ...|$|R

60|$|Rust, to prevent.--Paraffine and mercurial {{ointment}} {{are perhaps}} the two best <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> rust off iron, in sea voyages or in boat-shooting. Before embarking for a voyage, it is convenient to enclose the guns in a leaden case, which, on arrival, can be melted up into bullets. It is remarkable how much better dirty guns withstand rust than clean ones.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{expected}} to take you, Mr. Tippengray," [...] said his hostess, [...] "but Lanigan Beam said he had seen you and Miss Rose walking across the fields to Lethbury, and so they asked him to go. I hope they'll be back to dinner, but there's no knowing, and so I put in a basket of sandwiches and <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them from starving before they get home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very bad indeed; {{but there}} are {{enormous}} woods, {{and the country is}} very wild, and everything is at sixes and sevens. However, of course you would not come, because it {{is in the middle of}} your London season. There would be ever so many <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> you. You are a man who, I suppose, never was out of London in June in your life, unless some race meeting was going on." ...|$|E

25|$|There {{is a large}} {{difference}} between {{the numbers of people}} whose native language is Russian and people who adopted Russian as their everyday communication language. Another <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> in mind is that the percentage of Russian-speaking citizens is significantly higher in cities than in rural areas across the whole country.|$|R
5000|$|As Yiguandao written {{material}} explains: The important <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{in mind is}} {{that these}} deities ... serve as reminders for us <b>to</b> always <b>keep</b> their teachings in mind, and we honour them for the virtues they embody, such as tolerance, open mind, cheerfulness and generosity (Maitreya); justice, fairness, honour, courage and loyalty (Guangong); compassion, giving, caring and nurturing (Guanyin).|$|R
6000|$|... "You may be sure I did {{not make}} for a port, where I should be questioned, but ran ashore in a wooded bay {{that looked as if}} no one had ever set foot there before. I dragged the boat up beyond, as I thought, the reach of the sea, and started to hunt for food and water. I found enough berries and <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> me alive, but not enough to stock my boat for another cruise. A week after I landed there was a tornado, and when it cleared off and I had {{recovered}} from my fright -- for the trees were blown down like rushes, and I thought my last day was come -- I found that the boat was washed away.|$|E
60|$|So White Fang {{knew nothing}} of the heaven a man's hand might contain for him. Besides, {{he did not like}} the hands of the man-animals. He was {{suspicious}} of them. It was true that they sometimes gave meat, but more often they gave hurt. Hands were <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> away from. They hurled stones, wielded sticks and clubs and whips, administered slaps and clouts, and, when they touched him, were cunning to hurt with pinch and twist and wrench. In strange villages he had encountered the hands of the children and learned that they were cruel to hurt. Also, he had once nearly had an eye poked out by a toddling papoose. From these experiences he became suspicious of all children. He could not tolerate them. When they came near with their ominous hands, he got up.|$|E
60|$|So of that restful state Lady Martin says: 'Indeed {{it was a}} most happy time to us, and I {{think on}} the whole to him. It was a new state of <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him without any pricks of {{conscience}} or restlessness on his part. He liked to have a quiet half-hour by the fire at night; and before I left him I used to put his books near him: his Bible, his Hebrew Psalter, his father's copy of Bishop Andrewes. Sometimes I would linger {{for a few minutes}} to talk about his past illness. He used to dwell specially on his dear father's nearness to him at that time. He spoke once or twice with a reverent holy awe and joy of sleepless nights, when thoughts of God had filled his soul and sustained him.|$|E

40|$|In {{countries}} where policies protecting private investor rights {{are more susceptible}} to change, substantial minority state ownership in a project can substantially decrease overall investment project risk.
