5|$|Due to {{the damage}} from the {{hurricane}} in the United States, the Salvation Army disaster units were sent throughout <b>the</b> <b>devastated</b> area. To prevent looting, residents in Breckenridge organized watches; the National Guard soon patrolled the streets. In Abilene, the United States Red Cross worked to feed the homeless and supply them with drinking water until city water services was restored.|$|E
5|$|Due to the flooding, twenty {{counties}} were declared federal disaster areas, {{clearing the}} way for assistance such as federal loans. Then-president Bill Clinton promised aid to the victims of the storm and then-governor George W.

5|$|In Hamden, Connecticut, the National Guard {{was called}} in to aid in cleanup and keep order, as some looting was {{reported}} in <b>the</b> <b>devastated</b> area. President George H. W.

40|$|AbstractCurrently, <b>the</b> {{prevention}} of <b>devastating</b> accidents (at least 3 fatalities in one accident) {{is still the}} focus of accidents prevention in China due to the serious consequence and the huge impact. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> {{prevention of}} <b>devastating</b> accidents that include at least 10 fatalities in one accident {{has been one of}} the most important tasks of road traffic safety. The study on <b>the</b> <b>devastating</b> accidents in China is relatively missing. The total situation, recent trends of <b>the</b> <b>devastating</b> accidents and characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>devastating</b> accidents are analyzed. Although <b>the</b> total <b>devastating</b> accidents were declined, serious accidents occurred more frequently and the consequences were more serious. The reasons of serious accidents are investigated. The increase of the accident risk and severity are main impact factors. Accidents with at least 10 fatalities in one accident occur sporadically, and it is unrealistic to completely avoid this kind of accidents. The ideas should been changed. Curbing all <b>devastating</b> accidents including <b>the</b> accidents with at least 10 fatalities in one accident should been the most important goal of road traffic safety at present. The macroscopic analysis and the in-depth analysis of devastating accident cases should be strengthened to further curb <b>the</b> <b>devastating</b> accidents...|$|R

5|$|Following Irma, many {{survivors}} in Benagaspasan demanded {{for an emergency}} airlift of food, medicine, and clothing. These {{were expected to be}} provided by air force authorities. Provençal governments asked the president to declare Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur provinces disaster areas. Marcos also toured over <b>the</b> <b>devastated</b> area, noting that damage was less than initially feared. On December1, President Marcos {{declared a state of emergency}} in 17Philippines provinces. Following a meeting, Marcos ordered the release of $278,750 to help subsidize rice to farmers. Moreover, $250,000 was ordered to be released for other relief operations.|$|E

Infrastructure damage totaled $106.2million (1988 USD), while damage to agriculture accumulated to $16.5million and damage totaled $8.9million in private properties. Overall, Skip {{was responsible for}} $131.8million in damage. Additionally, 144,136people or 28,824families were evacuated to shelters {{as a result of}} the flooding. In all, 237people were killed due to Typhoon Skip. Since many roads in <b>the</b> <b>devastated</b> area were impassable, officials were forced to ferry relief goods to stranded residents by small boats and military helicopters. The Canadian Red Cross donated CD$5,000, while the city of Ottawa donated CD$150,000.|$|E
5|$|Morris died in 1896, and {{the health}} of <b>the</b> <b>devastated</b> Burne-Jones {{declined}} substantially. In 1898 he suffered an attack of influenza, and had apparently recovered when he was again taken suddenly ill, and died on 17June 1898. Six days later, at the intervention of the Prince of Wales, a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey. It was the first time an artist had been so honoured.

When they reach the Red Line, however, Pavel is revealed to be a high-ranking officer; he detains Artyom {{to learn more about}} the Rangers and the Dark One. Artyom escapes and races Pavel's forces to locate the Dark One and Anna, who has been kidnapped by Lesnitsky, an ex-Ranger and Red Line spy. En route, he finds a contingent of Red Line forces massacring the inhabitants of a station, supposedly to contain a mysterious epidemic. It was the Red Line that introduced the virus to the station – weaponized Ebola acquired from the D6 vault by Lesnitsky. Artyom finds Anna and frees her but they are exposed to the virus and are quarantined after rescue. Afraid that she will die, Anna seduces Artyom.|$|E
5|$|Days {{after the}} storm, fears of food {{shortages}} began to arise as railways, in which food {{would normally be}} able to be delivered, were washed out. To deal with the large number of bodies {{in the wake of the}} disaster, Mexican officials decided to cremate and mass bury victims. By mid-September, between 1,600 and 1,800 people were hired to repair and rebuild <b>the</b> <b>devastated</b> railways in Nuevo León. In 2009, the third edition of the book El Río Fiera Bramaba: 1909 by Oswaldo Sánchez, re-accounting reports form people who experienced the flood, was planned. According to the director of publications at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, the book was considered one of historical quality. In memory of those who perished during the flood, the book was released to the public on August27, 2009, the 100year anniversary of the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Rescue trains were {{dispatched}} {{from across}} Atlantic Canada, {{as well as}} the northeastern United States. The first left Truro around 10am carrying medical personnel and supplies, arrived in Halifax by noon and returned to Truro with the wounded and homeless by 3pm. The track had become impassable at Rockingham, on the western edge of Bedford Basin. To reach the wounded, rescue personnel had to walk through parts of <b>the</b> <b>devastated</b> city until they reached a point where the military had begun to clear the streets. By nightfall, a dozen trains had reached Halifax from the Nova Scotian towns of Truro, Kentville, Amherst and Stellarton and from the New Brunswick towns of Sackville, Moncton and Saint John.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{hurricane}} made landfall, Mexico's natural disaster fund provided $1.45 million in aid to repair pipelines, highways, and buildings. The United Methodist Committee on Relief distributed food baskets to 720 survivors and provided 180 families with wood for rebuilding their homes. In addition, the Civil Protection Agency in Baja California, the Baja bush Pilots, and the Mexican Red Cross asked for donations of such as utensils, flashlights, lanterns, batteries, clothing, and light bedding. Following the hurricane, a riot in Santa Rosalía broke out {{due to lack of}} water. There was also a lack for shelter, as such this left many people sleeping in their cars. Within a week, the Mexican government assessed the damage form the hurricane, with 15 of them begin sent to Santa Rosalía and shortly thereafter, the Mexican Red Cross sent out relief efforts to <b>the</b> <b>devastated</b> area, especially in Santa Rosalía3.

5|$|Quatermass is {{rescued by}} a group of elderly people living in a scrap yard. At the hospital, the doctors are shocked when Isabel levitates off her bed and explodes in a cloud of dust. Elsewhere, <b>the</b> <b>devastated</b> Kapp is left alone in the ruins of his cottage and observatory. More and more young people are joining the Planet People, {{including}} the gangs that have been terrorising the cities and the soldiers assigned to keep them away from the Megalithic sites. Contact is restored with Chuck Marshall and with the Russians in the form of Gurov (Brewster Mason). Quatermass theorises {{that this is not the}} first time this has happened; megalithic sites such as prehistoric stone circles are in fact markers where beacons have been left by the alien force for its next visit. Quatermass believes the force is a sphere of energy surrounding the Earth. The Russians and the Americans send a space shuttle, commanded by Marshall, to make contact with the force. Quatermass is sceptical; he believes they are dealing not with an intelligence but with a machine constructed to harvest human protein. The space shuttle is destroyed but not before Marshall reports a giant beam of light stretching in all directions. Meanwhile, the Planet People are gathering at Wembley Stadium in the tens of thousands. Annie and Quatermass travel to the stadium but are powerless to prevent the Planet People from gathering. When they are attacked, Annie drives their car into the underground car park beneath the stadium where she crashes the vehicle and is killed. The lightning strikes the stadium.|$|E
