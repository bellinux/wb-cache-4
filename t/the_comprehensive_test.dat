40|$|AbstractHydropower {{projects}} are rapidly developing in China at present, {{and a number}} of high dams and large reservoirs are currently under construction or will soon be built. These large {{projects are}} mainly located on the great rivers in West China with complicated topographical and geological conditions. Evaluation of stability and safety of these high dam projects is an important topic. Geomechanical model test {{is one of the main}} methods to study the global stability of high dam and foundation. In this paper, a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>testing</b> method that combines overloading and strength reduction in a model is proposed. In this method, both the influence of excessive flooding and the effects of strength reduction of rock masses and weak structural planes on dam stability are considered. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>testing</b> method can accurately incorporate multiple factors that affect the global stability of high dam and its foundation. Based on the failure testing principle and model similarity theory, a similarity relation formula for safety evaluation through <b>comprehensive</b> <b>test</b> is established. A new model material, temperature-dependent analogous material, is also developed. By rising the temperature and reducing the strength of the model material, the mechanical behaviors resulting from gradual strength reduction can be simulated. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>testing</b> method is realized in a single model. For case studies, <b>the</b> <b>comprehensive</b> geomechanical model <b>test</b> is conducted for Jinping I and Xiaowan high arch dam projects...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{hazardous}} and radioactive materials packaging is to enable these materials {{to be transported}} without posing {{a threat to the}} health or property of the general public. To achieve this aim, regulations in the US have been written establishing general design requirements for such packagings. While no regulations have been written specifically for mixed waste packaging, regulations for the constituents of mixed wastes, i. e., hazardous and radioactive substances, have been codified by the US Department of Transportation (US DOT, 49 CFR 173) and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC, 10 CFR 71). Based on these national requirements, a Chemical Compatibility Testing Program was developed in the Transportation Systems Department at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL). The program provides a basis to assure any regulatory body that the issue of packaging material compatibility towards hazardous and radioactive materials has been addressed. In this paper, the authors present the results of the second phase of this testing program. The first phase screened five liner materials and six seal materials towards four simulant mixed wastes. This phase involved <b>the</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>testing</b> of five candidate liner materials to an aqueous Hanford Tank simulant mixed waste. <b>The</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>testing</b> protocol involved exposing the respective materials a matrix of four gamma radiation doses ({approximately} 1, 3, 6, and 40 kGy), three temperatures (18, 50, and 60 C), and four exposure times (7, 14, 28, and 180 days). Following their exposure to these combinations of conditions, the materials were evaluated by measuring five material properties.
