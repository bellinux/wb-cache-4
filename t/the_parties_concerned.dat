25|$|The {{fundamental}} goal {{of civil}} trials is to solve disputes over private rights {{so as to}} protect these rights. Civil litigation {{is based on the}} adversary system. A presiding judge directs the proceedings and exercises the right of elucidation to allow <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>concerned</b> to make proper and sufficient debates. Furthermore, the judge examines evidence in detail and makes fair decisions. Meanwhile, the court shall try, by all possible means, to expand the function of compromises and reconciliation to reduce the sources of litigation.|$|E

25|$|In {{parody of}} the college’s Oxbridge traditions, the first year {{students}} will occasionally disrupt the formality of the meal by hurling buns at their fellow undergraduates.

This is generally done with much struggle, however with little injury to any of <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>concerned.</b> As the artillery is traditionally limited to simple bread rolls, no significant damage results from these incidents.|$|E
25|$|A {{space is}} also left to Customary and {{traditional}} law: {{it can be}} applied in locales where it is recognized {{and to the extent}} it does not interfere with public order or constitutional guarantees of equality for all citizens. Also traditional rules dictating matrimonial regimes and inheritances may be applied only with the consent of <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>concerned,</b> or else by default the national law is used.

500|$|Assault in 18th-century England {{was viewed}} by the {{authorities}} not as a breach of the peace, {{but rather as a}} civil action between two parties in dispute. [...] The onus therefore was on Canning to take legal action against those she claimed had imprisoned her, and she would also be responsible for investigating the crime. [...] This was an expensive proposition and she would therefore require the help of her friends and neighbours to pursue her case. [...] An additional complication was that rather than send such matters to trial, justices preferred to reconcile <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>concerned.</b> [...] Therefore, although it was the state in which she returned to them on 29January which most offended Canning's friends, it was the theft of her stays—valued then at about 10shillings—that was the most promising aspect of the case. [...] The theft could be tried under a capital statute, making the assault charge less worthy of legal attention.|$|E
