60|$|To <b>this</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>on</b> {{the shores}} of the Firth of Forth, it is the popular persuasion, that the Rev. Mr. Shirrer's (of Kirkaldy) {{powerful}} intercession was the direct cause of the elemental repulse experienced off the endangered harbor of Leith.|$|E

30|$|We limited a trajectory, i.e., {{places a}} user visited {{sequentially}} {{in a given}} interval of time, {{to the length of}} a day, a significant time period in a user’s life. Thus, to form a trajectory, we created a vector with 24 slots, each representing one hour (Fig.  1). Each slot was assigned a number that represented the semantic meaning (Table  1) of the most frequent POI at <b>this</b> specific <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> specific day. Thus, the daily trajectory was defined as a string of 24 letters (POIs). If there was no record at a specific <b>hour,</b> <b>this</b> <b>hour</b> was assigned the semantic value of No Record.|$|R

60|$|The milking of {{the cows}} was a sight Mrs. Poyser loved, and at <b>this</b> <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> mild days she was usually {{standing}} at the house door, with her knitting in her hands, in quiet contemplation, only heightened to a keener interest when the vicious yellow cow, who had once kicked over a pailful of precious milk, was about to undergo the preventive punishment of having her hinder-legs strapped.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Princess {{brings it}} to my mind {{that this is a}} great matter, one not to be dealt with hastily. It may happen that when the Prince has taken counsel with her, and with his own heart, and perchance has sought the wisdom of the gods, he will change the words which have passed his lips.

I {{do not know}} that I should care for {{everybody}} to hear that I received visitors,--or worse still, a visitor,--at <b>this</b> <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> this day. But then it is so pleasant to feel oneself to be naughty! There is a Bohemian flavour of picnic about it which, though it does not come up to the rich gusto of real wickedness, makes one fancy that one is on the border of that delightful region in which there is none of the constraint of custom,--where men and women say what they like, and do what they like." ...|$|E
60|$|Something being {{expected}} of him, {{he had not}} been at home many days before a great curiosity as to why he stayed on so long began to arise in the heath. The natural term of a holiday had passed, yet he still remained. On the Sunday morning following the week of Thomasin's marriage a discussion on this subject was in progress at a hair-cutting before Fairway's house. Here the local barbering was always done at <b>this</b> <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> this day, to be followed by the great Sunday wash of the inhabitants at noon, which in its turn was followed by the great Sunday dressing an hour later. On Egdon Heath Sunday proper did not begin till dinner-time, and even then it was a somewhat battered specimen of the day.|$|E

60|$|Some {{five miles}} southward of Sligo is a gloomy and tree-bordered pond, a great gathering-place of water-fowl, called, {{because of its}} form, the Heart Lake. It is haunted by {{stranger}} things than heron, snipe, or wild duck. Out of this lake, as from the white square stone in Ben Bulben, issues an unearthly troop. Once men began to drain it; suddenly one of them raised a cry that he saw his house in flames. They turned round, and every man there saw his own cottage burning. They hurried home to find it was but faery glamour. To <b>this</b> <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> {{the border of the}} lake is shown a half-dug trench--the signet of their impiety. A little way from this lake I heard a beautiful and mournful history of faery kidnapping. I heard it from a little old woman in a white cap, who sings to herself in Gaelic, and moves {{from one foot to the}} other as though she remembered the dancing of her youth.|$|E
6000|$|... 'To-day!' {{cried the}} Doctor. 'Hear him! Ha, ha, ha! Of all {{days in the}} foolish year. Why, on this day, the great battle was fought on this ground. On this ground where we now sit, where I saw my two girls dance this morning, where the fruit has just been {{gathered}} for our eating from these trees, the roots of which are struck in Men, not earth, - so many lives were lost, that within my recollection, generations afterwards, a churchyard full of bones, and dust of bones, and chips of cloven skulls, has been dug up from underneath our feet here. Yet not a hundred people in that battle knew for what they fought, or why; not a hundred of the inconsiderate rejoicers in the victory, why they rejoiced. Not half a hundred people were the better for the gain or loss. Not half-a-dozen men agree to <b>this</b> <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> the cause or merits; and nobody, in short, ever knew anything distinct about it, but the mourners of the slain. Serious, too!' said the Doctor, laughing. [...] 'Such a system!' ...|$|E
60|$|I had seated {{myself on}} a half-sunken tombstone, and was musing, as one {{is apt to}} do at <b>this</b> sober-thoughted <b>hour,</b> <b>on</b> past scenes and early friends--on those who were distant {{and those who were}} dead--and indulging in that kind of melancholy fancying which has in it {{something}} sweeter even than pleasure. Every now and then the stroke of a bell from the neighboring tower fell on my ear; its tones were in unison with the scene, and, instead of jarring, chimed in with my feelings; and it was some time before I recollected that it must be tolling the knell of some new tenant of the tomb.|$|R

50|$|In 1893, the GER {{built the}} twin-screw Chelmsford {{to open a}} new night service.

6000|$|... "Come {{and be a}} fairy then," [...] she answered, very graciously. [...] "We {{are always}} on the wing about <b>this</b> <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> Wednesday night." [...] The words {{contained}} a general invitation for the season, and were esteemed by Lopez {{as an indication of}} great favour. It must be acknowledged of the Duchess that she was prone to make favourites, perhaps without adequate cause; though it must be conceded to her that she rarely altogether threw off from her any one whom she had once taken to her good graces. It must also be confessed that when she had allowed herself to hate either a man or a woman, she generally hated on to the end. No Paradise could be too charming for her friends; no Pandemonium too frightful for her enemies. In reference to Mr. Lopez she would have said, if interrogated, that she had taken the man up in obedience to her husband. But in truth she had liked the look and the voice of the man. Her husband before now had recommended men to her notice and kindness, whom at the first trial she had rejected from her good-will, and whom she had continued to reject ever afterwards, let her husband's urgency be what it might.|$|E
