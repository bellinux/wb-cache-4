500|$|Although {{saying that}} she was in favour of [...] "peaceful negotiations" [...] to end apartheid, Thatcher opposed {{sanctions}} imposed on South Africa by the Commonwealth and the EC. She attempted to preserve trade with South Africa while persuading the government there to abandon apartheid.

500|$|Speaking to The Observers Sue Arnold, Finch {{believed}} The Archers {{had done}} [...] "a great service for women's health" [...] by tackling {{the subject of}} breast cancer. Finch later revealed that she had received letters from listeners about the storyline and one woman wrote <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> <b>her</b> because she had found a lump in her breast after listening to the show. Finch also named the storyline {{as one of her}} Archers highlights. Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breakthrough said The Archers treated the subject of breast cancer [...] "as sensibly as one can reasonably expect." [...] Morgan continues saying that Breakthrough liked how the show had highlighted the effect that a cancer diagnosis can have on a partner. In contrast, the radio series Feedback reported that the storyline had initially attracted a negative response from listeners, who felt the subject should have been handled with more optimism.|$|E
500|$|On {{arriving}} back in England, Trenchard visited Lady Dudley <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> <b>her</b> {{and then set}} about engineering his return to South Africa. [...] His lung was not fully healed, causing him pain and leaving him breathless. [...] Furthermore, the War Office were sceptical about Trenchard's claim to be fully fit and were disinclined {{to allow him to}} forgo his remaining nine months of sick leave. [...] Trenchard then took several months of tennis coaching in order to strengthen his remaining lung. [...] Early in the summer of 1901 he entered two tennis competitions, reaching the semi-finals both times and gaining favourable press coverage. [...] He then sent the newspaper clippings to the doctors at the War Office, arguing that this tennis ability proved he was fit for active service. [...] Not waiting for a reply, Trenchard boarded a troop ship in May 1901, passing himself off as a volunteer for a second tour of duty.|$|E
500|$|The subplot with Stan getting beat up by {{his sister}} Shelley came from Parker's real-life {{experiences}} getting beat up as a child by his sister, also named Shelley, who is three years his elder. Parker said although his sister would later deny it, she regularly beat him up or locked {{him out of the}} house for hours; Parker stated that the scene when Stan says [...] "You're my sister and I love you" [...] in order to try to avoid a beating, but was subsequently beat even harder, was based on an actual experience with his sister. The scene in which Stan asks the giant mutant Stan to attack Shelley is based on Parker's childhood fantasy of having a larger version of himself beat up his sister. The resolution to the subplot, in which Shelley takes the blame for Stan's mistakes, and then beats up Stan when he tries <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> <b>her,</b> was also based on experiences Parker had when his sister would bail him out of trouble.|$|E
