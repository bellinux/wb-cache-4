5|$|Playing as the Rays' primary catcher, on April 4 he went 2-5 with a <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> in a {{win over}} the Texas Rangers. Two weeks later he hit two home runs with six RBIs in a 16-1 win over the New York Yankees. In May, Hanigan, plagued for nearly two weeks by a {{strained}} hamstring, was finally placed on the 15-day DL on May 28. On June 17 he had a home run and a walk against the Baltimore Orioles, but he then missed several more games due to neck stiffness and later with soreness in his left side.|$|E
5|$|On January 26, 2012, Ross {{finalized}} {{a one-year}} contract with the Boston Red Sox. He was supposed to provide depth off the bench, but injuries, particularly to Carl Crawford, led to him holding a starting role for the entire season. He started almost every day for Boston in all three outfield positions, but mainly right field. On April 14, Ross hit his first home run in a Red Sox uniform, a two-run shot off the Tampa Bay Rays's Dane De La Rosa in a 13–5 Red Sox victory. The next day, Ross hit a <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> {{in the bottom of}} the second inning off Matt Moore in a 6–4 victory over the Rays. On May 18, 2012, Ross suffered a fractured foot after fouling a ball off his foot. He was placed on the disabled list and expected to miss from six to eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|Following their four-game {{sweep of}} Milwaukee in the {{beginning}} of September, the Phillies recorded their first playoff win since their 1993 World Series appearance on October 1, defeating the Brewers in Game 1. Cole Hamels was the victor, earning his first career playoff win. Hamels allowed no runs and two hits over his eight innings of work. Chase Utley batted in two runs, while Ryan Howard walked three times in the game. In Game 2, Shane Victorino's grand slam was all the run support starter Brett Myers needed, as he pitched seven innings and allowed only two runs. The Phillies' second consecutive victory was also supported by a pair of doubles from Victorino and from Jayson Werth. In a reversal of fortune, the Brewers scored two runs in the first inning of Game 3, and it proved to be enough to win the game. Brewers starter Dave Bush and closer Salomón Torres were able to hold off the Phillies despite a rally {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, keeping the Brewers alive for Game 4. However, the Phillies defeated the Brewers in Game 4 at Miller Park to win the series, 31. Jimmy Rollins, Jayson Werth and Pat Burrell all hit solo home runs, and Burrell contributed a <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> as well. Joe Blanton struck out seven Brewers, holding the team to one run on five hits through six innings.|$|E
50|$|On July 19 versus St. Louis, he belted {{his first}} career grand slam. The {{following}} day, Hyzdu established career-highs with four hits, including {{a pair of}} <b>three-run</b> <b>homers,</b> and seven runs batted in.|$|R
5000|$|May 28 - The Cubs offense {{finally came}} alive as it homered three times off of Dodger ace Clayton Kershaw, but Jon Lester {{gave up a}} pair of <b>three-run</b> <b>homers</b> and the Cubs were swept out of LA losing 9-4. Willson Contreras, Javier Báez, and Anthony Rizzo homered for the Cubs in the losing effort.|$|R
5000|$|On July 28, , Clendenon set a Mets {{record by}} driving in seven runs {{with a pair}} of <b>three-run</b> <b>homers</b> and a {{sacrifice}} fly. The Mets were in second place, one game back of the Pirates at the end of play that day. However, they sputtered from there, ending the season in third place, six games back of the division winning Pirates. Clendenon batted [...]288 with 22 home runs for the season, and set the Mets' single season RBI record with 97.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Phillies claimed Jerome Williams off waivers and {{designated}} O'Sullivan for assignment, Williams {{started in the}} opener of a two-game series with the Angels in Los Angeles. Williams threw five shutout innings before giving up two runs in the sixth; Bastardo then gave up five more, and the Angels won 7–2. The Phillies also lost the second game, 4–3, as A. J. Burnett's inconsistency continued. The second (and final) series of the road trip pitted the Phillies against the San Francisco Giants. Hamels started game one, allowing a <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> in the fourth inning to give the Giants a 3–0 lead. The Phillies rallied, with a Marlon Byrd {{home run in the}} fifth inning and a two-run homer by Cody Asche to tie the game in the eighth. In the tenth, Chase Utley was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded (scoring one run) and Howard added a sacrifice fly to give the Phillies a 5–3 victory and Papelbon a save. In the second game, the Phillies jumped to a 5–1 lead before a sixth-inning infield error fueled a Giants rally. When Sandberg came out to remove Kendrick from the game, the pitcher stormed off the field in disgust; the Giants won, 6–5. The Phillies also lost the series' rubber match, 5–2; despite a quality start from Buchanan and Asche's three hits, the Giants had strong hitting by Michael Morse and Brandon Crawford.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{returned}} home to face the Seattle Mariners in a three-game series, and two unlikely players were key contributors in the team's win in the series opener: Jerome Williams allowed one run in seven innings and Andrés Blanco hit a <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> (his first home run in three years) to defeat the Mariners, 4–1. The next night, Burnett's struggles {{during the second half}} of the season continued as he gave up five runs in 7 innings for a 5–2 loss. The Phillies then edged the Mariners 4–3, with help from Wil Nieves (three hits) and the bullpen (Jake Diekman, Giles and Papelbon pitched four scoreless innings, striking out nine). The Phillies' home stand continued with a three-game series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Kendrick started game one; despite his continued first-inning struggles (he allowed three runs in the first, raising his season first-inning ERA to 9.69), the Phillies batted around in the third to take a 5–4 lead and strong pitching from both teams enabled them to hang on for the win. The next night, mental errors by the Phillies cost them the game 6–5 in 12 innings. Williams started the series' rubber match, continuing his effectiveness in a 7–1 win with eight strong innings and driving in a run with a suicide squeeze. The series win was the Phillies' first consecutive-series victory since April, a 33-series drought and their longest since 1996–1997.|$|E
25|$|A <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> by Freeman and a solo {{home run}} by Peterson {{led to the}} Braves {{snapping}} a 14-game losing streak at Nationals Park in an 8-5 win {{in the first of}} three games against the Nationals. A four-run rally in the ninth inning wasn't enough to overcome a five-run deficit as the Braves fell 7-6 in the second game of the series. The Braves concluded the three-game series and 10-game stretch on the road by surrendering a <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> to Anthony Rendon in a 9-1 loss to the Nationals.|$|E
50|$|On October 16, 2014, the Giants won the National League pennant on a <b>three-run</b> walk-off <b>homer</b> by Travis Ishikawa, and Fox {{broadcaster}} Joe Buck {{quoted the}} line {{as the ball}} landed in the right-field stands.|$|R
25|$|While Joel De La Cruz only {{surrendered}} {{two hits}} and five walks over 5 1/3rd innings pitched, Jaime García hit the go-ahead RBI {{with a single}} {{in the second inning}} and the Braves fell 1-0 in the first of three games against the Cardinals. <b>Three-run</b> <b>homers</b> from Freeman and García, and two-run homers from Inciarte and trade deadline acquisition Matt Kemp contributed to the Braves highest offensive output of the season in a 13-5 rout of the Cardinals. The Braves concluded the three-game road series with Foltynewicz holding the Cardinals to one run and six hits, scored his first career run and Johnson earned his eighth save of the season in a 6-3 victory.|$|R
50|$|It {{was over}} in a hurry. Bob Meusel's two-run triple and a Wally Pipp {{sacrifice}} fly made it 3-0. Then the Yankees got four more in the second, Joe Dugan's <b>three-run</b> inside-the-park <b>homer</b> the big blow. Bullet Joe Bush surrendered just three hits to the Giants, who now faced elimination.|$|R
25|$|Joaquín Andújar and Pete Vuckovich, each team's {{pitching}} aces, {{were locked}} in a scoreless pitching duel until {{the top half of}} the fifth, when Willie McGee belted a <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> for the Cards.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{giving up}} a <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> in the second inning, seven {{unanswered}} runs and a save by Mauricio Cabrera gave the Braves an 8-5 victory {{in the first of}} a four-game series against the Marlins.|$|E
25|$|On April 25, the Dodgers {{returned}} {{home for a}} four-game series against former manager Don Mattingly and the Miami Marlins. Giancarlo Stanton hit a homer in the opener as the Marlins won 3–2. He hit a <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> in the next game, capping a five-run sixth inning off Kershaw in a 6–3 comeback win for the Marlins. Justin Nicolino pitched seven and one third shutout innings as the Marlins also won game three, 2–0. The Dodgers were swept by the Marlins in a four-game series {{for the first time}} ever as Stanton homered again and they won 5–3. A <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> by Matt Kemp in the eighth inning gave the Dodgers another loss, this time to the Padres, 5–1. The Dodgers ended the month of April on a six-game losing streak, thanks to another 5–2 loss to the Padres on April 30.|$|E
5000|$|On May 7, 2015 Grandal hit two <b>three-run</b> <b>homers</b> and {{recorded}} a career high eight RBIs {{in a game}} against the Milwaukee Brewers. On June 21, Grandal became the first Dodgers catcher with two home runs and a bunt single in one game since Roy Campanella on August 30, 1955. He was selected to the National League roster for the 2015 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, his first All-Star selection. He spent {{the second half of the}} season battling shoulder inflammation that negatively affected his performance. He only had three hits in the entire month of September and finished the season hitting [...]234 with 16 home runs and 47 RBI. He had arthroscopic surgery on his shoulder at the conclusion of the season and signed a one-year, $2.8 million, contract with the Dodgers, to avoid salary arbitration.|$|R
50|$|In the 2000 National League Division Series {{against the}} New York Mets, with the Giants {{trailing}} 4-1 {{in the bottom}} of the ninth, Snow hit a <b>three-run</b> pinch-hit <b>homer</b> against Mets reliever Armando Benítez. However, the Giants failed to capitalize on their momentum, eventually falling in the 10th inning and going on to lose the series.|$|R
50|$|On August 15, Ward {{launched}} a <b>three-run</b> pinch-hit <b>homer</b> {{with one out}} {{in the ninth inning}} to lift the Cubs to a 6-5 victory over the Florida Marlins for their ninth straight road win. The Cubs had lost their last 10 games at that stadium. He became a free agent {{at the end of the}} season.|$|R
25|$|On August 12, 2011, Jones hit a <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> {{against the}} Chicago Cubs for his 1000th extra base hit. On August 19, 2011, Jones {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} return for the 2012 season, the final year on his contract, thus ending ongoing speculation about his possible retirement. On August 31, 2011, Jones hit his 450th career home run off John Lannan of the Washington Nationals.|$|E
25|$|In game four, Kershaw {{started on}} three-days rest and pitched a one-hit shutout threw {{the first six}} innings. The Dodgers took a 2–0 lead but in {{a repeat of the}} first game, it fell apart in the seventh. Matt Adams came up with two on and hit and <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> that was the decisive blow. The Cardinals won 3–2 and {{eliminated}} the Dodgers in the post-season for the second straight year.|$|E
25|$|Barajas {{made his}} Dodgers {{debut in the}} opener of a three-game series at the Milwaukee Brewers. In his debut he hit two doubles and a <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> to propel the Dodgers to a 5–3 victory. Manny Ramirez, {{activated}} from the disabled list a few days beforehand, hit two doubles in the Dodgers' 5–4 victory in the next game. The bullpen came up big in the series finale, as the Dodgers earned their first series sweep since June with a 7–1 victory.|$|E
50|$|On March 28, 2011, the Rangers traded Treanor to the Kansas City Royals {{for cash}} considerations. He was the 2011 Opening Day catcher for the Royals. On April 3, {{he hit a}} <b>three-run</b> walk-off <b>homer</b> in the 13th inning to beat the Anaheim Angels 12-9. On July 31, he {{was placed on the}} 7-day {{disabled}} list with a concussion after a collision with Matt LaPorta of the Cleveland Indians.|$|R
50|$|On {{opening day}} in 1981 vs Texas, Murcer hit a pinch-hit grand slam at Yankee Stadium. Alfonso Soriano and Russ Derry {{are the only}} other two Yankees to achieve that feat. On September 26, 1981, he hit a <b>three-run</b> pinch-hit <b>homer</b> in the 9th inning in a 6-4 Yankee win over Baltimore. In 1981, he led the pinch hitters of the American League with three home runs and 12 RBIs. He also led the club in {{slugging}} percentage (.470). He finished the season by batting as designated hitter in the 1981 World Series.|$|R
25|$|The team limped home on August 2 to open {{a four-game}} home stand against the Padres. In the opener, Hiroki Kuroda {{struggled}} as the Dodgers losing streak hit six with a 10–5 loss. Matt Kemp had four hits in four at-bats in the game. The Dodgers finally snapped the losing streak the next night as Ted Lilly made an impressive Dodgers debut. Lilly retired 20 straight after allowing a 1st-inning home run to Miguel Tejada. A two-run double by Russell Martin in the 2nd inning was all the offense the Dodgers could muster {{but it was enough}} to pick up a 2–1 victory. The victory did not come without a cost however, as Martin suffered a season-ending injury when he tore the labrum in his right knee during a collision at home plate. With backup catcher Brad Ausmus in the lineup, the Dodgers picked up a 9–0 victory on August 4. Vicente Padilla took a no-hitter into the seventh inning and pitched a complete game, two-hit shutout. The following day, the offense once more went into hibernation as the Dodgers dropped the series finale, 5–0. In the opener of a three-game series against the Washington Nationals, Kershaw struck out nine but allowed two <b>three-run</b> <b>homers</b> to Adam Dunn and the Dodgers lost 6–3. The Dodgers won the following day, on a walk-off single by James Loney in the 10th for a 3–2 victory. The Dodgers concluded the home stand with an 8–3 Sunday afternoon win over the Nationals, handing Ted Lilly his second victory since joining the Dodgers.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} of a three-game road series against the Mets on September 19, the Braves put up seven runs, {{including}} a solo homer by Freeman, and Blair surrendered just two runs off four hits in six innings pitched to earn his first victory of the season in a 7-3 win over the Mets. In the second game, the Braves put up five runs, including a <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> in the seventh inning by Garcia, and Johnson earned the save to win series in a 5-4 victory over the Mets. The Mets jumped to a three-run lead in the final game of the series, but the Braves rallied back with four unanswered runs, which included a two-run homer by Anthony Recker in the seventh inning, {{to take the lead in}} the top of the ninth. In an almost exact repeat of the night before, Braves closer Johnson faced off against Cespedes with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. Cespedes hit the ball to deep right-center and had the distance for a <b>three-run</b> <b>homer,</b> but center fielder Inciarte raced towards the wall, made the jump and caught the ball above the fence to get the final out for a 4-3 Braves victory in their final game of the season against the Mets.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{loading the}} bases {{in both the}} first and second innings, the Braves were unable to score a run and {{surrendered}} five runs in those first two innings in a 7-2 loss in the first of three games against the Giants. A <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> by Kemp in the fourth inning and one run surrendered in 7 2/3rd innings pitched by Foltynewicz was enough to secure a 3-1 win for the Braves in the second game of the series. The Braves concluded the series by surrendering four homers in a 13-4 loss to the Giants.|$|E
25|$|In Game 1, Larry Herndon hit {{a two-run}} home run {{that gave the}} Tigers a 3–2 lead. Morris pitched a {{complete}} game with 2 runs on 8 hits, and Detroit drew first blood. The Padres evened the series the next night despite pitcher Ed Whitson being chased after pitching two-thirds of an inning and giving up three runs on five Tiger hits. Tiger starter Dan Petry exited the game after four and one-third innings when Kurt Bevacqua's <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> gave San Diego a 5–3 lead they would hold onto.|$|E
50|$|Nehf {{also was}} {{involved}} {{in one of the}} strangest innings in World Series history. Charlie Root was the Cubs' starting pitcher for Game 4 of the 1929 World Series at Shibe Park and was cruising along with an 8-0 lead against the Philadelphia Athletics. In the seventh inning, Nehf was brought in from the bullpen after the Athletics cut the lead to 8-4. The first batter he faced, Mule Haas, hit a fly ball that Hack Wilson lost in the sun. It ended up a <b>three-run</b> inside-the-park <b>homer</b> for Haas, and the A's went on to a 10-run inning. The Cubs lost the game 10-8 and lost the World Series two days later.|$|R
50|$|He played most of {{his prime}} in the dead-ball era, as the third baseman on several {{successful}} Red Sox teams. He helped the Red Sox to victories in the 1912, 1915, and 1916 World Series. He led Boston with 5 RBIs in the 1912 Series and hit his team's only home run. In the famous 10th inning of the final game, the same inning that included Fred Snodgrass and Chief Meyers making critical fielding mistakes and giving the Red Sox two extra outs to work with, it was Gardner who drove in Steve Yerkes with the series-winning sacrifice fly. Gardner homered in consecutive games of the '16 Series, including a <b>three-run</b> inside-the-park <b>homer</b> in Game 4. The two home runs matched his regular season total.|$|R
50|$|Cleveland's slim chances at a {{comeback}} took a beating as the Indians fell hopelessly behind 7-0. Almost everything went wrong from the start, {{a pair of}} errors resulting in two New York runs in the second. A single by Mays in the next inning scored another run. Then the game broke wide open in the fifth. Lemon loaded the bases and was pulled. Hal Newhouser replaced him but got nobody out, giving up a walk to Thompson and single to Irvin. A brief glimmer of hope for the home team came {{in the bottom of}} the fifth with a couple of Giant errors and a Hank Majeski <b>three-run</b> pinch <b>homer.</b> But except for a meaningless RBI single by Rudy Regalado in the seventh off Don Liddle, the Indians got nothing more as Wilhelm and Game 2 starter Antonelli came on in relief and the Giants completed a four-game sweep.|$|R
25|$|Bellinger {{then drove}} in the go-ahead {{run with a}} double {{in the top of}} the ninth off of Giles and the Dodgers added four more runs on a {{sacrifice}} fly by Austin Barnes and a <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> by Pederson. Bregman homered off of Jansen in the bottom of the ninth but the Dodgers managed to even up the series. The Astros had two hits in the game; both were home runs. This was the first game in World Series history where both starting pitchers allowed four or fewer baserunners.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{dropped their}} third {{straight}} on the opener {{of a road}} series against the New York Mets, 6–3 as Jason Pridie hit a <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> off Kuorda with two outs in the sixth inning. Ethier's hitting streak finally ended on May 7, when he went 0 for 4 against the Mets. He finished with a 30-game hitting streak, second most in Dodgers history behind the 31 game streak by Willie Davis in 1969. The game was doubly disappointing as the Dodgers losing streak hit 4 with a 4–2 loss. Clayton Kershaw pitched 6 2/3 strong innings and Andre Ethier hit a two-run homer to end the losing streak with a 4–2 win. The Dodgers road woes continued on May 9, when Manager Don Mattingly and third baseman Juan Uribe were both ejected after a bad umpire call in the eighth and the Pirates scored three runs in the next half inning to beat the Dodgers 4–1. The Dodgers picked up a big win the next day as Matt Kemp broke open a scoreless tie with a <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> in the sixth inning and the Dodgers offense took off for a 10–3 win. The Dodgers {{took the lead in}} the series on May 11 as they shut out the Pirates 2–0 thanks to an excellent start by Hiroki Kuroda, who struck out eight in seven innings. The Dodgers finale against the Pirates was called off due to rain after two innings with the Dodgers leading 1–0. The game would eventually be made up on September 1.|$|E
25|$|The Braves {{opened up}} their next road series by {{surrendering}} a <b>three-run</b> <b>homer</b> {{in the sixth}} inning and falling 6-3 to the Rockies. Despite loading the bases with one out in the ninth inning, the Braves were unable to capitalize and fell 4-3 to the Rockies. Teherán exited {{the game in the}} fifth inning with upper back discomfort. What had started as a strong outing for Wisler with only surrendering two hits after five innings pitched turned into a five-run collapse in the sixth inning as the Braves fell 8-4 to the Rockies. The Braves concluded the four-game series by surrendering seven runs, including a home run, in a 7-2 loss to the Rockies.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, at 30 years old, Warren Cromartie {{became the}} first, {{and perhaps the}} most prominent, American player still in his prime to sign with a Japanese {{baseball}} team when he joined the Yomiuri Giants before the 1984 NPB season. In , Cromartie batted [...]378 with 15 home runs and 78 RBIs to be named MVP of the Central League, and lead his team to the Japan Series championship. In the deciding game of the series with the Kintetsu Buffaloes, Cromartie doubled in the fourth inning to ignite a <b>three-run</b> rally and <b>homered</b> in the seventh.|$|R
5000|$|On July 6, in Colorado, the Cardinals {{suffered}} one of {{the worst}} ninth-inning collapses in franchise history. Leading 9-3 going {{into the bottom of the}} ninth, Dennys Reyes and Ryan Franklin combined to give up nine runs to the Rockies, with Seth Smith's <b>three-run</b> walk-off <b>homer</b> capping an amazing 12-9 Colorado victory. It was the first time in 51 years that the Cardinals allowed nine runs in the ninth inning, and the first time St. Louis lost a game it led by seven runs or more since 1998. It also was the first time all season the Cardinals lost a game when they were leading after eight innings. Previously, they were a perfect 38-0. The next night, the Cardinals followed up that collapse by blowing leads of 5-0 and 7-4, losing to the Rockies 8-7 on another walk-off homer, this one by Chris Iannetta. [...] After the Rockies completed a three-game sweep the next day, the Cardinals traveled to Houston and took two of three to go into the All-Star Break with a 47-41 record, one game behind the first-place Cincinnati Reds.|$|R
50|$|Yankees manager Casey Stengel {{gave the}} ball to unheralded pitcher Jim McDonald for Game 5 and, while he gave up a dozen hits, he got them a win. Brooklyn starter Johnny Podres was jolted by a Gene Woodling home run to begin the game. Podres was chased in a five-run third, and the first man his {{replacement}} Russ Meyer would face, Mickey Mantle, greeted the reliever with a grand slam home run. The Yankees were coasting 10-2 until the eighth, when McDonald tired and gave up a <b>three-run</b> Billy Cox <b>homer.</b> He was relieved by Bob Kuzava, and in the ninth, Allie Reynolds {{was brought in to}} retire Jackie Robinson for the final out.|$|R
