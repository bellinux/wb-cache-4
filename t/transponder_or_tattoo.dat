50|$|Analog {{satellite}} television and terrestrial analog microwave relay communications rely on subcarriers transmitted with the video carrier on a satellite <b>transponder</b> <b>or</b> microwave channel for the audio channels {{of a video}} feed. There are usually at frequencies of 5.8, 6.2, or 6.8 MHz (the video carrier usually resides below 5 MHz on a satellite <b>transponder</b> <b>or</b> microwave relay). Extra subcarriers are sometimes transmitted at around 7 or 8 MHz for extra audio (such as radio stations) or low-to-medium-speed data. This {{is referred to as}} multiple channel per carrier (MCPC).|$|R

50|$|The system {{relies on}} two {{avionics}} components—a high-integrity GPS navigation source and a datalink (ADS-B unit). There are {{several types of}} certified ADS-B data links, but the most common ones operate at 1090 MHz, essentially a modified Mode S <b>transponder,</b> <b>or</b> at 978 MHz. The FAA {{would like to see}} aircraft that exclusively operate below 18000 ft use the 978 MHz link since this will help alleviate further congestion of the 1090 MHz frequency. To obtain ADS-B Out capability at 1090 MHz, one can install a new <b>transponder</b> <b>or</b> modify an existing transponder if the manufacturer offers an ADS-B upgrade, plus install a certified GPS position source if one is not already present.|$|R

5000|$|SR 878's tolls {{are entirely}} electronic: cash cannot be {{accepted}} along its length. Payment is done either via SunPass <b>transponders</b> <b>or</b> via toll-by-plate billing, {{the latter of}} which attracts a higher cost. Two toll gantries are located along the Snapper Creek Expressway, the first between the Don Shula Expressway and Galloway Road, and the second between Galloway Road and Southwest 72nd Avenue. The relationship between the tolling points and interchanges along SR 878 and SR 874 is that all motorists are charged at least one toll for using the road; there are no [...] "free sections". As of July 1, 2013, the cost for a two-axle vehicle to travel {{the entire length of}} the Snapper Creek Expressway is $0.50 with a SunPass <b>transponder,</b> <b>or</b> $1.00 via the toll-by-plate program. Each additional axle on a vehicle attracts an extra $0.25 via SunPass or $0.50 via toll-by-plate for each toll gantry passed.|$|R
