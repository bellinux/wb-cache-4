5|$|A 2002 {{scheme to}} underfund {{pensions}} for city employees {{led to the}} San Diego pension scandal. This resulted in the resignation of newly re-elected Mayor Dick Murphy and the criminal indictment of six pension board members. <b>Those</b> <b>charges</b> were finally dismissed {{by a federal judge}} in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Before the American Revolution, Hancock {{was one of}} {{the wealthiest}} men in the Thirteen Colonies, having {{inherited}} a profitable mercantile business from his uncle. He began his political career in Boston as a protégé of Samuel Adams, an influential local politician, though the two men later became estranged. Hancock used his wealth to support the colonial cause as tensions increased between colonists and Great Britain in the 1760s. He became very popular in Massachusetts, especially after British officials seized his sloop Liberty in 1768 and charged him with smuggling. <b>Those</b> <b>charges</b> were eventually dropped; he has often been described as a smuggler in historical accounts, but the accuracy of this characterization has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|The Ashley Smith inquest was an Ontario coroner's inquest {{into the}} death of Ashley Smith, a {{teenager}} who died by self-inflicted strangulation on 19 October 2007 while under suicide watch in custody at the Grand Valley Institution for Women. Despite guards watching her on video monitors, Smith was able to strangle herself with a strip of cloth, and it was 45 minutes before guards or supervisors entered her cell and confirmed her death. The warden and deputy warden were fired after the incident; although the four guards and supervisors in immediate contact with Smith were initially charged with negligent homicide, <b>those</b> <b>charges</b> were withdrawn a year later. Smith's family brought {{a lawsuit against the}} Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) for negligence; this lawsuit was settled out of court in May 2011.|$|E

5|$|Schindler {{was arrested}} twice on {{suspicion}} of black market activities and once for breaking the Nuremberg Laws by kissing a Jewish girl, an action forbidden by the Race and Resettlement Act. The first arrest, in late 1941, led to him being kept overnight. His secretary arranged for his release through Schindler's influential contacts in the Nazi Party. His second arrest, on 29 April 1942, {{was the result of}} his kissing a Jewish girl on the cheek at his birthday party at the factory the previous day. He remained in jail five days before his influential Nazi contacts were able to obtain his release. The third arrest, where he was accused of black marketeering and bribing Göth and others to improve the conditions of the Jewish workers, took place in October 1944. He was held for most of a week and released. Göth had been arrested on 13 September 1944 for corruption and other abuses of power, and Schindler's arrest was part of the ongoing investigation into Göth's activities. Göth was never convicted on <b>those</b> <b>charges,</b> but was hanged by the Supreme National Tribunal of Poland for war crimes on 13 September 1946.|$|E
5|$|Several {{investigations}} ensued, including by the U.S. Congress and the three-person, Reagan-appointed Tower Commission. Neither {{found any}} evidence that President Reagan himself knew {{of the extent of}} the multiple programs. Ultimately the sale of weapons to Iran was not deemed a criminal offense but charges were brought against five individuals for their support of the Contras. <b>Those</b> <b>charges,</b> however, were later dropped because the administration refused to declassify certain documents. The indicted conspirators faced various lesser charges instead. In the end, fourteen administration officials were indicted, including then-Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. Eleven convictions resulted, some of which were vacated on appeal. The rest of those indicted or convicted were all pardoned {{in the final days of}} the presidency of George H.W. Bush, who had been Vice President at the time of the affair. The Iran-Contra Affair and the ensuing deception to protect senior administration officials including President Reagan has been cast as an example of post-truth politics.|$|E

25|$|One alleged {{example of}} the Church's {{possible}} brainwashing tactics is the Rehabilitation Project Force, to which church staff are assigned to work off alleged wrongdoings under conditions that many critics characterize as degrading.

Articles that claim to rebut <b>those</b> <b>charges</b> include Juha Pentikäinen's The Church of Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Pennsylvania {{discovered}} its state workers had overpaid federal taxes due to errors in state withholding.

25|$|On 27 March 2015, Italy's highest court, the Court of Cassation, {{ruled that}} Knox and Sollecito were {{innocent}} of murder, thereby definitively ending the case. Rather than merely declaring {{that there were}} errors in the earlier court cases or that there was insufficient evidence to convict, {{the court ruled that}} Knox and Sollecito had not committed the murder and were innocent of <b>those</b> <b>charges,</b> but it upheld Knox's conviction for slandering Patrick Lumumba.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Giovanni Falcone {{signed an}} arrest warrant in Italy for the three {{brothers}} on drug trafficking charges.

In March 1980, Rosario and his brother Joseph were arrested by American authorities for alleged participation {{in an attempt to}} import 91 pounds of heroin from Milan, Italy. They were both acquitted of <b>those</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} a card payment system as a two-sided market that allows for partial participation by heterogeneous consumers and merchants. Taking into account the strategic effects arising from competition between merchants, the model is used to characterize the optimal structure of fees between <b>those</b> <b>charged</b> to cardholders and <b>those</b> <b>charged</b> to merchants and, more specifically, the level of the interchange fee that banks charge each other. The results modify the existing characterizations of the interchange fee, and explain the source of potential deviations between the privately and socially optimal level of the fee.

25|$|In November 1992, Durousseau {{enlisted in}} the U.S. Army and was {{stationed}} in Germany, where he met Natoca, who would later become his wife. The two married in 1995 in Las Vegas. In 1996, they were transferred to Fort Benning, Georgia. On March 13, 1997, Durousseau was arrested for kidnapping and raping a young woman. However, in August of that year he was cleared of <b>those</b> <b>charges.</b> Soon after, he was found in possession of stolen goods. He was court-martialed in January 1999, found guilty and dishonorably discharged from the Army.|$|E
25|$|However, some British works {{suggest that}} the 'Kashmir State was not in anybody's mind' when the Award was being drawn and that even the Pakistanis {{themselves}} had not realized the importance of Gurdaspur to Kashmir until the Indian forces actually entered Kashmir.
