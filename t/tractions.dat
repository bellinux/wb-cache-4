2500|$|The {{classical}} {{theory of}} contact {{focused primarily on}} non-adhesive contact where no tension force is allowed to occur within the contact area, i.e., contacting bodies can be separated without adhesion forces. [...] Several analytical and numerical approaches {{have been used to}} solve contact problems that satisfy the no-adhesion condition. [...] Complex forces and moments are transmitted between the bodies where they touch, so problems in contact mechanics can become quite sophisticated. [...] In addition, the contact stresses are usually a nonlinear function of the deformation. [...] To simplify the solution procedure, a frame of reference is usually defined in which the objects (possibly in motion relative to one another) are static. They interact through surface <b>tractions</b> (or pressures/stresses) at their interface.|$|E

The idea behind the company was a public-spirited one, to give the citizens cheaper and better service, by a more modern equipment, by a wider system of transfer. It seems to me, Mr. Hodder, that you put yourself in a more quixotic position than the so-called reformers when you assume that the men who organize a company in good faith are personally responsible for every share of stock that is sold, and {{for the welfare of}} every individual who may buy the stock.

I made up my mind if I went down to see him and told him about it, he'd make it right.
