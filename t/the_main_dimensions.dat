The committee, consisting of {{the director of the}} Finnish Maritime Administration, Svante Sundman, and two experienced Finnish shipbuilders, K. Albin Johansson and Ossian Tybeck, delivered its final report on {{the construction of a new}} icebreaker in the following year. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the new 4,415-ton icebreaker, large enough to escort 10,000-ton dry cargo ships or 16,000-ton tankers, were based on the old Jääkarhu, but the triple-expansion steam engines were replaced with a modern diesel-electric propulsion system, similar to the 1939-built Sisu, with a combined output of 10,500 shp. In the early drafts, the new icebreaker was designed with three propellers (two in the stern and one in the bow) and an asymmetric stem that would compensate for the transverse force caused by the bow propeller. However, these features were later dropped after extensive model testing and co-operation with Swedish naval architects in favor of a completely new design.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new opinion dynamic model {{based on the}} {{experiments}} and results of Wood et al (1996). We consider pairs of individuals discussing on two attitudinal dimensions, and we suppose that one dimension is important, the other secondary. The dynamics are mainly ruled by the level of agreement on <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>dimension.</b> If two individuals are close on <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>dimension,</b> then they attract each other on <b>the</b> <b>main</b> and on <b>the</b> secondary dimensions, whatever their disagreement on the secondary dimension. If they are far from each other on <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>dimension,</b> then too much proximity on the secondary dimension is uncomfortable, and generates rejection on this dimension. The proximity is defined by comparing the opinion distance with a threshold called attraction threshold on <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>dimension</b> and rejection threshold on the secondary dimension. With such dynamics, a population with opinions initially uniformly drawn evolves {{to a set of}} clusters, inside which secondary opinions fluctuate more or less depending on threshold values. We observe that a low attraction threshold favours fluctuations on the secondary dimension, especially when the rejection threshold is high. The opinion evolutions of the model can be related to some stylised facts. 1...|$|R

40|$|The paper brings {{theoretical}} and empirical contributions to the scholarship on dimensions of politics in Europe.

We trace the origin of this difference in the 1990 s when parties in Eastern Europe chose to emphasize cultural issues to appeal to an electorate unfamiliar with capitalist economics and dissatisfied with the economic left associated with Communism and the economic right associated with painful reforms. To test this assertion we apply the Optimal Classification vote scaling method to an original dataset of over 24, 000 votes from 22 European parliaments; the statistical tests support the hypothesis...|$|R
