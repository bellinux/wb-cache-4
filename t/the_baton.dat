5|$|Competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics, Gay ran {{the third}} leg for the USA relay 4 x 100 meters team. The team {{consisted}} of Justin Gatlin, Mike Rodgers, Trayvon Bromell, and Gay. The team finished third, behind Jamaica and Japan. However, Gay once again {{was stripped of}} an Olympic medal, as the American team was disqualified for Justin Gatlin committing a violation. The rule cited was 170.7, which deals with <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> exchange; when Rodgers passed <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> to Gatlin, <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> touched Gatlin's hand before it reached the exchange zone. The American 4 × 100 m relay team was disqualified in Rio, hence making Tyson Gay the fastest man in history to not win a medal at the Olympics. As a result, the Canadian team anchored by Andre de Grasse was awarded bronze.|$|E
5|$|Due to an {{accidental}} {{killing of a}} teenage girl while trying to shoot a psychotic suspect, the Tainan City Police Bureau {{made a decision to}} develop a special kind of baton in 2006. When dealing with suspects without firearms, the police officers are expected to use <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> first in order to reduce accidents. To commemorate the girl who died, mayor Hsu named <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> after her.|$|E
5|$|Relay {{races are}} the only track and field event in which a team of runners {{directly}} compete against other teams. Typically, a team {{is made up of}} four runners of the same sex. Each runner completes their specified distance (referred to as a leg) before handing over a baton to a teammate, who then begins their leg upon receiving <b>the</b> <b>baton.</b> There is usually a designated area where athletes must exchange <b>the</b> <b>baton.</b> Teams may be disqualified if they fail to complete the change within the area, or if <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> is dropped during the race. A team may also be disqualified if its runners are deemed to have wilfully impeded other competitors.|$|E
5000|$|All <b>the</b> <b>batons,</b> except Erich Raeder's, were {{designed}} {{in a similar}} way: a shaft decorated with Iron Crosses and [...] Luftwaffe (air force) shafts showed the Balkenkreuz ("beam cross"), whereas Kriegsmarine (navy) shafts had fouled anchors. The ends of <b>the</b> <b>batons</b> were decorated with ornate caps.|$|R
50|$|Team A throws <b>the</b> six <b>batons</b> (called Kastpinne/Kastpinnar in Swedish) {{from their}} baseline, at their opponent's lined-up kubbs (called Baseline kubbs). Throws must be under-handed, and <b>the</b> <b>batons</b> must spin end over end. Throwing batons overhand, {{sideways}} or spinning them side-to-side (helicopter) is not allowed.|$|R

5|$|The Queen's Baton Relay, is a relay {{around the}} world held prior to the {{beginning}} of the Commonwealth Games. <b>The</b> <b>Baton</b> carries a message from the Head of the Commonwealth, currently Queen Elizabeth II. The Relay traditionally begins at Buckingham Palace in London as a part of the city's Commonwealth Day festivities. The Queen entrusts <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> to the first relay runner. At the Opening Ceremony of the Games, the final relay runner hands <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> back to the Queen or her representative, who reads the message aloud to officially open the Games.The Queen's Baton Relay is similar to the Olympic Torch Relay.|$|E

5|$|On 12 November 1880 Wagner {{conducted}} a private {{performance of the}} prelude for his patron Ludwig II of Bavaria at the Court Theatre in Munich. The premiere of the entire work was given in the Festspielhaus at Bayreuth on 26 July 1882 under <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> of the Jewish-born German conductor Hermann Levi. Stage designs were by Max Brückner and Paul von Joukowsky who took their lead from Wagner himself. The Grail hall {{was based on the}} interior of Siena Cathedral which Wagner had visited in 1880, while Klingsor's magic garden was modelled on those at the Palazzo Rufolo in Ravello. In July and August 1882 sixteen performances of the work were given in Bayreuth conducted by Levi and Franz Fischer. The production boasted an orchestra of 107, a chorus of 135 and 23 soloists (with the main parts being double cast). At the last of these performances, Wagner took <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> from Levi and conducted the final scene of act 3 from the orchestral interlude to the end.|$|E

5|$|The libertines' {{downfall}} {{began with}} the February 1555 elections. By then, many of the French refugees had been granted citizenship and with their support, Calvin's partisans elected {{the majority of the}} syndics and the councillors. On 16 May the libertines took to the streets in a drunken protest and attempted to burn down a house that was supposedly full of Frenchmen. The syndic Henri Aulbert tried to intervene, carrying with him <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> of office that symbolised his power. Perrin seized <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> and waved it over the crowd, which gave the appearance that he was taking power and initiating a coup d'état. The insurrection was soon over when another syndic appeared and ordered Perrin to go with him to the town hall. Perrin and other leaders were forced to flee the city. With the approval of Calvin, the other plotters who remained in the city were found and executed. The opposition to Calvin's church polity came to an end.|$|E
5|$|Wagner {{completed}} Parsifal in January 1882, and {{a second}} Bayreuth Festival was held for the new opera, which premiered on 26 May.

5|$|A video by Ken McCallum, a {{cameraman}} for Channel4 News, was broadcast on 8 April. Shot {{from a different}} angle, the footage shows Harwood draw his arm back to head height before bringing <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> down on Tomlinson's legs. McCallum was filming another incident at the time; the Tomlinson incident was unfolding in the background, unseen by the journalists but recorded by the camera. Half an hour later Alex Thomson, chief correspondent of Channel4 News, was doing a live broadcast when the camera was damaged. It took engineers days to recover the tape, which is when they saw that Tomlinson's assault was on it.|$|E
50|$|The Duke of Wellington possessed {{multiple}} batons, {{since he}} held the rank of field marshal or equivalent in eight European armies each of which presented him with a baton.

5|$|As well as {{performing}} {{new works}} dedicated to him, Szigeti also championed {{the music of}} other contemporary composers, notably Sergei Prokofiev and Igor Stravinsky. He {{was among the first}} violinists to make Prokofiev's First Violin Concerto a standard part of his repertoire, and frequently performed and recorded works of Stravinsky (including the Duo Concertante, recorded with the composer at the piano in 1945.) The Berg Violin Concerto he even recorded twice, under <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> of Dimitri Mitropoulos. Most famously, Szigeti recorded the Bloch concerto, a premier recording made in 1939 with the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire conducted by Charles Munch (originally released on Columbia LP and reissued on Membran CD).|$|E
5|$|The first Guardian video shows {{one officer}} lunge at Tomlinson from behind, strike {{him across the}} legs with a baton and push his back, causing him to fall.

After he is hit, he can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side}} of his forehead; eyewitnesses spoke of hearing a noise as his head hit the ground.|$|E
5|$|The first {{performance}} of Falstaff was at La Scala in Milan on 9 February 1893, nearly {{six years after}} Verdi's previous premiere.

The performance was a huge success under <b>the</b> <b>baton</b> of Edoardo Mascheroni; numbers were encored, {{and at the end}} the applause for Verdi and the cast lasted an hour.
