5|$|After his discharge, Robinson briefly {{returned}} to his old football club, the Los Angeles Bulldogs. Robinson then accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor Rev. Karl Downs to be <b>the</b> <b>athletic</b> <b>director</b> at Sam Huston College in Austin, then of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. The job included coaching the school's basketball team for the 1944–45 season. As it was a fledgling program, few students tried out for the basketball team, and Robinson even resorted to inserting himself into the lineup for exhibition games. Although his teams were outmatched by opponents, Robinson was respected as a disciplinarian coach, and drew the admiration of, among others, Langston University basketball player Marques Haynes, a future member of the Harlem Globetrotters.|$|E

5|$|Demand {{for tickets}} by Alabama fans {{was so great}} that the Alabama ticket office accidentally {{oversold}} its allotment of tickets. The office neglected to limit purchases on the forms sent to season-ticket holders, and the office received more than 25,000 orders for its 12,500-ticket allotment. An additional 2,000 tickets were given to Alabama, but the school still had to send out more than 10,000 refunds. Alabama's athletics director was heavily criticized for overselling the ticket allotment and for limiting ticket distribution to fans who had contributed large amounts of money to the athletics department. A group of fans disgruntled at the ticket distribution process eventually levied a class-action lawsuit against <b>the</b> <b>athletic</b> <b>director,</b> claiming contract violations.|$|E

40|$|Unlike {{the years}} of formal {{academic}} preparation possessed by individuals in most professions, {{the large majority of}} current collegiate <b>athletic</b> <b>directors</b> have not had formal academic training which was designed to professionally prepare them for their varying administrative tasks. A few years back then were only a few institutions of higher education that had established graduate programs in <b>athletic</b> administration. <b>The</b> number was small compared to approximantly one thousand institutions that employed <b>athletic</b> <b>directors</b> and associate directors. Also, nearly all high schools in this country have an <b>athletic</b> <b>director.</b> <b>The</b> lack of specific academic preparation of <b>the</b> <b>athletic</b> <b>directors,</b> <b>the</b> trend in the job market to employ those individuals who had sound administrative abilities, and the number of institutions that were providing programs in <b>the</b> <b>athletic</b> administration created <b>the</b> need for additional professional preparation programs designed to train present and future administrators. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess selected educational, professional and personal characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>athletic</b> <b>directors</b> at <b>the</b> selected institutions today. Also, to compare those characteristics by the type of the institution (public or private and divisional membership in <b>the</b> National Collegiate <b>Athletic</b> Association), and to determine from the above, recommendations for those seeking employment as <b>athletic</b> <b>directors</b> and to make suggestions for improving educational programs for those individuals aspiring to become an <b>athletic</b> <b>director.</b> This study will provide useful information for those seeking employment as <b>athletic</b> <b>directors.</b> <b>The</b> methodology to be used in this study will involve the development and validation of an inquiry form for <b>the</b> <b>athletic</b> <b>directors,</b> <b>the</b> procurement of the information from <b>the</b> <b>athletic</b> <b>directors</b> in <b>the</b> study population, and finally the analysis of the data obtained by the inquiry form.

5|$|His {{friendship}} with Bears teammate Brian Piccolo, {{who died of}} cancer in 1970, inspired Sayers to write his autobiography, I Am Third, which in turn was the basis for the 1971 made-for-TV movie Brian's Song. Sayers was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977 at age 34, and remains the youngest person to receive the honor. He was named to the NFL's 75th Anniversary Team as a halfback and kick returner, the only player to occupy two positions on the team. For his achievements in college, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame the same year. His jersey number is retired by both the Bears and the University of Kansas. Following his NFL career, Sayers began a career in sports administration and business, and served as <b>the</b> <b>athletic</b> <b>director</b> of Southern Illinois University from 1976 to 1981.|$|E
5|$|Mike McCormack, a Hall of Fame lineman for the Cleveland Browns {{and former}} coach and {{executive}} for the Seattle Seahawks, was the Panthers' first team president, presiding {{in that role}} from 1994 {{until his retirement in}} 1997; McCormack was inducted as the first person in the Carolina Panthers Hall of Honor later that year. Jerry Richardson's son, Mark, was appointed as the team's second president in 1997 and served in that role until he stepped down in 2009. His brother Jon, who had been president of Bank of America Stadium, stepped down at the same time. The resignations of Mark and Jon Richardson were unexpected, as it was thought that the two would eventually take over the team from their father. Mark Richardson was replaced by Danny Morrison, who had previously served as <b>the</b> <b>athletic</b> <b>director</b> of both Texas Christian University and Wofford College, Richardson's alma mater.|$|E
