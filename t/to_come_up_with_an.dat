Various landmarks, such as the kiosk and the bridge, were missing, and the grounds were full of people. Trying <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> explanation, they {{wondered}} if they had stumbled across a private party or an event booked that day. However, they found that nothing had been booked that afternoon.

5|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, Homer and Bart exit the Magic Palace's gift shop, only {{to end up in}} another gift shop. The scene was based on an {{experience}} of the episode's show runner Mike Scully, who, in order to exit the Lance Burton Theatre after a magic show, had to pass through a gift shop. The ending scene of the episode went through several changes and was as a result completed late in the episode's production. The writers had conceived the courtroom scene, but they were stuck trying <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ending after Skinner had been shot. They eventually decided that the trial was a scam staged by the townspeople, and Simpsons writer George Meyer pitched the surfing scene that closed the episode.|$|E
5|$|Suzy gets {{a job at}} {{a burger}} joint, and moves into an {{abandoned}} boiler, with entry through the attached pipe.

Some weeks pass, and Joe the Mexican woos Suzy. He has no success, and his attempts irritate Doc. The next day, Doc himself approaches the pipe with flowers in hand ("How Long?"), still uncertain as to why he is seeking a girl like Suzy. Suzy lets him in the boiler, which she has fitted up in a homelike manner. She is doing well at the burger joint, but is grateful to Fauna for giving her confidence. She is confident enough, indeed, to reject Doc, who is unhappy, but philosophical ("The Next Time It Happens").|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} {{writing the}} dialogue, Takumi was called into another meeting with Inaba, {{and was told}} to add a new gameplay mechanic to the investigations. Takumi {{wanted to keep the}} gameplay simple enough for his mother {{to be able to play}} it, and keep it focused on the core concept of finding lies; according to him, he immediately had a vision of the psyche lock system during the meeting with Inaba, but still asked for three days <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> idea. He found it easy to formulate the idea, but it took over a month to create the system; the biggest problem was how to visually represent the psyche locks. Takumi also drew storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consisted of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening. He also drew rough sketches of cut-in illustrations; it was only decided after all the text had been written what scenes would have illustrations made for them. While the game's opening features the judge, it was originally supposed to have featured a demon instead; this was because Takumi was playing Devil May Cry at the time, and had liked its opening. As Takumi wanted the first three Ace Attorney games to be part of one larger work, he did not want the first game to look outdated in comparison to later ones, so it was decided to keep the same graphics for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth throughout all their appearances, and not make updates to them. The game's music was composed by Naoto Tanaka under the pseudonym Akemi Kimura.|$|E

Thinking of Keith's character in The Good Life, Spence had {{the idea of an}} upper-class version of Margo Leadbetter and, from the account from the comedian, came up with Audrey fforbes-Hamilton. Instead of a Cockney comedian as the new owner of the manor, Spence decided on an American who sees the manor while in England looking for his roots. The American later discovers he is descended from the fforbes-Hamiltons. This was made into a radio pilot in 1976 with Bernard Braden as the American, but was never broadcast because of the interest to make it into a TV series.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Sweeney {{initiated}} several programs intended {{to reverse the}} decline in union membership and recruit more new members, especially younger people. The AFL-CIO's organizing and field mobilization programs were separated. The Field Mobilization department was given control over the AFL-CIO's regional offices, which were reduced from 12 to four. Sweeney {{set a goal of}} spending one-third of the federation's budget on organizing by 1998. An ad hoc executive council committee was established <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> organizing strategy for the South and Southwest, while the Union Summer program was established to recruit and deploy college-age activists. A new department, the Working Women's Department, was created and charged with developing ways to give working women a voice and to inject that voice into the labor movement's deliberations.|$|E
25|$|The 1988 Chevrolet Nova added a sporty {{model to}} its lineup of subcompact {{front-wheel-drive}} cars. This new 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cam {{got its name}} from a double-overhead-cam version of the Toyota-built 1.6-liter four-cylinder. Novas continued to share their basic design with the Corolla, and this engine had previously {{been used in the}} Toyota FX-16, a performance version of the Corolla. The twin-cam produced , 36 more than its single-cam sibling. A five-speed manual transmission was standard, as in the regular Novas, but the Twin-Cam offered a four-speed automatic as an option versus the three-speed offered on other models. The more potent engine elevated the 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cam into junior sport-sedan territory, but the advancement didn't come cheaply. The base Nova listed at about $8,800, the Twin-Cam went for $11,395. That price included fuel injection, sport suspension, power steering, leather-covered steering wheel, tachometer, four-wheel disc brakes, and wider tires on aluminum wheels, but it was a stiff tariff, and few were ordered (approximately 3,300 Twin-Cam models were built). There were no color choices; all 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cams wore black metallic paint with a grey interior; and there was no hatchback version offered. Every 1988 Chevrolet Nova got rear shoulder belts, rear window defogger, and AM/FM stereo radio as standard equipment. This was the last model year for the Nova name at Chevrolet. Starting with 1989, Chevrolet pushed this car into its new Geo division and renamed it the Prizm. Geo was Chevy's effort <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> import-sounding label to attract buyers who were not inclined to shop American.|$|E

After the picture was tinted, the faces of the four members of the band were airbrushed on from a 1969 publicity photograph. [...] Other faces added, according to Juniper, were either Miles Davis or Blind Willie Johnson, a friend of Andy Warhol (possibly Mary Woronov) and astronaut Neil Armstrong, although it is actually fellow astronaut Frank Borman. The cover also pictured the outline of a Zeppelin on a brown background (similar to the cover of the band's first album), which gave the album its nickname [...] "Brown Bomber".|$|E
500|$|Steve Kandell of New York {{magazine}} {{compared it}} to the second season episode [...] "Hunting Trip", but said [...] "Camping" [...] was [...] "somewhat more of a placeholder".

ChicagoNow writer Andy Daglas called it [...] "a fun episode, but also one that felt like sort of a pause, a chance to reset the pins". He compared the pressure on Leslie <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> idea on the harvest festival to pressure on the show's writing staff to follow up on the harvest festival story arc. The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow called it funny and charming, but also a low point in the season following seven excellent episodes. He said it depended too much on the show's romantic relationships, which he feels are growing stale, although he praised Rashida Jones's performance and the focus on the strong platonic relationship between Leslie and Ron.|$|E

Ware {{had been working on}} songs for his own album which he would later issue under the title Musical Massage, a collection of erotic singles Ware had composed with a variety of writers, including Jacqueline Hillard and Arthur [...] "T-Boy" [...] Ross, brother of Diana Ross. When Motown CEO Berry Gordy paid a visit to Ware, the songwriter was more than happy to play Gordy his selection of tracks.
