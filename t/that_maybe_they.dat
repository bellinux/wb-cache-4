500|$|To avoid {{confusion}} with Larter and Carter, Cook {{was required to}} dye her hair brown for the role. [...] "I like being a chameleon. It opens you up for so much more in this work. You don't get typecast," [...] Cook professed. Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly's relationship. [...] "It's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn’t want to go there, I guess. They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn’t want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, {{is a little bit}} of chemistry and you get the idea that through tragedy something good will come. So it ends in an optimistic way, <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> can be together but there’s no real love story," [...] Landes articulated.|$|E

[...] In I Am Legend, Will Smith's character is the last healthy human in New York City and lives with his dog.

500|$|However, Ryan Book of Music Times, {{was less}} {{critical}} with his review: [...] " [...] {{took a break}} from colorful music videos {{to make a statement}} of racial relations... the song uses a less clear sample than the other tracks, but interpolates his words into the electronic breakdown {{at the end of the}} song". Marc Robisch of Thought Catalog felt that [...] "Long Way to Go" [...] is [...] "one of the most interesting out of any on Love. Angel. Music. Baby.", further adding that the outro of the song resembles the work of M.I.A.. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was mixed with his review, stating that the song [...] "is a jarring buzz kill – and that's what's appealing about L.A.M.B., even if it such a shallow celebration of fleeting style and outdated bling-bling culture, it can grate". [...] A review from Traxionary described [...] "Long Way to Go" [...] as [...] "a plea for interracial love–or the tolerant embrace of it–the central contention that [...] "beauty" [...] can be [...] "black or white/yellow or green"". In an extremely positive review of the track, Mike Usinger writing for The Georgia Straight, claimed that [...] " [...] a surprisingly soulful duet with Andre 3000, Stefani has come up with the kind of solo album that gets singers thinking <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> don't need a backing band at all," [...] referencing Stefani's time spent with No Doubt.|$|E
