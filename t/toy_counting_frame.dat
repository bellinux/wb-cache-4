30|$|Charts, blocks, picture books, <b>toys</b> and <b>counting</b> <b>frames</b> (SWIT, 2011) are {{the most}} common TLM {{resources}} available to an AWW. AWWs, {{at the beginning of their}} tenure undergo training on use and further development of materials for children (SWIT 2011). They are also required to undergo refresher trainings every two years. This policy of refresher training when coupled with the large number of AWWs creates an almost unending back-log of freshers, given that the rate of re-training is never quite the same as the rate of pedagogical innovation. As a result, most AWWs continue to use outdated materials and methods with no or little access to new ideas, innovations which improve a child’s experience in pre-school. Understanding that AWWs are not only over-burdened but also have had very limited exposure to new and innovative learning materials, SWIT has put in place a rigorous capacity development model for these five thousand one hundred and twenty eight AWWs & their supervisors. The model is based on the premise; if AWWs have access to resources, which guides them, works as a sounding board for ideas, it will motivate them to use existing materials and their learning with the children in innovative ways. This, in turn, translates into joyful learning experiences for the child.|$|R

40|$|Stereology is {{the science}} that uses {{geometric}} probability {{to extract the}} internal quantitative properties of a three dimensional object based on lower dimensional information. It is a valuable research tool in biological science and relies heavily on statistical principles. In this dissertation, we focus on studies that examine the number of neurons in a brain region of interest using stereological techniques in order to compare subjects in different diagnostic groups, e. g., subjects with schizophrenia and control subjects. A large number of <b>counting</b> <b>frames</b> are usually used to obtain a prespecified precision for an individual {{in these kinds of}} studies. Typically, researchers determine the number of <b>counting</b> <b>frames</b> for each individual by controlling the coefficient of error for the individual. However, the researchers from the Conte Center for the Neuroscience of Mental Disorders (CCNMD) at University of Pittsburgh primarily focus on comparing biomarkers among different diagnosis groups rather than evaluating individuals. A design goal for such stereological studies is to keep study cost within budget and time constraints, while maintaining sufficient statistical power to address the research aims. Statistical power can be increased by either adding more subjects or more <b>counting</b> <b>frames.</b> And the cost of a study can be approximated by a linear combination of the number of subjects and number of <b>counting</b> <b>frames.</b> To address this need, we have developed new technologies that enable researchers to design a cost efficient study balancing the number of subjects with the number of <b>counting</b> <b>frames</b> for each subject. We also develop adaptive designs to conduct stereological studies. Adaptive designs allow the opportunity to look at the data at an interim stage, and to modify the design based on the information obtained from the first stage data. In our adaptive design, we estimate the stereological variance without breaking the blind of the Stage I data, and re-design the second stage based on the stereological variance estimator obtained from the first stage. Based on our procedure, we show researchers can cost-effectively modify the design while maintaining the desired study power...|$|R

In this study we aimed to evaluatecoronary blood flow with TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> in patients with left bundle branch block and angiographically proven normal coronary arteries. Materials and methods: We retrospectively studied 17 patients with left bundle branch block and as a control group 16 patients without left bundle branch block. All patientshad angiographically proven normal coronary arteries. Left bundle branch block was determined according to standart electrocardiographic criteria. The TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> was measured for each major coronary artery in each patient. Results: TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> for left anterior descending coronary artery {{was found to be}} significantly higher in patientswith left bundle branch block compared with patients without left bundle branch block (35. 4 ± 16. 7 ve 23. 8 ± 4. 5, p= 0. 012).

However, such data in syndrome X was lacking. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the prognostic value of the TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> in syndrome X patients, compared with the normal population. Methods: The TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> was measured in 2, 049 consecutive patients referred for coronary angiography from March 2003 to February 2005. Results: Among 308 patients with normal coronary angiograms, 44 undergoing the procedure for electrophysiologic studies or valvular heart disease surveys other than angina were designated normal controls. Another 155 patients with positive stress test results were diagnosed as syndrome X. Comparisons of the two groups showed that the syndrome X patients had higher <b>frame</b> <b>counts</b> in the left anterior descending artery (40. 9 ± 15. 7 vs. 47. 8 ± 25. 4; p < 0. 05) and left circumflex artery (35. 2 ± 11. 7 vs. 42. 0 ± 18. 7; p < 0. 05). A similar trend was found in the right coronary artery (29. 3 ± 13. 5 vs. 31. 9 ± 15. 9; p = 0. 2). The TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> in each artery of the syndrome X group was related to the patients' variables (sex, age, and body mass index), clinical variables (medication use, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and family history), and hemodynamic variables (aortic systolic blood pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure). By multivariate analysis, the TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>counts</b> in all arteries were significantly higher in women and lower with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use (both p < 0. 05). The <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> in the left anterior descending was associated with diuretics use (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: Our TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> data confirm the presence of slow coronary flow in syndrome X patients, especially women.

Final Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) <b>frame</b> <b>counts</b> of culprit coronary arteries may show significant variability despite successful coronary reperfusion after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this prospective observational study, relationship between final TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>counts</b> of the culprit coronary artery and admission glucose values was investigated in patients who underwent successful primary PCI due to acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Methods: During a 6 - month period of time, 73 non-diabetic patients presented with acute STEMI who have undergone primary PCI with final TIMI 3 flow were consecutively included in the study. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to final TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>counts.</b> Group 1 (n= 53) consisted of patients with final TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>counts</b> of the culprit coronary artery within the two standard deviation of predefined values and Group 2 (n= 20) consisted of those with higher TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>counts.</b> Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U tests and multiple linear regression analysis. Results: Despite similar fasting glucose values, admission glucose levels were significantly higher in Group 2 as compared to Group 1 (138 [114 - 165] vs. 123 [97 - 143] mg/dl, p= 0. 03). In whole group, admission glucose values were significantly correlated with corrected TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>counts</b> of culprit coronary arteries (r= 0. 30, p= 0. 01).

Methods: This retrospective study included 62 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (34 men, 28 women; mean age 59. 7 ± 10. 6 years) and 62 control subjects without dilated cardiomyopathy (28 men, 34 women; mean age 56. 6 ± 9. 8 years).

The TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> was determined for each major coronary artery in each patient. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test, Chi-square test and Pearson correlation analysis. Results: The TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>counts</b> for each major epicardial coronary artery were found to be significantly higher in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy compared to control subjects (corrected TIMI <b>frame</b> <b>count</b> for left anterior descending coronary artery: 37. 0 ± 12. 5 vs 28. 7 ± 11. 6, respectively, p< 0. 001; left circumflex coronary artery: 37. 7 ± 12. 1 vs 31. 0 ± 12. 5, respectively, p= 0. 003; right coronary artery: 37. 4 ± 12. 6 vs 30. 7 ± 11. 6, respectively, p= 0. 003).
