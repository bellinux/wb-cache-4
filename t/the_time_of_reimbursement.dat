40|$|AbstractObjectiveAssessment of the {{effectiveness}} compared with alternative treatment(s) {{plays an important role}} in many jurisdictions in determining the reimbursement status of pharmaceuticals. This type of assessment is often referred to as a relative effectiveness assessment (REA) and is carried out by many jurisdictions. Increased sharing of information across jurisdictions may save costs and reduce duplication. The objective of this study was to explore the main similarities and differences in the major methodological aspects of REA in multiple jurisdictions. MethodsData were gathered with a standardized data extraction form by searching publicly available information and by eliciting information from representatives at relevant organizations. ResultsOf the initially included 35 jurisdictions, data were gathered for 29 jurisdictions. There seem to be substantial similarities on the choice of the comparator, the role of indirect comparisons, and preferred end points in REAs (except for the use of health state utilities). Jurisdictions, however, differ in whether effectiveness (usual circumstances of health care practice) is estimated in case no (comparative) effectiveness data are available and how this is done. ConclusionSome important methodological aspects for REA are approached in a similar way in many jurisdictions, indicating that collaboration on assessments may be feasible. Enhanced collaboration in the development of methods and best practices for REA between jurisdictions will be a necessary first step. Important topics for developing best practice are indirect comparisons and how to handle the gap between efficacy and effectiveness data in case good quality comparative effectiveness data are not yet available at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> decisions...|$|E
40|$|This project {{carries out}} an {{analysis}} of market access of orphan drugs for rare diseases. In the European Union (EU), orphan drugs are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of rare diseases. These rare diseases are life-threatening or chronically seriously debilitating conditions affecting {{no more than five}} in 10, 000 persons in the EU. Worldwide, policies are available to stimulate the development and marketing of orphan drugs. Such policies serve to compensate industry for the risks and lower potential return on investment due to the low number of patients. Part 1 of this project, the general introduction, provides the definitions and background related to orphan drugs and rare diseases and presents an overview of the different steps of market access of orphan drugs in the EU. The contents of this project reflect these steps, i. e. orphandesignation and marketing authorization are discussed in part 2, pricing is discussed in part 3, reimbursement in part 4 and uptake in part 5. The general introduction also provides an overview of the arguments for and against attributing special status to orphan drugs. Studies on the registration of orphan drugs are reported in part 2. An evaluationof the orphan drug policies in the EU by orphan drug experts is provided in chapter 2. 1. Experts perceive the orphan drug policies in the EU asuseful. Within the context of continuing to optimize patient access to orphan drugs, several policy recommendations were formulated such as defining the concept of sufficiently profitable in the context of reducing the period of market exclusivity for highly profitable orphan drugs, determining the level of clinical evidence needed to authorize orphan drugs, etc. Chapter 2. 2 describes the development and validation of a new tool, COMPASS, to assess the quality of orphan drugs clinical evidence presented for orphan drugs at the time of marketing authorization. The tool was drawn up based on elements derived from existing checklists supplemented with items specifically related to rare diseases and orphan drugs as recommended by six experts. The COMPASS tool can for examplebe used by local reimbursement agencies for the review of clinical evidence in orphan drug registration dossiers or by clinicians and pharmacists upon considering a (new) orphan drug treatment. The COMPASS tool was used in chapter 2. 3 to quantitatively evaluate the characteristicsand quality of pivotal studies presented for orphan drugs authorised inthe EU before July 1 st, 2012. These studies were found to exhibit methodological flaws such as lack of blinding in the study design, lack of QoL-related endpoints as outcome, use of surrogate endpoints, etc. Additionally, there were important shortcomings in the reporting of those studies, which further complicates the interpretation of the clinical evidence. This study shows that a more demanding regulatory process for orphan drugs is needed. Studies on the pricing of orphan drugs are reported in part 3. The influence of orphan designation status on prices of drugs for rare indications is demonstrated in chapter 3. 1. The analysis showed that the median price per defined daily dose was higher for drugs with an orphan designation ( 138. 56) than for drugs without an orphan designation used for rare indications ( 16. 55). Chapter 3. 2 providesseveral examples of repurposed drugs for rare indications for which theeffectiveness evidence was published prior to the application for orphan designation status. Upon comparing Belgian hospital prices per defineddaily dose of selected drugs for common diseases with the price of repurposed drugs for the rare disease indication, differences of up to 200 fold were reported. This pricing practice adds to the budget impact of treating rare diseases. An overview of the international scientificliterature on the drivers of pricing of ultra-orphan drugs in describedin chapter 3. 3. Ultra-rare diseases constitute an informal subcategory,within rare diseases, to describe very rare diseases (i. e. occurring inless than one per 50, 000 individuals). The pricing process of ultra-orphan drugs is a complex and non-transparent issue. Evidence in the literature seems to indicate that ultra-orphan drugs are priced based on rarity of the indication and the number of available alternatives. Chapter 3. 4 shows how various drug- and disease-specific variables relate toannual treatment costs per patient and per orphan drug indication in six EU Member States. Additionally, it was investigated if certain country-specific pricing and reimbursement policies affect the price level of orphan drugs. Repurposed orphan drugs, orally administered orphan drugs or orphan drugs for which an alternative treatment is available are associated with lower annual treatment costs. Orphan drugs with multiple orphan indications, for chronic treatments or for which an improvement in overall survival or quality-of-life has been demonstrated, are associated with higher annual treatment costs. No association was found between annual treatments cost of orphan drugs across countries and the different pricing and reimbursement systems. Current debate about the affordabilityof high-priced orphan drugs highlights the need for more transparency in orphan drug price setting. The topic of reimbursement of orphan drugs is discussed in part 4. Because of their high price and difficulties in demonstrating effectiveness, orphan drugs are often perceived as not able to provide value for money. In chapter 4. 1 an overview of the evidence on the value for money of orphan drugs is given. Results show that orphan drugs can provide value for money. Considering a threshold of £ 30, 000 per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) (i. e. threshold for reimbursement applied in England and Wales) ten {{out of a total of}} nineteen orphan drugs for which data was available, offer value for money. Factors other than cost-effectiveness are also taken into account at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> In chapter 4. 2 qualitative research methods were applied to establish that various official (i. e. therapeutic value, budget impact, price and impact in clinical practice) and non-official (i. e. pricing and reimbursement in other countries, interference by patient organisations and experts, arguments related to quality of pharmaceutical compounding, media attention, innovative character, economic importance, ethical arguments and the political climate) factors might influence reimbursement decisions for orphan drugs in Belgium. The identification of these factors is crucial in the development of a transparent and consistent framework which will guide future decision-making for reimbursement of orphan drugs. A study on the uptake of orphan drugs is reported in part 5. Chapter 5. 1 shows that the uptake of orphan drugs varies across EU Member States. The highest volumes of orphan drugs in the first year occurred in Member States with a high gross domestic product (GDP) and implicitly, a higher budget for health care, independently of the existence of a formal health technology assessment (HTA) organisation. In contrast, in countries with a low GDP, orphan drugs were less available incountries with a formal HTA-organisation. There, budgetary restrictionscan cause the exclusion of less cost-effective orphan drugs. These variations have important implications with respect to access to orphan drugs. Recommendations for a sustainable orphan drug market are proposed in the general discussion in part 6. These recommendations relate toone (or more) of the steps of market access. Several recommendations toimprove quality of clinical evidence (for instance by setting trial standards imposing the use of at least one hard endpoint) are formulated. Furthermore, to capture what is valued by patients, patient(s) (organizations) should be able to provide input in an early stage on what endpoints should be considered when developing a new drug for a rare disease. Development of new orphan drugs can be improved by adopting a public-private partnership approach for orphan drug development. Patient registries are an important tool to gather knowledge about the natural course of a rare disease and/or the long-term effectiveness of an orphan drug. Long-term data is required for marketing authorization and to guide reimbursement decisions. Recommendations relating to pricing of orphan drugs include measures to increase transparency in orphan drug pricing, a proposalto prescribe repurposed orphan drugs by international non-proprietary name and a call to revise orphan drug status of sufficiently profitable orphan drugs. Timely access to new orphan drugs can be achieved by implementing managed entry agreements to deal with the uncertainty about cost-effectiveness and by optimizing reimbursement procedures for orphan drugs across EU Member States. Finally, there is a need to define prioritiesin funding and reimbursement of orphan drugs. Upcoming challenges for the orphan drug pharmaceutical industry are also discussed. For instance,adaptive licensing is expected to reduce the overall cost of development and to have a positive effect on timely access to new drugs. Future research could focus on pricing and budget impact orphan drugs, an issue of continued importance in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Since its {{enactment}} in 2000, the European Orphan Medicinal Products Regulation {{has allowed}} the review and approval of approaching 70 treatments for some 55 different conditions in Europe. Success does not come without a price, however. Many of these so-called “orphan drugs” have higher price points than treatments for more common diseases. This has been raising debate {{as to whether the}} treatments are worth it, which, in turn risks blocking patient access to treatment. To date, orphan drugs have only accounted for {{a small percentage of the}} overall drug budget. It would appear that, with increasing numbers of orphan drugs, governments are concerned about the future budget impact and their cost-effectiveness in comparison with other healthcare interventions. Orphan drugs are under the spotlight, something that is likely to continue as the economic crisis in Europe takes hold and governments respond with austerity measures that include cuts to healthcare expenditures. Formally and informally, governments are looking at how they are going to handle orphan drugs in the future. Collaborative proposals between EU governments to better understand the value of orphan drugs are under consideration. In recent years there has been increasing criticism of behaviours in the orphan drug field, mainly centring on two key perceptions of the system: the high prices of orphan drugs and their inability to meet standard cost-effectiveness thresholds; and the construct of the system itself, which allows companies to gain the benefits that accrue from being badged as an orphan drug. The authors hypothesise that, by examining these criticisms individually, one might be able to turn these different “behaviours” into criteria for the creation of a system to evaluate new orphan drugs coming onto the market. It has been acknowledged that standard methodologies for Health Technology Assessments (HTA) will need to be tailored to take into account the specificities of orphan drugs given that the higher price-points claimed by orphan drugs are unlikely to meet current cost-effectiveness thresholds. The authors propose the development of a new assessment system based on several evaluation criteria, which would serve as a tool for Member State governments to evaluate each new orphan drug at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> pricing and <b>reimbursement.</b> These should include rarity, disease severity, the availability of other alternatives (level of unmet medical need), the level of impact on the condition that the new treatment offers, whether the product can be used in one or more indications, the level of research undertaken by the developer, together with other factors, such as manufacturing complexity and follow-up measures required by regulatory or other authorities. This will allow governments to value an orphan drug that fulfilled all the criteria very differently from one that only met some of them. An individual country could determine the (monetary) value that it places on each of the different criteria, according to societal preferences, the national healthcare system and the resources at its disposal – each individual government deciding on the weighting attributed to each of the criteria in question, based on what each individual society values most. Such a systematic and transparent system will help frame a more structured dialogue between manufacturers and payers, with the involvement of the treating physicians and the patients; and foster a more certain environment to stimulate continued investment in the field. A new approach could also offer pricing and reimbursement decision-makers a tool to handle the different characteristics amongst new orphan drugs and to redistribute the national budgets in accordance with the outcome of a differentiated assessment. The authors believe that this could, therefore, facilitate the approach for all stakeholders. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{descriptive}} cross-sectional survey {{was to examine the}} health promotion attitudes and practices of Texas nurse practitioners and to evaluate the applicability of the Theory of Reasoned Action and the Theory of Planned Behavior as a theoretical model to guide nurse practitioner health promotion research. A questionnaire developed to elicit responses regarding demographic information, practice characteristics, behavior, behavior intention, attitudes toward health promotion, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control for health promotion practices was mailed to the home address of 727 Texas nurse practitioners. The majority of the 442 respondents reported positive attitudes toward health promotion. Texas nurse practitioners provide health promotion for more than 50 % of their patients. Significant barriers to the provision of health promotion cited by Texas nurse practitioners were lack <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> lack <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> and lack <b>of</b> patient desire to change behavior. The findings of this study support the use of the Theory of Reasoned Action and the Theory of Planned Behavior in nurse practitioner research. ...|$|R
