50|$|Friedman first {{ran for the}} Austin City Council in 1971, {{backed by}} a {{coalition}} which included University of Texas students, Mexican-Americans, African-Americans, and sundry supporters of a liberal reform agenda. The 26-year-old was elected in <b>the</b> <b>November</b> <b>balloting</b> in a close election, becoming the youngest person ever elected to the Austin City Council. Friedman's victory came largely {{as the result of}} an influx of new voters, with the legal voting age being lowered from 21 to 18 ahead of the election.|$|R
25|$|Both {{the council}} {{members and the}} mayor serve {{four-year}} terms; none face term limits. Council members are nominated by their wards via a ward-level primary held in September. The top vote-earners from each party then compete at-large for their ward's seat on <b>the</b> <b>November</b> <b>ballot.</b> In other words, on election day the whole city votes on all the council races up for that year. Council elections are severed: Wards 1, 2, and 4 (as well as the mayor) are up for election {{in the same year}} (most recently 2015), while Wards 3, 5, and 6 share another year (most recently 2013).|$|E

The group's stated rationale was to prompt public examination of the premise that marriage exists {{for the purpose of}} procreation and to create a test case in which Andersen would be reversed. The initiative's sponsors withdrew it on July 3, after failing to gather a sufficient number of signatures to qualify for <b>the</b> <b>November</b> <b>ballot.</b>|$|E

Later the same month, the Mississippi state Democratic Party requested Hawaii to verify that the long-form image on the White House website matched the copy on file and they were provided with a certified verification, bearing the state seal and signed by state registrar Alvin T. Onaka, who had certified both released birth certificates.|$|E
5000|$|The {{municipal}} {{general election}} campaign in 1925 was highlighted by an attack upon Criswell for having {{registered in the}} Socialist Party in January 1918 but afterwards changing his registration to Republican and notifying the Socialist Party [...] "that {{he was still in}} sympathy with the principles of Socialism and felt that he could do more outside of the party to forward them than as a member."

25|$|Voter {{approval}} of the convention center bond levy was critical to winning investor participation {{in the rest of}} the Garden Gateway development. But political complications once more interfered with the ballot proposal. For years, municipal and county court judges had been pressing for a new courthouse and county jail. Cleveland had agreed to put a bond levy for both structures on <b>the</b> <b>November</b> <b>ballot.</b> But with the onset of the Recession of 1958, Celebrezze believed voters would turn down both proposals. To save the convention center, he suggested postponing the courthouse levy. Judges reacted with outrage, attacking the convention center bond levy as unnecessary. Council reaction was poor as well, with a majority of Cleveland City Council members agreeing that the convention center bond issue was now dead because of the recession.|$|E
25|$|From 1983 to 1992, the 91st Assembly {{district}} included {{parts of}} Westchester, Orange, Rockland, and Putnam Counties. However, in 1992, Assembly Democrats substantially redrew the district boundaries, placing the newly renamed 90th Assembly district entirely within Westchester County. Instead of {{running in the}} newly redrawn district, Pataki decided to challenge seven-term incumbent Republican State Senator Mary B. Goodhue in the Republican primary by criticizing her for taking her grandchildren to Disney World and missing a vote in Albany. Pataki won the primary by a 52% to 48% margin. However, Goodhue was still going to appear on <b>the</b> <b>November</b> <b>ballot</b> on a minor party line. In November 1992, George Pataki won election to the New York State Senate in a 4-way race. Pataki served in the Senate of the 190th New York State Legislature, and ran for governor at the next election.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Roberts ran for {{governor}} of Oregon (the fifth woman to do so), but lost in the Democratic primary to Robert W. Straub. Later that year, {{following the death of}} Democratic nominee Wayne Morse, she was picked by the Democratic Party to run on <b>the</b> <b>November</b> <b>ballot</b> for the 1974 Oregon United States Senate, an unsuccessful bid against incumbent Bob Packwood. In 1975, she was named the Education Citizen of the Year Award by the Oregon Education Association and the Woman of the Year by the Oregon Women’s Political Caucus. The next year the Oregon Conference of Seventh Day Adventists gave her their Liberty Award. During this time Roberts also served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1968, 1972, and 1976, while also practicing law at the firm Skelton & Roberts from 1967 to 1977. She served as the Oregon chairperson for Jimmy Carter's Presidential campaign in 1976.|$|E

25|$|On April 21, 2005, {{a lawsuit}} was {{filed by the}} American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, the Tennessee Equality Project, and other plaintiffs, {{claiming}} that the amendment had not been published {{in a timely manner}} between legislative sessions as the state constitution required; specifically, that its newspaper publication had occurred only four months prior to the legislative election in November 2004 rather than the required six. This suit was dismissed at the appellate court level in March 2006 {{on the grounds that the}} legislature's intent to put the amendment before voters in November 2006 was widely reported in the media, meeting this requirement in spirit if not in letter. This decision was in turn appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court. The Tennessee Supreme Court rejected the ACLU's case in July 2006, stating that the plaintiffs did not show adequate standing to bring the lawsuit, thereby clearing the way for the amendment to appear on <b>the</b> <b>November</b> <b>ballot.</b>|$|E
25|$|On July 16, 2008, the California Supreme Court {{denied a}} {{petition}} {{calling for the}} removal of Proposition 8 from <b>the</b> <b>November</b> <b>ballot.</b> The petition asserted the proposition should not be on the ballot on the grounds it was a constitutional revision that only the Legislature or a constitutional convention could place before voters. Opponents also argued that the petitions circulated to qualify the measure for the ballot inaccurately summarized its effect. The court denied the petition without comment. As a general rule, it is improper for courts to adjudicate pre-election challenges to a measure's substantive validity. The question of whether Proposition 8 is a constitutional amendment or constitutional revision was ruled on by the California Supreme Court on May 26, 2009, and found {{that it was not a}} revision and therefore would be upheld. They also declared that the same-sex marriages performed prior to the passing of Prop 8 would remain valid.|$|E
