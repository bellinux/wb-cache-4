25|$|On {{the second}} day, the match changed. Bradford/Leeds UCCE, thanks to Adam Patel (54), James Duffy (64) and a defiant last wicket {{partnership}} of 86 between Tom Glover (42*) and Simon Crampton (42), took their score to 333, {{a deficit of}} 100. Even worse news for Surrey was a <b>tear</b> <b>to</b> Ian Salisbury's intercostal muscle which put {{him out of the}} rest of the game, and a re-aggravated hamstring injury to Martin Bicknell that stopped him bowling further in the match. Surrey then faltered with the bat, finishing the game on 132 for 6.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{injuries}} {{associated with the}} knee in cricket occur when a player is bowling. In the landing stride, bowlers are constantly twisting and putting extreme force through the knee joint, this can then result in a strain or more severely a <b>tear</b> <b>to</b> the collateral ligaments. Patellar tendinopathy is a common knee injury that occurs most commonly in bowlers due to the overuse of the tendon {{which can lead to}} the tendon fibres beginning to break down. David Lawrence, an English fast bowler is one particular example of how the landing stride when bowling can cause serious injuries to the knee. On 10 February 1992, his left patella shattered during a delivery.|$|E
25|$|In Week 2, {{the team}} {{traveled}} to St. Louis where they lost 24-22. A major defensive loss was suffered when Brian Orakpo went {{down from a}} <b>tear</b> <b>to</b> his left pectoral muscle. Despite widespread complaints from Redskins fans and players about the Rams playing dirty, {{there was nothing to}} do but move on to the home opener against Cincinnati. The game started on a bad omen when the Bengals threw a 76-yard TD pass on the opening drive. Although the Redskins responded furiously and played another close match, they lost and injuries continued to pile up as CB Josh Wilson and WR Pierre Garçon went down. They would win their next game on a late game field goal at Tampa Bay, 24-22, after the Buccaneers made a 4th quarter comeback to take the lead.

25|$|Before {{the regular}} season began, Marshall {{suffered}} a slight <b>tear</b> <b>to</b> his posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in the preseason game against the Detroit Lions. Although the injury sidelined him for a couple weeks, {{he was able to}} return and play in 15 games (1 start) during {{the regular season}}. Marshall had a total of 20 catches, 309 receiving yards, and 2 touchdowns for his rookie year. He caught a pass in each of the Broncos' final seven games of the season, totaling 18 receptions, 287 receiving yards, and 1 touchdown over that stretch. The lone touchdown came during an NBC Sunday Night Football home game against the Seattle Seahawks on December 3, 2006. In that game, Broncos quarterback Jay Cutler (who was making his NFL regular season debut as a rookie) threw a pass to Marshall {{on the right side of}} the field. Marshall broke and spun away from three tackles on his way to a career-high 71-yard touchdown. It was the second longest rookie-to-rookie pass play in Broncos history.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Walker muffed the opening kickoff and Dallas cornerback Dave Thomas {{recovered}} {{it on the}} 49ers 25. Aided by a personal foul penalty against linebacker Rickey Jackson, Dallas drove 25 yards in seven plays to score on Smith's 1-yard touchdown run. However, the 49ers stormed right back with a 10-play, 70-yard drive that ended with Young's 3-yard rushing touchdown. Then 49ers defensive back Deion Sanders ended the Cowboys next drive with an interception. San Francisco ended up punting, but Klaus Wilmsmeyer's kick pinned Dallas back at their 11. In the final quarter, Dallas finished an 89-yard, 14-play drive with Aikman's 10-yard touchdown pass to Irvin, cutting the score to 38-28, {{but they could not}} score again. Smith, who compiled 74 yards and two touchdowns, departed during that drive with an injured hamstring, which he had already injured before this game, it got enough wear and <b>tear</b> <b>to</b> the point he couldn't play anymore. The Cowboys had two more drives, both of which resulted in turnovers on downs. At one point, Dallas coach Barry Switzer, furious that Sanders was not called for pass interference, stormed onto the field and bumped an official while arguing, which resulted in a 15-yard penalty against the Cowboys, and Aikman was sacked by defensive end Tim Harris on fourth down on the next play. Although Aikman broke an NFC Championship Game record with 380 yards passing, and Irvin also broke an NFC Championship Game record with 192 receiving yards, ultimately the first-quarter turnovers were too much to overcome.|$|E
