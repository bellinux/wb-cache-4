5|$|Humans are {{corporeal}} beings and, as such, {{they are}} subject to examination and description by <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences.</b> Since mental processes are intimately related to bodily processes, the descriptions that <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences</b> furnish of human beings {{play an important role in}} the philosophy of mind. There are many scientific disciplines that study processes related to the mental. The list of such sciences includes: biology, computer science, cognitive science, cybernetics, linguistics, medicine, pharmacology, and psychology.|$|E

5|$|Astronomy {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} of <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences.</b> The early civilizations in {{recorded}} history, such as the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Nubians, Iranians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient Indigenous Peoples of The Americas performed methodical observations of the night sky. Historically, astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy and the making of calendars, but professional astronomy is now often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics.|$|E

5|$|Romanticism was {{a complex}} artistic, {{literary}} and intellectual movement that {{originated in the}} second half of the eighteenth century in western Europe, and gained strength during and after the Industrial and French Revolutions. It was partly a revolt against the political norms of the Age of Enlightenment which rationalised nature, and was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but significantly influenced historiography, philosophy and <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ancient {{cultures}} of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indian subcontinent, and China, among others, produced renowned surgeons {{and students of}} <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences</b> such as Susruta and Zhang Zhongjing, reflecting independent sophisticated systems of natural philosophy.

5|$|As a student, Kincaid showed {{exceptional}} {{aptitude for}} <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences</b> and achieved national attention for his scientific achievements. In 1897, while still an undergraduate, he accompanied David Starr Jordan to the Pribilof Islands {{as part of}} a study of seals undertaken by the American Fur Seal Commission. Back in Washington, Kincaid's interests focused more on insect life, and a report that year in the Boston Evening Transcript noted that he had discovered 41 new species of bees, including 22 of the genus Osmia. Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell, at the time one of America's leading entomologists, directed a portion of the sizable Kincaid bee collection to the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|He {{began writing}} several {{documents}} that strongly criticized the colonial government {{and wrote a}} report listing the elements that he felt were {{being used by the}} administration that were affecting the island's social and economic aspects. In January 1867, Baldorioty de Castro received a communication from Puerto Rico's Superior Instruction Juncture, notifying him that he was selected {{as a member of the}} Test Commission, where he was in charge of monitoring tests being issued in physics and <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the postwar}} period he served {{on a number of}} {{government}} bodies, including the National Bureau of Standards from 1947 to 1951, the mathematics panel of the National Research Council from 1951 to 1954, the physics panel of the National Science Foundation, and the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1964. In later life, he became more philosophical, and published The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in <b>the</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Sciences,</b> his best-known work outside technical mathematics and physics.|$|E

40|$|The {{task of the}} {{preschool}} teacher is to recognize the learning potential of children. Through her way of working and the wide choice of activities, {{the preschool}} teacher must enable the development of children in all areas. In this thesis, we focused on <b>the</b> field of <b>natural</b> <b>science</b> and researched <b>the</b> criteria according to which the three and four years old children make pairs out of <b>the</b> offered <b>natural</b> objects. We found out that children initially formed pairs when they were engaged in an activity, which was usually an everyday type of activity they were familiar with. Gradually the criteria {{for the formation of}} pairs changed {{and at the same time}} the number of objects with similar content or similar characteristics, increased. Among the pairs, there were some that were formed according to <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>science</b> criteria. We analysed these pairs and checked how frequently they occurred with the individual children. Later on we found out that children, who formed more pairs according to <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>science</b> criteria, differ from other children in their choice of activities and their interest in playing outside. In the kindergarten these children often chose <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>science</b> type of activities and they were also more successful at these activities than others. Through the conversations with parents we checked the link between the number of pairs formed according to <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>science</b> criteria by children and their interest in <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>science</b> type of activities and the possibilities of the direct contact with the nature in their home environment. We found out that the most of the pairs formed according to <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>science</b> criteria were formed by children, who get more encouragement for <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>science</b> type of activities at home. Through this type of research, which includes the home environment, we presented the approach for the recognition of learning potential of children in <b>the</b> field of <b>natural</b> <b>science.</b> This was how we found out that some of the three and four-year-olds in the group could be potentially talented in <b>the</b> field of <b>natural</b> <b>science...</b>|$|R

5|$|Weber's most {{influential}} work was on economic sociology, political sociology, and {{the sociology of}} religion. Along with Karl Marx and Émile Durkheim, he is commonly {{regarded as one of}} the founders of modern sociology. But whereas Durkheim, following Comte, worked in the positivist tradition, Weber was instrumental in developing an antipositivist, hermeneutic, tradition in the social sciences. In this regard he belongs to a similar tradition as his German colleagues Werner Sombart, Georg Simmel, and Wilhelm Dilthey, who stressed the differences between the methodologies appropriate to the social and <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{fundamental}} {{influence on}} Durkheim's {{thought was the}} sociological positivism of Auguste Comte, who effectively sought to extend and apply the scientific method found in <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences</b> to the social sciences. According to Comte, a true social science should stress for empirical facts, as well as induce general scientific laws from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted {{that the study of}} society was to be founded on an examination of facts. Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their metaphysical abstractions and philosophical speculation. At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.|$|E
5|$|Biogeography has a {{long history}} in <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences</b> {{concerning}} the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as migration and dispersal. and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography. There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of global warming.|$|E
