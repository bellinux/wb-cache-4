25|$|About April 1941 the Admiralty {{decided not}} to place orders {{exclusively}} through Thornycroft and leaving them <b>to</b> <b>sub-contract,</b> rather, the Admiralty placed orders directly with cabinet makers, carpenters, and yacht-builders {{in all parts of}} Britain. After February 1942, LCAs began being manufactured with deck armour in addition to their vertical armour. In the 42 months prior to the end of 1944 Britain was able to produce an additional 1,694 LCAs. Certain details were modified as production ran, but the basic LCA design remained unchanged for the length of the war. By the time production was in full tilt in preparation for Operation Overlord production rose to sixty LCAs a month.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Burns {{was hired}} to kill a jumper horse named Streetwise. This horse was owned by Donna Brown, the ex-wife of former U.S. Olympic rider Buddy Brown, {{who had once been}} a trainer at Paul Valliere's farm in Rhode Island. Because the animal had already {{suffered}} from colic and thus could not be insured against that disease, electrocution was ruled out as a method of murder. Donna Brown insisted that Burns break the animal's leg and make it look like an accident so that the horse would have to be put down by a vet. Burns decided <b>to</b> <b>sub-contract</b> the deed to a man named Harlow Arlie, who was willing to cripple the horse with a crowbar.|$|E

Weight had crept up beyond the 3,700 lb design limit but delays in the program were experienced when the company resorted <b>to</b> <b>sub-contracting</b> the wooden construction while the ongoing production at the Bell facilities did not allow for the XP-77 to take priority for research and development.

In 2000 American Apparel moved into its current factory in downtown Los Angeles where it continued to grow primarily as a wholesale business, selling blank T-shirts to screenprinters, uniform companies and fashion brands. After its experience as a wholesale brand, the company moved into the retail market. The company was ranked 308th in Inc.'s 2005 list of the 500 fastest growing companies in the United States, with a 440% three-year growth and revenues in 2005 of over US$211 million.|$|E

Administrators re-strengthened academic standards and, in 1998, the school began offering the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program. [...] By the beginning of the decade of the 2000s, City College was experiencing an academic resurgence.

2500|$|The {{fact that}} VSEL's bid was £71million lower than Swan Hunter's {{was the source}} of {{political}} controversy and led to a National Audit Office investigation to determine whether the competition was fair. The report, published on 29 July 1993, stated that, although VSEL did subsidise its bid, the MoD was right to award the contract to VSEL because the subsidy was much smaller than {{the difference between the two}} bids; VSEL's bid was £139.5million compared to Swan Hunter's £210.6million. The Times also suggested that the subsidy was as little as £10million. In anticipation of the report, the Financial Times described the different philosophies adopted by the two bidders; while Swan Hunter viewed the ships as entirely military, [...] "VSEL thought the design was basically a merchant ship with military hardware bolted on."

50|$|After {{completing}} their apprenticeship, workers {{joined the ranks}} of journeymen.

40|$|Does {{offshore}} sourcing {{by domestic}} producers destroy jobs? Does it lower wages? To {{a growing number}} of observers the answer to both questions appears to be affirmative. This paper examines the issue {{in the context of a}} conventional trade framework that has been amended to allow production to be disaggregated into its constituent activities. Offshore sourcing generally increases employment in an industry by creating more jobs in the remaining activities than are lost <b>to</b> <b>sub-contracting.</b> Offshore sourcing by labor-intensive importables industries raises both employment and wages. In general, offshore sourcing enables producers to strengthen their competitive positions against foreign rivals in the markets for end-products. When offshore sourcing involves simultaneous intra-product specialization in a labor-scarce importing country (like the United States) and a labor-abundant exporting country (like Mexico), employment and wages rise in both...|$|R

50|$|This was {{designed}} because Lincoln executives {{were concerned about}} the large heavy doors on the Mark VIII and wanted to improve them, especially for cities with tight parking spaces. They had the idea of a Mark VIII that had doors that disappeared beneath the car and would require no additional space outside the car's wheelbase for the doors to open in order to allow people to enter or exit. At this time it was usual for the large car manufacturers <b>to</b> <b>sub-contract</b> their concepts to other companies who specialized in making concepts reality. In this case, this Mark VIII was sent to Joalto near Detroit. Joalto still holds many US Patents for with this vehicle's chassis and body construction.|$|E
40|$|Inter-company {{relationships}} play {{a crucial}} role in strategies adopted by small and medium-sized industries. Between 1999 and 2002, the application of legislation on the 35 -hour work week took place in an environment characterised by high growth rates. However, for trades subject <b>to</b> <b>sub-contracting,</b> the beneficial effects of this conjuncture were impeded by the accentuation of pressure coming from big companies placing orders with their suppliers. Small and medium-sized independent industries involved in sub-contracting point out the recurrent lowering of prices which they have to bear, as well as considerable cost constraints generated by this situation - in particular concerning the application of the 35 -hour work week. The world expansion of markets for high-quality consumer goods has notably enabled small and medium-sized French independent industries to implement a strategy which is autonomous of the industrial groups, and which has often proven to be profitable. ...|$|R

Unable to sell the aircraft the company used the Centaur IV for joyriding and training. The last aircraft produced was the Sayers Monoplane, built for the 1922 Itford Hill gliding competition.

40|$|Some {{recent studies}} have benefited from {{advances}} in time series econometrics in order to evaluate price transmission mechanisms along the marketing chain. Due {{to the length of}} time series, structural changes may affect the evaluation of price-cost margins. In the case of the fresh salmon trade between Norway and France, the gross margin between producers and retailers has changed in level between January 1988 and December 1999. This article accurately identifies the date of a structural change using a range of recent ADF testing procedures (Gregory-Hansen tests, forward and backward recursive tests), before looking for the causes of the change through a survey. Two major factors can be identified: the product form and the marketing channel. Interestingly, both the increasing level of processing and the development of supermarket chains have resulted in a new role for the intermediaries, shifting from mere commercial intermediation <b>to</b> <b>sub-contracting</b> for the big retailers.
