60|$|Of this attitude, I repeat, I am {{now less}} likely than ever to repent. I have lived to see {{the thing that was}} {{dismissed}} as a fad discussed everywhere as a fact; {{and one of the most}} menacing facts of the age. I have lived to see people who accused me of Anti-Semitism become far more Anti-Semitic than I am or ever was. I have heard people talking with real injustice about the Jews, who once seemed to think it an injustice to talk about them at all. But, above all, I have seen with my own eyes wild mobs marching through a great city, raving not only against Jews, but against the English for identifying themselves with the Jews. I have seen the whole prestige of England brought into peril, merely by the trick of <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> nations as if they were one. I have seen an Englishman arriving in Jerusalem with somebody he had been taught to regard as his fellow countryman and political colleague, and received as if he had come arm-in-arm with a flaming dragon. So do our frosty fictions fare when they come under that burning sun.|$|E

While campaigning in 2007, Clinton did not support making the elimination of the sentencing disparity retroactive, but in 2015 she expressed support for making change retroactively as well as prospectively.|$|E

5000|$|Furthermore, {{according}} to Mansfield, {{when people talk}} about the difference between political philosophy and political science, they are actually <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> distinct kinds of political philosophy, one modern and the other ancient. The only way to understand modern political science and its ancient alternative fully, he stresses, is to enter the history of political philosophy, and to study the tradition handed down over the centuries: [...] "No one can count himself educated who does not have some acquaintance with this tradition. It informs you of the leading possibilities of human life, and by giving you a sense of what has been tried and what is now dominant, it tells you where we are now in a depth not available from any other source" [...] (7-8). Although modern political science feels no obligation to look at its roots, and might even denigrate the subject as if it could not be of any real significance, he says, [...] "our reasoning shows that the history of political philosophy is required for understanding its substance" [...] (7-8).|$|E

Returning to her castle, she finds her Magic Mirror and asks it who is the fairest. When it replies {{that there are two}} who are equally fair, the witch accuses it of taking the coward's way out by saying that she and Snow White are equally beautiful, only for it to answer that it was <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> Snow Whites. The furious Queen creates a magical ice storm and freezes the entire kingdom, just barely missing the horrified princess Snow White. Grunyon, who was also spared being frozen, leads Snow White into the forest to escape the storm. After finding their way into the Warm Valley, they accidentally wander upon a giant garden and two giants appear - Finicky and Corny - who mistake them for bugs and try to squash them. Snow White starts crying, and Grunyon scolds the giants who apologize and introduce themselves through song, along with five other giants - Thinker, Hicker, Tiny, Weeper, and Brawny. After hearing their story, they take pity on Snow White and Grunyon, and allow them to stay in their cottage.|$|E

"Instead {{of being}} {{interested}} {{primarily in the}} inter-relations of African trade and politics, as {{many of us were}} at that time, Walter Rodney focused his attention on the agricultural basis of African communities, on the productive forces within them and on the processes of social differentiation. As a result, his research raised a whole set of fresh questions concerning the nature of African social institutions on the Upper Guinea coast in the sixteenth century and {{of the impact of the}} Atlantic slave trade. In doing so, he helped to open up a new dimension. Almost immediately he stimulated much further writing and research on West Africa, and he initiated a debate, which still continues and now extends across the whole range of African history.When teaching at the Universities of Dar es Salaam and the West Indies, he launched and sustained a large number of discussion groups which swept up and embraced many who had had little or no formal education. As a writer, he reached out to contact thousands in The Groundings with my Brothers (1969) and in his influential How Europe Underdeveloped Africa (1972)." [...] — Remarks by Professor John Richard Gray, History Today, Vol. 49, Issue 9, 1980."When we think of Walter Rodney as a Revolutionary Scholar we are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> things, Radical Scholar and his revolutionary contribution to the study of History ie.

I show by comparing the fitness of individuals with that of collectives of individuals in the same environment and over the same period of time – as required to decide if one or more levels of selection is acting in a population – that the selection of collectives is a by-product of selection at the individual level; thus, <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> or more levels of selection represents merely a different perspective on one and the same process...|$|E
40|$|Epistemology has {{experienced}} {{an explosion of}} diversification over the past hundred years regarding the concept of justification.

In this paper I challenge the notion that externalism claims no support from intuitions. I further argue that internalists and externalists are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> completely distinct types of justification and show that internalists shift the focus onto the excusability of a believer for holding a belief rather than the justification of the belief itself and in fact frequently equivocate the two. I finally appeal to several arguments against the possibility of justified false beliefs to further bolster the general reliabilist position...|$|E

In the 1970 s, doctors recognized that those hyperactive children also had serious problems with “paying attention. ” Researchers in the 1980 s found that some children had severe problems in paying attention, but little or no problem with hyperactivity at all.

40|$|There {{is almost}} no current {{textbook}} of social psychology, {{in which the}} chapter of conformism would not start with {{the description of the}} Asch&# 39;s experiment with line-length and Sherif&# 39;s experiment with auto kinetic effect. Social norm is the bonding topic of the two. Sherif is supposed to have shown the shaping of social norms, whereas Asch is supposed to have demonstrated how they are maintained through the pressure on the subject to conform. Both authors are usually cited together and because they are connected with the same phenomenon, one can get the impression that they are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> dimensions of the same socio-psychological topic, discussed from similar theoretical standpoints. But detailed analysis of both experiments and comparison of the cognitive models of the authors that led to these experiments suggest that such an impression could be wrong.

A full (and official) response to the reviewers will be forthcoming. When we speak about building a "realistic " model we are really <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> dif-ferent things. One is getting the large-scale hydrographic fields, large-scale flow, and vertical exchange correct. The other is that the model includes processes and param-eter settings that try to represent {{what we know about the}} ocean as realistically as possible. The two are not identical. For example, my own work has shown that one can get the mean pycnocline depth and northern hemisphere overturning "correct " through vary-ing some combination of the Southern Ocean winds, tropical diffusion and lateral mix-S 91 ing from mesoscale eddies (Gnanadesikan 1999).
