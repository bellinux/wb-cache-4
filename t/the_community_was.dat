5|$|After {{the split}} with the Bahá'ís, some Azalis were {{very active in}} secular reform {{movements}} and the Iranian Constitutional Revolution (19051907), including Shaykh Ahmad Ruhi Kermani and Mirza Abd-al-Hosayn Kermani. However, <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>was</b> still suppressed as a heresy and the accusation of being an Azali was often enough for most to {{believe it to be}} true. Coupled with the Azali practice of taqiyya (dissimulation) determining whether or not a particular figure in Persian politics was an Azali is difficult.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} dignitaries {{who lived in}} Chadderton's manor houses, Chadderton's {{population}} during the Middle Ages comprised a small community of retainers, {{most of whom were}} occupied in farming, either growing and milling of grain and cereal or raising cattle, sheep, pigs and domestic fowl.

5|$|Encouraged by the 1782 Edict of Tolerance of Emperor Joseph II, Jews first {{permanently}} {{settled in}} Zagreb {{in the late}} eighteenth century, and founded the Jewish community in 1806. In 1809 the Jewish community had a rabbi, and by 1811 it had its own cemetery.

5|$|From {{the start}} the {{congregation}} was not unified. However, {{as there were}} only about 50 Jews in Jackson in 1868, <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>was</b> too small for two synagogues. Conflicts arose between the older German Jewish members and post-American Civil War Jewish immigrants from Poland, particularly over synagogue ritual. The synagogue followed the Orthodox nusach Ashkenaz, but some members wanted to adopt Isaac Mayer Wise's reformist Minhag America Prayer-Book.|$|E
5|$|In 1686, Seringapatam, {{the capital}} of the Kingdom of Mysore, had a {{community}} of more than 400 Catholics. <b>The</b> <b>community</b> <b>was</b> severely harassed in the following two decades, with the churches destroyed and the priest's house confiscated. The destruction was undertaken under the name of the Wodeyar king, Kanthirava Narasaraja I, by his finance minister. The priest's house was returned to the church in 1709. Relations between the Wodeyars and the Mangalorean Catholics improved until 1717, when there was an anti-Christian outburst. The resident priest was expelled and forbidden to preach. Several more anti-Christian outbursts followed. By 1736, there were better relations between the two groups.|$|E

5|$|In 1793, {{the church}} was rebuilt with a west tower, 3-bay nave and south porch, in squared and coursed lias with red brick and Hamstone dressings. The attempt at total {{rebuilding}} ended in failure to collect enough money, despite donations from William Pitt the Younger and Admiral Hood, and a church for <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>was</b> built instead {{at the foot of}} the hill (Burrowbridge) in 1838.

The service to Colgate was withdrawn and replaced by a local half-hourly route in Horsham in 1979. In September 1980, the company moved depots again to a larger site in Cranleigh.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} renewal, Eliot {{believed}} that suffering {{was needed for}} all of society before new life could begin. The original Little Gidding community was built for living on monastic lines, but <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>was</b> damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in 1646. The church, the centre of <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> <b>was</b> restored in 1714 and again in 1853. The image of religious renewal is combined {{with the image of}} the London air-raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world. This compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the Holy Spirit, Pentecost, communion with the dead, and the repetition of history. The theme is also internal to Eliot's own poems; the image of the rose garden at the end Little Gidding is the image that begins Burnt Norton and the journey is made circular. Also, the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family Reunion.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>community</b> <b>was</b> never financially {{stable and}} had {{difficulty}} profiting from its agricultural pursuits. By 1844, the Brook Farmers adopted a societal model {{based on the}} socialist concepts of Charles Fourier and began publishing The Harbinger as an unofficial journal promoting Fourierism. Following his vision, the community members began building an ambitious structure called the Phalanstery. When the uninsured building was destroyed in a fire, <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>was</b> financially devastated and never recovered. It was fully closed by 1847. Despite the experimental commune's failure, many Brook Farmers looked back on their experience positively. Critics of the commune included Charles Lane, founder of another utopian community called Fruitlands.

He later fictionalized his experience in his novel The Blithedale Romance (1852).|$|E
5|$|After the Civil War, {{the region}} around {{the site of}} Cooper began to grow and develop.

On July 29, 1870, after two years of debating, the state of Texas granted the request for the new county. Shortly afterwards, the first settlements were built in Cooper and the town was established. <b>The</b> <b>community</b> <b>was</b> named after Leroy Cooper, the chairman of the Texas House Committee on Counties and Boundaries who helped establish the new county.

By that year several new families had established themselves in River Oaks and many of them were interested in sending their children to public school. In 1995, several River Oaks parents petitioned HISD to re-establish the neighborhood program at River Oaks Elementary School which allows non-magnet students residing in the school's boundaries to attend. Some magnet parents opposed, believing that the River Oaks program would reduce racial diversity at the school. In 1996, HISD added a neighborhood program to the school for grades Kindergarten through 2nd, with grades 3 through 5 phased in over a subsequent three-year period.|$|E
