5|$|Under the Kingdom of Madagascar, the {{commoner}} class (hova) {{settled at}} {{the periphery of}} the noble districts, gradually spreading along the slopes of the lower hills during the late 19th century. This ville moyenne became increasingly populous under French colonial authority, which targeted them for redesign and development. Today, the neighborhoods in the ville moyenne are densely populated and lively, containing residences, historic sites and businesses. The neighborhood of Antaninarenina contains the historic Hôtel Colbert, numerous jewelers' shops and other luxury goods stores, and administrative offices. In addition to Antaninarenina, the principal neighborhoods of la ville moyenne are Ankadifotsy on the eastern hills and Ambatonakanga and Isoraka to the west, all of which are largely residential. Isoraka has developed lively nightlife, with houses converted <b>to</b> <b>upscale</b> restaurants and inns. Isoraka also houses the tomb of Prime Minister Rainiharo (1833–1852), whose sons and later Prime Ministers Rainivoninahitriniony and Rainilaiarivony are buried with him. Bordering these neighborhoods are the commercial areas of Besarety and Andravoahangy.|$|E
25|$|Chalupas are thick {{corn tortillas}} fried in lard then covered in {{red or green}} chili pepper sauce and topped with {{shredded}} meat and other things. According to legend, they were named after the barges that the Aztecs used to travel {{in areas such as}} Tenochtitlan (today Mexico City). Chalupas are popular in other areas of central Mexico but are considered a specialty of Puebla, where they are served from humble street carts <b>to</b> <b>upscale</b> restaurants.|$|E
25|$|In Australia's media world, {{there was}} a subtle {{cultural}} war underway between the pull of American popular culture on the one hand, with its widespread popularity and the risk according to its critics, of degrading the public taste. Critics favoured the supposedly superior traditional culture of the mother country, which appealed <b>to</b> <b>upscale</b> audiences that were representative of the nation's elite. Richard Boyer, (1891–1961), chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, fought against commercialism because he feared {{it would lead to}} American dominance. He held that the BBC model of a publicly owned and operated television would sustain Australia's British heritage.|$|E

25|$|The sales {{breakdown}} of the Macintosh have seen sales of desktop Macs stayed mostly constant while being surpassed by that of Mac notebooks whose sales rate has grown considerably; seven out of ten Macs sold were laptops in 2009, a ratio projected to rise to {{three out of four}} by 2010. The change in sales of form factors is due to the desktop iMac moving from affordable (iMac G3) <b>to</b> <b>upscale</b> (iMac G4) and subsequent releases are considered premium all-in-ones. By contrast the MSRP of the MacBook laptop lines have dropped through successive generations such that the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro constitute the lowest price of entry to a Mac, {{with the exception of the}} even more inexpensive Mac Mini (the only sub-$1000 offering from Apple, albeit without a monitor and keyboard), not surprisingly the MacBooks are the top-selling form factors of the Macintosh platform today. The use of Intel microprocessors has helped Macs more directly compete with their Windows counterparts on price and performance, and by the 2010s Apple was receiving Intel's latest CPUs first before other PC manufacturers.|$|E

Solomon was African-American, and Alice was Creole. For decades, Solomon worked as a {{conveyor}} belt mechanic at the Rapistan Conveyor Company. When Marrow was a child, his family moved <b>to</b> <b>upscale</b> Summit, New Jersey. The first time race played a major part in Marrow's life was {{at the age of}} seven, when he became aware of the racism leveled by his white friends towards black children, and that he escaped similar treatment because they thought that Marrow was white due to his lighter skin. Relaying this incident to his mother, she told him, [...] "Honey, people are stupid"; her advice and this incident taught Marrow to control the way the negativity of others affected him.|$|E
2500|$|Because of its {{indigenous}} {{tradition and}} abundance of raw materials, Oaxaca {{is a leading}} producer of handcrafts in Mexico. Handcrafted items here are noted for their variety and quality. Oaxacan handcrafts are traditionally made with wood, wool, clay and leather and are sold in many venues from local tianguis markets <b>to</b> <b>upscale</b> international stores. The best-known wood craft is the making of [...] "alebrije" [...] figures, which are usually miniature, brightly colored real or imaginary animals. These were originally created from paper and cardboard in Mexico City, but this craft was adapted to native Oaxacan woodcarving to the form it has today. Carver Manuel Jiménez of Arrazola is credited with the creating of the Oaxacan version of this craft. Other wood crafts include the making of masks, toys and utensils. Major woodcarving areas include San MartínTilcajete and Arrazola.|$|E

2500|$|Since 1967, {{the award}} {{ceremony}} has been broadcast on U.S. national television and includes {{songs from the}} nominated musicals, and occasionally has included video clips of, or presentations about, nominated plays. The American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League jointly present and administer the awards. Audience size for the telecast is generally well below that of the Academy Awards shows, but the program reaches an affluent audience, which is prized by advertisers. According to a June 2003 article in The New York Times: [...] "What the Tony broadcast does have, say CBS officials, is an all-important demographic: rich and smart. Jack Sussman, CBS's senior {{vice president in charge}} of specials, said the Tony show sold almost all its advertising slots shortly after CBS announced it would present the three hours. 'It draws upscale premium viewers who are attractive <b>to</b> <b>upscale</b> premium advertisers,' Mr. Sussman said..." [...] The viewership has declined from the early years of its broadcast history (for example, the number of viewers in 1974 was 20,026,000, in 1999 9,155,000) but has settled into between six and eight million viewers for most of the decade of the 2000s. In contrast, the 2009 Oscar telecast had 36.3 million viewers.|$|E
