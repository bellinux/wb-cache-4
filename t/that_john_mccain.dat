500|$|Krohn wrote Defining Conservatism, {{which was}} self-published in 2008, {{when he was}} 13 years old, because he felt the term {{conservatism}} was often misused. The book was in part a response to criticism <b>that</b> <b>John</b> <b>McCain,</b> the 2008 Republican presidential candidate, received regarding his conservative credentials. The book outlines four fundamental principles of conservative thought: support for the United States Constitution, opposition to abortion, less government, and more personal responsibility. Krohn went on to apply the principles to current events and define whether specifically cited actions violated those principles. The book was dedicated to Ronald Reagan, William F. Buckley, Jr. and Barry Goldwater, whom Krohn describes as his political heroes, along with South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint. Krohn paid to have the book published from his own savings. He {{described it as a}} [...] "first effort" [...] and immediately planned to write a second one, which he said would focus in part on Alexander Hamilton and James Monroe.|$|E

500|$|On February 14, Trump {{withdrew from}} the race. [...] In a press release, he cited infighting in the Reform Party as not [...] "conducive to victory," [...] {{concluding}} he could not win the election as the party's nominee and so, as pledged, would not continue his campaign. [...] He expressed concerns {{about the direction of}} the party, particularly its membership, referring to David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani as a Klansman, a Neo-Nazi, and a Communist, respectively. [...] However, he lauded party members Russ Verney, Jack Gargan, and others as [...] "wonderful people" [...] he was honored to meet. [...] Trump lamented the exit of Jesse Ventura from the party, arguing [...] "without Jesse, the Reform Party is just an extremist shell and cannot be a force or even a factor in 2000." [...] Trump declined to seek the nomination of Ventura's new Independence Party, finding it [...] "healthy" [...] but too young to win. [...] He expressly kept open the possibility of running for president in 2004. [...] Trump publicly announced his withdrawal on The Today Show in an interview with Matt Lauer. He explained that though he still could have won the Reform Party nomination, he believed he would only win 20 percent in the general election, which he did not want. [...] He claimed the party {{was on the verge of}} [...] "self-destructing" [...] and referred to it as a [...] "total mess." [...] In response, Pat Choate, who became the new Reform Party chairman after the unseating of Gargan, disputed Trump's claim about the party and said Trump's campaign was meant only [...] "to smear Pat Buchanan." [...] He declared Trump [...] "unwelcome" [...] to seek the party's 2004 presidential nomination. Choate later remarked that he believed Trump's campaign was a [...] "Republican dirty trick" [...] orchestrated by Roger Stone [...] "to disgust people and drive them away from the Reform Party." [...] Stone argued <b>that</b> <b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> [...] "running on Trump's message" [...] and surging in the polls signaled an end to the Trump campaign.|$|E

(The John McCain campaign targeted Catholics with a [...] "Catholic Voter Alert," [...] phone calls reminding voters of Bush's visit to BJU.) Bush denied that he either knew of or approved what he regarded as BJU's intolerant policies. On February 26, Bush issued a formal letter of apology to Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor of New York for failing to denounce Bob Jones University's history of anti-Catholic statements. At a news conference following the letter's release, Bush said, [...] "I make no excuses. I had an opportunity and I missed it. I regret that....I wish I had gotten up then and seized the moment to set a tone, a tone that I had set in Texas, a positive and inclusive tone."
