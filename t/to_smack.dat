25|$|Both Worcestershire Royals and Glamorgan Dragons were {{knocked out}} before the last round of the Twenty20 Cup group stage, so the match at New Road was fairly academic. It did not stop Worcestershire from {{amassing}} {{one of the highest}} scores in Twenty20 Cup history with 223 for 9 - Ben Smith only taking 45 balls <b>to</b> <b>smack</b> 105 off the Glamorgan bowlers, with twelve fours and six sixes, as he lifted his career Twenty20 average from 15 to 20.62. The partnership of 149 with Graeme Hick was enough to win the match for Worcestershire, as Glamorgan never quite got the hang of Shoaib Akhtar - who bowled two overs for 14 with a no-ball and a wide. Glamorgan ended up only losing five wickets, but 224 was always too much to ask, and they finished with a total 186 for 5.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Child {{behaviour}} problems (inclusive of disobedience) {{are common}} in young children and whilst they {{can be difficult to}} manage, parental management is important in reducing long-term, adverse outcomes (Kalb & Loeber, 2003; Wilson & White, 2006). Research has shown that parents smack their child as a consequence for disobedience (non-compliance), particularly when they are angry or frustrated and when other strategies are not successful (Brownlie & Anderson, 2006). Although smacking may encourage short-term compliance it is associated with a range of adverse outcomes such as increased behaviour problems, long-term behaviour problems and disobedience, increased aggression, anti-social behaviour, poor mental health, the risk of more serious behaviour problems, and poor parent-child relationships (Bitensky, 2006; Gershoff, 2010; Kalb & Loeber, 2003; Slade & Wissow, 2004; Vittrup & Holden, 2010). Research has shown that having supportive attitudes towards smacking as a discipline strategy predicts greater use of smacking (Ateah & Durrant, 2005). Therefore targeting attitudinal change in interventions may be an effective way to reduce support for, and the use of, <b>smacking</b> in response <b>to</b> child non-compliance. There is limited evidence into whether parenting interventions change attitudes <b>to</b> <b>smacking</b> {{and the extent to which}} brief interventions impact parental anger and affect. This research addresses this gap by using a longitudinal design to examine whether a brief positive parenting intervention can change parental attitudes <b>to</b> <b>smacking</b> and reduce parent anger and reduce parent negative affect. A randomized-controlled design was used to examine the impact of a 2 -hour Triple P Disobedience Discussion Group on child and family variables. One hundred and forty-one parents were randomly allocated to either the intervention or waitlist control condition. Participants in the intervention condition received a range of parenting strategies that could be used to manage common child behaviour problems. Data were collected pre-intervention, post-intervention, and for the intervention group at 5 month follow-up. It was hypothesized that parents in the intervention condition would report fewer child behaviour problems, lower levels of dysfunctional parenting styles, lower levels of parental anger (intensity and frequency), less supportive attitudes <b>to</b> <b>smacking,</b> lower levels of stress and more positive (less negative) affect as compared to parents in the waitlist control condition. The results showed that parents in the intervention condition reported significant improvements for child behaviour, parenting styles, parent anger and parental attitudes <b>to</b> <b>smacking.</b> No differences were found for parent stress and affect. Clinical and research implications of the findings are discussed along with recommendations for future research...|$|R
25|$|Still, {{with all}} these seeming leanings to ascetic conduct, these rabbis did not {{encourage}} individual fasting. The community in distress did indeed proclaim a public fast, {{and it was the}} duty of the loyal member to participate. For he who would not share in the distress would have no part in the consolation of the people (Ta'an. 11a). The habitual faster was called a sinner (ib.). This judgment was enforced by an appeal to the Biblical text in connection with the Nazir's (Nazarite's) expiatory sacrifice (Num. vi. 11). Rabbi Zeira would not permit his disciples to indulge in extraordinary practices of self-restraint, if they presumed thereby to reflect on the piety of others saner than they. The title applied to such an adept at saintly practices is characteristically deprecatory for his attitude of mind: his conduct is declared <b>to</b> <b>smack</b> of conceit, if not of hypocrisy (Yer. Ber. ii. 5d).|$|E
