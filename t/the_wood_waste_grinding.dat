40|$|Issue: A {{priority}} in recovering <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> from any source is to minimize additional contaminants {{in the course}} of preparing the material for processing. Handling or storing <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> on bare ground, crushed rock, or asphalt paved surfaces are common practices. However, these practices introduce dirt, grit, rock, and other contaminants into <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> material. Even <b>the</b> quality of the cleanest materials are downgraded. This degradation is more detrimental to the cleaner and higher value <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> than <b>the</b> lower value <b>wood</b> <b>waste.</b> Lower quality <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> leads to lower market value and greater contamination removal requirements for the facility and end-user. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends using clean concrete surfaces for front-end storage and material handling of <b>wood</b> <b>waste.</b> A well maintained concrete surface minimizes dirt, grit, rock, and other contaminants to downgrade the quality of the material. Consider the following issues when handling and storing <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> materials on concrete surfaces: Operational. Concrete surfaces are ideal for <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> dumping, rough sorting, bulk reduction (by means of rolling stock compaction), and storage because the smooth surface prevents unwanted dirt and rock to mix with <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> material.

40|$|Issue:. The {{business}} {{dynamics of}} <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> recovery industry requires {{flexibility in the}} design and operation of a facility to respond to the daily fluctuating issues. Such issues include <b>the</b> variety of <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> from <b>the</b> source generators, the types and level of contamination from <b>the</b> incoming <b>wood</b> <b>waste,</b> and <b>the</b> targeted end-use markets. Issues relating to the end-use markets pose the most challenge as both demand and prices tend to fluctuate significantly within each of the multiple end-use markets for <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> derived feedstocks. Applying the appropriate processing technique depends on <b>the</b> type of <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> (form, contaminants, etc.) and the targeted end-use market.

40|$|Issue: <b>The</b> <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> {{delivered}} to a processing facility typically contains a certain quantity of small chips, chunks, fines, and contaminants {{mixed in with}} larger pieces of <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> causing a number of problems. Small-sized wood and fines complicates manual sorting activities {{with a large number}} of individual pieces and hidden contaminants that are also present on <b>the</b> conveyor. <b>The</b> <b>wood</b> fines are also typically mixed with dirt and grit contaminants. The combination of fines, dirt, and grit causes excessive wear on material handling and size-reduction equipment, thus creating excessive equipment maintenance requirements. Finally, the small contaminants can be missed by manual and automated contaminant removal systems. Failure to remove these small contaminants can lead to excessive equipment maintenance requirements and degrade the quality of the end-product.

40|$|The Swedwood Company is a {{supplier}} to IKEA of wood furniture. They have grown larger concurrently with IKEA and at present they have 47 production units spread over twelve countries of which most {{are located in}} Eastern Europe. One of the factories is Zbaszynek which is located in Poland. They manufacture so called board-on-frame furniture. A board-on-frame is basically made out of particle board frames which are filled with special design paper that enfolds air. The frames are then covered with their skin; thinner particle boards, so called High Density Fibre (HDF) boards, and then edge banded with plastic stripes and painted and lacquered into desired design. This production generates not only furniture, last financial year Zbaszynek generated about 61   000 tons <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> too. It {{can be compared to}} their total production of furniture which reached 439 000 tons during the same period of time. This generation of <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> has caused a problem for Swedwood in general. A project called IKEA Goes Renewable (IGR) has started within IKEA with the aim to reduce the electric- and heat energy consumption and increase the use of renewable energy sources. But to be able to reduce the heat energy at a board-on-frame factory, such as Zbaszynek, {{there has to be an}} economic incentive to do so. But <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> is contaminated in comparison with <b>waste</b> from pure <b>wood</b> (free from adhesives, plastics etc.) so purchasers have been hard to find. And since <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> is used to generate the heat at the factories, the economic value has become relative low. Zbaszynek earn 1. 4 €/MWh for their <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> at present (energy value of 5. 1 MWh/ton), while for example recycled contaminated wood chippings (RT-chippings) are worth about 7. 3 €/MWh in Sweden (energy value of 4. 4 - 5. 1 MWh/ton). RT-chippings in Sweden are even allowed to contain more contaminations to receive that price, as long as it is not pressure creosoted. 1. 4 €/MWh can also be compared to the economic value of coal which is about 13. 7 €/MWh, and for district heating to households in Sweden was the average price about 68 €/MWh during 2007 (Energimarknadsinspektionen, 2007). Therefore, the main task of this thesis has been to investigate if there are any possible solutions to increase the economic value of <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> in Zbaszynek. There are more board-on-frame factories within Swedwood with the same problem, but Zbaszynek has been the pilot factory during this research. The first thing which should be considered in Zbaszynek is to keep the amount of waste as low as possible. The main task should be to reduce <b>the</b> amounts of <b>wood</b> waste; in <b>the</b> end it is a furniture factory and not a waste producer, which should be concerned before taking any further action. It is assumed though that this has already been thought through in Zbaszynek and further investigation of the waste has taken place. <b>The</b> <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> has been sent to the Eurofins laboratory in Sweden for an analysis and the test results were then compared to <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> of pure <b>wood.</b> <b>The</b> comparison indicates the nitrogen content being the main difference between Zbaszynek's <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> and pure <b>wood.</b> Nitrogen compounds, often referred to as NOx can cause severe damage to the environment and foremost lead to increased eutrophication (= Eutrofizacja (Polish) / Övergödning (Swedish)) when it is emitted to the air. Apart from the nitrogen contamination, other significant differences have not been found. The energy content of <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> has even revealed it would suit well as bio-fuel, on the condition that proper equipment to reduce the NOx emissions is present. It has been calculated that the energy content, of <b>the</b> generated <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> in Zbaszynek during Financial Year 2008, reached 310 GWh. Which can be compared to the electricity consumption of 78 GWh as was bought during the same time of period. Four main possibilities have been investigated in this report and they are: - Selling the waste to cement producers as alternative fuel - Make new products and use for furniture production again - Make briquettes or pellets and sell as fuel - Start up a Combined Heat and Power plant and produce electricity All these alternatives have their advantages and disadvantages but they all seem to be realistic solutions, on a few conditions...|$|R

40|$|Issue: From <b>the</b> time <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> arrives for {{processing}} until its processed materials are {{shipped to the}} end-user, processors should have complete knowledge {{and control of the}} expected quantity and quality of <b>the</b> recovered <b>wood</b> <b>waste.</b> <b>The</b> quantity of available feedstock and the size, shape, contamination level, and all other business-related issues are, for the most part, {{under the control of the}} processor. The only possible exception is during transportation of the feedstock from the generator or processor to the enduser. Only when a product is shipped to an end-user and unloaded, does the end-user actually examine the actual feedstock properties of <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> for comparison to what was expected and described in their contract with the supplier (the processor, in this case).

40|$|Issue: There {{are several}} {{areas of the}} country where the market is fairly well {{established}} for wood shavings and/or sawdust as livestock bedding. Sawdust and wood shavings typically compete with straw and newsprint bedding. In some areas, straw is becoming less available as farmers change their planting practices. In some parts of the country, shredded old newspaper bedding is increasingly used in place of straw. Although the supply cost of old newspapers is low at times, it also can be quite high at times, making the viability of this bedding feedstock somewhat conditional. Because most animal bedding sales are made directly between the producer and the user, the costs are considered wholesale rather than retail. The purpose of animal bedding is to supply an absorbent cushion for the animal. <b>The</b> use of <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> for animal bedding poses the potential concern about contaminants not fully removed from <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>waste.</b> Another concern is that certain wood species may cause severe reactions in some animals.

Fragments or chips that are larger than the allowable size ranges {{are referred to as}} overs. Fragments or chips that are smaller than the allowable size ranges are referred to as fines. <b>The</b> <b>wood</b> fiber that meets the specified size range is referred to as accepts. A manufacturing feedstock specification limits the amount of overs and fines that can accompany the accepts in a given shipment of wood fiber, usually by establishing an allowable weight percentage. Although careful adjustments to the size-reduction equipment can maximize the production of accepts from <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>waste,</b> <b>the</b> production of overs and fines is an inevitable side effect of any size-reduction process. (Some size-reduction equipment has a tendency to produce more overs and fines than others). Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends using vibrating or gyratory screens to separate overs and fines from acceptable processed wood fiber...|$|R
40|$|The general {{purposes}} of this study were to improve <b>the</b> efficiency of <b>wood</b> utilization and to create wood’s value added for plywood industry. To achieve the above purposes a strategy for Agro forestry Industry should be develop based on eco-efficiencyprinciples. The details of targets were: (1). to analyze critical factors in plywood industry management regarding to eco-efficiency implementation, (2) to analyze production technology that is used in plywood industry, and (3). to design a developing strategy of integrated plywood industry based on eco-efficiency principles. The result of this study show that the key factors for plywood management’s policy was environmental awareness; material utilization; and international issues. The production technology of all plywood industry in Indonesia is relatively similar. They are using the machineries of the 80 ’s and have the similar working procedures. <b>The</b> kinds of <b>wood</b> <b>wastes</b> generated from plywood industry were classified into log end, reject log end, green veneer <b>waste,</b> and others. <b>The</b> <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> was calculated 49. 52 % released from 100 % input log in plywood industry. There are three strategy of integrated plywood industry based on eco-efficiency, namely (1) selecting and managing of environmental impact, showing three kinds of waste which affect the environment (2) Improvement the plywood manufacturing technology, showing the newinnovation technology or process control management and (3) Development of new product from <b>wood</b> <b>waste.</b> <b>Wood</b> <b>waste</b> can be used to produce block board, laminated board, handicraft, and others...|$|R
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the {{combustion}} processes of <b>wood</b> <b>waste.</b> Two kinds of waste have been studied: furniture <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> (treated and used wood) and solid wood from factories (untreated wood). A kinetic study has been carried out for each material in air and an N 2 :O 2 9 : 1 atmosphere with dynamic and dynamic + isothermal runs at different heating rates, considering the decomposition of the three main components of <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> and also <b>the</b> combustion of the char obtained. Satisfactory kinetic models were obtained for each kind of wood. Significant differences in thermal behavior were found between furniture <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> and solid <b>wood,</b> probably due to the presence of additives and inorganic compounds in <b>the</b> furniture <b>wood</b> <b>waste,</b> which modifies <b>the</b> kinetic parameters of the thermal process. Moreover, combustion runs at 850 °C of both kinds of woods were also carried out in a laboratory scale tubular reactor in order to analyze the volatile and semivolatile compounds. The main differences were found in the higher yield of nitrogenated compounds found during the combustion of <b>the</b> furniture <b>wood</b> <b>waste.</b> Support for this work was provided by the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competividad, Research Project CTQ 2013 - 41006 -R (Spain), and PROMETEOII/ 2014 / 007 from Conselleria d’Educació, Cultura i Esport (Generalitat Valenciana, Spain) ...|$|R

Quarter sawing produces smaller boards than flat sawing, but has a straighter grain, which in addition to being visually pleasing, makes the lumber more stable.|$|R
40|$|The {{expansion}} of human {{activities on the}} quest for development causes an increase in generation of waste which can be reused, in most cases, as inputs to other economic activities, making them more sustainable. In this sense, the research aimed to analyze the environmental and economical conditions that favor the production of electricity from <b>the</b> use of <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> generated in <b>the</b> municipality of Marcelândia-MT. For that, the existing waste stocks in this county were quantified from data provided by the Ministry of Environment. Then, by the statistical method, the time of extraction of the total area covered by vegetation in the city was estimated.

For mulch products, the critical characteristics may include: • acceptable size distribution • allowable contamination levels Failure to satisfy quality expectations for these characteristics can lead to lost business. Best Practice: This best practice recommends that suppliers (processors) of <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> derived mulches and potential customers come to {{a clear understanding of}} quality requirements. Written product specifications should be developed and made available to purchasers of mulches to enable them to use the products properly and effectively.
