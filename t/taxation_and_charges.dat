In one example, the top-up tuition fees introduced in England are counted as additional English public expenditure (as the extra income is spent by the universities) and, therefore, an equivalent amount from the Consolidated Fund, paid for by UK-wide taxation, has been transferred to the Scottish Government. It was argued that this meant that only the English paid tuition fees, yet this money is shared with Scottish universities, despite Scottish students studying at those universities not having to contribute any extra fees.|$|E

Contrary to the assumed policy goals, this research shovrs that during 2 years of its implementation in Pemalang the local original income (PAD) has virtually decreased. Although the nominal budget of the local government has increased, the PAD has contributed less. In effect, the policy has resulted in the decline of local government income from local <b>taxation</b> <b>and</b> <b>charges,</b> the overall fiscal effort and the degree of fiscal decentralization. It is recommended that the current policy problem should be addressed by determining the target of local taxes and charges with the real local potentials. The local government has to focus on the effective and efficient taxes that are linked to the local development budgets and the local gross domestic product...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{sustainable}} transport within the European Union (EU), arguing {{that a strong}} {{sustainable transport}} definition needs to be used if targets set at Kyoto are to be achieved. The EU strategy is now (2006) based on modal shift, decoupling and technological innovation, weakening the more radical strategy set up in 2001. It seems that expansion of the EU, lower levels of growth, and the possibilities of continuing high costs of oil have resulted in changing priorities, but above all travel demand has continued to grow. The Kyoto targets are becoming much harder to reach. The paper then outlines the three groups of measures that have been promoted, looking at (1) technology and pricing, (2) regulation, <b>taxation</b> <b>and</b> congestion <b>charging,</b> <b>and</b> (3) land use, development and planning, arguing that strong action is required on all three sets of options. Even then, there is an additional requirement, namely the need to gain public acceptability through information, marketing and engagement so that positive outcomes can be matched up with policy intentions. Real progress towards reducing carbon emissions is possible provided that mutually supporting measures are taken, with political commitment to real change and public support for that change...|$|R

Little {{is known about the}} partial effect of a shift in parties' seat shares for given voter preferences, particularly in proportional representation systems. We estimate party effects using a regression discontinuity design tailored to proportional systems. Based on rich local government data, the analyses show that parties matter for fiscal policies. A larger left-wing party leads to more property <b>taxation</b> <b>and</b> higher user <b>charges.</b> It also leads to higher spending on child care but less on old-age care. These effects are caused both by changes in the representation of individual parties and by shifts between the party blocs...|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} {{characteristic of}} Belgian national politics is the highly federal nature of decision making. Important decisions require both a national majority (2/3 for constitutional changes), {{as well as}} majorities in the two main language groups. On top of that, both these communities can activate 'alarm bell'-procedures, delaying changes. In addition, there are no national parties to speak of. As a result of this, Belgian decision making can be slow and expensive. On top, it tends to significantly favour the more conservative parties. Given the historically very high public expenditure, and the very strict central control over taxation, even for revenues going to regions and communities, the tendency of Belgian governments to lower <b>taxation</b> <b>and</b> especially labour <b>charges</b> has been limited, at least if compared to radical-liberal approaches followed by certain other countries.|$|R
50|$|Taxes in Indiana {{are almost}} entirely {{authorized}} {{at the state}} level, although the revenue is used to fund both local and state level government. The state of Indiana's income comes from four primary tax areas. Most state level income is from a sales tax of 7% and a flat state income tax of 3.3% with another cut coming in 2017 that will bring the rate down to 3.23%. The state also collects an additional income tax for some counties. Local governments are funded by a property tax that {{is the sum of}} rates set by local boards, but the total rate must be approved by the Indiana General Assembly before it can be imposed. Residential property tax rates are capped at maximum of 1% of property value. Excise tax is the fourth form of <b>taxation</b> <b>and</b> is <b>charged</b> on motor vehicles, alcohol, tobacco, gasoline, and certain other forms of movable property; most of the proceeds are used to fund state and local roads and health programs. The Indiana Department of Revenue collects all taxes and pays them out to the appropriate agencies and municipalities. The Indiana Tax Court deals with all tax disputes issues, but decisions can be appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court.|$|R

The tax collectors had access without payment of fee to the registers. The registration of births was discontinued when the Taxation Acts expired. An attempt to introduce the registration of births was made in 1753, but unsuccessfully. The public had the old superstitious dread of anything like a census. Moreover, the custom was denounced as [...] "French," [...] and therefore abominable.

40|$|Macroeconomic policy uses {{a variety}} of instruments. In {{contemporary}} literature attempts to assess those instruments {{as well as to}} evaluate their pro-market levels can be found. It is claimed that the higher its pro-market level, the better the instrument. The authors focus on the description of the main instruments of macroeconomic policy and also present additional factors determining the value of the instrument with regards to its pro-market level. The conclusion is that instruments of economic policy cannot be categorised into ordered division of those instruments into such ones as <b>taxation,</b> <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> other tender instruments. Instruments which belong to the same group reveal a different level of compatibility depending on their purpose and manner in which they are used. This, in consequence, means a differentiated level of market feedback generated by those instruments.

40|$|Abstract The present {{pattern of}} <b>taxation,</b> <b>charging,</b> <b>and</b> {{providing}} support has accumulated {{over time in}} a haphazard way without the kind of strategic thinking that a long-term economic plan requires. This note sets out the sound economic and public finance principles that could guide the reform of energy taxes and supports primarily in the electricity sector. It argues for ending the RO and Feed-in Tariff schemes and replacing them by demonstrably successful CfD auctions which have dramatically lowered the cost of financing renewables. It argues for a state development bank to leverage cheap finance for low-carbon investments, reforming {{the form of the}} contracts, replacing the current alphabet soup of charges by the strandard rate of VAT on all energy and instead funding climate change policies from general taxation, thus exempting the productive sector from distortive <b>charges,</b> <b>and</b> allowing the Carbon Price Support to resume its trajectory, restoring fiscal sanity and balance.
