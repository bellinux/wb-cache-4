40|$|A novel {{process has}} been {{developed}} for separation of the cellulose, i. e. cotton and viscose, from blended-fibers waste textiles. An environmentally friendly cellulose solvent, N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) {{was used in this}} process for separation and pretreatment of the cellulose. This solvent was mixed with blended-fibers textiles at 120 degrees C and atmospheric pressure to dissolve the cellulose and separate it from the undissolved non-cellulosic fibers. Water was then added to the solution in order to precipitate the cellulose, while both water and NMMO were reused after separation by evaporation. The cellulose was then either hydrolyzed by cellulase enzymes followed by fermentation to ethanol, or digested directly to produce biogas. The process was verified by testing 50 / 50 polyester/cotton and 40 / 60 polyester/viscose-blended textiles. The polyesters were purified as fibers after the NMMO treatments, and up to 95 % of the cellulose fibers were regenerated and collected on a filter. A 2 -day enzymatic hydrolysis and 1 -day fermentation of the regenerated cotton and viscose resulted in 48 and 50 g ethanol/g regenerated cellulose, which were 85 % and 89 % of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>yields,</b> respectively. This process also resulted in a significant increase of the biogas production rate. While untreated cotton and viscose fibers were converted to methane by respectively, 0. 02 % and 1. 91 % of their <b>theoretical</b> <b>yields</b> in 3 days of digestion, the identical NMMO-treated fibers resulted into about 30 % of yield at the same period of time...|$|R
40|$|The {{low cost}} {{of natural gas}} has driven {{significant}} interest in using C 1 carbon sources (e. g. methane, methanol, CO, syngas) as feedstocks for producing liquid transportation fuels and commodity chemicals. Given the large contribution of sugar and lignocellulosic feedstocks to biorefinery operating costs, natural gas and other C 1 sources may provide an economic advantage. To assess the relative costs of these feedstocks, we performed flux balance analysis on genome-scale metabolic models to calculate the maximum <b>theoretical</b> <b>yields</b> of chemical products from methane, methanol, acetate, and glucose. Yield calculations were performed for every metabolite (as a proxy for desired products) in the genome-scale metabolic models of three organisms: Escherichia coli (bacterium), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (cyanobacterium). The calculated <b>theoretical</b> <b>yields</b> and current feedstock prices provided inputs to create comparative feedstock cost surfaces. Our analysis shows that, at current market prices, methane feedstock costs are consistently lower than glucose when used as a carbon and energy source for microbial chemical production. Conversely, methanol is costlier than glucose under almost all price scenarios. Acetate feedstock costs could be less than glucose given efficient acetate production from low-cost syngas using nascent biological gas to liquids (BIO-GTL) technologies. Our analysis suggests that research should focus on overcoming the technical challenges of methane assimilation and/or yield of acetate via BIO-GTL {{to take advantage of}} low-cost natural gas rather than using methanol as a feedstock...|$|R

The mass of glucose and xylose available {{in the form of}} polymers in the WIS were corrected with factors 1.111 and 1.136, respectively, to account for the addition of water to the monomeric units during hydrolysis.
