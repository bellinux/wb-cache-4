25|$|Ivo Josipović gave a short speech {{after the}} exit polls were {{announced}} saying he was confident the official results would match the results they predicted. After the official results were published, he gave a victory speech shortly after midnight thanking his colleagues and especially his voters for their support and expressed conviction {{he would be the}} victor once again two weeks later. He said the citizens of Croatia have a choice between the light and the dark, with him being the light, referring to his untarnished political record, and Bandić being the dark, referring to his allegations of corruption. Milan Bandić arrived to his campaign headquarters {{just a couple of minutes}} before midnight and just a couple of minutes after the results were announced he gave his speech. He congratulated all the other candidates and said a new race began that night. He said he would be an independent president, not a remote-control of Zoran Milanović and accused Josipović of being a project of the highest-ranking members of SDP. He claimed Croatia needs a president that works for them, not for his party. While he was speaking, most television networks were showing scenes from Josipović headquarters in the corner, with Milanović observing Bandić's remarks. During the middle of his speech, right when Bandić was bashing his former party and its leader, Josipović came to the stage and all television stations switched <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had to say.|$|E
500|$|Coward's {{distinctive}} clipped diction {{arose from}} his childhood: {{his mother was}} deaf and Coward developed his staccato style of speaking {{to make it easier}} for her <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was saying; it also helped him eradicate a slight lisp. His nickname, [...] "The Master", [...] "started as a joke and became true", according to Coward. It was used of him from the 1920s onwards. Coward himself made light of it: when asked by a journalist why he was known as [...] "The Master", he replied, [...] "Oh, you know – Jack of all trades, master of none." [...] He could, however, joke about his own immodesty: [...] "My sense of my importance to the world is relatively small. On the other hand, my sense of my own importance to myself is tremendous." [...] When a Time interviewer apologised, [...] "I hope you haven't been bored having to go through all these interviews for your [...] birthday, having to answer the same old questions about yourself", Coward rejoined, [...] "Not at all. I'm fascinated by the subject." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thoreau neither {{rejected}} civilization nor fully embraced wilderness. Instead {{he sought}} a middle ground, the pastoral realm that integrates nature and culture. His philosophy required {{that he be}} a didactic arbitrator between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of humanity in North America. He decried the latter endlessly but felt that a teacher needs {{to be close to}} those who needed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted to tell them. The wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest, and he preferred [...] "partially cultivated country." [...] His idea of being [...] "far in the recesses of the wilderness" [...] of Maine was to [...] "travel the logger's path and the Indian trail", but he also hiked on pristine land. In the essay [...] "Henry David Thoreau, Philosopher" [...] Roderick Nash wrote, [...] "Thoreau left Concord in 1846 for the first of three trips to northern Maine. His expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine, primeval America. But contact with real wilderness in Maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in Concord. Instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds, Thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{salmonella}} {{attack was}} noted {{as the first}} confirmed instance of chemical or biological terrorism to {{have occurred in the}} United States. Rajneesh stated that because he was in silence and isolation, meeting only with Sheela, he was unaware of the crimes committed by the Rajneeshpuram leadership until Sheela and her [...] "gang" [...] left and sannyasins came forward to inform him. A number of commentators have stated that they believe that Sheela was being used as a convenient scapegoat. Others have pointed to the fact that although Sheela had bugged Rajneesh's living quarters and made her tapes available to the US authorities as part of her own plea bargain, no evidence has ever come to light that Rajneesh had any part in her crimes. Nevertheless, Gordon (1987) reports that Charles Turner, David Frohnmayer and other law enforcement officials, who had surveyed affidavits never released publicly and who listened to hundreds of hours of tape recordings, insinuated to him that Rajneesh [...] as guilty of more crimes than those for which he was eventually prosecuted. Frohnmayer asserted that Rajneesh's philosophy was not [...] "disapproving of poisoning" [...] and that he felt he and Sheela had been [...] "genuinely evil". Nonetheless, US Attorney Turner and Attorney General Frohnmeyer acknowledged that [...] "they had little evidence of (Rajneesh) being involved in any of the criminal activities that unfolded at the ranch". According to court testimony by Ma Ava (Ava Avalos), a prominent disciple, Sheela played associates a tape recording of a meeting she had had with Rajneesh about the [...] "need to kill people" [...] in order to strengthen wavering sannyasins resolve in participating in her murderous plots: [...] "She came back to the meeting and [...] began to play the tape. It was a little hard <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was saying. [...] And the gist of Bhagwan's response, yes, {{it was going to be}} necessary to kill people to stay in Oregon. And that actually killing people wasn't such a bad thing. And actually Hitler was a great man, although he could not say that publicly because nobody would understand that. Hitler had great vision." [...] Sheela initiated attempts to murder Rajneesh's caretaker and girlfriend, Ma Yoga Vivek, and his personal physician, Swami Devaraj (Dr. George Meredith), because she thought that they were a threat to Rajneesh. She had secretly recorded a conversation between Devaraj and Rajneesh [...] "in which the doctor agreed to obtain drugs the guru wanted to ensure a peaceful death if he decided to take his own life".|$|E

5000|$|Laurence Olivier was {{originally}} offered {{the role of}} the agent but was unable to do it so Burgess Meredith was cast instead. Meredith got the role after walking into 21 one night when Joe E. Levine was there - Levine cast him on the spot. Meredith modelled his performance on the agent Swifty Lazar, even shaving his head to look like Lazar. [...] "I tried to get his cool, understated manner, his sharp clothes and, most of all, his way of speaking softly so that you've got to lean over <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> saying," [...] said Meredith.|$|R

But his tickets haven't been pulled. We're waiting <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> back." [...] Baron Cohen eventually appeared at the awards' red carpet with a pair of uniformed female bodyguards (resembling Gaddafi's Amazonian Guard) and wielding an urn purportedly containing the ashes of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il, which the actor spilled onto E! host Ryan Seacrest. The ashes were later reported to be pancake mix.|$|R

The midshipman, determined to see as well as <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> was going on, lifted up the flap a few inches behind, and, as he lay on the ground, peered in. A French officer had just entered, and he was followed by a Canadian, whom the midshipman recognized at once, as being the one who piloted the Sutherland up and down the river.|$|R
