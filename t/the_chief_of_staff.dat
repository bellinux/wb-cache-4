5|$|Groves and Parsons {{drafted a}} {{proposed}} organization and charter for the AFSWP, which they sent to Eisenhower and Nimitz for approval in July 1947. Groves {{did not get}} everything that he asked for; he wanted a status {{equal to that of}} a deputy to <b>the</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> and Chief of Naval Operations, but the most that Eisenhower and Nimitz would allow was a status equal to that of the heads of a technical service, although Groves still reported directly to them. They also characterized his role as a staff post rather than a command, although Groves was already exercising the functions of a commander at Sandia. After the National Security Act of 1947 created an independent Air Force, Groves reported to <b>the</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> of the Air Force as well, and was given a second deputy chief from the Air Force, Major General Roscoe C. Wilson, who had worked on the Silverplate project during the war.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> Committee was tilted in October 1943 when Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, Brooke's {{predecessor}} as chairman, {{retired as}} a result of poor health and Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham succeeded Pound as First Sea Lord and naval representative on <b>the</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> Committee. Brooke as a consequence got a firm ally in his arguments with Churchill. This was reflected in the most serious clash between the Prime Minister and <b>the</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff,</b> regarding <b>the</b> British preparations for final stages of the Pacific War. Brooke and <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> wanted to build up the forces in Australia while Churchill preferred to use India as a base for the British effort. It was an issue over which <b>the</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> were prepared to resign, but in the end a compromise was reached.|$|R

5|$|In early January 1915, {{it became}} known that British ships were {{conducting}} reconnaissance in the Dogger Bank area.

5|$|Boisbaudran {{named his}} element samaria after the mineral samarskite, {{which in turn}} honored Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets (1803–1870). Samarsky-Bykhovets, as <b>the</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> of the Russian Corps of Mining Engineers, had granted access for two German mineralogists, the {{brothers}} Gustav Rose and Heinrich Rose, to study the mineral samples from the Urals. In this sense samarium was the first chemical element to be named after a person. Later the name samaria used by Boisbaudran was transformed into samarium, to conform with other element names, and samaria nowadays is sometimes {{used to refer to}} samarium oxide, by analogy with yttria, zirconia, alumina, ceria, holmia, etc. The symbol Sm was suggested for samarium; however an alternative Sa was frequently used instead until the 1920s.|$|E
