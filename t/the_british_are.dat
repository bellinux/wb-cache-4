5|$|Cord and Chi {{infiltrate}} Nagarov's base {{to destroy}} the Super Computer. On {{the roof of a}} large tower, Cord destroys a building with a surface-to-air missile launcher to create a diversion. When he meets with Chi again, she is being threatened by Kostov, who thinks she has betrayed his men. Chi kills Kostov before he can pull the trigger. With Chi's help, Cord uses an elevator to go {{to the top of the}} tower and he activates a cable car leading to an island. Cord explores the docking area, and he finds Alexandria in a cell on the security level. Cord uses the main elevator in the complex to access the other levels. Cord creates a diversion and enters level 1, where he inserts the explosive charge into the Super Computer. A cut scene is shown that reveals that Alpha has betrayed him. In a transmission, she tells that premier Nagarov had to be certain that Cord was not acting on her orders when he attacked the refinery. She assured Nagarov that Cord had not entered the facility, but Nagarov had a recording of Cord in the refinery. It resulted in a simple policy shift and <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>are</b> now working with the Volgians. As the reactor becomes critical, Nagarov and Lukyan leave the room. Until this moment, the game has taken place in Cord's memory, as he was interrogated by Nagarov after being captured, but from this point on it takes place in real time.|$|E

Although the U.S. had developed pulsed radar independently of <b>the</b> <b>British,</b> there <b>were</b> serious weaknesses in America's efforts, especially the lack of integration of radar into a unified air defense system. Here, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>were</b> without peer.|$|R

No specific population figures exist, as claimants of Pashtun descent are {{spread throughout the}} country. Notably, the Rohillas, after their defeat by <b>the</b> <b>British,</b> <b>are</b> known to have settled in parts of North India and intermarried with local ethnic groups.

25|$|In 1862 {{the oldest}} polo club still in existence, Calcutta Polo Club, was {{established}} by two British soldiers, Sherer and Captain Robert Stewart. Later they spread the game to their peers in England. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>are</b> credited with spreading polo worldwide in the late 19th century and the early 20th century. Military officers imported the game to Britain in the 1860s. The establishment of polo clubs throughout England and western Europe followed after the formal codification of rules. The 10th Hussars at Aldershot, Hants, introduced polo to England in 1834. The game's governing body in the United Kingdom is the Hurlingham Polo Association, which drew up {{the first set of}} formal British rules in 1874, many of which are still in existence.|$|E
25|$|After Lim succeeded as Chief Minister, his top {{priority}} was to achieve full self-governance for Singapore from the British Government. The British {{had taken to}} account Singapore's future early during Marshall's tenure as Chief Minister. The British had agreed to Malaya's (Malaysia's predecessor) independence, and due to the strategic value of Singapore's geography, the British wanted to continue taking control over foreign and defence affairs of Singapore. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>are</b> inclined to granting Singapore self-governance instead of independence. Though Sir Robert Black, the then-Governor had taken a more open and friendly approach to self-governance for Singapore, as compared to his predecessor Sir John Nicoll, he believed in gradual self-governance. If the handover of power were {{to be carried out}} too hastily, self-governing political leaders might not have sufficient experience in governing.|$|E

25|$|Accounts {{of early}} {{encounters}} between Sydney's Aboriginal people and <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>are</b> {{provided by the}} author Watkin Tench, who was an officer on the First Fleet and the writer {{of one of the}} first works of literature about New South Wales. The colony struggled in its early days for economic self-sufficiency, since supplies from Britain were few and inadequate. The whaling industry provided some early revenue, but it was the development of the wool industry by John MacArthur and his wife Elizabeth Macarthur and other enterprising settlers that created the colony's first major export industry. For {{the first half of the}} 19th century New South Wales was essentially a sheep run, supported by the port of Sydney and a few subsidiary towns such as Newcastle (where a permanent settlement was established in 1804) and Bathurst (1815). Newcastle, north of Sydney, named after the English coal port city, was initially established as a severe punishment camp for troublesome convicts following the Castle Hill Rebellion but would grow to be a major industrial centre and the State's second largest city. The State's third city, Wollongong, south of Sydney, was founded in 1829 as an outpost for a contingent of soldiers sent in response to conflict between local Aborigines and the unruly timber-getters who had established themselves in the area. Agriculture soon established itself, dairy and coal mining had begun by the 1840s, and the city grew to become a major industrial centre. The Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars (1795–1816) were fought between Kingdom of Great Britain and the Indigenous clans of the Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers.|$|E
25|$|La Réunion capitulates {{almost without}} loss after a landing by Army troops joined by sepoys under the British East India Company, {{all under the}} active and decisive Lieutenant Colonel Harry Keating, with ships of the convoy {{on both sides of}} the island. Their path is eased by Maturin's {{propaganda}} and political meetings to explain why the locals should be happy to accept the British, with Farquhar as interim Governor. Mauritius proves more challenging. Maturin has an accident boarding HMS Néréide, which is part of the force sent to Île de la Passe. He is seriously injured, so he observes Clonfert during this recuperation aboard. The action is successful. Maturin is put down on Mauritius to continue his work. A small group of ships, under the command of Captain Pym, puts soldiers on Mauritius to staff the fort. The French appear with three ships Bellone, Minerve, Victor and two Indiamen Ceylon and Windham. They boldly attack the fort and then sail into the port; <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>are</b> caught unprepared but decide to attack. The struggle goes on for days with heavy casualties and in the end two British ships run aground. Sirius and Magicienne are burnt to prevent their capture, and Iphigenia and the fort at Île de la Passe are abandoned to be retaken by the French. Néréide is taken and Clonfert is severely wounded in the neck and head by a splinter. A messenger vessel, with Maturin aboard, reaches La Réunion to inform Aubrey of the losses and the failed attack on Port Southeast.|$|E

[...] Anna is shocked by the accusations – the King is a polygamist, but he is no barbarian – but she is reluctant to see him after their argument. [...] Lady Thiang convinces her that the King is deserving of support ("Something Wonderful"). [...] Anna goes to him and finds him anxious for reconciliation. [...] The King tells her that <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>are</b> sending an envoy to Bangkok to evaluate the situation. [...] Anna [...] "guesses" [...] – the only guise in which the King will accept advice – that the King will receive the envoy in European style, and that the wives will be dressed in Western fashion.

In June 2013, Chris Bushell of Selex ES warned that the failure of European nations to invest in an AESA radar was putting export orders at risk. In November BAE responded that work on an AESA radar continued, to protect exports.

[...] RAF Tranche 1 Typhoons are too structurally and technically different from later models, so the British have decided that beginning in 2015 or 2016, the older models will be switched out for Tranche 2 and 3 versions, a process which will remove the Tranche 1 aircraft from service around 2020 to be stripped for parts to support newer versions to lower costs.|$|E
