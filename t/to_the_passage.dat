The fact that the registration law didn't pass until 1997, after the illicit sexual relationship ended, would not have exempted him from registration.

5|$|Widespread {{rainfall}} occurred throughout Central America {{in early}} October 2008 due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of a tropical wave through the region. Later, another tropical wave approached the region, which {{was believed to}} have left {{the west coast of}} Africa on September17. The wave developed a low pressure area on October10 in the southwestern Caribbean, with sporadic convection. On October13, the system consisted of a large area of convection drifting northward offshore eastern Central America, and Dvorak classifications began, indicating gradual organization. At that time, there was another low pressure area on the Pacific coast, and both systems were producing rainfall across Central America.|$|E
5|$|Alaska possessed no {{mental health}} {{treatment}} facilities prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of the 1956 Act. At {{the time of the}} Act's passage, Alaska was not a U.S. state, being constituted instead as a territory of the United States. The treatment of the mentally ill was governed by an agreement with the state of Oregon dating back to the turn of the 20th century. On June 6, 1900, the United States Congress enacted a law permitting the government of the then District of Alaska to provide mental health care for Alaskans. In 1904, a contract was signed with Morningside Hospital, privately owned and operated by Henry Waldo Coe in Portland, Oregon, under which Alaskan mental patients would be sent to the hospital for treatment. A commitment regime was established under which a person said to be mentally ill was to be brought before a jury of six people, who would rule him sane or insane. The patient was routinely sent to prison until his release or transfer to Portland; at no point in this ruling was a medical or psychiatric examination required.|$|E

5|$|As a judge, Parker was {{notable for}} {{independently}} researching each {{case that he}} heard. He was {{generally considered to be}} pro-labor and was an active supporter of social reform legislation, for example upholding a maximum-hours law as constitutional. In the 1902 decision Roberson v. Rochester Folding Box Co, Parker found against a woman whose face had been used in advertisements without her permission, ruling that this use did not violate her common law privacy rights. The decision was unpopular in the press and led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of a privacy law by the New York State Legislature the following year. In the same year, Parker upheld the death sentence given to convicted murderer Martha Place, who became the first woman to be executed by electric chair.|$|E
5|$|Blackwell {{also served}} on the Democratic National Committee and as {{co-chairman}} of the Mississippi Democratic Party. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party sent Blackwell and three other delegates to the 1964 Democratic National Convention in New Jersey.

In late 1982 Blackwell went to the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and received a Master's Degree in Regional Planning. Although Blackwell did not attend high school, the National Rural Fellows Program helped her gain admittance to the University of Massachusetts by awarding her a scholarship and providing her credit based on activism and life experience.|$|E
5|$|Different {{climatic factors}} {{influence}} {{the climate of}} Buenos Aires. The semi–permanent South Atlantic High influences its climate throughout the year by bringing in moist winds from the northeast, which bring most of the precipitation to {{the city in the}} form of frontal systems during winter or storms produced by cyclogenesis in autumn and winter. The hot temperatures and high insolation in the summer months form a low pressure system called the Chaco Low over northern Argentina, generating a pressure gradient that brings moist easterly winds to the city – because of this, summer is the rainiest season. In contrast, this low pressure system weakens in the winter, which combined with strong southerly winds results in a drier season due to weaker easterly winds. Being located in the Pampas, Buenos Aires has variable weather due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of contrasting air mass – the cold, dry Pampero from the south and warm, humid tropical air from the north. The coastal location results in a strong maritime influence, causing extreme temperatures (hot or cold) to be rare.|$|E

5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations {{in the composition of}} the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E
5|$|Outside a {{protective}} atmosphere and magnetic field, {{there are few}} obstacles <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> through space of energetic subatomic particles known as cosmic rays. These particles have energies ranging from about 106eV up to an extreme 1020eV of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 109eV, with approximately 87% protons, 12% helium nuclei and 1% heavier nuclei. In the high energy range, the flux of electrons is only about 1% of that of protons. Cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers. According to astronauts, like Don Pettit, space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment, similar to the scent of an arc welding torch.|$|E
5|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, {{the general}} {{principle}} was that landlords were not liable for injuries suffered by third parties on their property. The 1957 Act qualified this, providing in Section 4 (repealed by the Defective Premises Act) that where a landlord was obligated by his tenant to repair property and he breached this obligation, third parties injured {{as a result}} of the breach would be able to claim providing that the tenant could. This provision was limited; it provided no remedy to the tenant himself, and only applied to lawful visitors, not trespassers. In addition, it only came into effect if the landlord was obliged to repair the property; if he simply had the option to do so, there was no remedy for an injured third party. Similarly, if a tenant failed to inform the landlord of something needing repair, any resulting injury could not be sued upon.|$|E
