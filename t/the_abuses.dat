News of his death spread quickly, and became a symbol of <b>the</b> <b>abuses</b> perpetrated under the apartheid government. Biko's position as an individual who had never been convicted of a crime led to the death being reported in the international press; he thus became one of first anti-apartheid activists widely known internationally.|$|E

50|$|However the {{alternative}} explanation from Raison Oblige Theory {{is that an}} abused individual will rationalise the situation they are in {{and come to the}} conclusion that they themselves are in some way causing <b>the</b> <b>abuse.</b> This leads to the honest belief that they deserve <b>the</b> <b>abuse</b> and causes feelings of worthlessness. This results in <b>the</b> <b>abused</b> individual remaining loyal to their partner and failing to seek help, as they believe <b>the</b> <b>abuse</b> is their fault and that they need to improve in some way in order that <b>the</b> <b>abuse</b> will stop.

5|$|By 1790, on the {{political}} front, the Commonwealth had deteriorated into such a helpless condition that it was forced into an unnatural and ultimately deadly alliance with its enemy, Prussia. The Polish-Prussian Pact of 1790 was signed, giving false hope that the Commonwealth might have at last found an ally that would shield it while it reformed itself. The May Constitution of 1791 enfranchised the bourgeoisie, established {{the separation of the}} three branches of government, and eliminated <b>the</b> <b>abuses</b> of Repnin Sejm. Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of its neighbours, wary of the potential renaissance of the Commonwealth. Again Poland dared to reform and improve itself without Russia's permission, and again the Empress Catherine II was angered; arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical Jacobinism then at high tide in France. Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth in 1792.|$|E

In 1555 his old Franciscan adversary Toribio de Benavente Motolinia wrote a letter in which he described Las Casas as an ignorant, arrogant troublemaker. Benavente described indignantly how Las Casas had once denied baptism to an aging Indian who had walked many leagues to receive it, only on the grounds that he did not believe that the man had received sufficient doctrinal instruction. This letter, which reinvoked the old conflict over the requirements for the sacrament of baptism between the two orders, was intended to bring Las Casas in disfavour. However, it did not succeed.|$|E

He said that the officers allegedly abused eleven other suspects, using such measures as electro-shock. The suit was brought by the People's Law Office attorneys who had represented Andrew Wilson in the 1989 police brutality case. The suit described 23 incidents against black and Hispanic suspects between 19721985.

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine the exact number of properties destroyed during and after Operation Storm, since a large number of houses had already sustained damage {{since the beginning of the}} war. Human Rights Watch (HRW) estimates that more than 5,000 homes were destroyed during and after the battle. Out of the 122 Serbian Orthodox churches in the area, one was destroyed and 17 were damaged, but most of the damage to the churches occurred prior to the Serb retreat. HRW also reported that the vast majority of <b>the</b> <b>abuses</b> during Operation Storm were committed by Croatian forces. These abuses, which continued on a large scale for months afterward, included summary executions of elderly and infirm Serbs who remained behind and the wholesale burning and destruction of Serb villages and property. In the months following Operation Storm, at least 150 Serb civilians were summarily executed and another 110 persons forcibly disappeared. One such example is the Varivode massacre, in which nine Serb civilians were killed.|$|E

40|$|Abuse of Public Law in Judicial Decisions This thesis {{discusses}} the relevance {{and meaning of}} the principle of "abuse of law" in Czech public law, and consists of six chapters. A brief opening chapter sets out the aim of the thesis, namely to provide a theoretical analysis of <b>the</b> concept of <b>abuse</b> of law, using conclusions that are established in Czech jurisprudence. The second chapter deals with the substantial rulings of the Czech Supreme Court viewing <b>the</b> <b>abuse</b> of law concept in terms of civil law, because <b>the</b> <b>abuse</b> of law principle came to light firstly in Czech civil law. The prospective enactment of <b>the</b> <b>abuse</b> of law principle in the Czech Civil Code Bill is also mentioned.

5|$|In the present, former Imperial knight Yuri Lowell goes on {{a mission}} to {{retrieve}} his neighborhood's blastia core from a nobleman when their reservoir fails. While on his mission, he encounters a noble woman called Estelle, and flees with her from the capital in pursuit of the blastia thief. On their journey, they also meet Karol, a trainee hunter separated from his guild; a blastia researcher named Rita; Raven, a Great War veteran; Judith, a Krytia who seeks to destroy the blastia harming the aer balance; and exclusive to the PS3 version only, seemingly the descender of a legendary pirate Aifread named Patty Fleur. Together, the group recover the stolen core from a corrupt guild leader and return it to Yuri's friend and former fellow knight Flynn. Yuri and Karol then decide to form an independent guild called Brave Vesperia. Shortly after this, Estelle is attacked by an Entelexeia called Phaeroh, who accuses her of poisoning the planet. After investigating and meeting a second time with Phaeroh, Brave Vesperia learn that Estelle is a Child of the Full Moon, capable of converting aer into magic without the aid of a blastia core, and that her actions are causing the aer krene, the sources of aer, to overproduce aer with deadly results. Alongside these events, Yuri sees that the Imperial authorities are powerless to act against powerful figures involved in blastia abuse: he takes matters into his own hands and murders two officials connected to <b>the</b> <b>abuses.</b> These acts put a strain on his friendship with Flynn.|$|E
5|$|To {{counteract}} {{the power of}} the Imperial Household Department and the Manchu nobility, in July 1653 the Shunzhi Emperor established the Thirteen Offices (十三衙門), or Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus, which were supervised by Manchus, but manned by Chinese eunuchs rather than Manchu bondservants. Eunuchs had been kept under tight control during Dorgon's regency, but the young emperor used them to counter the influence of other power centers such as his mother the Empress Dowager and former regent Jirgalang. By the late 1650s eunuch power became formidable again: they handled key financial and political matters, offered advice on official appointments, and even composed edicts. Because eunuchs isolated the monarch from the bureaucracy, Manchu and Chinese officials feared a return to <b>the</b> <b>abuses</b> of eunuch power that had plagued the late Ming. Despite the emperor's attempt to impose strictures on eunuch activities, the Shunzhi Emperor's favorite eunuch Wu Liangfu (吳良輔; d. 1661), who had helped him defeat the Dorgon faction in the early 1650s, was caught in a corruption scandal in 1658. The fact that Wu only received a reprimand for his accepting bribes did not reassure the Manchu elite, which saw eunuch power as a degradation of Manchu power. The Thirteen Offices would be eliminated (and Wu Liangfu executed) by Oboi and the other regents of the Kangxi Emperor in March 1661 soon after the Shunzhi Emperor's death.|$|E
5|$|Because of the 1976 {{disturbances}} and {{the subsequent}} arrests, mistreatment and dismissals of worker militants, a group of intellectuals led by Jacek Kuroń, Antoni Macierewicz, Jan Józef Lipski and Adam Michnik founded and operated the Workers' Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Robotników; KOR). The aim of the KOR was to assist the worker victims of the 1976 repression. Working to support the spontaneous workers' movements, the dissidents recognized the necessarily predominant role {{of the working class}} in resisting <b>the</b> <b>abuses</b> of the regime and the newly formed opposition increasingly became characterized by an alliance of intelligentsia with workers. The KOR, according to Modzelewski, constituted the core of organized opposition and a seed of political alternative; clearing the way for other opposition formations, it engendered political pluralism. More opposition groups indeed soon followed, including the Movement for Defense of Human and Civic Rights (ROPCiO), Free Trade Unions of the Coast (WZW) and the Confederation of Independent Poland (KPN). The periodical Robotnik ("The Worker") was distributed in factories from September 1977. The idea of independent trade unions was first raised by the Gdańsk and Szczecin workers striking in 1970–71, but was later developed and promoted by the KOR and its leftist collaborators, which led to the establishment in 1978 of Free Trade Unions, the precursor of Solidarity. The KPN represented the minority at that time right-wing of the Polish opposition scene. The opposition members tried to resist the regime by denouncing it for violating the Polish constitution, Polish laws and Poland's international obligations. They fit within the post-Helsinki Soviet Bloc human rights movements {{and for the most part}} had not yet developed more radical, anti-system orientations.|$|E

5|$|More than 21,000 {{members of}} the AIF were {{captured}} by the Japanese during {{the first months of}} 1942. Most of these men were {{members of the}} 8th Division captured at Singapore, the NEI and Rabaul, but about 2,000 members of the I Corps party sent to Java in early 1942 were taken prisoner there. Throughout captivity these POWs were treated harshly, resulting in a high death rate. Australians were held in camps across the Asia-Pacific region and many endured long voyages in grossly overcrowded ships. While most of the Australian POWs who died in Japanese captivity were the victim of deliberate malnutrition and disease, hundreds were murdered by their guards. The Burma-Thai Railway was the most notorious of the prisoner of war experiences, as 13,000Australians worked on it at various times during 1942 and 1943 alongside thousands of other Allied POWs and Asians conscripted by the Japanese; nearly 2,650Australians died there. Thousands of Australian POWs were also sent to the Japanese home islands where they worked in factories and mines in generally harsh conditions. The POWs held in camps at Ambon and Borneo suffered the highest death rates; 77percent of those at Ambon died and few of the 2,500Australian and British prisoners in Borneo survived; almost all were killed by overwork and a series of death marches in 1945. Overall, only 14,000 of the Australian prisoners taken by the Japanese survived captivity. The majority of these deaths were caused by malnutrition and disease. The treatment of the POWs prompted many Australians to remain hostile towards Japan after the war.

40|$|Summary: Children's {{long-term}} {{response to}} sexual abuse {{is likely to}} be influenced by its context, such as the location of <b>the</b> <b>abuse,</b> <b>the</b> severity of <b>the</b> <b>abuse,</b> their relationship to the abuser, and whether they disclose <b>the</b> <b>abuse.</b> In this study, we examine whether these factors increase the likelihood that children will experience panic attacks during adulthood. Findings: This secondary analysis relied on a convenience sample of 92 participants who were recruited through community advertisements. In the multivariate model, adults who were injured during <b>the</b> sexual <b>abuse,</b> were sexually abused outside their home, who reported <b>the</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> was incest, and who were in midlife were more likely to experience panic attacks. Disclosing abuse and wanting to disclose abuse, but being unable to, were not related to panic attacks. Applications: The results of this exploratory study need to be verified by other researchers using a larger sample. For children, discussing the location of <b>the</b> <b>abuse</b> could lead to a conversation about safe spaces and protective strategies. CorrespondingNo Full Tex...|$|R
