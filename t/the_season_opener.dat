5|$|Throughout the offseason, Croyle {{was given}} every {{opportunity}} to win the starting job over Damon Huard. Against the New Orleans Saints while Huard sat out with a calf injury, Croyle completed only 5 of 17 passes for 45 yards as the Chiefs lost 30–7 and dropped to 0–3 in exhibition. but poor play in the pre-season led to Huard being named the Chiefs' starting quarterback for <b>the</b> <b>season</b> <b>opener</b> against the Houston Texans.|$|E

5|$|Although the Giants {{had one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} seasons in franchise history in 1990, the season had a difficult beginning as Taylor held out of training camp, demanding a new contract with a salary of $2 million per year. Talks reached September with no progress. As the season approached Taylor received $2,500 dollars a day in fines for not reporting. Taylor signed a contract just four days before <b>the</b> <b>season</b> <b>opener</b> against the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite barely practicing since the previous season, he started and finished with three sacks and a forced fumble.|$|E
5|$|Bruichladdich Radical {{remained}} in the Le Mans Series in 2008, but had an all-new driver line-up of Jens Petersen, Jan-Dirk Leuders and Marc Rostan. <b>The</b> <b>season</b> <b>opener,</b> which was the 1000 km of Catalunya, saw the team finish 15th overall, and seventh in class. However, {{the rest of the}} season was unsuccessful, as the team did not finish above 30th overall in any of the remaining LMS races, or the 24 Hours of Le Mans; although 30th at the 1000km of Spa equated to seventh in class, due to attrition. As a result, the team slipped to joint-eleventh in class, with four points.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland posted an 11–1 {{record in}} 1951, losing their only game to the San Francisco 49ers in <b>the</b> <b>season</b> <b>opener.</b> That gave the Browns another {{spot in the}} {{championship}} game, again against the Rams. This time, however, the Rams won 24–17. Graham fumbled {{the ball in the}} third quarter, setting up a touchdown that put the Rams ahead 14–10.

5|$|McCarty {{made the}} active roster and played in all 18 regular season games his rookie season. He {{was used in}} the passing game and on the special teams, {{finishing}} with seven receptions for 99 yards and a touchdown as well as five special-teams tackles. McCarty made his CFL debut on June 28 in <b>the</b> <b>season</b> <b>opener</b> against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.

5|$|McCoy led the Longhorns, {{who were}} ranked number {{four in the}} {{pre-season}} Associated Press Poll and Coaches Poll, to a 21–13 victory over unranked Arkansas State in <b>the</b> <b>season</b> <b>opener.</b> McCoy threw two touchdown passes and two interceptions. He also made two quick-kick punts when the Longhorns lined up {{as if they were}} attempting to convert on fourth down. He averaged thirty yards per kick and both kicks were downed inside the opponent's twenty yard-line. In the second game, McCoy led the Longhorns to a 34–13 victory over #19-ranked TCU.|$|E
5|$|Ruth {{also noticed}} these {{vacancies}} in the lineup; he was dissatisfied {{in the role}} of a pitcher who appeared every four or five days and wanted to play every day at another position. Barrow used Ruth at first base and in the outfield during the exhibition season, but he restricted him to pitching as the team moved towards Boston and <b>the</b> <b>season</b> <b>opener.</b> At the time, Ruth was possibly the best left-handed pitcher in baseball, and allowing him to play another position was an experiment that could have backfired.|$|E

5|$|The {{months before}} the 1997 season opener {{featured}} uncertainty over the quarterback position. Junior Scott Dreisbach had started 11 games for the 1996 team, but fifth-year senior Brian Griese had relieved Driesbach in the Ohio State game after Driesbach was injured and helped the team recover from a 9–0 deficit.

5|$|Written by David Fisher, {{this story}} was {{discussed}} with Script Editor Douglas Adams in late 1979, shortly before Adams left Doctor Who.

5|$|After much speculation, Manning {{announced}} in the offseason that he would return for his 18th season in the NFL. In <b>the</b> <b>season</b> <b>opener</b> against the Baltimore Ravens, Manning's play seemed to have deteriorated, going 24–40 for 175 yards and one interception, but a pick-6 by cornerback Aqib Talib allowed the Broncos to win 19–13. The Broncos {{got off to a}} dominant 7–0 start to the season; however, the streak ended in a loss at Indianapolis, losing 24–27. During that winning streak, and the loss in Indianapolis, Manning played better, putting up over 250 yards in six of the seven games, and he scored nine touchdowns. However, he never had a game without an interception, bringing his 8-game TD–INT ratio to 9–13, and the Broncos needed a hardworking defense to contribute for victories.|$|E
