5|$|In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords {{has held}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the {{decision-making}} process that the public authority is required to engage in determines whether a matter falls into the precedent fact category. If the process is complex and much discretion is accorded to the authority by the empowering statute, the court is unlikely to find that a precedent fact is involved. On the other hand, where an administrative decision interferes with an individual's liberty, the matter will be considered within the precedent fact category unless Parliament has explicitly excluded judicial review. If Parliament intends to do so, it must make its meaning crystal clear.|$|E
5|$|Obligatory {{psychological}} {{testing for}} gun owners {{is a common}} subject of discussion, but {{it has always been}} rejected. Gun advocates point out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the tests and the parties responsible for them are not clear. It is also pointed out that it is unlikely that any psychological testing would reveal a potentially dangerous individual, because some famous killers in the past were members of the military or the law enforcement and passed very difficult psychological testing successfully.|$|E
5|$|Teo's counsel {{submitted}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> {{and conditions}} of her detention rendered the detention unlawful. The Court of Appeal accepted that detention that was prima facie lawful can become unlawful if the nature or conditions of the detention fall below some minimum standard of treatment, but that extremely inhuman conditions must be shown to exist. In general, where {{the manner in which}} the detention is conducted is alleged to be unlawful, the detainee's remedy is to challenge the validity of the conditions of the detention, not the lawfulness of the detention itself.|$|E

5|$|The Ingenuity Gap is a non-fiction book by Canadian {{academic}} Thomas Homer-Dixon. It {{was written}} {{over the course}} of eight years from 1992 to 2000 when it was published by Knopf. The book argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of problems faced by our society are becoming more complex and that our ability to implement solutions is not keeping pace. Homer-Dixon focuses upon complexities, unexpected non-linear results, and emergent properties. He takes an inter-disciplinary approach connecting political science with sociology, economics, history, and ecology.|$|E
5|$|The book {{begins by}} looking at religion, {{specifically}} God as non-being and as being, put by Stace as the negative and positive divine. Stace then defines two orders of being - time and eternity, which he says intersect {{in the moment of}} mystic illumination. He goes on to say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of God or eternity is such that all religious language is symbolic and that it is necessarily subject to contradictions.|$|E

5|$|The book {{consists}} of five chapters, {{from which the}} five lectures were derived: Context, Pandemic, Education, Women, and Solutions. Before these chapters are sections titled Preface and Acknowledgments, and afterwards a Glossary section. The book's second edition contains an Afterword section written in May 2006. In the Preface, written by Lewis in August 2005, he states that his preferred genre is the spoken word and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the topic would not allow him to comprehensively cover every aspect. He justifies his writing by proclaiming himself a devotee to the United Nations and outlines the roles he has held with the organization since 1984. In the first chapter, Lewis tells anecdotes of visits to Africa and other UN-related events like, in 1986, brokering the resolutions from the General Assembly's 13th Special Session. He acknowledges colonialism and Cold War ideologues as historical influences on the African situation, but focuses {{on the effects of}} international finance institutions' conditional loans since the late 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{opponents of}} VSU liken fees to council rates or taxes – an {{unpleasant}} but necessary payment for those services which by necessity must be communally provided. VSU proponents respond that student unions are fundamentally not governments {{and should not}} have the right to compel money from people; they also argue that most union services – food, childcare, second-hand bookshops, etc. – already operate in the private sector, sometimes at cheaper prices than the subsidised equivalents. Opponents note that facilities such as playing fields and emergency student loans would have to be taken up by universities since they would almost certainly not be available through the private sector. Opponents of VSU cite <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of advocacy and representation fall beyond what could be put to market forces, they further state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of such services prevent them from effectively functioning from within the university, therefore Student Associations must be entrusted to carry out these services.|$|E
25|$|Within Shinto it is {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of life is sacred, because the kami began human life.

25|$|In the Theravada tradition, {{suffering}} {{arises when}} one identifies with or {{clings to the}} aggregates. This suffering is extinguished by relinquishing attachments to aggregates.

The use of the skandhas concept to explain the self is unique to Buddhism among major Indian religions.
