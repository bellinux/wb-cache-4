5|$|In the January 1997 State of the Union address, Clinton {{proposed}} a new initiative {{to provide health}} coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy—a Democrat—and Orrin Hatch—a Republican—teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in {{the years of the}} Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act.

In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.|$|E

25|$|In 1934, Peadar O'Donnell {{and other}} left-wing {{republicans}} left the IRA and founded <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Congress.</b> For a brief time, they revived the ICA as a paramilitary force, {{intended to be}} an armed wing for their new movement. According to Brian Hanley's history of the IRA, the revived Citizen Army had 300 or so members {{around the country in}} 1935. However, the Congress itself split in September 1934 and led to an ICA split with it. One fraction was led by Michael Price and Nora Connelly which had left congress while the opposing fraction led by O'Donnell and Roddy Connelly were loyal to those that stayed.|$|E
25|$|President Obama also {{attempted}} to address inequality before taxes (i.e., market income), {{with an increase}} in the minimum wage and infrastructure investment. While <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Congress</b> did not support a federally-mandated {{increase in the minimum wage}}, 18 states did increase their minimum wages, benefiting an estimated 7 million workers, following the President's 2013 State of the Union speech calling for an increase. During late 2015, the House and Senate, in rare bipartisan form, passed the largest infrastructure package in a decade, costing $305 billion over five years, less than the $478 billion in Obama's initial request.

40|$|The {{problem with}} which this {{investigation}} is concerned is the description and. analysis of President Harry S Truman's use of his Presidential prerogative in recalling <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Eightieth <b>Congress</b> into special session on July 26, 1948. The results of this investigation indicate that President Truman's call for a special session of the Eightieth Congress on July 26, 1948, was primarily a tactic in his campaign strategy for the election of that year. However, the full significance of the session can be understood only by {{taking into account the}} political environment of the postwar period and the executive-legislative relationships between President Truman and <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Eightieth <b>Congress</b> on domestic legislation. The special session was a microcosm of the political events of 1948 and the relationship between the President and the Eightieth Congress...|$|R
25|$|The Great Recession {{had caused}} federal {{government}} revenues {{to fall to}} their lowest level relative {{to the size of}} the economy for 50 years, with tax revenues falling nearly $400 billion (20%) between 2008 and 2009. At the same time, safety net expenditures caused expenditures to rise considerably. For example, automatic stabilizer spending (such as unemployment compensation, food stamps, and disability payments, which increased without legislative action) ranged between $350–420 billion annually from 2009 to 2012, roughly 10% of the expenditures. This drove the budget deficit up even without any policy steps by President Obama, creating significant debt concerns. This resulted in a series of bruising debates with <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Congress,</b> which attempted (with much success) to blame the President for the deficits caused primarily by the recession that began during the Bush administration.|$|E
25|$|President Obama pledged {{before he}} was elected not to raise taxes except on those couples earning over $250,000 (200,000 for individuals). With the Bush tax cuts {{extension}} scheduled to expire in January 2013, President Obama had significant leverage with <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Congress,</b> as his veto of further extensions {{would have resulted in}} a sizable income tax increase across the income spectrum, a significant expansion of government, but contrary to his pledge. His compromise, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), passed by a wide majority in the Senate, with both Democrats and Republicans supporting it, while a majority of Republicans in the House opposed it. It extended the Bush tax cuts for roughly the bottom 99% of income earners (those earning below $400,000, or $450,000 for married couples).|$|E
25|$|Their banner was the Plough and the Stars. Connolly {{said the}} {{significance}} of the banner was that a free Ireland would control its own destiny from the plough to the stars. The symbolism of the flag was evident in its earliest inception of a plough with a sword as its blade. Taking inspiration from the bible and following the internationalist aspect of socialism it reflected the belief that war would be redundant with the rise of the Socialist International. This was flown by the Irish Citizens Army during the 1916 rising. The design changed during the 1930s to that of the blue banner on the left, which was designed by members of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Congress,</b> and was adopted as the emblem of the Irish Labour movement, including the Irish Labour Party, though they eventually dropped it. It is also claimed by Irish republicans and has been carried alongside the Irish tricolour and Irish provincial flags at Official IRA, Provisional IRA, Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), Irish People's Liberation Organisation (IPLO) and Continuity IRA rallies and marches.|$|E
50|$|Some {{of these}} men on both sides saw the Spanish {{conflict}} as a continuation of Ireland's own civil war.

25|$|His {{subsequent}} book, {{released in}} summer 2006, is titled Conservatives without Conscience, {{a play on}} Barry Goldwater's book The Conscience of a Conservative. In it, he asserts that post-Goldwater conservatism has been co-opted by people with authoritarian personalities and policies, citing data from Bob Altemeyer. According to Dean, modern conservatism, specifically in the Christian Right, embraces obedience, inequality, intolerance, and strong intrusive government, {{in stark contrast to}} Goldwater's philosophies and policies. Using Altemeyer's scholarly work, he contends that there is a tendency toward ethically questionable political practices when authoritarians are placed in positions of power, and that the current political situation is dangerously unsound because of it. Dean cites the behavior of key members of the Republican leadership, including George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Tom DeLay, Newt Gingrich, and Bill Frist, as clear evidence of a relationship between modern right-wing conservatism and this authoritarian approach to governance. He places particular emphasis on the abdication of checks and balances by <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Congress,</b> and of the dishonesty of the conservative intellectual class in support of the GOP, {{as a result of the}} obedience and arrogance innate to the authoritarian mentality.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, the act {{raised the}} value of {{inherited}} estates and gifts that could be sheltered from taxation. Gingrich has been credited with creating {{the agenda for the}} reduction in capital gains tax, especially in the [...] "Contract with America", which set out to balance the budget and implement decreases in estate and capital gains tax. Some Republicans felt that the compromise reached with Clinton on the budget and tax act was inadequate, however Gingrich has stated that the tax cuts were a significant accomplishment for <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Congress</b> in the face of opposition from the Clinton administration. Gingrich along with Bob Dole had earlier set-up the Kemp Commission, headed by former US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp, a tax reform commission that made several recommendations including that dividends, interest, and capital gains should be untaxed.|$|E
500|$|Blaine was reelected in 1864 and, {{when the}} 39th Congress {{assembled}} in December 1865, {{the main issue}} was the Reconstruction of the defeated Confederate States. Although {{he was not a}} member of the committee charged with drafting what became the Fourteenth Amendment, Blaine did make his views on the subject known and believed that three-fourths of the non-seceded states would be needed to ratify it, rather than three-fourths of all states, an opinion that did not prevail and placed him, atypically, in the radical camp. <b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Congress</b> also played a role in the governance of the conquered South, dissolving the state governments President Andrew Johnson had installed and substituting military governments under Congress’ control. Blaine voted in favor of these new, harsher measures, but also supported some leniency toward the former rebels when he opposed a bill that would have barred Southerners from attending the United States Military Academy. Blaine voted to impeach Johnson in 1868, although he had initially opposed the effort. Later, Blaine was more ambiguous about the validity of the charges against Johnson, writing that “there was a very grave difference of opinion among those equally competent to decide," [...] but at the time partisan zeal led him to follow his party’s leaders.|$|E
