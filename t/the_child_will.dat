5|$|Aristotle's {{theory has}} some symmetry, as semen {{movements}} carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the semen is {{hot enough to}} overpower the cold menses, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> be a boy; {{but if it is}} too cold to do this, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> be a girl. Inheritance is thus particulate (definitely one trait or another), as in Mendelian genetics, unlike the Hippocratic model which was continuous and blending.|$|E
5|$|Captain Archer {{meets with}} Samuels, who is {{concerned}} that news of <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> stir xenophobic sentiment. Lieutenant Reed is ordered by Archer to liaise with Harris of Section 31. He is informed that Khori {{was a member of}} Terra Prime, an anti-alien movement. Meanwhile, in the Terra Prime headquarters on the Moon, John Frederick Paxton and Doctor Mercer discuss the child. After Mercer leaves, Paxton sends for Daniel Greaves and tells him to deal with Mercer. On Earth, Archer tells Samuels that he knows that the minister was a former member of Terra Prime and convinces him to provide a case file on Khouri. Meanwhile, Ensign Mayweather gives his reporter ex-girlfriend, Gannet Brooks, a tour of the ship.|$|E
5|$|In the meanwhile, her father's {{fishing boat}} is {{taken away by}} creditors. He sinks {{into a state of}} sadness and begins to drink away their savings. On one occasion, Vanaja’s {{superior}} intellect pits her against Shekhar in a public incident which ultimately humiliates him in front of his mother. Matters escalate, and one day Vanaja is raped by Shekhar. She eventually loses her job when she becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a boy, much against Rama Devi’s wishes who would have liked her to abort the foetus. Vanaja hopes that the physical evidence of <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> be proof of the rape and that somehow Shekhar will be brought to justice. However, Shekhar has no desire to marry Vanaja because she is from a lower caste. In the end Rama Devi and Shekhar gain possession of the child, who will grow up to be an upper caste boy.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{practice}} {{is to call}} the same person Giannis Eleftheriou: the proper name is vernacular (and not Ioannis), but the surname is an archaic genitive.

25|$|Children come {{equipped}} with universal grammar, from which any natural human language will develop – without instruction. All {{that is needed}} is passive input during the critical period—defined in linguistics as that period within which a child must have necessary and sufficient exposure to human language so that language acquisition occurs; without sufficient exposure to primary linguistic data, the UG {{does not have the}} necessary input for development of an individual grammar; this period is commonly recognized as spanning from birth to adolescence, generally up to the age of 12 years, though individual variations are possible. If what the child predominantly hears (or sees via sign) as it is maturing through this critical period is the English spoken in Topeka, Kansas, then that is what <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> acquire. This is why, regardless of a child's ethnic/racial background (or any other non-relevant factor, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> know Cockney English, Egyptian Arabic, or isiZulu if the child's primary linguistic input is Cockney English, Egyptian Arabic, or isiZulu, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturers {{and health}} {{officials}} advise {{it is very}} important to measure powders or concentrates accurately to achieve the intended final product concentration; otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> be malnourished.

Proper refrigeration is essential for any infant formula which is prepared in advance.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the birth}} or {{adoption}} of a first child, married parents may choose by which surname <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> go (mother's or father's but not both).

25|$|Examples of {{children}} raised under the Kibbutz system of equality are given by Yosef Criden. When an aunt {{from a nearby}} city comes to visit her niece or nephew and brings a box of chocolate as a present for them, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> excitedly open it up and eat {{a few of the}} chocolates. Then <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> go over {{to the rest of the}} group and give the rest of the chocolates to their peers. This is the ideology instilled in the children, to value the self but also to always think about others. Another example Yosef gives is that when his son, who was born and raised on a kibbutz, went into the army, he and his fellow bunk mates asked their supervising officer for a box. They wanted to keep the box in the middle of the room and whenever they would get care packages, they would put the items into the box and share them communally. They did not want to be like most of the units of officers from towns and cities, where each officer would hide their packages under their beds.|$|E
25|$|Vidal finds Ofelia {{talking to}} someone (the faun) whom Vidal cannot see. Vidal takes the baby from her arms and fatally shoots Ofelia; then, when he reaches the labyrinth's entrance, he is {{surrounded}} by the rebels who have taken over the outpost. Knowing {{that he will be}} killed, he hands the baby to Mercedes, demanding that she tell his son the exact time of his father's death. Mercedes replies that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> never know so much as his name. Her brother Pedro kills Vidal.|$|E
25|$|This theory also {{includes}} the concept of modes of incorporation, which are the external factors within the host community that affect assimilation. These factors are created by the underlying policies of the government, the strength of prejudice in the society, and the makeup of coethnic communities within the society. These modes of incorporation affect how a child will assimilate into U.S. society, and determine how vulnerable <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> be towards downward assimilation. Factors that enhance such vulnerability include racial discrimination, location, {{and changes in the}} economy that have made it harder for intergenerational mobility.|$|E

25|$|Triple X {{syndrome}} is not inherited, but usually, occurs as an event during {{the formation of}} reproductive cells (ovum and sperm). An error in cell division called nondisjunction can result in reproductive cells with additional chromosomes. For example, an oocyte or sperm cell may gain an extra copy of the X chromosome {{as a result of}} the non-disjunction. If one of these cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> have an extra X chromosome in each of her cells. In some cases, trisomy X occurs during cell division in early embryonic development.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} this {{experiment}} several results were found. First, younger children have a discriminative ability that shows the logical capacity for cognitive operations exists earlier than acknowledged. This study also reveals that young children can be equipped with certain qualities for cognitive operations, depending on how logical the structure of the task is. Research also shows that children develop explicit understanding at age 5 and as a result, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> count the sweets to decide which has more. Finally the study found that overall quantity conservation is not a basic characteristic of humans' native inheritance.|$|E
25|$|A {{child with}} the anxious-avoidant {{insecure}} attachment style will avoid or ignore the caregiver – showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. <b>The</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> not explore very much {{regardless of who}} is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or {{turn away from the}} caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorised that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants is in fact as a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.|$|E

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 1 in 25,000 babies born in the United States will {{have some form of}} the mucopolysaccharidoses. It is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that only individuals inheriting the defective gene from both parents are affected. (The exception is MPS II, or Hunter syndrome, in which the mother alone passes along the defective gene to a son.) When both people in a couple have the defective gene, each pregnancy carries with it a one in four chance that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> be affected. The parents and siblings of an affected child may have no sign of the disorder. Unaffected siblings and select relatives of a child with one of the mucopolysaccharidoses may carry the recessive gene and could pass it to their own children.|$|E

Isidora's father finds a husband for her, {{but in the middle}} of the wedding celebrations, Melmoth tries to abduct Isidora. Her brother tries to intervene, and Melmoth kills him. Isidora falls senseless and Melmoth escapes. Isidora reveals that she is already married, to Melmoth. She gives birth, but she and her baby daughter are imprisoned by the Inquisition. The inquisitors threaten to take away the child, but find that it is already dead. Isidora, dying of grief, remembers her island paradise, and asks if 'he' will be in the heavenly paradise.|$|E
25|$|Typically, primary {{education}} {{is provided in}} schools, where <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> stay in steadily advancing classes until they complete it {{and move on to}} secondary schooling. Children are usually placed in classes with one teacher who will be primarily responsible for their education and welfare for that year. This teacher may be assisted to varying degrees by specialist teachers in certain subject areas, often music or physical education. The continuity with a single teacher and the opportunity to build up a close relationship with the class is a notable feature of the {{primary education}} system. Pursuant to The Education Act, school attendance is compulsory for {{children between the ages of}} 7 and 16 years. In addition, schooling is provided to anyone between the ages of 6 to 21 years. Both primary and secondary education are free.|$|E
