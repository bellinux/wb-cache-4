40|$|Abstract: The paper studied {{enhanced}} {{treatment of}} sewage from discharging points of rivers by bio-film process dosing with enzyme and investigated the promotion effect of enzyme on {{treatment of sewage}} by bio-film process. The removal of phenol in sewage was also researched. The experiments results indicated that during the ebb tide, the remove rate of phenol was stable (33 %) on <b>the</b> eighth <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dosing pools and it was stable (31. 6 %) on <b>the</b> eighth <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> contrast pool. During the rising tide, the remove rate of phenol was stable (30 %) on <b>the</b> eighth <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dosing pools and it was stable (27. 2 %) on <b>the</b> eighth <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> contrast pool. It indicated that enzyme had good promotion effect on bio-film process during the sewage treatment process.

5|$|Impala feed on {{soft and}} nutritious grasses such as Digitaria macroblephara; tough, tall grasses, such as Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, are {{typically}} avoided. Impala {{on the periphery}} of the herds are generally more vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual will try to defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that time spent in foraging reaches a maximum of 75.5% of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early dry season (57.8%).|$|E
5|$|In the wild, {{little brown}} bats {{can be very}} active during <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring months, {{where they can be}} heard loudly squeaking, {{shuffling}} position and seen hanging out the bottom of the bat house during all hours of the daytime. The average sleep time of a little brown bat in captivity is said to be 19.9 hours per day. This long period of sleep is thought to be a way of conserving energy, by only hunting for a few hours each night when their insect prey are available.|$|E
5|$|Social {{aggregation}} is {{well documented}} in grey reef sharks. In the northwestern Hawaiian Islands, large numbers of pregnant adult females have been observed slowly swimming in circles in shallow water, occasionally exposing their dorsal fins or backs. These groups last from 11:00 to 15:00, corresponding to peak daylight hours. Similarly, at Sand Island off Johnston Atoll, females form aggregations in shallow water from March to June. The number of sharks per group differs from year to year. Each day, the sharks begin arriving at the aggregation area at 09:00, reaching a peak in numbers during the hottest part of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon, and dispersing by 19:00. Individual sharks return to the aggregation site every one to six days. These female sharks are speculated to be {{taking advantage of the}} warmer water to speed their growth or that of their embryos. The shallow waters may also enable them to avoid unwanted attention by males.|$|E

5|$|Wright's {{scientific}} paintings adopted {{elements from}} {{the tradition of}} history painting but lacked the heroic central action typical of that genre. While ground-breaking, they are regarded as peculiar to Wright, whose unique style has been explained in many ways. Wright's provincial status and ties to the Lunar Society, a group of prominent industrialists, scientists and intellectuals who met regularly in Birmingham between 1765 and 1813, have been highlighted, {{as well as his}} close association with and sympathy for the advances made in the burgeoning Industrial Revolution. Other critics have emphasised a desire to capture a snapshot of the society of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tradition of William Hogarth but with a more neutral stance that lacks the biting satire of Hogarth's work.|$|E
5|$|After a rest {{day on the}} Sunday of the game, England resumed on Monday with England still 223 runs in arrears. The Nottinghamshire {{secretary}} H. A. Brown broadcast {{an appeal}} to the spectators via the public address system, urging them to refrain from barracking Miller. In response, they clapped when the Australians took to the field. The chairman of Nottinghamshire reportedly apologised to Bradman in private regarding the crowd reaction to Miller. Taking the new ball in the fifth over of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> overcast conditions that morning, Miller bowled a relatively full length, rather than bouncers, and swung the ball; one of his deliveries beat Hutton and narrowly missed his stumps. Shortly after a break for bad light, he bowled Hutton with an off cutter. This brought in Hardstaff, who was dropped from his third delivery by Arthur Morris at slip. In the remainder of the over, Hardstaff played and missed, then edged two further balls; the second edge went for four runs through the slips. During the morning session, Bradman used Miller for 11 overs in a row to pressurise the Englishmen.|$|E

5|$|On 15 and 16 May, another {{attempted}} Soviet {{offensive in}} the north met the same resistance encountered on the three {{first days of the}} battle. German bastions continued to hold out against Soviet assaults. The major contribution to Soviet frustration in the battle was the lack of heavy artillery, which ultimately prevented the taking of heavily defended positions. One of the best examples of this was the defense of Ternovaya, where defending German units absolutely refused to surrender. The fighting was so harsh that, after advancing an average of five kilometers, the offensive stopped for <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north. The next day saw a renewal of the Soviet attack, which was largely blocked by counterattacks by German tanks; the tired Soviet divisions could simply not hold their own against the concerted attacks from the opposition. The south, however, achieved success, much like the earlier days of the battle, although Soviet forces began to face heavier air strikes from German aircraft. The Germans, on the other hand, had spent the day fighting holding actions in both sectors, launching small counterattacks to whittle away at Soviet offensive potential, while continuously moving up reinforcements from the south, including several aircraft squadrons transferred from the Crimea. Poor decisions by the 150th Rifle Division, which had successfully crossed the Barvenkovo River, played a major part in the poor exploitation of the tactical successes of the southern shock group.|$|E
5|$|The {{final mass}} test session {{before the new}} season {{took place at the}} track over 1–3 April.

An overnight sandstorm caused the second day's running to be delayed for one hour while circuit officials cleaned the track. Sergey Sirotkin was the fastest driver in the morning session with a lap of 1:41.797, and Nobuharu Matsushita recorded the quickest lap of the afternoon session with a time of 1:40.191. Pierre Gasly recorded the fastest lap time of the three days, a 1:39.632 in the morning session, and Nigel Melker was the quickest driver in the afternoon session with a lap of 1:41.566.

Team principal Franz Hilmer was confident that he would enter {{the second round of the}} season in Catalunya.|$|E
5|$|While some {{cockatoos}} are generalists {{taking a}} wide range of foods, others are specialists. The glossy black cockatoo specialises in the cones of trees of the genus Allocasuarina, preferring a single species, A. verticillata. It holds the cones in its foot and shreds them with its powerful bill before removing the seeds with its tongue. Some species take large numbers of insects, particularly when breeding; in fact the bulk of the yellow-tailed black cockatoo's diet is made up of insects. The large bill is used in order to extract grubs and larvae from rotting wood. The amount of time cockatoos have to spend foraging varies with the season. During times of plenty they may need to feed for only a few hours in <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning and evening, then {{spend the rest of the}} day roosting or preening in trees, but during the winter most of the day may be spent foraging. The birds have increased nutritional requirements during the breeding season, so they spend more time foraging for food during this time. Cockatoos have large crops, which allow them to store and digest food for some time after retiring to a tree. During hard times, the cockatoos also display versatility in their diet, travelling widely in order to find food, feeding on more green plant material and in some species using their large bills to dig up corms.|$|E
