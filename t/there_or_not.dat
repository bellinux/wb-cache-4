500|$|The 12th {{district}} leaned Republican, {{the more}} so after 1941 when the Republican-dominated California State Legislature attempted to gerrymander Congressman Voorhis out of office by removing strong Democratic precincts in East Los Angeles from the district during the decennial redistricting. [...] The revamped 12th district had little industry and almost no union influence. [...] Voorhis was left with such Republican strongholds as San Marino, where he did not campaign, concluding that he would receive {{the same number of}} votes whether he visited <b>there</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> [...] Despite the maneuvers of the Republicans in the legislature, Voorhis was re-elected in 1942, receiving 57% of the vote, and won with a similar percentage two years later. Voorhis had not faced strong opposition prior to 1946. [...] In his initial election, Voorhis benefited from the Roosevelt landslide of 1936. [...] His 1938 opponent was so shy that Voorhis had to introduce him to the crowd at a joint appearance. [...] In 1940, he faced Captain Irwin Minger, a little-known commandant of a military school, and his 1942 opponent, radio preacher and former Prohibition Party gubernatorial candidate Robert P. Shuler, [...] "embarrassed GOP regulars". In 1944, the 12th district Republicans were bitterly divided, and Voorhis easily triumphed.|$|E

2500|$|In the Talmud {{the origin}} of the temple of Onias is narrated with legendary additions, there being two {{versions}} of the account. Here also Onias is mentioned as the son of Simon, and that Isaiah's prophecy is referred to. In regard to the Law the temple of Onias (Beit Honio, or [...] "House of Onias", handed down in the name of Saadia Gaon as Beit Honi) was looked upon as forbidden, though there is a question as to whether idolatry was done <b>there</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> The possibility of the priests of Onias being admitted to officiate at Jerusalem was explicitly stated, while one passage even expresses the view that sacrificial worship was permissible in the temple of Onias, however, this view was rejected, and is based on the view that idolatry was not performed there. The opinion was prevalent among the Rabbis that the temple of Onias was situated at Alexandria—an error that is repeated by all the chroniclers of the Middle Ages. This temple is also sometimes confounded with the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim.|$|E
2500|$|However, visuo-spatial {{short-term}} memory can retain visual and/or spatial information over brief periods of time. [...] When this memory is in use, individuals {{are able to}} momentarily create and revisit a mental image that can be manipulated in complex or difficult tasks of spatial orientation.There are some who have disparities {{in the areas of}} the brain that allow for this to happen from different types of brain damage. There can also be a misunderstanding here in the differences between transient memories such as the visual sensory memory. A transient memory is merely a fleeting type of sensory memory. [...] Therefore, as the visual sensory memory is a type or sensory memory, there is a store for the information, but the store last for only a second or so. [...] A common effect of the visual sensory memory is that individuals may remember seeing things that weren't really <b>there</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> remembering particular things that were in their line of sight. [...] The memory is only momentary, and if it isn't attended to within a matter of seconds, it is gone.|$|E

2500|$|Seven years later, {{after months}} of {{bullying}} by Madison Drake (Seraphina Beh) and Alexandra D'Costa (Sydney Craven), Louise (now Tilly Keeper) is pushed onto lit candles by Alexandra at her school prom, causing her to suffer burns. She is taken to hospital and Lisa arrives. Sharon is furious with Lisa's absence and that Sonia contacted her. Lisa and Sharon argue over Phil being away in Italy and leaving Louise. Louise chooses Sharon to remain whilst she is given pain relief over Lisa and Sharon tells Lisa how Louise gained her injuries. Lisa insists on caring for Louise instead of Sharon. Lisa tells Sharon that Louise wanted to live with Phil when she got a new boyfriend, which she admits was a relief. She is furious that Sharon went to Italy with Phil and Louise {{was left in the}} care of her former sister-in-law Michelle Fowler (Jenna Russell), who she never has met. Sharon gives Lisa the choice of being <b>there</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> for Louise and she opts to remain. Louise argues with Lisa over feeling abandoned and getting the blame, but opens up to Lisa, admitting she is scared. Lisa meets Louise's half-brother, Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid) and Lisa criticises Ben's past behaviour towards Louise. Lisa apologises to Ben and they make amends as Phil turns up, who is unimpressed with Lisa's presence and Lisa, Sharon and Louise ask Phil to give Lisa a chance. Lisa apologises to Phil for the past mistakes regarding Louise and says that they both need to be there for her, but Phil physically throws Lisa out of the hospital, ordering her to stay away from Louise. Lisa stays with Louise at the hospital and Lisa stands up to Phil, telling him she is not going and Phil allows Lisa to visit Louise. Phil warns Lisa not to mess up. Lisa sees her therapist and lies that she has been doing fun things with Louise. Louise's best friend Bex Fowler (Jasmine Armfield) goes to see Louise, but Lisa says Louise has requested no visitors and Lisa tells Bex her plans for Louise if she was well. Louise is distressed when Lisa and Bex arrange for her boyfriend Travis Law-Hughes (Alex James-Phelps) to visit her. Lisa talks to herself as she watches Louise with Phil, Sharon and Bex. Lisa takes keys to Phil's house and lets herself in, talking to and smashing photos, but cuts herself on glass. Lisa arrives distressed in the café and Sonia consoles her. The doctor gives Lisa consent to take Louise outside and Lisa tells Louise she has been discharged. Lisa plans to take Louise, going to Liverpool Street station. Phil and Sharon find Louise's room empty and the doctor reassures them of Lisa and Louise's whereabouts, although they find Louise's belongings gone. Phil is angry as the doctor explains how Louise is at a crucial stage in her recovery and the police tell Phil and Sharon what they are doing. Phil and Sharon are told Lisa switched cabs and find Lisa's flat, which is empty. Louise wakes up and Lisa lies to her that she and Phil agreed for her to be away from the square while Phil and Sharon question Lisa's capabilities. The police, Phil and Sharon discuss Lisa being traced through her cash withdrawals in Castle Point and that she has a mental health team. [...] Louise is in agony without her medication and Lisa prevents Louise from using the phone by cutting the cord. Louise figures out Lisa is off her medication. Louise's phone dies as she tries to phone the police and Lisa prevents Louise from leaving, but when Lisa allows her to go, Louise chooses to stay with and comfort Lisa when she is distressed. Bex gives Phil and Sharon information on a hotel where Lisa and Louise are at and compared to Sharon, Phil shows a lack of regard to Lisa's mental health. Phil finds Louise and she wants him to leave. Phil gains entry to their room and Lisa hits Phil over the head with a phone. Phil shouts at a struggling Lisa as Louise deteriorates and Lisa and Louise go to hospital together.|$|E
