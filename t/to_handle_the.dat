5|$|Before {{the opening}} of Melbourne Airport, Melbourne's main airport was Essendon Airport which was officially {{designated}} an international airport in 1950. In the mid-1950s, over 10,000 passengers were using Essendon Airport and the limitations of Essendon Airport were beginning to become apparent. Essendon Airport's facilities were insufficient to meet the increasing demand for air travel; the runways were too short <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> then new jet airliners and the terminals failed <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> increase in passengers, by the mid-1950s, an international overflow terminal was built in a new northern hangar. Due to the encroachment of the urban boundary, the airport had become surrounded by residential housing, meaning that expansion of Essendon Airport was not possible.|$|E
5|$|Charlton's major {{acquisition}} for the 1979–80 {{campaign was}} signing Yugoslavia international midfielder Ante Miročević for a £200,0000 fee from FK Budućnost Podgorica.

5|$|Although Dean's {{landfall}} in Mexico {{occurred in}} a relatively uninhabited area and the storm's well-predicted track gave ample warning, the storm inflicted extreme damage.

Quintana Roo Governor Félix González Canto reported that although the cleanup in the state capital of Chetumal was completed within three weeks, it took more than six months to fix all of the region's more rural roads. Unable <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> hurricane's aftermath, the state government appealed to federal authorities for aid.

The ULA cannot maintain the display during SAVE and LOAD operations, as it has to operate continuously to maintain the correct baud rate for data transfers.

Using a basic blueprint from Apple, including a list of chips and other components, and the Portable's architecture, the 100 was miniaturized and manufactured by Sony in San Diego, California, and Japan. Sony engineers had little experience building personal computers but nonetheless completed Apple's smallest and lightest machine in under 13months, cancelling other projects and giving the PowerBook100 top priority. Sony president Norio Ohga gave project manager Kihey Yamamoto permission to recruit engineers from any Sony division.|$|E
