40|$|International audienceThe main {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to present the authors' view of- and results on non-linear lateral stability of rail vehicles in a curved track. Three elements are exploited in order to secure this objective. Firstly, physical genesis of the problem is discussed, and its similarity to <b>straight</b> <b>track</b> analysis is emphasized. Results of the theories of self-exciting vibrations and bifurcation are the key elements here. Secondly, the method suitable for analysis in a curved track is presented. New necessary elements, extending the better established methods for <b>straight</b> <b>track</b> are clearly mentioned and described. The methodology of building original stability maps, being the basis for the analysis and valid for whole range of curve radii and <b>straight</b> <b>track</b> is represented. Thirdly, a sample of the analysis is shown in order to give the idea how the method can be utilised. The case study refers to the influence of wheel/rail profiles on the stability in circularly curved <b>track</b> and <b>straight</b> <b>track</b> as well. Two different pairs of wheel/rail profiles are used and the corresponding results compared. The main contributions of the article are: a discussion of the physical nature of phenomena related to the stability in a curved tracks, and the method (procedure) established for the reasons of the analysis. Another and more general contribution is our say in the hot polemics on the advisability of stability analysis in curves and the advantages of the non-linear critical speed over the linear one...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the ridge}} which {{separates}} Las Flores Canyon from Millard Canyon, {{the right of}} way was cut around a bluff named Cape of Good Hope.

50|$|Due to its location, {{east of the}} IC mainline, trains {{running from}} Chicago to New Orleans would shave 22 miles (35 km) from their route by using the cutoff. Trains to and from St. Louis, however, would {{continue}} to use the old mainline through Cairo, as would all IC passenger trains. Even so, the cutoff would especially benefit heavy coal trains coming from western Kentucky. The gradient profile of the line was a significant improvement over the old mainline, with a maximum of a 0.3% grade versus 1.2% on the Cairo line. The number of curves was greatly reduced as well. In fact, one section of <b>tangent</b> (<b>straight)</b> <b>track</b> on the cutoff is 63 miles (102 km) long. Sidings were located along the cutoff to permit trains to pass {{each other on the}} single-track line. The construction of three tunnels was necessitated along the route, all of which are located within the remote forested region of southern Illinois.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} several {{powerful}} techniques which {{allow us to}} generate efficiently channel routing solutions which are beneficial to further compaction.

Our router also generated a routing solution which leads to a very satisfactory result after contour routing compaction. 1. Introduction In VLSI layout design, a significant portion of chip area is used for channel routing. The two-layer grid-based channel routing problem has been well formulated and studied extensively. There are several grid-based channel routers which can consistently produce channel routing solutions which are at most one or two tracks within optimal solutions [De 76, YoKu 82, RiFi 82, BuPe 83, ReS [...] ...|$|R
