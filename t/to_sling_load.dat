50|$|BPA now markets the {{electricity}} from thirty-one federal hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River and its tributaries, {{as well as}} from the Columbia Generating Station, a nuclear plant located on the Hanford Site in eastern Washington. BPA has more than 15,000 miles (24,000 km) of electrical lines and 300 substations in the Pacific Northwest and controls approximately 75 percent of the high-voltage (230 kV and higher) transmission capacity in the region. BPA also maintains connection lines with other power grids, the California high-voltage transmission system by Path 66, which consists of the two 500 kV AC lines of the Pacific AC Intertie, plus a third 500 kV AC line of the California-Oregon Transmission Project (COTP) (managed by the Balancing Authority of Northern California). Together these three lines are operated as the California-Oregon Intertie (COI) (managed by the California Independent System Operator). An additional DC +/- 500 kV line, the Pacific DC Intertie, links BPA's grid at the Celilo Converter Station near The Dalles, Oregon to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) grid 800 miles (1,300 km) away at the Sylmar Converter Station in Los Angeles.BPA uses helicopters <b>to</b> <b>sling</b> <b>load</b> maintenance workers inspecting and repairing power lines.|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} aimed at finding the causes of {{controllability}} variations of a helicopter while transporting sling load. The maximum angular acceleration taken by the helicopter at similar controller displacement at different flight speeds was taken as a quantity characteristic of controllability efficiency to study the load impact on the helicopter cont- rollability. This article offers research results obtained {{with the use of}} the НеliСargо software. This software has proven to be a great tool for integrated research of the impact of an underslung load on the parameters of a helicopter controllability, and allows carrying out an analysis of the impact of an underslung load on the parameters of controllability under its dyna- mic behavior. The performed computational experiments have shown that the helicopter maximum angular acceleration with an underslung load significantly rises, as compared to a helicopter without cargo or a helicopter carrying the same load inside the cargo compartment. The data obtained during computational experiments corresponds to the results of analytical computations, and is in line with the literature based on the experience of helicopter flight operations. The cause of the variation in the helicopter controllability parameters during transportation of an underslung load has been found, that is - the underslung load considerably increases the main rotor thrust, due <b>to</b> <b>sling</b> <b>load,</b> as compared to a helicopter without cargo. When compared to a helicopter carrying a load inside the cargo compartment, this increased efficiency is mainly attributed to the fact that a helicopter with an underslung load has lower rotational inertia, since the load is not inside the cargo compartment, but outside. The obtained results can be used to improve flight manuals and flight personnel training publications, which could play a significant part in ensuring flight safety and security, and increasing the operational efficiency of helicopters with external slung load systems...|$|E

In order <b>to</b> support <b>sling</b> <b>load</b> operations, the control of the load - damping and stabilization of the load pendulum swing - can be automatized by means of feedback of the load dynamic. The load pendulum controllers are integrated into an existing AFCS, featuring limitations in actuator rate and saturation. Based on a comprehensive simulation of the overall helicopter-slings-load system, an algorithm for the automatic determination of optimal feedback controllers has been developed. Selected controllers are tested for the potential of increasing the load pendulum damping and for the robustness under parameter variations...|$|R

The desired end objective is a set of operational flight envelopes for the rotorcraft with intended loads that can be provided to the user to guide operations in the field.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the analytical investigations {{which have been}} performed in preparation for flight testing of a flight director for helicopter with <b>sling</b> <b>load.</b> The flight director developed at DLR gives the pilot a convenient aid to effectively damp the load pendulum motion and to allow manoeuvring without exciting oscillatory load modes.

The flight director was flight tested on DLR's BO 105 using mainly two different types of external load: a relatively heavy tree log with a basic stable behaviour and a relatively light aerodynamic effective body with only marginal stability properties prone to a coupled lateral pendulum-yaw mode.

40|$|Helicopter {{external}} air transportation {{plays an important}} role in today's world. For both military and civilian helicopters, external <b>sling</b> <b>load</b> operations offer an efficient and expedient method of handling heavy, oversized cargo. With the ability to reach areas otherwise inaccessible by ground transportation, helicopter external load operations are conducted in industries such as logging, construction, and fire fighting, as well as in support of military tactical transport missions. Historically, helicopter and load combinations have been qualified through flight testing, requiring considerable time and cost. With advancements in simulation and flight test techniques there is potential to substantially reduce costs and increase the safety of helicopter <b>sling</b> <b>load</b> certification. Validated simulation tools make possible accurate prediction of operational flight characteristics before initial flight tests. Real time analysis of test data improves the safety and efficiency of the testing programs. To advance these concepts, the U. S. Army and NASA, in cooperation with the Israeli Air Force and Technion, under a Memorandum of Agreement, seek to develop and validate a numerical model of the UH- 60 with <b>sling</b> <b>load</b> and demonstrate a method of near real time flight test analysis. This thesis presents results from flight tests of a U. S. Army Black Hawk helicopter with various external loads. Tests were conducted as the U. S. first phase of this MOA task. The primary load was a container express box (CONEX) which contained a compact instrumentation package. The flights covered the airspeed range from hover to 70 knots. Primary maneuvers were pitch and roll frequency sweeps, steps, and doublets. Results of the test determined the effect of the suspended load on both the aircraft's handling qualities and its control system's stability margins. Included were calculations of the stability characteristics of the load's pendular motion. Utilizing CIFER(R) software, a method for near-real time system identification was also demonstrated during the flight test program...|$|R

The determination of the loads through the rigging system must be a consideration whilst calculating the load resistant model, refer to the examples shown in Figure 3.|$|R
