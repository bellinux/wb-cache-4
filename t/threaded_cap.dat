50|$|The prince's wand (also {{known as}} a penis plug) {{is a piece of}} body {{piercing}} jewelry. It consists of a hollow tube with a <b>threaded</b> <b>cap</b> at the end. The tube is inserted into the urethra, and a stem is inserted through a Prince Albert piercing and into another threaded hole {{on the side of the}} tube. The general shape is similar to a police nightstick. The little side stem holds the tube in place. The <b>threaded</b> <b>cap,</b> often just a ball, can be removed so the wearer can urinate through the hollow tube without having to remove the jewelry (from the Prince Albert piercing).|$|E

50|$|Threaded {{plug valves}} are used {{significantly}} in air-sensitive chemistry {{as well as}} when a vessel must be closed completely {{as in the case}} of Schlenk bombs. The construction of a threaded plug valve involves a plug with a <b>threaded</b> <b>cap</b> which are made so that they fit with the threading on a corresponding piece of female glass. Screwing the plug in part-way first engages one or more O-rings, made of rubber or plastic, near the plug's base, which seals the female joint off from the outer atmosphere. Screwing the plug valve all the way in engages the plug's tip with a beveled constriction in the glass, which provides a second seal. This seal separates the region beyond the bevel and the O-rings already mentioned.|$|E
50|$|The globe {{front sight}} {{consists}} of a hollow cylinder with a <b>threaded</b> <b>cap,</b> which allows differently shaped interchangeable front sight elements to be used. Most common are posts of varying widths and heights or rings or holes of varying diameter — these can be chosen by the shooter for the best fit to the target being used. Tinted transparent plastic insert elements may also be used, {{with a hole in}} the middle; these work the same way as an opaque ring, but provide a less obstructed view of the target. High end target front sight tunnels normally also accept accessories like adjustable aperture and optical systems to ensure optimal sighting conditions for match shooters. Some high end target sight line manufacturers also offer front sights with integrated aperture mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|The forward end of {{the forward}} section {{contains}} the air vessels, there are four in this section, one Type 93 torpedo air vessel flanked either side by 2 small trim tanks on the keel and three smaller vessels directly above it. The vessels are held in place simply with wood packing. The smaller air vessels are a proprietary design that took some heavy research to perfect. They are sealed by {{the pressure of the}} gas, as the pressure rises, a slackly <b>threaded</b> <b>cap</b> presses up against a sealing ring which is screwed down with another cap, thus making an airtight seal. Directly aft of the air vessels is the fuel tank which is ringed by the main forward trim tanks. The fuel tank is lightly constructed and contains baffles to prevent sloshing. Just behind this are the 4 steering air bottles.|$|E
40|$|The EP- 61 primary {{containment}} vessel of the 5320 shipping package {{has been used}} for storage and transportation of Pu- 238 plutonium oxide heat source material. For storage, the material in its convenience canister called EP- 60 is placed in the EP- 61 and sealed by two <b>threaded</b> <b>caps</b> with elastomer O-ring seals. When the package is shipped, the outer cap is seal welded to the body. While stored, the EP- 61 s are placed in a cooling water bath. In preparation for welding, several containers are removed from storage and staged to the welding booth. The significant heat generation of the contents, and resulting rapid rise in component temperature necessitates special handling practices. The test described here was performed to determine the temperature rise with time and peak temperature attained for an EP- 61 with 203 watts of internal heat generation, upon its removal from the cooling water bath...|$|R
5000|$|... 2. Insert pipes {{across the}} notch. In this case, as shown, the {{upstream}} pipes {{are made from}} 10 ft sections of perforated 4" [...] PVC pipe. The perforations allow water to enter the pipes. The upstream ends of the pipes have a 90 degree elbow pointing downward into the water, and are anchored to steel fence post supports at the upstream end of the pipes {{as well as in}} the notch. The perforated pipe is joined to non-perforated pipe at the notch, and then appropriate elbows are used to drop the pipes to the downstream position for water to exit. <b>Threaded</b> <b>caps</b> are placed on the final section, and then plugged with end caps. Steel fence post supports are used on the downstream portion as well to hold the pipes in position. Flexible galvanized wire is best to attache the pipes to the posts.|$|R
50|$|Plastisol is the {{standard}} lining material used in metal closures for vacuum packing glass bottles and jars. Plastisol is a flowed-in compound, usually a dispersion of PVC resins in plasticizers. It forms a solid, self-bonding, sealing gasket in the closures. Plastisol liners are used in metal twist-off and metal continuous <b>thread</b> screw <b>caps</b> for use on hot-pack food products where the preservation of a vacuum is essential.|$|R

50|$|The {{exposure}} meter uses a circular CdS cell 8.5 mm in diameter (coverage with 50 mm lens = 21°), {{and having a}} sensitivity of -0 (some estimates claim -1) - 20 Ev at 100 ASA (0.3-0.4 asb at f/1.4 to 200 000 asb; 0,06 to 32.000 cd/m2). Information from the {{exposure meter}} is displayed using a dual match needle system {{at the bottom of}} the viewfinder. An additional illuminator window at the top of the viewfinder illuminates the readout bar. The M5 exposure meter can be set from ISO 6/9° to ISO 3200/36°. The ASA/DIN film speed knob is designed to prevent inadvertent change. The meter's circuit is powered up by winding the camera, and shuts down when the shutter is released. The M5 exposure meter required the PX625 1.35 V mercuric oxide coin type cell which was banned because of its mercury content. The M5 continues to run on a number of alternatives including the WeincellTM MRB625. The battery compartment is located between the strap lugs. It is accessed by using a coin slot type <b>threaded</b> <b>cap</b> and is superior in design to that of the bayonet caps that surfaced as of the M6.|$|E
40|$|Recently, a cryovial {{immersed}} in liquid nitrogen exploded in a Yale laboratory, exposing a researcher to risk of physical injury {{and also to}} a biohazard. Liquid nitrogen that seeps into a closed tube can lead to an explosion upon removal from low temperature storage due to a 690 X volume expansion during conversion to gas from liquid phase. During the investigation, 2 additional reports of exploding cryovials {{within the past year}} were shared by other laboratory members. Laboratory staff noted that the cryovials involved in the explosion were {{immersed in}} liquid nitrogen and also were those containing external <b>threads</b> and female <b>caps.</b> Tubes immersed in liquid nitrogen that were equipped with internal <b>threads</b> and male <b>caps</b> have not been involved in explosions. Images of both vials are shown below. It is important to also note that manufacturers of both tube styles provide an alert that their tubes should NOT BE IMMERSED IN LIQUID NITROGEN DUE TO RISK OF EXPLOSION.

One end of transmission steel <b>cap</b> adopted <b>threaded</b> connection puller, while the other end was processed into a flat surface and stuck with the specimen. Acrylate adhesive was selected, whose tensile strength was up to 24  MPa, which met tensile test requirements of most rock.|$|R
40|$|LARES is a spherical passive {{satellite}} basically composed of one {{single piece of}} very dense material. Other elements are four equatorial <b>threaded</b> <b>caps</b> and 92 Cube Corner Reflectors each one maintained in place by three rings and three screws. It has been designed for optimising the measurement of the Lense-Thirring effect, derived from the theory of General Relativity. To avoid onset of unknown influences on the orbital motion, or perturbations difficult to model, the requirement to avoid any protruding part from the satellite surface has been imposed. LAGEOS satellites had also such a requirement but also {{a longer period of}} time to develop a particular separation system. As a consequence the separation system of LARES became a challenging engineering problem because of the short amount of time available for development and qualification. Current design of LARES satellite does not have protruding parts. Furthermore the separation system has to grab the satellite with minimal impact on the satellite surface. This aspect is of concern because LARES satellite will be put into a relatively low orbit with respect to the LAGEOS satellites and atmospheric drag may induce small perturbations on large cavities on the satellites that therefore have to be minimized. Current solutions adopted to overpass the challenges will be described...|$|R
5000|$|Regardless of {{the collet}} design, the {{operating}} principle is the same: squeeze the collet radially against the tool or workpiece to be held, resulting in high static friction. Under correct conditions, it holds quite securely. Almost all collet chucks achieve the radial squeezing motion via moving one or more male-female pairs of tapered (conical) surfaces axially, which produces the radial squeezing in a highly concentric manner. Depending on the collet design, it can be either pulled (via a threaded section {{at the rear of}} the collet) or pushed (via a <b>threaded</b> <b>cap</b> with a second taper) into a matching conical socket to achieve the clamping action. As the collet is forced into the tapered socket, the collet will contract, gripping the contents of the inner cylinder. (The axial movement of cones is not mandatory, however; a split bushing squeezed radially with a linear force—e.g., set screw, solenoid, spring clamp, pneumatic or hydraulic cylinder—achieves the same principle without the cones; but concentricity can only be had to the extent that the bushing's diameters are perfect for the particular object being held. Thus only in toolroom contexts, such as machine tool tooling creation and setup, is this common.) ...|$|E
50|$|In 2012, Olson Kundig Architects {{launched}} a steel accessories line, The Tom Kundig Collection, comprising over 25 hardware pieces that celebrate the kinetic moments {{that occur in}} buildings. The Tom Kundig Collection includes cabinet pulls, rollers, door knockers and knobs. Kundig collaborated with Seattle-based fabricator 12th Avenue Iron to manufacture the line. The architect explains {{in an interview in}} Dwell magazine, that the “simplest-looking pieces” (the Peel, Ear and Droop Ear cabinet pulls) are also the most rewarding—“they represent the collection at its most elemental.” He calls the higher-priced Roll and Disc rollers a “wink and a nod” to their complex fabrication. Their edited forms are, as Kundig says, “honest about how they are made and what they are made from.” According to Kundig, this line is the very first of many; now that he has begun to focus in this direction, he wants to keep going. “There are so many other products that I can’t find in the commodity market. Designing them myself and putting them out there for others to use seems like the right evolution.” The Tom Kundig Collection won a 2012 “Best of Year” award in the hardware category from Interior Design Magazine. In 2013, Kundig designed The Final Turn, a funerary urn, with Greg Lundgren, owner of Lundgren Monuments in Seattle. The urn consists of two halves of an eight- inch-diameter blackened steel or bronze sphere—the halves are threaded with a noticeable offset from one another when they meet. While the sphere implies perfection and eternity, the offset nature of the urn is inspired by the people left behind—those whose lives are thrown off-kilter by the passing of a loved one. “It’s a quiet reminder.” Kundig noted in a New York Times interview. A <b>threaded</b> <b>cap</b> atop the stem on the lower half provides access to the receptacle for the remains. The upper half includes a compartment designed to house mementos. Flat surfaces on the exterior accommodate inscriptions, if desired.|$|E

The top end (appearing to {{the left}} in Fig. 1) has a removable weatherproof <b>threaded</b> <b>cap,</b> while the bottom end appearing {{on the right is}} sealed. The tube is buried vertically in the ground so that approximately 15 cm of the top end of the tube lies exposed above ground. This allows the internal GPS antenna (the black disk {{to the left}}, pictured in Fig. 1) to receive adequate signal for generating a one-pulse-per-second (1 PPS) heartbeat or master timing signal. The top of the NPM housing is painted white to reflect solar radiation in order to reduce internal heat build-up.

Critical fastener is a term used to describe a cap screw that, upon failure, causes immediate engine shutdown or possible harm to person. So, determination of {{fatigue strength}} is important. S-N method is used for cap screw fatigue strength determination by testing number of samples at different alternating load keeping mean load constant. Alternating load is increased until cap screws begin to fail. But for measurement of axial load in fasteners, ultrasonic bolt gauging method is used.
