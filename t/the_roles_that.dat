5|$|Cadets today {{live and}} work within the {{framework}} of the Cadet Leader Development System (CLDS), which specifies <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>that</b> a cadet plays throughout their four years at the academy. Cadets begin their USMA careers as trainees (new cadets), then advance in rank, starting as CDT Privates (freshmen) and culminating as CDT Officers (seniors). Freshmen have no leadership responsibilities, but have a host of duties to perform as they learn how to follow orders and operate in an environment of rigid rank structure, while seniors have significant leadership responsibilities and significantly more privileges that correspond to their rank.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} theoretical analysis and examination of <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of imagination {{in the formation}} of an environmental ethos. The majority of ethical theories in environmental thought largely neglect <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>that</b> imagination plays in both the relationships that humans form with their environment, and <b>the</b> subsequent <b>role</b> <b>that</b> imagination plays in constituting the way that those relationships are understood ethically. To explore <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of imagination in constituting and subsequently projecting such an ethical way of being, this dissertation selectively analyzes the history of imagination in philosophy, cognitive science, and environmental thought. In addition, this dissertation also explores <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>that</b> images play in forming collective responses to environmental disasters, and <b>the</b> further <b>role</b> <b>that</b> imagination plays in overcoming the moral motivation gap...|$|R

25|$|After World War I broke out, {{the market}} for luxury horses {{suddenly}} became {{the market for}} military remounts. The increased availability of cars and tractors limited <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>that</b> horses could play in agriculture and transportation. Starting in the forties, technical advancements in agricultural machinery initially required {{a new type of}} horse, but soon after made the horse superfluous altogether in the field. So to adapt, starting in 1920 the direction changed radically: a heavy warmblood of great economy with a good walk, calm temperament, which matures early and utilizes its feed well. The type was so heavy, it stood on the boundary with the lighter coldbloods.|$|E
25|$|Other thinkers soon {{offered more}} ideas on <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>that</b> workers play in mature {{industrial}} systems. These included ideas on {{improvement of the}} individual worker with attention to the worker's needs, not just {{the needs of the}} whole. James Hartness published The Human Factor in Works Management in 1912, while Frank Gilbreth and Lillian Moller Gilbreth offered their own alternatives to Taylorism. The human relations school of management evolved in the 1930s to complement rather than replace scientific management, with Taylorism determining the organisation of the work process, and human relations helping to adapt the workers to the new procedures. Today's efficiency-seeking methods, such as lean manufacturing, include respect for workers and fulfillment of their needs as integral parts of the theory. (Workers slogging their way through workdays in the business world do encounter flawed implementations of these methods that make jobs unpleasant; but these implementations generally lack managerial competence in matching theory to execution.) Clearly a syncretism has occurred since Taylor's day, although its implementation has been uneven, as lean management in capable hands has produced good results for both managers and workers, but in incompetent hands has damaged enterprises.|$|E

Sellers was married four times, and had three children from his first two marriages. He {{died as a result}} of a heart attack in 1980, aged 54.

500|$|The most {{commonly}} recurring characters {{outside of the}} Earwicker family are the four old men known collectively as [...] "Mamalujo" [...] (a conflation of their names: Matt Gregory, Marcus Lyons, Luke Tarpey and Johnny Mac Dougall). These four {{most commonly}} serve as narrators, but they also play a number of active roles in the text, such as when they serve as the judges in the court case of I.4, or as the inquisitors who question Yawn in III.4. Tindall summarises <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>that</b> these old men play {{as those of the}} Four Masters, the Four Evangelists, and the four Provinces of Ireland ( [...] "Matthew, from the north, is Ulster; Mark, from the south, is Munster; Luke, from the east, is Leinster; and John, from the west, is Connaught").

Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode suffered from its attempt to balance comedy and horror, [...] "not having enough comedy to explore the premise properly, and not enough suspense to provide much drama". However, both Persky and Campbell were praised for their acting, despite the perceived shallowness of the latter's character. David Wharton of Cinema Blend called Campbell's performance [...] "lowkey" [...] and subtle, commenting that he portrayed Weinsider [...] "a bit less madcap than many of <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>that</b> he's known for". Wharton praised the casting, describing it as [...] "against type", which he claimed worked well because the material of the episode was more serious and dramatic than usual for the series.|$|E
