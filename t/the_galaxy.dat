The film was directed by James Gunn, who wrote the screenplay with Nicole Perlman, and features an ensemble cast including Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Lee Pace, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Djimon Hounsou, John C.

5|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} a location in <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> as {{being a part of}} the galactic habitable zone, a variety of factors must be accounted for.
