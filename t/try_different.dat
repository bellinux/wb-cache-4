Up to eight players on two teams of two to four players (or a four to eight player deathmatch) battle for control of a map in order to earn rewards from the gods. Players can also fight each other in one-on-one matches. Players must sell their champion's soul to either Zeus, Hades, Ares, or Poseidon, which allows players to <b>try</b> <b>different</b> weapons, armor sets, and powers inspired by the god of their choice, and extras can be unlocked.|$|E

Though only thirty-one years old, Bossy was forced to officially retire in October 1988. After his playing days were over, he was unable to play hockey or even work out because of his back and knees.|$|E

Usually matches get positive scores, whereas mismatches get relatively lower scores. A gap penalty function determines the score cost for opening or extending gaps. It is suggested that users choose the appropriate scoring system based on the goals. In addition, {{it is also a}} good practice to <b>try</b> <b>different</b> combinations of substitution matrices and gap penalties.|$|E
25|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor was {{published}} and developed by Atlus, namely {{by members of}} the recently acquired developer Career Soft. The game was designed so that newcomers of strategy games would enjoy them. Rather than simplifying the game system, Atlus mixed different gaming elements to create a new fighting system. Battles were designed so that players from previous Megami Tensei games would find it familiar. Features such as the Extra Turns provided by exploiting an enemy's weakness were based on classic Megami Tensei games. The game also reincorporates demons previously seen in the franchise while adding new ones with Kazuma Kaneko being responsible for the one known as Balder. The use of three characters per unit was designed to let the player <b>try</b> <b>different</b> combinations.|$|E

25|$|The {{first line}} of {{pharmacotherapy}} is usually SSRIs due to their more tolerable nature and reduced side effects compared to the irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants. Studies {{have found that the}} mean response to antidepressant medications for people with dysthymia is 55%, compared with a 31% response rate to a placebo. The most commonly prescribed antidepressants/SSRIs for dysthymia are escitalopram, citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine. It often takes an average of 6–8 weeks before the patient begins to feel these medications' therapeutic effects. Additionally, STAR*D, a multi-clinic governmental study, found that people with overall depression will generally need to <b>try</b> <b>different</b> brands of medication before finding one that works specifically for them. Research shows that 1 in 4 of those who switch medications get better results regardless of whether the second medication is an SSRI or some other type of antidepressant.|$|E
500|$|Development {{was marked}} by a few changes to the game's formula that would be reverted. Most notably, {{at one point during}} development, Klei wanted to add quests to the {{existing}} open gameplay. Klei shelved this idea when they realized that [...] "having external goals is extremely counter to what is fun about the game." [...] Nevertheless, Klei co-founder Jamie Cheng has emphasized that Klei values the freedom to <b>try</b> <b>different</b> approaches that being tied to a major publisher would not afford them.|$|E

She worked with Nellee Hooper in London on reggae-oriented material and with Lester Mendez in Los Angeles on acoustic songs.

David F. Friedman, another successful exploitation filmmaker of the era, has attributed the [...] "one-time-only" [...] distribution to a quality so low that Babb wanted to cash in and move to his next stop as fast as possible. At each showing of a film, a singing of [...] "The Star Spangled Banner" [...] was also required.|$|E

The fact that he won't move on until he's got exactly what he wants creates a safe environment, which allows me to experiment and <b>try</b> <b>different</b> things". [...] Cloke described her part as [...] "strong and sassy – in control. After the crash she comes unglued, probably more than any of the kids, and it's a quick, drastic change. I had to understand the psychology of a person who can turn on a dime like that".|$|E

Writing for Cartoon Brew, Amid Amidi speculated that both were commissioned following the success of Over the Garden Wall, the network's first miniseries created by Patrick McHale (a former writer for Adventure Time). Michael Ouweleen, the chief marketing officer of the network, later said that [...] "miniseries provide the network with more opportunities to <b>try</b> <b>different</b> creative textures and give new properties {{a chance to get}} on air." [...] Despite being touted by some outlets as a [...] "spin-off", Adventure Time showrunner Adam Muto later clarified that Stakes would air as part of the series' seventh season.|$|E

When Nelson Muntz bullies Bart, Stewie retaliates by {{kidnapping}} and torturing Nelson. [...] Meanwhile, Lisa tries to find a talent that Meg has. When she finds that Meg is a natural at the saxophone, she downplays the talent out of jealousy. Chris and Brian take the Simpsons' dog, Santa's Little Helper, for a walk. Brian tries to teach Santa's Little Helper independence, but the latter runs off when freed. Marge notices Santa's Little Helper is missing, and Chris and Brian fake his presence until he eventually returns.

500|$|The {{creative}} {{team had}} a number of opportunities to <b>try</b> <b>different</b> music to enhance an episode's storyline. Pyken and Wade-Reed chose and coordinated music on the show when Snow and Febre's scores were not used. In season three's [...] "Slumber", producer Ken Horton wondered if they could get a band to provide music for the entire episode. During a breakfast meeting with the music department of Warner Bros. R.E.M. was suggested, and Pyken and Wade-Reed immediately saw an opportunity to connect the episode's featured band with its story (which revolved around REM sleep). That season, Al Gough wanted to use Johnny Cash's cover of the Nine Inch Nails song [...] "Hurt" [...] for the final scene of [...] "Shattered" [...] (when Lionel Luthor looks at Lex through a one-way mirror at Belle Reve sanitarium) as soon as he read the episode's script. Cash died while Wade-Reed was trying to obtain the rights for the song and his heirs, believing that the song's use in the episode would honor his memory, gave Smallville the rights.|$|E
500|$|Frank {{credited}} Oxenfree {{with not}} relying on [...] "lazy, clichéd 'young person' speech"; reviewers {{also felt that}} the naturalistic dialogue of Oxenfree was a strength, while IGN's Kallie Plagge felt that characters such as Ren had grating or stilted dialogue. GamesTM and The A.V. Clubs William Hughes credited the game with delivering organic dialogue options that lacked any clear good or bad associations. GamesTM and other reviewers, such as VideoGamer.com's Tom Orry, felt the script sometimes failed to convey realistic panic or distress {{of the characters in}} their exceptional circumstances. Plagge noted that despite her efforts, some dialogue choices unavoidably hurt relationships in the game. [...] "It’s an important reminder that you can’t “win” social situations, and that kept Oxenfree’s supernatural plot points grounded in reality," [...] she wrote. Game Informers Kimberley Wallace felt that the opaque results of choices was sometimes a hindrance; [...] "something feels fundamentally wrong when players think they're influencing events in one direction, and the exact opposite happens instead," [...] she wrote. In contrast, Corriea appreciated that some consequences of dialogue choices did not become clear until much later in the game, encouraging repeat playthroughs to <b>try</b> <b>different</b> approaches.|$|E

But I {{was so bad that}} I wasn't allowed to play in a match", she recalled. She has stated on several occasions that she wants to continue acting, and has indicated that she would like to <b>try</b> <b>different</b> types of roles to challenge herself. Leandersson was a student at Gruvrisskolan. In an interview, she identified history as her favorite subject, because she finds it [...] "interesting to know how people lived and died in the past". She does not see school as a hindrance to continue acting, saying that she [...] "will just have to work harder than everyone else. But school isn't that difficult, it's quite easy." [...] She is a fan of the Twilight film series. In 2011-2014 years she is studying theatre at [...] ,a school for performing arts in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} season, Lana Wachowski took over {{many of the}} filmmaking aspects of the show, which {{combined}} with her sister's break, made her responsibilities as director shoot up. Production sound mixer Stevie Haywood recounted Lana's directing style was to use two cameras as the default setup, and develop the shot over [...] "enormously long takes" [...] which could last up to fifteen to twenty minutes. Additionally, {{the cast and crew}} under Lana did not use any rehearsals. [...] "We rehearse on camera effectively", said Haywood. If there were any technical issues Lana expected the cast to improvise and keep the shoot going instead of calling [...] "cut". Smith, Desai and Silvestre corroborated Lana's style of developing the shots on the set, her dislike for rehearsals, and the use of long takes, with the actors told to <b>try</b> <b>different</b> variations on how they play their parts. McTeigue returned as director for Mexico City. Tykwer returned as director for the Nairobi parts but not for the Berlin ones, as he was busy working on his own TV series, Babylon Berlin. According to Glass, in the second season he directed the second unit in Seoul, and he also did some directing in Berlin. Overall, six episodes of the second season, including the Christmas special, credit Lana as director, three credit McTeigue, and Tykwer and Glass get credited each in one.|$|E
500|$|Beholder {{initially}} {{developed a}} reputation as a [...] "temperamental diva." [...] As a young filly, she was prone to rearing when she got upset and later turned to bucking. [...] But the people who worked with her every day viewed her differently; her exercise rider in 2013, David Nuesch, described her as [...] "straightforward", explaining, [...] "she kind of likes it to be her idea and doesn't want to be told too much what to do." [...] Her groom, Ruben Mercado, said she was a [...] "little angel" [...] in the stables but [...] "all business" [...] on the track. Mandella used earplugs and a hood with ear coverings (colloquially called [...] "earmuffs") to help keep her focused. At one point, he tried giving her ear buds, but the sound upset her even more. Mandella was described as the [...] "perfect" [...] trainer for her, as he was willing to <b>try</b> <b>different</b> training techniques to keep her from getting in her own way, took the time to figure out her quirks, and learned to anticipate her behavior. [...] The bond and depth of communication between trainer and horse was noted in the press. Mandella's son Gary described Beholder as having an [...] "Alpha Male perspective," [...] explaining, [...] "She’s actually dominant, bullyish and head strong. She’s not quirky because she’s worried that something is lurking around the corner. The things that she does that are hard to manage are because she’s tougher than you." ...|$|E
