25|$|The Scots {{went into}} this tournament as favourites, being holders of the Intercontinental Cup and the ICC Trophy. However, rain in Utrecht {{prevented}} them from a good start against the Dutch, who bowled well enough to have them all out for 217 on the first day. Ian Stanger hit his second first-class fifty and Ryan Watson 46, but South African-born Ryan ten Doeschate took three important, albeit expensive, wickets and medium-pacer Edgar Schiferli finished with four for 46. In reply, Maurits van Nierop lashed out, taking 24 off the Scottish bowlers as the Dutch made 31 for 0 to see them to stumps on day 1. Play was impossible on the next two days, and the Scots now needed <b>to</b> <b>thump</b> Ireland in Aberdeen {{if they were to}} have any hope of qualifying for the semi-finals.|$|E
25|$|Geoff Pullar (56) and David Sheppard (53) added 114 for {{the first}}-wicket in 147 minutes, {{the first century}} opening stand for England in Australia since 1946-47. But they batted slowly and the left-handed Lancastrian never settled down properly. He edged a {{boundary}} through the slips, nearly chopped McKenzie onto his stumps and was dropped by Jarman. In the end Alan Davidson (3/43) slowed down his pace and had him caught and bowled after lunch. This brought Ted Dexter striding to the crease and he began <b>to</b> <b>thump</b> the ball off the boundary fence to take England to 182/2 by tea. Colin Cowdrey (9) was caught-and-bowled by Benaud (1/71) after the break, but Dexter and Ken Barrington hit 66 runs in 86 minutes to keep the game going. They were both out on 257, Dexter yorked by McKenzie (2/61) after a magnificent 99 - few doubted that he deserved a century - and Barrington caught off Davidson for 23. This ended any chance of England winning the game - they now needed 121 runs in 40 minutes - and the Australian fielders crowded around the wicket, {{but there was no}} miracle in store for them either. Peter Parfitt was caught by Jarman off McKenzie, but Fred Titmus and Barry Knight batted out the last half hour and they finished on 278/6.|$|E

5000|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Thumps</b> Colin Joyce, [...] "At the {{forefront}} of the genre is the absurdly prolific collective and label H.V.R.F. (short for Hardvapour Resistance Front). According to their Bandcamp, they're based in Pryp'Yat', Ukraine, a ghost town near the border the country shares with Belarus. It seems unlikely, however, that anyone associated with the collective is actually based there, given that the city was evacuated after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986." ...|$|R
60|$|The green men, {{a handful}} of them, had already reached the Thuria's deck, as Carthoris glanced in the {{direction}} the Lotharian had indicated. The sight that met his eyes set his heart <b>to</b> <b>thumping</b> in joy and relief--Thuvia of Ptarth might yet be saved? For from below there poured a stream of giant bowmen, grim and terrible. Not the bowmen of Tario or Jav, but the bowmen of an odwar of bowmen--savage fighting men, eager for the fray.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, John, I can't to-night, anyhow, because I have a headache. Just {{this talk}} has got my head <b>to</b> <b>thumping</b> so,--it's really dreadful! and I'm so low-spirited! I do {{wish you had}} a wife that would suit you better." [...] And {{forthwith}} Mrs. Lillie dissolved in tears; and John stroked her head, and petted her, and called her a nice little pussy, and begged her pardon for being so rough with her, and, in short, acted like a fool generally.|$|R

5000|$|Money issues {{began to}} surface between Mr.Capone-E and Thump, which {{ultimately}} led to unpaid royalties to Mr.Capone-E.

50|$|A 1-0 home {{win against}} Everton at Stamford Bridge coupled with another draw for Arsenal allowed Chelsea to top {{the table for}} the first time in the season. A week later, they {{retained}} their two-point lead at the top thanks <b>to</b> a <b>thumping</b> 1-4 away triumph at Fulham.|$|R
5000|$|Primarily R&B and {{alternative}} R&B, the album blends elements {{from a number}} of genres, including pop, folk, soul (including British soul and neo-soul), dub, funk, electronic, reggae, Qawwali ghazal, hip hop, classical, and soft rock. The album also channels different eras of music, including modern, retro, 1980s, and 1990s, while the moods of the album vary from slow ballads <b>to</b> <b>thumping</b> club jams. Despite the variations in the sounds and genres, Mind of Mine is structured in an [...] "album-as-complete-work" [...] form, maintaining a tightly knit cohesion throughout the record, with an almost seamless transition between and across songs, while maintaining a recognizable, mostly downbeat, [...] "hazy" [...] tone throughout. This gives the album a continuous flow, and gives the impression that it all came from one person's [...] "mind".|$|R
5000|$|For {{a jacket}} without a front strap, {{the most common}} way to escape is to hoist the arms over the head before undoing the crotch strap and at last the strap {{at the back of}} the neck. This allows the jacket to simply be peeled off upward over the head. The straitjacket escape was popularized by Houdini, who [...] "discovered" [...] it. Houdini first did it behind a curtain, forcing the {{audience}} <b>to</b> listen <b>to</b> <b>thumps</b> while watching a billowing curtain for many minutes. He found the trick went over better when the audience could see his struggles. In a few of his later and more popular acts, he performed the straitjacket escape while hung upside down from a crane, and also did the same when placed in a sealed milk can which was filled. Houdini's (and many other illusionists) acts shown the straitijacket in action, many ways possible.|$|R

6000|$|The stationer's heart begins <b>to</b> <b>thump</b> heavily, for his old apprehensions {{have never}} abated. It {{is as much}} as he can do to answer, [...] "No, sir, I can't say I do. I should have considered--not to put too fine a point upon it--that I never saw you before, sir." ...|$|E
40|$|No, {{this is not}} {{an entire}} issue devoted to abalone nacre. No, we aren’t {{dedicating}} an issue to the peacock greens of Tahiti. And we haven’t figured out how to use copper nuclei. This issue has been catalysed by a string of contemporaneous threads braiding themselves together over these past few months, perhaps this past year. We are seeing the ascension of pearls and pearl farming as the paragon of environmental consciousness. This could be: a) a head-in-the-sand response to the continuing market trends, b) an awakening of pearl farmers to their complete and utter dependence on how everyone else treats our oceans, c) recognition that pearl farming has now become mainstream, and is no longer a remote, arcane art, excluded from the other social forces that push or pull us, or d) all of the above.

5000|$|The Whiticker/Collis {{reference}} {{quotes a}} rather prosaic Labor Daily [...] {{in praise of}} both sides: “The {{ebb and flow of}} the grand final thrilled thousands who saw a great battle.

6000|$|Petey McGuff's {{smile was}} {{absolutely}} friendly.

60|$|In a {{very few}} minutes more the boat entered the surf, and soon began <b>to</b> <b>thump</b> as before at every {{rise and fall of}} the seas. But as each {{successive}} wave came up, she was lifted and carried farther over the bar, and at last came to deep water on the other side.|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Steele, a gray-haired, {{vigorous}} man, {{entered the}} gate and came hurriedly up the path, something fateful in his stride. He greeted them both casually, smilelessly.

60|$|They {{sat there}} {{in silence for a}} few moments. A promenading couple put their heads behind the screen, and withdrew with the sound of {{feminine}} giggling. Outside, the piano was being <b>thumped</b> <b>to</b> the tune of a popular polka.|$|R
6000|$|Two days later, toward noon, Sandy {{began to}} show signs of {{excitement}} and feverish expectancy. She said we were approaching the ogre's castle. I was surprised into an uncomfortable shock. The object of our quest had gradually dropped out of my mind; this sudden resurrection of it made it seem quite a real and startling thing for a moment, and roused up in me a smart interest. Sandy's excitement increased every moment; and so did mine, for that sort of thing is catching. My heart got <b>to</b> <b>thumping.</b> You can't reason with your heart; it has its own laws, and thumps about things which the intellect scorns. Presently, when Sandy slid from the horse, motioned me to stop, and went creeping stealthily, with her head bent nearly to her knees, toward a row of bushes that bordered a declivity, the thumpings grew stronger and quicker. And they kept it up while she was gaining her ambush and getting her glimpse over the declivity; and also while I was creeping to her side on my knees. Her eyes were burning now, as she pointed with her finger, and said in a panting whisper: ...|$|R
