5|$|In 1979, Conteh {{began working}} with <b>the</b> <b>CDC</b> and team leader Joseph B. McCormick at the Nixon Methodist Hospital in Segbwema. Conteh became Medical Superintendent of the {{hospital}} in 1980. The Sierra Leone Civil War broke out in 1991, forcing <b>the</b> <b>CDC</b> to close their program and move to Guinea. The hospital was destroyed in the conflict {{and the spread of}} Lassa fever grew worse. During the civil war, the Natal multimammate mouse infested abandoned houses, increasing the likelihood of infection.|$|E
5|$|The Reagan {{administration}} {{largely ignored}} the AIDS crisis, which began to unfold in the United States in 1981, {{the same year}} Reagan took office. AIDS research was chronically underfunded during Reagan's administration, and requests for more funding by doctors at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) were routinely denied. By {{the end of the}} first 12 months of the epidemic, when more than 1,000 people had died of AIDS in the U.S., <b>the</b> <b>CDC</b> had spent less than $1 million on AIDS research. In contrast, funding had been made amply available to <b>the</b> <b>CDC</b> in their efforts to stop Legionnaires' disease after an outbreak in 1976; <b>the</b> <b>CDC</b> had spent $9 million in fighting Legionnaires' disease, though the outbreak had caused fewer than 50 deaths.|$|E

5|$|As the {{chairman}} of <b>the</b> <b>CDC,</b> Ranariddh gave his approval to at least 17 business contracts submitted by Malaysian businessmen between August 1994 and January 1995. The projects mostly covered infrastructural development, and included construction of a racing track, power plants and petrol stations. In November 1994, <b>the</b> <b>CDC</b> opened a tender to build a casino near Sihanoukville and proposals submitted by three companies were shortlisted; Ariston Berhad from Malaysia, Unicentral Corporation from Singapore and Hyatt International from the US. Ariston's proposal was valued at USD 1.3 billion, and included bringing a luxury cruise ship with casino to Cambodia, {{to be used to}} accommodate tourists until the Sihanoukville resort was built. Before the tender was even concluded, Ariston's ship was brought to Phnom Penh in early December. The Tourism Minister, Veng Sereyvuth suspected that there was backroom dealing activities between CDC and Ariston, who were nevertheless awarded the contract, which Ranariddh signed in January 1995.|$|E
5|$|Because {{game animals}} can be shot using lead bullets, the {{potential}} for lead ingestion from game meat consumption has been studied clinically and epidemiologically. In a recent study conducted by <b>the</b> <b>CDC,</b> a cohort from North Dakota was enrolled and asked to self-report historical consumption of game meat, and participation in other activities that could cause lead exposure. The study found that participants' age, sex, housing age, current hobbies with potential for lead exposure, and game consumption were all associated with blood lead level (PbB).|$|E
50|$|First {{established}} in 1997, Community Development Councils (CDCs) were formed {{to help build}} a more cohesive, compassionate and self-reliant society. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>CDCs</b> offered local programmes {{to meet the needs of}} the residents in their districts. From 2001, the delivery of social services, including the development of childcare, student care and family care centres was devolved from the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports to <b>the</b> <b>CDCs.</b> As CDCs are closer to the ground, they are better able than government ministries to promptly address the needs of residents. <b>The</b> <b>CDCs</b> also play an important role in mobilising the community to help needy residents, including giving them interim financial assistance and helping them find jobs.|$|R

Dr. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears (Kate Winslet), an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, to Minneapolis to begin investigating. Mears traces the outbreak back to Emhoff while negotiating with local bureaucrats initially reluctant to commit resources for a proper public health response to the virus. Dr. Mears later becomes infected and dies.|$|E
