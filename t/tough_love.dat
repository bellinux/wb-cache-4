5|$|Teenagers {{have been}} {{participating}} in <b>tough</b> <b>love</b> behavior modification programs since the 1960s. Many {{of these programs}} {{take place in the}} wilderness in the style of military recruit training (also known as boot camps) and the teenagers are subjected to rigid discipline, including mandatory marches, physical abuse, solitary confinement, and deprivation of food and sleep. These programs have little to no oversight from the United States federal or state governments. Teenagers' claims of abuse at these facilities have not been investigated because the programs are not regulated.|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} Emotions: Mystery Or Madness, {{psychologist}} and psychiatrist Robert John McAllister highly recommended Help at Any Cost, {{and called it}} [...] "an excellent and informative {{book on the subject}} of the 'troubled-teen industry'", and [...] "important reading for any parent who is considering sending a teenager to a <b>tough</b> <b>love</b> program, a boot camp, or a wilderness program." [...] In a review of the book in Library Journal, Linda Beck commented: [...] "This book is excellent owing to its whistle-blowing approach: it exposes an unregulated industry and alerts adults to the severe harm inflicted by these 'schools.'" [...] She called the book [...] "chilling" [...] and [...] "Highly recommended for public libraries." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hey You!" [...] {{was written}} by Gwen Stefani and Kanal, with its {{production}} being handled by Matthew Wilder. The single is produced in D major, with Stefani's vocals ranging from A3–C5, layered {{with the use of}} a piano and guitars. It is a psychedelic rock and alternative rock track, with a genre similar to No Doubt's signature ska punk style. Its lyrics detail a [...] "cynical" [...] female protagonist hoping to get married. Kenneth Partridge, who wrote for both Billboard and The A.V. Club, stated that it has [...] "a neo-psychedelic '60s vibe that wouldn't have sounded out of place on a Bangles record". He went on to discuss the lyrics as [...] "a jaded Gwen gives some <b>tough</b> <b>love</b> to a girl dreaming of a white wedding" [...] in the lines [...] "You're just like my Ken and Barbie doll / Your name will never change". Mike Boehm, writing for the Los Angeles Times, stated that the [...] "canny arangement of Stefani's multitracked voice provide a poppy lift" [...] while Dumont, Kanal, and Young [...] "keep slickness at bay".|$|E

500|$|Weiss {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} the introduction of Lyanna Mormont in the series, with Weiss saying, [...] "We were excited {{about the prospect of}} the character because she's mentioned in passing in the previous season," [...] referring to her letter to Stannis denying him men, and swearing fealty to House Stark. Weiss added, [...] "The more we thought about it, Jon is going to come up against so many old guys with beards in the North that like 'What if she was a tougher audience?' It seemed like an inherently fun scene to watch, it also is terrifying because it's putting a lot of dramatic weight on the shoulders of somebody who needs to be very young." [...] David Benioff concluded the featurette speaking about the Ironborn story, noting [...] "Yara's not a therapist, in our kind of sense of the word, she's not there to tell him to 'buck up' and 'everything's going to be okay,' it's a pretty brutal kind of therapy, but that's who they are, I mean they're essentially a Viking people. There's not {{a lot of room for}} sort of soft, and gentle psychology. I think it's the kind of <b>tough</b> <b>love</b> Theon needed at this point, and when he finally raises his eyes, and looks into her eyes, we see a glimpse of the old Theon that had been lost for so long." ...|$|E
500|$|The Mercedes storyline was {{met with}} widely {{divergent}} reactions, though her musical numbers were generally given high marks. In addition to Urban, many reviewers were unhappy {{with the return of}} the Rachel versus Mercedes rivalry, including Bell, who lamented that it had [...] "been done every season". Nearly as many expressed the hope that Mercedes was not pregnant given her nausea in the first [...] "booty camp" [...] scene, including Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger, BuddyTV John Kubicek, and West. Benigno felt Mercedes was acting [...] "wildly out of character" [...] in the episode. Michael Slezak of TVLine was also puzzled at her change, and asked, [...] "When has Mercedes ever been anything other than a team player and New Directions MVP? Seriously, nobody's going to cut her slack for a bad week?" [...] Canning agreed, and wrote: [...] "Schue's <b>tough</b> <b>love</b> with Mercedes came out of left field", and felt it added to the [...] "inconsistency of these characters", even though [...] "it ultimately made sense" [...] in the context of setup for [...] "It's All Over". Time James Poniewozik wrote that having the story [...] "turn on her resentment at being overlooked by the glee club is an apt meta-touch, since she's been overlooked by the show for some time now." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was the most enthusiastic about her storyline, and called it [...] "the best part of the episode": it was [...] "all about how she now feels appreciated—because she has a boyfriend, sigh—and so she's willing to take on Rachel for the role of Maria (and, actually, beat her) and push for what she feels is rightfully hers, which involves more respect from New Directions." ...|$|E
500|$|Rashad {{has also}} {{garnered}} critical acclaim for her performance. Writing for AARP, Allan Fallow wrote that Rashad charmed audiences [...] "with her wholesome brand of comedy." [...] Robert Weintraub of The New York Times hailed Rashad as [...] "America’s mom, dispensing <b>tough</b> <b>love</b> {{with a straight}} face opposite Cosby’s comic mugging". Jason Bailey of Slate wrote that Rashad portrayed her character [...] "majestically", while The Huffington Posts Mlsee Harris praised the actress for playing Clair [...] "with class and poise from 1984 through 1992." [...] Writing for the same publication, Jennifer Armstrong dubbed Rashad [...] "a great ranter". Nick Hartel of DVD Talk reviewed that she [...] "perfectly ... captures some of his best caricatures of [...] own wife, Camille." [...] However, Time television critic Richard Zoglin criticized the actress for being [...] "too young by a decade". Rashad has won numerous awards and accolades for her performance over the course of two decades, including two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. Although she never won, Randee Dawn of Today felt that Rashad's performances during the show's first and last seasons were most deserving. Dawn elaborated, [...] "While it seems hard to imagine today, in 1984, finding a tough-minded, super smart, middle-class black woman on TV was all but unheard of, much less finding one who could contend with and occasionally upstage a legendary comedian." [...] Following her 1986 nomination, Rashad would remain the last African American actress to be nominated for an Emmy Award in that particular category for 30 years, until 2016. At the 15th People's Choice Awards in 1989, Rashad won in the category of Favorite Female TV Performer. Rashad also won two NAACP Image Awards. Former South African President Nelson Mandela once personally thanked Rashad for her contributions to The Cosby Show, which he claimed to have watched while imprisoned on Robben Island.|$|E
