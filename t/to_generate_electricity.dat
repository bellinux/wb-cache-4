5|$|Oklahoma Gas & Electric, {{commonly}} referred to as OG (NYSE: OGE) operates four base electric power plants in Oklahoma. Two of them are coal-fired power plants: one in Muskogee, and the other in Redrock. Two are gas-fired power plants: one in Harrah and the other in Konawa. OG was the first electric company in Oklahoma <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>electricity</b> from wind farms in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Most {{exploitation}} of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere, after {{which one can}} burn the shale directly <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>electricity,</b> or undertake further processing. The most common methods of surface mining involve open pit mining and strip mining. These procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. Underground mining of oil shale, which removes less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar method.|$|E
5|$|The Great Recession and {{the turmoil}} {{caused by the}} Arab Spring have {{depressed}} Jordan's GDP growth, damaging trade, industry, construction and tourism. Tourist arrivals have dropped sharply since 2011. Jordan's finances have also been severely strained by 32 attacks on the natural gas pipeline in Sinai supplying Jordan from Egypt by Islamic State affiliates, causing it to substitute more expensive heavy-fuel oils <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>electricity.</b> In November 2012, the government cut subsidies on fuel, increasing its price. The decision, which was later revoked, caused large scale protests to break out across the country.|$|E

5|$|In its time, Dunston B Power Station ranked {{consistently}} in England's leading stations, both {{in terms}} of thermal efficiency and cost per unit of electricity. However, the station eventually became outdated, and notification of its partial closure was given in October 1975, with some units being closed the following October. It was then only used as a stand-by station, operating only at peak electrical demand times. Finally, after some units having been in operation for about 40years, the station ceased <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>electricity</b> on 26 October 1981. At the time of closure, only 98MW of the station's capacity was in use.|$|E
5|$|North of Pentwater, US31 crosses into Mason County {{and passes}} Bass Lake and the Ludington Pumped Storage Power Plant, {{which uses a}} {{reservoir}} next to the freeway <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>electricity.</b> Just north of that reservoir, the freeway turns to the northeast and Ludington's business spur runs off to the northwest. US31 curves around {{the east side of}} Ludington, crossing the Pere Marquette River. Due east of downtown, the freeway ends and US31 turns east to merge with US10. The concurrent highways follow a four-lane roadway to Scottville. On the west side of that town, US31 separates from US10, turning northward to bypass Scottville.|$|E
5|$|The Western {{industrial}} {{revolution of the}} 18th to 19th centuries tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels. Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>electricity.</b> Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease. In the mid-20th century, a gathering environmental movement {{pointed out that there}} were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed.

50|$|Underground coal {{gasification}} (UCG) {{is a way}} of accessing energy from coal deposits that lie too deep underground or are too dangerous to be mined or are otherwise uneconomic. Air, oxygen or steam is injected at high temperatures, to burn the coal underground. Separate wells are drilled to capture the resulting “coal gas” which is in essence a form of natural gas. When combined with CCS, this offers a low-emissions route <b>to</b> <b>generating</b> <b>electricity</b> from coal.|$|R
5|$|Trying {{to come up}} with {{a better}} way to {{generate}} alternating current, Tesla developed a steam powered reciprocating electricity generator. He patented it in 1893 and introduced it at the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition that year. Steam would be forced into the oscillator and rush out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>electricity.</b>|$|E
5|$|In net {{metering}} {{the price of}} the electricity produced {{is the same as the}} price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard electricity meters, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>electricity</b> at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With {{net metering}}, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.|$|E
5|$|Molten salt can be {{employed}} as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant, {{so that it can}} be used <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>electricity</b> in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate. It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.|$|E

5|$|NEERC is {{expected}} to be capable of handling up to 190,000 tonnes of waste per year. This waste will be burned <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>electricity</b> for the National Grid and cogenerate to provide heat for local industries in the form of steam. NEERC will have two processing lines, capable of generating 21MW of electricity, enough to provide for 37,500 homes. This means that over the two facilities, 640,000 tonnes of waste will be burned annually, and over 50MW of electricity generated. This would make Teesside the largest operational EfW centre in the UK outside London. The plant will be a mirror image of the current one, and will create 160 jobs; 25 in South Tyne and Wear, 100 {{in the construction of the}} plant, and the rest once the plant is operational.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{interconnection}} between Sabah, the Indonesian {{province of}} North Kalimantan and the Philippine province of Palawan {{are also in}} the process as part of the BIMP-EAGA; with the interconnection with Palawan is expected to be completed in 2018. Since 2007, there is an attempt to establish a coal power plant in Lahad Datu which receiving opposition from local residents and non-governmental organisations for the pollution that would be caused by the plant. Thus Sabah has start to exploring alternative ways <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>electricity</b> with the usage of renewable energy such as solar, mini hydro, biomass, geothermal and micro-algae and tidal technologies. The Japanese government has extended aid totalling RM172,190.93 for the solar electrification project in the island of Larapan in Sabah's east coast in 2010. In 2016, Malaysia's first geothermal plant was started to be developed in Tawau to boost electricity in the east coast after a research by United States GeothermEx Inc. and Jacobs New Zealand indicated the existence of an active geothermal system centred around the flanks of Mount Maria on Apas Kiri.
