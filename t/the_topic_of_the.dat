5|$|Join Hands took <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First World War as its inspiration. Musically, it is {{darker than}} the band's debut album The Scream: it sounds more claustrophobic and more haunting. It was the last album with the band's first {{recorded}} line-up, as guitarist John McKay and drummer Kenny Morris quit the group after a disagreement {{at the beginning of}} the British Join Hands tour, on the day of the album's release.|$|E
5|$|Several critics {{noted that}} Florida sounded {{too eager to}} coin terms {{and that some of}} the pop {{cultural}} references and anecdotes were awkward. Environmental psychologist Michael Dudley pointed out copy-editing errors such as misspellings, and complained that Florida ignored existing literature on <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> connections between personalities and places. Likewise, Tom Hutton in the journal Economic Geography noted the absence of influential academics Allen Scott and Peter Hall in the text.|$|E
5|$|On 26 April 2007, Norway {{signed a}} NOK150 million joint-development {{agreement}} with Saab {{to cooperate in}} the development programme of the Gripen, including the integration of Norwegian industries {{in the development of}} future versions of the aircraft. In June of the same year, Saab also entered an agreement with Thales Norway A/S concerning the development of communications systems for the Gripen fighter. This order was the first awarded under the provisions of the Letter of Agreement signed by the Norwegian Ministry of Defence and Gripen International in April 2007. As a result of the United States diplomatic cables leak in 2010, it was revealed that US diplomats had become concerned with cooperation between Norway and Sweden on <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gripen, and had sought to exert pressure against a Norwegian purchase of the aircraft.|$|E

A new dimension of thought is that of the isolated subject of technology for trauma care as published in the World Journal of Surgery by Mihir Shah et al. Topics covered included the use of the Broselow tape as the best estimate for children's weight, green bananas as an effective treatment for diarrhea, and misoprostol as a potential alternative for postpartum hemorrhage when oxytocin is not available.|$|E
5|$|After the Deluge, {{also known}} as The Forty-First Day, is a Symbolist oil {{painting}} by English artist George Frederic Watts, first exhibited as The Sun in an incomplete form in 1886 and completed in 1891. It shows {{a scene from the}} story of Noah's Flood, in which after 40 days of rain Noah opens the window of his Ark to see that the rain has stopped. Watts felt that modern society was in decline owing to a lack of moral values, and he often painted works on <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Flood and its cleansing of the unworthy from the world. The painting {{takes the form of a}} stylised seascape, dominated by a bright sunburst breaking through clouds. Although this was a theme Watts had depicted previously in The Genius of Greek Poetry in 1878, After the Deluge took a radically different approach. With this painting he intended to evoke a monotheistic God in the act of creation, but avoid depicting the Creator directly.|$|E
5|$|In March 1996, British Aerospace {{promoted}} {{the option of}} establishing a production line to manufacture new-build Nimrod MRA4 aircraft {{as an alternative to}} the refurbishment of existing airframes, this was reportedly motivated by service concerns regarding attrition rates of the existing aircraft. It was also announced that preliminary talks had been conducted with the South African Air Force on <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nimrod 2000; British Aerospace were also considering the merits of using a newly developed variant of the General Electric CF34 turbofan powerplant, which General Electric had formally proposed the specific use of to power the type. In June 1996, British Aerospace announced that it had partnered with McDonnell Douglas to market new-build Nimrod 2000s to the export market; it has been claimed that this move was in response to scepticism from the MoD over the prospects of export sales for the type. British Aerospace argued that the Nimrod 2000's selection would give it entry to the global maritime patrol aircraft market.|$|E

5|$|Since a {{proposal}} by Butinov and Knorozov in the 1950s, {{the majority of}} philologists, linguists and cultural historians have taken the line that rongorongo was not true writing but proto-writing, that is, an ideographic- and rebus-based mnemonic device, such as the Dongba script of the Nakhi people, which would in all likelihood {{make it impossible to}} decipher. This skepticism is justified not only by the failure of the numerous attempts at decipherment, but by the extreme rarity of independent writing systems around the world. Of those who have attempted to decipher rongorongo as a true writing system, the vast majority have assumed it was logographic, a few that it was syllabic or mixed. Statistically it appears to have been compatible with neither a pure logography nor a pure syllabary. <b>The</b> <b>topic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> texts is unknown; various investigators have speculated they cover genealogy, navigation, astronomy, or agriculture. Oral history suggests that only a small elite were ever literate, and that the tablets were considered sacred.|$|E
5|$|Vainio began {{composing}} {{actively in}} the late 1970s, although he had already published his own compositions {{at the beginning of}} the decade. His earliest compositions include Matkarakastaja and Viisari värähtää. Among his most popular songs from the late 1970s is Käyn ahon laitaa ("I Walk by the Side of a Glade") from the 1979 album of the same name. Even though Vainio had already quit drinking, he still occasionally sang about alcohol. Vainio started writing more sensitive songs, a trend which became evident in his next albums. 1981's Albatrossi ja sorsa ("The Albatross and the Duck") contains one of Vainio's most well-known songs, Albatrossi. <b>The</b> <b>topic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song was lost youth. Another sensitive song on the album is Apteekin ovikello ("The Pharmacy Doorbell"), the idea for which Vainio got from Tapio Rautavaara. Other well-known songs were Panaman konsuli ("The Consul of Panama") and Kun mä rupesin ryyppäämään ("When I Started Drinking").|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} a {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} about how it was possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown. On <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University, remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain {{in a way that was}} beneficial to an individual. Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets learning disabilities, stating that among some neuroscientists {{there was a}} belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly. In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called Fast ForWord that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning disabilities in children. Feedback on Fast ForWord showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of Fast ForWord specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, Fast ForWord-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains of elderly people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.|$|E
