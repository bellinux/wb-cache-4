5|$|Augustine built {{a church}} at his {{foundation}} of Sts Peter and Paul Abbey at Canterbury, later renamed St Augustine's Abbey. <b>This</b> <b>church</b> was destroyed after the Norman Conquest {{to make way}} for a new abbey church. The mission also established Augustine's cathedral at Canterbury, which became Christ Church Priory. <b>This</b> <b>church</b> has not survived, and it is unclear if the church that was destroyed in 1067 and described by the medieval writer Eadmer as Augustine's church, was built by Augustine. Another medieval chronicler, Florence of Worcester, claimed that the priory was destroyed in 1011, and Eadmer himself had contradictory stories about the events of 1011, in one place claiming that the church was destroyed by fire and in another claiming only that it was looted. A cathedral was also established in Rochester; although the building was destroyed in 676, the bishopric continued in existence. Other church buildings were erected by the missionaries in London, York, and possibly Lincoln, although none of them survive.|$|E
5|$|Caversham Baptist {{church is}} located at the corner of South Road and Surrey Street, close to Caversham School. Unusual among Dunedin buildings, <b>this</b> <b>church</b> has a formal Classical style, with its {{brickwork}} augmented by pediments and square columns. The foundation stone for the building was laid in 1906. The former Baptist Church, in Playfair Street, is now used as a Gospel Hall.|$|E
5|$|In 597 {{the mission}} landed in Kent, and it quickly {{achieved}} some initial success: Æthelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of Canterbury, where {{they used the}} church of St. Martin's for services, and <b>this</b> <b>church</b> became {{the seat of the}} bishopric. Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of Æthelberht's conversion, but it probably took place in 597.|$|E

5|$|In {{an alley}} {{connecting}} Ragusa Ibla with Ragusa Superiore {{is the church}} of Santa Maria delle Scale. <b>This</b> <b>church</b> is interesting, though badly damaged in the earthquake. Only half the church was rebuilt in Baroque style, while the surviving half was kept in the original Norman (with Gothic features), thus demonstrating in one piece the evolution of Sicilian Baroque.|$|E
5|$|Siward {{is said to}} {{have built}} a church {{dedicated}} to St Olaf at Galmanho, York. The record of his burial in <b>this</b> <b>church</b> is the only notice of a non-royal lay burial inside a church in pre-Norman England. Siward's Howe, i.e., Heslington Hill near York, was most likely named after Earl Siward, although probably because Siward held popular courts there rather than because it was his burial place.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{tradition}} that Ine was a saint, and was the dedicatee of St Ina's Church in Llanina near New Quay, Wales. However, a more likely dedicatee for <b>this</b> <b>church</b> is the fifth-century Welsh Saint Ina.|$|E
50|$|Thomissøn's hymnal was {{the only}} hymnal allowed in Denmark-Norway after it {{received}} royal authorization. After <b>this,</b> <b>churches</b> were required to have it lying on their altars.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>church’s</b> first {{documentary}} mention {{comes from}} the 14th century. From this time also come the Gothic paintings and a mandorla that was revealed during renovation work on the tower.|$|R
50|$|Crerar's {{earliest}} recorded {{work was}} the drawing up plans for St. James' Anglican Church, Pictou in 1824. The main figure behind <b>this</b> <b>church’s</b> construction was Henry Hatton, later to be Crerar's son’s father-in-law.|$|R
5|$|According to Bulgarian National Revival enlightener Stefan Zahariev from Pazardzhik, St Demetrius was not {{the first}} church in this location. In his {{description}} of the Pazardzhik district (kaza) published in 1870, he writes that a previously existing church in roughly the same place was dedicated to Saint Pantaleon and had given its name to the village of Patalenitsa. The Church of St Pantaleon was, according to Zahariev, previously an Ancient Greek sanctuary of Asclepius. He writes that a column from <b>this</b> <b>church</b> with an inscription dedicated to Asclepius was preserved in the newer village church.|$|E
5|$|Bloet {{was one of}} {{the chief}} {{administrative}} officers of the kingdom under William II, often associated with Ranulf Flambard, Urse d'Abetot, and Haimo the dapifer. As a bishop, he moved the newly founded monastery of Stow to Eynsham instead. <b>This</b> <b>church</b> was considered a proprietary church and the bishops of Lincoln retained the right to appoint the abbot and installing the abbot in office. The monks of Stow had been established by his predecessor. Bloet also gave the manor of Charleton to the priory of Bermondsey, which became a Cluniac priory during Rufus' reign.|$|E
5|$|Deckham's other {{church is}} the Emmanuel Pentecostal Church, a plain, stone {{building}} {{located in a}} prominent position {{on the corner of}} Caris Street and Old Durham Road. Little is documented regarding <b>this</b> <b>church,</b> and the date of building is difficult to ascertain, though the Pentecostal movement in Britain dates to 1907 and the church was certified for the solomnising of marriages as recently as 21 October 1959. The Church {{is a member of the}} Assembly of God denomination of Pentecostalism and hold weekly Sunday worship, a prayer service on Mondays and a children's group on Wednesdays.|$|E

5|$|In 1172, the new pope, Alexander III, further {{encouraged}} Henry {{to advance}} {{the integration of the}} Irish Church with Rome. Henry was authorised to impose a tithe of one penny per hearth as an annual contribution. <b>This</b> <b>church</b> levy, called Peter's Pence, is extant in Ireland as a voluntary donation. In turn, Henry accepted the title of Lord of Ireland which Henry conferred on his younger son, John Lackland, in 1185. This defined the Irish state as the Lordship of Ireland. When Henry's successor died unexpectedly in 1199, John inherited the crown of England and retained the Lordship of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In 1736, a ferry {{began to}} operate, {{traveling}} from Shawnee between Shawnee Island and Depuy Island, then across the Delaware River to New Jersey. By 1740 Aaron Depuy was operating a store, and in 1753 {{he built a}} stone and log church used by ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church. The cornerstone of <b>this</b> <b>church</b> remains, {{now part of the}} Shawnee Presbyterian Church. The farming community grew steadily, using the river to transport produce. A post office was built in 1843, and a brick church was erected in 1853 on the foundation of the old stone and log church. Some of the original beams still remain, as well as the original sounding board.|$|E
5|$|In 907 Chester was refortified {{against the}} threat from the Vikings, and shortly {{afterwards}} the minster was founded or refounded, and Werburgh's remains were transferred there from Hanbury, probably by Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians. The collegiate church, as it was then, was restored in 1057 by Leofric, Earl of Mercia and Lady Godiva. <b>This</b> <b>church</b> was razed to the ground around 1090, with the secular canons evicted, and no known trace of it remains.|$|E
50|$|Meniko (Μένικο) is {{a village}} in the Nicosia District of Cyprus. Located in {{the centre of the}} town is the Greek Orthodox church, {{dedicated}} to the martyrs St Kyprianos and St Youstina. The community celebrates <b>this</b> <b>church's</b> Feast Day yearly on 2 October.|$|R

25|$|The {{regionally}} notable Kaliningrad Puppet Theater {{has had its}} seat since 1975 in the Queen Louise Remembrance <b>Church.</b> <b>This</b> neo-romantic <b>church,</b> {{designed by}} architect Fritz Heitmann, was built in 1901.|$|R
5|$|Massive {{resources}} {{were required to}} construct Castle Rising, which included three baileys with large earthwork defences and a stone keep, with an adjacent deer park just behind the castle. As part of the project, the existing settlement was moved away to the north, where it became a planned settlement adjacent to the new castle. A pre-existing Norman chapel on the site, built around 1100, was encircled by the castle defences, and the new parish church of St Lawrence {{was built in the}} town instead, although it is possible that <b>this</b> <b>church</b> also pre-dates the castle. William received permission from King Stephen to open a mint at the castle in 1145 and, probably linked to this development, settled a community of Jews in the town.|$|E
5|$|Ragusa Ibla, {{the lower}} city, boasts an {{impressive}} array of Baroque architecture, which includes the Church of San Giorgio by Rosario Gagliardi, designed in 1738 (Illustration 12). In the design of <b>this</b> <b>church</b> Gagliardi exploited the difficult terrain of the hillside site. The church towers impressively over a massive marble staircase of some 250 steps, a Baroque feature, especially exploited in Sicily due to the island's topography. The tower seems to explode from the façade, accentuated by the columns and pilasters canted against the curved walls. Above the doorways and window apertures, pediments scroll and curve with a sense of freedom and movement which would have been unthinkable to those earlier architects inspired by Bernini and Borromini. The neoclassical dome was not added until 1820.|$|E
5|$|The Evangelical Missionary Church of Besançon (French: Église évangélique missionnaire de Besançon), {{formerly}} known as the Evangelical Pentecostal Church of Besançon and The Mission, is a Christian movement established in Besançon, France, in December1963. In close communion with the Protestant Federation of France, <b>this</b> <b>church</b> belongs to the Pentecostal movement and in 1969 founded the Evangelical Missionary Federation (Fédération Évangélique Missionnaire, or FEM) to gather the various Pentecostal churches it created. The assemblies, which developed very quickly throughout eastern and northern France, numbered well over 2,000 members.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{remains of}} a building on the site are of a late-Roman mausoleum, identified during excavations in 1980. An abbey church was built in Wells in 705 by Aldhelm, first bishop of the newly established Diocese of Sherborne {{during the reign of}} King Ine of Wessex. It was dedicated to Saint Andrew and stood {{at the site of the}} cathedral's cloisters, where some excavated remains can be seen. The font in the cathedral's south transept is from <b>this</b> <b>church</b> and is the oldest part of the present building. In 766 Cynewulf, King of Wessex, signed a charter endowing the church with eleven hides of land. In 909 the seat of the diocese was moved from Sherborne to Wells.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{surviving}} {{church building}} in the town is Orrick Chapel, built between 1866 and 1869 {{as the home of}} an African Methodist Episcopal congregation. Missionaries from this first independent black denomination came South after the war to aid freedmen and plant new congregations; they attracted hundreds of thousands of new members. <b>This</b> <b>church</b> replaced an earlier Methodist chapel constructed in the late 1850s; it was razed by Union troops during the winter months of 1864–1865 {{near the end of the}} Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The rector of <b>this</b> <b>Church</b> of England parish as of 2011 is the Rev Neil Batcock. The {{benefice}} rotates {{its services}} among its five constituent churches, with typically five services in total on Sundays, and two mid-week Holy Communions. As with most Anglican churches in England, the congregation is mainly elderly, {{although there are}} monthly family services focussed on children. There is also a monthly laying on of hands for healing, and sometimes other variants from the standard format involving music or Taizé-influenced worship. The parish accepts the diocese's guidance on permitting baptism and marriage in church after a divorce, and claims {{to work closely with}} its Catholic and Methodist neighbours.|$|E
