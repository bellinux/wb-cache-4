5|$|As Tyrion and Bronn head towards Tywin Lannister's camp, {{they are}} {{surrounded}} {{by one of the}} barbarian hill tribes of the Vale. Tyrion convinces them to serve as his escorts by promising them gold, weapons and an army to help them seize the Vale of Arryn. Tywin is displeased, but agrees to keep Tyrion's promises if the hill tribes join the fight against the Starks. The tribesmen agree, but want Tyrion <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>them</b> as insurance, much to Tyrion's discomfort.|$|E
5|$|The Royalist expeditionary navy {{that would}} raid San Lorenzo {{comprised}} eleven ships of varying sizes, {{two hundred and}} fifty soldiers and fifty sailors. They moved into the Paraná through its tributary, the Paraná Guazú River, slowed down by headwinds. The Second Triumvirate promoted José de San Martín to colonel and instructed him <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>them</b> with the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers and stop the raids. San Martín was influenced by Napoleonic warfare and trained the regiment with the most recent military techniques used in the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E

5|$|The tear streaks are a {{means of}} visual communication. The tear streaks {{combined}} with the black lips and the contrasting white fur give the face a striking appearance and form clear expressions when viewed from a close range. The ears and the face are obscure from a distance, {{and so are the}} expressions. On the other hand, the tail is quite conspicuous and is probably used by mothers to direct juveniles <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|When the French and Indian War {{began in}} 1754 {{as part of}} the Seven Years' War, Franklin {{recruited}} militias. During the war, the city attracted many refugees from the western frontier. When Pontiac's Rebellion occurred in 1763, refugees again fled into the city, including a group of Lenape hiding from other Native Americans, angry at their pacifism, and white frontiersmen. The Paxton Boys tried <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>them</b> into Philadelphia for attacks, but was prevented by the city's militia and Franklin, who convinced them to leave.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite and Nettles sent {{advertisements}} {{to groups}} in California and {{were invited to}} speak to New Age devotees there in April 1975. At this meeting, they persuaded {{about half of the}} 50 attendees <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>them.</b> They also focused on college campuses, speaking at Cañada College in August. At a meeting in Oregon in September 1975, they saw further recruitment success—about 30 people left their homes to follow the pair, prompting interest from media outlets. The coverage was negative: commentators and some former members mocked the group and leveled accusations of brainwashing against Applewhite and Nettles. Balch and Taylor state that Applewhite and Nettles eschewed pressure tactics, seeking only devoted followers.|$|E

5|$|At {{first the}} Dutch were winning the action, but after {{they put in}} {{disorder}} two or three Spanish squadrons, Paulo Emilio Martinengo charged ahead his company on their flank and in turn routed a Dutch squadron, which allowed Córdoba to regroup his troops and renew the attack, this time with success. Despite the stubborn resistance offered by the Dutch troops, they were finally broken and fled in a disorderly fashion, attempting to save themselves before the Lippe river. Córdoba sent his cavalry <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>them</b> up, and they found {{that some of the}} Dutch soldiers, having been unable to find a good place to ford the river, had drowned. The Spanish captives were freed, and the spoils taken by the Dutch recovered.|$|E

As the wights close in, a black-clad rider appears and destroys some of the wights while pulling Meera and Bran onto his horse, allowing them to escape.|$|E
5|$|Government {{among the}} Yavapai {{tended to be}} informal. There were no tribal chiefs, such as Chief of the Guwevkabaya or Chief of the Ɖo:lkabaya. Certain men became {{recognized}} leaders based on others choosing <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>them,</b> heed their advice, and support their decisions. Men who were noted for their skills as warriors were called mastava (″not afraid″) or bamulva (″person who goes forward″). Other warriors were willing to follow such men into combat. Some Yavapai men were noted for their wisdom and speaking ability. Called bakwauu (″person who talks″), they would settle disputes within the camp and advise others on the selection of campsites, work ethics, and food production.|$|E

5|$|Grameen Bank is {{best known}} for its system of {{solidarity}} lending. The Bank also incorporates a set of values embodied in Bangladesh by the Sixteen Decisions. At every branch of Grameen Bank, the borrowers recite these Decisions and vow <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>them.</b> As a result of the Sixteen Decisions, Grameen borrowers have been encouraged to adopt positive social habits. One such habit includes educating children by sending them to school. Since the Grameen Bank embraced the Sixteen Decisions, almost all Grameen borrowers have their school-age children enrolled in regular classes. This in turn helps bring about social change, and educate the next generation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventh}} stage to Bordeaux, Trousselier {{punctured}} {{after only a}} few kilometers. The rest of the cyclists quickly sped away from him, and Trousselier had <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>them</b> alone for 200km. A few kilometers before Bordeaux, Trousselier caught up with the rest, and even managed to win the sprint. Louis Trousselier kept his lead {{until the end of the}} race, winning five stages. Trousselier was accused of bad sportsmanship: he reportedly smashed the inkstands of a control post to prevent his opponents from signing. Unlike the 1904 Tour de France, no stage winners, nor anyone from the top ten of the general classification, were disqualified.|$|E

His governorship {{was the first in}} which no state executions took place, due to his opposition to capital punishment and his practice of pardoning and commuting the sentences of people condemned to execution. He regularly attacked corporations and used recently created anti-trust laws to attempt to break several large businesses. He participated in a number of ceremonial events, including personally laying the final golden brick to complete the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1909.|$|E

5|$|On 19 July, {{reconnaissance}} aircraft located a Turkish {{force in the}} desert moving west. The regiment and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade were ordered to establish a line of observation posts in their path. They were to send out patrols to locate them, but withdraw if attacked. If possible, they were to retire towards Romani, enticing the Turks <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>them.</b> At dawn on 20 July the regiment located the Turks digging trenches near Ogratina. Rifle fire was exchanged and some prisoners were captured. The prisoners revealed that the force comprised twelve battalions with artillery support, planning to attack Romani.|$|E
5|$|Overnight, the 1st and 3rd Parachute battalions had skirted as {{far south}} as 2nd Parachute Battalion's {{original}} route into the city, hoping <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>them</b> into Arnhem centre. They approached the German line before light and for several hours attempted to fight through the German positions. Spindler's force—being continually reinforced—was too strong to penetrate, and by 10:00 the British advance was stopped. A more coordinated attack followed in the afternoon, but it too was repulsed. Urquhart attempted to return to his Divisional Headquarters at Oosterbeek but became cut off and was forced to take shelter in a Dutch family's loft with two fellow officers. Lathbury was injured and also forced into hiding.|$|E
5|$|The city {{severely}} {{suffered from}} the Great Turkish War {{at the end of}} the 17th century and consequently experienced recession until the 19th century. In 1689, Austrians seized Skopje which was already weakened by a cholera epidemic. The same day, general Silvio Piccolomini set fire to the city to end the epidemic. It is however possible that he wanted to avenge damages that Turks caused in Vienna in 1683. Skopje burned during two days. The Austrian presence in Macedonia motivated Slav uprisings. Nevertheless, Austrians left the country within the year and Hajduks, leaders of the uprisings, had <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>them</b> in their retreat north of the Balkans. Some were arrested by the Turks, such as Petar Karposh, who was impaled on Skopje Stone Bridge.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the rest}} of August, they {{continued}} offensive operations, even launching daylight raids upon the German positions. On 22 August they attacked once more, advancing through the village of Bray, capturing a number of German prisoners. After a brief lull in the fighting, they continued the advance again on 25 August capturing Clery {{at the end of}} the week before taking Allaines on 2 September. Throughout September the Germans began to withdraw back towards the Hindenburg Line and the 3rd Division took part in the operations undertaken <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>them</b> up and harass the rearguard. Casualties during this phase had been high, however, and as a result the division's pioneers were used as infantry and even led the advance towards Buire on 6 September.|$|E
5|$|After {{the opera}} became {{successful}} in London, Richard D'Oyly Carte quickly sent touring companies into the British provinces. At least one D'Oyly Carte company, and sometimes {{as many as}} three, played Pinafore under Carte's aegis every year between 1878 and 1888, including its first London revival in 1887. The opera was then given a rest, returning to the touring repertory between 1894 and 1900 and again {{for most of the}} time between 1903 and 1940. Gilbert directed all the revivals during his lifetime, and after his death, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company had exclusive performing rights to the Savoy operas until 1962. It continued to hew closely to Gilbert's directions throughout that period, as recorded in Gilbert's prompt books, and it also required its licensees <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>them</b> closely.|$|E
