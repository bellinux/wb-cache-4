50|$|The {{official}} coin <b>toss</b> {{was moved}} to three minutes before kickoff.

40|$|In {{this student}} project {{it was to}} be {{experimentally}} figured out how fair a fair coin behaves. To achieve this, fair coin <b>tosses</b> with a different number of maximum coin <b>tosses</b> were simulated and it was analyzed how often chains of given lengths of ones/zeros (assumed to be heads/tails) appear and how much more often zeros appear per experiment compared to ones. This maximum number was - 10 <b>tosses</b> per experiment - 100 <b>tosses</b> per experiment - 1. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment - 10. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment - 100. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment - 1. 000. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment - 10. 000. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment - 100. 000. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment - 1. 000. 000. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment - 10. 000. 000. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment Except for the last three, all experiments were repeated 1. 000 times. The 100. 000. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment was repeated 100 times, the 1. 000. 000. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment was repeated 10 times and the 10. 000. 000. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment was NOT repeated. For these one/zero chain distributions the fitting parameters were determined, assuming a geometrical distribution. The experiments with up to 100. 000. 000 <b>tosses</b> per experiment were repeated with an UNFAIR coin, using a Maxwell Boltzmann statistic for the distribution of coin <b>tosses.</b> [...] In the data-folder these experiments are divided into the normal distributed and Maxwell-Boltzmann distributed coin <b>toss</b> experiments. These two folders contain the folders with the data for the different maximum number of coin <b>tosses</b> per experiment. Each of these folders contains two subfolders which contain the distributions of the respective chains of ones or zeros (heads or tails). In this folder (NOT the subfolders!) in addition can be found: - a file with the fitting parameters for each heads/tails-chain-distribution, - a file with an analysis of these fitting parameters, - a file in which it is analyzed how much more often zero {{was the result of the}} <b>toss</b> (for one experiment) - a file with an analysis of that, - and two files in which the chain-distributions are summed up. The result for each coin <b>toss</b> in each experiment were NOT saved. For the Maxwell Boltzmann distributed coin <b>tosses</b> also the distribution itself was saved for each experiment and can be found in the respective subfolder. [...] In the scripts folder, all the programs can be found that were created to create and analyze all the data.

The game has been a successful release and was first introduced at New York Toy Fair.|$|R
25|$|For example, in {{a series}} of coin <b>tosses,</b> a {{perfectly}} ordered system would be one in which either every <b>toss</b> comes up heads or every <b>toss</b> comes up tails. This means that for a perfectly ordered set of coin <b>tosses,</b> there is only one set of <b>toss</b> outcomes possible: the set in which 100% of <b>tosses</b> come up the same. On the other hand, there are multiple combinations that can result in disordered or mixed systems, where some fraction are heads and the rest tails. A disordered system can be 90% heads and 10% tails, or it could be 98% heads and 2% tails, et cetera. As the number of coin <b>tosses</b> increases, the number of possible combinations corresponding to imperfectly ordered systems increases. For {{a very large number of}} coin <b>tosses,</b> the combinations to ~50% heads and ~50% tails dominates and obtaining an outcome significantly different from 50/50 becomes extremely unlikely. Thus the system naturally progresses to a state of maximum disorder or entropy.|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} a Last Ride match between The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy, {{where the only}} way to win was by throwing one's opponent into a hearse and driving it out of the arena. During the beginning of the match, The Undertaker <b>tossed</b> Kennedy into steel steps {{on the side of the}} ring and then onto the commentator's announcing table. The Undertaker then threw Kennedy into the ring apron, which is the apron covering the area under the ring. Kennedy and The Undertaker wrestled inconclusively until The Undertaker <b>tossed</b> Kennedy on top of the roof of the hearse. The Undertaker then delivered a Chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver, both onto the roof of the hearse. As he was still in control of the match, The Undertaker threw Kennedy into the hearse and drove it out of the arena to win the match.|$|E

But in truth, each coin <b>toss</b> sequence was programmed ahead of time to ensure that all participants would encounter the same coin <b>toss</b> sequences.|$|R

School buses were there for an early dismissal due to the storms at just after 1:00pm, but the tornado hit before the school could be dismissed.|$|E

5|$|Farther to the {{northeast}} in Fayette County, Tennessee, another powerful tornado touched down near the rural community of Yum Yum and quickly reached EF3 intensity. This tornado was spawned by the same supercell that had affected Memphis about an hour earlier. Near {{the beginning of the}} path, a shed was obliterated and a pickup truck parked inside was thrown 40 feet and mangled, killing a man inside the vehicle. Several other vehicles were <b>tossed,</b> and significant damage to large trees was observed before the tornado crossed into Haywood County. Weakening to EF2 strength, the tornado struck the town of Dancyville, destroying a house, severely damaging another house and a church, and uprooting numerous large trees. The tornado then struck the rural community of Hillville, where two mobile homes were completely destroyed, a frame home was heavily damaged, and a convenience store sustained roof damage. Numerous large trees in this area were snapped, and an outbuilding was flattened. Several other homes along this segment of the path sustained minor damage. Regaining EF3 strength, the tornado crossed into Madison County, striking the Huntersville community. Numerous homes were damaged or destroyed in Huntersville, and two people were killed. A church in town sustained major damage, and a nearby church bus was <b>tossed</b> several hundred feet and flipped upside down. The tornado then exited Huntersville and headed towards the city of Jackson. Several cars and at least 13 tractor trailers were blown off of Interstate 40 by the tornado in this area. One car was <b>tossed</b> 75 yards into a farm field. A rest area along the interstate was severely damaged before the tornado began to weaken and lifted as it approached U.S. Route 412, dissipating just before it would have entered densely populated areas of western and northern Jackson.|$|E
