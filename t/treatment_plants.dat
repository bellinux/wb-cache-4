5|$|The {{municipality}} {{aims for}} a coherent and holistic {{administration of the}} water cycle to protect against or clean up previous pollution and encourage green growth and self-sufficiency. The main issues are excessive nutrients, adapting to increasing levels of precipitation brought on by climate change, and securing the water supply. These goals have manifested {{in a number of}} large water treatment projects often in collaboration with private partners. In the 2000s, underground rainwater basins were built across the city while the two lakes Årslev Engsø and Egå Engsø were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively. The number of sewage <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> is planned to be reduced from 17 to 2 by 2025 as the <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> in Marselisborg and Egå are scheduled for expansion to take over all waste water treatment. They have already been refitted for biogas production to become net producers of electricity and heat. To aid the new <b>treatment</b> <b>plants,</b> and avoid floodings, sewage and stormwater throughout the municipality is planned to be separated into two different drainage systems. Construction began in 2017 in several areas, but it is a long process and is scheduled to be finished by 2085.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{improved}} sanitation is also universal, either through sewers or on-site sanitation. All collected waste water is treated at secondary-level <b>treatment</b> <b>plants.</b> All effluents discharged to closed or semi-closed water bodies, such as Tokyo Bay, Osaka Bay, or Lake Biwa, are further treated to tertiary level. This applies to about 15% of waste water. The effluent quality is remarkably good at 3–10mg/l of BOD for secondary-level treatment, {{well below the}} national effluent standard of 20mg/l.|$|E

5|$|The {{physical}} {{impacts of}} ashfall {{can affect the}} operation of water <b>treatment</b> <b>plants.</b> Ash can block intake structures, cause severe abrasion damage to pump impellers and overload pump motors. Many water <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> have an initial coagulation/flocculation step that is automatically adjusted to turbidity (the level of suspended solids, measured in nephelometric turbidity units) in the incoming water. In most cases, changes in turbidity caused by suspended ash particles will be within the normal operating range of the plant and can be managed satisfactorily by adjusting the addition of coagulant. Ashfalls {{will be more likely}} to cause problems for plants that are not designed for high levels of turbidity and which may omit coagulation/flocculation treatment. Ash can enter filtration systems such as open sand filters both by direct fallout and via intake waters. In most cases, increased maintenance will be required to manage the effects of an ashfall, but there will not be service interruptions.|$|E

50|$|In {{the postwar}} years Canadian {{municipalities}} began treating raw sewage, which {{up to that}} time, with a few notable exceptions, {{had been allowed to}} flow directly from their sewer systems into nearby streams, rivers, lakes and oceans. New facilities were added in Toronto including the Highland Creek Wastewater <b>Treatment</b> <b>Plant</b> in 1956 and the Humber Wastewater <b>Treatment</b> <b>Plant</b> in 1960. Vancouver built a number of sewage treatment facilities including the Lions Gate Wastewater <b>Treatment</b> <b>Plant</b> in 1961, the Iona Island Wastewater <b>Treatment</b> <b>Plant</b> in 1963 and the Lulu Island Wastewater <b>Treatment</b> <b>Plant</b> in 1973. The City of Ottawa built the Green's Creek Pollution Control Center (now Robert O. Pickard Environmental Centre) in 1961. In 1970 the City of Montreal began the construction of a large sewer network which channeled all effluent to the <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> at Rivière-des-Prairies on the east end of the island and became operational in 1996. By 1980, 64% of Canadians were served by sewage treatment, with the figure rising to 78% in 1997.|$|R
5|$|X. bracteatum {{is easy to}} grow {{both from}} seeds and from cuttings, {{although}} named cultivars only grow true from cuttings. Plants benefit from pruning of old growth in winter to allow for new growth in spring. Dead-heading, or pruning off old flower heads, promotes the production of more flowers. Fresh seeds germinate in 3 to 20days and require no special <b>treatment.</b> <b>Plants</b> grow best in acid, well-aerated soils of pH5.5 to 6.3, {{with low levels of}} phosphorus. They are sensitive to iron deficiency, which presents as yellowing (chlorosis) of the youngest leaves while the leaf veins remain green.|$|E
5|$|Hyderabad {{produces}} around 4,500tonnes {{of solid}} waste daily, which is transported from collection units in Imlibun, Yousufguda and Lower Tank Bund to the dumpsite in Jawaharnagar. Disposal is managed by the Integrated Solid Waste Management project which was started by the GHMC in 2010. Rapid urbanisation and increased economic activity has also led to increased industrial waste, air, noise and water pollution, which is regulated by the Telangana Pollution Control Board (TPCB). The contribution of different sources to air pollution in 2006 was: 20–50% from vehicles, 40–70% {{from a combination of}} vehicle discharge and road dust, 10–30% from industrial discharges and 3–10% from the burning of household rubbish. Deaths resulting from atmospheric particulate matter are estimated at 1,700–3,000 each year. Ground water around Hyderabad, which has a hardness of up to 1000 ppm, around three times higher than is desirable, is the main source of drinking water but the increasing population and consequent increase in demand has led to a decline in not only ground water but also river and lake levels. This shortage is further exacerbated by inadequately treated effluent discharged from industrial <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> polluting the water sources of the city.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} Winifred's approach, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) issued cyclone watches and {{warnings}} for various locations along the Queensland coast, prompting evacuations in several towns. Damage after landfall was widespread and severe, {{with thousands of}} homes damaged, flooding {{as a result of}} heavy rainfall along major rivers, and severe damage to crops. Debris obstructed roads across northern Queensland and power outages disrupted electrical service, even at water <b>treatment</b> <b>plants,</b> forcing officials to warn residents to boil water as a precautionary measure. Overall, the cyclone caused $86.4million in agriculture-related damages, with sugar cane and banana harvests suffering the most. Tourist operations were generally uninterrupted by the storm, while ecological and environmental damage, if any, was mild. Even so, high winds uprooted trees in wide swaths of forests, with those not completely defoliated. Overall, Winifred caused three deaths and inflicted $130million (1986AUD; $154million USD) in damage.|$|E

5|$|In {{the western}} Mojave Desert, human {{settlement}} and land development {{have led to}} an estimated 16-fold increase in the common raven population over 25 years. Towns, landfills, sewage <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> and artificial ponds create sources {{of food and water}} for scavenging birds. Ravens also find nesting sites in utility poles and ornamental trees, and are attracted to roadkill on highways. The explosion in the common raven population in the Mojave has raised concerns for the desert tortoise, a threatened species. Common ravens prey upon juvenile tortoises, which have soft shells and move slowly. Despite this, and there being no danger of extinction, the US Congress added ravens to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in 1971. Plans to control the population have included shooting and trapping birds, as well as contacting landfill operators to ask that they reduce the amount of exposed garbage. A hunting bounty as a method of control was historically used in Finland from the mid-18th century until 1923. Culling has taken place to a limited extent in Alaska, where the population increase in common ravens is threatening the vulnerable Steller's eider (Polysticta stelleri).|$|E
