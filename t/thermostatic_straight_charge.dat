Transmission tower is {{taken into account}} by using a simplified frame. Segments of tower frame are represented by finite <b>straight</b> line <b>charges.</b> Overhead lines with conductor sag determined by catenary equation are also represented by finite <b>straight</b> line <b>charges.</b> Calculation results show that transmission tower has shielding effect on closed region and distortion effect nearby tower leg...|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} a {{constant}} rise in an army's rate of fire for the last 700 years or so, but while massed charges have been successfully broken they have also been victorious. It is only since the late 19th century that <b>straight</b> <b>charges</b> have become less successful, especially since the introduction of the machine gun and breech-loading artillery. They are often still useful on a far smaller scale in confined areas where the enemy's firepower cannot be brought to bear.|$|R

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} momentum {{conservation equation}} for a straight jet {{driven by an}} electrical field is developed. It is presented {{in terms of a}} stress component, which can be applied to any constitutive relation of fluids. The only assumption is that the fluid is incompressible. The results indicate that both the axial and radial constitutive relations are required to close the governing equations of the <b>straight</b> <b>charged</b> jet. However, when the trace of the extra stress tensor is zero, only the axial constitutive relation is required. It is also found that the second normal stress difference for the charged jet is always zero. The comparison with other developed momentum equations is made. Department of Applied Mathematic...|$|R

40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [51305373, 51305371]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China [2013 J 05083]This paper {{studies the}} {{whipping}} deposition behavior of <b>straight</b> <b>charged</b> jets of Near-Field Electrospinning. A micro 3 D structure of multi-loop nanofibrous coil was printed on a silicon collector. The whipping motion resulted from Coulomb force caused the charged jet to deposit {{and form a}} coiled structure. With the guidance of deposited nanofiber, the charged jet deposited layer by layer {{to build up a}} 3 D nanofibrous coiled structure with 3 - 50 loops. The diameter of the coiled structure ranged from 4 to 60 mu m. The number of loops decreased with the increase of collector motion speed, due to shorter post-deposition relaxing time. With higher stress inside the charged jet, PEO solution of higher concentration led to fewer loops but larger diameter of the coil. This work provides a promising method to study the control technology of charged jet printing, which may push forward the development of micro 3 D inkjet printing technology...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} study of detonation propagation in unconfined explosive charges shaped as an annular arc (rib). Steady detonation in a <b>straight</b> <b>charge</b> propagates at constant speed {{but when it}} enters an annular section, it goes through a transition phase and eventually reaches a new steady state of constant angular velocity. This study examines {{the speed of the}} detonation wave along the annular charge during the transition phase and at steady state, as well as its dependence on the dimensions of the annulus. The system is modeled using a recently proposed diffuse-interface formulation which allows for the representation of a two-phase explosive and of an additional inert material. The explosive considered is the polymer-bonded TATB-based LX- 17 and is modeled using two JWL equations of state and the Ignition and Growth reaction rate law. Results show that steady state speeds are in good agreement with experiment. In the transition phase, the evolution of outer detonation speed deviates from the exponential bounded growth function suggested by previous studies. We propose a new description of the transition phase which consists of two regimes. The first is caused by local effects at {{the outer edge of the}} annulus and leads to a dependence of outer detonation speed on angular position along the arc. The second regime is induced by effects originating from the inner edge of the annular charge and leads to the deceleration of the outer detonation until steady state is reached. The study concludes with a parametric study where the dependence of the steady state and the transition phase on the dimensions of the annulus is investigated...|$|R

40|$|Prototype of Linac 2, a Linear proton {{accelerator}} {{used in the}} PS (proton synchrotron accelerator injection system). A Linearaccelerator is a particle accelerator which accelerates charged particles - electrons, protons or heavy ions - in a <b>straight</b> line. <b>Charged</b> particles enter {{at one end and}} are accelerated towards the first drift tube by an electric field. Once inside the drift tube, they are shielded from the field and drift through at a constant velocity. When they arrive at the next gap, the field accelerates them again until they reach the next drift tube. This continues, with the particles picking up more and more energy in each gap, until they shoot out of the accelerator at the other end. Linac 2,also called Alvarez Proton Linac, was first run in 1978 and is still running today. It provides pulsed (1 Hz) beams of up to 170 mA at 50 MeV with pulse lengths varying between 20 and 150 ms depending on the number of protons required...|$|R
