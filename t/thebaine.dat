25|$|The {{production}} of opium {{has not changed}} since ancient times. Through selective breeding of the Papaver somniferum plant, {{the content of the}} phenanthrene alkaloids morphine, codeine, {{and to a lesser extent}} <b>thebaine</b> has been greatly increased. In modern times, much of the <b>thebaine,</b> which often serves as the raw material for the synthesis for hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and other semisynthetic opiates, originates from extracting Papaver orientale or Papaver bracteatum.|$|E
25|$|It was {{announced}} in 1973 that a team at the National Institutes of Health in the United States had developed a method for total synthesis of morphine, codeine, and <b>thebaine</b> using coal tar as a starting material. A shortage in codeine-hydrocodone class cough suppressants (all {{of which can be}} made from morphine in one or more steps, as well as from codeine or <b>thebaine)</b> was the initial reason for the research.|$|E
25|$|Dihydrocodeine is {{the parent}} drug {{of a series}} of {{moderately}} strong narcotics including, among others, hydrocodone, nicocodeine, nicodicodeine, <b>thebaine</b> and acetyldihydrocodeine.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is {{the most}} {{abundant}} opiate found in opium, the dried latex extracted by shallowly scoring the unripe seedpods of the Papaver somniferum poppy. Morphine is generally 8–14% of the dry weight of opium, although specially bred cultivars reach 26% or produce little morphine at all (under 1%, perhaps down to 0.04%). The latter varieties, including the 'Przemko' and 'Norman' cultivars of the opium poppy, are used to produce two other alkaloids, <b>thebaine</b> and oripavine, which {{are used in the}} manufacture of semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids like oxycodone and etorphine and some other types of drugs. P. bracteatum does not contain morphine or codeine, or other narcotic phenanthrene-type, alkaloids. This species is rather a source of <b>thebaine.</b> Occurrence of morphine in other Papaverales and Papaveraceae, as well as in some species of hops and mulberry trees has not been confirmed. Morphine is produced most predominantly early in the life cycle of the plant. Past the optimum point for extraction, various processes in the plant produce codeine, <b>thebaine,</b> and in some cases negligible amounts of hydromorphone, dihydromorphine, dihydrocodeine, tetrahydro-thebaine, and hydrocodone (these compounds are rather synthesized from <b>thebaine</b> and oripavine).|$|E
25|$|Buprenorphine is a semi-synthetic {{analogue}} of <b>thebaine</b> and {{is fairly}} soluble in water, as its hydrochloride salt. It degrades {{in the presence}} of light.|$|E
25|$|Drugs bearing {{resemblance}} to codeine in effects due to close structural relationship are {{variations on the}} methyl groups at the 3 position including ethylmorphine a.k.a. codethyline (Dionine) and benzylmorphine (Peronine). While having no narcotic effects of its own, the important opioid precursor <b>thebaine</b> differs from codeine only slightly in structure. Pseudocodeine and some other similar alkaloids not currently used in medicine are found in trace amounts in opium as well.|$|E
25|$|Natural opiates: {{alkaloids}} {{contained in}} the resin of the opium poppy, primarily morphine, codeine, and <b>thebaine,</b> but not papaverine and noscapine which have a different mechanism of action; The following could be considered natural opiates: The leaves from Mitragyna speciosa (also known as kratom) contain a few naturally-occurring opioids, active via Mu- and Delta receptors. Salvinorin A, found naturally in the Salvia divinorum plant, is a kappa-opioid receptor agonist.|$|E
25|$|L-tyrosine → para-tyramine or L-DOPA → {{dopamine}} → (S)-norlaudanosoline → (S)-reticuline → 1,2-dehydroretinulinium → (R)-reticuline → salutaridine → salutaridinol → <b>thebaine</b> → neopinone → codeinone → codeine → morphine (S)-Norlaudanosoline (also {{known as}} tetrahydropapaveroline) {{can also be}} synthesized from 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), a metabolite of L-DOPA and dopamine. Urinary concentrations of endogenous codeine and morphine {{have been found to}} significantly increase in individuals taking L-DOPA for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
25|$|Freund and Speyer of the University of Frankfurt in Germany first {{synthesized}} oxycodone from <b>Thebaine</b> in 1916, a {{few years}} after the German pharmaceutical company Bayer had stopped the mass production of heroin due to hazardous use, harmful use, and dependence. It was hoped that a thebaine-derived drug would retain the analgesic effects of morphine and heroin with less dependence. Unfortunately, this was ultimately not found to be the case.|$|E
25|$|Oxycodone is a semisynthetic opioid {{synthesized}} from <b>thebaine,</b> an opioid alkaloid {{found in}} the Persian poppy, {{and one of the}} many alkaloids {{found in the}} opium poppy. It is a moderately potent opioid analgesic (orally roughly 1.5 to 3 times more potent than morphine), generally indicated for relief of moderate to severe pain. Oxycodone was developed in 1917 in Germany as one of several semi-synthetic opioids in an attempt to improve on the existing opioids.|$|E
25|$|Most of the licit {{morphine}} produced {{is used to}} make codeine by methylation. It is also {{a precursor}} for many drugs including heroin (3,6-diacetylmorphine), hydromorphone (dihydromorphinone), and oxymorphone (14-hydroxydihydromorphinone); many morphine derivatives can also be manufactured using <b>thebaine</b> or codeine as a starting material. Replacement of the N-methyl group of morphine with an N-phenylethyl group results in a product that is 18 times more powerful than morphine in its opiate agonist potency. Combining this modification with {{the replacement of the}} 6-hydroxyl with a 6-methylene group produces a compound some 1,443 times more potent than morphine, stronger than the Bentley compounds such as etorphine (M99, the Immobilon tranquilliser dart) by some measures.|$|E
25|$|Opium {{contains}} two main groups of alkaloids. Phenanthrenes such as morphine, codeine, and <b>thebaine</b> {{are the main}} psychoactive constituents. Isoquinolines such as papaverine and noscapine have no significant central nervous system effects, and are not regulated under the Controlled Substances Act. Morphine is the most prevalent and important alkaloid in opium, consisting of 10–16 percent of the total, and is {{responsible for most of}} its harmful effects such as lung edema, respiratory difficulties, coma, or cardiac or respiratory collapse. Morphine binds to and activates mu opioid receptor in the brain, spinal cord, stomach and intestine. Regular use can lead to drug tolerance or physical dependence. Chronic opium addicts in 1906 China or modern-day Iran consume an average of eight grams of opium daily.|$|E
25|$|Opium poppy {{contains}} {{at least}} 50 different alkaloids, {{but most of}} them are of very low concentration. Morphine is the principal alkaloid in raw opium and constitutes roughly 8–19% of opium by dry weight (depending on growing conditions). Some purpose-developed strains of poppy now produce opium that is up to 26% morphine by weight. A rough rule of thumb to determine the morphine content of pulverised dried poppy straw is to divide the percentage expected for the strain or crop via the latex method by eight or an empirically determined factor, which is often in the range of 5 to 15. The Norman strain of P. Somniferum, also developed in Tasmania, produces down to 0.04% morphine but with much higher amounts of <b>thebaine</b> and oripavine, which can be used to synthesise semi-synthetic opioids as well as other drugs like stimulants, emetics, opioid antagonists, anticholinergics, and smooth-muscle agents.|$|E
25|$|Lavoisier showed {{at the end}} of the 18th {{century that}} organic {{substances}} consisted of a limited number of elements: primarily carbon and hydrogen and supplemented by oxygen and nitrogen. He went quickly focus on the isolation of these substances, often because they had an interesting pharmacological activity. Plants were the main source of such compounds, especially alkaloids and glycosides. It was long been known that opium, a sticky mixture of alkaloids (including codeine, morphine, noscapine, <b>thebaine,</b> and papaverine) from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum), possessed a narcotic and at the same time mind-altering properties. Already in 1805 was morphine isolated by the German chemist Friedrich Sertürner and in the 1870s it was discovered that boiling morphine with acetic anhydride produced a substance with a strong pain suppressive effect: heroin. In 1815, Eugène Chevreul isolated from animal tissue cholesterol, a crystalline substance that belongs to the class of steroids, and in 1820 was strychnine, an alkaloid was isolated.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{poppy seed}} {{consumption}} does {{not serve as}} a defense for heroin consumption. [...] This is because a unique metabolite (6-monoacetylmorphine) is produced from heroin use that is never produced from consuming any other substance, even other opiates like the ones present in poppy seeds. [...] Modern tests can thus readily determine whether it was heroin or some other opiate that was ingested, should someone who had used heroin try to claim he or she merely ate poppy seeds. It is widely believed {{that there is no}} way to distinguish between poppy seeds and any other kind of opiate. However a study published by the University of Connecticut's Department of Chemistry, proposed that <b>Thebaine</b> could be used as a marker of poppy seed consumption. They examined the urine of test subjects given 11grams of poppy seeds, the urine of heroin users and clean urine spiked with <b>thebaine,</b> as a reference for GC-MS. They also tested street heroin, 1 morphine tablet and 1 codeine tablet. Urine specimens were screened by EMIT and confirmed for <b>thebaine</b> by GC-MS using a solid-phase extraction method. Only the subjects who had consumed the poppy seeds had <b>thebaine</b> in their urine, with concentrations ranging from 2 to 81ng/mL with a limit of detection of 0.5ng/mL. <b>Thebaine</b> was not detected in any of the tested powdered drugs (street heroin, morphine tablet, codeine tablet) or the urine of the heroin users.|$|E
2500|$|Morphine is biosynthesized in {{the opium}} poppy from the tetrahydroisoquinoline reticuline. It is {{converted}} into salutaridine, <b>thebaine,</b> and oripavine. The [...] enzymes {{involved in this}} process are the salutaridine synthase, [...] and the codeinone reductase. Researchers are attempting to reproduce the biosynthetic pathway that produces morphine in genetically engineered yeast. In June 2015 the S-reticuline could be produced from sugar and R-reticuline could be converted to morphine, but the intermediate reaction could not be performed. In August 2015 the first complete synthesis of <b>thebaine</b> and hydrocodone in yeast were reported, but the process {{would need to be}} 100,000 times more productive to be suitable for commercial use.|$|E
2500|$|Some minor opium {{alkaloids}} and various substances with opioid action {{are also found}} elsewhere, including molecules present in kratom, Corydalis, and Salvia divinorum plants and some species of poppy aside from Papaver somniferum. There are also strains which produce copious amounts of <b>thebaine,</b> an important raw material for making many semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids. [...] Of all {{of the more than}} 120 poppy species, only two produce morphine.|$|E
2500|$|Opium poppies {{are popular}} and {{attractive}} garden plants, whose flowers vary greatly in color, size and form. A modest amount of domestic cultivation in private gardens {{is not usually}} subject to legal controls. In part, this tolerance reflects variation in addictive potency. A cultivar for opium production, Papaver somniferum L. elite, contains 91.2 percent morphine, codeine, and <b>thebaine</b> in its latex alkaloids, whereas in the latex of the condiment cultivar [...] "Marianne", these three alkaloids total only 14.0 percent. The remaining alkaloids in the latter cultivar are primarily narcotoline and noscapine.|$|E
2500|$|Heroin, {{the first}} semi-synthetic opioid, was first {{synthesized}} in 1874, {{but was not}} pursued until its rediscovery in 1897 by Felix Hoffmann at the Bayer pharmaceutical company in Elberfeld, Germany. From 1898 to 1910 heroin was marketed as a non-addictive morphine substitute and cough medicine for children. Because the lethal dose of heroin {{was viewed as a}} hundred times greater than its effective dose, heroin was advertised as a safer alternative to other opioids. By 1902, sales made up 5 percent of the company's profits, and [...] "heroinism" [...] had attracted media attention. Oxycodone, a <b>thebaine</b> derivative similar to codeine, was introduced by Bayer in 1916 and promoted as a less-addictive analgesic. Preparations of the drug such as oxycodone with paracetamol and extended release oxycodone remain popular to this day.|$|E
2500|$|Codeine {{has been}} used in the past as the {{starting}} material and prototype of a large class of mainly mild to moderately strong opioids; such as hydrocodone (1920 in Germany), oxycodone (1916 in Germany), dihydrocodeine (1908 in Germany), and its derivatives such as nicocodeine (1956 in Austria). However, these opioids are no longer synthesized from codeine and are usually synthesized from other opium alkaloids; specifically <b>thebaine.</b> [...] Other series of codeine derivatives include isocodeine and its derivatives, which were developed in Germany starting around 1920. [...] In general, the various classes of morphine derivatives such as ketones, semisynthetics like dihydromorphine, halogeno-morphides, esters, ethers, and others have codeine, dihydrocodeine, and isocodeine analogues. [...] The codeine ester acetylcodeine is a common active impurity in street heroin as some codeine tends to dissolve with the morphine when it is extracted from opium in underground heroin and morphine base labs.|$|E
2500|$|Opium (poppy tears, {{with the}} {{scientific}} name: Lachryma papaveris) is the dried latex {{obtained from the}} opium poppy (scientific name: Papaver somniferum). Opium latex contains approximately 12 percent of the analgesic alkaloid morphine, which is processed chemically to produce heroin and other synthetic opioids for medicinal use and for illegal drug trade. The latex also contains the closely related opiates codeine and <b>thebaine,</b> and non-analgesic alkaloids such as papaverine and noscapine. The traditional, labor-intensive method of obtaining the latex is to scratch ("score") the immature seed pods (fruits) by hand; the latex leaks out and dries to a sticky yellowish residue that is later scraped off and dehydrated. The word [...] "meconium" [...] (derived from the Greek for [...] "opium-like", but now {{used to refer to}} infant stools) historically referred to related, weaker preparations made {{from other parts of the}} opium poppy or different species of poppies.|$|E

50|$|Thevinone is a {{derivative}} of <b>thebaine.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2012 146,000 {{kilograms}} of <b>thebaine</b> were produced. In 2013, Australia {{was the main}} producer of poppy straw rich in <b>thebaine,</b> followed by Spain and then France. Together, those three countries accounted for about 99 per cent of global production of such poppy straw.|$|E
50|$|Dried Papaver somniferum {{capsules}} {{and stems}} will, if harvested and dried by the usual protocol, contain significantly lower quantities of <b>thebaine</b> than opium made from latex {{as well as}} somewhat more codeine. When ingested, <b>thebaine</b> causes nausea, vomiting, and myoclonus. <b>Thebaine</b> is an important precursor for manufacture of pharmaceuticals, and is more concentrated in the roots of Papaver somniferum than elsewhere. Other species of poppies, numbering in the hundreds, do not contain morphine or codeine in useful amounts, but may contain non-narcotic alkaloids like protopine, sanguinarine or berberine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thebaine</b> (paramorphine), {{also known}} as codeine methyl enol ether, is an opiate alkaloid, its name coming from the Greek Θῆβαι, Thēbai (Thebes), an ancient city in Upper Egypt. A minor {{constituent}} of opium, <b>thebaine</b> is chemically similar to both morphine and codeine, but has stimulatory rather than depressant effects. At high doses, it causes convulsions similar to strychnine poisoning. The synthetic enantiomer (+)-thebaine does show analgesic effects apparently mediated through opioid receptors, unlike the inactive natural enantiomer (−)-thebaine. While <b>thebaine</b> is not used therapeutically, it is the main alkaloid extracted from Papaver bracteatum (Iranian poppy) and can be converted industrially {{into a variety of}} compounds, including oxycodone, oxymorphone, nalbuphine, naloxone, naltrexone, buprenorphine and etorphine. Butorphanol can also be derived from <b>thebaine</b> and is scheduled separately from butorphanol derived by other processes.|$|E

50|$|Oripavine {{possesses}} an analgesic potency {{comparable to}} morphine; however, {{it is not}} clinically useful due to severe toxicity and low therapeutic index. In both mice and rats, toxic doses caused tonic-clonic seizures followed by death, similar to <b>thebaine.</b> Oripavine has a potential for dependence which is significantly {{greater than that of}} <b>thebaine</b> but slightly less than that of morphine.|$|E

50|$|Salutaridinol can be {{converted}} in two reaction steps to the morphine precursor <b>thebaine.</b> The first step is an esterification of the hydroxyl group previously reduced in the conversion of salutaridine to salutaridinol with acetyl-CoA. This step is mediated by the enzyme salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase. The second step is a ring closure achieved by a nucleophilic attack of the phenol group on the dienol system to generate an oxide bridge and kick out an acetate leaving group, giving <b>thebaine.</b> This second step does not require an enzyme. <b>Thebaine</b> can then {{be converted}} to morphine through two slightly different biosynthetic routes, one of which makes use of the fourth enzyme codeinone reductase.|$|E
