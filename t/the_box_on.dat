5|$|Drogba came on as a {{substitute}} for Anelka against Manchester United in the Community Shield, but could not help prevent Chelsea from succumbing to a 3–1 loss. However, he started the Premier League season in fine form, continuing from where he left off {{on the last day of}} the previous campaign as he scored a hat-trick against West Bromwich Albion in a 6–0 victory. In Chelsea's next game against Wigan Athletic at the DW Stadium, Drogba made three assists in another 6–0 win. Drogba also played the next game at home against Stoke City where he played the whole 90 minutes and scored his fourth Premier League goal of the season when he kicked home a penalty after Nicolas Anelka was brought down by Thomas Sørensen inside <b>the</b> <b>box.</b> <b>On</b> 7 November 2010, Drogba missed the first half of Chelsea's 2–0 defeat by Liverpool. It was later revealed that he had been suffering from malaria for at least a month. He had first complained of feeling unwell before the October 2010 international break but the illness was only diagnosed on 8 November 2010. Having diagnosed the problem, Chelsea insisted that he would make a full recovery within days.|$|E

25|$|On 28 January 2011, despite {{interest}} from Rangers, Commons signed a three-and-a-half-year deal with Celtic {{for a fee}} of around £300,000 and was given squad number 15. The following day, he made an immediate impact, scoring the opening goal on his debut in Celtic's 4–1 League Cup semi-final win against Aberdeen with a lob from outside <b>the</b> <b>box.</b> <b>On</b> 6 February, Commons scored against Rangers in a Scottish Cup tie at Ibrox. The match ended 2–2. On his home debut at Celtic Park, he again scored against Rangers to add Celtic's third goal. In his next home league game, Commons scored both goals, including a volley from 25 yards, as Celtic won 2–0 against Hamilton. Commons had now {{become an integral part}} of the Celtic side; playing just behind the main strikers, occasionally in a central role but more often fielded wide left.|$|E
25|$|On 1 September, Benfica signed Bryan Cristante and {{extended}} Sílvio's loan. On 11 September, Benfica signed Jonas. On 12 September, after the early {{break for the}} Euro 2016 qualifying, Benfica returned with a 0–5 win at Vitória de Setúbal, with a hat-trick from Talisca, in his first goals in the Primeira Liga. Furthermore, Samaris and Cristante made their debuts for Benfica, while Ola John scored his first goal in the league. On 16 September, in the first matchday of the Champions League, Benfica lost 0–2 to Zenit. Hulk scored, Artur was sent off for a foul on Danny outside of the box, and former Benfica player Witsel scored the second goal. It was Benfica's first home defeat in 51 matches, and the first home defeat in the Champions League since 2 October 2012. On 21 September, Benfica struggled to defeat Moreirense, suffering an early goal from João Pedro in the debut of Júlio César. In the second half, after Marcelo Oliveira was sent off for tackling Talisca, Eliseu scored from 30 meters out; eight minutes later Maxi Pereira untied the match; and in the final minutes Lima scored from penalty kick after being tackled in <b>the</b> <b>box.</b> <b>On</b> 27 September, Benfica won at Estoril (2–3) with two goals from Talisca and one from Lima.

25|$|The month {{started by}} a 5–2 victory over APOEL {{in the second}} leg of Champions League quarter-finals, giving an {{aggregate}} score 8–2 as Los Blancos advanced to the semi-finals against final hosts Bayern Munich. Real Madrid was resting some of their usual starters, but still managed to score five goals overall. Cristiano Ronaldo netted a brace and Kaká, José Callejón and Ángel Di María each scored one in the victory, while APOEL's goals were scored by Gustavo Manduca and Esteban Solari, later scoring a penalty given to the Cypriots after Hamit Altıntop's foul in <b>the</b> <b>box.</b> <b>On</b> 8 April, Real Madrid had a goalless draw against Valencia in La Liga, leading them only four points ahead of Barcelona. Three days later, on 11 April, Real Madrid beat Atlético Madrid in an away game 1–4. Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat trick including two astonishing goals and assisted Callejón to score the fourth goal to close the game. Atlético's only goal was netted by Radamel Falcao. On 14 April, Real Madrid beat Sporting de Gijón home 3–1 with goals from Higuaín, Ronaldo and Benzema. Sporting's only goal was a penalty given to them after a handball from Sergio Ramos in the box, which was scored by Miguel de las Cuevas. On 17 April, Real Madrid lost to Bayern Munich away at the Allianz Arena 2–1 in first leg of the Champions League semi-finals. Franck Ribéry and Mario Gómez scored for Bayern, while Mesut Özil netted Madrid's only goal. On 21 April, Real Madrid beat Barcelona in El Clásico in Camp Nou 1–2, extending their lead in La Liga to seven points with only four matches left, which all but decided the domestic title. Sami Khedira opened the scoring from a corner kick in the 17th minute which broke {{the record for the}} most goals scored in a domestic league, with 107. Alexis Sánchez equalized in the second half in the 70th minute, but only couple minutes later, Özil assisted and Ronaldo scored the winning goal of the game by shooting the ball over Víctor Valdés into the net. This was the first victory for Real Madrid in La Liga against their arch rivals in Camp Nou since 2007. On 25 April, in the second leg of the Champions League against Bayern Munich, Cristiano Ronaldo initially put Madrid up 2–0, but former Madrid player Arjen Robben netted an away goal back for Bayern with a penalty. The match ended 2–1 after extra time and as both sides were tied 3–3, it went to a shootout. During penalties, Iker Casillas made two saves but Ronaldo, Kaká and Ramos failed to convert their spot kicks and Madrid lost 3–1.|$|E

2500|$|Simulations {{demonstrate}} that a suitable [...] "nearest neighbour rule" [...] eventually results {{in all the}} particles swarming together, or moving in the same direction.

Swarming systems give rise to emergent behaviours which occur at many different scales, some of which are turning out to be both universal and robust. It has become a challenge in theoretical physics to find minimal statistical models that capture these behaviours.|$|E

2500|$|The {{plant and}} take off is {{initiated}} typically three steps out from the final step. Vaulters will usually count their steps backwards from their starting point to the box only counting the steps taken on the left foot (vice versa for left-handers) except for the second step from the box, which is taken by the right foot. For example; a vaulter on a [...] "ten count" [...] (referring {{to the number of}} counted steps from the starting point to the box) would count backwards from ten, only counting the steps taken with the left foot, until the last three steps taken and both feet are counted as three, two, one. These last three steps are normally quicker than the previous strides and are referred to as the [...] "turn-over". The goal of this phase is to efficiently translate the kinetic energy accumulated from the approach into potential energy stored by the elasticity of the pole, and to gain as much initial vertical height as possible by jumping off the ground. The plant starts with the vaulter raising their arms up from around the hips or mid-torso until they are fully outstretched above the head, with the right arm extended directly above the head and the left arm extended perpendicular to the pole (vice versa for left-handed vaulters). At the same time, the vaulter is dropping the pole tip into <b>the</b> <b>box.</b> <b>On</b> the final step, the vaulter jumps off the trail leg which should always remain straight and then drives the front knee forward. As the pole slides {{into the back of the}} box the pole begins to bend and the vaulter continues up and forward, leaving the trail leg angled down and behind.|$|E
