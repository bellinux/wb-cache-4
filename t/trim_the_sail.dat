5000|$|There {{are several}} sail trim {{adjustments}} {{that can be}} built into the Impulse's rigging and hull giving an Impulse sailor more options <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> on the water than those available to Laser sailors.|$|E
50|$|It {{is typical}} {{to run the}} halyards (lines used to raise and lower the sail) and sheets (lines used to <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail)</b> to the {{companionway}} on a junk rigged boat. This means that typical sailhandling can be performed from the relative safety of the cockpit, or even while the crew is below deck.|$|E
5000|$|In these {{diagrams}} {{the direction}} of travel changes {{with respect to the}} apparent wind (VA), which is constant for the purpose of illustration. In reality, for a constant true wind, apparent wind would vary with point of sail. Constant VA in these examples means that either VT or VB varies with point of sail; this allows the same polar diagram to be used for comparison with the same conversion of coefficients into units of force (in this case Newtons). In the examples for close-hauled and reach (left and right), the sail's angle of attack (Î± [...] ) is essentially constant, although the boom angle over the boat changes with point of sail to <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> close to the highest lift force on the polar curve. In these cases, lift and drag are the same, but the decomposition of total aerodynamic force (FT) into forward driving force (FR) and lateral force (FLAT) vary with point of sail. Forward driving force (FR) increases, as {{the direction of}} travel is more aligned with the wind, and lateral force (FLAT) decreases.|$|E

60|$|An exclamation of {{surprise}} broke from {{all on the}} deck of the Swan, and the men ran to the braces and sheets, in order to <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Like the symmetric, the Asymmetrical {{spinnaker}} {{is often}} {{stored in a}} turtle, with the corners on top for easy access. While a symmetric spinnaker is flown with a [...] "guy" [...] and a [...] "sheet", an asymmetric spinnaker is flown with a tackline and a [...] "sheet." [...] The tack attaches to the bow or (often retractable) bowsprit, and the two sheets attach to the clew. The head of the sail {{is attached to the}} spinnaker halyard, which is used to raise the sail. The sheets are passed to either side of the forestay, attached to the clew; they may be passed forward of the luff of the asymmetric, or aft of the luff of the asymmetric, between the tack line and the forestay. The sheet on the downwind (lee) side of the hull is used to <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail,</b> and the opposite sheet is left slack. Often a tack line is used at leading edge to provide adjustable tension on the luff of the spinnaker. To keep the tack near the centerline of the boat, it may be attached to the forestay with a sliding collar (often riding over the furled jib on parrel beads, tacker or similar device) adjustable with a down haul, or tack line [...] This allows the tack to slide up and down the forestay to adjust the luff tension. [...] On racing boats, the tack of the asymmetric is often rigged to a retractable bowsprit, which increases the foretriangle area and prevents interference with the jib. As this trend becomes more popular in racing boats, it may result in similar adaptations to cruising boats as well.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and after}} this, Link Merwell, {{see that you}} keep a civil tongue in your head," [...] {{answered}} Dave, and then he <b>trimmed</b> <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> of <b>the</b> ice-boat, shoved the craft around, {{and started for the}} river.|$|R
60|$|The voyage {{down to the}} Cape was wholly uneventful. The Paramatta {{was most}} {{fortunate}} in her weather and, beyond <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails,</b> <b>the</b> crew had a very easy time of it. Captain Wilson had, as he promised Miss Hudson, taken the opportunity, when Reuben was sitting idly on deck, of having a chat with him; {{but he did not}} learn much {{in the course of the}} conversation.|$|R
5000|$|A grinder is a {{crew member}} on a yacht whose duties include {{operating}} manual winches (called [...] "coffee grinders") that raise and <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> and move <b>the</b> boom. It is a physically demanding role with {{a significant impact on}} a racing yacht's overall performance.|$|R
60|$|The {{men whose}} duty {{it was to}} <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> ran to <b>the</b> sheets and braces. The Madras swept up into the wind, and, as her <b>sails</b> drew on <b>the</b> other tack, she came along on a course that would take her within a hundred yards of the brig.|$|R
6000|$|Towards morning, {{while it}} was yet dark, the Red Eric floated, and Captain Dunning, who had paced the deck all night with a {{somewhat}} impatient tread, called to the mate--"Now, Mr Millons, man the boats, and let some of the hands stand-by to <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> to <b>the</b> first puff of wind." ...|$|R
60|$|How {{we worked}} {{to push the}} vessel through the water! Darius and Bill plied the paddles with every ounce of {{strength}} in their bodies, while we on deck <b>trimmed</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> to a nicety, shifted everything movable to bring her into better trim for sailing, and even swung the two long sweeps outboard.|$|R
60|$|The {{fisherman}} and his boy took {{turn and}} turn, one steering {{and the other}} keeping a look-out forward and <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails.</b> <b>The</b> two passengers crouched huddled together against the weather rail. They were each too occupied with thought to have time for speech. Suddenly, after passing Claxton and rounding the point, they came in full sight of the Priory, every window of which was blazing with light. They could see dark figures passing to and fro against the glare.|$|R
50|$|Historically, large yachts {{were built}} {{with more than}} one mast in order to divide <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> area for easier handling. Today's {{technologies}} in spars, rigging, sailmaking, powered winches and electronics enable rigs with larger sail areas, higher aspect ratios, larger loads and simpler handling, allowing Mirabella V to be constructed with the tallest mast and largest jib of any sailing craft ever built at the time. One of the procurement challenges was finding sheets strong enough to <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails.</b>|$|R
60|$|By {{some odd}} {{reasoning}} or other, she had cajoled {{herself into the}} notion, that whoever steered the brigantine, for that period was captain. Wherefore, she gave herself mighty airs at the tiller; with extravagant gestures issuing unintelligible orders about <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails,</b> or pitching overboard something to see how fast we were going. All this much diverted my Viking, who several times was delivered of a laugh; a loud and healthy one to boot: a phenomenon worthy the chronicling.|$|R
60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour of this characteristic, and it is to be {{inferred}} agreeable navigation, brought the boat to the mouth of the inlet. Here a powerful effort forced her into the tide's-way, and she might be said to put forth on her voyage. But while the black crew were <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails,</b> and making <b>the</b> other necessary preparations for departure, a voice was heard hailing them from the shore, with an order rather than a request, that they would stay their movements.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately for {{the success}} of their story, the lugger hailed from a {{northern}} French port and, as not one on board understood either Spanish or Portuguese, they had no idea that the latter was the language in which the prisoners were speaking. After an hour of pretended despair, both rose from the deck on which they had been sitting and, on an order being given to <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails,</b> went to <b>the</b> ropes and aided the privateersmen to haul at them and, {{before the end of the}} day, were doing duty as regular members of the crew.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Master Ned, I was {{swabbing}} my own eyes; for it ain't in a man's {{nature to}} see a woman suffering like that, and so quiet and brave, without feeling somehow {{as if all the}} manliness had gone out of him. I could not say nothing. What could I say, knowing what the truth was? Then she burst out a-crying and a-sobbing, and I steals off without a word, and goes on deck and sets the men a-hauling at <b>the</b> sheets and <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails,</b> till I know there was not one of them but cussed me in his heart and wished that the captain was back again.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> Art of <b>sailing</b> a {{wind powered}} vessel {{relies heavily on}} the ability of <b>the</b> crew to <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails.</b> Finding <b>the</b> right angle of <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> with respect to the vessel will apply the optimal amount of force with the least amount of drag on the boat. U sing {{the idea that there is}} an optimal sail angle, a device has been {{constructed}} which based on wind direction relative to the boat calculates <b>the</b> optimal <b>sail</b> angle and adjusts the mainsheet accordingly. The tender is designed as a modular system that functions independent of an autopilot program that would be set to maintain a heading, hence it can be used with any autopilot system currently on the market or used independently with a sailor steering the vessel...|$|R
60|$|Strange to say, {{none of our}} mutineers {{objected to}} this, and after dark, as we tore along before a {{full-sized}} gale, I sent my own men up on top the chart-house to take the gaskets off the spanker. This was <b>the</b> only <b>sail</b> we could set and trim and in every way control. It is true the mizzen-braces were still rigged aft to the poop, according to Horn practice. But, while we could thus <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> mizzen-yards, <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> themselves, in setting or furling, were {{in the hands of}} the for'ard crowd.|$|R
50|$|Moveable {{lines that}} control sails or other {{equipment}} are known collectively as a vessel's running rigging. Lines that raise sails are called halyards while those that strike them are called downhauls. Lines that adjust (<b>trim)</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> are called sheets. These are {{often referred to}} using the name of <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> they control (such as main sheet, or jib sheet). Sail trim may also be controlled with smaller lines attached to the forward section of a boom such as a cunningham; a line used to hold the boom down is called a vang, or a kicker in the United Kingdom. A topping lift is used to hold a boom up in <b>the</b> absence of <b>sail</b> tension. Guys are used to control the ends of other spars such as spinnaker poles.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the boom}} is the spar {{at the foot}} of <b>the</b> junk <b>sail.</b> It {{supports}} <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> directly at <b>the</b> tack and the clew, and holds <b>the</b> junk <b>sail</b> assembly down due to the tack line or downhaul. In modern rigs, the boom is controlled by the sheet and is responsible for <b>the</b> mailsail <b>trim.</b> However, in <b>the</b> junk rig, the boom is only partially in control of <b>the</b> <b>trim</b> of <b>the</b> <b>sail,</b> because <b>the</b> sheets are connected to both the boom and several of the battens.|$|R
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} September Spitfire {{detained}} the American merchantman Robust, on {{passage from}} Baltimore to Amsterdam, off the Eddystone. Kean put a mate and six men on board as a prize crew and sent her to Plymouth. On the way, while three men were aloft <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails,</b> two in <b>the</b> hold stowing the cable tier, one at the helm, and the prize-master having breakfast, the Americans, armed with pistols, seized the steersman and the prize master. The Americans threatened to shoot the men aloft and below if the prize crew did not give up the ship. The Americans put the prize crew into a boat, and after a long pull the seven men reached Salcombe. Robust resumed her voyage, reaching Amsterdam.|$|R
50|$|On the bays near New York, a {{peculiar}} kind of iceboat has developed, called scooter, {{which may be}} described as a toboggan with a sail. A typical scooter is about 15 ft long with an extreme beam of 5 ft, perfectly oval in form and flat. It has mainsail and jib carried on a mast 9 or 10 feet long and set well aft, and is provided with two long parallel metal runners. There is no rudder, the scooter being steered entirely by <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails,</b> particularly <b>the</b> jib. As the craft is flat and buoyant, it sails well in water, and can thus be used on very thin ice without danger. A speed of 50 km/h has been attained by a scooter.|$|R

60|$|Twice {{when the}} vessels were coming down before {{the wind at}} a rate of speed that {{rendered}} it evident that the efforts of the men at the oars would be insufficient to turn her course, the Fan Fan was steered alongside, grapnels were thrown, and, headed by Lord Oliphant and Cyril, the crew sprang on board, cut down or drove overboard the few men who were in charge of her. Then, taking <b>the</b> helm and <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails,</b> they directed her against one of the Dutch men-of-war, threw the grapnels on board, lighted the train, leapt back into the Fan Fan, rowed away, and took up their place near the Admiral, the little craft being greeted with hearty cheers by the whole ship's company.|$|R
5|$|Wind shear affects sailboats {{in motion}} by {{presenting}} a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the mast.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a combined helm-sails controller for a sailboat based on fuzzy logic. Autonomous navigation of sailboats {{is a very}} nonlinear and time-variant problem, and modeling ship dynamics considering all real phenomena {{is a very complex}} task. Besides, it has to compensate for stochastic disturbances acting upon it, such as wind, waves, and currents. Heuristics in sailing plays an important role: sailing rules obtained from skippers can be included in a knowledge base to govern the boat correctly in different conditions. The controller measures variables such as heading and wind angle. It processes the data through a fuzzy inference system according to a sailing knowledge base and actuates the helm and <b>the</b> <b>sails.</b> Experiments with a scale prototype show the ability of a fuzzy controller to govern <b>the</b> helm and <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> on a sailboat. Sea navigation aid systems and autonomous ocean sampling vehicles could be some areas of application of such a fuzzy system...|$|R
50|$|In 1967, {{while driving}} between {{his home and}} a {{contract}} at the Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, Drake had {{time to reflect on}} early 17th century based sail ship control. Rudders then were weak and ineffective, mostly used for trimming course. Hence with multi-masted boats, <b>the</b> sailors would <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>sails</b> on <b>the</b> forward and rearwards masts to steer the ship.|$|R
60|$|Baffling {{and light}} airs kept the Winkelried {{a long time}} nearly stationary, {{and it was only}} by paying the {{greatest}} attention to <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> and to all the little minutiÃ¦ of the waterman's art that the vessel was worked into the eastern horn of the crescent, as the sun touched the hazy line of the Jura. Here the wind tailed entirely, the surface of the lake becoming as glassy and smooth as a mirror, and further motion, for the time at least, was quite out of the question. The crew, perceiving the hopelessness of their exertions, and fatigued with the previous toil, threw themselves among the boxes and bales, and endeavored to catch a little sleep, in anticipation of the north breeze, which, at this season of the year, usually blew from the shores of Vaud within an hour or two of the disappearance of the sun.|$|R
25|$|The mast head {{instruments}} {{indication of}} apparent wind speed and direction {{is different from}} what the sailor sees and feels near the surface. Sailmakers may introduce <b>sail</b> twist in <b>the</b> design of <b>the</b> <b>sail,</b> where <b>the</b> head of <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> is set at a different angle of attack from the foot of <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> in order to change the lift distribution with height. The effect of wind gradient can be factored into the selection of twist in <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> design, but this {{can be difficult to}} predict since the wind gradient may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust <b>the</b> <b>trim</b> of <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> to account for wind gradient, for example using a boom vang.|$|R
5000|$|The {{running rigging}} that sets or <b>trims</b> <b>the</b> junk <b>sail</b> (controls <b>the</b> {{angle of attack}} {{relative}} to {{the direction of the}} wind) is the sheet. On a traditional Chinese junk rig, <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> is controlled by sheetletsâsmall sheet lines running from the battens to blocks that in turn are on lines running through a euphroe, a long piece of wood with holes in it. This helps maintain uniform tension in each panel of <b>the</b> <b>sail.</b> Western ship designers Tom Colvin, Michael Kasten and Herbert [...] "Blondie" [...] Hasler use the same technique, but others (such as Derek Van Loan and Phil Bolger) use a simplified design without euphroes.|$|R
60|$|Not {{very long}} ago a large Spanish ship was saved by one of our lifeboats. She had {{grounded}} on a bank off the south coast of Ireland. The captain and crew forsook her and escaped to land in their boats. One man, however, was inadvertently left on board. Soon after, the wind shifted; the ship slipped off the bank into deep water, and drifted to the northward. Her doom appeared to be fixed, but {{the crew of the}} Cahore lifeboat observed her, launched their boat, and, after a long pull against wind and sea, boarded the ship and found her with seven feet of water in the hold. The duty of the boat's crew was to save the Spanish sailor, but they did more, they worked <b>the</b> pumps and <b>trimmed</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> and saved <b>the</b> ship as well, and handed her over to an agent for the owners. This vessel and cargo was valued at 20,000 pounds.|$|R
40|$|Canada {{has been}} very much at {{the centre of the}} {{establishment}} of the International Criminal Court (ICC) since the momentum shifted in late- 1994 from the International Law Commission (ILC) to more broadly representative bodies established by the General Assembly. It was Canada that chaired the âlike-mindedâ, a group of states active during the several sessions of the Preparatory Committee and during the Diplomatic Conference in Rome from 15 June to 17 July 1998. The âlike-mindedâ were committed to invigorating the ILC's draft statute by enhancing the independence of <b>the</b> Prosecutor and <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> of <b>the</b> Security Council. At Rome, Canadian diplomat Philippe Kirsch was elected chair of the Committee of the Whole, and he directed the intense negotiations throughout the five-week session. Kirsch crafted the final package of compromises that was submitted to the Conference at its close, on the morning of 17 July, and that succeeded in rallying the vast majority of delegations when put to a vote later that day. Since then, Kirsch and his team have presided over the ongoing work of the Preparatory Commission...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Arabin {{had never}} thought of <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> <b>sails</b> of his bark so that he might sail as convoy to this rich argosy.
