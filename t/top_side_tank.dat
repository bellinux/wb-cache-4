500|$|There {{are various}} ways {{to define the}} term bulk carrier. As of 1999, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea defines a bulk carrier as [...] "a ship {{constructed}} with a single deck, <b>top</b> <b>side</b> <b>tanks</b> and hopper <b>side</b> <b>tanks</b> in cargo spaces and intended to primarily carry dry cargo in bulk; an ore carrier; or a combination carrier." [...] However, most classification societies use a broader definition where a bulker is any ship that carries dry unpackaged goods. Multipurpose cargo ships can carry bulk cargo, but can also carry other cargoes and are not specifically designed for bulk carriage. The term [...] "dry bulk carrier" [...] is used to distinguish bulkers from bulk liquid carriers such as oil, chemical, or liquefied petroleum gas carriers. [...] Very small bulkers are almost indistinguishable from general cargo ships, and they are often classified based more on the ship's use than its design.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, {{several of the}} WW class {{locomotives}} transferred from the North Island to Greymouth were altered to operate on the Rewanui Incline by the provision of 'trap-door' cowcatchers to clear the centre rail and additional air reservoirs on the <b>tops</b> of the <b>side</b> <b>tanks.</b> Following {{the removal of the}} centre rail in 1966, the locomotives' extra reservoirs were removed and the original brake pump was replaced by two larger pumps, one {{on each side of the}} smokebox.|$|R

25|$|The {{length of}} <b>side</b> <b>tanks</b> was often limited {{in order to}} give access to the inside motion. If it was desired to extend them {{to the front of the}} {{locomotive}} for greater capacity, access could be facilitated by apertures provided at the appropriate location. With larger <b>side</b> <b>tanks</b> it was sometimes necessary to taper the tanks slightly at the front end to improve forward visibility. <b>Side</b> <b>tanks</b> almost all stopped at, or before, the end of the boiler barrel, with the smokebox protruding ahead. A few designs did reach to the front of the smokebox and these were termed 'flatirons'.|$|R

5000|$|The Midland Railway 2000 Class was a {{class of}} 40 0-6-4T steam {{locomotives}} designed by Richard Deeley.
