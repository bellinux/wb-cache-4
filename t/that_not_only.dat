5|$|A {{variant of}} the minimax path problem has also been {{considered}} for sets of points in the Euclidean plane. As in the undirected graph problem, this Euclidean minimax path problem can be solved efficiently by finding a Euclidean minimum spanning tree: every path in the tree is a minimax path. However, the problem becomes more complicated when a path is desired <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> minimizes the hop length but also, among paths with the same hop length, minimizes or approximately minimizes the total length of the path. The solution can be approximated using geometric spanners.|$|E

5|$|As {{it became}} {{apparent}} <b>that,</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> were conditions in the ghettos terrible (hunger, diseases, etc.), but that the Jews were being singled out for extermination at Nazi concentration camps, they increasingly tried to escape and hide {{in order to survive}} the war.

5|$|Despite {{its initial}} plausibility, the {{identity}} theory faces a strong {{challenge in the}} form of the thesis of multiple realizability, first formulated by Hilary Putnam. It is obvious <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> humans, but many different species of animals can, for example, experience pain. However, it seems highly unlikely that all of these diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state. And if this is the case, then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.|$|E

5|$|The Stuarts {{used their}} {{connection}} with Fleance and {{his marriage to}} the Welsh princess to claim a genealogical link with the legendary King Arthur.

In 1722, however, Richard Hay, a Scottish historian, presented strong evidence <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> was James not a descendant of Fleance, but also that neither Fleance nor Banquo ever even existed.

5|$|The {{continuation}} of Octel Freight Traffic until 1993 ensured <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> was the trackbed kept whole, {{but the majority}} of the rail infrastructure was still in situ. As such, the Amlwch line was well suited to preservation as a heritage railway, or see a return of mainline services.
