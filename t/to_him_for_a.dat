May bought Moore's Selsey home in 2008, leasing it back <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> peppercorn rent the same day to provide financial security. May, Moore and Chris Lintott co-wrote a book Bang! The Complete History of the Universe. In February 2011, Moore completed (with Robin Rees and Iain Nicolson) his comprehensive Patrick Moore's Data Book of Astronomy for Cambridge University Press. In 1986 he was identified as the co-author of a book published in 1954 called Flying Saucer from Mars, attributed to Cedric Allingham, which was intended as a money-making venture and practical joke on UFO believers; Moore never admitted his involvement. He once joined the Flat Earth Society as an ironic joke.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{years later}} the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says: plundered the English {{as far as the}} river Tees, and he seized a {{multitude}} of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week's time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited him, as I have said. Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.|$|E

25|$|Christophe {{was still}} in Grenoble {{at the start of}} stage eleven, when tour {{organiser}} Henri Desgrange gave him a yellow jersey, so that he could easily be recognized. The colour was inspired by the colour of the organizing newspaper l'Auto, although another explanation is that other colours were not available in the post-war shortage. Christophe was not happy with his yellow jersey, and other cyclists called him a canary. At that point in the race, it was likely that Christophe would stay the leader {{until the end of the}} Tour de France, because he remained in that yellow jersey after the Pyrénées and the Alps. In the penultimate stage, Firmin Lambot, who was in second position, more than 28 minutes behind, attacked. Christophe, still leading the race, chased him, but broke his fork close to Valenciennes. The rules were such that cyclists could get no help at all, so Christophe repaired his bicycle himself. This same thing had already cost him the victory in 1913, and would happen <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> third time in 1922. It took him over two and a half hours, and he had lost the lead to Lambot. In the last stage, Christophe had a record number of punctures, and also lost his second place to Jean Alavoine.|$|E
25|$|The next {{match was}} the SmackDown!/ECW Elimination Chamber match between The Undertaker, Batista, Big Daddy V (with Matt Striker), Finlay, The Great Khali (with Ranjin Singh) and Montel Vontavious Porter. Batista and Undertaker were {{selected}} to start the match. Undertaker gained control of the match early after tossing Batista over the top rope onto the chamber's steel surface. In the ring, both men were knocked down by delivering a big boot to each other. The third entrant, Big Daddy V, then entered, and dominated both The Undertaker and Batista for some time, until Batista performed a Spinebuster on Big Daddy V. Shortly after, The Undertaker executed a DDT on the steel floor of the chamber on Big Daddy V and Batista pinned him, thus eliminating him. The fourth entrant was The Great Khali, who also dominated upon entering, but was eliminated when he submitted to Gogoplata submission hold. The fifth entrant was Finlay, who gained the advantage over Batista by tossing him into the steel chains of the chamber, and over Undertaker by delivering a Celtic Cross <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> near-fall. Finlay also slammed Undertaker's head into a pod, breaking it and causing Undertaker to start bleeding. The sixth entrant, MVP, was attacked by Undertaker when his pod was opened. MVP used a steel chain as a weapon on the other three competitors, until he {{climbed to the top}} of a pod. Undertaker followed and delivered a chokeslam to MVP from the top of the pod onto the ring, which cost MVP the match as Finlay pinned MVP and eliminated him. Later, Hornswoggle passed a shillelagh to Finlay from under the ring, which he used on both Batista and Undertaker. He was soon eliminated by Undertaker who pinned him after a Chokeslam onto the chamber floor. The final two men were Batista and Undertaker. Batista gained advantage after delivering a Batista Bomb, but Undertaker kicked out, which led to Batista tossing Undertaker into the chamber wall. Undertaker however, retaliated and countered a powerslam attempt on the outside, bringing both men in, and delivered a Tombstone piledriver and pinned Batista, winning the match and earning a World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXIV.|$|E

500|$|Chusid notes Strepponi's {{description}} of the operas of the 1860s and 1870s as being [...] "modern" [...] whereas Verdi described the pre-1849 works as [...] "the cavatina operas", as further indication that [...] "Verdi became increasingly dissatisfied with the older, familiar conventions of his predecessors that he had adopted {{at the outset of}} his career," [...] Parker sees a physical differentiation of the operas from Les vêpres siciliennes (1855) to Aida (1871) is that they are significantly longer, and with larger cast-lists, than previous works. They also reflect a shift towards the French genre of grand opera, notable in more colorful orchestration, counterpointing of serious and comic scenes, and greater spectacle. The opportunities of transforming Italian opera by utilising such resources appealed <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> commission from the Paris Opéra he expressly demanded a libretto from Eugène Scribe, the favorite librettist of Meyerbeer, telling him: [...] "I want—in fact, I must have—a grandiose, impassioned and original subject." [...] The result was Les vêpres siciliennes, and the scenarios of Simon Boccanegra (1857), Un ballo in maschera (1859), La forza del destino (1862), Don Carlos (1865) and Aida (1872) all meet the same criteria. Porter notes that Un ballo marks an almost complete synthesis of Verdi's style with the grand opera hallmarks, such that [...] "huge spectacle is not mere decoration but essential to the drama...musical and theatrical lines remain taut [...] the characters still sing as warmly, passionately and personally as in Il trovatore." ...|$|E

Shechem loved Dinah and asked Hamor to arrange that he might marry her. Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled Dinah while Jacob's sons were in the field, and Jacob held his peace until they returned. When Jacob's sons heard, they came in from the field very angry. Hamor went out to Jacob and told him that Shechem longed for Dinah, and asked Jacob to give her <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wife, and to agree that their two people might intermarry and live and trade together. And Shechem offered to give Jacob and his sons {{whatever}} they wanted as a bride price. Jacob's sons answered with guile, saying that they could not give their sister to one not circumcised, and said that they would consent only on the condition that every man of the town became circumcised, and then the two people might intermarry and live together; otherwise they would leave. Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, and Shechem did so without delay, out of delight with Dinah. Hamor and Shechem spoke to the men of the city in the city gate, saying that Jacob's family were peaceable, and advocated letting them dwell in the land, trade, and intermarry. Hamor and Shechem reported that Jacob's people would only do so on the condition that every man of the town was circumcised, and they argued that the men do so, for Jacob's animals and wealth would add to the city's wealth. The men heeded Hamor and Shechem, and every man of the city underwent circumcision. On the third day, when the men of the city were in pain, Jacob's sons Simeon and Levi each took his sword, came upon the city with stealth, and killed all the men, including Hamor and Shechem, and took Dinah out of the city. Jacob's sons looted the city, taking as booty their animals, their wealth, their wives, and their children. Jacob told Simeon and Levi that they had made him odious to the inhabitants of the land, who would gather together against him and destroyed their family.
