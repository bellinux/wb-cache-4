Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn <b>the</b> <b>Jeep</b> right side up, load {{him back in the}} car, then push <b>the</b> <b>Jeep</b> down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, the bear swings at her through a window sending her back against the trap, which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean's body.|$|E

5|$|Players {{control a}} monocle- and pith helmet–wearing Velociraptor driving a jeep. The {{aim of the}} game is to attain a high score by {{performing}} stunts, damaging <b>the</b> <b>jeep</b> during collisions, collecting orbs, and killing the other Velociraptor which run around the area. The vehicle is equipped with a spiked ball and chain which can be deployed from the tailgate as many times as the player wishes. Deploying the spiked ball increases the difficulty of maneuvering the vehicle. The ball can be released from the chain at any time, if done so during a turn the weapon is launched forward. Players kill other Velociraptor by ramming them with <b>the</b> <b>jeep</b> or crushing them with the spiked ball which is dragged behind the vehicle. Slain dinosaurs can be dragged to exporters by the spiked ball and chain to gain extra points. Exporters are teleporting devices which transport the slain dinosaurs to the future.|$|E
5|$|Wes grabs {{a can of}} {{gasoline}} and pours a trail from <b>the</b> <b>Jeep</b> to the woods. They lure the Grizzly Bear to it and then set the gasoline on fire. <b>The</b> <b>Jeep</b> explodes, but the bear is unharmed. They decide to try another plan and split up. Wes climbs a tree, leaving his blood covered clothes {{on the ground to}} fool the Bear. While the Bear is sniffing at the clothes, Wes accidentally drops a tire iron, calling the bear's attention up. The bear shakes him out of the tree but he escapes and goes to the shack where Lauren has built a trap. They lure the bear into the shack, and use a trigger to close the front door behind it, locking it in. They celebrate and start to leave but the bear breaks out of the shack and they both try to escape. Unfortunately, Wes stumbles and Lauren tries to get him back up, refusing to leave him behind despite his desperate insistence that she should run. The Bear catches up to them and presumably kills them both.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{includes}} vehicle sections, where Drake must protect <b>the</b> <b>jeep</b> he and Elena are in using a mounted turret, and where Drake and Elena ride a jet ski along water-filled routes while avoiding enemy fire and explosive barrels. While players direct Drake in driving the jet ski, {{they may also}} switch to Elena by aiming the gun {{in order to use}} her weapon — either the grenade launcher or the Beretta, depending on the chapter — in defense, or to clear the barrels from their path.|$|E

Gameplay {{takes place in}} a single tropical jungle area, {{at the beginning of a}} game <b>the</b> <b>jeep</b> appears in a random location within the jungle. Stunt ramps are set up throughout the game area, along with the hills and valleys these facilitate long-distance jumps and other stunts.

5|$|Since {{the number}} of pack animals and {{carriers}} was limited, the requirements for stores and supplies of all types, including rations, ammunition, ordnance, signals equipment and medical supplies, were submitted to 7th Division headquarters, which allocated movement priorities. One of Richardson's first actions was to obtain more saddlery for the pack horses. He also acquired five more American jeeps to augment the five that had been working <b>the</b> <b>jeep</b> track. The original five {{were found to be}} in poor condition, and needed overhaul. While the 25th Infantry Brigade was conducting operations in the Imita Ridge area, the carry was short, {{and despite the fact that}} there were no suitable air dropping zones, the supply situation was good. As the Australians began advancing toward Kokoda again in October, the supply line became steadily longer, and the demand for carriers more acute.|$|E

5|$|The {{plane is}} shot down mid-air, {{separating}} Nate from Elena when they parachute out. He tracks {{her to an}} old fort controlled by pirates led by Eddy Raja (James Sie), an old enemy of Drake's working for Roman who traps him and demands that he help him find the treasure. Elena arrives in a stolen jeep and breaks him out, but {{they are unable to}} outrun Eddy's men. Stalling for time, Nate manages to drive <b>the</b> <b>jeep</b> over a cliff and into a lake surrounding the colony's port. Tired, injured, and grieving Sully's death, Nate decides to give up and return home. Elena convinces him to see Drake's work through, and the two work together to reach the crumbling customs house, where Nate is able to trace the statue to an inland monastery. While on reconnaissance, they discover that Roman has also found the statue with help from the supposedly-dead Sully. While in pursuit, Elena falls through a bridge and reluctantly discards her camera so that Nate can save her. Nate subsequently catches up to Sully and accuses him of betrayal, to which Sully reveals that he was only pretending to help, having survived Roman's bullet because of Drake's notebook in his shirt's breast-pocket preventing a fatal wound.|$|E

50|$|The game {{starts with}} a pair of {{transport}} helicopters dropping player's <b>jeep</b> into <b>the</b> coast of the enemy territory, followed by a plane which drops <b>the</b> <b>jeep's</b> driver and gunner. The main objective is to penetrate the enemy's main headquarters and destroy their ultimate weapon. Along the way, the player will proceed through numerous internment camps where the POWs are being held. Prisoners held in solitary camps will upgrade <b>the</b> <b>jeep's</b> grenade/missile launcher by one level. <b>The</b> player's <b>jeep</b> can only carry up to eight prisoners and once it is filled, the player must drive to the nearest heliport where an extraction chopper awaits to retrieve them. The player receives more points if he extracts prisoners in succession. If the player successfully extracts eight prisoners in a row into <b>the</b> chopper, <b>the</b> <b>jeep's</b> missile launcher will be upgraded to the next level. Jackal does not have a traditional stage structure, instead the entire game takes place in one long continuous level. The player will go through a variety of different areas throughout the course of the mission such as an ancient ruins, a lake, a hill and a mountain before reaching the enemy headquarters. The background music changes the further the players goes into the game.|$|R

25|$|The French automaker Renault began {{investing}} in AMC in 1979. However, by 1987, the automobile markets had changed and even Renault itself was experiencing financial troubles. At the same time, Chrysler Corporation wanted to capture <b>the</b> <b>Jeep</b> brand, {{as well as}} other assets of AMC. Chrysler bought out AMC in 1987, shortly after <b>the</b> <b>Jeep</b> CJ-7 was replaced with the AMC-designed Jeep Wrangler or YJ. Chrysler merged with Daimler-Benz in 1998 to form DaimlerChrysler. DaimlerChrysler eventually sold most of their interest in Chrysler to a private equity company in 2007. Chrysler and <b>the</b> <b>Jeep</b> division operated under Chrysler Group LLC, until December 15, 2014, when the name was changed to FCA US LLC.|$|E

50|$|The {{military}} {{market for}} off-road vehicles {{used to be}} large, but, {{since the fall of}} the Iron Curtain in the 1990s, it has dried up to some extent. <b>The</b> U.S. <b>Jeep,</b> developed during World War II, coined the word many people use for any type of light off-road vehicle.
