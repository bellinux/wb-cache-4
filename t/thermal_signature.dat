25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{would then}} pull {{away at a}} sharp angle from the flare (and the terminal trajectory of the missile) and reduce engine power in attempt to cool the <b>thermal</b> <b>signature.</b> Optimally, the missile's seeker head is then confused by this change in temperature and flurry of new signatures, and therefore follows the flare(s) rather than the aircraft. The most modern IR-guided missiles have sophisticated on-board electronics that help discriminate between flares and targets, reducing the effectiveness of countermeasures.|$|E

In 2009 the Naval Research Laboratory's (NRL's) Ion Tiger utilized a hydrogen-powered fuel cell and flew for 23 hours and 17 minutes. Fuel cells are also in use to provide auxiliary power in aircraft, replacing fossil fuel generators that were previously used to start the engines and power on board electrical needs.|$|E

Without knowledge of the spatial and temporal variability of soil {{surface temperatures}}, {{it will be difficult}} to determine what times of day are most suitable for mine detection using Thermal Infra Red (TIR) technology. In this study we monitor the spatial and temporal variability of soil surface temperatures under a range of soil texture and soil moisture conditions on undisturbed plots and plots with a buried anti-tank mine in arid New Mexico. We also analyzed soil surface temperature measurements taken at the test facility for land mine detection systems at the TNO Physics and Electronics Laboratory under the temperate climatic conditions of The Netherlands. The measurements in both areas show a cyclic behavior of the <b>thermal</b> <b>signatures</b> of the mines during the day and night that can be predicted by physics of the mine-soil-sensor system.

First generation shoulder-fired SAMs, such as the U.S. Redeye, early versions of the Soviet SA-7, and the Chinese HN-5 (copy of Soviet Strela-2), are considered [...] "tail-chase weapons" [...] as their seekers can only acquire and engage a high performance aircraft after it has passed the missile's firing position. In this flight profile, the aircraft's engines are fully exposed to the missile's seeker and provide a sufficient <b>thermal</b> <b>signature</b> for engagement. First generation IR missiles are also highly susceptible to interfering thermal signatures from background sources, including the sun, which many experts feel makes them somewhat unreliable.|$|E

40|$|Streamflow {{cessation}} {{and drying}} {{occurs in the}} majority of the world's river networks, yet the spatio-temporal dynamics of short-lived surface-groundwater interactions are poorly understood. We develop a new method to characterise water flow in variably saturated dryland streambeds based on the depth propagation of the diurnal temperature amplitude ratio. A contrast in <b>thermal</b> <b>signatures</b> between dry or saturated conditions can be used to detect and characterise short-lived stream flow and surface-groundwater interactions. We deployed 10 streambed arrays to measure temperature and pressure time series along a 12 km stretch of a dryland channel where the groundwater is monitored at 4 locations by piezometers located in the alluvium. Analyses of the <b>thermal</b> <b>signatures</b> in conjunction with the pressure records illustrate that short-lived surface-groundwater interactions are complicated and highly variable in space and time. <b>Thermal</b> <b>signatures</b> were used to categorise short-lived surface-groundwater interactions into distinct hydrological regimes: (1) dry channel, (2) surface runoff, (3) pool-riffle sequences, (4) drying pools. Our analyses demonstrates that the rate of redistribution of infiltrated water controls the duration of the pool-riffle sequences regime, which either leads to ephemeral or intermittent stream flow behaviour. This subsurface water redistribution is determined by the hydraulic conductivity of the alluvium, i. e. the heterogeneity of sediments along the channel. Our new approach can be used to investigate how short-lived flow underpins dryland ecology, influences water quality and leads to groundwater recharge...|$|R

40|$|During the ERS 1 - 2 Tandem Mission in 1995 - 6, the {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) swath on one satellite overlapped the along-track scanning radiometer (ATSR) swath on the other with a 30 min interval, at latitudes greater than 50. A number of matching pairs of SAR and partially cloud-free ATSR images {{were found in the}} ERS archive covering the South Patagonian Shelf, the Drake Passage and the Antarctic Peninsula. The SAR. PRI image data were reduced to 200 m pixels by rms averaging, and the ATSR. GBT and. GSST 1 km image products were warped onto the same 200 m grid as the corresponding SAR scene. Following image enhancement, requiring a de-trending of the SAR image to remove the response of normalised radar cross section (NRCS) to the viewing geometry, visual comparison was made between the two types of data. While no strong mesoscale dynamical features were encountered, a number of small scale <b>thermal</b> <b>signatures</b> were detected, close to the coast or near the ice edge. A variety of signature types were found in the corresponding SAR scenes, which closely matched the location of the <b>thermal</b> <b>signatures,</b> including linear NRCS features, step changes of NRCS and changes in NRCS texture. In this remote region, for which there is little systematic oceanographic knowledge, the combination of the radar and <b>thermal</b> <b>signatures</b> facilitates the interpretation of the data, and demonstrates the usefulness of the synergetic approach for studying coastal ocean dynamics. Coupled with previous analyses of north-east Atlantic data, these matched image pairs point to the potential in future for oceanographic applications of synergetic analyses of combined simultaneous AATSR, ASAR (ScanSAR mode) and MERIS data from Envisat...|$|R
40|$|Sodium sulfates {{are well}} known {{to be the most}} {{damaging}} salts in building materials and rocks. Unfortu- nately, the crystallization processes of sodium sulfates are not completely understood. In addition, the metastable heptahydrate has long been neglected in scientific works on salt damage until recently. In this study, we use tempera- ture monitoring and differential scanning calorimetry to detect and identify the crystallization of sodium sulfate hydrates (i. e., mirabilite and heptahydrate) upon cooling/ heating a bulk solution. The presence of impurities seems {{to play a major role}} in the crystallization sequence and can explain the crystallization of mirabilite and ice close to - 10 °C. The crystallization of heptahydrate does not seem to be sensitive to the presence of impurities and does not always occur prior to the crystallization of mirabilite as commonly observed. The heptahydrate and mirabilite show different and characteristic <b>thermal</b> <b>signatures</b> that enable to distinguish each other. The shape, the intensity and the duration of the peak of temperature due to the crystalli- zation depict these differences. Therefore, the <b>thermal</b> <b>signatures</b> can be used in further experimental studies to estimate the role of the different sodium sulfate hydrates involved in the salt weathering of rocks...|$|R

40|$|Despite ephemeral or {{intermittent}} streamflow {{occurring in}} the majority of the world’s river networks, the spatio-temporal dynamics of transitory groundwater-surface water interactions are poorly understood.

We show how this can be used to detect and characterise short-lived stream flow and groundwater-surface water interactions, first outlining the theory, and then demonstrating the technique using a novel data set from the Maules Creek catchment in NSW, Australia. Analysis of the <b>thermal</b> <b>signatures</b> illustrates that short-lived groundwater-surface water interactions are highly variable in space and time but that a distinct cycle of hydrological regimes can be defined as follows: (1) dry channel, (2) surface runoff, (3) pool-riffle sequences, (4) drying pools. The rate of subsurface redistribution of infiltrated water controls the duration of the pool-riffle sequences regime, which either leads to ephemeral or intermittent stream flow behaviour, and is governed primarily by the heterogeneity of sediments along the channel.
