5|$|The magical {{and mystical}} {{side of the}} herbal also lives on. Herbals often {{explained}} plant lore, displaying a superstitious or spiritual side. There was, for example, the fanciful doctrine of signatures, the belief that there were similarities in <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{part of the body}} affected <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plant {{to be used as a}} remedy. The astrology of Culpeper can be seen in contemporary anthroposophy (biodynamic gardening) and alternative medical approaches like homeopathy, aromatherapy and other new age medicine show connections with herbals and traditional medicine.|$|E

5|$|Emperor {{penguins}} are serially monogamous. They {{have only}} one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 15%. The narrow window of opportunity available for mating {{appears to be an}} influence, as there is a priority to mate and breed which often precludes waiting for <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous year's partner.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{worsening}} kidney damage {{would normally}} prompt a kidney biopsy. Treatment may be indicated {{on the basis}} of <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biopsy sample; various treatments may be used, ranging from oral steroids to a combination of intravenous methylprednisolone (steroid), cyclophosphamide and dipyridamole followed by prednisone. Other regimens include steroids/azathioprine, and steroids/cyclophosphamide (with or without heparin and warfarin). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is occasionally used.|$|E

5|$|A second market cross, {{known as}} the Butter Cross, which {{was built in the}} 15th century used to stand near the Yarn Market but was moved to the {{outskirts}} of the village in the 18th or 19th centuries. The Yarn Market is in the guardianship of English Heritage but is managed by the National Trust. In 1951 the Ministry of Works took over various properties including the Yarn Market from the Crown Estate. They carried out restoration works, however this was controversial as the shape of the roof was changed to more closely resemble <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original building, rather than that produced by subsequent revisions.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{research}} {{increased at}} the turn of the 20th century, and as the Ministry of Works took control of the sites, government spending on these investigations began. Historians such as Sidney Toy and Charles Peers published work on the sites, and research continued under Arnold Taylor, who joined the Office of Works as an assistant inspector in 1935. Major academic reports were published in the 1950s, adding to the sites' reputation. Taylor was also instrumental in the successful opposition to road projects proposed in the 1970s which would have had a substantial impact on <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Conwy site. In the late 20th century, detailed reconstructions of the castles were painted by historical artists including Terry Ball, John Banbury and Ivan Lapper.|$|E
