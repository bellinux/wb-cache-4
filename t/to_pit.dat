5|$|Another {{round of}} green flag pit stops began on lap 203 when Truex made a pit stop; Kenseth {{was the first}} of the leaders <b>to</b> <b>pit</b> the {{following}} lap. On lap 208, Jeff Gordon became the new race leader after Biffle came into pit road. After pit stops, Biffle reclaimed the top position. On lap 220, the third caution was given as Ambrose's car suffered an engine failure. Jeff Gordon and Martin stayed out, while some of the leaders came <b>to</b> <b>pit</b> road.|$|E

5|$|The Red Bull of Mark Webber was {{the first}} <b>to</b> <b>pit,</b> on lap12. Webber had passed Barrichello and Piquet in {{separate}} manoeuvres to take ninth, but his pit stop dropped him back down to 18th position. Massa and Alonso came in <b>to</b> <b>pit</b> on lap14, from third and fourth. Kovalainen took {{the lead of the}} Grand Prix when Hamilton and Räikkönen paused their battle to take harder tyres and fuel on lap15. By the time Kovalainen and Heidfeld had pitted on laps17 and 18, Hamilton had established a commanding lead: 6.9seconds over Räikkönen and 14.1seconds over Massa. Räikkönen began to pull back Hamilton's lead over the next ten laps, before losing 1.4seconds on lap30.|$|E

5|$|At {{the final}} {{meeting of the}} World Motorsports Commission in December 2011, a series of {{amendments}} to the sporting regulations were published. Chief among these is the re-introduction of a rule that will allow all lapped traffic under the safety car (which remained the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG introduced in 2010) {{to be released from}} the queue before the car returns <b>to</b> <b>pit</b> lane, allowing the drivers to unlap themselves and to ensure a clean restart.|$|E
5|$|At {{the opening}} round in Australia, an error in {{qualifying}} left him in 10th on the grid {{for the start of}} the race. On the second lap of the race, Webber crashed with Heikki Kovalainen, Adrian Sutil and Nick Heidfeld following their efforts to avoid a collision with Rubens Barrichello, causing all except Barrichello <b>to</b> <b>pit.</b>|$|E
5|$|By lap 20, Max Verstappen, impeded by his tyre {{failure at}} the start, had moved up into twelfth {{while at the}} front, Hamilton {{extended}} his advantage over Bottas to 7.5 seconds on lap 24 with Vettel also moving closer to the Finn. After several drivers had opted <b>to</b> <b>pit</b> during the second safety car phase, most drivers at the front decided {{to come in for}} their regular pit stops starting on lap 25. Carlos Sainz crossed the white line when exiting pit lane, receiving a five-second penalty to be served at his second stop. Bottas {{was the first of the}} front runners <b>to</b> <b>pit</b> on lap 27, emerging into traffic. This allowed Sebastian Vettel to make up time by staying out longer, eventually emerging from his pit stop ahead of Bottas on lap 31. One lap later, Räikkönen made a pit stop as well, coming out just behind Bottas. Race leader Hamilton came in another lap later, retaining his lead without incident. On lap 37, Räikkönen used the Drag Reduction System (DRS) to move ahead of Bottas for fifth place, only for the Williams driver to retake the position in the next corner.|$|E

Addition of molybdenum to stainless steel is needed to improve its resistance <b>to</b> <b>pitting</b> (AISI 316L hMo). In alkaline aqueous conditions and medium temperature (60 °C), carbon steel {{and stainless steel}} (AISI 304L, 316L) are not attacked, even at high concentration of base (30%w KOH), thiosulfate (10%w) and in presence of fluoride ion (5%w KF).|$|R
5|$|By the ten-lap mark, Räikkönen {{had opened}} a three-second lead over Hamilton. Hamilton {{was the first}} of the leaders <b>to</b> <b>pit,</b> on lap11, {{followed}} by Räikkönen a lap later. Massa and Alonso pitted on lap13, with Heidfeld a lap after them. Heidfeld's BMW teammate Robert Kubica pitted on lap15, along with Bourdais. Räikkönen maintained his lead over Hamilton after the round of pit stops, followed by Massa, Alonso and Bourdais.|$|E
5|$|Green flag pit stops {{began on}} the 152nd lap; Kenseth made his pit stop on the same lap. Johnson and Biffle made a pit stop the next lap, handing the lead to Jeff Gordon. After pit stops, Biffle {{reclaimed}} the first position. On lap 157, Elliott Sadler spun out, causing the second caution. None of the leaders elected <b>to</b> <b>pit</b> under the caution. The race restarted on lap 162 with Biffle in the lead, ahead of Kenseth and Jeff Gordon. By the 190th lap, Biffle's lead was three seconds.|$|E
5|$|Häkkinen {{began to}} pull away from Trulli. Although Button tried to pass Trulli on the fourth lap at the Bus Stop chicane, he ran wide and lost third {{position}} to Michael Schumacher. On that lap, Alesi was the first driver <b>to</b> <b>pit</b> for dry tyres. By the beginning of the fifth lap Häkkinen increased his lead over Trulli to ten seconds, ahead of Michael Schumacher, Button and Coulthard. Button attempted to overtake Trulli around the outside of the Bus Stop chicane, but left the inside open for Schumacher to pass him for third place. Schumacher then took second place from Trulli at La Source. Button attempted to follow Schumacher down the inside, but made contact with the latter. Trulli was sent into a spin, becoming the first retirement of the race. Button lost two positions to Coulthard and Ralf Schumacher in the incident. On the next lap Michael and Ralf Schumacher were the first leaders <b>to</b> <b>pit</b> for dry tyres, as Alesi began setting faster lap times than the front-runners. Häkkinen made a pit stop from the lead on lap seven, followed by Button, and re-emerged ahead of Coulthard to retain the lead. Coulthard made his pit stop on the following lap, re-emerging in ninth position.|$|E

In addition, he also reluctantly picks Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Phyllis Lapin (Phyllis Smith), but refuses to pick Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) or Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner).|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} the {{starting}} grid, Carlos Sainz Jr. stopped on track and had to be pushed back <b>to</b> <b>pit</b> lane, where he eventually started, only to retire after just a few hundred metres. At the start, both Mercedes drivers got away well and Hamilton tried to overtake Rosberg for the lead around the outside of the first corner, but were unable to do so. Jenson Button made a good start, moving from 16th to 13th, while Marcus Ericsson fell from 13th to 18th. Behind the leaders, the Ferrari drivers retained third and fourth place respectively. Bottas moved into fifth after moving around the outside. Hamilton was able to follow Rosberg closely in the opening laps, while Daniel Ricciardo was the first driver <b>to</b> <b>pit</b> for new tyres on lap four. One lap later, Grosjean was able to use drag reduction system (DRS) to overtake Felipe Nasr for eleventh. With his back row start and an early pit stop, Ricciardo overtook the two Manor Marussia cars around lap nine.|$|E
5|$|On lap 199, Burton and David Reutimann {{moved into}} {{third and fourth}} {{respectively}} after passing Sadler. Five laps later, Martin passed Kurt Busch to claim the lead. On lap 208, Jeff Gordon had fallen to fourteenth position after minor contact with Johnson, while Hamlin and Montoya moved into fourth and sixth positions respectively. Three laps later, Montoya moved into fifth after passing Reutimann. On the 219th lap, Johnson passed Sadler for the seventh position. Nineteen laps later, Johnson passed Montoya to take over fifth, while Hamlin passed Burton to claim the second position. On lap 243, green flag pit stops began, as Martin was the first <b>to</b> <b>pit,</b> handing the lead back to Kurt Busch. On lap 248, Hamlin became the new race leader after Kurt Busch came into pit road. Twenty-one laps later, Kevin Harvick drove <b>to</b> <b>pit</b> road due to mechanical problems.|$|E
50|$|People of any age, race, or sex {{can fall}} victim to this disorder, though it is more {{commonly}} found in men. People who sweat or wash excessively tend to be prone <b>to</b> <b>pitted</b> keratolysis. The prolonged wearing of occlusive footwear, such as tight shoes or rubber boots, also makes one more susceptible. Not surprisingly, athletes and soldiers are extremely prone to this problem. Hot and humid weather is another factor for raising the risk. Those on immunosuppressive drug therapy or diabetes sufferers {{are also more likely}} <b>to</b> succumb <b>to</b> <b>pitted</b> keratolysis.|$|R

5|$|On lap 22 Adrian Sutil crashed at turn {{four and}} the safety car had to be deployed; Hamilton had pitted just before the incident. Thus the pit lane was closed but Alonso and Nico Rosberg were forced <b>to</b> <b>pit</b> {{in order to avoid}} running out of fuel, and were given ten-second stop-and-go penalties. When the pit lane was re-opened {{and the rest of the}} field pitted, Massa and Giancarlo Fisichella left the pit lane while the red light was still on. Both were later disqualified from the race on lap 51.|$|E
5|$|The 1978 Gillette Cup Final was a cricket {{match between}} Somerset County Cricket Club and Sussex County Cricket Club played on 2 September 1978 at Lord's in London. It was the sixteenth final of the Gillette Cup, {{which had been}} the first {{domestic}} tournament <b>to</b> <b>pit</b> first-class cricket sides against each other in a knock-out competition. This was Sussex's sixth appearance in the final, which they had previously won twice, while Somerset had lost in their only previous final.|$|E
5|$|The {{second session}} saw Hamilton post the fastest time, {{even though his}} car lost contact <b>to</b> <b>pit</b> lane and his seat {{overheating}} once more. He was three-tenths clear of his teammate Rosberg, with Sebastian Vettel in third. Daniil Kvyat suffered engine problems and failed {{to make it into}} Q3, as did the second Force India of Sergio Pérez, both Toro Rosso drivers and the Lotus of Pastor Maldonado.|$|E
50|$|Pitting can be {{initiated}} {{by a small}} surface defect, being a scratch or a local change in composition, or a damage to the protective coating. Polished surfaces display higher resistance <b>to</b> <b>pitting.</b>|$|R

50|$|Emboldened by {{the success}} of the initial line, the company decided to build a more ambitious line from the Llanelly Dock <b>to</b> <b>pits</b> further <b>to</b> the north-east. The company changed its name at this time to the Llanelly Railway and Dock Company, by Act of 21 August 1835. This second line, {{separate}} from the Dafen line, opened as far as Pontardulais in 1839, extending to Duffryn and Cwmamman on 6 May 1840. In the following two years an eastward extension <b>to</b> <b>pits</b> in the Amman Valley was opened, and in 1842 a westward branch to the Great Mountain (Mynydd Mawr) was constructed.|$|R
5|$|Waltrip {{took over}} the lead on lap 163, and an eighth caution was necessitated when Biffle made contact with Ragan, who hit Harvick, who spun heading into turn three but avoided hitting the {{barriers}} or other cars. Some drivers, including Waltrip, chose <b>to</b> <b>pit</b> for fresh tires and fuel during the caution. Montoya elected not <b>to</b> <b>pit,</b> and led the field at the restart on lap 169. The top six drivers quickly began {{to pull away from}} the rest of the field, as Stewart ran fourth and Harvick 16th by lap 172. Stewart and Montoya ran alongside each other at the line on lap 173, before Stewart moved in front for the lead one lap later. On the same lap, a second multi-car accident occurred necessitating a ninth caution when Edwards made contact with teammate Biffle going into turn three, and collected, Earnhardt, Harvick, Kyle Busch, Nemechek, Sorenson, Kenseth, Kvapil, Watrip, Dave Blaney and Montoya. The second red-flag of the race was shown shortly afterward to allow officials to clear debris from the track. The race was restarted twelve minutes later, as some drivers made pit stops.|$|E
5|$|When {{the rain}} started again, Vettel {{was one of}} the first <b>to</b> <b>pit</b> for intermediates, but since his radio had failed the team was not ready for him, causing a long delay. Ferrari timed Massa's pit stop well, letting Alonso take second {{position}} from him. Vettel took sixth position from Michael Schumacher which proved sufficient to retain the title even with Alonso finishing second.|$|E
5|$|Alonso {{held off}} Vettel to {{maintain}} his start line advantage on the first lap. Lewis Hamilton, who started third, fought off teammate Jenson Button to retain his start position. The top two remained the same through {{the first and only}} round of pit stops. Webber's team, Red Bull, opted <b>to</b> <b>pit</b> him early allowing him to move ahead of Hamilton. The race was neutralised by the deployment of the safety car after Kamui Kobayashi and Bruno Senna crashed on lap 31. Hamilton retired after a collision with Webber shortly after the race restarted on lap 36. Alonso maintained his lead throughout the remainder of the race despite pressure from Vettel.|$|E
30|$|The {{retrieved}} stirrups {{from the}} test beams, after testing, has revealed pitting corrosion which reduces area {{more at the}} lower bends of the stirrups. This localized reduction in area due <b>to</b> <b>pitting</b> is perhaps {{a major factor in}} the reduction of shear strength provided by the stirrups. As it is difficult to predict the reduction in area due <b>to</b> <b>pitting</b> corrosion, unlike uniform corrosion as assumed, and to develop exact mathematical formulations of all applicable corrosion damage factors, it appears an empirical approach that has experimental correlation is perhaps a better option for a strength prediction model.|$|R
