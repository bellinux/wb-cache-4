5|$|Christian {{meditation}} performed {{along with}} Eucharistic adoration outside of Mass {{has been associated}} with a large amount of Catholic writings and inspirations specially since the 18th century. <b>The</b> <b>Eucharistic</b> meditations of the two Saints Pierre Julien Eymard and Jean Vianney (both promoters of the Eucharist) were published as books.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ninth}} century, Hrabanus Maurus and Ratramnus also defended Augustine's view of non{{metabolic}} real presence. During {{the high and}} late Middle Ages, the metabolic view became increasingly dominant {{to the exclusion of}} the nonmetabolic view, {{to the point that it}} was considered the only orthodox option. The doctrine of transubstantiation was developed in the high Middle Ages to explain the change of the elements into Christ's body and blood. Transubstantiation is the belief that <b>the</b> <b>Eucharistic</b> elements are transformed into Christ's body and blood in a way only perceivable by the intellect, not by the senses.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Second <b>Eucharistic</b> Prayer is an {{abridgement}} of the Roman Canon {{with elements}} included from the Anaphora of the Apostolic Tradition, {{most notably in}} its proper preface and in the Epiclesis. <b>The</b> Third <b>Eucharistic</b> Prayer is a new composition, longer than <b>the</b> Second <b>Eucharistic</b> Prayer, and contains Alexandrian, Byzantine, and Maronite elements. Its structure follows the Roman Canon. It {{is based on the}} 4th-century Anaphora of St Basil. <b>The</b> fourth <b>Eucharistic</b> Prayer is roughly based upon the Anaphora of St Basil, with, among other things, the epiclesis moved before the Institution Narrative.|$|R

5|$|Peter Martyr Vermigli (8 September 149912 November 1562) was an Italian-born Reformed theologian. His {{early work}} as a {{reformer}} in Catholic medieval Italy and decision to flee for Protestant northern Europe influenced many other Italians to convert and flee as well. In England, he influenced the Edwardian Reformation, including <b>the</b> <b>Eucharistic</b> service of the 1552 Book of Common Prayer. He was considered an authority on the Eucharist among the Reformed churches, and engaged in controversies on the subject by writing treatises. Vermigli's Loci Communes, a compilation of excerpts from his biblical commentaries organized by the topics of systematic theology, became a standard Reformed theological textbook.|$|E
5|$|As {{the use of}} English in worship {{services}} spread, {{the need for a}} complete uniform liturgy for the Church became evident. Initial meetings to start what would eventually become the Book of Common Prayer were held in the former abbey of Chertsey and in Windsor Castle in September 1548. The list of participants can only be partially reconstructed, but it is known that the members were balanced between conservatives and reformers. These meetings were followed by a debate on the Eucharist in the House of Lords which took place between 14 and 19 December. Cranmer publicly revealed in this debate that he had abandoned the doctrine of the corporeal real presence and believed that <b>the</b> <b>Eucharistic</b> presence was only spiritual. Parliament backed the publication of the Prayer Book after Christmas by passing the Act of Uniformity 1549; it then legalized clerical marriage.|$|E

The north and south walls of the cella, as well as the wall piers, bear frescoes of saints, including rare images of military saints on horseback. Murals of Saint Petka and Saint Nicholas were painted in the upper reaches of the narthex, in the south and the north tower respectively.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} ways {{of knowing}} in <b>the</b> Anglican <b>eucharistic</b> tradition. It also explores the ramifications of these {{ways of knowing}} for theological education in the Anglican tradition of Christianity. The thesis uses Anglican eucharistic theology {{as a source of}} case study, and attempts, using a methodology of phenomenology to examine critically the particular interests and philosophical assumptions underlying <b>eucharistic</b> theology in <b>the</b> Anglican tradition {{from the time of the}} Reformation to the present day. Phenomenology is chosen as the methodology since it allows access to the diverse experience of <b>the</b> Anglican <b>eucharistic</b> tradition, suspending judgment until a later time when essences are extracted from the case studies. This has the potential to avoid exclusive commitments to particular technical and hermeneutic interests within Anglicanism while at the same time recognising the multiformity of <b>the</b> Anglican <b>eucharistic</b> tradition and fostering a critical approach to the examination of the experience of <b>the</b> Anglican <b>eucharistic</b> tradition and Anglican theological education. In examining ways of knowing in the Anglican tradition, the thesis acknowledges <b>the</b> usefulness for <b>eucharistic</b> theology and theological education of philosophical enquiry. The three ways of knowing (technical, hermeneutic and critical) proposed by the philosopher, Jurgen Habermas (1971 and 1973) are used to assist in understanding the knowledge of <b>the</b> Anglican <b>eucharistic</b> tradition presented in the case studies. The further insights of Habermas (1984 and 1989) are used in recommending a dialogue approach, based on the intersubjectivity of communicative action, for theological education concerned with <b>the</b> teaching of <b>eucharistic</b> theology in <b>the</b> Anglican tradition. Philosophical reflection is also employed in an examination of the underlying philosophical assumptions of the case studies of <b>eucharistic</b> theology in <b>the</b> Anglican tradition. A model of <b>the</b> Anglican <b>eucharistic</b> tradition based on the philosophical concepts of realism and nominalism, to both the moderate and immoderate degrees is developed and proposed as a way of promoting a critical interest in <b>the</b> Anglican <b>eucharistic</b> tradition beyond <b>the</b> merely technical or hermeneutic interests commonly found in various church parties of the Anglican Communion. The work of the Australian philosopher David Armstrong (1989, 1995, 1997 and 2004) is foundational to the development of a model for <b>the</b> Anglican <b>eucharistic</b> tradition and <b>the</b> examination of its experience in the case studies. The principal findings of the study suggest that the prevailing essence of <b>the</b> Anglican <b>eucharistic</b> tradition is a multiformity of eucharistic doctrine, such that eucharistic theology is most often expressed using the philosophical assumptions of realism and nominalism to the moderate degree and according to varying technical and hermeneutic interests. The thesis also seeks to draw out the educational implications of these differing ways of knowing for theological education in the Anglican tradition and specifically for <b>the</b> teaching of <b>eucharistic</b> theology. <b>The</b> principal recommendation of the thesis for theological education is the application of a dialogue approach in <b>the</b> teaching of <b>eucharistic</b> theology in Anglican theological education, where dialogue involves the development of an ideal communicative community in which participants seek shared meaning on the basis of the intersubjectivity of communicative action.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Eucharistic</b> celebration, {{also called}} the Mass or Divine liturgy, {{includes}} prayers and scriptural readings, {{as well as an}} offering of bread and wine, which are brought to the altar and consecrated by the priest to become the body and the blood of Jesus Christ, a change called transubstantiation. The words of consecration reflect the words spoken by Jesus during the Last Supper, where Christ offered his body and blood to his Apostles the night before his crucifixion. The sacrament re-presents (makes present) the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, and perpetuates it. Christ's death and resurrection gives grace through the sacrament that unites the faithful with Christ and one another, remits venial sin, and aids against committing moral sin (though mortal sin itself is forgiven through the sacrament of penance).|$|E
5|$|Calvin's {{theology}} caused controversy. Pierre Caroli, a Protestant {{minister in}} Lausanne accused Calvin {{as well as}} Viret and Farel of Arianism in 1536. Calvin defended his beliefs on the Trinity in Confessio de Trinitate propter calumnias P. Caroli. In 1551 JÃ©rÃ´me-HermÃ¨s Bolsec, a physician in Geneva, attacked Calvin's doctrine of predestination and accused him of making God the author of sin. Bolsec was banished from the city, and after Calvin's death, he wrote a biography which severely maligned Calvin's character. In the following year, Joachim Westphal, a Gnesio-Lutheran pastor in Hamburg, condemned Calvin and Zwingli as heretics in denying <b>the</b> <b>eucharistic</b> doctrine of the union of Christ's body with the elements. Calvin's Defensio sanae et orthodoxae doctrinae de sacramentis (A Defence of the Sober and Orthodox Doctrine of the Sacrament) was his response in 1555. In 1556 , a Dutch dissident, held a public disputation with Calvin {{during his visit to}} Frankfurt, in which Velsius defended free will against Calvin's doctrine of predestination. Following the execution of Servetus, a close associate of Calvin, Sebastian Castellio, broke with him {{on the issue of the}} treatment of heretics. In Castellio's Treatise on Heretics (1554), he argued for a focus on Christ's moral teachings in place of the vanity of theology, and he afterward developed a theory of tolerance based on biblical principles.|$|E

Such a process has potential to emancipate <b>the</b> Anglican <b>eucharistic</b> tradition from conflict and centre attention on a more critical self-reflection on the discourse of <b>the</b> tradition. <b>Eucharistic</b> liturgies in use in Australia are considered in terms of their underlying philosophical assumptions, and recommendations are made for the use of a dialogue approach based on Habermasâ€™s theory of communicative action...|$|R
