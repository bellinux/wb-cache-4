50|$|Squeeze bore guns {{saw only}} limited use in World War II. Manufacturing such weapons was {{impossible}} without advanced technologies and high production standards. Besides Germany, {{the only country}} to bring such weapons to mass production was Britain, with the Littlejohn adaptor which, although not a gun in itself, used the same principle. An attempt by a Soviet design bureau headed by V. G. Grabin in 1940, failed because of technological problems. In the US, reports about the sPzB 41 inspired a series of experiments with 28/20 barrels and <b>taper</b> <b>bore</b> adaptors for the 37 mm Gun M3; the work started in September 1941 and continued throughout the war, with no practical success.|$|E
40|$|Mechanical tests {{performed}} on small bone specimens such a single trabecula remain challenging because their isolation, fixation, and precise loading are complicated. Hence, we describe a novel experimental method {{to measure the}} elastic properties of a single trabecula using micro-cantilever bending (MCB) testing. The method does not require specimens to be completely separated from the cancellous bone, and the specimen can be easily fixed during the test. In total, 10 trabecular specimens taken from the proximal epiphysis of an adult bovine femur {{were used in the}} present study. Measurements were conducted using a small testing device comprising a 1 -axial stage, load cell, optical microscope, and small plate with a <b>taper</b> <b>bore</b> for applying load {{at the edge of the}} specimen. Each specimen was positioned at the edge of the bore and was deformed by displacing the stage. The deflection of the specimen was observed by optical microscopy. The elastic modulus of the specimen was calculated on the basis of the force-deflection relationship, assuming that the shape of the specimen was a vertical circular cylinder. As a result, an average elastic modulus of 9. 1 +/- 5. 4 GPa was obtained for a single trabecula, including the values in literature. Thus, the MCB test is a novel simple method for biomechanical analysis of a single trabecula...|$|E

The initial design used Rayleigh step hydrodynamic lift pads to assist in centering the seal ring with minimum rubbing contact. The final design used a convergent <b>tapered</b> <b>bore</b> to provide hydrostatic centering force. The Rayleigh step design was tested for 107 starts and 4. 52 hours total. The leakage was satisfactory; however, the design was not acceptable due to excessive wear caused by inadequate centering force and failure of the sealing dam caused by erosion damage. The <b>tapered</b> <b>bore</b> design was tested for 370 starts and 15. 93 hours total. Satisfactory performance for the required life of 7. 5 hours per seal was successfully demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} geometry plasto-hydrodynamic {{pressure unit}} {{has been investigated}} theoretically and experimentally. Previous investigators have used either stepped parallel or <b>tapered</b> <b>bore</b> pressure unit for die-less drawing and/or coating of wires, tubes and stripes. In the present study a combined parallel and <b>tapered</b> <b>bore</b> unit {{has been used in}} conjunction with polymer melts as pressure fluid. In this present work a pressure unit is heated to convert the polymer feed into a viscous melt and the pressure in the fluid is generated by hydrodynamic action when a wire is drawn through it. Experimental work has been carried out on different pressure units with similar external but different internal geometries to investigate the performance of new pressure unit. Different types of polymer were used as the pressure medium. In this work analytical models based on Newtonian and pseudo-Newtonian characteristics have been developed to investigate the performance of the pressure unit and to optimise the process. The predicted results showed reasonable agreement those observed experimentally in magnitudes of maximum pressure. Experimental and theoretical results, showed that there exists a gap ratio (optimum) for which the pressure is maximum. For greater or smaller values of the gap ratio than the optimum value, a decreased magnitude for the maximum pressure was obtained. The maximum pressure at that gap ratio(optimum) is much higher compared to those obtained using either stepped or <b>tapered</b> <b>bore</b> pressure unit at similar conditions...|$|R
40|$|In plasto-hydrodynamic die-less {{wire drawing}} process, the {{conventional}} reduction die {{is replaced by}} a pressure unit of certain internal geometry. The deformation is induced by the combined effect of hydro-dynamic pressure and stress generated in the unit due to the motion of the wire and the viscous action of the polymer melt. The dimensions of the unit are such that the smallest bore size is greater than the incoming wire diameter. In this system, larger magnitude of the hydro-dynamic pressure is advantageous in obtaining greater deformation. In the present study, theoretical models have been developed for both the combined parallel and tapered geometry and simple <b>taper</b> <b>bore</b> pressure units, assuming non-Newtonian characteristics of the pressure medium, which enabled prediction of the maximum pressure and drawing stress, which gives better indication about the unit and it’s performance. The pressure and the viscosity coefficients were derived from the available data in the literature. Experimental work was undertaken with borosiloxane polymer at 110 °C melt temperature and using combined geometry and simple tapered bore pressure units. A number of parameters in terms of gap ratios and wire materials were changed for drawing speed of up to 0. 7 m/sec. The whole work was mainly devoted to assessing the performance of the unit and to establish the way it is affected by the unit geometry, the drawing speed, the working temperature. The optimum working dimensions were investigated and the theoretical results seem to be reasonably close to the experimental ones...|$|E

50|$|The {{evolution}} of the Renaissance recorder into the Baroque instrument is generally attributed to the Hotteterre family, in France. They developed the ideas of a more <b>tapered</b> <b>bore,</b> bringing the finger-holes of the lowermost hand closer together, allowing greater range, and enabling the construction of instruments in several jointed sections.

50|$|The typical MORGOIL tapered {{neck bearing}} {{assembly}} {{consists of a}} sleeve with a non-locking <b>tapered</b> <b>bore</b> that facilitates removal of the bearing chock assembly from the roll neck. The sleeve, keyed to the neck to prevent creeping during operation, produces a slight interference fit on the roll neck {{by means of the}} push-up force used to mount the bearing on the roll. The outside diameter of the sleeve is ground and polished serving as the journal surface of the bearing. Sleeve wall thickness variation is controlled to 0.005 mm (0.0002 in.) to minimize roll force variation.|$|R
5000|$|A lapping {{process known}} as [...] "fire lapping" [...] uses a lead [...] "slug" [...] that is {{slightly}} larger than the bore and covered in fine abrasive compound to cut out the constrictions. The slug is passed from breech to muzzle, so that as it encounters constrictions, it cuts them away, and does no cutting on areas that are larger than the constriction. Many passes are made, and as the bore becomes more uniform, finer grades of abrasive compound are used. The final result is a barrel that is mirror-smooth, and with a consistent or slightly <b>tapering</b> <b>bore.</b> The hand-lapping technique uses a wooden or soft metal rod to pull or push the slug through the bore, while the newer fire-lapping technique uses specially loaded, low-power cartridges to push abrasive-covered soft-lead bullets down the barrel.|$|R

The loop is mounted on a cylinder that is slit longitudinally at regular intervals around its circumference. Strain is applied by forcing a conical plug into the <b>tapered</b> <b>bore</b> of the cylinder which expands evenly as a consequence. The strain is measured by a strain gauge glued {{to the surface of}} the tape. The advantage of this configuration is that it enables insertion in the small bores of the highest field superconducting magnets and thus permits access to fields levels not easily available in more traditional linear pulling devices. Also the loop configuration is more representative of the coil geometry encountered in magnet applications. Representative data are presented and discussed critically...|$|R
50|$|The saxhorns {{constitute}} {{a family of}} brass instruments with <b>tapered</b> <b>bores.</b> Pitched in eight alternating sizes in E-flat and B-flat, like saxophones, they were originally designed for army use and revolutionized military and brass bands in Europe and America. Developed during the 1840s and 50s, the saxhorn was first patented in Paris in 1845 by Adolphe Sax, though the validity of his patents was challenged by rival instrument makers during his lifetime. Throughout the mid-1850s, he continued to experiment with the instrument's valve pattern. Later makers, particularly in America, altered the scale and designs sometimes {{to such an extent}} as to make it difficult to determine whether the larger sizes of the resulting instruments actually have descended from the saxhorn or the tuba. The tenor and baritone horns, amongst other sizes of instruments used in British brass bands, are members of the saxhorn family.|$|R
5|$|The fixed {{reed and}} fairly uniform {{diameter}} of the clarinet give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical stopped pipe. Recorders use a <b>tapered</b> internal <b>bore</b> to overblow at the octave when the thumb/register hole is pinched open, while the clarinet, with its cylindrical bore, overblows at the 12th. Adjusting {{the angle of the}} <b>bore</b> <b>taper</b> controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (harmonics). Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes aspects of the harmonic timbre or voice of the clarinet because this changes the speed of reed vibrations. Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of the reed vibrate as possible, making the sound fuller, warmer, and potentially louder.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} {{parts of}} a MORGOIL Bearing are relatively uncomplicated. The Sleeve is an alloy steel forging, heat-treated and ground to a fine finish. The Sleeve has a precision non-locking <b>tapered</b> <b>bore,</b> which fits on, and is keyed to, the tapered Roll Neck, thus becoming the bearing journal. Surrounding the Sleeve is the Bushing, fixed in the Chock, which carries the radial load. The precision Sleeve rotating in the bushing on an unbroken film of oil provides a Bearing with a low coefficient of friction, low power consumption, high load capacity, high stiffness, and freedom from wear and fatigue. Adjacent to the outbound end of the sleeve is the Thrust Bearing, which is typically a double acting roller (or ball bearing in some applications {{depending on the size}} of the radial bearing). The Thrust Bearing is mounted in such a manner that it only carries the thrust load and is not subject to any radial loading.|$|R

40|$|Even if the tuning {{between the}} first and second {{register}} of a clarinet has been optimized by instrument makers, the lowest twelfths remain slightly too large (inharmonicity). In this article, we study the problem from two different points of view. First, we systematically review various physical reasons why this inharmonicity may take place, and the effect of different bore perturbations inserted in cylindrical instruments. Applications to a real clarinet resonator and comparisons with impedance measurements are then presented. A commonly accepted idea is that the register hole is the dominant cause for this inharmonicity: it is natural to expect that opening this hole will raise the resonance frequencies of the instrument, except for the note for which the hole is at the pressure node. We show that the real situation is actually more complicated because other effects, such as open holes or <b>bore</b> <b>taper</b> and bell, introduce resonance shifts that are comparable but with opposite sign, so that a relatively good overall compensation takes place. The origin of the observed inharmonicity in playing frequencies is therefore different. In a second part, we use an elementary model of the clarinet in order to isolate the effect of the register hole: a perfect cylindrical tube without closed holes. Optimization techniques are then used to calculate an optimum location for the register hole; the result turns out to be close to the location chosen by clarinet makers. Finally, attempts are made numerically to improve the situation by introducing small perturbations in the higher part of the cylindrical resonator, but no satisfactory improvement is obtained.
