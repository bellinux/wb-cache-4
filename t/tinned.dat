5|$|Bog turtles are {{omnivorous}} and eat {{aquatic plants}} (such as duckweed), seeds, berries, earthworms, snails, slugs, insects, other invertebrates, frogs, {{and other small}} vertebrates. They also occasionally eat carrion. Invertebrates such as insects are generally the most important food item. In captivity, a bog turtle can be fed a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as meat such as liver, chicken hearts, and <b>tinned</b> dog food. Bog turtles feed only during the day, but rarely during the hottest hours, consuming their food on land or in the water.|$|E
5|$|The {{helmet and}} visor were cast from an alloy {{consisting}} {{of an average}} of 82% copper, 10% zinc and 8% tin. This alloy was probably derived from melted-down scrap brass with a low zinc content, with which some tin had been added {{to improve the quality}} of the casting. Some of the fragments show traces of a white metal coating, indicating that the visor would originally have been <b>tinned</b> to give the appearance of silver. The griffin was cast separately from a different alloy consisting of 68% copper, 4% zinc, 18% tin and 10% lead. The visor would originally have been a silver hue and the helmet would have had a coppery yellow appearance. The helmet's creation can be dated to the late 2nd or early 3rd century from the use of a particular type of decorated rivet as well as some of its design features, such as its pierced eyes.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by Owen Beattie, a professor of anthropology at the University of Alberta, began a series of scientific studies of the graves, bodies, and other physical evidence left by Franklin's men on Beechey Island and King William Island. They concluded that the men buried on Beechey Island most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis, and that lead poisoning may have worsened their health, owing to badly soldered cans held in the ships' food stores. However, it was later suggested that the source of this lead may not have been <b>tinned</b> food, but the distilled water systems fitted to the ships. Cut marks on human bones found on King William Island were seen as signs of cannibalism. The combined evidence of all studies suggested that the crewmen did not all die quickly. Hypothermia, starvation, lead poisoning and diseases including scurvy, along with general exposure to a hostile environment whilst lacking adequate clothing and nutrition, killed everyone on the expedition in the years following its last sighting by Europeans in 1845.|$|E

25|$|The {{individual}} scales (squamae) {{were either}} iron or bronze, or even alternating metals {{on the same}} shirt. They could be <b>tinned</b> as well, one surviving fragment showing bronze scales that were alternately <b>tinned</b> and plain. The metal was generally not very thick, 0.5mm to 0.8mm (0.02 to 0.032 in) perhaps being a common range. Since the scales overlapped in every direction, however, the multiple layers gave good protection. The size ranged from as small as 6mm (0.25in) wide by 1.2cm tall up to about 5cm (2in) wide by 8cm (3in) tall, with the most common sizes being roughly 1.25 by 2.5cm (0.5 by 1 in). Many had rounded bottoms, while others were pointed or had flat bottoms with the corners clipped off at an angle. The scales could be flat, slightly domed, or have a raised midrib or edge. All the scales in a shirt were generally of the same size; however, scales from different shirts varied significantly.|$|E

Rin <b>Tin</b> <b>Tin</b> III, said to be Rin <b>Tin</b> Tin's grandson, but probably only distantly related, helped promote the military use of dogs during World War II.

25|$|In August 2014 Akhmetov's Foundation for Development of Ukraine {{also started}} a new {{particular}} project called Humanitarian Aid Drives. The purpose of this project is the regular delivery of food and children’s packages to Donbass.

The package includes flour, sugar, cereals, oats, <b>tinned</b> foods, sunflower oil, stew, pasta, canned corn, gingerbreads and condensed milk.|$|E
25|$|Metal pots {{are made}} from a narrow range of metals because pots and pans need to conduct heat well, but {{also need to be}} {{chemically}} unreactive so that they do not alter the flavor of the food. Most materials that are conductive enough to heat evenly are too reactive to use in food preparation. In some cases (copper pots, for example), a pot may be made out of a more reactive metal, and then <b>tinned</b> or clad with another.|$|E
25|$|ICT {{appears to}} be {{vanishing}} {{as a result of}} greater genetic diversity within the affected populations in conjunction with educational programs to ensure that <b>tinned</b> cooking utensils are used instead of copper pots and pans being directly exposed to cooked foods.

5000|$|After Duncan died in 1960, {{the screen}} {{property}} of Rin <b>Tin</b> <b>Tin</b> passed to TV producer Herbert B.

After Leonard died in 2006, Leonard's lawyer James Tierney made the 2007 film Finding Rin <b>Tin</b> <b>Tin,</b> an American-Bulgarian production based on Duncan's discovery of the dog in France. Meanwhile, a Rin <b>Tin</b> <b>Tin</b> memorabilia collection was being amassed by Texas resident Jannettia Propps Brodsgaard, who had purchased several direct descendant dogs from Duncan beginning with Rinty <b>Tin</b> <b>Tin</b> Brodsgaard in 1957. Brodsgaard bred the dogs to keep the bloodline. Brodsgaard's granddaughter, Daphne Hereford, continued {{to build on the}} tradition and bloodline of Rin <b>Tin</b> <b>Tin</b> from 1988 to 2011; she was the first to trademark the name Rin <b>Tin</b> <b>Tin</b> in 1993 (Duncan had never done so) and she bought the domain names rintintin.com and rintintin.net to establish a website. Hereford also opened a short-lived Rin <b>Tin</b> <b>Tin</b> museum in Latexo, Texas. Hereford passed the tradition to her daughter, Dorothy Yanchak, in 2011. The current Rin <b>Tin</b> <b>Tin</b> XII dog owned by Yanchak takes part in public events to represent the Rin <b>Tin</b> <b>Tin</b> legacy.|$|R

There was no opposition, although one Japanese straggler was killed. They found food, clothing and ammunition, and, in the latrines, evidence of dysentery among the Japanese troops. D Company had Japanese rice and <b>tinned</b> fish for its evening meal.|$|E
25|$|In the Royal Navy's Arctic expeditions in the 19th century it {{was widely}} {{believed}} that scurvy was prevented by good hygiene on board ship, regular exercise, and maintaining {{the morale of the}} crew, rather than by a diet of fresh food. Navy expeditions continued to be plagued by scurvy even while fresh (not jerked or <b>tinned)</b> meat was well known as a practical antiscorbutic among civilian whalers and explorers in the Arctic. Even cooking fresh meat did not entirely destroy its antiscorbutic properties, especially as many cooking methods failed to bring all the meat to high temperature.|$|E
