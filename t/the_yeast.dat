40|$|During {{the last}} two decades it has been {{demonstrated}} many times that populations of leaf surface micro-organisms are capable of reducing the levels of disease caused by various fungal pathogens. The various mechanisms by which this may be achieved have been studied and reported. In many cases, the disease depressing interactions are effective in depressing germination of spores of pathogens, in causing lysis of germtubes or in hyperparasitising the pathogen. This work is reviewed. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine how <b>the</b> leaf-colonising <b>yeasts,</b> Cryptococcus laurentii var. flavescens and Sporobolomyces roseus reduced the infection of maize by the anthracnose fungus, Colletotrichum graminicola. Initial experiments did not support the hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>yeasts</b> suppressed germination, nor did they demonstrate an effect of <b>the</b> <b>yeasts</b> on appressorium production. Experiments on attached leaves, however, provided data which showed that maize leaves inoculated with equal inocula in the presence and absence of <b>the</b> <b>yeasts</b> produced many more infection courts than with yeasts. This suggested, since there were equal numbers of appressorium on each set of leaves, that appressorium behaviour was different in <b>the</b> presence of <b>yeasts</b> from in their absence. In further experiments, using different techniques, it was found that in the presence of <b>the</b> <b>yeasts,</b> <b>the</b> proportion of appressoria which germinated was reduced.
