5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1958, Nasser formed a {{tripartite}} committee consisting of Zakaria Mohieddin, al-Hawrani, and Salah Bitar to oversee developments in Syria. By moving the latter two, who were Ba'athists, to Cairo, he neutralized important political figures who had <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas</b> about how Syria should be run. He put Syria under Sarraj, who effectively reduced the province to a police state by imprisoning and exiling landholders who objected {{to the introduction of}} Egyptian agricultural reform in Syria, as well as communists. Following the Lebanese election of Fuad Chehab in September 1958, relations between Lebanon and the UAR improved considerably. On 25 March 1959, Chehab and Nasser met at the Lebanese–Syrian border and compromised on an end to the Lebanese crisis.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its strong}} sales, Final Fantasy XIII had been criticized on several fronts. Complaints {{included}} {{that the game}} had been too linear, had not allowed enough interaction with non-player characters, and had not featured enough minigames and puzzles. The developers intended to address these criticisms with the sequel by adding the Historia Crux system, numerous sidequests from non-player characters, and the casino minigame area. Environments were made more explorable and the artists were given more freedom to include <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas</b> in the game's locations, in order to rectify the shortcomings of the more artificial seeming settings in Final Fantasy XIII. Although the developers were explicitly responding to the criticism, they saw the changes and additions as making the sequel {{in line with what}} players had hoped Final Fantasy XIII would be, rather than backing away from the changes that game had brought to the series. For the structure of side quests and some other aspects such as the abundance of chocobos and the more open environment, the team drew inspiration from Rockstar San Diego's Red Dead Redemption. The game also included multiple endings, which Toriyama referred to as a first for the series.|$|E
5|$|Development of Silent Hill {{started in}} September 1996. The game {{was created by}} Team Silent, a group of staff members within the Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo studio. The new owners of its parent company Konami sought to produce a game that would be {{successful}} in the United States. For this reason, a Hollywood-like atmosphere was proposed for Silent Hill. The staff members that were assigned to the game's development had failed at their previous projects. They intended to leave Konami, as they were not allowed to realize <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas,</b> and were not compatible with the company's other teams. According to composer Akira Yamaoka, the developers {{did not know how to}} proceed with the Silent Hill project, either. As the time passed, the personnel and management of Konami lost their faith in the game, and the members of Team Silent increasingly felt like outsiders. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, however, the developers of Silent Hill had much artistic freedom because the game was still produced as in the era of lower-budget 2D titles. Eventually, the development staff decided to ignore the limits of Konami's initial plan, and to make Silent Hill a game that would appeal to the emotions of players instead.|$|E
5|$|Laser {{remained}} in character as Heiter throughout the filming process, often shouting {{at the rest}} of the cast on set, but wherever possible staying away from the other actors and crew between scenes to preserve a level of separation. He only ate food he had brought onto the set himself, eating mostly fruit. He contributed dialogue for his character and selected many of his character's outfits from his personal wardrobe. Six claims that the jacket Heiter wore, which was bought by Laser, was a genuine jacket worn by real Nazi doctors. Laser was also happy for the other actors in The Human Centipede to add <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas</b> to the film. For example, when Heiter is explaining his procedure to his victims, Katsuro's dialogue was improvised, which pleased Laser. During filming Laser accidentally kicked Kitamura (Katsuro), leading to a fight on set between the actors. The incident contributed to the tension and anger throughout the scene they were filming, in which Heiter sits at his dining table eating while the centipede eats dog food from the floor alongside him. Laser also hurt Williams during the scene when Heiter roughly grabs and injects Lindsay, which caused a pause in shooting before the filmmakers could continue.|$|E

25|$|The Fehr Round Barn {{illustrates}} {{the evolution of}} round barn design, especially in the Stephenson County area. The barn {{was the first in}} the area to be built with a hip roof. This roof style set the structure's design apart from the typical round barn designed based on recommendations from the University of Illinois' and the University of Wisconsin–Madison's Agricultural Experiment Stations. The building represents the ability of local builders and designers to create <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas</b> without the station's influence. The Fehr Round Barn was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1984 as part of a Multiple Property Submission.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, {{immediately}} after the recording of Unconditionally Guaranteed, which markedly continued the trend towards a more commercial sound heard {{on some of the}} Clear Spot tracks, the Magic Band's original members departed. Disgruntled and past members worked together for a period, gigging at Blue Lake and putting together <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas</b> and demos, with John French earmarked as the vocalist. These concepts eventually coalesced around the core of Art Tripp III, Harkleroad and Boston, with the formation of Mallard, helped by finance and UK recording facilities from Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson. Some of French's compositions were used in the band's work, but the group's singer was Sam Galpin and the role of keyboardist was eventually taken by John Thomas, who had shared a house with French in Eureka at the time. At this time Vliet attempted to recruit both French and Harkleroad as producers for his next album, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. Andy Di Martino produced both of these Virgin label albums.|$|E

25|$|Public lecture courses {{offered some}} {{scientists}} who were unaffiliated with official organizations a forum to transmit scientific knowledge, at times even <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas,</b> {{and the opportunity}} to carve out a reputation and, in some instances, a living. The public, on the other hand, gained both knowledge and entertainment from demonstration lectures. Between 1735 and 1793, there were over seventy individuals offering courses and demonstrations for public viewers in experimental physics. Class sizes ranged from one hundred to four or five hundred attendees. Courses varied in duration from one to four weeks, to a few months, or even the entire academic year. Courses were offered at virtually any time of day; the latest occurred at 8:00 or 9:00 at night. One of the most popular start times was 6:00 pm, allowing the working population to participate and signifying the attendance of the nonelite. Barred from the universities and other institutions, women were often in attendance at demonstration lectures and constituted a significant number of auditors.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of a Vril-Society was alleged in 1960 by Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels. In their book The Morning of the Magicians, they claimed that the Vril-Society was a secret community of occultists in pre-Nazi Berlin that {{was a sort of}} inner circle of the Thule Society. They also thought that it was in close contact with the English group known as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Vril information takes up about a tenth of the volume, the remainder of which details other esoteric speculations, but the authors fail to clearly explain whether this section is fact or fiction. Historians have shown that there has been no actual historical foundation for the claims of Pauwels and Bergier, and that the article of Willy Ley has only been a vague inspiration for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas.</b> Nevertheless, Pauwels and Bergier have influenced a whole new literary genre dealing with the alleged occult influences on National Socialism which have often been related to the fictional Vril Society.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards, Kamikokuryo {{worked as}} art {{director}} on Final Fantasy XIII-2. As {{he felt that}} the tone of the story was much darker than that of its predecessor, he decided on surrealism as the main theme for the visuals. The works of Salvador Dalí and Giorgio de Chirico were used as references and helped Kamikokuryo strike a balance between photorealism and fantasy-like surrealism. Unlike Final Fantasy XIII, the game had a much tighter schedule allowing for little pre-production. Kamikokuryo hence used photographs instead of self-drawn pictures to explain his setting ideas to the other staff members. For example, a photograph of ruined buildings in the Cuban capital Havana inspired the look of Valhalla, the afterlife of Final Fantasy XIII-2. Kamikokuryo gave his artists more freedom to include <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas</b> in the game's locations, intending to rectify the shortcomings of the more artificial seeming settings in Final Fantasy XIII. In addition to adjusting models, camera angles and lighting effects, he also drew {{the final version of the}} character Lightning based on a silhouette sketch by Tetsuya Nomura. Kamikokuryo's first character design, he received suggestions from Nomura and finished Lightning's costume in one to two months.|$|E

25|$|Kersal {{remained}} {{a rural area}} until about 1840 when the Clowes family, who owned {{most of the land}} in the area, began to sell it off for development, and merchants and manufacturers began to build their mansions in the green fields of Higher Broughton and Kersal. In keeping with <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas</b> of social engineering they imposed strict covenants on how the land was used, reserving the higher ground for more well-to-do residents and the lower ground for workers' cottages. The number of public houses was severely restricted and then, only beer houses that didn't sell spirits were allowed. Singleton Road and Moor Lane were the only roads connecting Bury Old Road and Bolton Road and there was a toll bar on the corner of Bury Old Road. When Bury New Road was built in 1831 a gate or bar was erected and travellers had to pay a toll to the turnpike trust to pass through. A toll house was erected on Bury New Road with a bay window projecting out so that the toll collector had {{a clear view of the}} road. By 1848 the local authority had taken over the road, the tolls were abolished and the toll collector's house became a newsagent's. This was the only shop in an area where the landowner's restrictive covenants prevented commercial development. The exterior of the house remains largely unchanged to this day, although it was renovated in 2007 with a two-storey extension being added to the rear. The Toll House is now a Grade II listed building.|$|E
