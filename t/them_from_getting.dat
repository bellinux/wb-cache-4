25|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Benedicto Lucas Garcia, what had begun as a campaign of selective repression targeting specific sectors of Guatemalan society began to metamorphose into a policy of extermination. Wholesale massacres of Mayan communities became commonplace, in what was perceived {{at the time as}} a marked change in strategy. In some communities of the region's military forced all residents to leave their homes and concentrate in the county seat under military control. Some families obeyed; others took refuge in the mountains. K'iche's who took refuge in the mountains, were identified by the Army with the guerrillas and underwent a military siege, and continuous attacks that prevented <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> food, shelter and medical care.

He also had closing ports and destroying ships in Javanese coastal cities to prevent <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> too powerful from their wealth. This action devastated Javanese coastal economy and has crippled Javanese maritime prowess that has been nurtured since Singhasari and Majapahit era, thus making Mataram mainly as an agricultural inland kingdom for centuries to come.

Despite his political ruthlessness, unlike his father, Amangkurat I was not an accomplished military leader and dare not to pursue confrontation against the Dutch, as in 1646 he signed peace agreement with them. To further his glory, the new king abandoned Karta, Sultan Agung’s capital, {{and moved to a}} grander red-brick palace in Plered (formerly the palace was built of wood).|$|E

After three to six weeks, he travels to a pond and the eggs hatch into tadpoles. The tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs from predation. The foam is made from proteins and lectins, and seems to have antimicrobial properties. Several pairs of frogs may form a colonial nest on a previously built raft. The eggs are laid in the centre, followed by [...] alternate layers of foam and eggs, finishing with a foam capping.|$|E

40|$|Children {{are among}} the most {{frequent}} and important users of Internet. The children can search any type of data in any digital forms in the digital libraries, web directories, or in many other media repositories. However, one possible limitation of searching these digital artifacts is that the young children have great difficulty in writing, spelling, and explaining their ideas during Internet search (lack of query formulation); this will limit expressing their intention. Language of the Internet are English, thus imposes problem for non-native children. In addition, miss-annotation of images on the Internet could expose children to porno images and sites. Thus, this paper reviews existing search engines for children and proposes a new concept to unify and for easy searching designed for children of various languages by using image search instead of keyword search.

[...] He noticed an unexpected interaction between the blood of a patient with hemophilia that had received multiple transfusions and a protein found in the blood of an Australian aborigine.

[...] He found a higher prevalence of the protein in the blood of patients from developing countries, compared to those from developed ones, and noted associations of the antigen with other diseases like leukemia and Down Syndrome. [...] Eventually, he came to the unifying conclusion that the Australia antigen was associated with viral hepatitis. [...] In 1970, David Dane first isolated the hepatitis B virion at London's Middlesex Hospital, and named the virion the 42-nm [...] "Dane particle". [...] Based on its association with the surface of the hepatitis B virus, the Australia antigen was renamed to [...] "hepatitis B surface antigen" [...] or HBsAg.
