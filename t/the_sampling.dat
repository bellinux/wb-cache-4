As Rosetta only tries to predict the final folded state, and not how folding proceeds, Rosetta@home and Folding@home are complementary and address very different molecular questions.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, Stella North was at {{the centre}} of a legal case in which three men were found guilty of {{conspiracy}} to defraud after {{trying to sell the}} CEGB poor quality coal when contracted to deliver high quality coal. The three men involved were D.C.P. Brooksbank, a salesman for a coal firm; J.W. Patterson, a sampler at the power station, and M. Ridley, a contractor. Their scheme was for Patterson to substitute samples of reasonably good coal for the samples of poor coal taken from the lorries. However they were found out only two days after starting the scheme, when a foreman at the station saw Patterson dropping a bag of cement into <b>the</b> <b>sampling</b> bin, and reported the incident.

25|$|The {{application}} of <b>the</b> <b>sampling</b> theorem to images {{should be made}} with care. For example, <b>the</b> <b>sampling</b> process in any standard image sensor (CCD or CMOS camera) is relatively far from the ideal sampling which would measure the image intensity at a single point. Instead these devices have a relatively large sensor area at each sample point {{in order to obtain}} sufficient amount of light. In other words, any detector has a finite-width point spread function. The analog optical image intensity function which is sampled by the sensor device is not in general bandlimited, and the non-ideal sampling is itself a useful type of low-pass filter, though not always sufficient to remove enough high frequencies to sufficiently reduce aliasing. When the area of <b>the</b> <b>sampling</b> spot (the size of the pixel sensor) is not large enough to provide sufficient spatial anti-aliasing, a separate anti-aliasing filter (optical low-pass filter) is typically included in a camera system to further blur the optical image. Despite images having these problems in relation to <b>the</b> <b>sampling</b> theorem, the theorem can be used to describe the basics of down and up sampling of images.|$|E
25|$|Exactly how, when, or why Harry Nyquist had {{his name}} {{attached}} to <b>the</b> <b>sampling</b> theorem remains obscure.

25|$|How <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> and matrix is {{deposited}} {{on the surface}} of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> probe needs to be a consideration in sample preparation as well. The dried drop method is the simplest of deposition methods. <b>The</b> matrix and <b>sample</b> solution are mixed together and then a small drop of the mixture is placed on <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> probe surface and allowed to dry, thus crystallizing. The sandwich method involves depositing a layer of matrix onto the surface of the probe and allowing it to dry. A drop of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> followed by a drop of additional matrix is then applied to the layer of dried matrix and allowed to dry as well. Variations on the sandwich technique involve depositing the matrix on the surface and then depositing <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> directly on top of the matrix. A particularly useful method involves depositing the matrix solution {{on the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> probe in a solvent that will evaporate very rapidly, thus forming a very thin fine layer of matrix. <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> solution is then placed on top of the matrix layer and allowed to evaporate slowly, thus integrating <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> into <b>the</b> top layer of matrix as <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> solution evaporates. An addition concern when depositing <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> on <b>the</b> surface of the probe is the solubility of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> in <b>the</b> matrix. If <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> is insoluble in the matrix, additional methods must be employed. A method used in this case involves mechanical grinding and mixing of solid sample and solid matrix crystals. Once blended well, this powder can be {{deposited on}} the surface of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> probe in free powder form or as a pill. Another possible method is placing <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> on <b>the</b> surface of the probe and applying vaporized matrix to <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> probe to allow the matrix to condense around <b>the</b> <b>sample.</b>|$|R

Grayscale images, for example, are often represented as two-dimensional arrays (or matrices) of real numbers representing the relative intensities of pixels (picture elements) located at the intersections of row and column sample locations. As a result, images require two independent variables, or indices, to specify each pixel uniquely—one for the row, {{and one for the}} column.|$|E
