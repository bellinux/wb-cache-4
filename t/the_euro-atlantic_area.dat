This belief is thoroughly irrational. Throughout the process of reality construction the society begun to perceive the given status as natural and right. In order to escape the question of ethical contradiction it has crowded out the negative aspects of that reality from the perception of its members, in which some psychological mechanisms are helping individuals to escape the reality.

This study explores the sensitivity of serial clustering to the choice of cyclone tracking method using cyclone track data from 15 methods derived from ERA-Interim data (1979 – 2010). Clustering is estimated by the dispersion (ratio of variance to mean) of winter [December – February (DJF) ] cyclone passages near each grid point over <b>the</b> <b>Euro-Atlantic</b> <b>area.</b> The mean number of cyclone counts and their variance are compared between methods, revealing considerable differences, particularly for the latter. Results show that all different tracking methods qualitatively capture similar large-scale spatial patterns of underdispersion and overdispersion over the study region. The quantitative differences can primarily be attributed to the differences in the variance of cyclone counts between the methods. Nevertheless, overdispersion is statistically significant for almost all methods over parts of the eastern North Atlantic and Western Europe, and is therefore considered as a robust feature. The influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on cyclone clustering displays a similar pattern for all tracking methods, with one maximum near Iceland and another between the Azores and Iberia.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{collapse of the}} Warsaw Pact, the end of global confrontation and the subsequent disintegration of the Soviet Union brought about a real opportunity for European unification and transatlantic security. Thus there is a unique chance for the states of Central and Eastern Europe to build an improved security architecture in <b>the</b> whole <b>Euro-Atlantic</b> <b>area</b> after {{half a century of}} division. That is why Central and East European countries are seeking to join NATO and in that way provide increased stability, peace and security for all without creating new dividing lines. To join NATO all Central and East European countries need to accomplish democratic transformation especially in the system of civil-military relations. Democratic civilian control of the military {{is one of the main}} prerequisites for Central and East European states to qualify for inclusion in NATO. Thus, NATO enlargement can promote democratic transformations of the East European countries, especially in civil-military relation realm, and integration of the Central and East European countries into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. By admitting new members NATO will make itself better able to address Europe's new security challenges. Such a broad concept of security embracing political, economic and defense factors can be the basis for the new security architecture which must be built through a process of integration and cooperation among the partners.

40|$|A {{review of}} European and transatlantic history since World War II {{suggest that the}} Cold War largely {{determined}} the foreign and security policies of Euro-Atlantic nations and of such international organizations as NATO. In the late 1980 s, dramatic changes in Europe {{put an end to}} the Cold War deadlock and caused the transformation of NATO. NATO's orgins reside in the era of 1919 - 1948. Formed in 1948 / 49 as a collective defense institution, NATO's purposes, procedures and capabilities were adjusted to deter the Warsaw Pact threat. Since 1990 the organization appears to be the sole one still capable of dealing with current and future risks and threats of the transition processes. The thesis analyses NATO's path from confrontation to cooperation in view of NATO's evolution, beginning with NATO from its Cold War strategies, through the revolutionary changes due to the Alliance's New Strategic Concept (Rome, 1991), and ending in the present with the outcome of the Alliance's Strategic Concept (Washington, 1999).

Furthermore, it explores the significance {{and the meaning of}} the aforementioned Articles. This thesis utilizes the case study method and refers to four distinct events that have shaped allied policies and strategies: the Suez Crisis of 1956, the establishment of the politico-military consultation process, the Yom Kippur War (1973), {{and the end of the}} Cold War (1989 - 1991).

40|$|The {{relationship}} between atmospheric blocking over Europe and the Atlantic eddy-driven jet stream is investigated in the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis {{and in a}} climate model. This is carried out using a bidimensional blocking index based on geopotential height and a diagnostic providing daily latitudinal position and strength of the jet stream. It is shown that European Blocking (EB) is not decoupled from the jet stream but it is mainly associated with its poleward displacements. Moreover, the whole blocking area placed on the equatorward side of the jet stream, broadly ranging from Azores up to Scandinavia, emerges as associated with poleward jet displacements. The diagnostics are hence applied to two different climate model simulations in order to evaluate the biases in the jet stream and in the blocking representation. This analysis highlights large underestimation of EB, typical feature of general circulation models. Interestingly, observed blocking and jet biases over <b>the</b> <b>Euro-Atlantic</b> <b>area</b> {{are consistent with the}} blocking-jet relationship observed in the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis. Finally, the importance of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) is investigated showing that realistic SSTs can reduce the bias in the jet stream variability but not in the frequency of EB.
