5|$|Muslim {{residents}} of Israel and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are normally {{allowed to enter}} the Temple Mount and pray at the al-Aqsa Mosque without restrictions. Due to security measures, the Israeli government occasionally prevents certain groups of Muslims from reaching al-Aqsa by blocking the entrances to the complex; <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> vary from time to time. At times restrictions have prevented all men under 50 and women under 45 from entering, but married men over 45 are allowed. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> are enforced {{on the occasion of}} Friday prayers, other times they are {{over an extended period of}} time. Restrictions are most severe for Gazans, followed by restrictions on those from West Bank. The Israeli government states that <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> are in place for security reasons.|$|E

The occupation of Belgium and <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> imposed upon Hergé forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations.

5|$|In 1994 Tony Hall, {{the head}} of the BBC's News and Current Affairs, argued that <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> did not allow viewers to make a proper {{judgment}} about those subject to the rules, as the subtle changes to their voices could not be heard. In particular he cited the example of the appearance of Gerry Adams on the BBC's On the Record in September 1993, in which he spoke about the prospect of peace in Northern Ireland. Hall said Adams was nervous and defensive throughout the interview as the presenter, Sheena McDonald, argued that peace could not be achieved while the IRA continued its violent stance, but that viewers were unaware of these aspects of the discussion. He also said that some countries, such as India and Egypt, had quoted <b>the</b> <b>restrictions</b> to BBC journalists who complained about the over use of censorship by authorities in those countries. Additionally Hall argued that Sinn Féin and the IRA had manipulated the ban by using it as an excuse to decline interviews.|$|E
