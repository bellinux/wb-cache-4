His posthumous Third Series, written as if unfinished and also edited by Jeanne de Salzmann (Life Is Real Only Then, When 'I Am') contains an intimate account of Gurdjieff's inner struggles during his later years, as well as transcripts {{of some of his}} lectures. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> and growing amount written about Gurdjieff's ideas and methods but his own challenging writings remain the primary sources.|$|E
25|$|Eukaryotic cells use entirely {{different}} classes of fusion proteins, the best studied {{of which are}} the SNAREs. SNARE proteins are used to direct all vesicular intracellular trafficking. Despite years of study, much is still unknown about the function of this protein class. In fact, there is still an active debate regarding whether SNAREs are linked to early docking or participate later in the fusion process by facilitating hemifusion. Even once the role of SNAREs or other specific proteins is illuminated, a unified understanding of fusion proteins is unlikely as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> diversity of structure and function within these classes, and very few themes are conserved.|$|E

Today, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> amount of waste steam and waste heat with temperatures between 100 and 150°C generated by industry. In addition, solarthermal collectors, geothermal energy sources and biomass reactors produce heat in this temperature range. There are technologies to utilise this energy, in particular the Organic Rankine Cycle. In principle, these are steam turbines which do not use water but a fluid (a refrigerant) which evaporates at temperatures below 100°C. Such systems are however fairly complex. They work with pressures of 6 to 20 bars, so that the whole system has to be completely sealed.|$|E
25|$|In some {{instances}} growers’ demand for beehives far exceeds the available supply. The number of managed beehives in the US has steadily declined from close to 6 million after WWII, {{to less than}} 2.5 million today. In contrast, the area dedicated to growing bee-pollinated crops has grown over 300% {{in the same time}} period. Additionally, {{in the past five years}} there has been a decline in winter managed beehives, which has reached an unprecedented rate of colony losses at near 30%. At present, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> demand for beehive rentals that cannot always be met. There is a clear need across the agricultural industry for a management tool to draw pollinators into cultivations and encourage them to preferentially visit and pollinate the flowering crop. By attracting pollinators like honey bees and increasing their foraging behavior, particularly in the center of large plots, we can increase grower returns and optimize yield from their plantings. ISCA Technologies, from Riverside California, created a semiochemical formulation called SPLAT Bloom, that modifies the behavior of honey bees, inciting them to visit flowers in every portion of the field.|$|E

The funeral ceremonies of the Indigenous Australians typically feature body painting; the Yolngu and Tiwi people create carved pukumani burial poles from ironwood trunks, while elaborately carved burial trees have been used in south-eastern Australia. [...] The Toraja people of central Sulawesi are famous for their burial practices, which include the setting-up of effigies of the dead on cliffs.

2500|$|A {{fish hook}} or fishhook is a device for {{catching}} fish either by impaling {{them in the}} mouth or, more rarely, by snagging {{the body of the}} fish. Fish hooks have been employed for centuries by fishermen to catch fresh and saltwater fish. In 2005, the fish hook was chosen by Forbes {{as one of the top}} twenty tools in the history of man. Fish hooks are normally attached to some form of line or lure device which connects the caught fish to the fisherman. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> variety of fish hooks in the world of fishing. Sizes, designs, shapes, and materials are all variable depending on the intended purpose of the fish hook. Fish hooks are manufactured for a range of purposes from general fishing to extremely limited and specialized applications. Fish hooks are designed to hold various types of artificial, processed, dead or live baits (bait fishing); to act as the foundation for artificial representations of fish prey (fly fishing); or to be attached to or integrated into other devices that represent fish prey (lure fishing).|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1960s, Chomsky has {{maintained}} that syntactic knowledge {{is at least}} partially inborn, implying that children need only learn certain parochial features of their native languages. Chomsky based his argument on observations about human language acquisition, noting that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich linguistic knowledge they attain (see: [...] "poverty of the stimulus" [...] argument). For example, although children are exposed to only a finite subset of the allowable syntactic variants within their first language, they somehow acquire the ability to understand and produce {{an infinite number of}} sentences, including ones that have never before been uttered. To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data (PLD) must be supplemented by an innate linguistic capacity. Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of inductive reasoning, if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks as the language acquisition device (LAD), and he suggested that one of the tasks for linguistics should be to determine what the LAD is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that would result from these constraints constitute [...] "universal grammar".|$|E
2500|$|A visitor's {{commentary}} of this {{clock was}} given after his visit {{in the summer}} of 1855 by Theodore Nielsen, a Danish kleinsmith journeyman in his memoirs. As follows. [...] "Everybody knows about the cathedral which is called Munsteren. There is a unique clock in the tower. Surely {{the only one in the}} entire world. It shows all time changes, Sun and moon eclipses besides the ordinary times of day. On top of the clock is a niche in which stands Death with a bell in one hand and a crossbone in the other. With this bone he hits the bell each hour to count the time. A Christ figure stands in yet another niche. On each side is a door, and when the clock strikes twelve the left hand door opens and the twelve apostles appear, one at a time. Each one bows deeply before Jesus who in turn lifts his right hand in benediction. Each one then disappears through the door to the right. When Judas appears Jesus hides his face in a fold of his cape. Besides all this <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> rooster that crows and flaps his wings at the same time the Death figure hits the bell with the bone. Above and to the right is a life sized figure, a replica of the man who made the clock. He sits and looks down on his handiworks and you have to look twice to realize that it is not a living person sitting there. Parisians wanted a clock just like that for the Cathedral of Notre Dame. So the burghers of Strassburgh blinded the artist in order to make him unable to undertake the commission. He then asked to be taken up into the tower just once more and this was granted. While up there he put the mechanism out of commission, and the clock was stopped for many years. Several able watchmakers volunteered their entire time to try to get the clock to work again. Some of them became deranged of sheer frustration. But at last someone found the key and since then the clock performs perfectly once more." ...|$|E
