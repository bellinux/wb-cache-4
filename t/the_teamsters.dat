5|$|Televised {{hearings}} in early 1957 exposed misconduct {{by both the}} Beck and the Hoffa factions of <b>the</b> <b>Teamsters</b> Union. Both Hoffa and Beck were indicted, but Hoffa won the battle for control of <b>the</b> <b>Teamsters.</b> In response, the AFL-CIO instituted a policy that no union official who had taken the Fifth Amendment during a corruption investigation could continue in a leadership position. Meany told <b>the</b> <b>Teamsters</b> that they could continue {{as members of the}} AFL-CIO if Hoffa resigned as president. Hoffa refused, and <b>the</b> <b>Teamsters</b> were ousted from the AFL-CIO on December 6, 1957. Meany supported the AFL-CIO's adoption of a code of ethics, {{in the wake of the}} scandal.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Teamsters</b> Union {{was by far}} {{the largest}} and most notable {{contributor}} of workers to the pipeline project. Teamsters worked in the transportation and supply aspects of the project. All trucks were driven by Teamsters, supply warehouses were run by Teamsters, and the buses that transported workers from camps to job sites were run by Teamsters. Teamsters Local 959, with more than 23,000 employees at its peak, {{was by far the}} most dominant labor force on the pipeline project. There were frequent allegations of corruption by Teamsters on the project, and the Anchorage Daily News won a Pulitzer Prize for a 15-part series on the rise of Local 959 and its influence on state politics. Repeated allegations of links to organized crime were never backed up by evidence, but two Teamsters leaders were murdered in 1976 while investigating drug activity on the pipeline project. Teamsters workers strongly denied any involvement with organized crime, and pointed to the fact that 80 percent of <b>the</b> <b>Teamsters</b> in the project had college degrees or professional and management experience.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he was a}} {{newcomer}} to the Castro District, Milk had shown leadership in the small community. He was starting {{to be taken seriously}} as a candidate and decided to run again for supervisor in 1975. He reconsidered his approach and cut his long hair, swore off marijuana, and vowed never to visit another gay bathhouse again. Milk's campaigning earned the support of <b>the</b> <b>teamsters,</b> firefighters, and construction unions. Castro Camera became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to work his campaigns for him—many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.|$|E
5|$|As oil {{production}} increased through {{the success of}} wells like the Frazier, Twin, Pool, Grant, and the two Homestead Wells, transportation of the oil {{to the outside world}} was still reliant on teamsters. <b>The</b> <b>teamsters</b> were notorious for mistreatment of their horses, most of which lost their hair due to a buildup of oil and only had a lifespan of a few months in Pithole. The high mortality rate caused a horse shortage, with more having to be brought in by rail from Ohio and New York. Teamsters often refused to work on days when the roads were impassable or gouged the oil producers.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} October 1988, {{in and around}} Los Angeles, California. Shortly {{before the beginning of}} location shooting, Hollywood union truck drivers or teamsters went on strike to protest pay cuts and overtime changes. With deadlines looming, the production searched for non-union drivers, aware that <b>the</b> <b>Teamsters</b> might retaliate by sabotaging equipment or flying airplanes above the filming to ruin audio recordings. After one of the production's camera trucks exploded in the studio parking lot, the non-union drivers headed to Yosemite National Park under cover of darkness with a police escort.|$|E
5|$|The event also {{featured}} three elimination matches and two singles matches. Razor Ramon led The Bad Guys against Diesel's team of <b>The</b> <b>Teamsters.</b> Ramon won the match {{for his team}} after {{all members of the}} other team were counted out. Doink the Clown teamed with three midgets to form Clowns R' Us in a match against The Royal Family, composed of Jerry Lawler and three midgets. The Royal Family won the match, but all seven other competitors attacked Lawler after the match. Lex Luger led Guts and Glory against the Million Dollar Corporation team, which was managed by Ted DiBiase. DiBiase's team won after Luger, the last wrestler from his team, was pinned.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, Carpenter, with Captain Nolan {{as second}} in command, and three {{companies}} of troopers {{headed out to}} Sulfur Springs to deny that source of water to the Apaches. In the early light of day, Victorio saw a string of wagons rounding a mountain spur to the southeast and about eight miles distant, crawling onto the plain. Victorio sent a band of warriors riding {{out of the mountains}} and attacked savagely. The wagons held a load of provisions for Fort Davis with a company of infantry riding in some of the wagons. The warriors were met with rifle fire, as <b>the</b> <b>teamsters</b> circled the wagons in defensive positions. Alerted by his Indian scouts, Carpenter and two companies charged to the rescue. The Apache attack disintegrated as the warriors fled in confusion to the southwest to rejoin Victorio's main force as it moved deeper into the Carrizo Mountains. Nolan's ambush was not ready and the scattered warriors were able to avoid them.|$|E

5|$|The first {{match of}} the event saw The Bad Guys, which {{consisted}} of Razor Ramon, the 1-2-3 Kid, the Davey Boy Smith, and The Headshrinkers (Sione and Fatu) versus <b>The</b> <b>Teamsters,</b> composed of Diesel, Shawn Michaels, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart, and Jim Neidhart. The opening minutes of the match featured brothers-in-law Hart and Smith trading moves as well as Jarrett and Ramon brawling. Fatu became the first wrestler eliminated after Diesel performed a Jackknife powerbomb on him. Diesel eliminated the 1-2-3 Kid forty-two seconds later after another Jackknife powerbomb. Sione followed thirty-one seconds later after being pinned by Diesel. Davey Boy Smith entered the ring, but Diesel soon knocked him between the ropes to the arena floor. Hart and Neidhart prevented Smith from getting back in the ring, and Smith was eliminated after the referee counted him out. Razor Ramon was left as {{the only member of}} his team to face the five members of <b>The</b> <b>Teamsters.</b> He fought with Diesel for several minutes, but Diesel then performed the Jackknife powerbomb on him and prepared to pin him for the victory. Michaels insisted on having Diesel hold Ramon while Michaels performed a superkick on their opponent. Ramon dodged the kick, and Michaels kicked Diesel in the face. Diesel became angry at Michaels, particularly because the same mistake had cost Diesel the Intercontinental Championship at SummerSlam. He and Michaels argued outside the ring {{while the rest of the}} team attempted to calm them down. The referee counted all five wrestlers out of the ring and declared Razor Ramon the winner of the match. Shawn Michaels was shown backstage after the match, and he stated that he was disbanding his tag team with Diesel and vacating the Tag Team Championship. He then got into a car and drove away from the arena.|$|E
5|$|Several storylines {{formed the}} {{background}} for the opening match, which saw the fan favorite team of The Bad Guys (Razor Ramon, the 1-2-3 Kid, Davey Boy Smith and The Headshrinkers) square off against the villainous team of <b>The</b> <b>Teamsters</b> (Shawn Michaels, Diesel, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart and Jim Neidhart). Razor Ramon had been feuding with Shawn Michaels since September 1993 when Ramon won the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Michaels, the former champion, had been stripped of the belt. WWF President Jack Tunney scheduled a battle royal, in which Ramon and Rick Martel were the final participants remaining. They faced each other on Monday Night Raw, and Ramon won the match and was awarded the title. Michaels claimed {{that he was the}} rightful holder of the belt and refused to acknowledge Ramon as the champion. Diesel was serving as Michaels' bodyguard but soon became an active wrestler and carried on Michaels' feud with Ramon. In {{the months leading up to}} Survivor Series, Ramon had also developed a feud with Jeff Jarrett, and the two faced each other several times with the Intercontinental Championship on the line. Ramon's friend, the 1-2-3 Kid, took Ramon's side in these feuds, and the two formed an occasional tag team. The Headshrinkers had also been feuding with Michaels and Diesel since dropping the WWF Tag Team Championship to them on August 28. The Headshrinkers had several rematches but were unable to regain the belts. Finally, Davey Boy Smith was involved in a feud with his real-life brother-in-law Owen Hart and Hart's other brother-in-law, Jim Neidhart. Owen Hart had turned on his brother Bret at the 1994 Royal Rumble, after which Smith got involved on Bret's side and Neidhart took Owen's side.|$|E

5000|$|A week later, on February 8, 1991, Mathis {{recommended}} that <b>the</b> <b>Teamster</b> executive council {{look into the}} bidding process McCarthy used to award his son-in-law a contract to print the union magazine. Mathis' move was widely seen as a possible [...] "coup attempt": If McCarthy {{were found to have}} committed improper acts, he would be forced to resign—allowing Mathis to become president of the union as well as be seen as a reformer. But <b>the</b> <b>Teamster</b> general board deadlocked 7—7 over the issue, and no investigation was made.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Teamsters</b> had {{endorsed}} Ronald Reagan {{for president}} in 1980, creating a furor within the American labor movement. However, AFL-CIO officials expressed hope that <b>the</b> <b>Teamsters</b> would endorse the Democratic candidate in 1984. This hope proved wrong.|$|E
25|$|In October 1987, Presser led <b>the</b> <b>Teamsters</b> {{back into}} the AFL-CIO. Presser had {{repeatedly}} said he was uninterested in reaffiliation, and AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland had been deeply angered by Presser's attempt to merge with the ITU and to raid AFL-CIO affiliated unions with members in the publishing industry. But as Presser's legal problems mounted and a federal takeover of the union appeared more and more likely, Presser sought reaffiliation {{as a means of}} shielding <b>the</b> <b>Teamsters</b> from the government. In August and September 1987, leaders of the AFL-CIO and <b>the</b> <b>Teamsters</b> secretly worked out a tentative reaffiliation agreement—exactly 30 years after <b>the</b> <b>Teamsters</b> were first expelled for corruption. Pushing reaffiliation on the AFL-CIO side were Robert Georgine, president of the Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO, and William H. Wynn, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers. Law enforcement officials said the reaffiliation undercut their effort to put <b>the</b> <b>Teamsters</b> under federal control.|$|E
25|$|Jackie Presser {{was elected}} {{president}} of <b>the</b> <b>Teamsters</b> on April 21, 1983. He pledged to re-invigorate the union, organize new members, and end trucking deregulation. He also said he had no opinion as to whether <b>the</b> <b>Teamsters</b> should rejoin the AFL-CIO.|$|E

25|$|In 1951, Tobin's tenuous hold on <b>the</b> <b>Teamsters</b> {{was further}} exposed when Tom Hickey, reformist leader of <b>the</b> <b>Teamsters</b> in New York City, won {{election}} to the executive board. Tobin had needed Beck's support to prevent Hickey's election, and Beck refused to give it.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, <b>The</b> <b>Teamsters</b> {{strongly}} {{endorsed the}} American labor movement's no-strike pledge. <b>The</b> <b>Teamsters</b> agreed to cease raiding other unions and not strike {{for the duration}} of the national emergency. President Tobin even ordered Teamsters members to cross picket lines put up by other unions. Nevertheless, the national leadership sanctioned strikes by Midwestern truckers in August 1942, Southern truckers in October 1943, and brewery workers and milk delivery drivers in January 1945. <b>The</b> <b>Teamsters</b> did not, however, participate in the great post-war wave of labor strikes. In the two years following the cessation of hostilities, <b>the</b> <b>Teamsters</b> struck only three times: 10,000 truckers in New Jersey struck for two weeks; workers at UPS struck nationwide for three weeks; and workers at Railway Express Agency struck for almost a month.|$|E
