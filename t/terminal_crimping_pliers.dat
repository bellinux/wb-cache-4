50|$|Detonator <b>crimping</b> <b>pliers,</b> cap <b>crimping</b> <b>pliers</b> or {{detonator}} <b>crimping</b> tool is {{a common}} tool when working with explosives. The construction {{is very similar to}} the construction of any other multi-tool or pliers. The specific feature is the presence of one groove on each of the opposing jaws. When the jaws are open, the groves will appear as a semi circle with an elliptical extension. When fully closed the two grooves will form a cylindrical shape.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{describes the}} development of compact and efficient tools {{which can be used}} by a 4 -DOF robot during an automated process aimed at the building of heating coils. Resistive wires must be cut and crimped into small connectors at a fast pace, with extreme repeatability and reliability. We designed two special tools for the end effector of a parallel-kinematic robotic device, exploiting a compact and lightweight design. Wire cutting has been obtained by means of two custom blades. A test bed has been build in order to investigate the optimal shape of the blades, hence minimizing the actuating force and wear effects. A new cutting method has been proposed and a final cutting tool has been designed and mounted on the robot. Crimping the resistive wire into miniaturized connectors required {{the development of}} small, yet stiff, pneumatic <b>crimping</b> <b>pliers.</b> The cutting tool and the <b>crimping</b> <b>pliers</b> have been mounted on a single multifunctional end-effector. The robot successfully performed the high-speed tests, showing the high performance of the tools...|$|R
50|$|They fulfill {{numerous}} uses, including {{allowing the}} wires {{to be easily}} terminated to screw terminals, fast-on / quick-disconnect / spade-foot type terminals, wire splices, or various combinations of these. A tube-shaped connector with two crimps for splicing wires in-line is called a butt splice connector. Crimp-on connectors are attached by inserting the stripped end of a stranded wire into {{a portion of the}} connector, which is then mechanically deformed / compressed (crimped) tightly around the wire. The crimping is accomplished with special <b>crimping</b> <b>pliers.</b> A key idea behind crimped connectors is that the finished connection is gas-tight.|$|R

50|$|The {{rear part}} of a {{detonator}} is usually made of a rigid but malleable aluminium alloy, sometimes supported by a relatively soft brass or copper structure to aid in reliably giving a strong and watertight seal without damaging the initiation source. A pair of detonator <b>crimping</b> <b>pliers</b> mate the detonator with the initiation source by allowing the detonator's back end to be inserted into the large hole present when the pliers is in the non-compressed position. When force is applied, the jaws will move closer to each other crimping {{the neck of the}} detonator. This shows that the function is just a simple crimping tool, adapted for one specific item.|$|R
50|$|Certain Ideal and Eclipse {{interchangeable}} dies are in {{the same}} format as the Harbor Freight 97420 crimping tool's interchangeable dies. Although the Harbor Freight tool is intended only for insulated <b>terminal</b> <b>crimps,</b> and additional dies are not sold by Harbor Freight, this tool will accept Ideal and Eclipse interchangeable dies for other format crimps. The Harbor Freight tool is ratcheting and is adjustable, just as are the Ideal and Eclipse tools.|$|R
50|$|Plastic {{spiral binding}} is a three-step process: punch, insert, crimp. First, a punch creates holes {{along the edge}} of the document. Second, a coil {{inserter}} spins the coils through the holes. Third, a pair of coil <b>crimping</b> <b>pliers</b> or a <b>crimping</b> machine is used to cut off the excess coil and crimp the end to prevent the coil from coming loose from the document. There are also more automated systems that will insert and cut and crimp the coil in one process and even some fully automated systems that will punch, insert, and crimp for the very high volume users. Light volume or personal users may choose to buy a single machine that does all of these features or may even choose to spin the coils onto their books by hand. Higher volume users will often choose to separate these three functions to help increase productivity.|$|R

They are no longer solely manufactured from lead but instead are often made from softer materials {{that can be easily}} pressed onto the fishing line instead of being closed in a <b>crimp</b> using <b>pliers</b> as was once common.|$|R

40|$|Conference Name:International Conference on Manufacturing Science and Engineering (ICMSE 2009). Conference Address: Zhuhai, PEOPLES R CHINA. Time:DEC 26 - 28, 2009. Having {{studied the}} {{synchronized}} multi-axis control servo system, some type automatic wire striping and <b>terminal</b> <b>crimping</b> system is {{developed in the}} paper. In order to realize the precise and efficient synchronized multi-axis control, the PVT (Position-Velocity-Time) algorithm is adopted. This algorithm allows user to specify the time interval of each axis' motion segment, so the multi-axis working sequence can be easily established in a tight way which augments the system processing speed and guarantees the system stability. Besides, by specifying the position and speed value at the processing point, the positioning accuracy and speed requirement at the processing point can be reached. In {{the design of the}} system control software, the modularization design is employed. This modularization idea simplifies the complex software design and allows people use the software more easily. Finally, the experimental result shows the system has a good synchronization performance, and meets the requirements of high efficiency, stability and positioning accuracy in practical production...|$|R
40|$|Generally, {{hand-operated}} and hydraulic compressors use <b>crimping</b> {{of connection}} <b>terminals.</b> However, this equipment often causes compressed defects because non-uniform pressure is {{applied in the}} circumferential direction of the <b>terminal</b> during <b>crimping.</b> A defective <b>terminal</b> often leads to fire in electric equipment due to overheating. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop a new crimping process for manufacturing highly durable terminals. MPC (magnetic pulse crimping) uses uniform electromagnetic pressure by a high magnetic field interaction between coil and terminal. This process uses only electromagnetic pressure for <b>crimping,</b> so the <b>terminal</b> can be <b>crimped</b> without physical contact, thereby producing a highly durable connection terminal. In this study, a MPC process was developed to fabricate a prototypical terminal. The result was compared with other crimping processes in terms of durability. The crimped part using MPC has a lower rising temperature and higher tensile strength than those using other crimping process. It is inferred from the experimental results that an optimal charging voltage exists in the MPC proces...|$|R
50|$|One type of {{terminal}} block accepts wires that are prepared only by removing (stripping) a short length of insulation from the end. Another type accepts wires that have ring or spade <b>terminal</b> lugs <b>crimped</b> onto the wires. Printed circuit board (PCB) mounted {{terminal block}}s allow individual wires {{to be connected}} to the circuit board. PCB mounted terminal blocks are soldered to the board, but they are available in a pull-apart version that allows the wire-connecting half of the block to be unplugged from the part that is soldered to the PCB.|$|R
50|$|Tinsel wire is {{commonly}} connected to equipment with <b>crimped</b> <b>terminal</b> lugs that pierce the insulation {{to make contact}} with the metal ribbons, rather than stripping insulation. Separated from the core, the individual ribbons are relatively fragile, and the core can be damaged by high temperatures. These factors make it difficult or impractical to terminate tinsel wire by soldering during equipment manufacture, although soldering is possible, with some difficulty, to repair a failed connection. However, the conductors tend to break at their junction with the rigid solder.|$|R
40|$|Goal of {{this work}} is the {{development}} of a new package to be integrated into large-area smart textiles. The benefits of the well-known crimp technology are transferred to a new field. The so-called Crimp Flat Pack (CFP) is a lead-frame based electronic package that features <b>crimp</b> <b>terminals</b> instead of standard leads. The module can be directly attached to different types of substrates, in particular to fabric circuits. Its size and complexity can reach from a simple two-terminal package to larger multi-terminal devices. The standard sized module has a circuit board area of 2 cm × 2 cm and 10 <b>crimp</b> <b>terminals.</b> Eight of them are used for the communication between other modules and for mechanical attachment. Two terminals are used to attach a sensor that collects data inside the fabric. Mainly two tools were developed for the process. At first, a forming tool that bends the contact pins upwards and brings the crimp barrels into shape as well as the actual crimping tool that allows parallel crimping. On the system's side of view the module carries a simple micro-controller and passives. Communication between neighboring modules is done via I 2;C-protocol. Measurement of sensor date inside the fabric can be realized. The new package opens opportunities to the manufacturing of smart textiles as it uses standard manufacturing technologies as well as a robust, low-cost, and low-temperature interconnection technology...|$|R
