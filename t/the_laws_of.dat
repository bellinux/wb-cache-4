5|$|As it is {{constructed}} using tensors, general relativity exhibits general covariance: its laws—and further laws formulated within the general relativistic framework—take {{on the same}} form in all coordinate systems. Furthermore, the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures, i.e. it is background independent. It thus satisfies a more stringent general principle of relativity, namely that <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> physics are {{the same for all}} observers. Locally, as expressed in the equivalence principle, spacetime is Minkowskian, and <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> physics exhibit local Lorentz invariance.|$|E

40|$|This article {{intends to}} {{demonstrate}} that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> value can be understood based on three successive versions, through which it becomes progressively more complex. <b>The</b> least complex <b>law</b> is <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> value determined by years worked. The second version is <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> social work distribution (which may also be interpreted as <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> equilibrium in <b>the</b> distribution of social work). Examination {{of the impact of}} intrasectorial competition among capitals in the capitalist economy leads to the third version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> value, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> minimization of abstract work time.

5|$|A priori, it is {{not clear}} whether the new local frames in free fall {{coincide}} with the reference frames in which <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> special relativity hold—that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. below). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity. The generalization of this statement, namely that <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.|$|E
