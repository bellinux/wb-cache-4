40|$|Objective: The role of <b>technical</b> <b>review</b> is to {{mitigate}} risk to DSM program administrators. If done effectively, <b>technical</b> <b>review</b> should aid the cost effectiveness of DSM programs by improving on targeted net-to-gross ratios and savings persistence. Ex-post impact evaluations of programs have detailed protocols for evaluators to follow, however those conducting the <b>technical</b> <b>review</b> of ex-ante projects have limited guidance material to follow. The {{objective of this}} paper is to assess the benefits and costs of ex-ante <b>technical</b> <b>review</b> for large, unique and, primarily, industrial projects to develop a framework for <b>technical</b> <b>review</b> practice that advises an appropriate approach and rigor for maximizing the cost-effectiveness of DSM programs. Methodology and Scope of Research: 1. Empirical analysis of reported energy savings at the application, reviewed (contracted), measurement and verification (M&V) and evaluation stages for multiple large or industrial incentive programs. a. Assess impact of <b>technical</b> <b>review</b> rigor on reviewed values compared to M&V results b. Assess impact of <b>technical</b> <b>review</b> rigor on reviewed values compared to evaluation results (net-to-gross) c. Assess impact of <b>technical</b> <b>review</b> rigor on program participation 2. Identify examples of appropriate approaches to <b>technical</b> <b>review</b> based on empirical results. 3. Develop methods to screen potential projects to maximize program cost effectiveness, considering the effective useful life, free-ridership (partial and deferred) and incremental savings and costs. 4. Develop stratified approaches and practices for performing base case, measure and cost analysis. Results: Development of a framework to align various large, capital incentive, DSM program designs to a standard approach for <b>technical</b> <b>review...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{guidance}} {{is intended}} to help ensure that NASA scientific and technical information (STI) receives the appropriate level of <b>technical</b> <b>review</b> pertinent to its nature and impact. Under most circumstances, NASA STI falls within the “Basic/Minimum ” level (Level 1) of <b>technical</b> <b>review</b> discussed in Section 2. Publication types are given in Table 1. NASA establishes <b>technical</b> <b>review</b> requirements for this level of review. In some circumstances, a “Basic/Higher ” level of <b>technical</b> <b>review</b> (Level 2) is called for and encouraged; Level 2, which is a full peer review by a committee of experts, is discussed in Section 3. NASA establishes <b>technical</b> <b>review</b> requirements for this level of review. In extremely rare and unusual circumstances, NASA STI may fall within the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMBs) definitions of “Influential ” or “Highly Influential” information or assessments, as defined in OMB’s “Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review, ” although those categories are normally more pertinent to Federal Agencies with policymaking or other statutory authority.

50|$|The {{politics}} of IPTi are well documented and illustrate the working of contemporary international health politics. The promising {{results of the}} first two IPTi studies {{led to the creation of}} the IPTi Consortium, whose brief is to determine the efficacy, safety, relation of efficacy to drug sensitivity, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability of this intervention. The IPTi Consortium received approximately US$28 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). A WHO <b>technical</b> advisory <b>group</b> <b>reviewed</b> the evidence relevant for the widespread introduction of IPTi available in 2008, and came to the conclusion that the available evidence was not sufficient to recommend the widespread introduction of IPTi -SP. Program officers of the BMGF as well as scientists funded by the BMGF criticised the WHO conclusions. The criticism from the BMGF in turn triggered a memorandum of the WHO malaria chief Dr. Akira Kochi to the director general of the WHO which was leaked to The New York Times.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} initial {{findings from}} an ongoing research project studying {{the social and}} organizational practices of <b>technical</b> <b>reviews</b> at NASA. <b>Technical</b> <b>reviews</b> are a ubiquitous part of organizational life in most technical organizations, {{and one of the}} most consequential in terms of risk and innovation management. At NASA, a series of formal <b>technical</b> <b>reviews</b> are conducted across the mission lifecycle, including preliminary and critical design reviews in conceptual design as well as launch and flight readiness reviews in mission operations. Additionally, less formal engineering peer reviews are often conducted as pre-cursors to formal reviews. While recent reports at NASA–most prominent the Columbia investigation report–criticize the inadequate practice of <b>technical</b> <b>reviews,</b> little is known about the specific behavioral impacts of review processes. The objective of this research project is to systematically collect much needed empirical data to model the functional and dysfunctional effects of formal and informal <b>technical</b> <b>reviews</b> on work practices, managerial decision making, and organizational culture. We introduce a novel conceptual framework distinguishing formal, documentary reviews and informal, discursive reviews as two substantially different sets of practices. We show how each of these practices inhibit or facilitate effective knowledge sharing between project engineers and external experts. The paper also presents some initial empirical findings supporting this framework. 1 1477...|$|R
