5|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>comprehensive</b> {{primary source}} on Van Gogh is the {{correspondence}} {{between him and}} his younger brother, Theo. Their lifelong friendship, and most of what is known of Vincent's thoughts and theories of art, are recorded in the hundreds of letters they exchanged from 1872 until 1890. Theo van Gogh was an art dealer and provided his brother with financial and emotional support, and access to influential people on the contemporary art scene.|$|E

5|$|Roman Academic Cotta ridicules both {{literal and}} allegorical {{acceptance}} of myth, declaring roundly that myths {{have no place}} in philosophy. Cicero is also generally disdainful of myth, but, like Varro, he is emphatic in his support for the state religion and its institutions. It is difficult to know how far down the social scale this rationalism extended. Cicero asserts that no one (not even old women and boys) is so foolish as to believe in the terrors of Hades or the existence of Scyllas, centaurs or other composite creatures, but, on the other hand, the orator elsewhere complains of the superstitious and credulous character of the people. De Natura Deorum is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>comprehensive</b> summary of Cicero's line of thought.|$|E
5|$|Romantic {{thinking}} was {{also evident in}} the writings of Hugh Miller, stonemason and geologist, who followed in the tradition of Naturphilosophie, arguing that nature was a pre-ordained progression towards the human race. Publisher, historian, antiquarian and scientist Robert Chambers (1802–71) became a friend of Scott, writing a biography of him after the author's death. Chambers also became a geologist, researching in Scandinavia and Canada. His most influential work was the anonymously published Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844), which was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>comprehensive</b> written argument in favour of evolution before the work of Charles Darwin (1809–82). His work was strongly influenced by transcendental anatomy, which, drawing on Goethe and Lorenz Oken (1779–1851), looked for ideal patterns and structure in nature and had been pioneered in Scotland by figures including Robert Knox (1791–1862).|$|E

5|$|The report {{published}} by the Tower Commission was delivered to the president on February 26, 1987. The Commission had interviewed 80 witnesses to the scheme, including Reagan, {{and two of the}} arms trade middlemen: Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi. The 200-page report was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>comprehensive</b> of any released, criticizing the actions of Oliver North, John Poindexter, Caspar Weinberger, and others. It determined that President Reagan did not have knowledge of the extent of the program, especially about the diversion of funds to the Contras, although it argued that the president ought to have had better control of the National Security Council staff. The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions. A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus that Reagan should have listened to his National Security Advisor more, thereby placing more {{power in the hands of}} that chair.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{developed}} his theology in his biblical commentaries {{as well as}} his sermons and treatises, but <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>comprehensive</b> expression of his views is found in his magnum opus, the Institutes of the Christian Religion. He intended that the book be used as a summary of his views on Christian theology and that it be read in conjunction with his commentaries. The various editions of that work spanned nearly his entire career as a reformer, and the successive revisions of the book show that his theology changed very little from his youth to his death. The first edition from 1536 consisted of only six chapters. The second edition, published in 1539, was three times as long because he added chapters on subjects that appear in Melanchthon's Loci Communes. In 1543, he again added new material and expanded a chapter on the Apostles' Creed. The final edition of the Institutes appeared in 1559. By then, the work consisted of four books of eighty chapters, and each book was named after statements from the creed: Book 1 on God the Creator, Book 2 on the Redeemer in Christ, Book 3 on receiving the Grace of Christ through the Holy Spirit, and Book 4 on the Society of Christ or the Church.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the mixed {{responses}} from the traditional magic scene, Dan and Dave continued with their cardistry creations. In 2004, {{with the help of}} Kenner, the twins released an instructional DVD on cardistry named The Dan and Dave System. The System is perceived as having officially separated advanced card flourishing from card magic and defined the style of cardistry. Filmed with digital movie cameras at film studios and professional edited, the critically praised $30 DVD inspired thousands of sleight of hand artists {{all over the world to}} embark on cardistry. Four years later, the twins released a three-disc DVD set known as The Trilogy, showcasing some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>comprehensive</b> and difficult flourishes ever created. Retailing at $85 per copy, The Trilogy is the bestselling cardistry release of all time, having sold more than 25,000 units. Pang wrote that just about every cardist lists either the System or The Trilogy as the reason they got into card flourishing.|$|E
5|$|Liniers was {{succeeded by}} Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros {{a few months}} later, who pardoned the mutineers to reduce {{political}} conflicts. Cisneros allowed free trade as well, as instructed by the Junta of Seville, which benefited British merchants; Britain was allied with Spain in the Peninsular War. The agents of the Consulate of Cadiz asserted that this would hurt the local economy, moral values, social usages, religious practices, and the loyalty to Spain and its monarchy. As a result, Cisneros closed trade again, restoring the Spanish monopsony. A group of hacendados (owners of haciendas), who did not feel adequately represented at the Cabildo, asked Moreno to defend them. Moreno wrote The Representation of the Landowners, a report that represented the export interest of the landowners, encouraged free trade, and condemned the privileges of the merchants benefited from the monopsony. It is considered <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>comprehensive</b> economic report {{from the time of}} the viceroyalty. It represented the new European economic ideas, and noted that the legal monopsony with Spain did not prevent British goods from being smuggled. Several authors have questioned Moreno's authorship of the paper, considering it instead an update of another, previously drafted by Manuel Belgrano, Secretary of the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires, written to make a similar request to the former viceroy Liniers. This report, as well as Moreno's prestige in the colonial society, helped him gain the confidence of Cisneros. Yet secretly, Moreno supported the plan to dismiss the Viceroy.|$|E
5|$|Rufus Wilmot Griswold (February 13, 1815 – August 27, 1857) was an American anthologist, editor, poet, and critic. Born in Vermont, Griswold {{left home}} when he was 15 years old. He worked as a journalist, editor, and critic in Philadelphia, New York City, and elsewhere. He built up a strong {{literary}} reputation, {{in part due to}} his 1842 collection The Poets and Poetry of America. This anthology, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>comprehensive</b> of its time, included what he deemed the best examples of American poetry. He produced revised versions and similar anthologies for the remainder of his life, although many of the poets he promoted have since faded into obscurity. Many writers hoped to have their work included in one of these editions, although they commented harshly on Griswold's abrasive character. Griswold was married three times: his first wife died young, his second marriage ended in a public and controversial divorce, and his third wife left him after the previous divorce was almost repealed.|$|E
