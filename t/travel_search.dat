40|$|In this article, the {{phenomenon}} of <b>searching</b> for <b>travel</b> information on the Web is reported. The issues of how predominant <b>travel</b> <b>searching</b> is on the Web, how people are <b>searching</b> for <b>travel</b> information on the Web, and what terms people are using to express their travel-related information needs are investigated. In this research, 2, 465, 145 interactions from 534, 507 users of the commer-cial Web search engine, Dogpile. com, on May 6, 2005 are analyzed employing both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Findings show that, at most, approximately 6. 5 % of Web queries are for <b>travel</b> <b>searching.</b> Geographical information accounts for nearly 50 % of this <b>travel</b> <b>searching,</b> with general <b>travel</b> information accounting for just less than 10 %. An analysis of individual terms in travel queries shows there is substantial searching for travel-specific websites such as mapquest, travelocity, and orbitz. Travel searchers appear to be target-specific events, again showing a strong geographical bias along with a temporal component of the underlying information intent. The distribution of travel topics is skewed, with several topics being “very focused ” and others being “very general. ” A classification scheme for travel-related Web queries was developed, which should be helpful for other researchers in the online <b>travel</b> <b>searching</b> area. The implications for both content providers of travel information and for searchers of travel information on the Web are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to distinguish changes in online <b>travel</b> information <b>search</b> behavior among genera-tional (baby boomer and Generation X) cohorts between 1995 and 2000. Although significant increases in <b>travel</b> in-formation <b>search</b> behavior were found across all cohorts be-tween the two periods, the study also found that older baby boomer cohorts reported greater increases in the likelihood of <b>travel</b> information <b>search</b> behavior than Generation Xers at large. This empirically validates the notion that boomers adopted the Internet earlier than traditionally assumed. The study provides explanatory detail using a synthesis of litera-ture across the areas of technology adoption theory, e-com-merce, and sociology. The findings provide an evolutionary perspective of online <b>travel</b> information <b>search</b> behavior a...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the causal relationship between changes in online <b>travel</b> information <b>searching</b> behavior and the effects of biological age, time of travel, and generational cohort over time. Household data of 1997 and 2002 were utilized for this study. Independent samples t-tests and One-way Analysis of Variance were carried out to test the relationship between online <b>travel</b> information <b>searching</b> and the effects of time-related variables, and then stepwise logistic regression was employed to identify key determinants that explain variations in online <b>travel</b> information <b>searching</b> behavior over time. The results of the study provided evidence of time of travel and generational cohort impacts on online <b>travel</b> information <b>searching</b> behavior over time. The odds of a respondent <b>searching</b> for <b>travel</b> information online were 237 % higher for 2002 pleasure travelers than for 1997 pleasure travelers and 42 % lower for those that were born in 1935 − 1939 than for those born in 1980 − 1984.
