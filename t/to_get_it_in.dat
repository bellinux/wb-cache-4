5|$|In Suzuki's songwriting process, {{he would}} first compose on a {{synthesizer}} before working with programmers <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the game. His personal pieces play when the player is walking about the map, out of battle. Suzuki's favorite piece {{is the music}} that plays while the player is on a bicycle, which he composed in advance of this job but found appropriate to include. He wrote over 100 pieces, but {{much of it was}} not included in the game. The team wrote enough music as to fill eight megabits of the 24 megabit cartridge—about two compact discs.|$|E
5|$|One scene {{involved}} a burning head, {{which was created}} by taking a cast of the actor's face, head and body with a plaster, then placing soft rubber over the cast to simulate human flesh. It was also treated so it did not release black smoke like a rubber tire when it burned. For burn effects placed on the body after the fire, the crew made a sculpture of the wounds, then mounted them onto rubber appliances, which were glued to the actor. For Harriet's death scene, in which she is scalped and her brain is visible, makeup artist Cindy Jordan put a cap over actress V. Joy Lee's head and covered it with mortician's wax {{to make it look}} bumpy. Another special effect {{involved a}} spirit that appears in the form of ectoplasm during a séance. It was created from cellulose, water and green food coloring. It proved difficult to make, and several attempts were made before the right consistency was achieved. To create the appearance of it coming out of actress V. Joy Lee's mouth, an eight-foot long hose was attached to the side of her face. Project manager Mark Seibert had to suck the fake ectoplasm through the hose <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>in,</b> then during filming he spit it out. It took several shots before the take was successful, and it looked so funny during filming that the crew kept laughing during takes.|$|E

After receiving positive reviews the book then gained the backing of Bloomsbury Publishing who published it with a quote on the cover from Mick Jagger saying that he 'loved it'. It was published under the title The Rules of Play in the US by Soho Press in 2010.|$|E

25|$|The TNT {{business}} {{model is a}} television network, its main source of income is advertisement. The TV signal passes through a system of the TNT’s regional TV stations {{as well as to}} the company’s regional partners. Those, in turn, get part of the advertising time within the framework of the content provided by the TNT. The TNT channel delivers its signal via a number of satellites staying in four different orbits, which allows its 27 television stations and more than 350 TNT’s subdivisions <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the corresponding time zones. The TNT signal is then received and further redistributed by the local network stations broadcasting to most of the big cities as well as 5,900 smaller communities of the Russian Federation.|$|E
25|$|At age nineteen, he was {{approached}} {{to play an}} American, Junior Sailen, in the film The War Lover (1962), which starred Steve McQueen. To prepare for the role, he would spend hours listening to Woody Woodbury, a famous American comedian of the time, to try to perfect an American accent. After The War Lover, Crawford briefly returned to the stage and, after playing the lead role in the 1963 British film Two Left Feet, was offered {{a role in the}} British television series, Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life, as the Mod-style, tough-talking, motorbike-riding Byron. It was this character that attracted film director Richard Lester to hire him for the role of Colin in The Knack …and How <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>in</b> 1965. The film was a huge success in the UK.|$|E
500|$|I {{found that}} such a {{pendulum}} actually was used during the Spanish and German inquisitions. [...] At first we tried to use a rubberized blade, and that's why it got stuck on Kerr's chest. [...] We then switched to a sharp metalized blade covered with steel paint. [...] The problem was <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> exactly the right position so it would slash John's shirt without actually cutting him. [...] To guard against this, we put a steel band around his waist where the pendulum crosses. [...] He was a good sport about it...but noticed him perspiring a good bit and no wonder. [...] That pendulum was carving out a 50 foot arc just above his body.|$|E

500|$|Lofton {{was again}} on the move when on December 23, 2003, the New York Yankees signed him to a two-year, $6.2 million contract. During a Yankees' road game at Cleveland, Lofton {{recorded}} his 2,000th career hit. After Lofton's single, Indians fans began an ovation in honor of Lofton. [...] "I didn't know what to expect. I figured I'd get a few claps. It was touching. I tipped my hat, but they just kept going. If there was a storybook {{way for me to}} get it, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Cleveland, it was something to remember." [...] New York finished the regular season with an AL-best record, 10161. To begin the post-season, the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to one, in the 2004 ALDS. In the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees had built a 20 series lead when Lofton stated, [...] "My ultimate goal is for me to try to win a championship. I'm at a point in my career [...] I've been here for 13 years, and gotten close. This is an opportunity for me to have a chance at it again." [...] Then Yankees would go up in the series three games to none before becoming the first team in MLB history to lose a series after holding a 30 series.|$|E

2500|$|A serve (or, more formally, a [...] "service") {{in tennis}} is a shot {{to start a}} point. The serve is {{initiated}} by tossing {{the ball into the}} air and hitting it (usually near the apex of its trajectory) into the diagonally opposite service box without touching the net. The serve may be hit under- or overhand although underhand serving remains a rarity. If the ball hits the net on the first serve and bounces over into the correct diagonal box then it is called a [...] "let" [...] and the server gets two more additional serves <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>in.</b> There can also be a let if the server serves the ball and the receiver isn't prepared. If the server misses his or her first serve and gets a let on the second serve, then they get one more try to get the serve in the box.|$|E
