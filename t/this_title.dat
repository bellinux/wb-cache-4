5|$|We incline to {{the view}} that on his abdication the Duke of Windsor could not have claimed the right to be {{described}} as a Royal Highness.

A document purportedly by Crowley naming Grant as his successor was subsequently exposed as a hoax created by Robert Taylor, a Typhonian O.T.O. member. In the early 1970s he established his own Thelemic organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., which produced its first official announcement in 1973. Although adopting the O.T.O. degree system used by Crowley, Grant removed the rituals of initiation designed to allow a member to enter a higher degree; instead he personally promoted them through the degrees according to what he believed were their own personal spiritual development.|$|E

5|$|Carmelo Camet {{was born}} on October 29, 1904, the son of Francisco Carmelo Camet, a fencer at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, and Clara Isa. The elder Camet, though officially an athlete from France, is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} Argentina's first Olympic participant. This is disputed, however, by those who claim that Horatio Torromé should hold <b>this</b> <b>title</b> as the first official Argentine representative. Carmelo had one brother, Carlos Ernesto Camet, who pursued a political career. Carlos, who served as a deputy to the national congress, was, like the rest of his family, supportive of the Radical Civil Union, an Argentine political reform party formed in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|Corrector totius orientis (governor of {{the entire}} East): it is {{generally}} accepted by modern scholars that he bore <b>this</b> <b>title.</b> The corrector had an overall command of the Roman armies and authority over the Roman provincial governors in the designated region. There are no known attestations of the title during Odaenathus' lifetime. Evidences for the king bearing the title are two inscriptions in Palmyrene dialect; one posthumous dedication describing him as MTQNNʿ of the East (derived from the Aramaic root TQN, meaning to set in order), and the other describing his heir Vaballathus with the same title albeit using the word PNRTTʿ instead of MTQNNʿ.|$|E
