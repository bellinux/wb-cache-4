In the course of the search she collapsed and died of heart failure.

5|$|A week later, Marion's sister Lila {{arrives in}} Fairvale and confronts Sam about the {{whereabouts}} of her sister. Private investigator Milton Arbogast approaches them and confirms that Marion is wanted for stealing the $40,000. He checks the motels, and Norman's evasive and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicions. After hearing that Marion had met Norman's mother, he asks to speak with her, but Norman refuses. Arbogast calls Lila and Sam to update them. He goes to the Bates' home in search of Norman's mother; as he reaches {{the top of the}} stairs, he is attacked and murdered. When Lila and Sam do not hear from Arbogast, Sam visits the motel. He finds only Mrs. Bates, who ignores his knocking. Lila and Sam go to the local sheriff, who informs them <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Bates killed herself ten years ago, and concludes that Arbogast lied to confuse them and made off with the $40,000. Still convinced that some ill has befallen Arbogast, Lila and Sam {{make their way to the}} motel. Norman takes his unwilling mother from her room and hides her in the fruit cellar.|$|E
5|$|As in the Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} {{highlight}} {{the differences between}} men and women as much as she emphasizes the importance of virtue in Original Stories. Moreover, she defines virtue in such a way that it applies to both sexes. Traditionally, as Kelly explains, virtue was tied to femininity and chastity, but Wollstonecraft’s text rejects this definition and argues instead that virtue should be characterized by reason and self-control. Myers has also pointed out <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Mason’s desire to instill rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and philosophers such as Rousseau, who asserted the intellectual weakness of women and the secondary status of their gender.|$|E

When the uncle died the nephew refused to pay the widow the money required, arguing that as she was not party to the original agreement she could not benefit from it. The Court of Appeal under Lord Denning tried to use {{this as an opportunity to}} claim that the doctrine of privity was invalid, something the House of Lords rejected. However, the Lords did agree <b>that</b> <b>Mrs</b> Beswick could sue, not as a third party to the contract but as the executrix of her husband's estate.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{two-level}} method accelerated by a minimal residual smoothing (MRS) technique. The two-grid analysis {{is sufficient for}} our purpose because our MRS acceleration scheme is only applied on the finest level of the multigrid method. We prove <b>that</b> the <b>MRS</b> acceleration scheme is a semi-iterative method {{with respect to the}} underlying two-level iteration and <b>that</b> the <b>MRS</b> accelerated two-level method is a polynomial acceleration of first order. We explain why MRS may not effectively accelerate standard multigrid method for solving Poisson-like problems. The iteration matrices for the MRS accelerated coarse-grid-correction operator and the MRS accelerated two-level operator are obtained.

40|$|The major repeat {{sequence}} (MRS) {{is found}} {{at least once}} on all but one chromosome in Candida albicans, but as yet it has no known relation to the phenotype. The MRS affects karyotypic variation by serving as a hot spot for chromosome translocation and by expanding and contracting internal repeats, thereby changing chromosome length. Thus, MRSs on different chromosomes and those on chromosome homologues can differ in size. We proposed <b>that</b> the <b>MRS's</b> unique repeat structure and, more specifically, {{the size of the}} MRS could also affect karyotypic variation by altering the frequency of mitotic nondisjunction. Subsequent analysis shows that both natural and artificially induced differences {{in the size of the}} chromosome 5 MRS can affect chromosome segregation. Strains with chromosome 5 homologues that differ in the size of the naturally occurring MRSs show a preferential loss of the homologue with the larger MRS on sorbose, indicating <b>that</b> a larger <b>MRS</b> leads to a higher risk of mitotic nondisjunction for that homologue. While deletion of an MRS has no deleterious effect on the deletion chromosome under normal growth conditions and leads to no obvious phenotype, strains <b>that</b> have the <b>MRS</b> deleted from one chromosome 5 homologue preferentially lose the homologue with the MRS remaining. This effect on chromosome segregation is the first demonstration of a phenotype associated with the MRS...|$|R

Concealed in her dress was a message from a Union sympathizer who worked in the Navy Yard warning that the former Merrimack, renamed Virginia by the Confederates, was nearing completion. Upon her arrival in Washington Mary managed to meet with Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles and informed him that the Confederates were nearing the completion of their ironclad, which surprised Welles.

40|$|This paper utilises a new {{approach}} for determining minimum variance hedge ratio in stock index futures markets. More specifically, the performance of time-varying hedge ratios generated from Markov Regime Switching (MRS) models is investigated. The rational behind {{the use of these}} models {{stems from the fact that}} the dynamic relationship between spot and futures returns may be characterised by regime shifts, which in turn suggests that by allowing the hedge ratio to be dependent upon the "state of the market", one may obtain more efficient hedge ratios and hence superior hedging performance, compared to other methods in the literature. The performance of the MRS hedge ratios is compared to that of alternative models that have been proposed in the literature such as GARCH, Error Correction and OLS models. In and out-of-sample tests indicate <b>that</b> the <b>MRS</b> hedge ratios outperform the other models in reducing portfolio risk in the FTSE 100 market. In the S&P 500 market the MRS model outperforms the other hedges only within sample. Overall the results indicate <b>that</b> by using <b>MRS</b> models, market agents may be able to increase the performance of their hedges, measured in terms of variance reduction...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} article we {{demonstrate}} stable individual differences in {{the extent to which}} a reliance on logic and evidence in the formation and evaluation of beliefs is perceived as a moral virtue, and a reliance on less rational processes is perceived as a vice. We refer to this individual difference variable as moralized rationality. Eight studies are reported in which an instrument to measure individual differences in moralized rationality is validated. Results show that the Moralized Rationality Scale (MRS) is internally consistent, and captures something distinct from the personal importance people attach to being rational (Studies 1 - 3). Furthermore, the MRS has high test-retest reliability (Study 4), is conceptually distinct from frequently used measures of individual differences in moral values, and it is negatively related to common beliefs that are not supported by scientific evidence (Study 5). We further demonstrate <b>that</b> the <b>MRS</b> predicts morally laden reactions, such as a desire for punishment, of people who rely on irrational (vs. rational) ways of forming and evaluating beliefs (Studies 6 and 7). Finally, we show <b>that</b> the <b>MRS</b> uniquely predicts motivation to contribute to a charity that works to prevent the spread of irrational beliefs (Study 8). We conclude that (1) there are stable individual differences in the extent to which people moralize a reliance on rationality in the formation and evaluation of beliefs, (2) that these individual differences do not reduce to the personal importance attached to rationality, and (3) that individual differences in moralized rationality have important motivational and interpersonal consequences...|$|R
