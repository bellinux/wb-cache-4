The tone of these chapters is especially dark as they deal primarily with the horrific torture {{and death of}} the assassins {{at the hands of}} the SIM, the failure of the coup, the rape of Urania, and the concessions made to Trujillo's most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and then escape the country. The book ends as Urania prepares to return home, determined this <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> in touch with her family back on the island.|$|E
5|$|As {{a player}} {{representative}} to the NHL Players Association since 1990, Linden was responsible for being the contact between his teammates and the NHLPA. He saw the experience {{as a chance to}} be involved in the business side of the sport. In light of this service, Linden was elected President of the NHLPA in June 1998. Consequently, Linden was actively involved in negotiations with Gary Bettman and the NHL on a new CBA that ended the 2004–05 lockout. This included a final meeting in January 2005 between Linden and Harley Hotchkiss, the chairman of the NHL Board of Governors, in an attempt to avoid losing the NHL season. Despite this meeting, a result was not found in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the NHL from cancelling the 2004–05 season.|$|E
5|$|Following William Beebe's {{death in}} 1962, his {{research}} station at Simla remained in operation under Jocelyn Crane's management, {{under the new}} name of the William Beebe Tropical Research Station. However, because Jocelyn's research required her to travel north for extended periods, by 1965 she had little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the station running. By 1971, the station had fallen into disuse and was declared closed. Meanwhile, as Asa Wright's health began to fail in her old age, her friends began to fear that after her death her neighboring estate of Spring Hill might be lost to developers, and established a trust to buy the estate and convert it into the Asa Wright nature center. In 1974, Beebe's property was donated to the newly established Asa Wright Nature Center.|$|E

5|$|On March 2, 1864, Lincoln {{promoted}} Grant to lieutenant general, {{giving him}} command of all Union Armies, answering {{only to the}} President. Grant assigned Sherman the Division of the Mississippi and traveled to Washington to meet with Lincoln to devise a strategy of total war against the Confederacy. Grant established his headquarters with General George Meade's Army of the Potomac in Culpeper, Virginia. Grant developed an overall master plan of five coordinated Union offensives, attacking the rebel armies at the same <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the Confederates from shifting reinforcements within their interior lines. Sherman was to pursue Joseph E. Johnston's Army of Tennessee, while Meade would lead the Army of the Potomac, with Grant in the field, to attack and destroy Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Major General Benjamin Butler was to advance towards Richmond from the south, up the James River, while a joint army-navy operation was to be launched against Mobile, Alabama. If Lee was forced south as expected, Grant would join forces with Butler's armies and be fed supplies from the James. Major General Franz Sigel was to capture the railroad line at Lynchburg, move east, and attack from the Blue Ridge Mountains. Grant knew that Lee had limited manpower and that a war of attrition fought on a battlefield without entrenchments would lead to Lee's defeat.|$|E
5|$|The Assistant Official Assignee, James Walter Davy Ambrose (later a High Court Judge), advised Choor Singh {{to study}} law. Singh read law books in his leisure time and began saving money to study law in England. This {{proved to be}} unnecessary; {{following}} {{a change in the}} rules, he was able to enrol as an external student at the University of London and passed the matriculation examination and, in 1948, the intermediate LL.B. examination. However, he could not be called to the Bar as a barrister as he did not have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the required dining terms. On 20 May 1948, he was appointed a coroner. In December 1949, Singh was elevated to the post of magistrate, becoming the first Indian to hold such a position in colonial Malaya. He continued his law studies at Gray's Inn, and in 1953 was granted leave on a government scholarship to dine at Gray's Inn. After making four trips in two years, he became a Barrister-at-Law in 1955. In 1958, he was appointed a member of the Appeal Tribunal under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} making {{charcoal}} demanded great skill and vast quantities of trees. During winter months, wood was cut and stacked. When colliers selected a site for the hearth, they stacked the wood into a conical shape by standing the sticks on end around a central chimney. The dangerous job of firing and tending these hearths belonged to the collier {{and one or two}} helpers. These men usually managed as many as eight or nine hearths at one <b>time.</b> <b>To</b> <b>keep</b> the fires smoldering, fires were carefully controlled 24 hours a day for ten days to two weeks -the time needed to produce the charred wood or charcoal.|$|E
25|$|At 19:00 {{overheating}} alarm {{was received}} from the cooling water system of the port main engine and its power had to be reduced to half. At times the engine had to be run at full power for short periods of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the bow facing the wind. Shortly after 22:00 {{the speed of the}} starboard main engine suddenly dropped from 1,000 rpm to roughly 270 rpm, but was restored when the engine was declutched from the shaft. When the second engineer closed the clutch at the normal coupling speed of 400 rpm, the engine stalled. After restarting he attempted coupling the engine again at 1,000 rpm, but it still would not run faster than 270 rpm when connected to the shaft. When the captain received a report that the starboard main engine was no longer usable he decided to abandon the ship and ordered the evacuation of the remaining crew at 22:16. The combination turned parallel to the waves with port side facing the wind and began to drift uncontrollably.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{there are}} Dhakis like Dhaki Gokul Chandra Das,of Maslondopur and Ashutosh Colony Habra, North 24 parganas,believs that the Dhak {{is similar to}} any other {{percussion}} instrument played in a concert or a stage performance, such as the Tabla,Pakhwaj,or Mridangam. If a Tabalchi can show case his talent on stage {{in front of a}} large audience, so can a Dhaki....He believes that the dhak can be played in accompaniment to any kind of music,including songs (Rabindra Sangeet), similar to the Tabla,and not just for the Durga Puja or any other puja; and he has proved it. He now participates in stage performances with Pandit Tanmoy Bose and his group of talented musicians. Recently he also performed in a reality TV show,(Sa re Ga Ma Pa,) on Z Bangla, in accompaniment to songs.So it is hard time the Dhakis learnt to use their inheritant music in other ways, to make a living and at the same <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the art of playing the Dhak alive and enchant the world with their magical rhythms at times other than the Durga Puja. People need to recognise the Dhak as a percussion instrument no different than any other percussion instrument that can be seen on stage.|$|E

500|$|The Shin Megami Tensei and Persona art styles {{have been}} defined by two {{different}} artists: Kazuma Kaneko and Shigenori Soejima. Kaneko {{had a long}} history with the series, having done some work on the original Megami Tensei titles. His first prominent work for the series was on Shin Megami Tensei, who worked on both the sprite art and promotional artwork for the game's characters and demons. He was also responsible for suggesting many of the game's darker features, defining the series' eventual identity. Before designing each demon, Kaneko looks up his chosen subject to get their mythological background, and uses that in their design. Many of Kaneko's demon designs were influenced by both creatures and deities from world mythology, and monsters from popular culture like Godzilla. Alongside working on Shin Megami Tensei II, If... and Nocturne, he also did character designs for the first three Persona games. Kaneko's style has been described as [...] "cold [...] stoic", evolving into that state over <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the artwork {{as close as possible to}} the in-game render. He states that he mainly does line drawings for the artwork. He starts his artwork with pencil, and then scans them onto a computer so other artists can work on them digitally.|$|E
500|$|Hassett’s {{winning run}} looked {{at an end}} when Australia was exposed to a sticky wicket in the Third Test. The hosts had reached 2/240 {{at the end of}} the first day before rain hit and made the pitch {{extremely}} difficult for batting. The next day, Hassett had to waste <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> South Africa batting on the poor surface so that Australia’s batsmen would not be exposed to the worst conditions. He then told his bowlers to perform badly so that the hosts would not realise how difficult the pitch was and declare so that Australia would have to face the sticky wicket. Despite Hassett’s subterfuge, the pitch was so poor that South Africa fell to be 311 all out, but Australia had gained extra time. The tourists made only 75, but then dismissed the hosts for 99, Hassett using defensive tactics to slow the scoring and keep South Africa batting as the pitch slowly improved. Australia chased down the target of 336 with five wickets in hand to secure a highly unlikely win. The local newspaper, The Natal Mercury said that [...] "Renowned for their fighting qualities as a cricketers, the occasion brought the best out of the Australians ... That indomitable spirit to win through, no matter what the circumstances may be, was in most marked evidence." ...|$|E
