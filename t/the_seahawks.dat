50|$|Capable {{of being}} fitted with either float or wheeled landing gear, <b>the</b> <b>Seahawk</b> was arguably America's best {{floatplane}} scout of World War II. However, its protracted development time meant it entered service {{too late to}} see significant action in the war. It was not until June 1945, during the pre-invasion bombardment of Borneo, that <b>the</b> <b>Seahawk</b> was involved in military action. By {{the end of the}} war, seaplanes were becoming less desirable, with <b>the</b> <b>Seahawk</b> being replaced soon afterward by helicopters.|$|R

5|$|The Seahawks' CenturyLink Field {{has hosted}} NFL playoff games in 2006, 2008, 2011, 2014, 2015, and 2017. <b>The</b> <b>Seahawks</b> have {{advanced}} to the Super Bowl three times: 2005, 2013 and 2014. They defeated the Denver Broncos 43–8 to win their first Super Bowl championship in Super Bowl XLVIII, but lost 24–28 against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX. <b>The</b> <b>Seahawks</b> also held the NFL playoffs at the Kingdome in 1983, 1984 and 2000. The 2000 playoff game was the last game of football of any type and of any sport at The Kingdome.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{first season}} at {{their new home}} was in 2002. Their first game at the new {{facility}} was a 28–10 preseason loss to the Indianapolis Colts on August 11, 2002. They went on to end their first season at the new field with a 7–9 record. In the 2003 season, the team went undefeated at home and reached the playoffs. It {{was the first time}} the franchise had won 10 games in a single season in 17years. <b>The</b> <b>Seahawks</b> again reached the postseason during the 2004 season and played their first playoff game at CenturyLink Field on January 8, 2005. In that game, they lost to the St. Louis Rams who had already defeated them twice that season. The following season, <b>the</b> <b>Seahawks</b> went undefeated at home for the second time in three years and won their first-ever NFC Championship, but lost in Super Bowl XL. Between 2002 and 2005, <b>the</b> <b>Seahawks</b> won 24 of their 32 regular season games at the stadium.|$|E

This expansion was privately funded by <b>the</b> <b>Seahawks</b> and the 1,000 additional seats were made available to purchase by current season ticket holders the Blue Pride waiting list for season tickets. The additional seating pushed the capacity of the stadium to 69,000-plus.|$|E
5|$|Jones was {{selected}} by the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) with the second pick in the 1946 NFL Draft, but did not sign with the team as he pondered returning to LSU to finish his studies. When the Miami Seahawks of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC) offered him a $12,000 contract, however, he accepted it and joined the team. <b>The</b> <b>Seahawks</b> won just three games in 1946, the AAFC's first season of play, and Jones was traded along with two other players to the Brooklyn Dodgers, another AAFC team, in December. <b>The</b> <b>Seahawks,</b> meanwhile, folded and were moved to Baltimore after the season because of poor attendance and shaky finances. Jones played sparingly for the Dodgers {{in the last three}} games of the 1946 season, rushing for 62 yards on 19 carries.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Seahawks</b> won {{the coin}} toss and kicked off. Before the Bears' first {{offensive}} play, they were penalized for delay of game, and eventually punted. After both teams each traded punts once, Seattle's Richard Sherman utilized a trick punt return, {{similar to one}} the Bears had utilized with Devin Hester and Johnny Knox in the past, to record a 64-yard return to the Bears' 19-yard line. Seattle eventually scored first with Steven Hauschka's 31-yard field goal. Five drives (all of which ended in punts for both teams) later, <b>the</b> <b>Seahawks</b> ended the first half with Hauschka's 21-yarder. Prior to the Seahawks' last drive, controversy over the Bears' last punt arose: after Pat O'Donnell punted, the ball started to bounce out of bounds, but it hit Seahawks linebacker Brock Coyle in the leg, making it available to recover, with defensive back Sherrick McManis taking advantage. However, the officials ruled the punt as downed by McManis, which led to John Fox challenging the call, though it stood. The Bears special teams struggles continued in the second half, when Lockett returned the opening kickoff 105 yards for the touchdown. <b>The</b> <b>Seahawks</b> increased the score with another touchdown later {{in the third quarter}} via Jimmy Graham's 30-yard touchdown catch from Wilson, followed by 45- and 48-yard field goals by Hauschka in the fourth quarter to make the final score 26–0.|$|E

5|$|Bum Phillips {{was fired}} {{three days after}} Houston's loss in the wild-card game, and {{defensive}} coordinator Ed Biles was given the head coaching job. In 1981, the Oilers finished 7–9 and {{failed to make the}} playoffs {{for the first time with}} Campbell on the roster. Also for the first time, Campbell did not claim the rushing yards title, as he finished fifth in yards with 1,376 and seventh in touchdowns with 10. The highlight of the season was back-to-back rushing performances of over 180 yards, against the Bengals in Week 5 and <b>the</b> <b>Seahawks</b> in Week 6. His 39 carries against <b>the</b> <b>Seahawks</b> set an Oilers single-game record. Campbell was invited to his fourth Pro Bowl, but failed to make an All-Pro roster. A players' strike in 1982 shortened the season to nine games and the Oilers finished with a 1–8 record. Campbell had just two touchdowns and 538 rushing yards, an average of 59.8 yards per game—far below his average of 104.1 per game over the previous four seasons.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the stadium}} gained {{national}} attention when the visiting New York Giants committed 11 false start penalties. Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren attributed the penalties to the enthusiasm and {{noise from the}} crowd. He dedicated the ball {{used to make the}} game-winning field goal to the fans, and it is now displayed at the stadium. The Giants' general manager, Ernie Accorsi, asked an NFL senior vice president whether <b>the</b> <b>Seahawks</b> had broadcast artificial crowd noise over the public address system during this game. The NFL sent a memorandum early in the 2006 season about such complaints and sent officials to monitor two games. Holmgren denied the allegations, and the crowd responded by being even louder than usual when the Giants returned to CenturyLink Field. Since 2005 <b>the</b> <b>Seahawks</b> have tracked the number of false starts committed by visiting teams and display the statistic on a scoreboard to motivate the crowd. As of 2013, the stadium has had a league-high number of false starts since. In preparation for 2005–06 NFC Championship Game at CenturyLink Field, the Carolina Panthers practiced with the recorded sounds of jet engines in the background to prepare for the volume of the crowd.|$|E

5|$|Much like Week1 in Chicago {{five years}} back, in Week4 at Seattle, Johnson was {{involved}} in another controversial play. This time, late in the fourth quarter, Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor punched {{the ball out of}} Johnson's hands while he was trying to score a late go-ahead touchdown. Linebacker K. J. Wright then batted the ball out of the end zone for a touchback. The NFL later admitted the referees should have penalized Wright for illegal batting. <b>The</b> <b>Seahawks</b> won the game by a score of 1310.|$|E
5|$|The CenturyLink Field Event Center {{connects to}} the stadium's west field plaza and {{consists}} of two exhibition halls, a conference room, and a concourse.

5|$|The stadium {{was built}} between 2000 and 2002 {{on the site}} of the Kingdome after voters {{approved}} funding for the construction in a statewide election held in June 1997.

5|$|CenturyLink Field often sells out for Seahawks games. Although {{the team}} {{struggled}} in 2008 and 2009, the team maintained its base of season ticket holders. Before the 2008 season, the 14,000 single game tickets not already allotted sold out less than 15 minutes after they became available. By {{the end of}} the 2009 season, <b>the</b> <b>Seahawks</b> had sold out 60 consecutive games.
