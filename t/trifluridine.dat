50|$|Tipiracil is a {{thymidine}} phosphorylase (TPase) inhibitor and inhibits {{degradation of}} <b>trifluridine</b> by inhibiting TPase, thus increasing systemic exposure to <b>trifluridine</b> when tipiracil is given together with <b>trifluridine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tipiracil helps {{maintain}} the blood concentration of <b>trifluridine</b> by inhibiting the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase which metabolizes <b>trifluridine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Trifluridine/tipiracil (trade name Lonsurf) is a {{combination}} drug {{for the treatment of}} metastatic colorectal cancer. It is {{a combination}} of two active pharmaceutical ingredients: <b>trifluridine,</b> a nucleoside analog, and tipiracil, a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor. Tipiracil prevents rapid metabolism of <b>trifluridine,</b> increasing the bioavailability of <b>trifluridine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Only {{in vitro}} {{interaction}} studies are available. In these, <b>trifluridine</b> used the concentrative nucleoside transporter 1 (CNT1) and equilibrative nucleoside transporters 1 (ENT1) and 2 (ENT2). Drugs that interact with these transporters could influence blood plasma concentrations of <b>trifluridine.</b> Being a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, <b>trifluridine</b> could also interact with substrates of this enzyme such as zidovudine.|$|E

50|$|Pharmacokinetic data of oral <b>trifluridine</b> {{have only}} been {{evaluated}} in combination with tipiracil, which significantly affects biotransformation of the former. At least 57% of <b>trifluridine</b> are absorbed from the gut, and highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after two hours in cancer patients. The substance has no tendency to accumulate in the body. Plasma protein binding is over 96%. <b>Trifluridine</b> is metabolised by the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase to 5-trifluoromethyl-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione (FTY), and also by glucuronidation. Elimination half-life is 1.4 hours {{on the first day}} and increases to 2.1 hours on the twelfth day. It is mainly excreted via the kidneys.|$|E

50|$|<b>Trifluridine</b> was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in 1980. It is also {{a component of the}} anti-cancer drug trifluridine/tipiracil, which is taken by mouth.|$|E
5000|$|The drug {{consists}} of the cytotoxin <b>trifluridine</b> and the thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (TPI) tipiracil. [...] <b>Trifluridine</b> is incorporated into DNA during DNA synthesis and inhibits tumor cell growth. <b>Trifluridine</b> (TFT) is incorporated into DNA by phosphorylation by thymidylate kinase (TK) to TF-TMP; [...] TF-TMP then covalently binds to tyrosine 146 of the active site of thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibiting the enzyme's activity. [...] TS {{is vital to the}} synthesis of DNA because it is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the deoxynucleotide, thymidine triphosphate (dTTP). [...] Inhibition of TS depletes the cell of dTTP and causes accumulation of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP), which increases the likelihood that uracil gets misincorporated into the DNA. [...] Also, subsequent phosphorylations of TF-TMP cause an increased level of TF-TTP within the cell, which results in it being incorporated into DNA. [...] Even though the exact mechanism of how TFT causes DNA damage is not completely understood, it is hypothesized that the incorporation TF-TTP in DNA leads to DNA strand break formation.|$|E
50|$|A Cochrane Systematic Review {{showed that}} <b>trifluridine</b> and {{acyclovir}} were {{a more effective}} treatment than idoxuridine or vidarabine, significantly increasing the relative number of successfully healed eyes in 14 days.|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{synthesis}} of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in 1957, fluoropyrimidines have been a useful tool {{in the treatment of}} many types of cancer. Due to the drawbacks of 5-FU therapy, such as having to be administered {{over long periods of time}} via intravenous infusion and the development of resistance in tumors, more convenient and efficacious fluoropyrimidine therapy has been desired. [...] The fluoropyrimidine component of this drug, <b>trifluridine,</b> was first synthesized in 1964 by Heidelberger et al. [...] By the late 1960s, Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of intravenous <b>trifluridine</b> alone initially proved to be disappointing. [...] Its pharmacokinetic profile during these clinical trials showed that the drug exhibited a very short half-life while in serum (12 minutes post-injection). [...] In response to its pharmacokinetic properties, adjustments in the dosing regimen demonstrated significant therapeutic benefits in patients with breast cancer and colon cancer; with this new regimen, doses would be given every three hours to total a daily amount of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 8 to 13 days, and as a result, eight out of 23 breast cancer patients were reported to have a therapeutic response while one in six patients with colon cancer showed a near complete response to therapy. [...] Success of <b>trifluridine</b> as an effective anti-cancer agent was short lived, however, due to rapid tumor recurrence upon regression of therapy. <b>Trifluridine</b> therapy in oncology was thus halted.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trifluridine</b> eye drops {{are used}} for the {{treatment}} of keratitis and keratoconjunctivitis caused by the herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, as well as for prevention and treatment of vaccinia virus infections of the eye.|$|E
50|$|Idoxuridine and <b>Trifluridine</b> are {{variants}} of deoxyuridine used as antiviral drugs. They are similar {{enough to be}} incorporated as part of DNA replication, but they possess side groups on the uracil component (an iodine and a CF3 group, respectively), that prevent base pairing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trifluridine</b> (also called {{trifluorothymidine}} or TFT) is an anti-herpesvirus antiviral drug, {{used primarily}} on the eye. It was sold under the trade name Viroptic by Glaxo Wellcome, now merged into GlaxoSmithKline. The brand is now owned by Monarch Pharmaceuticals, which is wholly owned by King Pharmaceuticals.|$|E
50|$|Researchers {{later found}} out that <b>trifluridine,</b> when taken orally, was broken down into the {{inactive}} metabolites 5-trifluoromethyluracil and 5-trifluoromethyl-2,4(1H,3,H)-pyrimidinedione (FTY) during its extensive first pass {{metabolism in the liver}} via the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase. It was then hypothesized that orally administered FTD concentrations could be increased and maintained if the drug was given with a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor.|$|E
5000|$|Tipiracil {{prevents}} {{the degradation of}} <b>trifluridine</b> via thymidine phosphorylase (TP) when taken orally and also has antiangiogenic properties. [...] Not only has thymidine phosphorylase {{been shown to be}} identical to platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF), which is an endogenous factor involved in the formation of new vasculature, but also the products of the enzyme may contribute to the stimulation of endothelial cell chemotaxis.|$|E
50|$|Epithelial {{keratitis}} {{is treated}} with topical antivirals, {{which are very}} effective with low incidence of resistance. Treatment of the disease with topical antivirals generally should be continued for 10-14 days. Aciclovir ophthalmic ointment and <b>Trifluridine</b> eye drops have similar effectiveness but are more effective than Idoxuridine and Vidarabine eye drops. Oral acyclovir is as effective as topical antivirals for treating epithelial keratitis, {{and it has the}} advantage of no eye surface toxicity. For this reason, oral therapy is preferred by some ophthalmologists.|$|E
5000|$|Nucleoside analogs are a {{class of}} {{antiviral}} drugs that work by inhibiting viral nucleic acid synthesis. The nucleoside analogs acyclovir (ACV), zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC), lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T), <b>trifluridine,</b> cidofovir, adefovir, and tenofovir (TDF) [...] are substrates of the OAT1 transporter. This may result in the buildup of these drugs in the proximal tubule cells. At high concentrations, these drugs inhibit DNA replication. This, in turn, may impair the function of these cells and may {{be the cause of}} antiviral induced Fanconi syndrome. The use of stavudine, didenosine, abacavir, adefovir, cidofovir [...] and tenofovir has been associated with Fanconi syndrome. Clinical features of tenofovir-induced Fanconi syndrome include glycosuria in the setting of normal serum glucose levels, phosphate wasting with hypophosphatemia, proteinuria (usually mild), acidosis, and hypokalemia, with or without acute renal failure.|$|E

40|$|Prolonged topical <b>trifluridine</b> {{treatment}} of herpes simplex keratitis in three elderly patients produced slightly raised dysplastic corneal epithelial lesions. The involved epithelium had a ground-glass appearance and exhibited opaque cells, edema, and spindle-shaped surface cells. Histopathology demonstrated severe cellular atypism, loss of cell polarity, dyskeratosis, parakeratosis, {{and a few}} mitotic figures. The pathological change was apparently intraepithelial. After scraping, the edema and opaque cells in the regenerated epithelium gradually disappeared in 3 - 4 months on cessation of <b>trifluridine</b> therapy. In one patient recurrence of dendritic keratitis, 5 weeks after scraping, was treated by topical bromovinyldeoxyuridine eye drops.

40|$|Liam Daniel Turner, 1 Peter Beckingsale 1, 2, 31 Princess Alexandra Hospital; 2 Terrace Eye Centre; 3 Laser Sight, Brisbane, Queensland, AustraliaPurpose: To {{report a}} case of acyclovir-resistant {{herpetic}} keratitis in a solid-organ lung transplant recipient that was effectively treated with topical <b>trifluridine.</b> Methods: A case of a 35 -year-old female with herpetic epithelial keratitis resistant to acyclovir is described. The patient presented following treatment for 4 weeks with topical acyclovir ointment five times per day and oral valacyclovir 1 g three times per day for herpetic keratitis with no resolution of the epithelial defect or symptoms. Corneal scrapes and swabs were taken for confirmation of the diagnosis and resistance testing. The results were positive for herpes simplex virus 1 and showed acyclovir resistance (inhibitor concentration 90 = 200 &micro;g/mL) and foscarnet sensitivity (inhibitor concentration 90 = 200 &micro;g/mL). The patient was treated with topical <b>trifluridine</b> 2 -hourly for 3 weeks and weaned off the drops over the following week. Results: The patient showed resolution of the epithelial defect, but did have significant corneal toxicity {{associated with the use}} of the <b>trifluridine.</b> At 8 weeks, the patient had some stromal shadowing associated with the recent active infection, but symptoms had settled. Conclusion: This case documents the effective use of topical <b>trifluridine</b> in proven acyclovir-resistant herpetic keratitis. It highlights three things: (1) the importance of considering topical <b>trifluridine</b> as an alternative to topical acyclovir in unresponsive disease; (2) the need to consider solid-organ transplant recipients in the immunocompromised population with resistant herpetic disease, and (3) the need to look for alternatives to treatment of resistant herpetic disease.

40|$|Background. Vaccinia virus {{keratitis}} (VACVK) is a {{complication of}} smallpox vaccination {{that can result}} in blindness. There are no Food and Drug Administration–approved treatments for VACVK, and vaccinia immunoglobulin (VIG) is contraindicated in isolated VACVK. We used a rabbit model of infection to compare several therapeutic options for VACVK. Methods. Rabbit eyes were infected with 105 plaque-forming units of the Dryvax strain of vaccinia virus and scored daily for 28 days using a modified MacDonald-Shadduck scoring system. Animals were treated for 10 days after the onset of keratitis with albumin, VIG, prednisolone acetate, <b>trifluridine,</b> or combinations thereof. Ocular viral titers and vaccinia-specific antibody titers were determined by plaque assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Results. Treatment with intravenous VIG neither exacerbated nor ameliorated VACVK. Topical prednisolone acetate interfered with viral clearance, and ocular disease rebounded in prednisolone-treated groups. The most effective treatment was topical <b>trifluridine</b> alone. Conclusions. We conclude that (1) VIG did not negatively affect the treatment of isolated keratitis, (2) topical corticosteroids {{should not be used}} for treating VACVK, and (3) treatment with topical <b>trifluridine,</b> with or without intravenous VIG, is the preferred therapeutic regimen for treating VACVK...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) {{infection}} is an endemic disease {{and it is}} estimated that 60 - 95 % of the adult population are infected with symptoms that are usually self-limiting, though they can be seri-ous, extensive and prolonged in immunocompromised individuals, highlighted by the emergence of drug-resist-ant strains. The study of the wild-type HSV strains based on the cytopathogenic features and its antiviral sensi-tivity are important in the establishment of an antivirogram for controlling the infection. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to isolate and examine the cytopathological characteristics of circulating strains of the Herpes simplex virus, from clinical specimens and their sensitivity to commercially available antiherpesvirus drugs, acyclovir, phosphonophormic acid and <b>trifluridine.</b> METHODS: Herpes simplex virus isolation, cytopathological features and antiviral sensitivity assays were per-formed in cell culture by tissue culture infectious dose or plaque forming unit assay.

40|$|Herpes simplex ocular {{infection}} {{is a major}} cause of corneal blindness. Local antiviral treatments exist but are associated with corneal toxicity, and resistance has become an issue. We evaluated the biodistribution and efficacy of a humanized anti-herpes simplex virus (anti-HSV) IgG FAb fragment (AC- 8; 53 kDa) following repeated topical administration. AC- 8 was found in the corneal epithelium, anterior stroma, subepithelial stromal cells, and retinal glial cells, with preferential entry through the ocular limbus. AC- 8 was active against 13 different strains of HSV- 1, with 50 % and 90 % mean effective concentrations (MEC(50) and MEC(90), respectively) ranging from 0. 03 to 0. 13 μg/ml, indicating broad-spectrum activity. The in vivo efficacy of AC- 8 was evaluated in a mouse model of herpes-induced ocular disease. Treatment with low-dose AC- 8 (1 mg/ml) slightly reduced the ocular disease scores.
