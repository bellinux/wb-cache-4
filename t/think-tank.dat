5|$|In 1977, Prince Sadruddin, {{together}} with Denis de Rougemont {{and a few}} other friends, established a Geneva-based <b>think-tank,</b> Groupe de Bellerive (named after Bellerive, the municipality where he lived in Geneva), and a non-profit organisation, the Bellerive Foundation.

40|$|<b>Think-tanks</b> are {{prominent}} actors within contemporary policy research. <b>Think-tanks</b> are {{situated in a}} 'space between fields', and draw upon practices from more stable fields of politics, media, academia, and business in producing policy-relevant knowledge. This requires building relationships across and within each field, but problems can arise when <b>think-tanks</b> become overly dependent on any one field. No relationship is more complex and problematic than those with their funders. Though vital, these connections can become sources of pollution – dirty money can produce compromised research. How do <b>think-tanks</b> overcome this inherent tension in their work? Drawing on my mixed method social and personal network analysis of the funding relationships of British <b>think-tanks,</b> I use positioning theory to elucidate how <b>think-tanks</b> actively regulate potential pollution from funders. I suggest <b>think-tanks</b> employ several 'purification strategies', which arise from the personal and organisational networks they have that span the policy-knowledge nexus. Exploiting opportunities presented from their structural marginality, <b>think-tanks</b> attempt to neutralise the symbolic and direct influence of funders by enrolling a diverse network of allies. This paper represents a distinct break from traditional social scientific reflections {{on the relationship between}} <b>think-tanks</b> and funders which hold a priori assumptions about the intellectual labour and credibility of these organisations. More critical scholars presume a unidirectional flow of influence from funder to recipient; more sympathetic accounts underplay these interactions. So far sociologists {{have not been able to}} offer a systematic examination how <b>think-tanks</b> manage funding relationships; this paper seeks to address this gap...|$|R
40|$|How do <b>think-tanks</b> {{influence}} the EU’s policy process? Hartwig Pautz and Dieter Plehwe assess {{the range of}} European <b>think-tanks</b> which are active at the EU level of politics. They {{argue that there is}} a notable lack of ideological diversity among EU <b>think-tanks,</b> with most organisations polarised around the issue of advocating ‘more’ or ‘less’ European integration. There is also a substantial lack of information on the role of <b>think-tanks</b> in influencing policy and no consensus over how they should be classified alongside other interest groups...|$|R
