This sends Ron into a panic, and he continually screams and fights {{with all his}} effort to save her, despite Harry's instruction that he calm down and <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> plan. The trio and some other prisoners are rescued by Dobby, but the house-elf is killed by Bellatrix during the escape. Eventually, the trio returns to Hogwarts, hoping to find the last unknown Horcrux shown in Harry's vision.

[...] Bailey concurred with Hassenger's description of it as bittersweet, writing: [...] "It's an affectionate send-off, bittersweet and kind of wonderful and therefore perfectly in tone with this charming little show." [...] Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed described it as the epitome of the show's various themes, including childhood, art, and family, calling it [...] "a slightly nostalgic episode"; he considered it {{an excellent way to}} close the series, writing [...] "Acting as probably both a reflection of the show's staff at the time and a final send off, I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> way to send Brendon Small and Loren Bouchard's creation into the sunset." ...|$|E

The individual characters are based on people Bramantyo has known or read about. His goal in making the film was to [...] "clarify misleading arguments about Islam" [...] and counter the portrayal of Islam as a [...] "radical religion". In a pre-release press conference, Bramantyo said that ? was not meant to be commercial, but to make a statement. The film, his fourteenth, is one of several Islam-themed movies he has directed, after the polygamous romantic drama Ayat-Ayat Cinta (The Verses of Love; 2008) and the biopic Sang Pencerah (The Enlightener; 2009).|$|E
500|$|Carter was {{inspired}} to write the scene in which Scully splashes water into Doggett's face, since {{he was aware that}} new actor Robert Patrick would be facing opposition from some members of the fan community. The scene was even the first filmed, in order to truly introduce Patrick to the show. After the conclusion of The X-Files television series in 2002, Patrick commented that this part of the episode had been his favorite scene in the series, and admitted that he could not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> way to introduce his character because the scene not only said a lot, but it had actually helped him. Tom Braidwood, who appears in this episode as long-running recurring character Frohike, similarly remarked that the first meeting of Doggett and Scully was one of his favorite scenes from the entire series. Both Robert Patrick and the director of this episode, Kim Manners, felt that it was the perfect introduction to the character of John Doggett {{as the leader of the}} taskforce sent to find Mulder. Manners stated that Patrick gave a new [...] "sense of energy" [...] to the show, since they had basically used the same characters for seven years.|$|E

A reviewer from The Economist called the story [...] "engaging", saying that it provided a [...] "memorable and thought-provoking experience". In {{an analysis of the}} game's story, Emily Short of Gamasutra called the decision to leave the protagonist blank rather than writing a viewpoint character [...] "brilliant", saying that it made the entire game work much better than it otherwise would. A reviewer from The A.V. Club, grading the game as an [...] "A", called the story [...] "moving". The majority of the criticism for the game was in regards to the interface used to navigate the online world; while The Economist found it quirky and realistic, Gillen felt that it made it easy for the player to miss a key message, leaving the player stuck with no direction as to where to turn.|$|E

He stated, [...] "First I heard from friends, people who had read the script, some other cast members. I think I said laughingly, [...] "So did I survive?" [...] They just gave me a look, and I was like, [...] "Whaat?" [...] Then I had the call from David and Dan, the fateful call everyone gets when your number's up.

[...] Indiewire said, [...] "As Dredd, Urban either has a better character to play than [...] did, or simply has a better grasp on what makes him tick, but the actor continues to distinguish himself as a versatile performer who turns mimicry into emotional meaning." [...] Empires Chris Hewitt scored the film three out of five stars, and said it gets the lead character [...] "absolutely, incontrovertibly right" [...] and that Urban's Dredd is [...] "a deadpan delight—he doesn't grow {{as a person and}} he doesn't crack wise...the movie generates its few laughs from his sheer intractability". Hewitt also called Thirlby's Anderson engaging and wrote that the film is [...] "a solid, occasionally excellent take on , with Urban's chin particularly impressive." [...] Varietys Geoff Berkshire said the film is [...] "Grim, gritty and ultra-violent", called Dredd a [...] "badass of few words", and wrote that Urban [...] "does a fine job embodying the more mythic qualities of Dredd as an upright law enforcer no lowlife would want to confront." [...] He also praised Thirlby for carrying the film's emotional story and said, [...] "one of the film's true thrills comes in watching Thirlby effortlessly balance the conflict between a Judge's merciless duties and a psychic's compassionate understanding." ...|$|E
5000|$|While Leibniz does {{state this}} {{universe}} {{is the best}} possible version of itself, the standard for goodness does not seem clear to many of his critics. To Leibniz, the best universe means {{a world that is}} “the simplest in hypotheses and the richest in phenomena”, in addition to the “happiness of minds” being God’s main goal. Voltaire, Bertrand Russell, and other critics seem to equate goodness of the universe to no evil or evil acts whatsoever, presuming that a universe that did not contain evil would be [...] "better" [...] and that God could have created such a universe, but chose not to. According to Leibniz, that is not the case. He believes that if <b>a</b> <b>better</b> alternative existed “God would have brought it into actuality”. Essentially, Leibniz affirms that no human can truly <b>think</b> up <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> universe because they lack <b>a</b> holistic understanding <b>of</b> the universe, and God, who has that holistic understanding, has already chosen the best option. All of this shifts the meaning of goodness from morality and actions to the quality and phenomena of this universe’s existence. Despite that, the concept of the goodness of the universe is still <b>a</b> point <b>of</b> major contention in Leibniz’s argument, as someone could always argue about the lack of goodness in the universe based on those parameters ...|$|R

[...] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "Continuing in the vein of Madonna in 2012, Beyoncé steered the Super Bowl halftime show away from dad rock to embrace girl power." [...] Melinda Newman of the website HitFix commented: [...] "In a Super Bowl half-time performance that was as frenetic as it was fierce, Beyoncé delivered a sexy segment that was part Victoria's Secret fashion show, part tutorial on how to dazzle an audience." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times praised the performance at the show, commenting that [...] "for 12 or so minutes... she balanced explosions and humanity, imperiousness with warmth, <b>an</b> arena-ready sense <b>of</b> scale with <b>a</b> microscopic approach {{to the details of}} her vocals. Amid all the loudness were small things to indicate Beyoncé was answering her skeptics, quietly but effectively." [...] He finished his review with the conclusion that Beyoncé [...] "the machine had made her point" [...] and that the {{performance was}} [...] "proof of life". Jim Farber of Daily News wrote in his review of the performance that [...] "It's hard to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> star <b>better</b> suited to the Super Bowl than she is". Dan Hyman of Rolling Stone magazine wrote in his review that Beyoncé [...] "flaunted her supreme vocal and dancing chops throughout the halftime show" [...] and added that the set's biggest moment was when she was joined on stage by her former bandmates. Rob Sheffield of the same publication praised the performance of Beyoncé's guitarist Bibi McGil during the show, commenting that it was a [...] "ready-made obligatory-Slash-cameo guitar solo".
