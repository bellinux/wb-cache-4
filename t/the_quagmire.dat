In September 2016, {{it was revealed}} that Dylan Kingwell and Avi Lake were cast as <b>the</b> <b>Quagmire</b> siblings, Duncan and Isadora, respectively. In November 2016, Handler revealed Catherine O'Hara, Don Johnson, and Alfre Woodard had been cast as Dr. Georgina Orwell, Sir, and Aunt Josephine, respectively; O'Hara had previously portrayed Justice Strauss in the 2004 film adaptation of A Series of Unfortunate Events. It was also revealed that Presley Smith would play Sunny Baudelaire, whose quasi-nonsensical lines are voiced by Tara Strong, and Rhys Darby would play Charles, Sir's partner.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed around three British Columbian lakes: Buntzen Lake, north of Coquitlam; Pitt Lake, north of Pitt Meadows; and Rice Lake, {{part of the}} Seymour Demonstration Forest. Buntzen Lake was used for shots of <b>the</b> <b>quagmire</b> reeds. Pitt Lake was used for shots of the boat dock and Ted's Bait and Tackle Shop. Finally, Rice Lake and the Seymour Demonstration Forest {{were used for the}} final scene, {{featuring}} a discreet shot of Big Blue. The conversation scene was filmed on a [...] "Rocky Island Set" [...] at B.C. Research Wave Tank. During the day of filming, the artificial rock set was placed in the tank and filled with water. However, the rock set began to float and [...] "an emergency crew of carpenters [...] worked furiously through the night" [...] to reattach the platform. The scene of Big Blue {{at the end of the}} episode was originally intended to feature a rubber sea serpent pulled through the water by a boat, but the producers were unhappy with how it turned out. Originally, they tried enhancing the image digitally but were still unhappy with the shot, so the entire scene was scrapped and Big Blue was created entirely by digital effects.|$|E
2500|$|The final {{was played}} on 14 August in bad conditions. [...] The contest was played outdoors, {{on a dirt}} court in a driving rain. Due to <b>the</b> <b>quagmire,</b> the teams could not dribble and the score was held to a minimum. Highest scorer in the game was Joe Fortenberry for the United States with 7 points. In addition, there were no seats for spectators and the nearly 1,000 in {{attendance}} had {{to stand in the}} rain throughout the entire game.|$|E
25|$|The Baudelaires go see <b>the</b> <b>Quagmires</b> {{and tell}} them what happened. Then <b>the</b> <b>Quagmires</b> plot a plan. <b>The</b> <b>Quagmires</b> {{disguise}} themselves as Klaus and Violet, get a sack of flour to represent Sunny, and do the exercises (at night) so that the Baudelaire orphans can study and make staples (Coach Genghis doesn't know that it's <b>the</b> <b>Quagmires</b> that are running because it is night time and he can't see them.) <b>The</b> <b>Quagmires</b> leave their notebooks with Violet and Klaus so that they can study. Violet invents a staple-making device (using a small crab, a potato, metal rods, creamed spinach, and a fork) and makes staples while Klaus reads the notebooks out loud.|$|R
50|$|Klaus finds a Lot #50, V.F.D., in {{the auction}} catalog. The Baudelaires {{believe this is}} <b>the</b> item <b>the</b> <b>Quagmires</b> will be hidden in, because <b>the</b> <b>Quagmires</b> had told them (at the end of The Austere Academy) that Count Olaf was {{involved}} in a secret called V.F.D. The Baudelaires tell Esmé about this, but it is revealed that Esmé knew who Gunther was, and was actually in on the plan to kidnap <b>the</b> <b>Quagmires.</b> When <b>the</b> Baudelaires show her the ersatz elevator, she pushes them down the empty shaft. They land halfway down in a net.|$|R
50|$|At {{this point}} they flee the pitchfork-carrying mob {{and run for}} the {{outskirts}} of town. As they go, <b>the</b> <b>Quagmires</b> explain that Count Olaf locked them in the tower of his house. Then he had his associates build the fountain and imprisoned <b>the</b> <b>Quagmires.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Quagmires</b> attached a couplet to the crows' feet every morning, which fell off in the Nevermore Tree when the paper was dry. They tell the Baudelaires {{that the man who}} died was Jacques Snicket, but the mob catches sight of them and they have to continue to run.|$|R
2500|$|Within various {{phases of}} the Holocaust, the trains were {{employed}} differently. At first, {{they were used to}} concentrate the Jewish populations in the ghettos, and often to transport them to forced labour and German concentration camps for the purpose of economic exploitation. In 1939 for logistical reasons the Jewish communities in settlements without railway lines in occupied Poland were dissolved. By the end of 1941, about 3.5 million Polish Jews had been segregated and ghettoised by the SS in a massive deportation action involving the use of freight trains. Permanent ghettos had direct railway connections, because the food aid (paid by the Jews themselves) was completely dependent on the SS similar to all newly built labour camps. Jews were legally banned from baking bread. They were sealed off from the general public in hundreds of virtual prison-islands called Jüdischer Wohnbezirk or Wohngebiet der Juden. However, the new system was unsustainable. By the end of 1941, most ghettoised Jews had no savings left to pay the SS for further bulk food deliveries. <b>The</b> <b>quagmire</b> was resolved at the Wannsee conference of 20 January 1942 near Berlin, where the [...] "Final Solution of the Jewish question" [...] (die Endlösung der Judenfrage) was set in place. It was a euphemism referring to the Nazi plan for the annihilation of the Jewish people.|$|E
2500|$|With Rollins, Black Flag {{began work}} on their first {{full-length}} album. The sessions for the album (chronicled in Michael Azerrad's book Our Band Could Be Your Life) were a source of conflict between the band and engineer/producer Spot, {{who had worked with}} the band and the SST label since their early years. Spot had already recorded many of the Damaged tracks with Dez Cadena on vocals (as well as Keith Morris and Ron Reyes) and felt that the band's sound was ruined with the two guitar line-up (these versions can be heard on the albums Everything Went Black and The First Four Years). Whereas the earlier four-piece versions are more focused and much cleaner sounding, the Damaged recordings are more akin to a live recording, with little stereo separation of guitars, and somewhat muddy. When asked about the lo-fidelity production, Spot has said [...] "They wanted it to sound that way." [...] However, the artistic content and expression on the album showed the band pushing punk or hardcore music to a new level, with deeply personal and intensely emotional lyrics. As such, Damaged is generally regarded as Black Flag's most focused recording. One critic has written that Damaged was [...] "perhaps the best album to emerge from <b>the</b> <b>quagmire</b> that was early-'80s California punk ... the visceral, intensely physical presence of Damaged has yet to be equaled, although many bands have tried." [...] Damaged was released in the fall of 1981, and the group began an extensive tour in support of it, forging an independent network for touring independent music acts that would form a cornerstone of the independent music scene for the decade to come.|$|E

5000|$|Klaus {{notices that}} there is one {{elevator}} door on each floor except for the top floor, which has two. The children discover that the extra elevator is [...] "ersatz", fake, and consists of nothing but an empty shaft. They climb down the shaft, to find <b>the</b> two <b>Quagmire</b> triplets trapped in a cage at the bottom of <b>the</b> shaft. <b>The</b> <b>Quagmires</b> say that Count Olaf is planning to smuggle them out of the city by hiding them as an object at the [...] "In" [...] auction, which one of his associates will bid on. The Baudelaires return to the penthouse to find tools with which they can free <b>the</b> <b>Quagmires,</b> but they return to find that Gunther has cast <b>the</b> <b>Quagmires</b> away already. They return, dispirited, to the penthouse.|$|R
2500|$|The Baudelaire orphans tell Mr. Poe that Coach Genghis is Count Olaf. Coach Genghis {{runs out}} of the shack, and after the orphans manage to remove his disguise, he succeeds in {{kidnapping}} <b>the</b> <b>Quagmires.</b> <b>The</b> two lunch ladies remove their metal masks and reveal themselves as Count Olaf's assistants, the white-faced women. The orphans see Olaf's assistants shoving <b>the</b> <b>Quagmires</b> into an old car. Before they close the door, Duncan yells to the Baudelaire orphans [...] "Look in the notebooks! V.F.D.!" [...] before they are captured. Unfortunately, Olaf steals the notebooks before he and his henchmen drive away. The orphans wept in the lawn by Mr. Poe because they miss their friends.|$|R
60|$|The {{place which}} the boys called <b>the</b> <b>quagmire,</b> {{was a low}} place in the pathway, where it was almost always muddy. This pathway {{was made by the}} cows, going up and down to drink; and it was a good, dry, and hard path in all places but one. This, in the spring of the year, was very wet and miry; and, during the whole summer, it was seldom {{perfectly}} dry. The boys called it <b>the</b> <b>quagmire,</b> and they used to get by on one side, in among the bushes.|$|E

50|$|They {{reach the}} {{outskirts}} of town and Hector arrives in his hot-air mobile home. He throws down a rope ladder and <b>the</b> <b>Quagmires</b> start to climb up to get inside. Officer Luciana shoots at the rope ladder with a harpoon gun, breaking the rope whilst the Baudelaires are still climbing and preventing them from continuing - they jump down to earth, saying good-bye to <b>the</b> <b>Quagmires,</b> who then throw their notebooks down to the orphans so they can read their research. Officer Luciana's final harpoon pierces the books, destroying and scattering many of the pages, as the hot-air mobile home heads towards the horizon.|$|R
5000|$|The Baudelaires {{figure out}} a number of things: The sapphires refer to the Quagmires' fortune. <b>The</b> <b>Quagmires</b> way of [...] "speaking" [...] to the Baudelaire orphans is not V.F.D., but the first letter in each verse, which spells out FOUNTAIN.

The children ask Jerome to buy them Lot #50. Mr. Poe and Jerome both bid and then back down, but Sunny bids on it and wins. The Baudelaires open the box, only to reveal Very Fancy Doilies. Gunther slips on the doilies and is revealed as Count Olaf when his boots and monocle fly off, revealing his unibrow and tattoo. Count Olaf and Esmé flee, pursued by the audience. The doorman is revealed as the Hook-Handed Man, and <b>the</b> <b>Quagmires</b> are hidden in the statue of a red herring. Although Jerome wants to keep the Baudelaires, he insists on taking them far away so Count Olaf will not bother them.

5000|$|The Austere Academy is {{the fifth}} novel in A Series of Unfortunate Events. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are sent to Prufrock Preparatory School, an academy overseen by the tyrannic Vice Principal Nero. While treated poorly and {{confined}} to a shack outside the dormitories, the children befriend fellow students and triplets Duncan and Isadora Quagmire, who lost their brother and parents in a fire similar to the Baudelaires'. All five children are persistently taunted by their obnoxious classmate Carmelita Spats. When <b>the</b> <b>Quagmires</b> learn of <b>the</b> Baudelaires' troubles and note the similarity of their plights, the triplets begin to research Count Olaf in the school library's records. Olaf soon arrives disguised as Genghis, the school's new gym teacher.

Finally Nero announces {{that if they do}} not each pass a special exam, they will be expelled and placed in private tutoring with Genghis. On the night before <b>the</b> exams, <b>the</b> <b>Quagmires</b> disguise themselves as the Baudelaires (using a bag of flour for Sunny) and take their places for S.O.R.E., leaving Violet, Klaus, and Sunny to study for their exams.

It was <b>the</b> <b>quagmire</b> into which thoughts of Adrea had led him; a parable sent to show him the folly of such thoughts, and whither they tended. He laughed a little bitterly at the thought. Once, when a very young man, he had thought himself a fatalist. After all, perhaps it was the best thing to be!
