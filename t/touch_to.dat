5|$|Although {{used before}} his presidency, Roosevelt used {{military}} muscle several times throughout his two terms {{with a more}} subtle <b>touch</b> <b>to</b> complement his diplomatic policies and enforcing the Monroe Doctrine throughout multiple interventions in Latin America. This included the Great White Fleet, 16 battleships which peacefully circumnavigated the globe as an illustration of United States' rising yet neutral prestige under Roosevelt's direction.|$|E

5|$|He {{took one}} <b>touch</b> <b>to</b> control a long 60-yard aerial pass from Frank de Boer, brought {{the ball down}} through Argentine defender Roberto Ayala's legs, and finally {{finished}} by firing a volley with the outside of his right foot, past keeper Carlos Roa at a tight angle from the right. The goal, cited by Bergkamp as his favourite in his career, was his 36th for the national team, overtaking Faas Wilkes as the record goalscorer. In the semi-finals, the Netherlands lost to Brazil on penalties after drawing 1–1 in normal time. Bergkamp made the All-Star team of the tournament, alongside Frank de Boer and Edgar Davids.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Saran {{appeared}} in Rowthiram, {{where she worked}} with Tamil actor Jeeva for the first time. The film received fairly low reviews. Although some reviews said that Saran was not given much opportunity to show her acting skills, mainly just adding a romantic <b>touch</b> <b>to</b> a mostly violent film, she was referred to by another as the pivot around which the film revolves. Her performance earned her Best Actress Award at the International Tamil Film Awards. Her only other film in 2011 was a special appearance in a song for the Tamil film Rajapattai.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, Wenger offered Sheffield United {{a replay}} of their FA Cup fifth round match {{immediately}} after the match had finished, due to the controversial circumstances {{in which it was}} won. The decisive goal was scored by Overmars after Kanu failed to return the ball to the opposition; it was kicked into <b>touch</b> <b>to</b> allow Sheffield United's Lee Morris to receive treatment for an injury. Arsenal {{went on to win the}} replayed match 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Madgulkar did {{not make}} any attempt to provide new {{interpretation}} or meaning to the Ramayana but told the same story in the simpler and poetic format. With inclusion of characters like Ahalya and Shabari, he included the sentiments of religious devotion (Bhakti) and also gave divine <b>touch</b> <b>to</b> the story while describing the marriage of Sita and Rama as a union of Maya and Brahman. He composed songs on all seven chapters or Kāṇḍa of Ramayana. Out of 56 songs, poet composed twelve songs on Balakanda, seven on Ayodhya Kanda, fourteen on Aranya Kanda, three on Kishkindha Kanda, four on Sundara Kanda, twelve on Yuddha Kanda and three on Uttara Kanda.|$|E

5|$|At a {{young age}} Saint-Just had shown a fascination with literature, and during his stay at the {{reformatory}} he used his time to begin writing a lengthy poem. He published it anonymously {{more than two years}} later, in May 1789, at the very outbreak of the Revolution. The 21-year-old Saint-Just thereby added his own <b>touch</b> <b>to</b> the social tumult of the times with Organt, poem in twenty cantos. The poem, a medieval epic fantasy, relates the quest of young Antoine Organt. It extols the virtues of primitive man, praising his libertinism and independence while blaming all present-day troubles on modern inequalities of wealth and power. Written in a style mimicking Ariosto, it gave a juvenile foreshadowing of his own political extremism. Spiked with brutal satire and scandalous pornographic episodes, it also made unmistakable attacks upon the monarchy, the nobility, and the Church.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like the}} player's pilot, {{most of the}} other {{characters}} are low-key. The non-player character Admiral Aken Bosch, however, plays a crucial part in moving the story. As a prominent antagonist from the start, he sparks off a rebellion which escalates the scale of action, and brings in the other antagonist force, the Shivans, into the story. The storytelling took on a character-driven approach with expositions taking the form of cutscenes in which Bosch gives out monologues, revealing the purpose and driving forces behind his actions. A few established voice actors were brought in to give a polished <b>touch</b> <b>to</b> the voices in the game. Academy Award nominee Robert Loggia voiced the player's commanding officer, Admiral Petrarch, and Admiral Bosch was voiced by Ronny Cox. Kurtwood Smith and Stephen Baldwin participated in bit roles as well.|$|E
5|$|The literary, {{as well as}} the historical, {{value of}} the Historia Augusta has {{suffered}} greatly {{as a result of the}} method of its composition. In the arrangement in categories of the historical material, the authors did but follow the accepted principles of the art of biography as practised in antiquity, but their narratives, consisting often of mere excerpts arranged without regard to connexion or transition, lack grace and even cohesion. The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, without adding anything of historical value or even of general interest. Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no connexion, has put the crowning <b>touch</b> <b>to</b> the awkwardness and incoherence of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge seems almost justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.|$|E

25|$|It is more {{acceptable}} {{for women to}} touch than men in social or friendship settings, possibly because of the inherent dominance of the person touching over the person being touched. Whitcher and Fisher conducted a study to see whether therapeutic <b>touch</b> <b>to</b> reduce anxiety differed between the sexes. A nurse was told to touch patients for one minute while the patients looked at a pamphlet during a routine preoperative procedure. Females reacted positively to the touch, whereas males did not. It was surmised that males equated the <b>touch</b> <b>to</b> being treated as inferior or dependent.|$|E

5000|$|Third-Class Relics: any {{object that}} is <b>touched</b> <b>to</b> a first- or second-class relic. Most third-class relics are {{small pieces of}} cloth, though in the first {{millennium}} oil was popular; the Monza ampullae contained oil collected from lamps burning before the major sites of Christ's life, and some reliquaries had holes for oil to be poured in and out again. Many people call the cloth <b>touched</b> <b>to</b> the bones of saints [...] "ex brandea". But ex brandea strictly refers to pieces of clothing that were <b>touched</b> <b>to</b> the body or tombs of the apostles. It is a term that is used only for such; {{it is not a}} synonym for a third-class relic.|$|R

25|$|Managers {{should know}} the {{effectiveness}} of using touch while communicating to subordinates, but need to be cautious and understand how touch can be misunderstood. A hand on the shoulder for one person may mean a supportive gesture, while it could mean a sexual advance to another person. Working with others and using <b>touch</b> <b>to</b> communicate, a manager needs {{to be aware of}} each person’s touch tolerance.|$|E
