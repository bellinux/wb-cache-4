It is recommended to keep a considerable distance from these phenomena, and <b>to</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> on alert through weather reports. The United States National Weather Service will often issue special marine warnings when waterspouts are likely or have been sighted over coastal waters, or tornado warnings when waterspouts are expected to move onshore.|$|E

The damage from the F4 tornado that struck Comfrey is the strongest ever measured in Minnesota during the month of March.

25|$|Each curve may {{pass through}} itself during this motion, {{but the two}} curves must remain {{separated}} throughout. This is formalized as regular homotopy, which further requires that each curve be an immersion, not just any map. However, this added condition {{does not change the}} definition of linking number (it does not matter if the curves are required <b>to</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> immersions or not), which is an example of an h-principle (homotopy-principle), meaning that geometry reduces to topology.|$|E

25|$|The {{harshness}} and {{unpredictability of}} life in the Arctic ensured that Inuit lived with concern for the uncontrollable, where a streak of bad luck could destroy an entire community. To offend a spirit was to risk its interference with an already marginal existence. The Inuit understood that they had to work in harmony with supernatural powers to provide the necessities of day-to-day life. Before the 1940s, Inuit had minimal contact with Europeans, who passed through on their way to hunt whales or trade furs but seldom had any interest in settling down on the frozen land of the Arctic. So the Inuit had the place to themselves. They moved between summer and winter camps <b>to</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> living where there were animals to hunt.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{philosophy}} of Courtney stroke {{is to keep}} the oars (sculls or sweep) in the water as long as possible and in the air as short as possible. To do this, Courtney taught his rowers to sharply lower the hands to the lap when the preceding stroke is finished. This forced the blade of the oar out of the water perpendicular to the surface. Then he required his rowers to quickly shoot their arms forward moving the blade back to start another stroke. He emphasized that the blade should be {{as close as possible to}} the water. He wanted the blade to enter the water at slight inclined to the surface of the water to allow it to enter cleanly. Once the blade entered the water, he taught his rowers to immediately start the stroke. During the stroke he wanted the blade <b>to</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> covered but not sunk too deep.|$|E

25|$|Azusa {{participants}} {{returned to}} their homes carrying their new experience with them. In many cases, whole churches were converted to the Pentecostal faith, but many times Pentecostals were forced to establish new religious communities when their experience {{was rejected by the}} established churches. One of the first areas of involvement was the African continent, where, by 1907, American missionaries were established in Liberia, as well as in South Africa by 1908. Because speaking in tongues was initially believed <b>to</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> actual foreign languages, it was believed that missionaries would no longer have to learn the languages of the peoples they evangelized because the Holy Spirit would provide whatever foreign language was required. (When the majority of missionaries, to their disappointment, learned that tongues speech was unintelligible on the mission field, Pentecostal leaders were forced to modify their understanding of tongues.) Thus, as the experience of speaking in tongues spread, a sense of the immediacy of Christ's return took hold and that energy would be directed into missionary and evangelistic activity. Early Pentecostals saw themselves as outsiders from mainstream society, dedicated solely to preparing the way for Christ's return.|$|E
25|$|The Warrior of Light and Aymeric's long-delayed dinner date is {{interrupted}} by news of Alisaie, Alphinaud's twin sister, arriving injured at House Fortemps. She was attacked by the Warriors of Darkness, having overheard their plot to trigger an arms race of primal summoning. After the Scions stop the Ixali summoning, the Warriors of Darkness reveal that their cooperation with the Ascians aims to bring Hydaelyn {{to the point of}} destruction to restore their own home world. The Scions stymie similar efforts among the Gnath and Kobolds. Tracking down another lead among Ala Mhigan refugees, they are reunited with Yda and Papalymo, who had joined the Resistance efforts against the Garlean Empire. A man known as the Griffin has captivated the ears and hearts of the refugees, inspiring them to flock to his call to arms. He points the party to an impending summoning of Ifrit, which {{turns out to be a}} trap. During the battle, one of the Warriors of Darkness reveals himself as Urianger, playing double agent. He invokes a ritual to gain an audience with Hydaelyn's avatar, Minfilia. At Urianger's suggestion, she accompanies the Warriors of Darkness to their home world to return the excess Light that threatens to erase it to the Mothercrystal. With the primal threat quelled, the reunified Scions of the Seventh Dawn move forward, their goal <b>to</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> ready to defend Eorzea.|$|E
25|$|Antony and Cleopatra {{was never}} {{intended}} to be a tragedy; instead, Shakespeare gave the illusion of the tragedy as the two protagonists set out to become the heroes of the play and neither succeeded. Antony and Cleopatra are seen to have a passionate love for each other up till their demise as both are seen ending their lives for the other. Although the couple was seen as a pair that could not live without the other, it does not take much to be able {{to point out that the}} basis of their relationship lies on manipulation and lust. Enobarbus was able to see this as he never believed their love was true but instead a contradiction. Cleopatra always wanted Antony to be in the palm of her hands, <b>to</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> in control of his emotions and would thus manipulate him by dancing whenever he was sad or fake a sickness if he were to be happy. This makes Antony only chase after Cleopatra even more in a never-ending cycle. They both try to be much more than they are and show their enemies and the world that they are invincible. Rather than them sacrificing themselves for the other, the two protagonists set out to become the hero of the play and to show that being the last one standing, no hand will bring them down but their own. They did not die for love but for the fame that would come behind that sacrifice and in the end are seen as being noble and self-sacrificing. It does not end in a tragedy but in a bittersweet and almost happy ending.|$|E

25|$|As noted, a {{few months}} after his {{appointment}} as ABA President Ehnat was fired by the ABA under bad circumstances and was replaced by the new ABA management by Clayton John, a former motorcycle racer and BMX track operator and who is still the current (2006) ABA President. Ehnat became Vice President of the USBA and became active in the campaign to shore up the image of the USBA which was beginning to take damaging hits in the BMX industry, including its dealings with disgraced BMX promoter Renny Roker. Bob Hadley*, team manager of the Huffy BMX team noticed at one time that Erhart was pretty prescient in questions he had with him even before he mentioned them. At the time only Clayton John was privy to the specific concerns in a letter Mr. Hadley had that he had shared only with Mr. John at the time. The timing of Ehnat responses {{and the fact that the}} USBA seemed <b>to</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> one step ahead of the ABA in court actions was so uncanny Mr. Hadley joked that someone must have bugged Mr. John's office. Clayton John took the whimsical joke seriously and had ABA headquarters swept for bugs by experts in counter surveillance and corporate espionage. After the sweep, two experts, one a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent and the other a former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent found evidence of tampering in one of the telephone trunk lines leading to Mr. John's office. The lines were stripped in a way that it was evidence that a telephone tap was in place at some time. No conclusive proof only circumstantial evidence has suggested that the USBA was responsible. Another suspect, the IRS could have done it given the pressure they put the ABA under, including showing up during ABA nationals but aside from it being illegal without a court order, the IRS had perfectly legal ways available to them to get once sensitive information about the ABA, including financial assets. Most of it was public record particularly court proceedings. The IRS had no real motive to go through the unnecessary risk of wire-tapping the ABA offices.|$|E

The plot of the episode is unrelated to the short story, although there are allusions present.

500|$|There {{are many}} traditions and customs {{that have been}} an {{important}} part of Indian culture for hundreds of years. Religious laws and expectations, or [...] "personal laws" [...] enumerated by each specific religion, often conflict with the Indian Constitution, eliminating rights and powers women should legally have. [...] Despite these crossovers in legality, the Indian government does not interfere with religion and the personal laws they hold. Indian society is largely composed of hierarchical systems within families and communities. [...] These hierarchies can be broken down into age, sex, ordinal position, kinship relationships (within families), and caste, lineage, wealth, occupations, and relationship to ruling power (within the community). [...] When hierarchies emerge within the family based on social convention and economic need, girls in poorer families suffer twice the impact of vulnerability and stability. [...] From birth, girls are automatically entitled to less; from playtime, to food, to education, girls can expect <b>to</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> entitled to less than their brothers. [...] Girls also have less access to their family's income and assets, which is exacerbated among poor, rural Indian families. [...] From the start, it is understood that females will be burdened with strenuous work and exhausting responsibilities {{for the rest of their}} lives, always with little to no compensation or recognition.|$|E
