5|$|Hunting is {{permitted}} {{in most of}} Black Moshannon State Park. It helps <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> overpopulation of animals and the resulting overbrowsing of the understory. The most common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrel, wild turkey, and white-tailed deer. However, the hunting of groundhogs is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> {{attack on}} the undefended Maryland side of the Potomac, Brigadier General John G.

At the crucial western end of the Heights would be the then-unnamed Fort Greble.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent {{research}} and debate has pointed to Overton as a scapegoat for an informal policy of US pilots regularly violating the Yalu River border into China, {{and that the}} US military discredited Overton as a way <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> international incident. Overton was finally given the medals he had earned in the war—including a Distinguished Service Cross and four Silver Stars—in 2009.|$|E
5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage. One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E

Instead, Boone promised that Boonesborough would surrender willingly to the Shawnees the following spring. Boone did not have an opportunity to tell his men that he was bluffing <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> immediate attack on Boonesborough, however. Boone pursued this strategy so convincingly that many of his men concluded that he had switched his loyalty to the British.|$|E
5|$|Burston {{believed}} in personal reconnaissance and {{leading from the}} front. He was {{at the forefront of}} providing the medical arrangements for Operation Compass. He attempted, in the face of equipment shortages, to anticipate medical problems and so far as possible to prevent or avoid them. He dispatched Major Ian Murray Mackerras to investigate fly breeding in order <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> outbreak of diarrhoea. Burston gave Mackerras a free hand to tackle hygiene problems.|$|E
5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply blood to the vital organs, and the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E

5|$|GoldenEye (1995) is {{the seventeenth}} spy {{film in the}} James Bond series to be {{produced}} by Eon Productions, {{and the first to}} star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming. The story was conceived and written by Michael France, with later collaboration by other writers. In the film, Bond fights <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> ex-MI6 agent, gone rogue, from using a satellite against London to cause a global financial meltdown.|$|E
5|$|If {{a runner}} {{advances}} because the defense {{does nothing to}} try to stop the advance, the scorer may rule that the advance was due to defensive indifference and no stolen base is credited. However, a throw is not required for a stolen base. If a fielder begins to visibly make an attempt <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> advance but then elects not to throw, the advance is not due to defensive indifference.|$|E
5|$|In 1757, Lembi Battery {{was added}} near Tigné Point, Sliema. The battery {{was funded by}} the Manoel Foundation and it was {{considered}} to be an outwork of Fort Manoel, since it was intended <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> enemy from bombarding the fort's northern flank. It was decommissioned following the construction of Fort Tigné in 1795. The construction of the latter fort was also partially funded by the Manoel Foundation.|$|E

5|$|In 1945 Ole Lippman, {{leader of}} the Danish section of the Special Operations Executive, invited the British Royal Air Force to assist their {{operations}} by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen. Accordingly, Air Vice-Marshal Sir Basil Embry drew up plans for a spectacular precision attack on the Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo building, the former offices of the Shell Oil Company. Political prisoners were kept in the attic <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> air raid, so the RAF had to bomb {{the lower levels of}} the building.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} {{first-class}} match in the 193435 season, and his fourth overall, he confirmed his batting ability with 58 and 86 against the South Australian bowling attack led by Clarrie Grimmett, the world's leading leg spinner at the time, {{but was unable}} <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> eight-wicket defeat. Tallon played in five matches for the season, and Queensland lost four and won none. He took four catches, made two stumpings and scored 216 runs at 24.00 in innings, although he did score four ducks.|$|E

He broke through for his first first-class century in three years when he made 169 against New South Wales, {{but it was not}} enough <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> innings defeat. He scored 60 and took a match total of 5/102 in a match for Victoria against the touring South Africans early in the season, but this was not enough for him to regain his Test position. He bowled with steady results throughout the season, never taking more than three wickets in an innings and five in a match.|$|E
