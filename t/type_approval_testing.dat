Basically absorption and mass transport of water into and within the module has to be considered. These phenomena depend on the ambient climate of the PV-module in use, the design (back-sheet, glass-glass, all polymer, e. g.), the operation conditions (rack-mounted, on rooftop, building integrated) and the material composition. We try to evaluate t est conditions that are primarily based on the stresses occurring during the operation at specific locations by using monitored climatic data and applying phenomenological models for the estimation of the moisture load at the surfaces of PV-modules as function of the module temperature. A simple time transformation function was used for the design of appropriate damp-heat tests as accelerated service life tests. The evaluated testing times differ up to an order of magnitude for different climatic locations, depending on the kinetics of the dominant degradation processes...|$|E

40|$|Vehicle type {{approval}} CO 2 emission figures {{form the basis}} for many countries’ national policy to reduce transport's contribution to anthropogenic climate change. However, it has become increasingly apparent that the vehicle <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>testing</b> procedure used in Europe is not fit for purpose. There is, therefore, a need for representative real world emission factors {{that can be used to}} inform consumers, aid policy makers and provide an accurate benchmark from which {{type approval}} figures can be compared. In this work, two methods are explored to assess their feasibility to provide robust CO 2 emission figures. The first is on-road vehicle activity tracking, using data collected from the vehicle controller area network. This method was chosen as it has the potential to provide large quantities of cheap, reliable data and has been demonstrated by recording over 40 parameters during testing of a third-generation Toyota Prius. This data has been used to analyse the vehicle powertrain control and provide a clear understanding of the control mechanisms that balance the engine and electrical power systems, present a comparison of the emissions of conventional and hybrid taxis giving local policy makers the underlying evidence required to introduce strong policies to reduce urban emissions from taxis and build a microscale emission model for accurate and detailed emission forecasts. The second method is microscale vehicle modelling, defined as very short time step models (1 second or less) that capture vehicle and location specific details within the model. The model requires vehicle speed and road gradient data as input and outputs second-by-second cumulative and total fuel consumed and CO 2 emissions. The model has been validated against independent data (chassis dynamometer data collected by Argonne National Laboratory) and is now a powerful tool to help assess the effects of local policies (geofences, changes in the speed limit, incentives for hybrid vehicle uptake) or schemes (eco-driving) on the CO 2 emissions from hybrid vehicles. This work has further developed these two methods in two ways. Firstly, by demonstrating the accuracy of controller area network data collected in vehicle activity tracking. Secondly, by demonstrating the precision of emission models built using real-world data, despite the data noise caused by real world conditions. In conclusion, these methods are well suited to providing representative real world CO 2 emission factors, especially if the methods are combined. This is because vehicle activity tracking can provide the large amount of data needed for vehicle modelling and a vehicle model can provide situation specific emission factors, which, in contrary to many current emissions factors, are not only dependent on vehicle average speeds. ...|$|E

Acquisition campaign Three Honda cars, one conventional (the Civic 2. 0) and two hybrids (the Civic IMA and the Civic Hybrid), equipped to collect emissions as well as the engine and vehicle working parameters were driven three times by twenty drivers on the same urban route. Drivers were asked to drive normally and not requested to do anything special but to scrupulously follow the given itinerary. Results Two main results were obtained: average and maximum emission levels for the three cars are quantified; the effects of the drivers on such levels assessed. The conventional car (with two people and 250 kg of measurement tools onboard) consumes an average of 12. 6 l/ 100 km, its CO 2 emissions range between 200 g/km and 300 g/km with an average of 260 g/km.

This paper deals with the set up of test bench to perform <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>tests</b> on carbody, used for the new Italian double deck coaches. This bench is composed by two longitudinal beams headed by two crossbeams: at one side hydraulic actuators are placed in order to apply the requested load. With a simple procedures is available to perform compression test on bumpers and also compression or traction test on a coupler a worm screw it is possible to apply both traction or compression loads to the carbody. At the other side there is only a reaction crossbeam, rigidly connected with the longitudinal member. Moreover a truss structure should be mounted at one end in order to apply the load at higher levels. The reaction is, however, provided at the other side at bumper level, as stated in the European norm EN 12663. So, this test bench allowed to perform traction and compression tests, at bumpers level or in higher position (window level or roof). The driving/trailer and the trailer double deck coaches tested with this new test bench will compose the 60 new 5 coaches “Vivalto” regional train of Trenitalia developed from October 2005, with the main following characteristics: - Number of seats/places: 90 / 126 - Maximum speed: 160 Km/h The first phase regarded compression tests at bumper level. The European Standard (EN 12663) provide for 2 x 1000 kN symmetric load applied on the head beam of the carbody in the bumper zone and for 2000 kN on the coupler area. Moreover diagonal compression tests are requested: this test is performed applying a force up to 500 kN at one bumper, reacting at the opposite side. The test bench is able, with small adjustments, to provide traction test on the couplers, applying up to 1500 kN, as suggested in the EN 12663 Standard for different types of automatic coupler. In addition, the EN standard provides for compression tests at different height, applying high level loads (up to 400 kN) up to the roof level, by means of an auxiliary truss structure between test bench and carbody. Thusthese compression tests were performed in the third phase: 400 kN 150 mm over the bumpers, 300 kN at window level and 300 kN at the roof level.

Euro 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 differ (beside vehicle preconditioning and warm-up procedures introduced since Euro 3) only because limits for the different pollutants have been progressively lowered. This paper analyses {{through a number of}} experimental tests on spark-ignition cars, a hybrid and a conventional vehicle, the driving conditions responsible for most of the emissions and assesses how such conditions are reproduced by the <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>test.</b> The engine conditions mostly responsible for emissions are: warm-up phase, full loads and transients. Only the warm-up is well covered by the NEDC for vehicles with more than 35 kW/ton power-weight ratio. Tests performed with the Honda Hybrid (the low environmental impact vehicle) and with the Alfa Romeo 147 1. 6 (the conventional vehicle) showed how on the NEDC most emissions are produced in the warm up phase and are of the same order of magnitude for both cars while on more realistic driving cycles (ARTEMIS cycles have been used here) the capacity of the Hybrid to mitigate the transients effects results in a much lower emission rate. Full load conditions are not kept under control by the Hybrid as by the conventional vehicle when the O 2 exhaust sensor is disabled and the air-fuel ratio is no more stoichiometric. Even though this paper has not tested all possible vehicles types, it shows that European <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> procedure has some weaknesses in accounting for the main causes of vehicle emissions. Any new procedure addressing better transients and full load conditions would help the diffusion of low emission vehicles like hybrids more than progressively lowering the allowed emission thresholds on current <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> procedure.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to get data on typical emission levels and patterns of motorcycles and passenger cars currently circulating on the road in Europe. In respect to this, three driving cycles were selected: the current <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> driving cycles used to certify the test vehicles for emissions (NEDC for passenger cars and the EDC for motorcycles) and the world-wide harmonized driving cycle for motorcycles (WMTC). The {{gaseous emissions}} (NOx, HC, CO and CO 2) were measured using the typical <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>test</b> procedure for light duty vehicles. Since all the vehicles tested had been certified using the relevant current legislative cycle (i. e. NEDC or EDC), these vehicles were clearly not optimized for the WMTC cycle. This means that the emissions measured over the WMTC may be considered closer to real world driving emissions allowing a more realistic comparison between the tested passenger cars and motorcycles. In addition to the emission bag-values, the second by second emission concentration values measured at the tailpipe outlet were recorded, allowing the analysis of the emission patterns and in particular of the importance of the cold start in respect to the distance specific emissions. In general, HC and CO emissions from the tested motorcycles resulted to be higher than the respective emission levels of the passenger car, while NOx emissions resulted to be dependent on the engine technology.

In the course of the development of WLTP, the Joint Research Center (JRC) of the European Commission has tested gaseous emissions of twenty-one Euro 4 – 6 gasoline and diesel vehicles, on both the current European <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>test</b> procedure (NEDC) and the progressive versions of the WLTP. The results, which should be regarded just as an initial and qualitative indication of the trends, demonstrated minimal average differences between CO 2 emissions over the NEDC and WLTP. On the other hand, CO 2 emissions measured at JRC on the NEDC were on average 9 % higher than the respective <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> values, therefore suggesting that for the tested vehicles, CO 2 emissions over WLTP were almost 10 % higher than the respective NEDC <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> values. That difference is likely to increase with application of the full WLTP test procedure. Measured THC emissions from most vehicles stayed below the legal emission limits and in general were lower under the WLTP compared to NEDC. Moving from NEDC to WLTP did not have much impact on NOx from gasoline vehicles and CO from diesel vehicles. On the contrary, NOx from diesel vehicles and CO from low-powered gasoline vehicles were significantly higher over the more dynamic WLTP and in several cases exceeded the emission limits.

50|$|HOTA is {{an acronym}} for Home Office <b>Type</b> <b>Approval,</b> a <b>testing</b> and {{certification}} process by the Home Office in the United Kingdom that speed cameras must pass before evidence from them can be admissible in UK courts by way of certification in accordance with Section 20 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 (RTOA) (Amended by the Road Traffic Act 1991). It is a misconception that speed enforcement devices must be Home Office Type Approved before they may be deployed on public roads to gather evidence of speeding offences however if the device does not have UK <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> then the evidence from the device {{is not able to}} be certified but must be adduced by a witness and perhaps an expert witness who is able to adduce evidence of its accuracy. The RTOA route via Section 20 certification is a clear advantage over the unapproved equipment route to court.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{and efficiency of}} Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are key topics to determine the usability and potential of electric vehicles in real-world, and the correct identification of the real-driving conditions is a key aspect to define effective <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> regulation for future vehicles. In this respect several aspects must be addressed, such as the representativeness of different test duty cycles versus real driving, the impact of different environmental conditions {{as well as the}} energy demand of auxiliaries in different operation conditions. In the last years the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission has initiated pre-normative research on hybrid and battery electric vehicles, in order to support policy makers with independent expertise to define better and more representative EU <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>test</b> procedures for electrified vehicles, and harmonise the current reference EU regulation at global level in the framework of the activities of the UNECE. Among the several technical issues tackled, one aspect has involved the design of a test program and the set-up of a customisable, portable and lightweight on-board data logger capable to provide real-time synchronised measurements on the vehicle of all the relevant parameters, in order to accurately determine the fuel and energy {{consumption and}} the overall energy efficiency performance for both hybrid and battery electric vehicles. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present this instrument (i. e. PeMS, Portable energy Measurement System), its modular structure, its potential and its application in a comprehensive test campaign carried out in 2014 on a reference battery electric vehicle. Acquired data from the PeMS are compared with vehicle CANbus data, to assess the accuracy and potential of the instrument. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{critically}} reviews United Kingdom (UK) {{air quality}} policy {{in relation to}} European and Local Air Quality Management (LAQM) responsibilities over the last 20 years. The arguments articulated in this paper highlight the gulf between national and local air quality management in the UK, including differences in legislation, legal responsibilities, scales of operation, monitoring and modelling requirements, exceedence reporting and action planning. It is argued that local authorities cannot {{be held responsible for}} the UK’s failure to achieve the European Union (EU) nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) limit values due to fundamental differences between local government responsibilities under LAQM and the UK compliance assessment reporting to the EU. Furthermore, unambitious and counterproductive national policies and the failure of EU light-duty vehicle <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>tests</b> and Euro standards to reduce real-world nitrous oxide (NOx) emissions are the main reasons for continued NO 2 limit value exceedences. This failure of EU and national air quality policies has effectively undermined local authority action to improve local air quality, resulting in delays in achieving the standards, wasted resources at local and national levels, and, ultimately, unnecessary loss of life and increased morbidity in the UK population. This paper concludes that the current emphasis that the UK government is placing on implementation of Clean Air Zones (CAZs) to achieve the Ambient Air Quality Directive (2008 / 50 /EC) (AAQD), and avoid substantial fines imposed by the European Court of Justice (CJEU), is flawed...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, In-Use Compliance {{testing is}} closely related to {{homologation}} legislation, as in most cases the IUC test is a derivative from the <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>test.</b> As it is the aim of this paper to explore the future of IUC testing, this can be studied best on the basis of expectations for future homologation test procedures that also include vehicles with advanced powertrains. Within the framework of an European project, research has been carried out by TNO Automotive and other research institutes, aimed at the development of adequate measurement methods and test procedures for the evaluation of energy use and emissions of such vehicles. A number of the identified problems that may occur when vehicles with advanced powertrains are tested by current homologation procedures, are discussed in this paper to indicate the nature, size and impact they have on these procedures. Though absolute solutions for these problems are not available at this moment yet, it is already possible to sketch the consequences they will bring for future homologation legislation. Based on these findings, an outlook to the future of IUC testing is drawn. One of the major conclusions concerns {{the fact that it is}} an absolute requirement for test cycles to become representative for real-life conditions, a quality that is absent in most current test cycles. TNO Automotive has gained a lot of experience in this field. Therefore, special attention is given here to their view of how representativity can be ensured best in a test cycle...|$|R
40|$|In the EU Green Paper on Future Noise Policy of 1996 it {{was already}} {{concluded}} that the total effect of EU and Member States legislation on environmental road traffic noise was unsatisfactory until then. This was underpinned by extensive studies in the late nineties in the Netherlands, Germany and other countries. A very recent study in the Netherlands shows {{that in the last}} 30 years passenger cars in real traffic have not actually become quieter, but slightly noisier. Only the noise emission of mainly heavy trucks has decreased at urban speeds. The increase of passenger car noise emission is not in line with the EU objective to reduce road traffic noise, especially in urban areas. An important {{reason for this is that}} the current noise emission <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>test,</b> as described in ISO 362, no longer reflects the real driving behaviour in urban traffic. Therefore the UN-ECE GRB published a new test method in 2007, which is based on a revised ISO 362 standard of the same year. During a period of three years the new method was used for monitoring purposes in parallel with the existing test method, and a database of parallel test results was collected by the EU. This database was used to investigate the qualities of the new method and to quantify the differences between the results of the two methods. Next, several EU policy options for revised noise emission limit values were investigated with an accompanying assessment study on the environmental, social and economical impact of each of the options...|$|R
