5|$|A level-number of 66 is used {{to declare}} a re-grouping of {{previously}} defined items, irrespective of how <b>those</b> <b>items</b> are structured. This data level, also referred to by the associated , is rarely used and, circa 1988, was usually found in old programs. Its ability to ignore the hierarchical and logical structure data meant its use was not recommended and many installations forbade its use.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{studies have}} found that rice rats {{assimilate}} 88% to 95% of the energy in their food. They lose weight when fed on Spartina, fiddler crabs, or sunflower seeds alone, but a diet consisting of several of <b>those</b> <b>items</b> or of mealworms is adequate to maintain weight. In an experiment, marsh rice rats did not show hoarding behavior, but wild rice rats have been observed carrying food to a nest. Even when they live in uplands, they mostly eat water plants and animals, although they consume some upland plants.|$|E

50|$|Apriori is an {{algorithm}} for frequent item set {{mining and}} association rule learning over transactional databases. It proceeds {{by identifying the}} frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as <b>those</b> <b>item</b> sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent item sets determined by Apriori {{can be used to}} determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis.|$|R
50|$|For {{maintainable}} <b>items,</b> <b>those</b> wear-out <b>items</b> {{that are}} determined by logistical analysis to be provisioned for sparing and replacement will assure a longer service life than manufactured items without such planning. A simple example is automotive tires - failure to plan for this wear out item would limit automotive service life {{to the extent of}} a single set of tires.|$|R
5|$|Several {{minerals}} {{used for}} paint pigments were excavated from Chetro Ketl, including charcoal, shale, malachite, iron oxides, hematite, limonite, gypsum, and azurite. Twined sandals, and bones from the ferruginous hawk {{and the great}} horned owl have been found there. The relative lack of exotic material uncovered at Chetro Ketl, such as shells, copper bells, and macaw feathers, may indicate its lesser importance compared to Pueblo Bonito, where <b>those</b> <b>items</b> {{have been found in}} abundance. Because Chetro Ketl has only been partially excavated definitive conclusions remain elusive. In 1937, W. W. Postlethwaite, who had for three seasons directed Hewett's excavation of Chetro Ketl's great kiva, oversaw the final work at the site conducted by the University of New Mexico and the School of American Research.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans {{relied on}} a {{logistical}} system which was very lean and substantially smaller than the United Nations' system. This logistics network was therefore capable of moving far fewer supplies, and this caused considerable difficulty for front-line troops. Based on the efficient Soviet model, this ground-based network relied primarily on railroads to transport supplies to the front while troops transported <b>those</b> <b>items</b> to the individual units on foot, trucks, or carts. This second effort, though more versatile, was also a substantial disadvantage because it was less efficient and often too slow to follow the moving front-line units.|$|E
5|$|After Prussia {{expressed}} an interest in the ship, the Emperor of France, Napoleon III, bought her in April for 2.5 million dollars over the objections of his own navy, which preferred a home-built ship. The exact date of purchase is unknown, but Welles noted in his diary on 7 May that Webb had told him of the sale. On 27 June, Webb refunded the money that had been paid to him and also purchased <b>those</b> <b>items</b> furnished by the government. A little over a week later, he attempted to sail to France, but had to return to port the following day due to engine problems. These were not resolved until 19 July when he, and his entire family, set sail. Dunderberg arrived at Cherbourg on 3 August and the French Navy took possession three days later.|$|E

5|$|The most {{powerful}} of the Wuffingas kings was Rædwald, 'the son of Tytil, whose father was Wuffa', according to the Ecclesiastical History. For a brief period in the early seventh century, whilst Rædwald ruled, East Anglia was among the {{most powerful}} kingdoms in Anglo-Saxon England: Rædwald was described by Bede as the overlord of the kingdoms south of the Humber. In 616, he had been strong enough to defeat and kill the Northumbrian king Æthelfrith at the Battle of the River Idle and enthrone Edwin of Northumbria. He was probably the individual honoured by the sumptuous ship burial at Sutton Hoo. It has been suggested by Blair, on the strength of the parallels between some of the objects found under Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo and those discovered at Vendel in Sweden, that the Wuffingas may have been the descendants of an eastern Swedish royal family. However, as <b>those</b> <b>items</b> previously thought to have come from Sweden are now believed to have been made in England, it seems less likely that the Wuffingas were of Swedish origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{responsibility}} of the North Korean logistics was divided between the Ministry of National Defense (MND), led by Marshal Choe Yong Gun, and the NKPA Rear Service Department, commanded by General Choe Hong Kup. The MND was mainly responsible for railroad transportation and supply procurement, while the Rear Service Department was responsible for road transportation. The North Koreans relied on a logistical system which was very lean and substantially smaller than the United Nations' system. This logistics network was therefore capable of moving far fewer supplies, and this caused considerable difficulty for front line troops. Based on the efficient Soviet model, this ground-based network relied primarily on railroads to transport supplies {{to the front lines}} while troops transported <b>those</b> <b>items</b> onto the individual units on foot, trucks, or carts.

5|$|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, {{the last}} {{original}} novel in the series, begins directly {{after the events}} of the sixth book. Lord Voldemort has completed his ascension to power and gained control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron and Hermione drop out of school so that they can find and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. To ensure their own safety {{as well as that of}} their family and friends, they are forced to isolate themselves. A ghoul pretends to be Ron ill with a contagious disease, Harry and the Dursleys separate, and Hermione wipes her parents' memories. As they search for the Horcruxes, the trio learns details about an ancient prophecy about the Deathly Hallows, three legendary items that when united under one Keeper, would supposedly grant that person to be the Master of Death. Harry discovers his handy Invisibility Cloak to be one of <b>those</b> <b>items,</b> and Voldemort to be searching for another: the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in history. At the end of the book, Harry and his friends learn about Dumbledore's past, as well as Snape's true motives – he had worked on Dumbledore's behalf since the murder of Harry's mother. Eventually, Snape is killed by Voldemort out of paranoia.|$|E

50|$|Taboo-Motivated Lexical Replacement is a cross-linguistic {{phenomenon}} {{that occurs in}} certain languages due to social constraints applied on the speakers. It occurs when the tabooing of lexical items forces individuals to replace <b>those</b> lexical <b>items.</b>|$|R
30|$|Further work is {{required}} in order to confirm the suitability of the questions for younger children; this will be carried out in cognitive debriefing with parents during 2018. Criteria need to be established for the use of these banks in younger children. The calibration of the identified items will be examined to determine whether {{there is a need for}} further item development. The next stage of the project is to compare results across languages and to examine the statistical properties of the items. Focus will be on <b>those</b> <b>item</b> banks with greater than 50 % of items judged to be appropriate for the younger age group.|$|R
25|$|At {{the start}} of the model year, variable-ratio power {{steering}} and power drum brakes were optional equipment. <b>Those</b> <b>items</b> were made standard equipment on all LeSabres (and Wildcats) effective January 1, 1970. Power front disc brakes remained an extra-cost option.|$|E
25|$|Restrictions on Retransfer of USML items {{can also}} cause {{difficulties}} where <b>those</b> <b>items</b> have been incorporated into a product manufactured by a foreign person.

25|$|To cut costs, {{customers}} unload bulkier products directly off a pallet. Some items, like produce, {{are priced}} per item instead of by weight.

25|$|There are two {{stores on}} the museum site, used to house donated objects.

25|$|The {{ease with}} which USML items can be {{exported}} and retransferred using computer networks and removable media significantly {{increases the risk of}} unauthorized retransfer of USML items. As discussed above, carrying a laptop computer which contains USML items overseas is considered a retransfer of <b>those</b> <b>items.</b> Likewise, access to USML items on corporate systems, such as intranets, by foreign persons overseas or in the U.S., is considered a Retransfer of the items.|$|E
25|$|The treaty {{represented}} {{a major breakthrough}} in the Lithuanian Republic's quest for international recognition.
