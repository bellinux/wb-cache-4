5|$|Through {{connections}} that Cohen had with record producer Samuel Charters, the group signed a recording contract with Vanguard Records in December 1966, {{just as the}} label, which had primarily released folk music, was attempting to branch out into the growing psychedelic rock scene. While the band waited to record their debut album, they were present at the Human Be-In, along with other influential San Francisco musical acts, including Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Quicksilver Messenger Service. The event was a prelude to <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love</b> and helped publicize counterculture ideals such as ecology, free-love {{and the use of}} illicit drugs.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, the Bay Area {{and the rest}} of Northern California became the center of the {{counterculture}} movement. Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley and the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood in San Francisco were seen as centers of activity, with the hit American pop song San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair) further enticing like-minded individuals to join the movement in the Bay Area and leading to <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love.</b> In the proceeding decades, the Bay Area would cement itself as a hotbed of New Left activism, student activism, opposition to the Vietnam War and other anti-war movements, the black power movement, and the gay rights movement. At the same time, San Jose {{and the rest of}} the South Bay began to rapidly develop as it began to transition from a largely agricultural-based economy into the hotbed of the high-tech industry. Fred Terman, the director of a top-secret research project at Harvard University during World War II, joined the faculty at Stanford University in order to reshape the university's engineering department. His students, including David Packard and William Hewlett would later help usher in the region's high-tech revolution. In 1955, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory opened for business near Stanford, and although the business venture was a financial failure, it was the first semiconductor company in the Bay Area, and the talent that it attracted to the region eventually led to a high-tech cluster of companies later known as Silicon Valley.|$|E

Allmusic praised the band's ability to recreate a particular aspect of this era, describing the band as [...] "celebrating <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love's</b> soul-chilling autumn: a blasted landscape, post-flower power, resembling Altamont's killing fields, reeking of the Manson Family murders, and, naturally, sounding like a mish-mash {{of all of the}} apocalyptic musical forces that converged upon that era." ...|$|R

25|$|In 1967, {{thousands}} of young people entered the Haight-Ashbury district during {{what became known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love.</b> The San Francisco Sound emerged as an influential force in rock music, with such acts as Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead achieving international prominence. These groups blurred the boundaries between folk, rock and jazz traditions and further developed rock's lyrical content.|$|E

Other acts, like the Millennium, Sagittarius, and the Yellow Balloon were less successful but gained a cult following years later with albums like Begin (Millennium, 1968) and Present Tense (Sagittarius, 1968) highly sought-after on the collectors’ market.|$|E

25|$|Hippie Hill {{has also}} been part of San Francisco’s history, namely <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love,</b> which was a large {{counterculture}} movement that partially took part on the hill. During this Summer of Love, people gathered together to {{connect with one another}} in many ways, mainly dropping acid and playing music together. Music has its own history on the hill, with musicians and bands like Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and George Harrison playing music for free to the public. Improvised drum circles still form on the weekends where people come together and fill the park with a constant beat for hours on end. The hill played a major part in the hippies' ability to openly use drugs because the police had employed a policy of looking the other way {{when it came to the}} hill.|$|E
25|$|The Castro's age {{as a gay}} mecca began {{during the}} late 1960s with <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love</b> in the {{neighboring}} Haight-Ashbury district in 1967. The two neighborhoods are separated by a large mountain, topped by Buena Vista Park. The hippie and free love movements had fostered communal living and free society ideas including housing of large groups of people in hippie communes. Androgyny became popular with men even in full beards as gay hippie men began {{to move into the}} area. The 1967 gathering brought tens of thousands of middle-class youth from all over the United States to the Haight which saw its own exodus when well-organized individuals and collectives started to see the Castro as an oasis from the massive influx. Many of the hippies had no way to support themselves or places to shelter. The Haight became drug ridden and violent, chasing off the gay population, who looked for a more stable area to live.|$|E

500|$|Sgt. Pepper {{is about}} Britain, and <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love</b> was always about America. The only {{song on the}} album that {{approaches}} the ideology and rhetoric of the hippie counterculture was George Harrison's sole contribution, the lush sitar-washed [...] "Within You Without You", and it follows that Harrison was the only Beatle to have visited Haight-Ashbury {{at the peak of}} the scene. Even then, Eastern philosophy informed the lyric more deeply than did acid culture, and it's still a dense and stunning composition no matter its ideology.|$|E

500|$|AllMusic {{contributor}} Tom Maginnis {{writes that}} the lyrics [...] "reflect the idealist optimism of the soon-to-be-labeled 'summer of love' {{and the kind of}} chemically enhanced mind-expanding euphoria that pervaded the new 'hippie' youth culture". Author Ian Inglis views Harrison's mention of [...] "the love that's shining all around here" [...] and [...] "Floating down the stream of time" [...] as especially reflective of the philosophy behind <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love,</b> while theologian Dale Allison identifies the singer's [...] "emerging religious worldview" [...] in the first of those phrases.|$|E
500|$|The band {{recorded}} Harrison's [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] in late May 1967 at De Lane Lea Studios {{in central}} London. Inspired by its author's experimentation {{with the drug}} LSD, and originally running to over eight minutes in length, the song reflects <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love</b> philosophy of 1967 and makes extensive use of guitar feedback. As with the later recorded [...] "All You Need Is Love", the track includes musical and lyrical quotations from other works – in this case, a trumpet passage from Jeremiah Clarke's [...] "Prince of Denmark's March" [...] and a lyric from the Merseys' 1966 hit [...] "Sorrow".|$|E
500|$|The {{transcendental}} {{theme of}} Harrison's lyrics {{aligned with the}} philosophy behind the 1967 Summer of Love – namely, the search for universality and an ego-less existence. Author Ian Inglis considers the line [...] "With our love we could save the world" [...] to be a [...] "cogent reflection" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love</b> ethos, anticipating the utopian message of Harrison's composition [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] and the John Lennon-written [...] "All You Need Is Love". He adds, {{with reference to the}} chorus: [...] "The lyrics are given greater depth by the double meaning of without – 'in the absence of' and 'outside' – each of which is perfectly applicable to the song's sentiments." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love,</b> <b>the</b> events and parties were often held in empty {{warehouses}} and were essentially illegal across the UK.

50|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1960s, some working class skinheads have {{attacked}} hippies. Hippies were also vilified and sometimes attacked by punks, revivalist mods, greasers, football casuals, Teddy Boys and members of other youth cultures in the 1970s and 1980s. Hippie ideals were a marked influence on anarcho-punk and some post-punk youth cultures, such as <b>the</b> Second <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love.</b>|$|R
500|$|After {{three-quarters of}} the city was {{destroyed}} by the 1906 earthquake and fire, San Francisco was quickly rebuilt, hosting the Panama-Pacific International Exposition nine years later. In World War II, San Francisco was a major port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater. It then became the birthplace of the United Nations in 1945. After the war, the confluence of returning servicemen, massive immigration, liberalizing attitudes, along with the rise of the [...] "hippie" [...] counterculture, the Sexual Revolution, the Peace Movement growing from opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, and other factors led to <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love</b> and the gay rights movement, cementing San Francisco as a center of liberal activism in the United States. Politically, the city votes strongly along liberal Democratic Party lines.|$|E
500|$|With the {{worldwide}} {{success of the}} album, [...] "Within You Without You" [...] presented Indian classical music to a new audience in the West {{and contributed to the}} genre's peak in international popularity. It also influenced the philosophical direction of many of Harrison's peers during an era of utopian idealism marked by <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love.</b> The song has traditionally received a varied response from music critics, some of whom find it lacklustre and pretentious, while others admire its musical authenticity and consider the message to be the most meaningful on Sgt. Pepper. Writing for Rolling Stone, David Fricke described the track as being [...] "at once beautiful and severe, a magnetic sermon about materialism and communal responsibility {{in the middle of a}} record devoted to gentle Technicolor anarchy".|$|E
500|$|... "Regal Zone", {{featuring}} saxophone by McKay, also {{covers the}} subject of war and is about the conflict in Iran. [...] "Placebo Effect" [...] addresses the use of placebos in medicine, while [...] "Icon" [...] displays echoes of iconoclasm, with the destruction of paintings featuring religious images, or statues and symbols of old authoritarian regimes. [...] "Premature Burial", [...] "ostensibly inspired" [...] by Edgar Allan Poe's short story of the same name, is the track from which the album title had been taken. It is, in Siouxsie's words, [...] "an expression of claustrophobia, of being hemmed in both by society's and people's limitations". For the writer Mark Paytress, the line [...] "We're all sisters and brothers" [...] looked like a mockery of <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love.</b> The song's conclusion features what sounds like [...] "a formal choir backing for a retreating Red Army in its magnificent defeat".|$|E
50|$|During {{this period}} 1988 - 89, known as <b>the</b> Second <b>Summer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love,</b> Cook was also doing {{editorial}} shots for Deadline magazine, working for Rhythm King Records and designing for William Orbit {{and his new}} label Guerilla Records, for whom he produced a distinctive blue camouflage sleeve influenced by a Thai Air-force shirt that he'd found on his travels in South-East Asia.|$|R
