5|$|Certain {{facilities}} are {{equipped to handle}} TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate <b>treatment</b> <b>center.</b> Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate {{blood flow to the}} brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain herniation. Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes.|$|E

40|$|Objective:To {{estimate}} the cost-effectiveness of anorectal chlamydia screening among {{men who have}} sex with men (MSM) in care at HIV <b>treatment</b> <b>centers.</b> Design:Transmission model combined with economic analysis over a 20 -year period. Setting and participants:MSM in care at HIV <b>treatment</b> <b>centers.</b> Intervention:Once-yearly or twice-yearly screening for anorectal chlamydia among MSM in care at HIV <b>treatment</b> <b>centers.</b> Main outcome measures:Averted HIV and chlamydia infections; discounted quality-adjusted life-years and costs; incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results:Costs will be saved by routine chlamydia screening of MSM in care at HIV <b>treatment</b> <b>centers</b> if these patients seek little or no screening elsewhere. Nonroutine screening is considerably more expensive than routine screening offered within a scheduled visit. Adding once-yearly chlamydia screening for MSM in care at HIV <b>treatment</b> <b>centers</b> is cost saving when 30 % or fewer of those men seek once-yearly screening elsewhere (Euro 1. 5 to Euro 8. 1 million saved). Twice-yearly routine screening at HIV <b>treatment</b> <b>centers</b> is cost-effective only when routine screening takes place without additional nonroutine screening (Euro 1. 9 million saved). Conclusions:Adding annual chlamydia screening to the HIV consultation will be cost saving as long as only a limited proportion of men are nonroutinely screened. The ICER was most sensitive to the percentage of MSM that continue to be screened elsewhere. ...|$|R
