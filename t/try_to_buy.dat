500|$|Famous Players put the Stanley up {{for sale}} in the spring of 1991, with the {{condition}} that it not be used as a movie theatre. In {{the months leading up to}} the Stanley's closure, Famous Players had a conditional sale agreement for the theatre with Vancouver developer Sandy Cox, who was planning to keep the Stanley's facade and convert the interior into retail space. The Vancouver City Council received a proposal to change the building to retail use, which it approved, but the planned development was abandoned, and the building remained vacant for several years. During the early 1990s, a [...] "Save Our Stanley" [...] campaign was begun to preserve the building and prevent commercial redevelopment of the space. In 1994, the Stanley Theatre Society was formed to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the Stanley for the Arts Club Theatre Company, and in 1997 it purchased the theatre from Famous Players for $3,173,000. Renovation costs, including sound and lighting equipment, came to $5.8million, which brought the costs of purchase and renovation to about $9million, $1.5million more than the $7.5million originally budgeted. Money came from fundraising campaigns by the Arts Club and Vancouver TheatreSports, at least $3.9million from the provincial and federal government, a $100,000 grant from the City of Vancouver, the purchase of a density transfer to the One Wall Centre by Peter Wall for $1.2million, as well as corporate sponsorship by du Maurier, who contributed $1.2million—although du Maurier would later withdraw as a sponsor because of federal restrictions on tobacco advertising.|$|E

The suppliers are individuals, who try to sell their labor for the highest price. The demanders of labor are businesses, which <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the type of labor they need at the lowest price. The equilibrium price for a certain type of labor is the wage rate. However, economist Steve Fleetwood revisited the empirical reality of supply and demand curves in labor markets and concluded that the evidence is [...] "at best inconclusive and at worst casts doubt on their existence."

2500|$|Hay {{and straw}} were found {{contaminated}} with cesium [...] from the reactors {{and outside the}} evacuation zone. The news of the contamination of foods with radioactive substances leaking from the Fukushima nuclear reactors damaged the mutual trust between local food producers, including farmers, and consumers. The source of cesium {{was found to be}} rice straw that had been fed to the animals. A notice from the Japanese government that was sent to cattle farmers after the nuclear accident made no mention of the possibility that rice straw could be contaminated with radioactive materials from the fallout. Beef from Fukushima Prefecture was removed from the distribution channels. Health minister Kohei Otsuka stated on 17 July 2011 that this removal might not be sufficient. The urine of all cattle for sale was tested in order to return those cows that showed levels of radioactive substances higher than the government-set limit to farms so they could be decontaminated by feeding them safe hay. The minister said that the government should <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> uncontaminated straw and hay {{in other parts of the}} country and offer this to the farmers in the affected areas. All transport of beef raised in the prefecture Fukushima was [...] prohibited after 19 July. The meat of some 132 cows was sold to at least 36 of the 47 prefectures of Japan. In more and more places contaminated meat was found.|$|E
