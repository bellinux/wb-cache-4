5|$|An {{agreement}} {{exists between}} BAA and West Sussex County Council preventing {{the building of}} a second runway before 2019. Nevertheless, consultations were launched in 2002 by the Department for Transport, at which proposals for additional facilities and runways were considered.

5|$|At 09:45, the US Embassy closed. <b>There</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> {{diplomatic}} {{relations between the}} US and Cambodia again until 11 November 1991. By 10:41 all the evacuees including Ambassador Dean and President Saukham Khoy had been lifted out by helicopters of HMH-462. Helicopters of HMH-463 operating from the USS Hancock then began to land to extract the ground security force.|$|E
5|$|B. Lance Armstrong was {{declared}} winner of seven consecutive Tours from 1999 to 2005.

The Tour director Christian Prudhomme had previously declared that if this happened, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> alternate winners for those years, but this has not yet been made official.|$|E
5|$|During the 2015 Labour {{leadership}} election, Andy Burnham {{said that}} he would introduce a graduate tax to replace fees. He was ultimately unsuccessful in his bid for leadership.

5|$|In 1965, the Museum Society raised $40,000 {{to mount}} the grand portal of the old church. It was {{installed}} in the de Young Museum, the centerpiece of Hearst Court, the main exhibit hall. The rest of the stones were abandoned by the museum in May 1969 with the announcement that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> reconstruction. After this, stones were occasionally taken by park workers and used to decorate Golden Gate Park.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, British prime {{minister}} Gordon Brown {{had a meeting}} with Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and said that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> further talks over the sovereignty of the Falklands. In March 2013, the Falkland Islands held a referendum on its political status, with 99.8 percent of voters favoured remaining under British rule. Argentina does not recognise the Falkland Islands as a partner in negotiations; consequently, it dismissed the Falkland Islands' sovereignty referendum.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010 The Guardian {{published}} {{an open letter}} from several public figures asking the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to proceed with a prosecution or explain its position. In July that year Keir Starmer, director of the CPS, announced that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> prosecution because of the medical disagreement between the three pathologists. Starmer said there was enough evidence for an assault charge, but the six-month deadline for that had expired.|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes it is {{suggested}} that Ellen White herself said that her writings were not necessary for our salvation. This statement may clarify her meaning. [...] "If man had kept the law of God, as given to Adam after his fall, preserved by Noah, and observed by Abraham, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>no</b> necessity for the ordinance of circumcision. And if the descendants of Abraham had kept the covenant, of which circumcision was a sign, they <b>would</b> never have <b>been</b> seduced into idolatry, nor <b>would</b> it have <b>been</b> necessary for them to suffer a life of bondage in Egypt; they would have kept God's law in mind, and <b>there</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>no</b> necessity for it to be proclaimed from Sinai or engraved upon the tables of stone.

5|$|In this context, a {{dependency}} graph is a graph {{that has}} a vertex for each object to be updated, and an edge connecting two objects whenever one of them needs to be updated earlier than the other. A cycle in this graph is called a circular dependency, and is generally not allowed, because <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> way to consistently schedule the tasks involved in the cycle.|$|E
5|$|James Richard Ellis {{has argued}} that the incest taboo is {{fundamental}} to a civilized society. Building on Sigmund Freud's theories and psychoanalysis this is shown in Ovid's version of the myth of Myrrha. When the girl has been gripped by desire, she laments her humanity, for if she and her father were animals, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> bar to their union.|$|E
5|$|Other ideas {{put forward}} and {{discounted}} before the consultation stage included a complete {{restoration of the}} pre-1974 Worcestershire county boundary. This option included Stourbridge and Halesowen, as they were {{under the jurisdiction of}} Worcestershire County Council until 1 April 1974. The LGBCE deemed that this Local Government review did not include metropolitan counties (except a one-off review of Sefton on Merseyside), so <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> change to the boundaries of Dudley Metropolitan Borough.|$|E

5|$|A gallery feature {{was also}} planned and would allow players to unlock bonus {{material}} {{depending on their}} progression in the game. Fan artwork and music would be unlockable through this feature, as well as minigames, including a card game similar to Triple Triad from Final Fantasy VIII. The remake {{was expected to be}} released on the Internet for free and played on console emulators, since <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> cartridge version due to financial constraints. Only a semi-working 3D test was actually completed, and the project was discontinued in mid-2000 due to a number of factors, including the accidental loss of Lazur's data and his desire to improve his programming skills.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S. Lewis is the Argument from Reason: if, as monism implies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, then {{we have no reason}} for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E
5|$|Boycott {{himself said}} {{that he did not want}} such a large number of Ulstermen, as he had saved the grain harvest himself, and that only ten or fifteen labourers were needed to save the root crops. He feared that a large number of Ulstermen would lead to sectarian violence. While local Land League leaders said that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> trouble from them if the aim was simply to harvest the crops, more extreme {{sections}} of the local population did threaten violence against the expedition and the troops.|$|E
