5|$|In {{addition}} to the Plymouth Rock Memorial, several other monuments were constructed in celebration of Plymouth's tricentennial. These include statues of Massasoit and William Bradford, and a sarcophagus containing <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 51 Pilgrims {{who died in the}} winter of 1620, which rests atop Cole's Hill.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} bony plates {{embedded}} in their skin, a trait {{that appears to}} have evolved independently several times. In certain other species, the skin {{at the top of the}} head is compacted and the connective tissue of the dermis is co-ossified with <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull (exostosis).|$|E
5|$|Data for the abelisaurid forelimbs {{are known}} from Eoabelisaurus and the carnotaurines Aucasaurus, Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus. All had small forelimbs {{which seem to}} have been vestigial. <b>The</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forearm (radius and ulna) were {{extremely}} short, only 25% of the length of the upper arm (humerus) in Carnotaurus and 33% in Aucasaurus. The entire arm was held straight, and the elbow joint was immobile.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the cold, the emperor penguin encounters another stressful condition on deep dives—markedly increased pressure of up to 40 {{times that of the}} surface, which in most other terrestrial organisms would cause barotrauma. <b>The</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> penguin are solid rather than air-filled, which eliminates the risk of mechanical barotrauma.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{anatomy of}} group {{is well known}} thanks to the very {{detailed}} work on Eusthenopteron by Erik Jarvik {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. <b>The</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull roof were broadly similar to those of early tetrapods and the teeth had an infolding of the enamel similar to that of labyrinthodonts. The paired fins had a build with bones distinctly homologous to the humerus, ulna, and radius in the fore-fins and to the femur, tibia, and fibula in the pelvic fins.|$|E
5|$|The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in {{all members}} of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen (opening) {{perforates}} the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone). The pelvis and <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hindlimbs are heavily built. The femoral tubercle of the acetabulum (part of the pelvis), which anchors the rectum femoris muscle, is reduced relative to Holochilus and Lundomys.|$|E
50|$|The postfrontal have a {{posterior}} {{process that}} overlaps <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large postorbital, similar to <b>the</b> skulls <b>of</b> other basal ichthyosaurs.|$|R

5000|$|All anatomists agree {{upon that}} <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw {{consists}} of two parts joined together at the chin. … <b>The</b> inspection <b>of</b> this part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corpses convinced me that <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw is all one, with no joint nor suture. I have repeated the observation {{a great number of}} times, in over two hundred heads …I have been assisted by various different people, who have repeated the same examination, both in my absence and under my eyes.

5|$|The forelimb {{bones of}} azhdarchids and ornithocheirids were unusually long {{compared}} to other pterosaurs, and, in azhdarchids, <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arm and hand (metacarpals) were particularly elongated. Furthermore, as a whole, azhdarchid front limbs were proportioned similarly to fast-running ungulate mammals. Their hind limbs, on the other hand, were not built for speed, but they were long compared with most pterosaurs, and allowed for a long stride length. While azhdarchid pterosaurs probably could not run, {{they would have been}} relatively fast and energy efficient.|$|E
5|$|Titanosaurians were {{a flourishing}} group of sauropod dinosaurs during Cretaceous times. The Spanish {{locality}} {{from the latest}} Cretaceous of “Lo Hueco” yielded a relatively well preserved, titanosaurian braincase, which shares a number of unique features with A. atacis from France. However, it appeared to differ from A. atacis in some traits also. The specimen has been provisionally identified as Ampelosaurus sp.; it is most likely a mature titanosaurian since <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> braincase have largely fused together.|$|E
5|$|Forensics teams {{analyzed}} the DNA of Deer Island Jane to exclude some missing persons and {{in hopes of}} matching it to possible relatives of the girl whose DNA was on record. It was obtained through samples of hair and a tooth. The DNA did not match the profiles stored in databases of known missing persons. Officials stated that they also sent samples to the University of North Texas {{to create a more}} specific profile, a time-consuming process. Mitochondrial DNA from <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child was later developed to compare to possible relatives.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of {{scaphoid}} fractures {{is guided}} by <b>the</b> location in <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fracture (proximal, waist, distal), displacement (or instability) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fracture, and patient tolerance for cast immobilization.|$|R
5000|$|Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are {{minimally}} invasive procedures that inject cement into <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> back that is fractured. However, the data examining <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> these procedures is mixed.|$|R
5000|$|The common flexor tendon is a tendon that {{attaches}} to <b>the</b> medial epicondyle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> humerus (lower part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper arm that {{is near the}} elbow joint).|$|R
5|$|Gloucester {{seems to}} have been the main seat of Æthelred's and Æthelflæd's power, and before 900 they founded a new minster there, {{dedicated}} to St Peter. In 909 a West Saxon and Mercian army raided Viking territory and seized <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northumbrian king and martyr, St Oswald, from Bardney in Lincolnshire. The bones were translated to the new Gloucester minster, which was renamed St Oswald's Priory in his honour. Both Æthelred and Æthelflæd were buried there. The historian Martin Ryan sees the new minster as something like a Mercian royal mausoleum, to replace the one at Repton destroyed by the Vikings.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{proximal}} series {{can be directly}} compared to the ulnare and intermedium of tetrapods. The fin was clearly weight bearing, being attached to a massive shoulder with expanded scapular and coracoid elements and attached to the body armor, large muscular scars on the ventral surface of the humerus, and highly mobile distal joints. <b>The</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forefins show large muscle facets, suggesting that the fin was both muscular and {{had the ability to}} flex like a wrist joint. These wrist-like features would have helped anchor the creature to the bottom in fast moving current.|$|E
5|$|Inside the {{lacrimal}} {{bones were}} depressions {{that may have}} held glands, such as salt glands. Within the maxillae were sinuses that were better developed than those of more basal theropods such as Ceratosaurus and Marshosaurus; {{they may have been}} related to the sense of smell, perhaps holding something like Jacobson's organ. The roof of the braincase was thin, perhaps to improve thermoregulation for the brain. The skull and lower jaws had joints that permitted motion within these units. In the lower jaws, <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front and back halves loosely articulated, permitting the jaws to bow outward and increasing the animal's gape. The braincase and frontals may also have had a joint.|$|E
5000|$|Toothache, {{which can}} result in severe pain and loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tooth but is rarely life-threatening, unless over time the {{infection}} spreads into <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaw and starts osteomyelitis.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{forehead}} is <b>the</b> squamous part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frontal <b>bone.</b> <b>The</b> overlying {{muscles are}} the occipitofrontalis, procerus, and corrugator supercilii muscles, {{all of which}} are controlled by <b>the</b> temporal branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> facial nerve.|$|R
50|$|The radial nerve can {{be damaged}} if <b>the</b> humerus (<b>the</b> <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arm) is broken, because it {{runs through the}} radial groove on <b>the</b> lateral border <b>of</b> this <b>bone</b> along with <b>the</b> deep brachial artery.|$|R
5|$|Jackson gave a 90-minute {{interview}} to Oprah Winfrey on February 10, 1993, his second television interview since 1979. He grimaced when speaking {{of his childhood}} abuse {{at the hands of}} his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elephant Man, slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, and stated {{for the first time that}} he had vitiligo. Dangerous re-entered the album chart in the top 10, more than a year after its original release.|$|E
5|$|Planning for dental {{implants}} {{focuses on}} the general health condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can {{increase the risk of}} failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} vertebrae of Apatosaurus {{are less}} elongated and more heavily constructed {{than those of}} Diplodocus, a diplodocid like Apatosaurus, and <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leg are much stockier despite being longer, implying that Apatosaurus was a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. Apatosaurus had a single claw on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb. The Apatosaurus skull, long thought {{to be similar to}} Camarasaurus, is much more similar to that of Diplodocus. Apatosaurus was a generalized browser that likely held its head elevated. To lighten its vertebrae, Apatosaurus had air sacs that made the bones internally full of holes. Like that of other diplodocids, its tail may have been used as a whip to create loud noises.|$|E
5000|$|The Dairy Sentry (an {{irregular}} heptagon) - Originally {{introduced in}} an enchanted form as an inverted capital 'G', the dairy sentry was Triangle and Robert's pet dog {{prior to his}} disenchantment by <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Starham.|$|R
50|$|Avascular {{necrosis}} {{most commonly}} affects <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> long <b>bones</b> such as <b>the</b> femur (<b>the</b> <b>bone</b> extending from <b>the</b> knee joint to the hip joint). Other common sites include <b>the</b> humerus (<b>the</b> <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper arm), knees, shoulders, ankles and the jaw.|$|R
5000|$|Bundle bone is a histologic {{term for}} <b>the</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{alveolar}} process that surrounds teeth and into which <b>the</b> collagen fibers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> periodontal ligament are embedded. [...] It {{can also be}} referred to as alveolar bone proper.|$|R
5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{spends much}} of its time climbing trees, and has adaptations to this lifestyle, {{many of which are}} shared by other woodpecker species. These include the zygodactyl arrangement of the foot, with two toes facing forward and two back, and the stiff tail feathers that are used as a prop against the trunk. In most birds <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tail diminish in size towards its end, but this does not occur in woodpeckers, and the final vertebra, the pygostyle, is very large to anchor the strong tail muscles.|$|E
5|$|The ulnar styloid process (a {{projection}} on the ulna, one of <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forearm, {{where it}} meets the wrist) {{is not as}} hooked as in other lorisids, according to Schwartz, which Groves suggests may indicate that the wrist is more mobile. Another alleged diagnostic feature {{is the presence of}} an entepicondylar foramen (an opening near the distal, or far, end of the bone) on the humerus (upper arm bone); however, Sarmiento found this feature in 4 out of 11 specimens, and on one side of a fifth, and Stump noted that the foramen occurred in specimens from across the potto's range.|$|E
5|$|Unlike semiaquatic temnospondyls, {{terrestrial}} temnospondyls have skulls {{that are}} adapted for biting land-living prey. The sutures between <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull in the dissorophoid Phonerpeton {{are able to}} withstand {{a high degree of}} compression. Compressive forces would have been experienced when biting down on prey. Earlier aquatic tetrapods and tetrapod ancestors differ from temnospondyls like Phonerpeton in that their skulls were also built to withstand tension. This tension would have been experienced during suction feeding underwater. Temnospondyls like Phonerpeton were among the first tetrapods that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting.|$|E
