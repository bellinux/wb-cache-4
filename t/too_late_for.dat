5|$|Arrow Books also {{released}} a novelisation of the 1979 Quatermass serial, written by Kneale. This was written during production, and contained many additional scenes and extra background detail {{not included in}} the original scripts. Kneale offered many of these new scenes to the producers of the television version, but by this stage it was <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> them to be incorporated.|$|E
5|$|Carl Jaenisch {{had arrived}} <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> the tournament; Staunton convincingly won a match with him soon after (seven wins, one draw, and two losses). Later in 1851 Staunton played a match against Elijah Williams, {{who had won}} their {{play-off}} for third place in the London International tournament. Staunton won more games (six wins, three draws, and four losses) but lost the match because he had given Williams a three-game start.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 {{the heirs}} of Venancio Sanchez {{filed a lawsuit}} against James Deering, {{claiming}} an undivided half interest in his Cape Florida property. This brought development of the resort on Cape Florida to a halt. After many legal battles, the suit was finally decided in Deering's favor by the United States Supreme Court in 1926. The decision came <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> Deering; he had died the previous year.|$|E

5|$|Kashyapa married Manasa to sage Jaratkaru, {{who agreed}} to marry her on the {{condition}} that he would leave her if she disobeyed him. Once, when Jaratkaru was awakened by Manasa, he became upset with her because she awakened him <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> worship, and so he deserted her. On the request of the great Hindu gods, Jaratkaru returned to Manasa and she gave birth to Astika, their son.|$|E
5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} {{a book to}} {{the discussion}} of Poniatowski, The Dispute over Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). He notes that the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly colored {{by the fact that}} he was the last king of Poland – the king who failed to save the country. This failure, and his prominent position, made him a convenient scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, but it was <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> that – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E
5|$|Neversoft's Brian Bright {{revealed}} {{that the use of}} Guitar Hero guitar controllers within DJ Hero arose when they tried to create mixes of guitar-heavy and rock tracks in the game; they felt something was missing in these mixes and added in the Guitar Hero-style of play alongside it. Bright has stated that, while <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> the planned release of Guitar Hero 5, they are looking towards future instrument controller interoperability, including use of the DJ Hero controller into gameplay for future Guitar Hero titles, or using drum controllers within DJ Hero.|$|E

5|$|One of Piłsudski's main goals was to {{transform}} the parliamentary system into a presidential system; however, he opposed the introduction of totalitarianism. The adoption of a new Polish constitution in April 1935, tailored by Piłsudski's supporters to his specifications — providing for a strong presidency — came <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> Piłsudski to seek that office; but the April Constitution would serve Poland up to the outbreak of World War II and would carry its Government in Exile {{through to the end}} of the war and beyond.|$|E
5|$|One {{reason for}} the success of the {{offensive}} in this sector was the failure of Falkenhausen to employ a defence in depth. In theory, the enemy would be allowed to make initial gains, thus stretching their lines of communication. Reserves held close to the battlefield would be committed once the initial advance had bogged down, before enemy reinforcements could be brought up. The defenders would thus be able to counter-attack and regain any lost territory. In this sector, Falkenhausen kept his reserve troops too far from the front and they were <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> a useful counter-attack on either 10 or 11 April.|$|E
5|$|Seward {{enjoyed his}} time in Georgia, where he was {{accepted}} as an adult {{for the first time}} in his life. He was treated hospitably, but also witnessed the ill-treatment of slaves. Seward was persuaded to return to New York by his family, and did so in June 1819. As it was <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> him to graduate with his class, he studied law at an attorney's office in Goshen before returning to Union College, securing his degree with highest honors in June 1820.|$|E

5|$|This {{problem is}} not {{exclusive}} to electric vehicles. In 2007 research at the Technical University Munich showed that ordinary vehicles in background noise are often detected <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> safe accident avoidance. The researchers measured the distances of 35 approaching vehicles to a pedestrian in the moment when they just got audible in a stationary background noise. These distances were then compared to the stopping distances of the respective cars and an algorithm was proposed to estimate them based on auditory masking.|$|E

As the party moves to a co-worker's apartment, he ends up getting accidentally locked out. He climbs up a scaffold, {{trying to reach the}} apartment window, and ends up in a young boy's room. The boy asks him to stay and wait for him to fall asleep, but Odd falls asleep first. He oversleeps in the unfamiliar room and arrives <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> the train he was to drive on his final working day. He is left standing on the platform without any fixed points in his life, with nothing but a life of emptiness stretching out before him.|$|E

5|$|In February 1935, Hu Die {{was invited}} to join a Chinese {{delegation}} {{to participate in the}} Moscow International Film Festival in the Soviet Union. She was the only film star in the delegation, which mainly comprised influential men of the industry. She arrived <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> the festival, but received a warm welcome, and her films Twin Sisters and Orchid in a Remote Valley (Konggu Lan) were shown in Moscow and Leningrad. From Moscow she went on to tour Germany, France, England, Switzerland and Italy, receiving significant public attention and VIP treatment from the Europeans, to whom Chinese film stars were novelties. She took many notes and photographs, and published a travelogue after returning to China.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the individualistic Roark, Peter Keating is a conformist who bases his choices on what others want. Introduced to the reader as Roark's classmate in architecture school, Keating does not {{really want to be}} an architect. He loves painting, but his mother steers him toward architecture instead. In this as in all his decisions, Keating does what others expect rather than follow his personal interests. He becomes a social climber, focused on improving his career and social standing using a combination of personal manipulation and conformity to popular styles. He follows a similar path in his private life: He chooses a loveless marriage to Dominique instead of marrying the woman he loveswho lacks Dominique's beauty and social connections. By middle age, Keating's career is in decline and he is unhappy with his path, but it is <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> him to change.|$|E
5|$|Menominees from Green Bay, who had mobilized a {{battalion}} of nearly 300 men, arrived <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> the battle. They were upset at having missed the chance to fight their old enemies, and so on August 10, General Scott sent 100 of them after {{a part of the}} British Band that had escaped. Indian agent Samuel C. Stambaugh, who accompanied them, urged the Menominees not to take any scalps, but Chief Grizzly Bear insisted that such a prohibition could not be enforced. The group tracked down about ten Sauks, only two of whom were warriors. The Menominees killed and scalped the warriors, but spared the women and children.|$|E

5|$|On 29 March 1944, Duke of York and {{the bulk}} of the Home Fleet left Scapa Flow to provide a support force for Convoy JW 58. The ship {{operated}} in the Arctic and as cover for carriers conducting the Goodwood series of air strikes on Tirpitz in mid to late August. In September, when she was overhauled and partially modernized at Liverpool, radar equipment and additional anti-aircraft guns were added. She was then ordered to join the British Pacific Fleet and sailed in company with her sister-ship Anson on 25 April 1945. A problem with the ship's electrical circuitry delayed her while she was at Malta and, as a result, she did not reach Sydney until 29 July, by which time it <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> her to take any meaningful part in hostilities against the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Sargent's break {{came when}} Sir Henry Wood visited De Montfort Hall, Leicester, early in 1921 with the Queen's Hall orchestra. As it was {{customary}} to commission a piece {{from a local}} composer, Wood invited Sargent to write a piece entitled Impression on a Windy Day. Sargent completed the work <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> Wood to {{have enough time to}} learn it, and so Wood called on Sargent to conduct the first performance himself. Wood recognised not only the worth of the piece but also Sargent's talent as a conductor and gave him the chance to make his debut conducting the work at Wood's annual season of promenade concerts, generally known as the Proms, in the Queen's Hall on 11 October of the same year.|$|E
5|$|The outcome has two versions. In {{the first}} version, Nikola Jurišić {{rejected}} the offer to surrender on favourable terms, and the Ottomans retreated. In the second version, {{the city was}} offered terms for a nominal surrender. The only Ottomans who {{would be allowed to}} enter the castle would be a token force who would raise the Ottoman flag. In either case, Suleiman withdrew at the arrival of the August rains, and returned homeward instead of continuing towards Vienna as previously planned. He had been delayed nearly four weeks, and during this time a powerful army had been collected in Vienna, which Suleiman had not the intention to face. According to historian Paolo Giovio, Charles arrived with an imperial army at Vienna on 23 September, <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> fighting the Ottomans since Suleiman already withdrew. By their defense of Kőszeg, Nikola Jurišić and his men had saved Vienna from a siege.|$|E

50|$|Secondly, Jentleson et al. outline that {{reciprocity}} {{involves an}} explicit understanding of linkage between the defending state's carrots and the attacking state's concessions.
