However, despite excellent home form, he could only guide Coventry as high as 8th, missing out on a play-off place by only two league places, though several points adrift of that year's standard.|$|E

5|$|The Crusaders' 2004 {{season began}} with two losses: {{first to the}} Waratahs, then to the Blues. They {{recovered}} to again finish second on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> seven wins.

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are {{more similar to}} each other than the {{elements}} in any other group are to each other. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation. In general, their densities increase when moving down <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>with</b> the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium.|$|E

5|$|A period 1 {{element is}} one of the {{chemical}} elements in the first row (or period) of the periodic table of the chemical elements. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate periodic (recurring) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns. The first period contains fewer elements than any other row in <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>with</b> only two: hydrogen and helium. This situation can be explained by modern theories of atomic structure. In a quantum mechanical description of atomic structure, this period corresponds to the filling of the 1s orbital. Period 1 elements obey the duet rule in that they need two electrons to complete their valence shell. The maximum number of electrons that these elements can accommodate is two, both in the 1s orbital. Therefore, period 1 can have only two elements.|$|E
5|$|As he was {{not playing}} {{regularly}} for Mansfield, Beardsley joined Conference National club Rushden & Diamonds on a one-month loan on 19 January 2007. He made his debut a day later, when starting in Rushden's 2–1 home victory against Stafford Rangers, and scored his first goal in the following match, with a 75th-minute header in a 3–1 home win over Cambridge United. Having helped Rushden move up <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> two goals from three matches, he signed for the club permanently on 31 January 2007 on a one-and-a-half-year contract on a free transfer. He finished 2006–07 with 13 appearances and 2 goals for Rushden, as they finished the season in 12th-place in the Conference National. However, he was released the club in May 2007 following a change in management.|$|E

5|$|For the 2008–09 season, Team Bath {{played at}} the highest level they {{achieved}} in their history. Competing in the Conference South, the club were two promotions away from The Football League. Early in the season Bath were competing for a play-off berth, but failed to maintain their form, eventually finishing 11th in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> 16 wins. Towards the end of the season, the Football Conference notified Team Bath that as they were not a limited company they would be ineligible for further promotions, and would no longer be allowed to compete in the FA Cup; the club opted to resign from the Conference {{at the end of the}} season rather than restructure. Team Bath had at the time been discussing the possibility of a merger with Bath City, with the aim of getting the merged team into the Football League.|$|E
5|$|For {{the scene}} in which Ash is {{revealed}} to be an android, a puppet was created of the character's torso and upper body which was operated from underneath. During a preview screening of the film, this scene caused an usher to faint. In the following scene, Ash's head is placed on a table and re-activated; for portions of this scene, an animatronic head was made using a face cast of the actor, Ian Holm. However, the latex of the head shrank while curing {{and the result was}} not entirely convincing. For the bulk of the scene, Holm knelt under <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> his head coming up through a hole. Milk, caviar, pasta, fiber optics, and glass marbles were combined to form the android's innards.|$|E
5|$|Gannon became {{manager of}} Stockport County, {{now in the}} National League North, {{for the third time}} in his career on 18 January 2016. Gannon started off well, taking the team to the Cheshire Senior Cup final and up to ninth in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> a {{sequence}} of seven games unbeaten, including five victories, in the run up to Easter. County finished eighth in the 2016–17 season, one point outside the play-offs. Gannon was credited with turning around the career of Danny Lloyd, who signed for Peterborough United in May 2017, 12 months after Gannon had persuaded him to play for County rather than quit the game altogether. Gannon said that he was pleased with his defence, but wanted to overhaul the attacking side so as to reach the play-offs the following season.|$|E

They interrogate the Hard Faced Man, but because no one who participated will testify against him, it is unlikely he will be prosecuted. Hsin is brought to the hospital and his daughter is placed on an organ donor list. Chao mysteriously disappears, awakening in a crematorium oven before he is burned alive.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Super 12 {{expanded}} {{to form the}} Super 14 when the Western Force from Perth, Australia, and the Cheetahs from the Free State and Northern Cape Provinces, South Africa joined the competition. An unbeaten run of sixteen matches was nearly halted when the Crusaders drew with the Western Force in Perth in round eleven. The following week, the unbeaten run was ended when the Crusaders lost to the Stormers in Cape Town. That loss was their {{only one of the}} year, as they finished top of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> eleven wins. After beating the Bulls in their semi-final, the Crusaders faced the Hurricanes in the final at Jade Stadium that was played in a thick fog, causing poor visibility. Sections of the crowd could not see the field, and many spectators left during the match. The scorers were tied 9–9 going into the game's last 20 minutes. The Crusaders' Casey Laulala then scored the game's only try before the match finished 19–12.|$|E
5|$|In January 2002, {{chairman}} Doug Ellis {{once again}} appointed Graham Taylor as manager. Villa finished the 200102 season in eighth place, which {{was similar to}} most of their other Premiership finishes. Taylor quit as manager {{for the second time}} {{after the end of the}} 200203 season. Villa had just finished 16th in the Premiership, losing twice to arch rivals Birmingham City. David O'Leary, who had taken Leeds United to the semi-finals of the 200001 Champions League, was brought in as Taylor's replacement. O'Leary took the team to sixth in <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>with</b> a 20 home defeat against Manchester United on the final day meaning that they narrowly missed out on a UEFA Cup place. In 200506, Villa slowly fell down the table and finished in 16th place. The poor placing came despite O'Leary having spent more than £13million the previous summer on players such as Milan Baroš, Kevin Phillips and Wilfred Bouma.|$|E

5|$|The Crusaders {{franchise}} {{was created}} {{as one of}} five New Zealand teams in the Super 12. Originally named the Canterbury Crusaders, the Crusaders' franchise area encompassed the upper South Island of New Zealand (see Super Rugby franchise areas), and was formed from the Buller, Canterbury, Marlborough, Mid-Canterbury, Nelson Bays, South Canterbury, and West Coast rugby unions. The original Crusaders team of 1996 was captained by All Blacks prop Richard Loe and coached by Vance Stewart. The Crusaders struggled in the inaugural season and finished bottom of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> only two wins. Their eight losses included a 49–18 loss to the Blues and a 52–16 loss to the Queensland Reds. And the First ever tour was a pre-visit to South Africa prior start of Super 12.|$|E
