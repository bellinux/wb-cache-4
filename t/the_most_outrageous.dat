25|$|Travis Fickett on IGN gave a {{negative}} review of this episode, claiming 'it misses the mark {{in almost every}} way' and 'plays like <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>outrageous</b> of fan fictions.' He claimed the 2nd Doctor and Doctor-Donna 'stretch credulity so far that it becomes translucent', and that 'it's sort of silly to even bring Rose back when you've got the episode stuffed with almost every other character from the series'.|$|E
25|$|If I were to {{say that}} the {{so-called}} philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>outrageous</b> misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right.|$|E

25|$|After Catiline's death, many of {{the poor}} still {{regarded}} him with respect and did not view him as the traitor and villain that Cicero claimed he was. The aristocratic element of Rome, however, certainly viewed him in a much darker light. Sallust wrote {{an account of the}} conspiracy that epitomized Catiline as representative of all of the evils festering in the declining Roman republic. In his account, Sallust attributes countless crimes and atrocities to Catiline, but even he refuses to heap some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>outrageous</b> claims on him, particularly a ritual that involved drinking blood of a sacrificed child. Later historians such as Florus and Dio Cassius, far removed from the original events, recorded the claims of Sallust and the aforementioned rumors as facts. Up until the modern era Catiline was equated, as Sallust described, to everything depraved and contrary to both the laws of the gods and men.|$|E

500|$|Rowland was {{assigned}} to the Pathfinder Force that marked targets for other aircraft on strategic bombing missions over Europe. Considered an exceptional pilot, he became a master bomber with No.635 Squadron RAF in 1944. As a master bomber, his role was to arrive ahead of the main Allied force, check that flares marking the target were in place, and warn his fellows if they were bombing inaccurately. No.635 Squadron operated Lancasters, a type that, Rowland recalled, [...] "would forgive sprog pilots doing <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>outrageous</b> things to it, and would even bring them home with quite large bits shot off it".|$|E

500|$|Paskin {{also wrote}} that [...] "Peacock" [...] could perhaps be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>outrageous</b> {{example of an}} entirely obvious double entendre. Perry herself has {{considered}} {{it to be the}} biggest innuendo in the world. During an interview with MTV News, the singer said that she is a fan of using puns and double entendres and often looks for ways to incorporate it into her material. In the song, Perry repeatedly asks to see their peacock, if they are [...] "brave enough" [...] to do so. Its composition was compared to Toni Basil's cheerleader anthem [...] "Mickey" [...] by many reviews as both songs are stomping jams, bursting with double meanings.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>outrageous</b> {{accounting}} of Dyer's infant occurred in 1667 when a memorandum of the Englishman Sir Joseph Williamson quoted a Major Scott about the event. Scott was a country lawyer with a notorious reputation, and his detractors included the famous diarist Samuel Pepys. Scott's outlandish assertion {{was that the}} young Massachusetts governor, Henry Vane, fathered the monstrous births of both Mary Dyer and Anne Hutchinson; that he [...] "debauched both, and both were delivered of monsters." [...] After this, the accounts became less frequent, and the last historical account of Dyer's monstrous birth was in 1702 when the New England minister Cotton Mather mentioned it in passing in his Magnalia Christi Americana.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{remained}} unaired {{for so long}} in the United States {{that contemporary}} critics {{did not have an}} opportunity to review it.

500|$|When [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] aired, {{many writers}} in the {{mainstream}} media were still debating the longevity and the overall quality of South Park. With the series still in its earliest stages, the episode continued to shock many due to the characters frequent use of profanities. Nevertheless, several reviewers felt [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] was a significant improvement over [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" [...] and felt that it went in a much more satirical direction. Several media outlets described the fifth episode of the season, [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig", {{as one of the most}} popular early episodes.

500|$|In 1977 he {{starred in}} The Last Remake of Beau Geste and The Hound of the Baskervilles, the latter {{starring}} Peter Cook and Dudley Moore as Holmes and Watson; Terry-Thomas thought that [...] "it was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>outrageous</b> film I ever appeared in... {{there was no}} magic... it was bad!" [...] By then he had exhibited a decrease in bodily movement, a sign of how serious his condition had become. His distinctive voice had developed a softer tone and his posture was contorted. Between 1978 and 1980, he spent much time with medical consultants. Despite this he was offered a few engagements and had been voted the most recognisable Englishman among Americans in a poll which also featured Laurence Olivier, Robert Morley and Wilfrid Hyde-White. As a result, he secured a lucrative advertising contract with the Ford Motor Company. Derek Jarman offered Terry-Thomas a role in his 1979 film The Tempest, but the actor was forced to pull out because of his deteriorating health.|$|E
500|$|In December 1889 it was {{reported}} that the Prince and Princess of Wales were [...] "daily assailed with anonymous letters of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>outrageous</b> character" [...] bearing upon the scandal. The Prince of Wales intervened in the investigation; no clients were ever prosecuted and nothing against Albert Victor was proven. Sir Charles Russell was retained to watch the proceedings in the case on behalf of Albert Victor. Although there is no conclusive evidence for or against his involvement, or that he ever visited a homosexual club or brothel, the rumours and cover-up have led some biographers to speculate that he did visit Cleveland Street, and that he was [...] "possibly bisexual, probably homosexual". This is contested by other commentators, one of whom refers to him as [...] "ardently heterosexual" [...] and his involvement in the rumours as [...] "somewhat unfair". The historian H.

25|$|Every death {{sentence}} involves first an eligibility determination {{and then a}} selection of an eligible defendant {{for the death penalty}}.

500|$|Blaxploitation was {{the first}} {{exploitation}} genre in which the major studios were central. Indeed, the United Artists release Cotton Comes to Harlem (1970), directed by Ossie Davis, {{is seen as the}} first significant film of the type. But the movie that truly ignited the blaxploitation phenomenon was completely independent: Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song (1971) is also perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>outrageous</b> example of the form: wildly experimental, borderline pornographic, and essentially a manifesto for a black American revolution. Melvin Van Peebles wrote, co-produced, directed, starred in, edited, and composed the music for the film, which was completed with a loan from Bill Cosby. Its distributor was small Cinemation Industries, then best known for releasing dubbed versions of the Italian Mondo Cane [...] "shockumentaries" [...] and the Swedish skin flick Fanny Hill, as well as for its one in-house production, The Man from O.R.G.Y. (1970). These sorts of films played in the [...] "grindhouses" [...] of the day—many of them not outright porno theaters, but rather venues for all manner of exploitation cinema. The days of six quickies for a nickel were gone, but a continuity of spirit was evident.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} film critics. LaRue Cook of Entertainment Weekly graded the film with a [...] "D" [...] and wrote, [...] "what {{was once a}} fresh slice of teen comedy has become a slab of stale crudeness." [...] Scott Weinberg of Moviefone, in his negative review, found the film [...] "slightly more amusing to sit through than the two previous entries", in particular praising the Star Trek sexual roleplay scene as [...] "extremely effective." [...] DVD Talk's Jeffrey Robinson writes that [...] "if anything, it will bore you and leave you wondering why you wasted {{an hour and a}} half of your life." [...] Writing in JoBlo.com, Adam Quigley poked fun at the film's themes, declaring that [...] "if there's a lesson to be taken from these films, it's that women are objects, and should always be treated as such." [...] IGNs Hock Teh gave the film 5/10, writing that it [...] "stays very close to the American Pie formula," [...] while criticizing the story as [...] "devoid of anything remotely semi-compelling or even noteworthy." [...] Peter Hammond of Maxim describes American Pie Presents: Beta House as [...] "loaded with sex, laughs and raunchy fun," [...] writing that it [...] "may be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>outrageous</b> slice of pie yet!" ...|$|E
500|$|Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{gave the}} film a four-out-of-five rating {{and called it}} a madcap comedy which dared to [...] "push the {{envelope}} in its own way": [...] "Dostana is a winner all the way. In terms of content, it might just {{prove to be a}} trendsetter." [...] The Times of India also rated it four out of five: [...] "It introduces <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>outrageous</b> scenes in popular Hindi cinema and manages {{to get away with it}} because it's all done with an infectious zest and effervescence that keeps the ribs tickling." [...] Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph rated the film 7.2 out of 10, writing that Dostana [...] "can make you laugh out loud and also strike an emotional chord." [...] Raam Tarat of Future Movies rated the film 3.5 out of 5, praising its performances ("The lead actors share a great chemistry, are easy on the eye and oh so charming that they, along with beautiful Miami make for a visual treat") and calling it [...] "a great, fun entertainer with lots of charm and great music." [...] For Hindustan Times, film critic Khalid Mohamed gave Dostana a three-out-of-five rating: [...] "Good taste, pop colour Miami locations, high-end costumes, make-up styling and the A-grade Dharma Productions values add up to a zingy entertainer".|$|E
5000|$|Plague! was {{generally}} well received with the British Theatre Guide calling it [...] "an astoundingly good production" [...] and What's On Stage calling it [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> ridiculous, <b>outrageous,</b> over <b>the</b> top and watchable pieces of musical theatre {{in a long}} time".

50|$|The film itself {{consists}} {{of interviews with}} various comedians and actors, usually in candid settings. The interviewees engage both in telling their own versions of the joke, and in reminiscing about their experiences with it, the joke's place in comedy history, and even dissecting the logic behind the joke's appeal. A key aspect of the Aristocrats joke {{is that it was}} never told to audiences as part of the comedian's stand-up routine. Instead, it was an inside joke among comedians themselves, who used it as a tool to challenge each other as to who could tell <b>the</b> funniest and <b>most</b> <b>outrageous</b> rendition.|$|R
