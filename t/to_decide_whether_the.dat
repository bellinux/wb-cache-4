5|$|After {{the family}} obtains the CCOD, they usually engage a funeral {{director}} (also {{known as an}} undertaker) who collects the body, embalms it if necessary, and delivers it to the wake. In addition, they have <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> body is to be cremated or buried, and register the death. The funeral director also helps to make arrangements for the wake and funeral, according to the religious beliefs and wishes of the family.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, in Fong Thin Choo, the High Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} under regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, the fact that goods had not been exported from Singapore was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require {{the owner of the}} goods to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> customs officer's decision was justified by the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on which he could reasonably have reached his decision. However, the Court did not pursue the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.|$|E
5|$|Mitoxantrone therapy may be {{associated}} with immunosuppressive effects and liver damage; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related cardiac toxicity. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an echocardiogram and a complete blood count before treatment <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, infection or liver dysfunction during therapy.|$|E

5|$|Schiavo {{describes}} how the FAA uses a formula ascribing specific monetary value to human lives, and how the agency allows numbers <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> cost of extra safety is worth the additional expense. For example, if equipping an airline fleet with smoke detectors would cost $100 million, but would only save 10 lives each worth $1 million, then the expense is ruled out. Schiavo is similarly critical of the internal FAA politics and the FAA's administrators.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} what portion of the statute the Court upholds since it {{expressly}} refuses <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> dues prohibition and fund administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not impose sanctions on the union itself, it {{is not clear}} that anything in § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E

500|$|Delivering the {{judgment}} of the Court, Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin held that the scope of judicial review depends on whether a precedent fact is involved. If the discretion falls outside the precedent fact category, the scope of judicial review is limited to the normal judicial review principles of illegality, irrationality (that is, Wednesbury unreasonableness) and procedural impropriety. On the other hand, if one or more precedent facts are involved, the scope of judicial review [...] "extends <b>to</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> evidence justifies the decision".

5|$|The Polish {{mathematician}} Stanislaw Ulam, {{his wife}} Francoise Ulam, who performed the calculations, and their collaborator, Cornelius Everett, {{worked on the}} Super design through 1949. There was no push from the military for the weapon, because the AEC regarded it as too secret to inform either its own Military Liaison Committee or the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project about it. In September 1949, the Soviet Union detonated a nuclear device. It fell to Oppenheimer, {{as chairman of the}} AEC General Advisory Committee (GAC), <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> United States should develop the Super in response. The Super design used large quantities of tritium, which could only be manufactured in a reactor, and therefore at the expense of plutonium production for smaller weapons, so the GAC advised against it. Nonetheless, Truman approved the Super on January 31, 1950. Because of the secrecy surrounding the decision, accounts published in the 1950s incorrectly portrayed Oppenheimer as obstructing its development on political grounds, and this was a factor in the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954.|$|E

25|$|The High Court's {{decision}} in Teo Soh Lung remains the authority {{on whether the}} basic features doctrine applies in Singapore law, because when the decision was appealed the Court of Appeal held it was unnecessary for it <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> power of Parliament to amend the Constitution can ever be limited.

25|$|Further, Justice Chan, {{relying on}} the English case of Khera v. Secretary of State for the Home Department; Khawaja v.

25|$|Justice Butler {{believed}} {{that in this}} case, the Court was not called upon <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> display of the flag constituted constitutionally-protected speech, nor to decide whether such speech was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, nor whether the real or imagined anarchy that could follow a successful opposition to organized government creates a sufficiently compelling reason to prohibit such activities. It appears (though he does not specify it in his dissent) that he viewed the matter as that of procedural challenges, rather than a case of broad protections of freedom of speech.|$|E

Nick Dreystadt, mechanic and national head of Cadillac service, urged a committee – set up <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Cadillac brand would live on – to revoke that policy. After the policy was eliminated, brand sales increased by 70% in 1934 – and Dreystadt was promoted to lead the entire Cadillac Division.|$|E

The apparent advantage of this approach was that the rule was easy to apply with certain and predictable outcomes. Unfortunately, it was also open to abuse, e.g. the place could be selected fraudulently to validate an otherwise invalid contract; it might lead to the application of laws with no real connection with the transaction itself, say, because the parties signed the agreement while on holiday; or it might have been difficult to decide where the contract was made, e.g. because it was negotiated and signed on a railway journey through several states.|$|E

In this paper we present a quantum information-theoretic proof of the relation between the two problems that is asymptotic in one direction. This result has previously been obtained by Klyachko using geometric invariant theory. The work presented in this paper does not, however, touch upon the non-asymptotic equivalence between the two problems, a result that rests on the recently proven saturation conjecture for GL(d).
