50|$|Auto-defrost, {{automatic}} defrost or self-defrosting {{is a technique}} which regularly defrosts the evaporator in a <b>refrigerator</b> <b>or</b> freezer. Appliances using this technique are often called frost free, frostless or no-frost.|$|R
50|$|Energy Efficiency: Using {{less power}} {{to perform the}} same tasks. This {{involves}} a permanent reduction of demand by using more efficient load-intensive appliances such as water heaters, <b>refrigerators,</b> <b>or</b> washing machines.|$|R
50|$|In NDR systems, {{the initial}} heat sink must sit {{at very low}} {{temperatures}} (10-100 mK). This precooling is often provided by the mixing chamber of a dilution <b>refrigerator</b> <b>or</b> a paramagnetic salt.|$|R
50|$|Examples of {{background}} noises are environmental noises such as waves, traffic noise, alarms, people talking, bioacoustic noise from animals or birds and mechanical noise from {{devices such as}} <b>refrigerators</b> <b>or</b> air conditioning, power supplies or motors.|$|R
50|$|Isolated {{from urban}} societies, Luboml was a quaint blend of {{emerging}} technology and old fashioned practices. Most citizens lived without <b>refrigerators</b> <b>or</b> running water. “We {{always had a}} cow and a garden in front,” one survivor reflects.|$|R
5000|$|Other uses of an {{absorption}} <b>refrigerator</b> (<b>or</b> [...] "chiller") include large systems used {{in office}} buildings or complexes such as hospitals and universities. These large systems {{are used to}} chill a brine solution that is circulated through the building.|$|R

50|$|Absorption <b>refrigerators</b> <b>or</b> thermo-electric Peltier {{units are}} used where quiet running is required; Peltier coolers {{are used in}} the {{smallest}} refrigerators as they have no bulky mechanism. These units are the only option for dwellings lacking electricity, such as farms or rural cabins.|$|R
5000|$|Super Yoke - Apparatus {{composed}} of a crossbar and two uprights. The uprights each have a heavy weight attached to them, such as a <b>refrigerator</b> <b>or</b> diesel engine, and the competitors must carry the yoke on their shoulders for a short distance.|$|R
50|$|Kerrygold irish Cream Liqueurs {{shelf life}} is 2 years, {{stored in a}} <b>refrigerator</b> <b>or</b> not, but should be {{consumed}} within 6 months of opening. The product should be stored away from direct sunlight at temperatures between 0 and 25 °C (32 and 77 °F).|$|R
50|$|According to the Immunization Action Coalition, all {{vaccines}} {{should be}} stored in a <b>refrigerator</b> <b>or</b> freezer that is designed specifically for the storage of biologics or, alternatively, in a separate dedicated unit. A dorm-style combination refrigerator-freezer unit with just one exterior door {{has been shown to}} be unacceptable no matter where the vaccine was placed inside the unit. Stand-alone <b>refrigerator</b> <b>or</b> freezer units are best for storage needs. With retail pharmacies now playing a major role in pneumonia, influenza and shingles immunization programs, the value of critical vaccines being stored in pharmacy refrigerators has reached a new high. In fact, it is not uncommon for many pharmacies to now have over $100,000 of product in a single refrigerator during peak seasons.|$|R

5000|$|Freezer {{units are}} used in {{households}} and in industry and commerce. Food stored at or below [...] is safe indefinitely. Most household freezers maintain temperatures from -23 to -18 C, although some freezer-only units can achieve [...] and lower. Refrigerators generally do not achieve lower than , since the same coolant loop serves both compartments: Lowering the freezer compartment temperature excessively causes difficulties in maintaining above-freezing temperature in the refrigerator compartment. Domestic freezers can be included as a separate compartment in a <b>refrigerator,</b> <b>or</b> can be a separate appliance. Domestic freezers are generally upright units resembling <b>refrigerators</b> <b>or</b> chests (upright units laid on their backs). Many modern upright freezers come with an ice dispenser built into their door. Some upscale models include thermostat displays and controls, and sometimes flatscreen televisions as well.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} the use of {{negative}} feedback control is the ballcock control of water level (see diagram). In modern engineering, negative feedback loops are found in fuel injection systems and carburettors. Similar control mechanisms are used in heating and cooling systems, such as those involving air conditioners, <b>refrigerators,</b> <b>or</b> freezers.|$|R
50|$|In modern homes, butler's pantries {{are usually}} located in {{transitional}} spaces between kitchens and dining rooms, {{and used as}} staging areas for serving meals.

40|$|Unintentional {{deaths from}} {{suffocation}} and strangulation {{account for about}} 20 percent of all nontransport-related infant and child fatalities in the United States. In the late 1950 s, some preventive countermeasures were introduced {{to reduce the number}} of deaths resulting from <b>refrigerator</b> <b>or</b> freezer entrapment. A few years later, countermeasures were introduced to prevent deaths resulting from suffocation by plastic bags, inhumation, and mechanical strangulation from wedging in infant cribs. For three of these major causes of suffocation and strangulation deaths among infants and children (<b>refrigerator</b> <b>or</b> freezer entrapment, suffocation by plastic bag, and inhumation at construction sites), there appears to have been a significant decline in incidence; however, there is no evidence of a significant reduction in deaths from mechanical strangulation in cribs. The impact of current countermeasures is discussed, and some suggestions for new or modified approaches are made...|$|R

50|$|Samsung home appliances, such as <b>refrigerators</b> <b>or</b> air conditioners, have {{a silver}} nano coating on their inner {{surfaces}} for an overall anti-bacterial and anti-fungal effect. As air circulates, the coated surfaces {{contact with the}} silver ions which can resist any airborne bacteria, which in turn suppress the respiration of bacteria, adversely affects bacteria's cellular metabolism and inhibits cell growth.|$|R
50|$|The {{technology}} {{is similar to}} a <b>refrigerator</b> <b>or</b> freezer or air conditioning unit: the different effect is due to the physical location of the different system components. Just as the pipes {{on the back of a}} refrigerator become warm as the interior cools, so an ASHP warms the inside of a building whilst cooling the outside air.|$|R
50|$|The {{roads and}} {{buildings}} are in bad shape.Not {{all the houses}} are equipped with electricity.Even if there is electricity then the <b>refrigerator,</b> <b>or</b> the television cannot be turned on because the family income is much too low.There are daily power cuts of 1 to 3 hours duration; frequently between 19:00 and 23:00, possibly also during noon.|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{rotating}} seal will create heat from friction, this heat {{will need to}} be removed from the seal chamber or else the seal will overheat and fail. Typically, a small tube connected to either the suction or the discharge of the pump will help circulate the liquid. Other features such as filters <b>or</b> <b>coolers</b> will be added to this tubing arrangement depending on the properties of the fluid, and its pressure and temperature. Each arrangement has a number associated with it, as defined by American Petroleum Institute [...] "API" [...] specifications 610 and 682.|$|R
