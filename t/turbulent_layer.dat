This finite volume algorithm was developed using a dual time stepping approach with a preconditioning technique and a new factorization implementation. The method takes the advantage of pressure based and density-based methods. Thus, it provides {{an efficient way to}} numerically solve the Navier-Stokes equations at the low Mach numbers. Meanwhile, to generate the inflow conditions for the simulation of <b>turbulent</b> boundary <b>layers,</b> a dynamic recycling method was proposed.

50|$|The flow over a body {{may begin}} as laminar. As a fluid flows over a surface shear {{stresses}} within the fluid slow additional fluid particles causing the boundary layer {{to grow in}} thickness.

Turbulent flow has a fluctuating and irregular pattern of flow which are made obvious by the formation of vortices. While the <b>turbulent</b> <b>layer</b> grows, the laminar layer thickness decreases. This results in a thinner laminar boundary layer which, relative to laminar flow, depreciates the magnitude of friction force as fluid flows over the object.|$|E

This phenomenon was discovered by an international team led by scientists at the California Institute of Technology and including scientists from Australia, Germany and China. The detection of molecular hydrogen from the collision was initially unexpected because the hydrogen molecule is very fragile and is easily destroyed in shock waves of the kind expected in Stephan's Quintet. However, one solution is that when a shock front moves through a cloudy medium like the center of the group, millions of smaller shocks are produced in a <b>turbulent</b> <b>layer,</b> and this can allow molecular hydrogen to survive.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of a geostrophically balanced horizontal density gradient on turbulent convection in the ocean is examined using numerical simulations and a theoretical scaling analysis. Starting with uniform horizontal and vertical buoyancy gradients, convection is driven by imposing a heat loss or a destabilizing wind stress at the upper boundary, and a <b>turbulent</b> <b>layer</b> soon develops. For weak lateral fronts, turbulent convection results in a nearly homogeneous mixed layer (ML) whose depth grows in time. For strong fronts, a <b>turbulent</b> <b>layer</b> develops, but this layer is not an ML in the traditional sense because it is characterized by persistent horizontal and vertical gradients in density. The <b>turbulent</b> <b>layer</b> is, however, nearly homogeneous in potential vorticity (PV), with a value near zero. Using the PV budget, a scaling for the depth of the turbulent low PV layer and its time dependence is derived that compares well with numerical simulations. Two dynamical regimes are identified. In a convective layer near the surface, turbulence is generated by the buoyancy loss at the surface; below this layer, turbulence is generated by a symmetric instability of the lateral density gradient. This work extends classical scalings for the depth of turbulent boundary layers to account for the ubiquitous presence of lateral density gradients in the ocean. The new results indicate that a lateral density gradient, in addition to the surface forcing, can affect the stratification and the rate of growth of the surface boundary layer...|$|E

40|$|Low-level jets (LLJ) are {{important}} for turbulence in the stably stratified atmospheric boundary layer, but their occurrence, properties, and generation mechanisms in the Arctic are not well known. We analysed LLJs over the central Arctic Ocean in spring and summer 2007 on the bases of data collected in the drifting ice station Tara. Instead of traditional radiosonde soundings, data from tethersonde soundings with a high vertical resolution were used. The Tara results showed a lower occurrence of LLJs (46 %) than many previous studies over polar sea ice. Strong jet core winds contributed to growth of the <b>turbulent</b> <b>layer.</b> Complex relationship between the jet core height and the temperature inversion top height were detected: substantial correlation (r = 0. 72; p < 0. 01) occurred when the jet core was above the <b>turbulent</b> <b>layer,</b> but inside the <b>turbulent</b> <b>layer</b> there was no correlation. The most important forcing mechanism for LLJs was baroclinicity, which was responsible for generation of strong and warm LLJs, which on average occurred at lower altitudes than other jets. Baroclinic jets were mostly associated to transient cyclones instead of the climatological air temperature gradients. Besides baroclinicity, cases related to inertial oscillations, gusts, and fronts were detected. In approximately 50 % of the observed LLJs the generation mechanism remained unclear, but {{in most of these}} cases the wind speed was strong in the whole vertical profile, the jet core representing only a weak maximum.

The more efficient mixing which occurs in a <b>turbulent</b> boundary <b>layer</b> transports kinetic energy {{from the edge of the}} boundary layer to the low momentum flow at the solid surface, often preventing the separation which would occur for a laminar boundary layer under the same conditions.
