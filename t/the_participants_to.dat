5|$|This year, {{the first}} ever EA Sports Jersey Creator Contest was held to design the jerseys for both the rookie and the sophomore team. The contest called for <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>to</b> {{come up with a}} computer-generated jersey design that would replace the {{individual}} team jerseys worn by the players during the Rookie Challenge. Of 12,000 participants, 18-year-old Tim Ahmed, a freshman at Baruch College, won the contest. Ahmed won a free trip to Phoenix and a chance to meet players. This marks {{the first time that a}} fan-designed uniform has ever been worn during an NBA game or NBA event. The Sophomores wore fan-designed white jerseys and the Rookies wore fan-designed purple jerseys in the game.|$|E
25|$|The TUC {{feared that}} an all-out general strike would bring revolutionary {{elements}} {{to the fore}} and limited <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>to</b> railwaymen, transport workers, printers, dockers, ironworkers and steelworkers, as they were regarded as pivotal in the dispute.|$|E

25|$|Jordal {{was one of}} five venues {{used for}} ice hockey at the 1952 Winter Olympics, along with Dælenenga, Marienlyst, Lillestrøm and Kadettangen. Of 37 matches, 23 were played at Jordal between 15 and 25 February. They were {{organized}} as a round-robin tournament with nine participating teams. It doubled as an Ice Hockey World Championships and a European Ice Hockey Championship. The tournament was won by the Edmonton Mercurys, which represented Canada. The figure skating training was originally planned at Jordal Amfi, but was instead moved to Jordal Stadion, to allow <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>to</b> train on natural rather than artificial ice.|$|E

25|$|Concerts {{and variety}} shows are {{commonly}} {{held at the}} PLM Grandstand and Open Field {{as well as in}} the Justo Albert Auditorium. In the middle of 2008, the university grounds became a music hall and camp for <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>to</b> the Opusfest, the international piano and chamber music festival. Master classes with interactive performances conducted by international concert artists were open to the PLM community. Before the end of 2009, PLM was one of the two Philippine educational institutions that participated in the 36th Ship for Southeast Asian Youth Program (SSYEAP), a Japanese government-funded cultural exchange program that promotes friendship and mutual understanding among young people from Southeast Asian nations and Japan.|$|E
25|$|In post-colonial Latin America, pre-Columbian traditions {{merged with}} Christian rituals, and syncretic masquerades and ceremonies, such as All Souls/Day of the Dead developed, despite {{efforts of the}} Church to stamp out the {{indigenous}} traditions. Masks remain an important feature of popular carnivals and religious dances, such as The Dance of the Moors and Christians. Mexico, in particular, retains {{a great deal of}} creativity in the production of masks, encouraged by collectors. Wrestling matches, where it is common for <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>to</b> wear masks, are very popular, and many of the wrestlers can be considered folk heroes. For instance, the popular wrestler El Santo continued wearing his mask after retirement, revealed his face briefly only in old age, and was buried wearing his silver mask.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{successful}} expansion of the domestic partnership act, Assemblymembers Carole Migden and Robert Hertzberg, joined by state Senator Sheila Kuehl, introduced a bill that added 18 new rights to the domestic partnership scheme. It also relaxed the requirements for opposite-sex couples, requiring only one of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>to</b> be over 62 years of age. The expanded rights included standing to sue (for emotional distress or wrongful death), stepparent adoption, a variety of conservatorship rights, {{the right to make}} health care decisions for an incapacitated partner, certain rights regarding distribution of a deceased partner’s estate, limited taxpayer rights, sick leave to care for partners, and unemployment and disability insurance benefits. Governor Gray Davis signed the bill into law on October 22, 2001.|$|E

25|$|Woodall and Constantine {{then take}} the couple {{shopping}} separately to find fashionable and suitable clothing for them which enhances their appearances, to give them more confidence and ultimately help to strengthen their relationship. It is custom for Woodall to take the woman shopping and Constantine to take the man shopping, and enough clothing is bought to arrange and put together twenty-five to thirty different outfits. During the shopping process, Trinny and Susannah use <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>to</b> illustrate which types of clothing are suitable for certain body shapes. The fashion experts sometimes take {{a member of the}} partnership to shops such as Ann Summers, in order to find accessories to liven up their sex lives. The participants are then given a full makeover by Richard Ward, complete with a new hair cut. Their transformed appearances are then revealed to each other at a select location.|$|E
25|$|The {{bystander}} {{effect was}} first {{demonstrated in the}} laboratory by John M. Darley and Bibb Latané in 1968 after they {{became interested in the}} topic following the murder of Kitty Genovese in 1964. These researchers launched a series of experiments that resulted in one of the strongest and most replicable effects in social psychology. In a typical experiment, the participant is either alone or among a group of other participants or confederates. An emergency situation is staged and researchers measure how long it takes <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>to</b> intervene, if they intervene. These experiments have found that the presence of others inhibits helping, often by a large margin. For example, Bibb Latané and Judith Rodin (1969) staged an experiment around a woman in distress. 70 percent of the people alone called out or went to help the woman after they believed she had fallen and was hurt, but when there were other people in the room only 40 percent offered help.|$|E

30|$|Participants {{completed}} seven {{tasks that}} were classified {{into one of}} three security levels: Low, Medium and High based on the general level of privacy or sensitivity a particular task warranted.

The transparent authentication mechanism needs to have that level of confidence that <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> is indeed <b>the</b> authorized device owner. Since the experiment does not last long enough for <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>to</b> build up a device confidence of sufficient level, the device confidence was initially set <b>to</b> “Low” and <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> was instructed <b>to</b> assume that it was based on previous interaction with the device.|$|R

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the meeting Heydrich gave Eichmann firm instructions about what was to appear in the minutes. They were not to be verbatim: Eichmann ensured that nothing too explicit appeared in them. He said at his trial: [...] "How shall I put it — certain over-plain talk and jargon expressions had to be rendered into office language by me". Eichmann condensed his records into a document outlining the purpose of the meeting and the intentions of the regime moving forward. He stated at his trial that it was personally edited by Heydrich, and thus reflected the message he intended <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>to</b> take away from the meeting. Copies of the minutes (known from the German word for [...] "minutes" [...] as the [...] "Wannsee Protocol") were sent by Eichmann to all the participants after the meeting. Most of these copies were destroyed {{at the end of the}} war as participants and other officials sought to cover their tracks. It was not until 1947 that Luther's copy (number 16 out of 30 copies prepared) was found by Robert Kempner, a U.S. prosecutor in the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, in files that had been seized from the German Foreign Office.|$|E
