5|$|Though it {{was known}} {{in the nineteenth century}} that {{bacteria}} are the cause of many diseases, no effective antibacterial treatments were available. In 1910, Paul Ehrlich developed the first antibiotic, by changing dyes that selectively stained Treponema pallidum—the spirochaete that causes syphilis—into compounds that selectively killed the pathogen. Ehrlich had been awarded a 1908 Nobel Prize for his work on immunology, and pioneered the use of stains <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>and</b> identify bacteria, with his work being the basis of the Gram stain and the Ziehl–Neelsen stain.|$|E
5|$|Although minute {{quantities}} of some transuranic elements occur naturally, {{they were all}} first discovered in laboratories. Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly, {{the first of these}} being neptunium, synthesized in 1939. Because many of the transuranic elements are highly unstable and decay quickly, they are challenging <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>and</b> characterize when produced. There have been controversies concerning the acceptance of competing discovery claims for some elements, requiring independent review to determine which party has priority, and hence naming rights. In 2010, a joint Russia–US collaboration at Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, claimed to have synthesized six atoms of tennessine (element 117), making it the most recently claimed discovery. It, along with nihonium (element 113), moscovium (element 115), and oganesson (element 118), are the four most recently named elements, whose names all became official on 28 November 2016.|$|E
5|$|Among the Romani people, mullo (literally {{one who is}} dead) are {{believed}} to return from the dead and cause malicious acts as well as drink human blood, most often that of a relative or {{the person who had}} caused their death. Other potential victims were those who did not properly observe the burial ceremonies or kept the deceased's possessions instead of properly destroying them. Female vampires could return, lead a normal life and even marry but would eventually exhaust the husband with their sexual appetite. Similar to other European beliefs, male vampires could father children, known as dhampirs, who could be hired <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>and</b> get rid of vampires.|$|E

5|$|In August 2012, the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron {{returned}} from a six-month tour in Afghanistan. Its 9 B-1Bs flew 770 sorties, {{the most of any}} B-1B squadron on a single deployment. The squadron spent 9,500 hours airborne, keeping one of its bombers in the air at all times. They accounted for a quarter of all combat aircraft sorties over the country during that time and fulfilled an average of two to three air support requests per day. On 4 September 2013, a B-1B participated in a maritime evaluation exercise, deploying munitions such as laser-guided 500lb GBU-54 bombs, 500lb and 2,000lb Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), and Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM). The aim was <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>and</b> engage several small craft using existing weapons and tactics developed from conventional warfare against ground targets; the B-1 is seen as a useful asset for maritime duties such as patrolling shipping lanes.|$|E
5|$|In Britain the {{campaign}} emphasised the important lesson previously {{demonstrated in the}} Trafalgar campaign of the year before, that it was immensely difficult in {{the vastness of the}} Atlantic Ocean <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>and</b> intercept French squadrons at sea: only off their own harbours and in the confined waters of the Caribbean were they vulnerable to detection and attack by British squadrons. The inadequate size and power of convoy escorts and the expense in resources employed in chasing French squadrons at sea meant that British trade was placed at risk by the depredations of independent French squadrons, and the maintenance of a tight blockade was essential. The British grip on French maritime travel was a constant source of irritation to Napoleon, who instigated a massive shipbuilding program with the intention of breaking the blockade: by 1808 he was able to muster over 80 ships of the line against the British blockade squadrons.|$|E

5|$|On 2 May 2007, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{issued a}} Safety Recommendation {{document}} that included an interim {{summary of the}} investigation to date, {{as well as some}} immediate safety recommendations that the NTSB believes should be implemented by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to enhance flight safety. The NTSB reported that the Embraer apparently experienced a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) outage, unknown to its flight crew prior to the collision, according to the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR):Preliminary findings in the ongoing investigation indicate that, for reasons yet to be determined, the collision avoidance system in the Legacy airplane was not functioning {{at the time of the}} accident, thereby disabling the system's ability <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>and</b> be detected by conflicting traffic. In addition, CVR data indicate that the flight crew was unaware that the collision avoidance system was not functioning until after the accident.|$|E
5|$|Some organisms, such as sharks, {{are able}} <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>and</b> respond {{to changes in}} {{electric}} fields, an ability known as electroreception, while others, termed electrogenic, are able to generate voltages themselves {{to serve as a}} predatory or defensive weapon. The order Gymnotiformes, of which the best known example is the electric eel, detect or stun their prey via high voltages generated from modified muscle cells called electrocytes. All animals transmit information along their cell membranes with voltage pulses called action potentials, whose functions include communication by the nervous system between neurons and muscles. An electric shock stimulates this system, and causes muscles to contract. Action potentials are also responsible for coordinating activities in certain plants.|$|E

5|$|The AW101 is {{equipped}} with the Blue Kestrel search and detection radar which is capable of 360 degree scanning and can detect small targets as far as 25 nautical miles. As part of the Royal Navy's Merlin HM2 upgrade program, Lockheed Martin implemented a series of improvements to the radar, notably allowing it to track 40 {{times the number of}} targets previously capable. Danish EH101s are fitted with the RDR-1600 search and weather radar. Royal Navy Merlins are equipped with the AQS901 anti-submarine system for processing sonographic data from sonobuoys <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>and</b> target submerged submarines. The AQS901 was derived from the system on the earlier Hawker Siddeley Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 was {{designed}} to be highly difficult <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>and</b> track by radar. Measures to reduce radar cross-section include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets that prevent line-of-sight of the engine faces from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return. The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye. The aircraft's flat thrust-vectoring nozzle reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing ("heat seeking") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special paint and active cooling of leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.|$|E

5|$|The {{wings of}} bats are much thinner and consist of more bones {{than that of}} birds, {{allowing}} bats to maneuver more accurately and fly with more lift and less drag. By folding the wings inwards towards their body on the upstroke, they use 35% less energy during flight than birds. The membranes are delicate, ripping easily; however, the tissue of the bat's membrane is able to regrow, such that small tears can heal quickly. The surface of their wings is equipped with touch-sensitive receptors on small bumps called Merkel cells, also found on human fingertips. These sensitive areas are different in bats, as each bump has a tiny hair in the center, making it even more sensitive and allowing the bat <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>and</b> collect information about the air flowing over its wings, and to fly more efficiently by changing the shape of its wings in response.|$|E
5|$|During their {{terrestrial}} phase, crested and marbled newts {{depend on}} a landscape that offers cover, invertebrate prey and humidity. The precise requirements of most species are still poorly known, as the newts are much more difficult <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>and</b> observe on land. Deciduous woodlands or groves are in general preferred, but conifer woods are also accepted, especially in the far northern and southern ranges. The southern marbled newt is typically found in Mediterranean oak forests. In the absence of forests, other cover-rich habitats, as for example hedgerows, scrub, swampy meadows, or quarries, can be inhabited. Within such habitats, the newts use hiding places such as logs, bark, planks, stone walls, or small mammal burrows; several individuals may occupy such refuges at the same time. Since the newts in general stay very close to their aquatic breeding sites, {{the quality of the}} surrounding terrestrial habitat largely determines whether an otherwise suitable water body will be colonised.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{development}} on WoA took place by porting code from Windows 7; Windows Mobile smartphones {{were used to}} test early builds of WoA {{because of lack of}} readily available ARM-based tablets. Later testing was performed using a custom-designed array of rack-mounted ARM-based systems. Changes to the Windows codebase were made to optimize the OS for the internal hardware of ARM devices, but a number of technical standards traditionally used by x86 systems are also used. WoA devices would use UEFI firmware, and have a software-based Trusted Platform Module to support device encryption and UEFI Secure Boot. ACPI is also used <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>and</b> control plug and play devices and provide power management outside the SoC. To enable wider hardware support, peripherals such as human interface devices, storage and other components that use USB and I²C connections use class drivers and standardized protocols.
