25|$|<b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is,</b> I'm finally {{working on}} my debut retail album. It sounds amazing so far. Everyone is excited about it. The bad news is, no more free music. Odds are, ever. No loopholes. Which means, Vampire Sunlight {{might be the last}} free release, and The Evil Microchip will not drop. Not even on YouTube. Sorry, Markus. But a major thank you is in order for {{everyone}} who's helped me this far. Everyone from Boe and Dre to Jimmy Iovine. All the graphic designers who have made covers, all the fans who uploaded my music, everyone. Thank you. My digital revolution has taken the Galaxy by storm, and I'm proud of it. It's just time to take things to a higher level. Hopefully, yall will support me. I'm not gonna throw the fact you've heard all my secrets for free in your face. But honestly, I would personally appreciate it if you went out and supported whatever I put in stores. More news to come, but once again, no free music indefinitely. Hold your head, kids...|$|E

500|$|He was not {{a typical}} movie actor, with a pudgy build and lacking matinée idol looks, but Hoffman claimed that he was {{grateful}} for his appearance as it made him believable {{in a wide range}} of roles. Joel Schumacher once said of him in 2000, [...] "The bad news is that Philip won't be a $25-million star. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> that he'll work for the rest of his life". The Aiken Standard of South Carolina referred to him as an [...] "anti-star", whose real identity remained [...] "amorphous and unmoored". Hoffman was acutely aware that he was often too unorthodox for the Academy voters. He remarked, [...] "I'm sure that people in the big corporations that run Hollywood don't know quite what to do with someone like me, but that's OK. I think there are other people who are interested in what I do." ...|$|E

500|$|The season saw {{drastic changes}} to the series' alien mythology. In the premiere episode, [...] "Herrenvolk", Williams—the actor who played Mulder's {{informant}} X—was written out of the show. He said that, [...] "Carter called me up personally [...] 'Got good news, got bad news. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> we're gonna bring you up for another episode this week. The bad news is you're gonna take a bullet." [...] The writers created a new character, Marita Covarrubias, to function as Mulder's informant. Carter felt it would be [...] "more interesting for Mulder's next contact to be a woman", noting that he [...] "wanted there to be some suspicion about whether Mulder would become involved with her romantically. [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] also introduced the killer bees, who {{would go on to}} play a larger part in the 1998 film. Carter described the fourth season as [...] "maybe the most intense and difficult season of the show." ...|$|E

I'm not really as flexible as I should be." [...] She still mourned the election loss, perhaps more than her husband did. [...] In a late February 2013 interview, she said, [...] "And you know, the other part of it was an amazing thing, and it was really quite a lot of energy and a lot of passion and a lot of – {{a lot of people around}} us and all of a sudden, it was nothing," [...] then adding, [...] "But <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> we like each other."

Leia Calderon of Comic Book Resources (CBR) gave it four-out-of-five stars writing, [...] "Overall, Bendis and Coipel's Civil War II #0 serves {{the sole purpose}} of laying out the foundation for the series. Despite being driven almost entirely by dialogue, it's never once boring, and the only real issue is the question on everyone's minds: Where is Iron Man?" [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave it an 8.3 out of 10 saying, [...] "Between the lackluster FCBD Special and Marvel's general track record with major crossovers, there's plenty of reason to worry about Civil War II. But <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> that this prologue issue makes a strong case for the upcoming event. It clearly lays out the brewing conflict and makes a strong case for both viewpoints." [...] David Pepose of Newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 and said, [...] "Minor flaws in the premise aside, Bendis and Coipel deliver some surprisingly charming work with Civil War II #0, which — at least thus far — doesn't feel like the shameless cash-in that you might expect from this summer event sequel." ...|$|E

He wrote, [...] "So, essentially doing a song like this is rocky ground, but <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> that Demi generally comes across as the kind of bright, scrappy, girl-next-door type, so it doesn't sound quite so preposterous when she insists that she's still quite normal, really."

500|$|On April 26, 2012, Sandoval hit {{a single}} in the fourth inning of {{a game against the}} Cincinnati Reds at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. This was the 19th {{consecutive}} game since Opening Day in which Sandoval had a hit, setting a Giants franchise record for longest consecutive hitting streak to begin a season. The previous record – of 18 games – was set by Johnny Rucker in 1945. Sandoval ran it up to 20 before it was snapped. However, in May, Sandoval fractured his left hamate bone, an injury which kept him out until early June. Giants' head athletic trainer Dave Groeschner said the day before Sandoval had surgery, [...] "I guess <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> both [...] will be gone tomorrow and he can't do it again." [...] On July 1, 2012, it was announced that Sandoval had beaten out David Wright for his second All-Star team, as the starting third baseman for the National League. The choice was considered somewhat controversial by fans and executives (particularly Sandy Alderson), as David Wright had a significantly higher batting average than Sandoval at the time. Wright made the team as a reserve, and as a reporter pointed out, Sandoval in 2009 [...] "outperformed Wright, who was the fans' choice to start." [...] On July 10, at Kansas City's Kauffman Stadium, Sandoval highlighted the NL's five-run opening inning with the first bases-loaded triple {{in the history of the}} Midsummer Classic, off of reigning American League (AL) Cy Young Award winner Justin Verlander.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{played in}} the World Series two years earlier, the 1986 Padres {{finished}} in fourth place in the National League West with a disappointing record of 74–88. The speculation that Boros would be fired proved accurate, as he was replaced by Larry Bowa on October 24, 1986. Boros said at the time, [...] "I was prepared {{for the fact that}} I wouldn't be coming back. ...

Since you don't get those moments from the production, the book or the leads, that leaves the featured ensemble, and in Follies that amounts to a small army. ... Marge Champion and Donald Saddler are endearing as the old hoofers. ... I dare you not {{to fall in love with}} Betty Garrett's understated [...] "Broadway Baby" [...] – you just want to pick her up and hug her.

2500|$|The {{hydrologist}} Peter Gleick comments: [...] "Few rational observers {{deny the}} need for boundaries to freshwater use. More controversial is defining where those limits are or what steps to take to constrain ourselves within them. Another way to describe these boundaries {{is the concept of}} peak water. Three different ideas are useful. 'Peak renewable' water limits are the total renewable flows in a watershed. Many of the world’s major rivers are already approaching this threshold—when evaporation and consumption surpass natural replenishment from precipitation and other sources. 'Peak nonrenewable' limits apply where human use of water far exceeds natural recharge rates, such as in fossil groundwater basins of the Great Plains, Libya, India, northern China and parts of California’s Central Valley. 'Peak ecological' water is the idea that for any hydrological system, increasing withdrawals eventually reach the point where any additional economic benefit of taking the water is outweighed by the additional ecological destruction that causes. Although it is difficult to quantify this point accurately, we have clearly passed the point of peak ecological water in many basins around the world where huge damage has occurred [...] <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> that the potential for savings, without hurting human health or economic productivity, is vast. Improvements in water-use efficiency are possible in every sector. More food can be grown with less water (and less water contamination) by shifting from conventional flood irrigation to drip and precision sprinklers, along with more accurately monitoring and managing soil moisture. Conventional power plants can change from water cooling to dry cooling, and more energy can be generated by sources that use extremely little water, such as photovoltaics and wind." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{response}} to some early negative reactions to the actress' performance, Jon Lachonis noted {{in a review of}} the first season's seventh episode that [...] "Anna Torv, whose chill portrayal of FBI agent and Pattern investigator Olivia Dunham has come under fire for being too wooden, seems to have reinvented her character to answer the critics. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is,</b> Anna's new and more animated Olivia isn't really a departure so much as it is a character who seems to have had a catharsis. She is comfortable in her skin now, and the stillness is pulled back in favor of more humanity. Of course, it is helpful that she reunites with an old beau in this episode - if there is one thing Fringe is totally lacking it is sexual tension." [...] Executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman defended Torv's early Fringe work in a 2011 interview, explaining the character was designed to be [...] "bland, because of her conditioning as a child and everything she's been through. Now, one can argue that maybe that wasn't the best way for us to introduce the main character, but there was a purpose. So Anna had to listen to all these people saying 'She's really doing nothing,' when really it was our issue. We didn't write anything for her because... well, now you know why. But at the time, people were like, 'Wow, this girl really is not much,' which is so not true. Anna was just so professional, and so great. She did it with excellence, and now she's really getting the chance to show people, 'Hey, I'm a really hard worker and a terrific actor.' We're so thankful that people can start to see her for who she really is. Midway through the second season, Sarah Stegall from SFScope believed Torv [...] "had the most progress and the most satisfying development" [...] of all the main actors, stating she [...] "is now carrying this role with grace and strength". Stegall partly attributed the growth of the actor and character to her recovery early in the second season, the introduction of a sister and niece, the removal of John Scott from her storyline, and the [...] "delicate, reserved flirtation" [...] with Peter.|$|E
