5|$|Abbotsford Bridge is a steel Allan truss-type bridge {{spanning}} the Murray River between Curlwaa, New South Wales, and Yelta, Victoria. It {{is the only}} remaining steel truss bridge with a lift span <b>that</b> <b>crosses</b> the Murray. Opened in 1928, the bridge was built by the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Public Works and was designed by Percy Allan. It was the second last lift-span bridge to be built over the river, the last being the Nyah Bridge, which opened in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Communities {{have formed}} around the creation, play and {{discussion}} of LARP. These communities have developed a subculture <b>that</b> <b>crosses</b> over with role-playing, fan, reenactment, and drama subcultures. Early LARP subculture focused on Tolkien-like fantasy, but it later broadened to include appreciation of other genres, especially the horror genre with the rapid uptake of the World of Darkness setting in the 1990s. Like many subcultures, LARP groups often have a common context of shared experience, language, humour, and clothing that can be regarded {{by some as a}} lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|In 1735, Euler {{presented}} {{a solution to}} the problem known as the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path <b>that</b> <b>crosses</b> each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory, specifically of planar graph theory.|$|E
5|$|September 8, 1996- Hurricane Fran {{passes to}} the west of the state through central Pennsylvania and western New York and sparks an intense line of severe {{thunderstorms}} <b>that</b> <b>crosses</b> New Jersey and is most notable for causing an hour-long lightning delay of an NFL game between the New York Jets and Indianapolis Colts at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford. This marked the first time a regular season NFL contest had been suspended due to weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|The next {{plan for}} the Channel Tunnel Rail Link {{involved}} a tunnel reaching London from the south-east, and an underground terminus {{in the vicinity of}} King's Cross station. A late change in the plans, principally driven by the then Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine's desire for urban regeneration in east London, led to a change of route, with the new line approaching London from the east. This opened the possibility of reusing the underused St Pancras station as the terminus, with access via the North London Line <b>that</b> <b>crosses</b> the throat of the station.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening in}} 1885 of the Saint-Louis–Dakar railway {{increased}} the traffic over the bridge. The railway reached {{all the way}} to Sor and all the goods hauled between the coast and the railway station had to cross over the bridge. To prevent the breakdown of the bridge a special decree was given so that the maximum weight for a vehicle <b>that</b> <b>crosses</b> the bridge to be less than one and a half tonnes. With all its difficulties the bridge remained in service 32 years, until 1897 when it was dismantled.|$|E
5|$|The town {{is served}} by the A35 autoroute, a {{motorway}} <b>that</b> <b>crosses</b> Alsace north to south, connecting Strasbourg, Colmar and Mulhouse. Further south it connects to the Swiss A3 motorway, and further north to the German B9 highway. Taken together, these three roads connect the Netherlands to Austria.

5|$|After {{crossing}} through Jarbo Gap, SR 70 {{drops down}} into the canyon of the North Fork Feather River, which it follows almost to Quincy, usually {{on the opposite side}} from the Feather River Route; this results in two places where both transportation lines cross the river and each other. The first of these is the Pulga Bridge, an arch bridge <b>that</b> <b>crosses</b> over a lower railroad truss bridge; soon after are the highway's three tunnels through rock formations in the canyon. After a fair distance through the canyon, and that formed by the East Branch North Fork Feather River, SR 70 reaches the junction with State Route 89 near Paxton; Routes 70 and 89 overlap southeast from that point, where the East Branch splits into Indian Creek and Spanish Creek.|$|E
5|$|As {{the route}} heads through Ashland, it {{generally}} {{turns to the}} southeast to match the curvature of the Chemung River valley, which contains the river, NY427, and the Southern Tier Expressway (NY17). NY427 parallels both {{the river and the}} expressway into Wellsburg, a small village sandwiched between the Chemung River and the Pennsylvania state line. In the center of the village, NY427, named Front Street, intersects with the northern end of NY367, a short highway linking NY427 to the Pennsylvania border. Just east of NY367, NY427 intersects County Route8 (CR8), a highway <b>that</b> <b>crosses</b> the Chemung River and links Wellsburg to NY17 at exit58.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 5 runs north-south {{through the}} middle of the city and crosses the Willamette River on the Boone Bridge. Wilsonville has two {{interchanges}} with the freeway north of the river, at Wilsonville Road on the south and where Boones Ferry Road meets Elligsen Road on the north end of town. To the south of the river, the Charbonneau interchange crosses I-5 at the southern limit of the city. Boeckman Road is the only other street <b>that</b> <b>crosses</b> I-5 and links the western and eastern parts of Wilsonville. Wilsonville Road, 95th Avenue, Boones Ferry Road (northern portion is Oregon Route 141), Boeckman Road, Town Center Loop, French Prairie Drive, Elligsen Road, Parkway Avenue, and Stafford Road are the main roads in the city.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a {{setting in which}} two firms first choose equity positions in each others stock (cross holdings) and then compete in an imperfect product market. We demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>cross</b> holdings lead to higher firm profits and higher consumer surplus when the competitors’ products are complements. We find <b>that</b> <b>cross</b> holdings lead to lower firm profits and higher consumer surplus when the products are substitutes. This finding {{is in contrast to}} the existing literature which establishes <b>that</b> <b>cross</b> holdings leads to higher firm profits and to lower consumer surplus. The contrasting results emerge because we solve for optimal cross holdings, whereas the existing literature considers exogenous cross holdings. In addition, allowing optimal cross holdings improves economic welfare.

5|$|Leaving Placerville, the {{expressway}} {{through town}} starts, only to end several miles later. The final section of freeway, {{known as the}} El Dorado Freeway, begins near Camino, where the Lincoln Highway splits from US 50, and ends at {{the east end of}} Pollock Pines. Just east of Pollock Pines, US 50 continues as an undivided conventional highway with one eastbound lane and two westbound lanes, entering the river canyon of the South Fork American River near Riverton and crossing to {{the north side of the}} river near Ice House Road. From Ice House Road to the crest of the Sierras, US 50 is a steadily rising mostly two-lane road, staying just north of the river except for a 1995 cutoff <b>that</b> <b>crosses</b> the river twice in quick succession west of Kyburz, the boyhood home of ski racer Spider Sabich.|$|E
5|$|Route 120 passes {{between the}} Meadowlands Racetrack and New Jersey Transit's Meadowlands Rail Line on the East Rutherford {{side of the}} road and {{commercial}} and industrial areas on the Carlstadt {{side of the road}}, intersecting with Gotham Parkway. The route has a southbound exit and entrance to the Meadowlands Sports Complex before it crosses Berrys Creek. Upon crossing the creek, Route 120 continues northwest through industrial and commercial areas, intersecting with Murray Hill Parkway. A short distance past this intersection, the road becomes a four-lane undivided road <b>that</b> <b>crosses</b> New Jersey Transit’s Pascack Valley Line before coming to an interchange with Route 17. Here, Route 120 ends and County Route 120 continues to the west as Paterson Avenue.|$|E

The two routes run concurrent to the northwest, becoming a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane <b>that</b> <b>crosses</b> entirely into East Amwell Township before resuming along the border of East and West Amwell Townships. The road becomes a divided highway and crosses entirely into East Amwell Township again before it comes to an interchange with US202, where CR579 continues north into Ringoes and Route31 heads north along US202, a four-lane, divided highway with intersections featuring jughandle ramps.|$|E
