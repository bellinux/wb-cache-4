40|$|Background and purpose: Multiple choice <b>tests</b> are {{the most}} common type of <b>tests</b> used in {{evaluating}} the general English knowledge of the students in most medical universities, however the efficacy of these <b>tests</b> are not examined precisely. Wecompare and examine the integrative <b>tests</b> and discrete point <b>tests</b> as measures of the English language knowledge of medical students. Methods: Three <b>tests</b> were given to 60 undergraduate physiotherapy and Audiology students in their second year of study (after passing their general English course). They were divided into 2 groups. The first <b>test</b> for both groups was an integrative <b>test,</b> writing. The second <b>test</b> was a multiple - choice <b>test</b> 0. (prepositions for group one and a multiple - choice <b>test</b> of tensesfor group two. The same items which were mostfi-equently used wrongly in thefirst <b>test</b> were used in the items of the second <b>test.</b> A third <b>test,</b> a TOEFL, was given to the subjects in order to estimate the correlation between this <b>test</b> and <b>tests</b> <b>one</b> and <b>two.</b> Results: The students performed better in the second <b>test,</b> discrete point <b>test</b> rather than the first which was an integrative <b>test.</b> The same grammatical mistakes in the composition were used correctly in the multiple choice <b>tests</b> by the students. Conclusion:Our findings show that student perform better in non-productive rather than productive <b>test.</b> Since being competent English language user is an expected outcome of university language courses it seems warranted to switch to integrative <b>tests</b> as a measure of English language competency.

40|$|From the {{pioneering}} {{efforts of the}} early 1960 2 ̆ 7 s, flexography has shown steady progress {{in the development of}} four color process printing. However, the ability to consistently produce it is limited to an elite group. The vast majority of companies have yet to competitively enter this demanding area of printing. For these companies the time, expense, and expertise required to conduct an indepth study is a major deterrent. Outside information must be made available to aid the companies. The FTA and its members have greatly contributed by publishing an array of information; although, some basic questions have yet to be answered. Of these questions, proper screen angling for the elimination of moire 2 ̆ 7 patterns is an open topic. The occurrence of moire 2 ̆ 7 patterns in flexography {{is the result of the}} 45 degree cellular pattern of the anilox combined with the 45 degree tonal pattern of the plate image. To eliminate the moire 2 ̆ 7, most f lexographers 2 ̆ 2 offset 2 ̆ 2 the four screening angles by a predetermined amount. For example, instead of screening at 45, 75, 90, and 105 degrees, a company may screen at 52, 82, 97, and 112 degrees. The recommendation of offsetting the four screening angles was given in 1968 and was based on <b>tests</b> conducted with 200 and 220 anilox rolls. Since that time, Parmarco, Inc., has introduced finer count anilox rolls under the trade name of 2 ̆ 2 Tone and Process. 2 ̆ 2 It is the belief of Mr. Douglas E. Tuttle, Vice President, Marketing, Parmarco, Inc., that when using Tone and Process anilox rolls, the following is true: [1] A moire 2 ̆ 7 will not be produced with the 45 degree plate image. [2] The standard angles can be used by f lexographers when printing four color process work via flexography. [3] A Tone and Process anilox roll will produce a moire 1 once it is sufficiently worn. The thesis hypothesis addresses the topic of screen angling when printing four color process work with 4 00 TPB anilox rolls and 100 line plate images. The methodology focuses on three separate <b>tests.</b> <b>Tests</b> <b>one</b> and <b>two</b> investigate the suggestion that the standard angles can be used without a moire 2 ̆ 7 appearing in the final print. Test three considers the suggestion that a moire 1 will be produced with the 45 degree printer once the 400 TPB anilox is sufficiently worn. The results of <b>tests</b> <b>one</b> and <b>two</b> support the hypothesis that the standard angles of 45, 75, 90, and 105 degrees can be used by the flexographer when printing with 4 00 TPB anilox rolls and 100 line plate images. It is also concluded that a 400 TPB anilox will produce a moire 2 ̆ 7 once it is sufficiently worn...|$|R

To systematically review the measurement properties (i. e. internal consistency, reproducibility, validity, responsiveness and interpretability) of all performance-based methods which {{have been used to}} measure the physical function of patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Methods. A systematic search was conducted in Medline, CINAHL, PsychINFO and Embase. Standardized criteria were applied to assess the quality of the clinimetric studies and the measurement properties. Results. Twenty-six performance-based methods were included: 13 walking <b>tests,</b> <b>two</b> stair-climb <b>tests,</b> <b>one</b> chair <b>test</b> and ten multi-item <b>tests.</b> Three out of seven multi-activity <b>tests</b> were <b>tested</b> for internal consistency and two were rated positively. Fourteen <b>tests</b> were <b>tested</b> for reliability and five were rated positively. The absolute measurement error (agreement) was assessed for 10 <b>tests.</b> Only <b>one</b> <b>test</b> received a positive rating. Fourteen <b>tests</b> were <b>tested</b> for construct validity. Only two <b>tests</b> received positive ratings. Responsiveness was assessed for 12 <b>tests,</b> but none of them received a positive rating.

Many more well-designed studies are needed to assess the measurement properties of performance-based methods.
