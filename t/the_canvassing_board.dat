5000|$|According to the Minnesota Statutes, [...] "the state {{canvassing}} board shall consist {{of the secretary}} of state, two judges of the supreme court, and two judges of the district court selected by the secretary of state. None of the judges shall be a candidate at the election. If a judge fails to appear at the meeting of <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> <b>board,</b> the secretary of state shall fill the vacancy in membership by selecting another judge who is not a candidate at the election. Not more than two judges of the supreme court shall serve on <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> <b>board</b> at one time".|$|E
50|$|When a voter's {{right to}} vote was {{challenged}}, state laws typicallyallowed them to cast a challenged ballot. After the polls closed, <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> <b>board</b> was then charged with examining the challenged ballots and determining whether the challenge was to be upheld or not.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Canvassing</b> <b>Board</b> {{finished}} the recount, {{the next step}} was for the state to issue an official certificate of election. State law requires a seven-day delay from the Canvassing Board's final report until the certificate can be issued and signed by Ritchie and Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty. Furthermore, state law states that a certificate cannot be issued if an election contest is pending.|$|E
5000|$|How such recounts in {{the case}} at hand {{could be made to}} fit into the {{statutory}} scheme, which, as Harris interpreted it, contemplated a quick certification followed, if necessary, by an election contest during which a court (rather than <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> <b>boards)</b> would be empowered to correct errors.|$|R

5000|$|During the 2000 election, Sweeney {{allegedly}} helped {{earn his}} nickname from President Bush, [...] "Congressman Kick-Ass," [...] by organizing the so-called Brooks Brothers riot that disrupted the Florida elections commissioners. [...] He {{was said to}} have led the charge on the third recount in Miami, flying in astroturfing GOP operatives and instructing them to [...] "shut it down!" [...] by raising a clamor and pounding on the election commission's doors. Sweeney used the words [...] "thugs" [...] to describe the Florida officials involved in the recount. He defended his actions in connection with the incident as [...] "completely and absolutely legitimate" [...] and declared that his intent was only to stop <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> <b>board</b> from withdrawing its activities from public view.|$|E
50|$|The 2008 U.S. Senate race {{initially}} had {{a margin}} of 206 votes separating incumbent Republican Senator Norm Coleman and Democratic challenger Al Franken, out of almost three million votes cast. The narrow margin in this election mandated astate-wide recount of all ballots. The recount was run by the nonpartisan Minnesota Canvassing Board which was chaired by Ritchie, and included Minnesota Supreme Court Chief Justice Eric Magnuson, Minnesota Supreme Court Justice G. Barry Anderson, Ramsey County District Court Chief Judge Kathleen Gearin, and Assistant Chief Judge Edward Cleary. Some conservative commentators accused Ritchie of bias during the Senate recount, saying {{the fact that he}} accepted contributions and an endorsement from ACORN during his 2006 campaign compromised his integrity as Secretary of State. Most Minnesotans were generally supportive of Ritchie, <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> <b>board,</b> and the way that election and recount were handled, as shown by polls taken at the time and statements from public figures, including Republicans such as Governor Tim Pawlenty and previous Secretary of State Mary Kiffmeyer.|$|E
5000|$|One of the last—and largest—sources of {{uncertainty}} was the absentee ballots {{that had been}} improperly rejected by election officials during the original count. Franken's campaign asked for these ballots to be tallied by each county and counted in the recount results, while Coleman's campaign said <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> <b>board</b> {{did not have the}} authority to deal with the ballots. On December 8, some counties began sorting rejected absentee ballots to find out how many were incorrectly rejected. On December 12, the Board voted unanimously to recommend counties sort through their rejected absentee ballots, setting aside any that were incorrectly rejected, and resubmit their vote totals with the incorrectly rejected ballots included. The Coleman campaign filed suit with the state Supreme Court to temporarily halt such counting until [...] "a standard procedure" [...] could be determined, but the State Supreme Court ruled on December 18 that the improperly rejected absentee ballots be included in the recount. The Court also prescribed that a standard procedure be established by the Secretary of State's office in conjunction with the two campaigns.|$|E
50|$|In {{accordance}} with state law, <b>the</b> Minnesota State <b>Canvassing</b> <b>Board</b> ordered a hand recount in the Senate race. Representatives of Coleman and Franken observed the sorting and recounting of the ballots at 120 locations {{across the state}} on November 19, and largely finished on December 5. The votes were counted locally, but ballots that were challenged by either campaign {{were sent to the}} state capital for consideration by <b>the</b> State <b>Canvassing</b> <b>Board.</b> <b>The</b> board was a five-person panel consisting of Secretary of State Mark Ritchie, Minnesota Supreme Court Chief Justice Eric Magnuson, Justice G. Barry Anderson, Ramsey County District Court Chief Judge Kathleen Gearin, and Assistant Chief Judge Edward Cleary; they made determination of the voters' intent for ballots where either of the campaign's representatives disagreed with the election officials at the county sites. Of <b>the</b> five <b>Canvassing</b> <b>Board</b> members, Ritchie was an elected DFLer, the two justices were appointed by a Republican governor, one judge was appointed by an Independence Party governor, and one was elected in a non-partisan election.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> state <b>canvassing</b> <b>board</b> {{certified}} <b>the</b> recounted vote totals on January 5 with Franken {{ahead by}} 225 votes. Former Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson, a Republican {{who did not}} endorse a candidate in the 2008 Senate race, called for Coleman to concede.|$|R
5000|$|Rich {{served as}} Governor of Michigan from 1893 to 1897. During his {{four years in}} office, a {{railroad}} strike, {{as well as an}} iron mine strike occurred.

5000|$|The {{demonstration}} {{was organized}} by Republican operatives, {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "Brooks Brothers Brigade", to oppose the recount of ballots during the Florida election recount. Realizing that they could not meet a court-ordered deadline, the canvassers decided to limit the recount to the 10,750 ballots rejected by computer, and moved the counting process to a smaller room closer to the ballot-scanning equipment to speed up the process, while restricting media access to 25 feet away while they continued. Republicans objected to this change of plans and insisted the canvassers must do a full recount. At this time, New York Rep. John Sweeney told an aide to [...] "Shut it down." [...] The demonstration turned violent, and according to the NY Times, [...] "several people were trampled, punched or kicked when protesters tried to rush the doors outside the office of the Miami-Dade supervisor of elections. Sheriff's deputies restored order." [...] DNC aide Luis Rosero was kicked and punched. Within two hours after the riot died down, <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> <b>board</b> unanimously voted to shut down the count, in part due to perceptions that the process wasn't open or fair, and in part because the court-mandated deadline was impossible to meet.|$|E

50|$|When {{the initial}} count was {{completed}} on November 18, Franken was trailing Coleman by 215 votes. This close margin triggered a mandatory recount. After reviewing ballots {{that had been}} challenged during the recount and counting 953 wrongly rejected absentee ballots, <b>the</b> State <b>Canvassing</b> <b>Board</b> officially certified <b>the</b> recount results with Franken holding a 225-vote lead.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the recount, each {{candidate}} had gained votes. In total, Coleman had challenged 3,377 ballots and Franken had challenged 3,278. These ballots were set aside until <b>the</b> State <b>Canvassing</b> <b>Board</b> could meet on December 16 to decide the fate of challenged ballots. Ritchie's office, however, insisted that each campaign voluntarily withdraw some of their challenges, due to the strain a large pile of ballot challenges would place on <b>the</b> State <b>Canvassing</b> <b>Board.</b> On December 3, Franken's campaign withdrew 633 of their challenges, and said that they would withdraw more at a later date. The next day, Coleman's campaign responded by withdrawing 650 challenges. By the time all of the ballots that Franken's campaign challenged were examined, he had only 420 challenges left that had not been withdrawn, while Coleman's campaign had roughly 1,000. The Secretary of State's website had noted that none of the withdrawn ballot challenges were reflected in the running tally of the recount.|$|R
5000|$|Texas Senator John Cornyn {{said that}} GOP {{senators}} {{were prepared to}} filibuster the seating of <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> <b>board's</b> declared winner until a signed election certificate is available, as provided under Minnesota law. On January 21, 2009, {{the day after the}} inauguration of Democratic President Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said that Senate Democrats are [...] "going to try to seat Al Franken" [...] at least provisionally until the challenge is resolved. Reid also said that there was [...] "not a question in anyone's mind [...] [...] [...] that there's been any fraud or wrongdoing in this election." [...] Senate Republican leaders countered this by insisting that Franken respect Minnesota laws and allow the completion of the legal review.|$|R
5000|$|On January 12, 2009, Franken filed {{a motion}} to dismiss Coleman's contest, {{claiming}} it was [...] "an imprecise and scattershot pleading". He argued {{that even if the}} contest were to proceed, the three-judge panel should be limited to determining who would be awarded the already certified ballots and to a simple, mathematical recount to ensure the accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> <b>board's</b> count, while no additional ballots should be reviewed. On January 22, 2009, Franken's attorneys also argued that the case should not go to trial because the U.S. Senate itself, rather than the court system, has the power under the United States Constitution to judge the election of its own members. Franken's motion to dismiss was denied by the panel on January 23.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding {{the second}} issue, {{the court ruled}} that the {{statutory}} scheme must be interpreted in light of the Florida state constitution's declaration that [...] "all political power is inherent in the people," [...] with any ambiguities therefore construed [...] "liberally." [...] Preventing <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> <b>boards</b> from continuing to conduct recounts beyond the seven-day timeframe (specified in the law, but with ambiguity as to how firm it was intended to be), would [...] "summarily disenfranchise innocent electors voters" [...] and could not be allowed unless the recounts continued for so long as to [...] "compromise the integrity of the electoral process." [...] The court ordered counties to submit returns by November 26, until which time the stay of certification would stand.|$|R

50|$|Some {{media reports}} focused on undervotes (chad blocked hole, wrong ink or pencil used, partial oval mark not detected, {{humidity}} affected scanner, ballot feeder misalignment), while others also included overvotes (hole punched or oval filled plus a write-in name, other multi-marked ballots). A larger consortium of news organizations, including USA Today, The Miami Herald, Knight Ridder, The Tampa Tribune, {{and five other}} newspapers next conducted a full recount of all machine-rejected ballots, including both undervotes and overvotes. The organization analyzed 171,908 ballots (60,647 undervotes and 111,261 overvotes), 3102 less than the later NORC study. According to their results, Bush won under stricter standards and Gore won under looser standards. A Gore win was impossible without a recount of overvotes, {{which he did not}} request; however, faxes between Judge Terry Lewis and <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> <b>boards</b> throughout <b>the</b> state indicated that Lewis, who oversaw the recount effort, intended to have overvotes counted.|$|R

2500|$|Most of the post-electoral {{controversy}} {{revolved around}} Gore's request for hand recounts in four counties (Broward, Miami Dade, Palm Beach, and Volusia), as provided under Florida state law. Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris (also the co-chair of George W. Bush's election efforts in Florida) announced she would reject any revised totals from those counties {{if they were}} not turned in by 5:00p.m. on November 14, the statutory deadline for amended returns. The Florida Supreme Court extended the deadline to November 26, a decision later vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court. Miami-Dade eventually halted its recount and resubmitted its original total to <b>the</b> state <b>canvassing</b> <b>board,</b> while Palm Beach County failed to meet the extended deadline, turning in its completed recount results at 7:00p.m., which Harris indeed rejected. On November 26, <b>the</b> state <b>canvassing</b> <b>board</b> certified Bush <b>the</b> winner of Florida's electors by 537 votes. Gore formally contested the certified results. A state court decision overruling Gore was reversed by the Florida Supreme Court, which ordered a recount of over 70,000 ballots previously rejected as undervotes by machine counters. The U.S. Supreme Court halted that order the next day, with Justice Scalia issuing a concurring opinion that [...] "the counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner" [...] (Bush).|$|R
50|$|Under Minnesota law {{the chief}} justice of the state Supreme Court {{appoints}} a three-judge panel to hear an election contest.

50|$|An {{effort to}} recall Alvarez began in October 2010, backed by billionaire {{businessman}} Norman Braman, a former {{owner of the}} Philadelphia Eagles, over Alvarez's simultaneous tax increases and pay raises for upper echelon county workers. Braman spent more than $1 {{million of his own}} money on the effort. Alvarez was recalled in a March 15, 2011, election. More than 88% of the voters (some 176,000 people) voted for recalling Alvarez. The election was the largest municipal recall vote in United States history, and the 2nd largest in the U.S. of any kind, after the 2003 recall election of California governor Gray Davis. He officially left office on March 18, 2011, when <b>the</b> county <b>canvassing</b> <b>board</b> certified <b>the</b> results.|$|R

Logan admitted the lost ballots were an oversight {{on the part of}} his department, and insisted that the found ballots be counted. On December 15, <b>the</b> King County <b>Canvassing</b> <b>Board</b> voted 2-1 in favor of counting the discovered ballots.|$|R

5000|$|On March 2, the Coleman team rested {{its case}} after {{five weeks of}} testimony. The contest resumed on March 3 with the Franken team {{presenting}} its counter arguments. On March 13, the trial portion of the contest concluded with closing argument from both sides. Franken's closing was delivered by attorney Kevin Hamilton and Coleman's by Joseph Friedburg. After the closing arguments, Franken lead attorney Marc Elias stated: [...] "After seven weeks of trial, hundreds of witnesses, and thousands of exhibits, the trial demonstrated what <b>the</b> state <b>canvassing</b> <b>board</b> found to be true after an exhaustive recount: that Al Franken got more votes on Election Day than Norm Coleman. We remain confident that the court will uphold {{the results of the}} election and allow Al Franken to begin the work the voters of Minnesota hired him to do." ...|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{unofficial}} results were first {{posted on the}} Minnesota Secretary of State's website, Coleman's lead had narrowed from 726 votes on November 5 to the official pre-recount tally of 215 votes on November 18. Secretary of State Mark Ritchie called these changes [...] "well within the normal range in the days immediately following an election, when county officials double check and verify election night tabulations reported {{to the secretary of}} state's office," [...] while Coleman's campaign decried the [...] "improbable shifts that are overwhelmingly accruing to the benefit of Al Franken." [...] An independent analysis of statewide elections over the prior 10 years showed that the average change in vote totals as reported on election night compared to the certified result is 1,500 votes.

50|$|Preliminary {{reports on}} {{election}} night, November 4, had Coleman ahead by over 700 votes, but the official results certified on November 18, 2008, had Coleman leading by only 215 votes. As {{the two candidates}} were separated by less than 0.5 percent, the Secretary of State of Minnesota, Mark Ritchie, authorized an automatic recount provided for in Minnesota election law. In the recount, ballots and certifying materials were examined by hand, and candidates could file challenges to the legality of ballots or materials for inclusion or exclusion {{with regard to the}} recount.

50|$|Though party {{officials}} usually remain neutral in primaries, Heller was endorsed over Liz McCallum by several Pinellas Democrats {{in the contest}} to decide who would run to succeed Frank Farkas. These included County Commissioner Calvin Harris, State Representatives Charlie Justice and Frank Peterman, Jr. as well as St. Petersburg City Council members James Bennett, Rick Kriseman, and Rene Flowers, and School Board member Linda Lerner. County Commissioner Ken Welch remained neutral as he sat on <b>the</b> county <b>canvassing</b> <b>board.</b> McCallum had narrowly lost to Farkas in the 2004 election, by less than 3,000 votes. Despite McCallum's strong showing in 2004, Heller was encouraged to run by colleague Betty Castor, {{a former president of}} USF and former Florida Secretary of Education. He came into the race at a time when McCallum had been running about a year. He had remained active in the community after stepping down as head of the St. Petersburg campus, with membership on the boards of directors of Bayfront Medical Center, the Community Foundation of Tampa Bay, Great Explorations museum, Florida International Museum and Pinellas Association of Retarded Children. He cited his education experience and ties to the community as important qualities.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the statewide}} machine recount, the Gore {{campaign}} requested a manual recount in four counties. Florida state {{law at the}} time allowed a candidate to request a manual recount by protesting the results {{of at least three}} precincts. <b>The</b> county <b>canvassing</b> <b>board</b> was then to decide whether to do a recount, as well as the method of the recount, in those three precincts. If the board discovered an error that in its judgment could affect the outcome of the election, they were then authorized to do a full recount of the ballots. This statutory process primarily accommodated recounts for local elections. The Gore campaign requested that disputed ballots in Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Volusia Counties be counted by hand. Volusia County started its recount on November 12. Florida statutes also required that all counties certify and report their returns, including any recounts, by 5:00 p.m. on November 14. The manual recounts were time-consuming, and {{it soon became clear that}} some counties would not complete their recounts before the deadline. On November 13 the Gore campaign and Volusia and Palm Beach Counties sued to have the deadlines extended.|$|R
