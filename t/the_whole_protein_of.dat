40|$|Plant {{cells are}} {{considered}} to possess functionally different types of vacuoles in the same cell. One of the papers cited {{in support of this}} concept reported that protein storage and lytic vacuoles in root tips of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and pea (Pisum sativum) seedlings were initially separate compartments that later fused to form a central vacuole during cell elongation. We have reinvestigated the situation in these two roots using immunogold electron microscopy as well as immunofluorescence microscopy of histological sections. Using antisera generated against <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>protein</b> <b>of</b> α-tonoplast intrinsic protein (TIP) as well as specific C-terminal TIP peptide antisera against α-, γ-, and δ-TIP, together with antisera against the storage proteins barley lectin and pea legumin and vicilin, we were unable to obtain evidence for separate vacuole populations. Instead, our observations point to the formation of a single type of vacuole in cells differentiating both proximally and distally from the root meristem. This is a hybrid-type vacuole containing storage proteins and having both α- and γ-TIPs, but not δ-TIP, in its tonoplast. As cells differentiate toward the zone of elongation, their vacuoles are characterized by increasing amounts of γ-TIP and decreasing amounts of α-TIP...|$|E
40|$|In the {{application}} of saturation transfer difference (STD) experiments {{to the study of}} protein-ligand interactions, the relaxation of the ligand {{is one of the major}} influences on the experimentally observed STD factors, making interpretation of these difficult when attempting to define a group epitope map (GEM). In this paper, we describe a simplification of the relaxation matrix that may be applied under specified experimental conditions, which results in a simplified equation reflecting the directly transferred magnetisation rate from the protein onto the ligand, defined as the summation over <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>protein</b> <b>of</b> the protein-ligand cross-relaxation multiplied by with the fractional saturation of the protein protons. In this, the relaxation of the ligand is accounted for implicitly by inclusion of the experimentally determined longitudinal relaxation rates. The conditions under which this "group epitope mapping considering relaxation of the ligand" (GEM-CRL) can be applied were tested on a theoretical model system, which demonstrated only minor deviations from that predicted by the full relaxation matrix calculations (CORCEMA-ST) [7]. Furthermore, CORCEMA-ST calculations of two protein-saccharide complexes (Jacalin and TreR) with known crystal structures were performed and compared with experimental GEM-CRL data. It could be shown that the GEM-CRL methodology is superior to the classical group epitope mapping approach currently used for defining ligand-protein proximities. GEM-CRL is also useful for the interpretation of CORCEMA-ST results, because the transferred magnetisation rate provides an additional parameter for the comparison between measured and calculated values. The independence of this parameter from the above mentioned factors can thereby enhance the value of CORCEMA-ST calculations...|$|E

However, there are records in the literature of the synthesis <b>of</b> a <b>protein</b> by other means. Using pepsin, Wasteneys and Borsook (4) have shown {{that it is possible to}} synthesise a protein-like substance (plastein) from the products of peptic hydrolysis of egg albumin. Whether their method when applied to peptic digests of insulin would produce a protein-like substance, with or without physiological activity, seemed worthy of investigation. If a plastein was formed during synthesis it seemed reasonable to expect that it might be physiologically active for various reasons: In the first place, insulin, presumably, is synthesised in the body by some enzyme or system of enzymes. Secondly, Beard (5) showed that the plastein obtained in the albumin experiments exhibited a striking resemblance to the original albumin in that the plastein possessed a similar nutritional value. Finally, the possibility of foreign substances taking part in the synthesis of plastein from an insulin digest was greatly reduced by the use of crystalline insulin and crystalline pepsin.

Heat treatment of the irradiated virus (20 min at 54 degrees C) reduced the density to 1. 40 g/cm 3 and led to the loss of approximately 55 % of the labeled RNA from the virions.

Irradiation also resulted in an increase in the accessibility of RNA inside the virions to the action of pancreatic RNase. An increase in the UV dose did not enlarge the fraction of RNA molecules covalently linked to protein; this was revealed by the lack of any secondary increase in the apparent RNase resistance of the labeled RNA in the irradiated virions.

It contains a tra unit likely involved in conjugative DNA transfer and lgrE, a 5. 6 -kb gene similar to five others of P. amoebophila : lgrA to lgrD, lgrF. We describe here the structure, regulation and evolution <b>of</b> these <b>proteins</b> termed LGRs since encoded by "Large G+C-Rich" genes. Results No homologs to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>protein</b> sequence <b>of</b> LGRs {{were found in}} other organisms. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that serial duplications producing the six LGRs occurred relatively recently and nucleotide usage analyses show that lgrB, lgrE and lgrF were relocated on the chromosome. The C-terminal part of LGRs is homologous to Leucine-Rich Repeats domains (LRRs). Defined by a cumulative alignment score, the 5 to 18 concatenated octacosapeptidic (28 -meric) LRRs of LGRs present all a predicted α-helix conformation. Their closest homologs are the 28 -residue RI-like LRRs of mammalian NODs and the 24 -meres of some Ralstonia and Legionella proteins. Interestingly, lgrE, which is present on Pam 100 G like the tra operon, exhibits Pfam domains related to DNA metabolism. Conclusion Comparison of the LRRs, enable us to propose a parsimonious evolutionary scenario of these domains driven by adjacent concatenations of LRRs. Our model established on bacterial LRRs can be challenged in eucaryotic proteins carrying less conserved LRRs, such as NOD proteins and Toll-like receptors. </p...|$|R

40|$|Studies on {{bacterial}} <b>whole</b> cell <b>protein</b> profiles {{showed that}} members of the rRNA group II pseudomonads were distinct from other non‐fluorescent and fluorescent pseudomonads, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the type species of the genus Pseudomonas. Strains of Ps. andropogonis, Ps. caryophylli, Ps. gladioli pv. gladioli, Ps. pickettii, Ps. pseudomallei and Ps. rubrisubalbicans showed uniform and distinct protein patterns, while strains of Ps. solanacearum and Ps. cepacia displayed differences within species. Numerical analysis <b>of</b> their <b>protein</b> profiles with GelManager and Taxan programs generated dendrograms comprising 16 clusters at 89 % similarity. Each cluster included strains belonging to the same species with the exception of Ps. solanacearum, which fragmented into three clusters. Pseudomonas solanacearum showed different protein patterns correlating with different biovars and the two divisions of Cook et al. (1989), as well as the results of 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> cell <b>protein</b> profiles <b>of</b> a total of 83 strains belonging to 14 bacterial species were numerically analysed.

40|$|Secreted {{proteins}} {{are reported}} to induce cell-mediated immunity characterised by the production of interferon-gamma (IFN) - γ. In this study three open reading frames (ORFs) (Erum 8060, Erum 7760, Erum 5000) encoding secreted proteins were selected from the Ehrlichia ruminantium (Welgevonden) genome sequence using bioinformatics tools {{to determine whether they}} induce a cellular immune response in vitro with mononuclear cells from needle and tick infected animals. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> recombinant <b>protein</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three ORFs as well as four adjacent fragments of the Erum 5000 protein (Erum 5000 A, Erum 5000 B, Erum 5000 C, Erum 5000 D) were successfully expressed in a bacterial expression system which was confirmed by immunoblots using anti-His antibodies and sheep sera. These recombinant proteins were assayed with immune sheep and cattle peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), spleen and lymph node (LN) cells to determine whether they induce recall cellular immune responses in vitro. Significant proliferative responses and IFN- γ production were evident for all recombinant proteins, especially Erum 5000 A, in both ruminant species tested. Thus overlapping peptides spanning Erum 5000 A were synthesised and peptides that induce proliferation of memory CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells and production of IFN- γ were identified. These results illustrate that a Th 1 type immune response was elicited and these recombinant proteins and peptides may therefore be promising candidates for development of a heartwater vaccine. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHasA is a haem-binding protein {{which is}} {{secreted}} under iron-deficiency conditions by the gram-negative bacterium Serratia marcescens. It is a monomer of 19 kDa (187 residues) able to bind free haem {{as well as}} to capture it from haemoglobin. HasA delivers haem to a specific outer-membrane receptor HasR and allows the bacteria to grow {{in the absence of any}} other source of iron. It is secreted by a signal peptide-independent pathway which involves a C-terminal secretion signal and an ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter. The C-terminal region of the secretion signal containing the essential secretion motif is cleaved during or after the secretion process by proteases secreted by the bacteria. In this work, we study by 1 H NMR the conformation of the C-terminal extremity <b>of</b> HasA in <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>protein</b> and that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isolated secretion signal peptide in a zwitterionic micelle complex that mimicks the membrane environment. We identify a helical region followed by a random-coil C-terminus in the peptide-micelle complex and we show that in both <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>protein</b> and <b>the</b> complex, the last 15 residues containing the motif essential for secretion are highly flexible and unstructured. This flexibility may be a prerequisite to the recognition of HasA by its ABC transporter. We determine the cleavage site of the C-terminal extremity <b>of</b> the <b>protein</b> and analyse the effect of the cleavage on the haem acquisition process...|$|R
40|$|The actin {{cytoskeleton}} is {{best known}} for its role during cellular morphogenesis. However, other evidence suggests that actin is also crucial for the organization and dynamics of membrane organelles such as endosomes and the Golgi complex(1 - 3). As in morphogenesis, the Rho family of small GTPases are key mediators of organelle actin-driven events(4, 5), although it is unclear how these ubiquitously distributed proteins are activated to regulate actin dynamics in an organelle-specific manner. Here we show that the brain-specific Rho-binding protein Citron-N- 6 is enriched at, and associates with, the Golgi apparatus of hippocampal neurons in culture. Suppression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>protein</b> or expression <b>of</b> a mutant form lacking the Rho-binding activity results in dispersion of the Golgi apparatus. In contrast, high intracellular levels induce localized accumulation of RhoA and filamentous actin, protecting the Golgi from the rupture normally produced by actin depolymerization. Biochemical and functional analyses indicate that Citron-N controls actin locally by assembling together the Rho effector ROCK-II and the actin-binding, neuron-specific, protein Profilin-IIa (PIIa). Together with recent data on endosomal dynamics(5), our results highlight the importance of organelle-specific Rho modulators for actin-dependent organelle organization and dynamics. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|It has {{generally}} been considered that protein phosphatases have more diverse catalytic domain structures and mechanisms than protein kinases; however, gene annotation efforts following {{the human genome project}} appeared to have completed <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> array <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> phosphatases. Ser/Thr phosphatases are divided into three subfamilies that have different structures from each other, whereas Tyr phosphatases and dual-specificity phosphatases targeting Tyr, Ser and Thr belong to a single large family based on their common structural features. Several years of research have revealed, however, the existence <b>of</b> unexpected <b>proteins,</b> designated here as "atypical protein phosphatases", that have structural and enzymatic features different from those <b>of</b> the known <b>protein</b> phosphatases and are involved in important biological processes. In this review, we focus on the identification and functional characterization <b>of</b> atypical <b>protein</b> phosphatases, represented by eyes absent (EYA), suppressor of T-cell receptor signaling (Sts) and phosphoglycerate mutase family member 5 (PGAM 5) and discuss their biological significance in cellular signaling...|$|R
40|$|Background: Elucidating {{the role}} of gut {{microbiota}} in physiological and pathological processes has recently emerged as a key research aim in life sciences. In this respect, metaproteomics, <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>protein</b> complement <b>of</b> a microbial community, can provide a unique contribution by revealing which functions are actually being expressed by specific microbial taxa. However, its wide application to gut microbiota research has been hindered by challenges in data analysis, especially related to {{the choice of the}} proper sequence databases for protein identification. Results: Here, we present a systematic investigation of variables concerning database construction and annotation and evaluate their impact on human and mouse gut metaproteomic results. We found that both publicly available and experimental metagenomic databases lead to the identification of unique peptide assortments, suggesting parallel database searches as a mean to gain more complete information. In particular, the contribution of experimental metagenomic databases was revealed to be mandatory when dealing with mouse samples. Moreover, the use of a "merged" database, containing all metagenomic sequences from the population under study, was found to be generally preferable over the use of sample-matched databases. We also observed that taxonomic and functional results are strongly database-dependent, in particular when analyzing the mouse gut microbiota. As a striking example, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio varied up to tenfold depending on the database used. Finally, assembling reads into longer contigs provided significant advantages in terms of functional annotation yields. Conclusions: This study contributes to identify host- and database-specific biases which need {{to be taken into account}} in a metaproteomic experiment, providing meaningful insights on how to design gut microbiota studies and to perform metaproteomic data analysis. In particular, the use of multiple databases and annotation tools has to be encouraged, even though this requires appropriate bioinformatic resources...|$|R
