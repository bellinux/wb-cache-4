5|$|After {{three years}} in development, the game was {{progressing}} slowly, and it was unknown {{when it would be}} finished. Activision set a series of deadlines for the project's development to ensure <b>Troika</b> would have sufficient time to effectively test the game, though these milestones were repeatedly extended, and Bloodlines eventually ran over budget. In 2003 Activision intervened, ordering that the game be ready for release in the next few months, and even advancing more money to <b>Troika</b> to complete its work on The Temple of Elemental Evil for Atari, freeing the <b>Troika</b> team to work on Bloodlines exclusively. Activision eventually issued an ultimatum that the project be finished within months, on September 15, 2004. <b>Troika</b> delivered a version of Bloodlines on the required date; due to its scale, the game underwent three weeks of testing. Activision decided that the game was suitable for release, but was contractually bound to withhold Bloodlines until after the debut of Half-Life 2 in November 2004. <b>Troika</b> convinced Activision to use the delay to fund further development; the additional budget was not enough to pay all of Troika's staff, and some employees worked unpaid to complete the project. This version underwent another three weeks of testing to become the final release code; the game was still unfinished when Activision forced its release. Bloodlines creative director Jason Anderson blamed Activision, saying that the publisher took the game from <b>Troika</b> without providing enough time to test and polish it. During the nearly four years of development, he estimated that the team worked overtime for all but two months.|$|E
5|$|<b>Troika</b> {{wanted to}} make a 3D game, but was {{uncertain}} whether to build a new game engine or license an existing one and whether to use first- or third-person. At that time, the Source game engine was being built by Valve Corporation. Valve employee Scott Lynch approached <b>Troika</b> about using the engine, {{and it was the first}} external team to use it. <b>Troika</b> chose Source for its facial animation and lip-synching system, since it wanted players to speak to the characters face-to-face. Since the engine was in development with Bloodlines and Valve's own Half-Life 2, <b>Troika</b> was working with unfamiliar code and tools, forcing it to write its own code to compensate for the unfinished engine, and with only a single source for technical support. <b>Troika</b> developed a lighting system to create distinctive, moody illumination for the nighttime setting, a particle system for the special effects accompanying the vampire Disciplines, and a cloth system for clothing flow. Source lacked its later artificial intelligence (AI) coding, and Troika's code worked poorly with the Source engine.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after its}} debut, {{most of the}} {{development}} staff were laid off; the remaining staff tried to patch Bloodlines and develop game concepts to secure funding to keep <b>Troika</b> in business. <b>Troika,</b> unable to obtain further funding from Activision or other publishers, released its employees in two waves: the first in November 2004, followed by the remaining staff in December, except for its three founders Anderson, Boyarsky, and Tim Cain. Some employees worked without pay to fix the game. When the company closed in February 2005, it had secured no other game development deals. That month, Boyarsky confirmed that <b>Troika</b> had not {{been working on a}} patch for the game since most of its staff were gone since December 2004. In a November 2004 interview Boyarsky said that although the team would like to pursue a Bloodlines sequel, the decision was Activision's. In a 2006 interview, Anderson said that although <b>Troika</b> Games' library had been critically well received, consistent technical issues had marred the perception of the company's games, contributing to Troika's difficulty in obtaining new projects.|$|E

50|$|Le Marmot's {{first two}} races of 1980 saw him matched against Three <b>Troikas,</b> the filly who had beaten {{him in the}} Arc. On 7 April Le Marmot {{finished}} third behind Three <b>Troikas</b> and Gain in the Prix d'Harcourt over 2000 m at Longchamp. On 4 May Le Marmot faced Three <b>Troikas,</b> Gain, Northern Baby and High Sierra at weight-for-age in the Prix Ganay. Starting at odds of 4.6/1, he overtook Northern Baby early in the straight and won decisively by {{one and a half}} lengths from the 3/10 favourite Three <b>Troikas.</b>|$|R
5000|$|To execute this order, {{numerous}} NKVD <b>troikas</b> {{were created}} on republican and various regional levels (krai and oblast).

5|$|The {{development}} of Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines began at <b>Troika</b> Games in November 2001. The developers {{wanted to put}} a role-playing game in a first-person setting, believing that the genre had become stale. <b>Troika</b> approached publisher Activision with its idea; Activision suggested using the Vampire: The Masquerade license used a year earlier in Nihilistic Software's , which had experienced sufficient success to merit a sequel. Instead of developing a sequel to Redemption, the development team researched the White Wolf property, including the game's rules and its storylines. <b>Troika</b> was a small game studio, with five developers and a total staff of thirty-two (including lead writer Brian Mitsoda, who joined the team {{less than a year}} after development began). Although some preliminary design and levels were completed, much of the work was abandoned or redeveloped.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ride}} was renovated in 1990, a new space theme was given. The {{story of the}} ride was the {{passengers}} had been to deliver cargo from a suborbital factory to a station in Alaska. Large screen projections, simulated lasers, mist, and recordings {{were added to the}} ride. In the queue, guests would go through three rooms including Rocket Recovery, Mission Control and Repair Bay. The original entrance to the ride was located next to <b>Troika.</b> During HalloWeekends, the park would change the entrance of Disaster Transport to under the lift hill, leaving the one next to <b>Troika</b> to be used for the Halloween Haunt. For the 2009 season, the entrance was permanently changed to under the lift hill. When the entrance was changed, the Rocket Recovery and Mission Control rooms were closed, leaving the Repair Bay the only room guests walked through.|$|E
5|$|During {{its first}} week on sale, the Microsoft Windows version of Redemption {{was the third}} best-selling game behind The Sims and Who Wants To Be A Millionaire 2nd Edition. Sales of the Collector's Edition were {{individually}} tracked; it was the fifth best-selling game that same week. Redemption achieved enough success to merit the 2004 release of an indirect sequel, , which was set in the same fictional universe and was developed by <b>Troika</b> Games.|$|E

5|$|Faced by {{the threat}} of a {{sovereign}} default and potential resulting exit of the eurozone, some final attempts were made by the Greek government in May 2015 to settle an agreement with the <b>Troika</b> about some adjusted terms for Greece to comply with in order to activate the transfer of the frozen bailout funds in its current programme. The Eurogroup recently granted a six-month technical extension of its current bailout programme to Greece (now set to expire by the end of June 2015), which means the time window to complete negotiations and subsequently implement the conditional measures to unlock the remaining bailout transfers now is very short. Expectations are that Greece in addition will need a follow-up support programme starting 1 July 2015. The <b>Troika</b> announced the condition for offering Greece (and begin negotiations about) establishment of a follow-up programme would be a prior successful completion of the re-negotiated current programme.|$|E
5|$|From the beginning, the studio's {{goal was}} to be able develop {{multiple}} projects simultaneously, and the decision led the company to expand very quickly. Soon after the development of The Sith Lords began the team expanded to 20 employees. As of July 2004 it had expanded to 27, with 18 from Black Isle, and others from Blizzard Entertainment, Electronic Arts, Taldren, Totally Games, Treyarch, and <b>Troika.</b>|$|E
5|$|Portugal's {{debt was}} in September 2012 {{forecast}} by the <b>Troika</b> to peak at around 124% of GDP in 2014, {{followed by a}} firm downward trajectory after 2014. Previously the <b>Troika</b> had predicted it would peak at 118.5% of GDP in 2013, so the developments {{proved to be a}} bit worse than first anticipated, but the situation was described as fully sustainable and progressing well. As a result, from the slightly worse economic circumstances, the country has been given one more year to reduce the budget deficit to a level below 3% of GDP, moving the target year from 2013 to 2014. The budget deficit for 2012 has been forecast to end at 5%. The recession in the economy is now also projected to last until 2013, with GDP declining 3% in 2012 and 1% in 2013; followed by a return to positive real growth in 2014. Unemployment rate increased to over 17% by end of 2012 but it has since decreased gradually to 10,5% as of November 2016.|$|E

In the following year Timeform awarded her a mark of 127, making her the third best female racehorse in Europe behind Three <b>Troikas</b> (133) and Producer (130). The International Classification for 1979 rated Dunette the second-best three-year-old filly in Europe, nine pounds behind Three <b>Troikas.</b> In 1980 she was rated 122 by Timeform, six pounds behind their top-rated older female Three <b>Troikas.</b> The International Classification rated her the second-best older female in Europe, two pounds behind Three <b>Troikas</b> and level with Kilijaro.|$|R

5|$|<b>Troika</b> used first-person {{perspective}} to immerse the {{player in the}} setting, interacting face-to-face with the characters and seeing their facial reactions to the player. It chose to follow a single-character to aid the immersion, creating the isolation of a vampire unable to trust any other character. This aided the story and compensated for the technical issues of allowing multiple player characters.|$|E
5|$|A {{collective}} {{leadership was}} founded immediately after Khrushchev's ouster, consisting of Brezhnev as First Secretary, Kosygin {{as head of}} government, and Anastas Mikoyan (and later Nikolai Podgorny) as head of state. From the beginning, Suslov was a vocal critic of one-man rule such as that seen under Joseph Stalin and Khrushchev. While he condemned Stalin's one-man rule, he equally criticised the individualistic assertiveness of Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation policy. A strong supporter of democratic centralism, Suslov prevented Brezhnev from taking over Kosygin's post as head of government in 1970. Kirilenko, Brezhnev, and Suslov were members of an unofficial <b>Troika</b> within the Communist Party leadership.|$|E
5|$|Describing {{the choice}} of {{developing}} a game based on the existing White Wolf property over creating their own, Boyarsky said that although an original property lacked the constraints of an existing one, the downside was {{that it had not}} been tested and could be rejected by its potential audience; an existing property was proven. <b>Troika</b> tried to stay {{as close as possible to}} the White Wolf rules, while reducing the number of abilities and disciplines to those relevant to Bloodlines gameplay.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} melody in {{this movement}} (E) {{is taken from}} an old Hussar song, for which Prokofiev provided an optional baritone part. The melody first appears in a slow and somewhat dissonant statement, after which the pace quickens: sleigh bells, rapid pizzicato strings, and piano combine {{to give the impression}} of a fast winter's journey by means of the <b>troika,</b> a traditional Russian three-horse sled. The ride is accompanied at regular intervals by the song theme, which brings the movement to its close with a slow repetition of its final phrase.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, a <b>troika</b> {{of private}} equity firms led by TPG Capital, L.P with {{associates}} Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners agreed to purchase BK from Diageo for , with the sale becoming complete in December of that year. The new owners, through several new CEOs, moved to revitalize and reorganize the company, {{the first major}} move was to rename the BK parent as Burger King Brands. The investment group initially planned to take BK public within the {{two years of the}} acquisition, this was delayed until 2006. On 1 February 2006, Out-going CEO Greg Brenneman announced TPG's plans to turn Burger King into a publicly traded company by issuing an Initial Public Offering (IPO).|$|E
5|$|Released in {{competition}} with Half-Life 2 and several other titles, Bloodlines sold fewer than 80,000 copies during its initial release, which was considered a poor performance. It divided critics at the time; although they praised the game's writing and scale of choice, they criticized its technical flaws. It was <b>Troika</b> Games' last production before its failure in early 2005, when it was unable to secure additional projects. The game has a cult following as a rarely replicated example of gameplay and narrative, and contemporary reception recognised it as a flawed masterpiece. Since its original release in 2004, Bloodlines received post-release support from fans, supplying unofficial fixes and re-adding unused content.|$|E

5|$|The team's {{previous}} experience was with turn-based combat games, and it struggled {{to develop a}} real-time combat system affected by customizable attributes and abilities that provided feedback to the player on how those statistics were affecting the battle. It initially found that by adhering too closely to the White Wolf source material rules for guns, where {{the effectiveness of a}} shot is determined in a contest between the player's skill and the opponent's defense, the firearms seemed broken; the player would not hit where they aimed. <b>Troika</b> found it difficult to mesh the available factors in a real-time setting. Melee combat had to deal with a variety of melee weapons and animations and adjust for melee-on-melee and melee-on-ranged combat.|$|E
5|$|Activision {{introduced}} {{the game in}} May 2003, but in October, Valve experienced a security breach in which hackers stole the source code for Half-Life 2. The breach required new security implementations for the engine, delaying both games; the release of Bloodlines was postponed until early 2005. Until May 2004, <b>Troika</b> and Activision said that the game would feature a multiplayer component and modes including a team of vampires against a team of vampire hunters, {{with the ability to}} upgrade characters between each round. The team was left without a producer by Activision for over a year before David Mullich was assigned to the project. With no producer oversight, Mullich found the game's design incomplete, game levels created and abandoned, and several technical issues, including problems with code for the proposed multiplayer option. The Source multiplayer code was in its infancy, increasing its development time, and the idea was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Following Stalin's death, a {{realignment}} of {{the leadership}} strengthened Molotov's position. Georgy Malenkov, Stalin's successor in the post of Premier, reappointed Molotov as Minister of Foreign Affairs on 5 March 1953. Although Molotov {{was seen as a}} likely successor to Stalin {{in the immediate aftermath of}} his death, he never sought to become leader of the Soviet Union. A <b>Troika</b> was established immediately after Stalin's death, consisting of Malenkov, Beria, and Molotov, but ended when Malenkov and Molotov deceived Beria. Molotov supported the removal and later the execution of Beria on the orders of Khrushchev. The new Party Secretary, Khrushchev, soon emerged as the new leader of the Soviet Union. He presided over a gradual domestic liberalisation and a thaw in foreign policy, as was manifest in a reconciliation with Josip Broz Tito's government in Yugoslavia, which Stalin had expelled from the communist movement. Molotov, an old-guard Stalinist, seemed increasingly out of place in the new environment, but he represented the Soviet Union at the Geneva Conference of 1955.|$|E
