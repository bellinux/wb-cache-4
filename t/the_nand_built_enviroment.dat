40|$|We {{propose a}} new approach, called dynamic program and erase scaling (DPES), for {{improving}} <b>the</b> endurance of <b>NAND</b> flash memory. <b>The</b> DPES approach {{is based on}} our key finding that <b>the</b> <b>NAND</b> endurance is depen-dent on the erase voltage {{as well as the}} number of P/E cycles. Since <b>the</b> <b>NAND</b> endurance has a near-linear de-pendence on the erase voltage, lowering the erase volt-age is an effective way of improving <b>the</b> <b>NAND</b> en-durance. By modifying NAND chips to support mul-tiple write modes with different erase voltages, DPES enables a flash software to exploit the new tradeoff be-tween <b>the</b> <b>NAND</b> endurance and write speed. In this pa-per, we present a novel NAND endurance model which accurately captures the tradeoff relationship between the endurance and write speed under dynamic program and erase scaling. Based on our NAND endurance model, we have implemented the first DPES-aware FTL, called aut-oFTL, which improves <b>the</b> <b>NAND</b> endurance with a neg-ligible degradation in the overall write throughput. Our experimental results using various I/O traces show that autoFTL can improve the maximum number of P/E cy-cles by 45 % over an existing DPES-unaware FTL with less than 0. 2 % decrease in the overall write throughput. ...|$|R

To {{reduce the}} power consumption of matchlines, the matchline partitioning scheme is used. Matchline is partitioned into NOR and NAND type matchline. If NAND (NOR) type TCAM cell is used then NAND (NOR) type matchline is used. NOR type TCAM has feature of high speed and high compare power. NAND type TCAM has low speed and low compare power. <b>The</b> <b>NAND</b> and NOR type matchlines are combined to form the pai-sigma matchlines.
