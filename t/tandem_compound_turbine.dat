30|$|Following {{the steam}} {{production}} at {{high and low}} pressures, all steam gets directed to a steam turbine using separate pipelines. The steam turbine can be a dual admission turbine, a separate turbine, or may {{be made up of}} two separate <b>tandem</b> <b>compound</b> <b>turbines</b> which operate based on the steam inlet pressure. The components of a dual flash power plant {{are similar to those of}} a single flash steam power plant. The mineral content of the water becomes concentrated depending on how the dual flash is designed, hence the resource conditions are of extreme importance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{power plant}} {{consists}} of two units each with a generation capacity of 950 MW. [...] Generating units are equipped with General Electric <b>tandem</b> <b>compound</b> steam <b>turbines</b> and Babcock & Wilcox subcritical boilers. [...] The boiler houses of Intermountain Power Plant are 91.75 m and the flue gas stack is 213.67 m tall. The HVDC Intermountain transmission line runs between Intermountain Power Plant and Adelanto Converter Station in Adelanto, California.|$|R
50|$|These {{arrangements}} include single casing, <b>tandem</b> <b>compound</b> {{and cross}} <b>compound</b> <b>turbines.</b> Single casing units {{are the most}} basic style where a single casing and shaft are coupled to a generator. <b>Tandem</b> <b>compound</b> are used where two or more casings are directly coupled together to drive a single generator. A cross <b>compound</b> <b>turbine</b> arrangement features two or more shafts not in line driving two or more generators that often operate at different speeds. A cross <b>compound</b> <b>turbine</b> is typically used for many large applications. A typical 1930s-1960s naval installation is illustrated below; this shows high- and low-pressure turbines driving a common reduction gear, with a geared cruising turbine on one high-pressure turbine.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Tandem</b> <b>compound</b> {{locomotives}} {{were very}} common in the United States prior to WW1, with some railroads such as the Santa Fe having large numbers in several wheel arrangements.

50|$|The {{first of}} these {{experimental}} engines was delivered by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) in 1902. Its overall design {{was based on the}} CGR’s Schenectady-built 8th Class of the previous year, later the Class 8X on the South African Railways (SAR), but it was built as a <b>tandem</b> <b>compound</b> locomotive.

50|$|Comparative {{tests were}} carried out between the <b>Tandem</b> <b>Compound</b> and a similar simplex locomotive, and showed no economy in fuel consumption. Beatty was {{apparently}} not greatly impressed with the <b>Tandem</b> <b>Compound</b> {{and it was not}} long before he had the compound cylinders removed to convert the locomotive to a simplex engine. Subsequent events showed that no real overall economy is obtainable from compound locomotives under South African conditions when all costs, including those of repairs and maintenance, are taken into account.|$|R

50|$|In {{the first}} few years of the twentieth century, Cape Government Railways (CGR) Chief Locomotive Superintendent H.M. Beatty experimented with various forms of {{compound}} steam locomotives. The second of these experimental locomotives was delivered by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) in 1903. Like CGR no. 804, the first experimental CGR <b>tandem</b> <b>compound</b> locomotive which had been delivered the year before, it was based on the CGR’s Schenectady-built 8th Class of 1901.

50|$|The <b>tandem</b> <b>compound</b> {{locomotive}} {{first appeared}} on the American Erie Railroad in 1867. In a <b>tandem</b> <b>compound</b> engine, each pair of high- and low-pressure cylinders drove a common crosshead, connecting rod and crank. The high-pressure cylinders were bolted onto the fronts of the low-pressure cylinders, which were usually each cast integrally with {{one half of the}} smokebox saddle. The hollow piston valves were mounted on the same valve spindle in a common steam chest, with the high-pressure valves arranged for inside admission and the low-pressure valves for outside admission.|$|R
