40|$|Application-specific {{instruction}} set extensions are {{an effective way}} of improving the performance of processors. Critical computation subgraphs can be accelerated by collapsing them into new instructions that are executed on specialized function units. Collapsing the subgraphs simultaneously reduces the length of computation {{as well as the}} number of intermediate results stored in the register file. The main problem with this approach is that a new processor must be generated for each application domain. While new instructions can be designed automatically, there is a substantial amount of engineering cost incurred to verify and to implement the final custom processor. In this work, we propose a strategy to transparent customization of the core computation capabilities of the processor without changing its {{instruction set}}. A configurable array of function units is added to the baseline processor that enables the acceleration {{of a wide range of}} dataflow subgraphs.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to improve the use of the hardware resources of the trace cache mechanism, reducing the implementation cost with no performance degradation. We achieve that by eliminating the replication of traces between the instruction cache and the trace cache. As we show, the trace cache mechanism is generating a high degree of redundancy between the traces stored in the trace cache and those built by the compiler, already present in the instruction cache. Furthermore, code reordering techniques like the software trace cache arrange the basic blocks in a program so that the fall-through path is the most common, effectively increasing this trace redundancy. We propose selective trace storage to avoid trace redundancy between the trace cache and the instruction cache. A simple modification of <b>the</b> <b>fill</b> <b>unit</b> allows <b>the</b> trace cache to store only those traces containing taken branches, which can nor be obtained in a single cycle from the instruction cache. Our results show that selective trace storage and the software trace cache used on a 32 entry trace cache (2 KB) perform as well as a 2048 entry trace cache (128 KB) without the enhancements. This shows that the cooperation between hardware and software is crucial to improve the performance and reduce the requirements of hardware mechanisms in the fetch engine.

The Ontario Ministry of Transport (MTO) commissioned Western Heritage to undertake rescue archaeological work ahead of the four-lane expansion of Highway 11 / 17 in 2010. Previous archaeological investigations in this region have uncovered evidence of early human occupations, potentially associated with early occupation in the region following the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. 18 samples were submitted to the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC) for OSL dating, from four archaeological sites {{in the vicinity of}} Thunder Bay: Mackenzie, Woodpecker 1 and 2, and Hodder. In February 2012, approval was given for quartz SAR OSL analysis on 3 samples each from Mackenzie and Woodpecker 1. Section drawings were provided with luminescence profiles obtained using portable OSL instrumentation developed at SUERC. All samples were subjected to laboratory preparation of sand-sized quartz, and purity checked by scanning electron microscopy. Dose rates for the bulk sediment were evaluated using analyses of the uranium, thorium and potassium concentrations obtained by high resolution gamma spectrometry coupled with beta dose rate measurement using thick source beta counting, in combination with the in-situ gamma dose measurements. Equivalent doses were determined by OSL from 16 aliquots of quartz per sample using the quartz single-aliquot-regenerative (SAR) procedure. The material exhibited good OSL sensitivity and produced acceptable SAR internal quality control performance. Dose distributions from the aliquots were examined using radial plotting methods. All samples revealed some heterogeneity in their equivalent dose distribution, reflecting the main sediment source in the region i. e. glacial sediments. The profile at the Mackenzie site encompasses the lower and upper fills of a cultural pit feature: two samples were taken from <b>the</b> lower <b>fill,</b> in its basal and upper layers, and a single sample was taken from <b>the</b> upper <b>fill.</b> <b>The</b> lower <b>fill</b> (<b>unit</b> 4) is dated to between 6. 09 ± 0. 41 ka (4080 ± 410 BC) and 5. 77 ± 0. 44 ka (3760 ± 440 BC); and <b>the</b> upper <b>fill</b> (<b>unit</b> 6) from 5. 50 ± 0. 32 ka (3490 ± 320 BC). The profile at the Woodpecker 1 site is taken through a series of alluvial units and palaeosols that occur adjacent to a pit-like feature; the upper units in this succession cap/seal the sediments in the pit-like structure in the profile, thereby providing a terminus ante quem for the age of the pit structure. The sample at c. 50 cm DBS in the sequence of alluvial units, at the top of unit 6 is dated to 7. 51 ± 0. 47 ka (5500 ± 470 BC). The samples taken from the basal and upper layers of unit 3, between 15 and 25 cm DBS in the succession, are dated to 6. 19 ± 0. 45 ka (4180 ± 450 BC) and 2. 91 ± 0. 25 ka (900 ± 250 BC), respectively. The OSL investigations at SUERC have verified that there is sufficient quartz in the sediment for dating purposes and that this quartz has promising behaviour for luminescence dating. Having established the suitability of the quartz SAR OSL method for dating the sediment in profiled sections at Mackenzie and Woodpecker 1, it would now be possible to undertake a further programme of work to date additional units at both sites, and the sequences at Hodder and Woodpecker 2.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Traditionally, the {{reliability}} of retaining walls is achieved {{through the use of}} safety factors or margins and adopting conservative assumption in the process of design, that is, by ascertaining that a mini-mum supply condition will remain adequate under a maximum demand condition. However that is often de-fined on the basis of subjective judgments. Such a traditional design methods are difficult to quantify and lack the logical basis of describing uncertainty. Especially, reinforced walls consider not only soil properties but soil-reinforcement interaction uncertainties. There has been much emphasis recently the use of probabilistic method in the geotechnical engineering. The most effective applications of probabilistic methods are involv-ing relative probabilities of failure or illuminating the effects of uncertainties in the parameter. This thesis de-scribed how probabilistic description of soil parameters and soil-reinforcement interaction parameters were applied to the stability analysis. The first-order, second moment approach was explored and applied to the de-sign of reinforced retaining walls. An example illustrated the relative contribution of uncertainties about dif-ferent parameters to {{the reliability}} of the reinforced retaining walls.

It is 5 – 17 -km wide and 35 -km-long, NNE–SSW-trending, asymmetric basin that was formed under the control of strike-slip and oblique-slip normal faults. The basin contains two different infills that are separated by an angular unconformity: (1) an ancient basin fill consisting of Lower Miocene–Lower Pliocene sequences which accumulated in a fluvio-lacustrine depositional setting, and deformed by NE–SW-trending strike-slip faulting; and (2) a modern basin fill consisting of Plio–Quaternary units that are controlled by synchronous strike-slip and normal faulting. Movement on these faults resulted in deposition of the gently tilted Plio–Pleistocene Görece formation and the recent horizontal alluvium. The Görece formation consists of reddish alluvial fan deposits, while the unconformably overlying recent alluvium is made up of alluvial fan, alluvial plain, and fluvial deposits.

In spite of the identical form of the low-energy effective field theories, we show that the quantum anomalies of the theories play different roles in the two systems. In particular, We find that the chiral anomaly is equivalent to the LSM theorem, whereas there is another anomaly, which is not related to the LSM theorem but is intrinsic to the SPT states. As an application, we extend the conventional LSM theorem to multiple-charge multiple-species problems and construct several exotic symmetric insulators.
