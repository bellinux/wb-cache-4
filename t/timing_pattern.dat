It was found that speech rhythm in L 2 English produced by German learners becomes increasingly stress-timed as acquisition progresses. This development is captured by the tempo-normalized rhythm measures of durational variability. Advanced learners also deliver speech at a faster rate. However, when native speakers have to classify the <b>timing</b> <b>patterns</b> characteristic of L 2 English of German learners at different proficiency levels, they attend to speech rate cues and ignore the differences in speech rhythm...|$|R

The symbol consists of data regions which contain modules set out in a regular array. Large symbols contain several regions.

(Note: The modules may be round or square- no specific shape is defined in the standard. For example, dot-peened cells are generally round.) ...|$|E
50|$|Early seeker systems {{determined}} the {{angle to the}} target through timing of the reception of the signal. This makes them susceptible to jamming by releasing false signals that are so powerful that they are seen even when the seeker reticle is covering the sensor. Early jammers like the AN/ALQ-144 used a heated block of silicon carbide as an IR source, and surround it with a spinning set of lenses that send the image {{as a series of}} spots sweeping around the sky. Modern versions more typically use an infrared laser shining on a rapidly rotating mirror. As the beam paints the seeker it causes a flash of light to appear out of sequence, disrupting the <b>timing</b> <b>pattern</b> used to calculate angle. When successful, IR jammers cause the missile to fly about randomly.|$|E
50|$|Ataxic {{dysarthria}} is {{an acquired}} neurological and sensorimotor speech deficit. It {{is a common}} diagnosis among the clinical spectrum of ataxic disorders. Since regulation of skilled movements is a primary function of the cerebellum, damage to the superior cerebellum and the superior cerebellar peduncle is believed to produce this form of dysarthria in ataxic patients. Growing evidence supports the likelihood of cerebellar involvement specifically affecting speech motor programming and execution pathways, producing the characteristic features associated with ataxic dysarthria. This link to speech motor control can explain the abnormalities in articulation and prosody, which are hallmarks of this disorder. Some of the most consistent abnormalities observed in patients with ataxia dysarthria are alterations of the normal <b>timing</b> <b>pattern,</b> with prolongation of certain segments and a tendency to equalize the duration of syllables when speaking. As {{the severity of the}} dysarthria increases, the patient may also lengthen more segments as well as increase the degree of lengthening of each individual segment.|$|E

5000|$|Data Matrix {{symbols are}} rectangular, usually square {{in shape and}} {{composed}} of square [...] "cells" [...] which represent bits. Depending on the coding used, a [...] "light" [...] cell represents a 0 and a [...] "dark" [...] cell is a 1, or vice versa.

Within these borders are rows and columns of cells encoding information. The finder pattern is used to locate and orient the symbol while the <b>timing</b> <b>pattern</b> provides a count {{of the number of}} rows and columns in the symbol. As more data is encoded in the symbol, the number of cells (rows and columns) increases. Each code is unique.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the relative efficacy of verbal and auditory knowledge of results for promoting learning of a new constrained relative <b>timing</b> <b>pattern.</b> In a series of four experiments we compared the efficiency of verbal knowledge of results to that of auditory knowledge of results. The results of all four experiments revealed that verbal knowledge of result is a very effective source of information to promote learning of a new imposed relative <b>timing</b> <b>pattern.</b> Auditory knowledge of results favoured learning of a new relative <b>timing</b> <b>pattern</b> in a very limited set of circumstances. In the present study, this was only the case when movement velocity remained constant from one segment of the task to the next and if it resulted in an unfamiliar temporal pattern.

We present the initial results of applying this method to quaver beat-timing data from performances of Chopin’s Etude Op. 10, No. 3.

40|$|Daniel Goldberg (2015, this issue) explores {{relations}} between timing variations, grouping structure, and musical {{form in the}} percussive accompaniment of Balkan folk dance music. A chronometric re-analysis {{of one of the}} target article’s two audio samples finds a regular metric <b>timing</b> <b>pattern</b> to consistently underlie the variations Goldberg uncovered. Read together, the target article and this commentary demonstrate the complex interplay of a regular <b>timing</b> <b>pattern</b> with several levels of nuanced variation to be performed with fluency, flexibility, and accuracy. This might appear commonplace, but here it is observed {{in the context of an}} asymmetric rhythmic mode, non-isochronous beat sequence, and asymmetric metric hierarchy. This context evidently does not represent a constraint of any sort in respect to the rhythmic timing performance, which casts doubts on the deep-seated assumption that metric regularity depends on iso-periodicity and vertical symmetry. This assumption is sometimes explicitly and often implicitly taken as universal; this comment suggests that, on the contrary, it might well be culturally biased...|$|E

As such, gait biometrics provide a source of data that ties a visible pattern of motion to an individual.

We begin with a camera viewing a person walking on a treadmill, then extract a phase configuration that describes the <b>timing</b> <b>pattern</b> of motions in the gait. The <b>timing</b> <b>pattern</b> is then converted to a rhythmic percussion pattern that allows one to hear differences and similarities across a population of gaits. We can also hear phase patterns in a gait independent of the actual frequency of the gait. Our approach avoids the inconvenience and cost of traditional motion capture methods.

40|$|Over {{the recent}} years pen-paper {{observational}} assessment scales {{have proven to}} be useful to monitor behaviour and responses of humans and animals. Observational assessment tools are typically applied for subjects who are not able to communicate directly. For example pain assessment on young children or lameness assessment for evaluating horses. For on-site observational assessment however it is hard to record and validate <b>timing</b> <b>patterns</b> of observed events using pen-paper scales. Although timing information is in many cases assumed highly valuable, only (videotaped) laboratory scales are able to benefit from this knowledge. In this paper we digitalize pen-paper assessment scales resulting in new functionalities capable to improve assessment scores. A case study for on-site pain/discomfort assessment on severely demented people is presented. The resulting system is an electronic device with a graphical user interface (GUI) on a touch screen. The device allows easily registering and evaluating complex <b>timing</b> <b>patterns</b> of behaviours and responses, on-site.

Moreover digital information is stored in a database improving administration, providing immediate feedback and allowing applications like: visualisation, statistical analysis and scientific research like data mining. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Low-latency {{anonymous}} {{communication protocols}} in general, {{and the popular}} onion-routing protocol in particular, are broken against simple timing attacks. While {{there have been few}} proposed solutions to this problem when the adversary is active, several padding schemes have been proposed to defend against a passive adversary that just observes <b>timing</b> <b>patterns.</b> Unfortunately active adversaries can break padding schemes by inserting delays and dropping messages. We present a protocol that provides anonymity against an active adversary by using a black-box padding scheme that is effective against a passive adversary. Our protocol reduces, in some sense, providing anonymous communication against active attacks to providing a padding scheme against passive attacks. It uses timestamping to enforce <b>timing</b> <b>patterns</b> and redundancy to deal with both malicious and benign delays. Because of an asymmetry between sending data to a destination and receiving data from a destination, the protocol uses different techniques in each direction. Our analytical results show that anonymity can be made arbitrarily good at the cost of some added latency and required bandwidth. We also perform measurements on the Tor network to estimate the real-world performance of our protocol, showing that the added delay is not excessive...|$|R
