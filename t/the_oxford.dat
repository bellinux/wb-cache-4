5|$|Despite {{cash from}} Rothschild, {{the company could}} not raise {{sufficient}} investment to begin construction of <b>the</b> <b>Oxford</b> extension, and had only been given a five-year window by Parliament in which to build it. On 7 August 1888, {{less than two weeks}} before the authorisation was to expire, the directors of <b>the</b> <b>Oxford,</b> Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company received Royal Assent for a revised and cheaper version. To be called <b>the</b> <b>Oxford</b> & Aylesbury Tramroad (O), the new scheme envisaged the extension's being built to the same light specifications as the existing tramway. To avoid expensive earthworks and tunnelling, the line would parallel a road out of Brill, despite the considerable gradients involved. The entire route would be single track, other than passing places, and <b>the</b> <b>Oxford</b> terminus was to be in George Street, nearer the edge of the city.

5|$|Beyond the OULC, Thorpe {{achieved}} {{the presidency of}} <b>the</b> <b>Oxford</b> University Law Society, although his principal objective was the presidency of <b>the</b> <b>Oxford</b> Union, an office frequently used as a stepping-stone to national prominence. Normally, would-be presidents first served in the Union's junior offices, as Secretary, Treasurer or Librarian, but Thorpe, having impressed as a confident and forceful debater, decided early in 1950 to try directly for the presidency. He was easily defeated by the future broadcaster Robin Day. His single-minded pursuit of office, and the dubious strategies he sometimes employed, led to some acrimonious campaigns, but he gained many supporters, and later in 1950 beat two formidable contenders—the socialist Dick Taverne and the Conservative William Rees-Mogg—to secure the presidency for the Hilary term of 1951.|$|E
