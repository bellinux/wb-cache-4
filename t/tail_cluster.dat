50|$|The ABCA {{subfamily}} {{is composed}} of 12 full transporters split into two subgroups. The first subgroup consists of seven genes that map to six different chromosomes. These are ABCA1, ABCA2, ABCA3, and ABCA4, ABCA7, ABCA12, and ABCA13. The other subgroup consists of ABCA5 and ABCA6 and ABCA8, ABCA9 and ABCA10. A8-10.All of subgroup 2 is organized into a head to <b>tail</b> <b>cluster</b> of chromosomes on chromosome 17q24. Genes in this second subgroup are distinguished from ABCA1-like genes by having 37-38 exons {{as opposed to the}} 50 exons in ABCA1. The ABCA1 subgroup is implicated in the development of genetic diseases. In the recessive Tangier’s disease, the ABCA1 protein is mutated. Also, the ABCA4 maps to a region of chromosome 1p21 that contains the gene for Stargardt’s disease. This gene is found to be highly expressed in rod photoreceptors and is mutated in Stargardt’s disease, recessive retinitis pigmentism, and the majority of recessive cone-rod dystrophy.|$|E
40|$|Particle therapy (PT) {{has shown}} {{positive}} therapeutic results in local control of locally advanced pancreatic lesions. PT effectiveness is highly influenced by target localization accuracy both in space, since the pancreas {{is located in}} proximity to radiosensitive vital organs, and in time as it is subject to substantial breathing-related motion. The purpose of this preliminary study was to quantify pancreas range of motion under typical PT treatment conditions. Three common immobilization devices (vacuum cushion, thermoplastic mask, and compressor belt) were evaluated on five male patients in prone and supine positions. Retrospective four-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging data were reconstructed for each condition and the pancreas was manually segmented on each of six breathing phases. A k-means algorithm was then applied on the manually segmented map {{in order to obtain}} clusters representative of the three pancreas segments: head, body, and tail. Centers of mass (COM) for the pancreas and its segments were computed, as well as their displacements with respect to a reference breathing phase (beginning exhalation). The median three-dimensional COM displacements were in the range of 3 mm. Latero-lateral and superior-inferior directions had a higher range of motion than the anterior-posterior direction. Motion analysis of the pancreas segments showed slightly lower COM displacements for the head cluster compared to the <b>tail</b> <b>cluster,</b> especially in prone position. Statistically significant differences were found within patients among the investigated setups. Hence a patient-specific approach, rather than a general strategy, is suggested to define the optimal treatment setup in the frame of a millimeter positioning accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Src {{tyrosine}} kinases transmit integrin-dependent signals pivotal for cell {{movement and}} proliferation. Here, we establish {{a mechanism for}} Src activation by integrins. c-Src is shown to bind constitutively and selectively to β 3 integrins through an interaction involving the c-Src SH 3 domain and the carboxyl-terminal region of the β 3 cytoplasmic <b>tail.</b> <b>Clustering</b> of β 3 integrins in vivo activates c-Src and induces phosphorylation of Tyr- 418 in the c-Src activation loop, a reaction essential for adhesion-dependent phosphorylation of Syk, a c-Src substrate. Unlike c-Src, Hck, Lyn, and c-Yes bind more generally to β 1 A, β 2, and β 3 cytoplasmic tails. These results invoke a model whereby Src is primed for activation by direct interaction with an integrin β <b>tail,</b> and integrin <b>clustering</b> stabilizes activated Src by inducing intermolecular autophosphorylation. The data provide a paradigm for integrin regulation of Src and a molecular basis for the similar functional defects of osteoclasts or platelets from mice lacking β 3 integrins or c-Src...|$|R

5000|$|Angluin {{considers}} so-called [...] "k-reversible" [...] regular automata, that is, deterministic automata {{in which}} each state can be reached from at most one state by following a transition chain of length k.Formally, if Σ, Q, and δ denote the input alphabet, the state set, and the transition function of an automaton A, respectively, then A is called k-reversible if : ∀a0,...,ak ∈ Σ ∀s1, s2 ∈ Q: δ*(s1,a0...ak) = δ*(s2,a0...ak) ⇒ s1 = s2, where δ* means the homomorphic extension of δ to arbitrary words.Angluin gives a cubic algorithm for learning of the smallest k-reversible language from a given set of input words; for k=0, the algorithm has even almost linear complexity.The required state uniqueness after k+1 given symbols forces unifying automaton states, thus leading to a proper generalization different from the trivial undergeneralized automaton.

40|$|NMDA {{receptor}} NR 2 A/B subunits have PDZ-binding domains {{on their}} extreme C-termini {{that are known}} {{to interact with the}} PSD- 95 family and other PDZ proteins. We explore the interactions between PSD- 95 family proteins and the NR 2 A/B cytoplasmic tails, and the consequences of these interactions, from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through delivery to the synapse in primary rat hippocampal and cortical cultured neurons. We find that the NR 2 A/B cytoplasmic <b>tails</b> <b>cluster</b> very early in the secretory pathway and interact serially with SAP 102 beginning at the intermediate compartment, and then PSD- 95. We further establish that colocalization of the distal C-terminus of NR 2 B and PSD- 95 begins at the trans-Golgi Network (TGN). Formation of NR 2 B/PSD- 95 /SAP 102 complexes is dependent on the PDZ binding domain of NR 2 B subunits, but association with SAP 102 and PSD- 95 plays no distinguishable role in cluster pre-formation or initial targeting to the vicinity of the synapse. Instead the PDZ binding domain plays a role in restricting cell-surface clusters to postsynaptic targets...|$|R
40|$|Reverse-micelles are {{surfactant}} aggregates in an apolar solvent. The surfactants, {{which must}} have two hydrophobic <b>tails,</b> <b>cluster</b> around a water core. The effects of the compositions of the solvent and the aqueous phase on water solubilization were studied for two anionic surfactants: sodium di- 2 -ethylhexylsulfosuccinate (AOT) and dinonylnaphthalene sulfonic acid (DNNSA). Single straight chain alkanes having 6 - 17 carbons, mixtures of these alkanes and branched alkanes were used as solvents. The aqueous phases consisted of salts and buffers. For AOT in straight chain alkanes, water uptake increased as {{the length of the}} chain approached 9 carbons, the length of the AOT hydrocarbon tail. As the solvent length increased further, a critical carbon number was reached above which there was no water uptake. Different buffers shifted the critical carbon number somewhat. Mixtures of straight chain alkanes behaved similar to single alkanes when compared on the basis of volume-average carbon number. Branched alkanes solubilized more water than their straight chain isomers. For DNNSA the water uptake was the same for all solvents...|$|R

We show that the immediate cause of the increase in extreme risks in our model is the risk control policy of the banks: A prudent bank makes itself locally safer by putting a limit to leverage, so when a fund exceeds its leverage limit, it must partially repay its loan by selling the asset. Unfortunately this sometimes happens to all the funds simultaneously when the price is already falling. The resulting nonlinear feedback amplies downward price movements. At the extreme this causes crashes, but the eect is seen at every time scale, producing a power law of price disturbances. A standard (supposedly more sophisticated) risk control policy by individual banks makes these extreme uctuations even worse.
