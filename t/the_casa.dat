5|$|Several of Gaudí's {{works have}} been granted World Heritage status by UNESCO: in 1984 the Park Güell, the Palau Güell and <b>the</b> <b>Casa</b> Milà; and in 2005 the Nativity facade, the crypt and the apse of the Sagrada Família, <b>the</b> <b>Casa</b> Vicens and <b>the</b> <b>Casa</b> Batlló in Barcelona, {{together}} with the crypt of the Colònia Güell in Santa Coloma de Cervelló.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the century, Gaudí was working on numerous projects simultaneously. They reflected his shift to a more personal style inspired by nature. In 1900, he received an award for the best building of the year from the Barcelona City Council for his Casa Calvet. During {{the first decade of the}} century Gaudí dedicated himself to projects like <b>the</b> <b>Casa</b> Figueras (Figueras house, better known as Bellesguard), the Park Güell, an unsuccessful urbanisation project, and the restoration of the Cathedral of Palma de Mallorca, for which he visited Majorca several times. Between 1904 and 1910 he constructed <b>the</b> <b>Casa</b> Batlló (Batlló house) and <b>the</b> <b>Casa</b> Milà (Milá house), two of his most emblematic works.|$|E
5|$|His {{body was}} flown to <b>the</b> <b>Casa</b> Rosada {{for a state}} funeral, and three {{national}} days of mourning were declared. Kirchner's funeral was attended by thousands, despite heavy rain. According to media reports, 1,000 people per hour entered <b>the</b> <b>Casa</b> Rosada in groups of 100 to 150. Cristina Kirchner, dressed in mourning, {{stood next to the}} coffin. People brought candles, flags and flowers, some of which Cristina accepted personally.|$|E

5|$|Parker's {{finished}} script included 146 {{changes to}} the concept album's music and lyrics. In May 1995, he and Rice visited Lloyd Webber {{at his home in}} France, where Parker tried to bring them to work on the film. Rice and Lloyd Webber had not worked together for many years, and the script for Evita required that they compose new music. In June 1995, with assistance from the United States Department of State and senator Chris Dodd, Parker arranged a private meeting with Menem in Argentina to discuss the film's production and request permission to film at <b>the</b> <b>Casa</b> Rosada, the executive mansion. Although he expressed his discontent with the production, Menem granted the filmmakers creative freedom to shoot in Argentina, but not in <b>the</b> <b>Casa</b> Rosada. He also advised Parker to be prepared to face protests against the film. Parker had the film's production designer Brian Morris take photographs of <b>the</b> <b>Casa</b> Rosada, so that the production could construct a replica at Shepperton Studios in England. The director visited seven other countries before deciding to film on location in Buenos Aires and Budapest.|$|E

5|$|A {{virtually}} unknown work by Gaudí is <b>the</b> <b>Casa</b> Clapés (1899–1900), at 125 Carrer Escorial, {{commissioned by the}} painter Aleix Clapés, who collaborated on occasion with Gaudí, such as in decorating the Palau Güell and <b>the</b> <b>Casa</b> Milà. It has a ground floor and three apartments, with stuccoed walls and cast-iron balconies. Due to its lack of decoration or original structural solutions its authorship was unknown until 1976, when the architect's signed plans by Gaudí were discovered. In 1900, he renovated the house of Dr. Pere Santaló, at 32 Carrer Nou de la Rambla, a work of equally low importance. Santaló {{was a friend of}} Gaudí's, whom he accompanied during his stay in Puigcerdà in 1911.It was he who recommended him to do manual work for his rheumatism.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{being one}} of the oldest {{surviving}} examples of Spanish architecture in California, the house gained much prominence by association with Helen Hunt Jackson's wildly popular 1884 novel Ramona. <b>The</b> <b>Casa</b> de Estudillo is one of three National Historic Landmarks in Southern California that were closely tied to Ramona, a novel of Californio life shortly after the American acquisition of California; the other two are Rancho Camulos and Rancho Guajome.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{professional}} life was distinctive {{in that he}} never ceased to investigate mechanical building structures. Early on, Gaudí was inspired by oriental arts (India, Persia, Japan) through {{the study of the}} historicist architectural theoreticians, such as Walter Pater, John Ruskin and William Morris. The influence of the Oriental movement can be seen in works like the Capricho, the Güell Palace, the Güell Pavilions and <b>the</b> <b>Casa</b> Vicens. Later on, he adhered to the neo-Gothic movement that was in fashion at the time, following the ideas of the French architect Viollet-le-Duc. This influence is reflected in the Teresian College, the Episcopal Palace in Astorga, <b>the</b> <b>Casa</b> Botines and the Bellesguard house {{as well as in the}} crypt and the apse of the Sagrada Família. Eventually, Gaudí embarked on a more personal phase, with the organic style inspired by nature in which he would build his major works.|$|E

5|$|In 1904, {{commissioned}} by the painter Lluís Graner, he designed the decoration of the Sala Mercè, in the Rambla dels Estudis, {{one of the first}} cinemas in Barcelona; the theatre imitated a cave, inspired by the Coves del Drac (Dragon's Caves) in Mallorca. Also for Graner he designed a detached house in the Bonanova district of Barcelona, of which only the foundations and the main gate were built, with three openings: for people, vehicles and birds; the building would have had a structure similar to <b>the</b> <b>Casa</b> Batlló or the porter's lodge of the Park Güell.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Alfonsín {{supported}} a {{faction of the}} UCR that favoured the idea of carrying an independent candidate for the 2007 presidential elections. The UCR, instead of fielding its own candidate, endorsed Roberto Lavagna, a center-left economist {{who presided over the}} dramatic recovery in the Argentine economy from 2002 until he parted ways with President Néstor Kirchner in December 2005. Unable to sway enough disaffected Kirchner supporters, Lavagna garnered third place. Alfonsín was honoured by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner with a bust of his likeness at <b>the</b> <b>Casa</b> Rosada on October 1, 2008. This was his last public appearance.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days, Menem sported an image {{similar to the}} old caudillos, such as Facundo Quiroga and Chacho Peñaloza. He groomed his sideburns in a similar style.

The ceremony was attended by the provincial governors, Supreme Court president Julio Nazareno, the heads of the armed forces, and Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Raúl Alfonsín was the only former president in attendance. Kirchner walked to <b>the</b> <b>Casa</b> Rosada along Avenida de Mayo, breaking with protocol to get close to the people, and was accidentally hit {{in the head with a}} camera.|$|E
