500|$|Upon release, Strange Days {{polarized}} film critics. Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars and described it as [...] "a <b>technical</b> <b>tour</b> de force... The pacing is relentless, and the editing, by Howard Smith, creates an urgency and desperation". He also highlighted the film's astute use of SQUID technology, stating that [...] "Bigelow is able to exploit the idea of what is happening; she forces her audience {{to deal with the}} screen reality, instead of allowing us to process it as routine 'action.'" [...] In a mixed review, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B-" [...] rating, concluding that Strange Days [...] "has a dazzling atmosphere of grunge futurism, but beneath its dark satire of audiovisual decadence lurks a naggingly conventional underworld thriller." [...] Edward Guthmann of San Francisco Chronicle criticized the film for failing to commentate its violence, saying that [...] "Bigelow's style is so visceral [...] that her movie reminds us of a snuff film, rather than a well-reasoned cautionary tale about our animal instincts." [...] New York magazine writer David Denby stated similar cons and called the rape scene [...] "the sickest sequence in modern movies".|$|E

In a 2003 retrospective, Game Informer described the game as [...] "decent, but unmemorable", while GamesRadar included Sonic R in a 2014 list of the top 50 Sega Saturn games, calling it [...] "a <b>technical</b> <b>tour</b> de force". GameTrailers ranked it as the second worst Sonic game, behind 2006's Sonic the Hedgehog. Game designer Hirokazu Yasuhara, who helped Traveller's Tales rework the game in response to concerns over the quality of a preview version, has maintained that [...] "the final version of Sonic R is actually quite good... However, I do admit that the base concept of Sonic R, in which a player 'drives' running characters, is not great".|$|E

50|$|An {{occasionally}} brilliant painter Nerli brought {{something of}} the new influences emerging in Europe to the Australasian art scene, helping to shift the direction of Australian and New Zealand art. In Charles Conder and Frances Hodgkins he influenced those countries' most notable expatriates. A few of his works have secured him a lasting place in Australia's and New Zealand's art histories. The Sitting (1889) is worthy of Tissot and Nerli's lost work, The Ascension (c.1887) was a <b>technical</b> <b>tour</b> de force anticipating aspects of 20th-century art. His landscapes of the Heidelberg period, Beach Scene, Black Rock and Fitzroy Gardens (both c. 1889) show him combining the new objectivity which superseded romantic landscape with a lyricism worthy of the French Impressionists. However, his greatest achievements are a few penetrating portraits, that of Robert Louis Stevenson already mentioned, his Portrait of Dr. D.M. Stuart (1894), Portrait of W.M. Hodgkins (1893) in the Hocken Collections Dunedin, and his Portrait of a Young Woman Artist (c.1889), also in the Hocken. These works capture elusive psychological states, Stevenson's illness and Stuart's nearness to death. Nerli's Portrait of a Girl (1894?) {{in the collection of}} the Dunedin Public Art Gallery is a minor masterpiece, brilliantly evoking the ambivalence of adolescence.|$|E

Currently non-dairy additives are added to impede emulsion instabilities, but manufacturers are looking for their removal (clean label tendency). WP microgels are highly stable to heating 1. They were suggested to be more efficient than native WP to stabilize emulsions over time 2, but the heat stability of such emulsions is not addressed yet. Fractal aggregates are responsible for emulsion flocculation and coalescence when they cover fat droplet surface 3. Emulsion instability is reduced in the presence of small amount of caseins. We hypothesized {{that it is possible to}} design WP emulsions that are stable to heating in a large range of protein concentrations by covering fat droplet surface with caseins and releasing WP microgels in the aqueous phase. Dairy emulsions at 30 % fat content and containing between 2. 5 % to 6. 5 % (w/w in the aqueous phase) WP microgels, and 0 to 0. 4 % (w/w in the aqueous phase) caseins were reconstituted. The protein interfacial amount and composition were determined immediately after emulsion formation and the heat-stability of the emulsions at 120 °C was assessed at macroscopic and microscopic scale. At low casein concentration in the emulsion the fat droplet surface was mainly covered by WP microgels and the emulsions gelled rapidly on heating. Emulsions were heat-stable at 0. 4 % casein concentration whatever the WP microgel concentration in the aqueous phase. This study shows that it is possible to produce WP emulsions that are stable to heat treatment in the absence of additives by a reasoned approach: the selection of the casein concentration in order to cover fat droplet surface and the selection of WP aggregates (microgels), that are heat-stable in solution...|$|R

Their main functions are to supply dietary energy and bioactive molecules in the gastro-intestinal of newborns. Milk fat globules are also consumed by human infants and adults in various dairy products, despite they can be altered by dairy processes. MPL have a specific composition as compared to polar lipids from other dietary sources (e. g. soya lecithin). They are a unique source of glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids, mainly sphingomyelin (SM). Milk-SM contains long-chain saturated fatty acids and has the specificity to change its physical state as a function of temperature. Milk-SM has also been reported to have specific interactions with cholesterol and to form lipid domains, as revealed in the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM). The chemical composition, biophysical properties and structural organization of MPL have raised attention for the last years to better understand the specific functions provided by the MFGM. Technological processes used in the dairy industry can disrupt milk fat globules and alter the MFGM. Also, processed lipid droplets neo-formed by homogenization, e. g. in infant milk formulas, are not covered by the MFGM. The questions are: In absence of MFGM or MPL, do we lose something important tailored by Nature for mammal newborns growth and health? Is it possible to mimick milk fat globules by tailoring the composition and structure of processed lipid droplets surface? What are the opportunities for adding MFGM components in dairy products? MPL and MFGM fragments can be concentrated from by-products of the dairy industry (e. g. buttermilk, butterserum). MPL-rich and MFGM-rich ingredients can be added in various dairy products for their capacity to stabilize emulsions and for the increased scientific data supporting their nutritional and health interests. They will undoubtedly be further valorized in a near future (e. g. in dairy products and infant milk formulas) ...|$|R

The current atlas is a fantastic step toward achiev-ing that goal – Timothy O’Leary & Eve Marder [2] write that it will “usher in a new era of integrated methods for deciphering how an entire nervous system generates behavior” and that it has “achieved a <b>technical,</b> multidisciplinary <b>tour</b> de force that will provide a rich source of research questions ” – but it needs to be refined to single neuron resolution. Marta Zlatic and Jim Truman at Janelia Farm have refined the library of neuronal lines used in the current publication, driving expression in a single cell pair in the larval ner-vous system. Optogenetically activation of this new collection will allow the application of multiscale unsupervised structure learning to the behavior data and yield a single neuron behavior map covering all neuron types in the larval nervous system. In parallel, Albert Cardona at Janelia Farm is using electron microscopy (EM) to map a wiring diagram of th...|$|R
