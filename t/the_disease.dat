5|$|Chronic wasting disease, {{transmitted}} by a misfolded protein {{known as a}} prion, affects the brain tissue in elk, and has been detected throughout their range in North America. First documented in the late 1960s in mule deer, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> has affected elk on game farms and in the wild {{in a number of}} regions. Elk that have contracted <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> begin to show weight loss, increased watering needs, disorientation and listlessness, and at an advanced stage <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> leads to death. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> is similar to but not the same as mad cow disease, and no risks to humans have been documented, nor has <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> been demonstrated to pose a threat to domesticated cattle. In 2002, South Korea banned the importation of elk antler velvet due to concerns about chronic wasting disease.|$|E

The average onset of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> is around age 40, and two-thirds of those affected are non-smokers, although smoking is not believed to be a cause.

5|$|Genetic {{predisposition}} for DPB susceptibility {{has been}} localized to two HLA haplotypes (a nucleotide or gene sequence difference between paired chromosomes, {{that is more}} likely to occur among a common ethnicity or trait) common to people of East Asian descent. HLA-B54 is associated with DPB in the Japanese, while HLA-A11 is associated with <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> in Koreans. Several genes within this region of class I HLA are believed to be responsible for DPB, by allowing increased susceptibility to <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> The common genetic background and similarities in the HLA profile of affected Japanese and Korean individuals were considered in the search for a DPB gene. It was suggested that a mutation of a suspected disease-susceptibility gene located somewhere between HLA-B and HLA-A had occurred on an ancestral chromosome carrying both HLA-B54 and HLA-A11. Further, it is possible that a number of genetic recombination events around <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> locus (location on a chromosome) could have resulted in <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> being associated with HLA-B54 in the Japanese and HLA-A11 in Koreans. After further study, it was concluded that a DPB susceptibility gene is located near the HLA-B locus at chromosome 6p21.3. Within this area, the search for a genetic cause of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> has continued.|$|E
