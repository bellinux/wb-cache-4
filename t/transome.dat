60|$|<b>Transome</b> Kent, however, {{was not a}} man to be {{baffled by}} initial defeat.|$|E
60|$|But <b>Transome</b> Kent was {{no longer}} listening. He had seized {{the edge of the}} billiard table.|$|E
60|$|The Chief Inspector of the Detective Department, a large, heavy-looking man, was {{standing}} beside a gate-post. He nodded gloomily to <b>Transome</b> Kent.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] he declared, [...] "but the {{frontispiece}} of {{the catalogue}} {{is certainly a}} little misleading. To tell you the truth, sir, {{there are very few}} articles here from Dr. <b>Transome's</b> house at all. The bulk of his effects were distributed among relatives. What {{we have here is a}} portion of the kitchen and servant's bedroom furniture." ...|$|R
50|$|The general {{character}} of the original structure was distinguished by long windows divided into numerous lights by massive mullions and <b>transomes.</b> An apartment on the principal storey contained a pointed arched fireplace, enriched panelling of oak, and a bay window, together with its size, being larger than the other apartments, would prove this {{to have been the}} grand room of the house. Heavy beams of chestnut crossed the ceiling, supported by a slender pillar at the intersection. Some apartments, south of this principal room, had been disused for many years, the windows being partly blocked up. The low pointed arched doorway was about two feet six inches in width.|$|R
5000|$|The Tudor Tavern, {{also known}} as [...] "Ancient House" [...] is located at 15 Fore Street, Taunton. It is a three-storey timbered house with a forward jutting first and second floor. The front is carved with the {{initials}} T.T. and I.T. and the year 1578. The high, steep roof is clad with red tiles, the upper part overhanging the 8-light oriel window on the second floor. The first floor has a nine-light oriel window with further lights on either side making 17 lights altogether. Each of these windows has leaded lights with <b>transomes</b> and mullions. The interior of the house has been largely restored but the medieval hall with its trussed roof and arched braces survives.|$|R
6000|$|... "Kent," [...] he continued, [...] "from {{the first}} moment of your mock investigation, I knew who you were. Your every step was shadowed, your every {{movement}} dogged. <b>Transome</b> Kent--by your true name, Peter Kelly, murderer, I denounce you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{a little}} puzzled, sir," [...] the old gentleman said, confidentially, [...] "about the {{absolute}} authenticity of this chippendale suite--lot number 101 in the catalogue. This sale is--er--um--advertised as being--" [...] the old gentleman turned over {{the pages of the}} catalogue quickly--"a sale {{of the effects of the}} late Doctor <b>Transome.</b> That's so, eh?" ...|$|E
60|$|But it {{was soon}} clear that <b>Transome</b> Kent had {{something}} else in mind than to win the game. Presently his opportunity came. With a masterly stroke, such as few trained players could use, he had potted his adversary's ball. The red ball was left over the very jaws of the pocket. The white was in the centre.|$|E
25|$|This {{one story}} {{building}} {{is a very good}} example of Neoclassic style in Ponce and the only one single-story building in the area. It preserves its simple lines typical of the 19th century institutional or military construction in the Island. Contributing elements to the style are its massive and sober exterior elements consisting of wide walls and pilasters crowned with tuscan order capitols, planar window surrounds, and a set of steps giving access to the main portico which projects form the main facade. A simple cornice crowns the building in all facades. Series of arched windows originally closed by wood louvers and glass panel <b>transomes,</b> complete the facade (these windows were replaced with metal blinds in the mid-1960s and have been vandalized in recent years).|$|R
6000|$|Her {{style is}} {{influenced}} by her purpose—may be said, indeed, to be created by it. The excellences and the blemishes of the diction come of the end sought to be attained by it. Its subtleties and obscurities were equally inevitable. Analytical thinking takes on an analytical phraseology. It is a striking instance of a mental habit creating a vocabulary. The method of thought produces the form of rhetoric. Some of the sentences are mental landscapes. The meaning {{seems to be in}} motion on the page. It is elusive from its very subtlety. It is more our analyst than her character of Rufus Lyon, who “would fain find language subtle enough to follow the utmost intricacies of the soul’s pathways.” Mrs. <b>Transome’s</b> “lancet-edged epigrams” are dull in comparison with her own. She uses them with startling success in dissecting motive and analyzing feeling. They deserve as great renown as “Nélaton’s probe.” ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the little}} wood {{opposite}} the light {{they stood in}} blackish spreads or sheddings like spots on a snake. The heads are then like thongs and solemn in grain and grape-colour. But in the clough through the light they come in falls of sky-colour washing the brows and slacks of the ground with vein-blue, thickening at the double, vertical themselves and the young grass and brake-fern combed vertical, but the brake struck the upright of all this with winged <b>transomes.</b> It was a lovely sight. - The bluebells in your hand baffle you with their inscape, made to every sense. If you draw your fingers through them they are lodged and struggle with a shock of wet heads; the long stalks rub and click and flatten to a fan on one another like your fingers themselves would when you passed the palms hard across one another, making a brittle rub and jostle like the noise of a hurdle strained by leaning against; {{then there is the}} faint honey smell and in the mouth the sweet gum when you bite them.|$|R
60|$|A {{few days}} after the events last narrated, <b>Transome</b> Kent called at the boarding-house of Miss Alice Delary. The young Investigator wore a light grey tweed suit, with a salmon-coloured {{geranium}} in his buttonhole. There was something exultant {{yet at the same time}} grave in his expression, as of one who has taken a momentous decision, affecting his future life.|$|E
6000|$|Within a {{few minutes}} <b>Transome</b> Kent had leapt into a car (a surface car) and was {{speeding}} north towards Riverside Drive with the full power of the car. As he passed uptown a newsboy was already calling, [...] "Club Man Murdered! Another Club Man Murdered!" [...] Carelessly throwing a cent to the boy, Kent purchased a paper and read the brief notice of the tragedy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hullo, operator! Put {{me through}} to two, two, two, two, two. Is that two, two, two, two, two? Hullo, two, two, two, two, two; I want <b>Transome</b> Kent. Kent speaking? Kent, this is Throgton speaking. Kent, a murder has been {{committed}} at the Kelly residence, Riverside Drive. I {{want you to go}} and cover it. Get it all. Don't spare expense. The Planet is behind you. Have you got car-fare? Right." ...|$|E
6000|$|The double {{recollection}} of an English traveller, {{whom he had}} received the week before at court, and of an old English rogue called <b>Transome,</b> whom he had known in youth, came pertinently to the Prince’s help. ‘Transome,’ he answered, ‘is my name. I am an English traveller. It is, to-day, Tuesday. On Thursday, before noon, the money shall be ready. Let us meet, if you please, in Mittwalden, at the “Morning Star.”’ ...|$|E
6000|$|Meantime <b>Transome</b> Kent {{was on the}} trail. Sleepless, almost foodless, and {{absolutely}} drinkless, he was everywhere. He was looking for Peter Kelly. Wherever crowds were gathered, the Investigator was there, searching for Kelly. In the great concourse of the Grand Central Station, Kent moved to and fro, peering into everybody's face. An official touched him on the shoulder. [...] "Stop peering into the people's faces," [...] he said. [...] "I am unravelling a mystery," [...] Kent answered. [...] "I beg your pardon, sir," [...] said the man, [...] "I didn't know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] {{the little}} old gentleman continued. [...] "Now I knew Dr. <b>Transome</b> intimately, and he was, without the {{slightest}} doubt, a rare judge of old furniture. I wouldn't mind following him anywhere, or accepting his judgment about anything. He was very set upon not having anything in his house that was not genuine. Now under any other circumstances, mind you, I should have had my doubts about that suite, {{but if you can}} assure me that it came from Dr. Transome's house, why, there's no more to be said about it. I'm a bidder." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Transome</b> Kent {{was not a}} detective. He was a reporter. After {{sweeping}} {{everything at}} Harvard in front of him, and then behind him, he had joined {{the staff of the}} Planet two months before. His rise had been phenomenal. In his first week of work he had unravelled a mystery, in his second he had unearthed a packing scandal which had poisoned the food of the entire nation for ten years, and in his third he had pitilessly exposed some of the best and most respectable people in the metropolis. Kent's work on the Planet consisted now almost exclusively of unravelling and unearthing, and it was natural that the manager should turn to him.|$|E
60|$|But {{if this is}} a great mind {{fascinated with}} the {{insoluble}} enigma of human motives, it is a mind profoundly in sympathy with those who are puzzling hopelessly over the riddle or are struggling hopelessly in its toils. She is “on a level and in the press with them as they struggle their way along the stony road through the crowd of unloving fellow-men.” She says “the only true knowledge of our fellows is that which enables us to feel with them, which gives us a finer ear for the heart-pulses that are beating under the mere clothes of circumstance and opinion.” No artist in fiction ever had a finer ear or a more human sympathy for the straggler who “pushes manfully on” and “falls at last,” leaving “the crowd to close over the space he has left.” Her extraordinary skill in disclosing “the peculiar combination of outward with inward facts which constitute a man’s critical actions,” only makes her the more charitable in judging them. “Until we know what this combination has been, or will be, it will be better not to think ourselves wise about” the character that results. “There is a terrible coercion in our deeds which may first turn the honest man into a deceiver, and then reconcile him to the change. And for this reason the second wrong presents itself to him in the guise of the only practicable right.” There is nothing of the spirit of “served him right,” or “just what she deserved,” or “they ought to have known better,” in George Eliot. That is not in her line. The opposite of that is exactly in her line. This is characteristic of her: “In this world {{there are so many of}} these common, coarse people, who have no picturesque or sentimental wretchedness! And it is so needful we should remember their existence, else we may happen to leave them quite out of our religion and philosophy, and frame lofty theories which only fit a world of extremes.” She does not leave them out. Her books are full of them, and of a Christly charity and plea for them. Who can ever forget little Tiny, “hidden and uncared for as the pulse of anguish in the breast of the bird that has fluttered down to its nest with the long-sought food, and has found the nest torn and empty?” There is nothing in fiction to surpass in pathos the picture of the death of Mrs. Amos Barton. George Eliot’s fellow-feeling comes of the habit she ascribes to Daniel Deronda, “the habit of thinking herself imaginatively into the experience of others.” That is the reason why her novels come home so pitilessly to those who have had a deep experience of human life. These are the men and women whom she fascinates and alienates. I know strong men and brave women who are afraid of her books, and say so. It is because of her realness, her unrelenting fidelity to human nature and human life. It is because the analysis is so delicate, subtle, and far-in. Hence the atmosphere of sadness that pervades her pages. It was unavoidable. To see only the behavior, as Dickens did, amuses us; to study only the motive at the root of the behavior, as George Eliot does, saddens us. The humor of Mrs. Poyser and the wit of Mrs. <b>Transome</b> only deepen the pathos by relieving it. There is hardly a sarcasm in these books but has its pensive undertone.|$|E
50|$|Harold <b>Transome</b> begins legal {{proceedings}} against Jermyn for the latter's mismanagement of the <b>Transome</b> estate. Jermyn counters {{by threatening to}} publicise the true owner of the <b>Transome</b> estate. However, Maurice Christian informs the Transomes that the true owner of the estate is in fact Esther Lyon. Harold <b>Transome</b> invites her to the <b>Transome</b> estate, hoping to persuade her to marry him. Harold and Esther establish a good rapport, and Esther also becomes more sympathetic with Mrs. <b>Transome,</b> whose despair has continued to deepen. Esther feels torn between Harold <b>Transome</b> and Felix Holt. She compares a life of comfortable wealth with Harold <b>Transome</b> and motherly affection with Mrs. <b>Transome,</b> {{to a life of}} personal growth in poverty with Felix Holt. Meanwhile, at Felix Holt's trial, Rev. Lyon, Harold <b>Transome</b> and Esther Lyon all vouch for his character, but he is nevertheless found guilty of manslaughter. However, Harold <b>Transome</b> and the Debarrys manage to have Felix Holt pardoned.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas Trounsem - Bill sticker and {{resident}} of the <b>Transome</b> estate. He {{is in fact a}} member of the <b>Transome</b> family who lives in disempowered poverty. While he remains alive, the <b>Transome</b> estate legally remains with the <b>Transome</b> family. However, when Tommy Trounsem dies in the election day riots, Esther Lyon becomes the rightful owner of the <b>Transome</b> estate.|$|E
5000|$|Mr. <b>Transome,</b> Snr - Father of Harold <b>Transome.</b> Mr. <b>Transome,</b> Snr is senile, and {{the estate}} is managed by Mrs. <b>Transome</b> and Matthew Jermyn, prior to Harold Transome's return to England. He enjoys playing with Harold Transome's young son, Harry.|$|E
5000|$|Matthew Jermyn - <b>Transome</b> family {{lawyer and}} former {{manager of the}} <b>Transome</b> estate. He agrees to act as Harold Transome's agent during county elections. However, after <b>Transome</b> discovers his {{mismanagement}} of the estate, Jermyn devises plans to stave off prosecution. He discovers a possible contestor to the ownership of the <b>Transome</b> estate, information which he tries to use against Harold. Jermyn also earns the disdain of John Johnson and Maurice Christian. He also holds one other secret from <b>Transome.</b>|$|E
50|$|Harold <b>Transome</b> {{learns that}} Jermyn has been mismanaging the <b>Transome</b> estate and embezzling money for himself. <b>Transome</b> remains silent during the election, yet Jermyn tries {{to devise a}} plan to save himself from future prosecution. Meanwhile, Felix {{witnesses}} some electioneering for the Radical cause in the nearby mining town of Sproxton. He is upset with the 'treating' of workers with beer {{in exchange for their}} vocal support. Felix relays his concerns to Harold <b>Transome,</b> who chastises John Johnson for his electioneering methods. However, Jermyn convinces <b>Transome</b> not to interfere.|$|E
50|$|Harold <b>Transome</b> {{proposes to}} Esther Lyon, with the eager support of Mrs. <b>Transome.</b> But despite Esther's {{feelings}} towards both Harold and Mrs. <b>Transome,</b> she declines the proposal. In an altercation between Jermyn and Harold <b>Transome,</b> it is revealed that Jermyn is Harold Transome's father. Harold considers he {{will no longer}} be suitable for marriage to Esther. Esther also surrenders her claim to the <b>Transome</b> estate. The story ends with Felix Holt and Esther Lyon marrying and moving away from Treby, along with Rev. Lyon. Matthew Jermyn is eventually ruined and moves abroad, while John Johnson remains and prospers as a lawyer. The Debarrys remain friends with the Transomes, and the contest to the <b>Transome</b> estate, while widely known, is never discussed.|$|E
5000|$|Mrs. <b>Transome</b> - Mother of Harold <b>Transome.</b> Her husband's {{senility}} {{has left}} her {{in charge of the}} <b>Transome</b> estate while her sons are absent. Prior {{to the beginning of the}} story, her irresponsible oldest son has died, and she is eagerly anticipating her younger son's return to England. Harold <b>Transome</b> does return, but her expectations of their happy future life are dashed soon after. Her son treats her kindly but insensitively, and Mrs. Transome's despair over her changing situation deepens as the story progresses.|$|E
5000|$|Rev. John Lingon - Rector of Little Treby {{and uncle}} to Harold <b>Transome.</b> Despite his own Tory background, he agrees to help Harold <b>Transome</b> with the election.|$|E
5000|$|Harold <b>Transome</b> - 35-year-old wealthy {{landowner}} {{recently returned}} to Treby from a 15-year trading {{career in the}} Far East. He returns to England a widower with a young son, Harry. He runs for the county seat of North Loamshire in parliamentary elections as a Radical, contrary to his family's Tory traditions. Not long after his return to England, he discovers Jermyn's mismanagement of the <b>Transome</b> estate, and while using Jermyn as an electioneering agent, Harold <b>Transome</b> devises legal proceedings against him. The {{relationship between the two}} men deteriorates as the story progresses. Jermyn confronts him with information on a possible contestor to the ownership of the <b>Transome</b> estate. Harold <b>Transome</b> also takes a liking to Esther Lyon later in the story.|$|E
5000|$|Set {{during the}} time of the Reform Act of 1832, the story centres on an {{election}} contested by Harold <b>Transome,</b> a local landowner, in the [...] "Radical cause" [...] ("Radical" [...] because Transome's version of [...] "radicalism" [...] isn't radical at all, but rather an application of the term to his politically stagnate lifestyle), contrary to his family's Tory traditions. Contrasting with the opportunism of <b>Transome</b> is the sincere, but opinionated, Radical Felix Holt. A subplot concerns the stepdaughter of a Dissenting minister who is the true heir to the <b>Transome</b> estate, but who is unaware of the fact. She becomes the object of the affections of both Harold <b>Transome</b> and Felix Holt.|$|E
5000|$|Maurice Christian - Servant of Philip Debarry. He discovers {{and reveals}} {{critical}} information to various characters {{at different stages}} throughout the story. Sir Maximus Debarry learns through Maurice Christian that Harold <b>Transome</b> is a Radical candidate. Rev. Lyon learns through an interview with Christian the possible identity of Esther's biological father. Jermyn confronts Christian about his past, identifying him as Henry Scaddon, a criminal who was held in a French prison with one Maurice Christian Bycliffe, with whom he swapped names. Mr. Bycliffe was thus discovered to be Esther Lyon's biological father. Maurice Christian encounters a bill sticker named Tommy Trounsem who has a rightful claim to the <b>Transome</b> estate. But upon Trounsem's death, Maurice Christian informs Harold <b>Transome</b> about Esther Lyon's rightful claim to the <b>Transome</b> estate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Transome</b> Court (thought to {{be based}} on Stoneleigh Abbey).|$|E
50|$|As {{the story}} starts, {{the reader is}} {{introduced}} to the fictitious community of Treby in the English Midlands in 1832, {{around the time of}} the First Reform Act. Harold <b>Transome,</b> a local landowner, has returned home after a fifteen-year trading career in the Far East. Wealthy from trade, he stands for election to Parliament from the county seat of North Loamshire. But contrary to his family's Tory traditions, he intends to stand as a Radical. This alienates him from his traditional allies and causes despair for his mother, Mrs. <b>Transome.</b> Harold <b>Transome</b> gains the support of his Tory uncle, the Rector of Little Treby, and enlists the help of his family lawyer, Matthew Jermyn, as an electioneering agent.|$|E
5000|$|John Johnson - Electioneering agent {{working for}} Harold <b>Transome.</b> Mr. Johnson {{receives}} the patronage of Matthew Jermyn, although he harbours {{a growing sense}} of resentment towards his patron. He encourages a group of miners in a Sproxton pub to vocally support the Radical cause, by 'treating' them to beer, over the objections of Felix Holt and Harold <b>Transome.</b> This tactic backfires when the intoxicated workers become a riotous mob on election day.|$|E
5000|$|Esther Lyon - Stepdaughter of the Dissenting {{minister}} in Treby Magna, Rev. Rufus Lyon. Esther earns a modest income as a teacher. She {{also has a}} refined sense of fashion and manners. Her refined appearance and behaviour appear repugnant to Felix Holt at first, but her developing earnestness softens his disdain. Learning {{that she is not}} Rev. Lyon's biological daughter does not diminish her filial affection, but rather it strengthens their relationship. Her new past brings her potential new wealth when she learns that she is the true heir to the <b>Transome</b> estate. Later in the story, Esther feels torn between Felix Holt and Harold <b>Transome,</b> both of whom are in love with her.|$|E
50|$|The story depicts {{private life}} inexorably {{determined}} by wider public life, {{exemplified by the}} thrust of the previously isolated Treby Magna into national politics. Woven into this theme are observations of feminine submission and male dominance. Mrs. Transome's personal despair deepens as her kind but insensitive son brings the <b>Transome</b> family into conflict with traditional Tory allies and with Matthew Jermyn, with whom she shares a particular understanding. She feels equally helpless as the ownership of the <b>Transome</b> estate comes into question. Mirroring this is the situation of Mrs. Holt, whose kind but insensitive son deprives her of her intended living. She is equally helpless when Felix Holt's headstrong actions leads to his own arrest, throwing the family into financial peril.|$|E
