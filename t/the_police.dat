During the last stages of the incident, another aircraft was parked beside the MD-82, which <b>the</b> <b>police</b> confirmed played a role {{towards the end of the}} hijacking. All communication towards the central government was made to the Norwegian Ministry of Justice, and neither the prime minister of the minister of foreign affairs was ever contacted. No weapons were found on either the aircraft nor on the hijacker.|$|E

Breyer held that the actions <b>the</b> <b>police</b> did not do, such as arrest Alvarado or threaten him, were {{not as important as}} what <b>the</b> <b>police</b> did do. Specifically, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> had Alvarado's parents bring him to <b>the</b> <b>police</b> station, brought Alvarado to an interrogation room, kept his parents out, and questioned him for two hours.|$|E

Frank said he was not familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would need to check his payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan's body and then to the factory, where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked <b>the</b> <b>police</b> through the entire building. Frank returned home about 10:45a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.|$|E

5|$|Extending the police's {{presence}} {{across the}} region was logistically challenging, requiring {{the creation of a}} network of new posts and the use of steamers to move supplies around the coast. It proved to be a harsh existence for the force, particularly when deliveries of supplies were delayed by bad weather. Work began on a railroad to Hudson Bay in 1908, continuing for two decades, which, although it required substantial police assistance, gradually eased the challenge of supplying <b>the</b> <b>police</b> outposts around the bay. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> opened temporary detachments around York Factory in 1912, and then at Port Nelson in 1913, where <b>the</b> <b>police</b> established their divisional headquarters.
