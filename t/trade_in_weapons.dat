2500|$|The first precept is the abstaining {{from the}} taking of life, and the Buddha clearly stated that {{the taking of}} human or animal life would lead to {{negative}} karmic consequences and was non conductive to liberation. Right livelihood includes not <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>weapons</b> or <b>in</b> hunting and butchering animals. Various suttas state that one should always have a mind filled with compassion and loving kindness for all beings, {{this is to be}} extended to hurtful, evil people {{as in the case of}} Angulimala the murderer and to every kind of animal, even pests and vermin (monks are not allowed to kill any animal, for any reason). Buddhist teachings and institutions therefore tend to promote peace and compassion, acting as safe havens during times of conflict. [...] In spite of this, some Buddhists, including monastics such as Japanese warrior monks have historically performed acts of violence. In China, the Shaolin Monastery developed a martial arts tradition to defend themselves from attack.|$|R

5000|$|To {{prevent the}} Vikings from even {{attaining}} a great booty, Charles also declared that fortified bridges should be built at all towns on rivers.

[...] Charles also prohibited all <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>weapons</b> with the Vikings, in order to prevent them from establishing bases in Gaul.
