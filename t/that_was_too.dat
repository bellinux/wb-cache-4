5|$|Composer Richard Strauss was {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Reichsmusikkammer (Reich Music Chamber) on its founding in November 1933. As {{was the case with}} other art forms, the Nazis ostracised musicians who were deemed racially unacceptable {{and for the most part}} disapproved of music <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> modern or atonal. Jazz was considered especially inappropriate and foreign jazz musicians left the country or were expelled. Hitler favoured the music of Richard Wagner, especially pieces based on Germanic myths and heroic stories and attended the Bayreuth Festival each year from 1933.|$|E
5|$|Like {{nearly all}} extrasolar planets {{discovered}} prior to 2008, PSR B1620-26 b was originally detected through the Doppler shifts its orbit induces on {{radiation from the}} star it orbits (in this case, changes in the apparent pulsation period of the pulsar). In the early 1990s, a group of astronomers led by Donald Backer, who were studying {{what they thought was}} a binary pulsar, determined that a third object was needed to explain the observed Doppler shifts. Within a few years, the gravitational effects of the planet on the orbit of the pulsar and white dwarf had been measured, giving an estimate of the mass of the third object <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> small for it to be a star. The conclusion that the third object was a planet was announced by Stephen Thorsett and his collaborators in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Moonraker is {{the third}} novel by the British author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond. It was {{published}} by Jonathan Cape on 5 April 1955 and featured a cover design conceived by Fleming. The plot is derived from a Fleming screenplay <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> short for a full novel so he added {{the passage of the}} bridge game between Bond and the industrialist Hugo Drax. In {{the latter half of the}} novel, Bond is seconded to Drax's staff as the businessman builds the Moonraker, a prototype missile designed to defend England. Unknown to Bond, Drax is German, an ex-Nazi now working for the Soviets; his plan is to build the rocket, arm it with a nuclear warhead, and fire it at London. Uniquely for a Bond novel, Moonraker is set entirely in Britain, which raised comments from some readers, complaining about the lack of exotic locations.|$|E

40|$|Policymakers {{almost universally}} {{conclude}} that persistent achievement gaps must result from wrongly designed school policies — either expectations <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> low, {{teachers who are}} insufficiently qualified, curricula <b>that</b> <b>are</b> badly designed, classes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> large, schoolclimates <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> undisciplined, leadership <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> unfocused, {{or a combination of}} these. This exclusive focus on schooling is wrong. Without complementary investments in early childhood preparation, health care, housing, after-school and summer programs, and other social and economic supports, the achievement gap will never be closed. Academic achievement between lower-class and middle-class children requires not only better schools, although those are certainly needed, Americans have concluded that the achievement gap is the fault of “failing schools...|$|R
