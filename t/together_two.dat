5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the African coast on July 19. The system headed westward through the Atlantic Ocean {{for the next}} week with no change in development. After entering the Caribbean Sea on July 26, convection began to come <b>together</b> <b>two</b> days later due to the influence of anticyclonic flow. The disturbance passed the Yucatan Peninsula on July 29 and entered the Gulf of Mexico. No circulation was found in the developing system, however.|$|E
5|$|Richard III was {{followed}} by another adaptation, the comedy, Love Makes a Man, which was constructed by splicing <b>together</b> <b>two</b> plays by John Fletcher: The Elder Brother and The Custom of the Country. Cibber's confidence was apparently restored {{by the success of}} the two plays, and he returned to more original writing.|$|E
5|$|The Petition {{caused a}} flurry of {{broadside}} satires, poems and ballads on the subject through the following year. The historian James Turner identifies this event {{as an example of}} a new carnivalisation of sexuality in Restoration England, where genuine political attack, satire, street commentary and bawdy theatre came <b>together.</b> <b>Two</b> years after the riots, a mob gathered once more and again swore they would raze Cresswell's cathouse to the ground, though protection from the local beadles prevented the attack.|$|E

5|$|Bågenholm's colleagues made {{an attempt}} to free her but failed. At 18:27 local time (CET), seven minutes after she {{had fallen into the}} water, they called for help on a mobile phone. Police {{lieutenant}} Bård Mikalsen received the call and put <b>together</b> <b>two</b> rescue teams; one {{at the top of the}} mountain and one at the bottom. Mikalsen also contacted the Bodø rescue team, which was equipped with a Sea King helicopter, but they told him that the helicopter had left to transport a sick child. Mikalsen was persistent and convinced the dispatcher to turn the helicopter around.|$|E
5|$|Craven and Jedburgh escape Northmoor {{but both}} are dying from {{radiation}} poisoning. Jedburgh makes for the Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland, which is hosting a NATO conference on directed energy weapons. Also {{present at the}} conference is Grogan who announces that the British government has approved the purchase of IIF and speaks with cold passion of harnessing {{the power of the}} atom to conquer the galaxy. The audience of military and civilian officials applauds but Jedburgh in U.S. uniform takes the dais to denounce nuclear proliferation and a vainglorious crusade amongst the stars. He finishes by bringing <b>together</b> <b>two</b> bars of plutonium he has removed from Northmoor, causing a criticality accident and irradiating himself and the nearby Grogan.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Allen Hughes (born October 13, 1973) is {{a retired}} American mixed martial artist with a {{background}} in wrestling. He is a two-time UFC Welterweight Champion, UFC Hall of Fame inductee, and NJCAA Hall of Fame inductee. During his tenures in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, Hughes put <b>together</b> <b>two</b> separate six-fight winning streaks, defeated all the available opposition in the welterweight division, and defended the belt a then-record seven times. Hughes {{was inducted into the}} UFC Hall of Fame in May 2010 during the UFC Fan Expo in conjunction with UFC 114.|$|E

5|$|The idea of Ranko brought <b>together</b> <b>two</b> popular fictional {{creatures of}} the 1930s; the giant ape King Kong, who had been {{introduced}} in the film King Kong (1933), and the Loch Ness Monster, a cryptid who was to have lived in Loch Ness. Gaston Leroux's character of Balaoo the gorilla, who had appeared in a 1911 book and a 1913 film, might also have been an influence on Ranko. The plot and themes of the story were also influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 film The 39 Steps, itself an adaptation of John Buchan's 1915 adventure novel.|$|E
5|$|With Van Melkebeke, Hergé put <b>together</b> <b>two</b> Tintin plays. The first, Tintin in the Indies, {{appeared}} at Brussels' Theatre des Galeries in April 1941, while the second, Mr Boullock's Disappearance, was performed there in December. From October 1941 to May 1942, Le Soir serialised Hergé's next Tintin adventure, The Shooting Star, followed by publication {{as a single}} volume by Casterman. In keeping with Le Soirs editorial standpoint, The Shooting Star espoused an anti-Semitic and anti-American attitude, with the antagonist being a wealthy Jewish American businessman; it would thus prove particularly controversial in the post-war period, although Hergé denied any malicious anti-Semitic intention.|$|E
5|$|Amidst {{the flames}} and rubble, Arenberg's and Ferdinand's troops tried to storm the castle, but {{found their way}} blocked by masses of debris created by their own explosives. Furthermore, {{although}} close to half of the garrison had perished in the explosion and subsequent collapse of the fortifications, those who remained offered staunch resistance by throwing rocks on the approaching attackers, causing {{a large number of}} casualties. In frustration, 40 or 50 of the attackers tied <b>together</b> <b>two</b> ladders and crawled through the sluice-ways of the garderobe (latrines) that emptied on the hillside, thus gaining access to the interior of the castle. There they killed around 20 of the defenders in fierce fighting; the remaining defenders, approximately 70 men, among them Buchner and Sudermann, the garrison commander and his lieutenant, sought refuge in the castle's keep. In this way, Ferdinand's infantry at last gained unopposed access to the fortress. Storming the castle had taken about two hours.|$|E

5|$|Literary scholar M. Keith Booker {{argues that}} Vargas Llosa perfects the {{technique}} of interlacing dialogues in his novel The Green House. By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates {{the illusion of a}} flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving <b>together</b> <b>two</b> concurrent conversations happening in different places. This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using {{near the end of his}} first novel, The Time of the Hero. However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in The Green House the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space. In contrast, Captain Pantoja and the Special Service employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts. This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.|$|E

25|$|The Satyricon is {{considered}} one of the gems of Western literature, and may be the earliest extant work classifiable as a novel, although some would give that honour to Chariton's Callirhoe. Petronius mixes <b>together</b> <b>two</b> antithetical genres: the cynic and parodic menippean satire, and the idealizing and sentimental Greek romance. The mixing of these two radically contrasting genres generates the sophisticated humor and ironic tone of Satyricon.|$|E
