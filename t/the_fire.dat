5|$|A {{small fire}} {{broke out in the}} gas turbine engine room (located high on the ship behind the Queen Mary 2 sign) on the evening of 5 October 2011. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> was started in one of the ship's gas turbines.

5|$|According to the Accident Investigation Board Norway, {{the rescue}} work was {{hampered}} by, among other things: lack of fire crew at Voss to drive <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> engine, a defective helicopter bucket, and a three-hour delay from <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> to a rail carriage with water was sent from Ål. Also, <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> carriage from Voss arrived six {{hours after the}} accident was reported. Concerns were raised regarding <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> hazards of wooden snow tunnels, and the National Rail Administration admitted {{that they should be}} made of a more fire-proof material, such as concrete or steel. Following the accident, the National Rail Administration decided that all welding would have to be monitored for several hours after completion of the work.|$|E
50|$|Speculation {{ascribed}} <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> {{to various}} natural and supernatural causes. <b>The</b> <b>fires</b> stopped in August. In 2008 investigators concluded that <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> were arson cases.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Detail of Mark 6 exploder. For contact operation, the {{collision}} of the torpedo with the target ship would move <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> ring and release <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> pin stem. <b>The</b> <b>firing</b> pin stem would then move vertically (powered by <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> spring) and detonate the tetryl booster charge. The mechanism worked for low-speed torpedoes, but for the high-speed Mark 14 torpedo, the same impact deceleration that caused <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> ring to move was also large enough to cause <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> pin stem to bind and fail to detonate the booster.|$|R

5|$|An {{example of}} the urge to {{identify}} scapegoats for <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> is {{the acceptance of the}} confession of a simple-minded French watchmaker named Robert Hubert, who claimed that he was an agent of the Pope and had started the Great Fire in Westminster. He later changed his story to say that he had started <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> at the bakery in Pudding Lane. Hubert was convicted, despite some misgivings about his fitness to plead, and hanged at Tyburn on 28 September 1666. After his death, it became apparent that he had been on board a ship in the North Sea, and had not arrived in London until two days after <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> started. These allegations that Catholics had started <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> were exploited as powerful political propaganda by opponents of pro-Catholic Charles II's court, mostly during the Popish Plot and the exclusion crisis later in his reign.|$|E
5|$|Another {{monument}} {{marks the}} spot where <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> stopped: the Golden Boy of Pye Corner in Smithfield.

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> {{was going}} into its sixth hour it had spread up to the 26th floor. With {{inadequate}} water pressure coming from the standpipes, firefighters stretched hoses up the building's stairwells to help fight <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> While hoses were being taken up to <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> a sprinkler technician arrived to fix the water pressure. This improved the hose streams, but <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> had engulfed several floors {{and could not be}} contained with just hoses. By 7:00 AM, almost eleven hours into <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> firefighters were able to get control of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> on the 22nd through 24th floors, but <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> was still out of control on the 25th and 26th floors and was spreading upwards. Structural damage observed inside the building by firefighters and consultations with a structural engineer led to fears that the damaged floors might collapse. At 7:00 AM an order to evacuate the building was issued by Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer, and the building was completely evacuated by 7:30 AM. After the evacuation, the only fire suppression efforts left were water streams being directed to the building from the neighboring Girard Trust Building and One Centre Square.|$|E

5|$|At {{the peak}} of <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> nearly 2,000 firefighters were {{assigned}} to the incident. Approximately 19 residents lost power as Southern California Edison was forced to shut down transmission lines that passed through <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> ground.|$|E
5|$|California {{governor}} Jerry Brown {{declared a}} state of emergency for the city of San Francisco on August 23, after <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> caused damage to the power infrastructure serving the Bay Area, causing two out of the existing three hydroelectric power plants to shut down. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> also threatened the Hetch Hetchy reservoir, the main source of water for San Francisco, providing up to 85% of the city's supply to 2.6 million customers. On August 26, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission moved water away from Hetch Hetchy into downstream reservoirs located in San Mateo and Alameda Counties as a precautionary measure, but did not expect <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> to cause any disruption to the city's water supply. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> advanced to within a mile of Hetch Hetchy by Monday, August 26, which was a concern to O'Shaughnessy Dam officials due to ash falling in the water.|$|E

5|$|During {{the height}} of the typhoon at Cabras Island on Guam, a {{gasoline}} tank caught fire, believed to be from friction caused by extremely high winds running through its ventilation system.

The proximity of the tanks as well as low water pressure hampered firefighting efforts, and <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> was extinguished five days later; it resulted in three destroyed gasoline tanks with two more caught on fire. While <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> was burning, transportation of gasoline from the port to the rest of Guam was suspended resulting in a halt in gasoline sales for the general public.|$|E

A failure to identify the test as hazardous (because the rocket was unfueled) led to the rescue being hampered by poor emergency preparedness.|$|E
