5|$|Several factors {{combine to}} create the dump months, most of them {{circumstances}} particular to the United States and Canada, the primary market for most major Hollywood releases. Both periods immediately follow the times of {{year in which the}} distributors concentrate films they expect <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> critical and/or commercial successes, periods of increased spending on entertainment generally. While this often means that moviegoers have less disposable income afterwards, economics alone does not explain the dump months. The weather and competition from other forms of mass entertainment, especially professional sports, also play a part; the winter dump months are further affected by the Academy Awards eligibility rules.|$|E
5|$|Media {{attention}} was also {{directed at the}} teams' offensive capabilities. Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year in the week {{leading up to the}} game. In {{the first half of the}} 2007 season, Ryan had been prominently mentioned in candidate lists for the Heisman Trophy, college football's highest individual award. Although Ryan's late-game comeback in their previous game against Virginia Tech had made him a front-runner, the team's two subsequent losses to unranked teams dropped him from contention for the Heisman. Excellent performances in a division-clinching win at Clemson and against Miami seemed to return Ryan to Heisman-candidate form, however, and heading into the ACC Championship Game, Ryan appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> offensive threat for Boston College.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} Munro, an {{excellent}} observer who spent years on Lānai, only saw the bird three times implies {{that it was}} already very rare by the 1910s. From 1900 to 1940 nearly all of Lānai's forests were converted into pineapple fields. This conversion reduced {{the area of the}} hookbill's potential habitat, and is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> contributor to the species' extinction. It has also been suggested that avian malaria, which began affecting Lānai's birds in the 1920s, {{may have contributed to the}} species' decline. Likewise, the introduction of feral cats and rats to Lānai may have led to a decline in the hookbill's population. The extinction of local snails through human intervention could also have led to the Lānai hookbill's extinction.|$|E
