He holds a jewelled processional cross in his left hand, and a wheel containing five lit tapered candles in his right.

5|$|Countries with {{decades of}} {{experience}} in comprehensive emergency medical systems have expertise that nations <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> beginning emergency medical programs lack. Thus, there exists considerable opportunity for the transfer of knowledge to assist newly founded programs. Such transfers may be made either from a distance or in person. For instance, the International Emergency Medicine Fellowship at the University of Toronto sent a three-person team to Cluj-Napoca, Romania, to promote the local development of emergency medicine. An assessment of the present status was performed that identified targets for improvement in physical plant organization and patient flow; staffing, staff education, equipment, medication and supplies; and infection control practices. Following these designations, plans regarding these areas were collaboratively drawn up and then implemented, partially through international exchange trips.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{getting out}} of prison, Turner sets up a gang that engages in shady {{activities}} <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> {{within the boundaries of}} the law. She also marries Gilder's son. A member of the gang attempts to rob the home of Turner's new father-in-law at the urging of a police stooge attempting to entrap the gang. When the stooge reveals the plot, the gang member kills him, leaving Turner and her new husband at the scene to be found by the police. It seems that Turner may go to prison again, but she is saved when the guilty party confesses that she had no involvement in the crimes.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Hawking {{had shown}} earlier {{that the total}} horizon area of a {{collection}} of black holes always increases with time. The horizon is a boundary defined by light-like geodesics; it is those light rays <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> barely unable to escape. If neighboring geodesics start moving toward each other they eventually collide, at which point their extension is inside the black hole. So the geodesics are always moving apart, and the number of geodesics which generate the boundary, the area of the horizon, always increases. Hawking's result was called the second law of black hole thermodynamics, by analogy with the law of entropy increase, but at first, he did not take the analogy too seriously.|$|E

25|$|Gloves {{protect and}} comfort hands against cold or heat, damage by friction, {{abrasion}} or chemicals, and disease; or {{in turn to}} provide a guard for what a bare hand should not touch. Latex, nitrile rubber or vinyl disposable gloves are often worn by health care professionals as hygiene and contamination protection measures. Police officers often wear them to work in crime scenes to prevent destroying evidence in the scene. Many criminals wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints, which makes the crime investigation more difficult. However, the gloves themselves can leave prints <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> as unique as human fingerprints. After collecting glove prints, law enforcement can then match them to gloves that they have collected as evidence. In many jurisdictions the act of wearing gloves itself while committing a crime can be prosecuted as an inchoate offense.|$|E

McHale and his crew tried to maintain a balance between frightening imagery and [...] "episodes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> light and funny". For the music, McHale drew inspiration from [...] "classic American, opera singing". Nick Cross served as art director and Nate Cash as supervising director; both worked with McHale alongside storyboard artists located in New York and Chicago. This distance proved difficult for McHale, who found it [...] "particularly daunting considering the idiosyncratic nature of the production".|$|E
500|$|The most massive main-sequence stars {{will also}} have the highest {{absolute}} magnitude, and these {{will be the first}} to evolve into the giant star stage. As the cluster ages, stars of successively lower masses will also enter the giant star stage. Thus the age of a single population cluster can be measured by looking for the stars <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> beginning to enter the giant star stage. This forms a [...] "knee" [...] in the HR diagram, bending to the upper right from the main-sequence line. The absolute magnitude at this bend is directly a function of the age of globular cluster, so an age scale can be plotted on an axis parallel to the magnitude.|$|E
500|$|On 2 October 2011 Radio Netherlands Worldwide {{reported}} that a retired Dutch politician of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) Frits Bolkestein, who is sometime called the 'mentor' of Geert Wilders, [...] "does not share his views". He reportedly said that [...] "Wilders says things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> not right and I think he totally exaggerates." [...] While giving his opinion on burqa ban Mr Bolkestein said that he [...] "disagrees with the recent introduction of a burqa ban, an idea championed by Geert Wilders." [...] The Netherlands, he said, is the third European country to introduce such a ban after France and Belgium. [...] "A ban makes martyrs of the few burqa wearers {{there are in the}} Netherlands", he said.|$|E

500|$|During the Steve Lillywhite sessions, Lee {{described}} the album as a [...] "rainbow of sounds" [...] with heavy, stripped-out songs. According to Lee, it had electro influences {{and a lot}} of drum programming. During the later sessions with Nick Raskulincecz, she discussed two of the album's themes: brokenness ("Brokenness has become a little bit of theme, without necessarily offering a solution") and oceans. In a later MTV interview, Lee mentioned other themes: [...] "the quest for freedom, and then there's songs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> about falling in love". She said that Evanescence used new and vintage instruments (such as a harp, synthesizers and the Moog Taurus Pedal) and recorded the ballads [...] "Secret Door" [...] and [...] "My Heart Is Broken". In a Kerrang! interview, Lee said she was inspired by her life and personal relationships.|$|E
500|$|Woods {{continued}} {{to excel in}} 2007 and {{the first part of}} 2008. In April 2008, he underwent knee surgery and missed the next two months on the tour. Woods returned for the 2008 U.S. Open, where he struggled the first day but ultimately claimed a dramatic sudden death victory over Rocco Mediate that followed an 18 hole playoff, after which Mediate said, [...] "This guy does things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> not normal {{by any stretch of the}} imagination," [...] and Kenny Perry added, [...] "He beat everybody on one leg." [...] Two days later, Woods announced that he would miss the remainder of the season due to additional knee surgery, and that his knee was more severely damaged than previously revealed, prompting even greater praise for his U.S. Open performance. Woods called it [...] "my greatest ever championship." [...] In Woods' absence, TV ratings for the remainder of the season suffered a huge decline from 2007.|$|E
500|$|Edna Gunderson of USA Today was positive, commenting, [...] "The music, while upbeat {{and even}} giddy, steers away from {{adolescent}} pranks and pratfalls, a welcome upgrade. The band creates a fresh breed of post-punk power pop by roughing up bright melodies." [...] AllMusic's Brian O'Neill gave the album three stars, {{calling it a}} [...] "far cry from the party-boy ethos DeLonge is best known for, and he wears the emotional depth well, with songs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> as hooky as from his bread-winning main squeeze." [...] A reviewer for Q admitted that the musicians [...] "confound expectations with a very good record." [...] The positive reception of the album was {{in contrast to the}} reviews for Blink, which were often negative. [...] "I think it's a cop-out for [...] to like the music I do," [...] DeLonge told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "Critics can't say they like Blink or give us any credit, 'cause we're out there goofing around." [...] Barker was more critical: [...] "I especially don't care what the critics say. Most of them are like 50 years old and they're not really educated in what kind of music we're playing to begin with!" ...|$|E

500|$|Although Gordon's lyrics on Experimental Jet Set {{addressed}} {{gender roles}} and stereotypes, her contributions to Washing Machine were considered more feminine and girl-oriented. Tom Moon of Rolling Stone noted, [...] "The title track is an odd, earnest love song; 'Panty Lies' is a playground taunt blown to absurd extremes; and ' Trouble Girl', the Spector sendup, is a dramatic, earnest coming-of-age story". The latter {{was described by}} David Browne of Entertainment Weekly as [...] "a teen-pregnancy lullaby" [...] and features vocals by Gordon and Kim Deal (of Pixies and the Breeders) along with other musicians. Gordon felt that Deal had an ideal voice for the melodic part and explained that the song was about [...] "wanting to be seen for who you really are, being able to express those parts of yourself that aren't 'good girl' but <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> as real and true". Ranaldo contributed to two songs, [...] "Saucer-Like" [...] and [...] "Skip Tracer". The latter was co-written with Ranaldo's wife Leah Singer and inspired by a performance that the couple attended of riot grrrl duo Mecca Normal. The song alludes to the band's special relationship with the major labels.|$|E
500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "To the Blade", {{focuses on}} the death of Manchester-born aid worker Alan Henning at the hands of ISIL's [...] "Jihadi John". Higgs {{explained}} to Drowned in Sound that: [...] "He was a taxi driver from Stockport, I could have met him. And the fact that someone who did it was also from Britain, but this was being played out on a global scale... It seemed like the craziest thing I’d ever heard." [...] Other songs criticise political leaders in the United Kingdom. Higgs had been vocal of his distaste of politics in interviews following the release of Arc. Several critics suggest that [...] "The Wheel (Is Turning Now)" [...] is a commentary on the [...] "snake-oil appeal" [...] of then-UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage; Higgs told The Line of Best Fit that the song also comments on [...] "religious leaders and charismatic, corrupt leaders, or even men as gods". [...] "No Reptiles" [...] supposes that political leaders are [...] "just fat, bald, old men, like soft-boiled eggs, <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> weak-willed, with no strong feelings (good or ill)"; its lyrics also make cryptic reference to Elliot Rodger, who carried out the 2014 Isla Vista killings.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{found the}} soundtrack to lack the focus that Activision claims it has, {{and that the}} series may have {{exhausted}} a number of good guitar songs in its previous iterations. Arthur Gies of IGN stated that the game soundtrack [...] "may be the most uneven collection {{in any of the}} main Guitar Hero titles", citing problems with [...] "a surplus of tracks that seem out of place", [...] "too many songs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> boring to play", and [...] "a number of synth heavy songs that are nevertheless shoehorned" [...] into the game. Official Xbox Magazine UK stated that the setlist [...] "feels at times uninspired, incongruous and uninteresting". Game Informers Matt Helgeson felt that the setlist was [...] "a mixed bag", with a strong and balanced set of songs in the early tiers of Quest Mode, while the latter, more difficult songs were [...] "terrible and felt like a chore" [...] to complete. Roger Hargreaves of Metro commented that [...] "with so many of the more iconic rock songs having already been used in previous Guitar Hero and Rock Band games developers are forced to use ever more obscure songs and/or acts". On the other hand, USA Todays Mike Snider claimed that the game's soundtrack [...] "gave [...] a reason to blast music on [...] stereo", and besides providing well-known songs and bands, introduced him to new bands.|$|E
