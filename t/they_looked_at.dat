5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Letlive {{began writing}} on the third album. Butler said that their writing {{approach}} changed in comparison to their previous releases, as they were now doing most of it while on tour. During pre-production, the band listened to styles and ideas that, according to Butler, changed the way <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the songs they had initially written. The styles were their most expansive to date, and came from the diversity of their members: Butler had involved himself in the punk rock skateboarding culture when he was eleven, but had also been influenced by his father, {{who was in a}} soul band.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Barry Cunliffe decided {{to examine a}} single hill fort and its {{surrounding}} territory {{in an attempt to}} shed light on Iron Age society, its politics, and population. With the permission of the site's owner, Hampshire County Council, archaeological excavations began in 1969 and continued until 1988. Over the twentyseasons archaeologists spent examining the site, <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the defences and the gateway, and excavated 57% of the interior, where the remains of wattle and timber houses were discovered. It was the lengthiest investigation of any hill fort in western Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of outsiders {{such as the}} Strangers and the Particulars was a considerable annoyance to the Pilgrims. As early as 1623, a conflict broke out between the Pilgrims and the Strangers over the celebration of Christmas, a day of no particular significance to the Pilgrims. Furthermore, a group of Strangers founded the nearby settlement of Wessagussett and the Pilgrims were highly strained, both emotionally {{and in terms of}} resources, by their lack of discipline. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the eventual failure of the Wessagussett settlement as Divine Providence against a sinful people.|$|E

5|$|Burnet's work on graft-versus-host was in {{collaboration}} with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this {{was known as the}} Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain passenger leukocytes in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune hemolytic anemia. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human autoimmune disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Carvallo published {{a new study}} in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds. In one study <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations that matched their surnames, for example, Baker, Carpenter, and Farmer, something theNew Scientisthas coinednominative determinism. Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami investigated which way the arrow of causality points {{when it comes to}} names influencing choice of occupation. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appeared more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.|$|E
5|$|In Bruce Bagemihl's {{survey of}} The Zoological Record (1978–1997)– which {{contains}} {{over a million}} documents from over 6,000 scientific journals– 539 articles focusing on the penis were found, while 7 were found focusing on the clitoris. In 2000, researchers Shirley Ogletree and Harvey Ginsberg concluded {{that there is a}} general neglect of the word clitoris in common vernacular. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the terms used to describe genitalia in the PsycINFO database from 1887 to 2000 and found that penis was used in 1,482 sources, vagina in 409, while clitoris was only mentioned in 83. They additionally analyzed 57 books listed in a computer database for sex instruction. In the majority of the books, penis was the most commonly discussed body part– mentioned more than clitoris, vagina, and uterus put together. They last investigated terminology used by college students, ranging from Euro-American (76%/76%), Hispanic (18%/14%), and African American (4%/7%), regarding the students' beliefs about sexuality and knowledge on the subject. The students were overwhelmingly educated to believe that the vagina is the female counterpart of the penis. The authors found that the students' belief that the inner portion of the vagina is the most sexually sensitive part of the female body correlated with negative attitudes toward masturbation and strong support for sexual myths.|$|E

The brothers also created a detailed system for operating each kitchen throughout the franchise in a similar and largely standardized manner, as well as recruiting adolescents as employees in the kitchens.|$|E

25|$|The sonnets {{were first}} {{published}} together in 1609, although {{evidence points to}} Shakespeare finishing them at least 12 years earlier. A. Kent Hieatt, Charles W. Hieatt, and Anne Lake Prescott published an article in Vol. 88 of Studies in Philology detailing a computer assisted study which partially confirmed this conjecture. It determined that Sonnets 1-60 were first composed sometime in between 1590 and 1595, but then likely revised {{after the turn of}} the century. In order to determine this, <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> how Shakespeare's use of words changed over time and what current events and works he references.|$|E
25|$|<b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{the case}} as a murder, with the {{burglary}} staged to throw the police off the trail. Many aspects of the crime were improbable for a break-in, especially one committed in daylight: Rasmussen's jewelry box, an inviting target for a burglar, was in plain view atop her dresser and had not been touched. The condo {{was in the middle}} of a gated complex, surrounded by other units from which burglars could have expected to be easily observed. The front door had an alarm warning, and had not been forced open, as it might have been if the putative burglars had not expected anyone to be at home.|$|E
25|$|The {{search was}} {{intensified}} with a committee appointed in 1936. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> four sites in Troms—Gibostad, Eidkjosen, Hessfjord and Breivika. The latter included sites both at {{and south of}} Skattøra. It was chosen due to its proximity to Finnmark, proximity to the Navy's offices in Tromsø and good landing conditions {{under a variety of}} wind conditions. The plans included two hangars the size of the ultimate building, two barracks, a terminal two slipways, docks and ammunition storage. The goal was to make the airport the main air station for seaplanes in Northern Norway. Funding of 100,000 Norwegian krone was granted in 1936 and the project was scheduled for completion in 1941.|$|E

Plans were made for a 46,000 seat facility that could be expanded to 80,000 or possibly 100,000. Architects drew up plans for a 17,000 vehicle parking lot. The ceiling of the dome was going to be made from plexi-glass, which would add natural light. The plexi-glass was also {{supposed to be able to}} open for ventilation and an open-air feel. If it was approved, the dome was said to be ready to open by 1968. It was estimated to cost US$25 million (US$ million adjusted for inflation).|$|E
25|$|Most of Hutchinson's {{contributions}} to American limnology came from research at Linsley Pond in Connecticut. Studies were done on small lakes, such as chemical stratification, oxygen deficits, productivity, and the ecological {{significance of the}} oxidation-reduction potential of lake waters. His four volume Treatise on Limnology became a standard for limnology students. Hutchinson expanded the field of limnology, especially in its ecological and biogeochemical aspects. He advocated the use of statistical and mathematical methods in limnology. His student Raymond Lindeman furthered Hutchinson's model of the trophic dynamic concept. Together <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> energy flows through the lake in the trophic levels of ecosystems. They followed the energy using Hutchinson's notation system in which each organism was given an integer to mark how many organisms the energy {{had to go through}} in order to reach it, this was designated as its trophic level. It then became possible to measure the efficiency of a given system, or the energy losses between ascending trophic levels.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the profits}} came {{as a result of}} the company acting as a carrier, rather than from tolls. In {{addition}} to running narrow boats on the canals, they had a thriving business carrying goods across the River Mersey, between Liverpool, Ellesmere Port, and Birkenhead. They made a healthy operating profit until the 1870s, but this then diminished during the next 30 years. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> upgrading the canal to take larger vessels in the 1890s, prompted by the opening of the Manchester Ship Canal, but this did not occur. They saw a brief improvement in their financial position in the early 20th century, but this collapsed with the onset of the First World War. Government subsidies sustained them until 1920, but rising wage costs and the 8-hour day resulted in them ceasing to act as a carrier, and the LNWR bought the company in late 1922. On 1 January 1923, the LNWR became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), with the passing of the Railways Act 1921 (Grouping Act). The Montgomery Canal closed in 1936 after a major breach, and most of the canals were closed under the provisions of an abandonment order obtained in 1944.|$|E
