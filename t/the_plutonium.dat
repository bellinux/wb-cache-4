5|$|Gallium attacks {{most other}} metals by {{diffusing}} into the metal lattice. For example, it diffuses into the grain boundaries of aluminium-zinc alloys and steel, making them very brittle. Gallium easily alloys with many metals, {{and is used}} in small quantities in the plutonium-gallium alloy in <b>the</b> <b>plutonium</b> cores of nuclear bombs to stabilize <b>the</b> <b>plutonium</b> crystal structure.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>the</b> <b>plutonium</b> implosion-type nuclear weapon and <b>the</b> <b>plutonium</b> gun-type fission weapon, the uranium gun-type weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design. The concept was pursued {{so that in}} case of a failure to develop a plutonium bomb, it would still be possible to use the gun principle. The gun-type design henceforth had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted. The simplified weapon was short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay.|$|E

40|$|Approximately 18 of the 50 {{metric tons}} of {{plutonium}} identified for disposition contain significant quantities of impurities.

Cerium is used as <b>the</b> surrogate for <b>plutonium.</b> Three compositions, including the baseline composition, were used to verify {{the ability of the}} ceramic wasteform to accommodate impurities. The criteria for evaluation of the effect of the impurities were the apparent porosity and phase assemblage of sintered pellets...|$|R

50|$|Pu-240 {{undergoes}} {{spontaneous fission}} as a secondary decay mode {{at a small}} but significant rate. The presence of Pu-240 limits <b>the</b> <b>plutonium's</b> use in a nuclear bomb, because the neutron flux from spontaneous fission initiates the chain reaction prematurely, causing an early release of energy that physically disperses the core before full implosion is reached.|$|R
5|$|Another {{major fire}} {{occurred}} on May 11, 1969 in building 776/777 (<b>the</b> <b>Plutonium</b> Processing Facility), again starting due to spontaneous combustion of plutonium shavings in a glove box.

Despite recommendations after the 1957 fire, suppression systems were not built into the glove boxes.|$|E
5|$|As {{plutonium}} was not available, it was substituted {{with material}} with similar mechanical properties. Depleted uranium was used {{but was not}} optimal because of its opacity for radiation; iron, copper, or cadmium were other choices. Cadmium was the choice {{for most of the}} tests. The first shot was performed with an iron mockup of <b>the</b> <b>plutonium</b> pit.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Hanford B Reactor, {{the first}} industrial-sized nuclear reactor for the {{purposes}} of material production, was completed in March 1945.

5|$|Maggie {{tells them}} that the item is a computer, with the {{location}} of five tons of refined plutonium abandoned in a mine by the Soviet Union after the Cold War. Vilain intends to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>plutonium</b> and sell it. The Expendables are able to weakly track the computer's signal and follow Vilain, which leads them to Bulgaria where they stay overnight at an abandoned Russian military base. The next morning, the team is ambushed by the Sangs and a tank. After the Expendables run out of ammunition, they are saved by Ross's old friend, Booker, who quickly eliminates both the Sangs and the tank. Before he departs, Booker informs the group of a nearby village whose residents oppose Vilain. Meanwhile, Hector and Vilain dig up <b>the</b> <b>plutonium</b> and begin collecting it.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 11, 1957, {{plutonium}} shavings in a glove box located in building 771 (<b>the</b> <b>Plutonium</b> Recovery and Fabrication Facility) spontaneously ignited. The fire spread to the flammable glove box materials, including plexiglas windows and rubber gloves. The fire rapidly spread through the interconnected glove boxes and ignited the large bank of High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters located in a plenum downstream. Within minutes the first filters had burned out, allowing plutonium particles {{to escape from the}} building exhaust stacks. The building exhaust fans stopped operating due to fire damage at 10:40 PM, which ended the majority of <b>the</b> <b>plutonium</b> release. Fire fighters initially used carbon dioxide fire extinguishers because water can act as a moderator and cause plutonium to go critical. They resorted to water hoses when the dry fire extinguishers proved ineffective.|$|E
5|$|The {{final draft}} of Compton's November 1941 report {{made no mention}} of using plutonium, but after {{discussing}} the latest research with Ernest Lawrence, Compton became convinced that a plutonium bomb was also feasible. In December, Compton was placed in charge of <b>the</b> <b>plutonium</b> project, which was codenamed X-10. Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate <b>the</b> <b>plutonium</b> from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb. It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs the scientists should pursue, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built. He felt that having teams at Columbia, Princeton, the University of Chicago and the University of California was creating too much duplication and not enough collaboration, and he concentrated the work at the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{that in addition to}} <b>the</b> use of <b>plutonium,</b> <b>the</b> minor actinides could be used in a critical power reactor. Tests are already being conducted in which americium is being used as a fuel.|$|R
50|$|The fission {{cross section}} for 239Pu is 747.9 barns for thermal neutrons, while the {{activation}} cross section is 270.7 barns (the ratio approximates to 11 fissions for every 4 neutron captures). <b>The</b> higher <b>plutonium</b> isotopes are created when the uranium fuel {{is used for}} a long time.

5|$|A major {{crisis for}} <b>the</b> <b>plutonium</b> program {{occurred}} in July 1943, when Emilio Segrè's group confirmed that plutonium {{created in the}} X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge contained high levels of plutonium-240. Its spontaneous fission ruled out the use of plutonium in a gun-type nuclear weapon. Oppenheimer's Los Alamos Laboratory met the challenge by designing and building an implosion-type nuclear weapon.|$|E

5|$|Demand {{for heavy}} water {{increased}} in the early 1950s. The heavy water facility at Wabash, now renamed the Dana Plant by the Atomic Energy Commission, was reopened, and DuPont resumed production of heavy water in May 1952. The site was used a pilot plant for a new production process using hydrogen sulphide. The heavy water facility was closed again in early 1957. The facility, and a larger complex at the Savannah River Site had fulfilled its purpose, supplying heavy water for <b>the</b> <b>plutonium</b> production reactors at Savannah River.|$|E
5|$|During World War II the U.S. {{government}} {{established the}} Manhattan Project, which was tasked with developing an atomic bomb. The three primary research and production {{sites of the}} project were <b>the</b> <b>plutonium</b> production facility at {{what is now the}} Hanford Site, the uranium enrichment facilities at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the weapons research and design laboratory, now known as Los Alamos National Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Emilio Segrè and Glenn Seaborg at the University of California {{produced}} 28 μg {{of plutonium}} in the 60-inch cyclotron there in May 1941, {{and found that}} it had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235. At the time plutonium-239 had been produced in minute quantities using cyclotrons, but {{it was not possible to}} produce large quantities that way. Compton discussed with Eugene Wigner from Princeton University how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber how <b>the</b> <b>plutonium</b> produced in a reactor might be separated from uranium.|$|E

500|$|The group {{measured}} {{the activity of}} thorium, uranium-234, uranium-235 and uranium-238, but only had access to microgram quantities of plutonium-239. [...] <b>The</b> first sample <b>plutonium</b> produced in <b>the</b> nuclear reactor at Oak Ridge was received in April 1944. Within days the group observed five {{times the rate of}} spontaneous fission as with <b>the</b> cyclotron-produced <b>plutonium.</b> [...] This was not news that the leaders of the project wanted to hear. It meant that Thin Man, <b>the</b> proposed <b>plutonium</b> gun-type nuclear weapon, would not work and implied that the project's investment in plutonium production facilities at the Hanford Site was wasted. Segrè's group carefully checked their results and concluded that the increased activity was due to the plutonium-240 isotope.|$|R

5|$|In 2004, a safe was {{discovered}} during excavations of a burial trench at the Hanford nuclear site. Inside the safe were various items, including a large glass bottle containing a whitish slurry which was subsequently {{identified as the}} oldest sample of weapons-grade plutonium known to exist.

5|$|In February 1940, Glenn Seaborg and Edwin McMillan {{produced}} plutonium-239 {{through the}} bombardment of uranium. In their experiments bombarding uranium with deuterons, they observed {{the creation of}} neptunium, element 93, which then underwent beta-decay {{to form a new}} element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Kennedy built a series of detectors and counters to verify the presence of plutonium. He used mica sliced razor thin to produce a window to count alpha particle emissions, and ionization chamber with a magnetic field to separate the beta particles from the neptunium from alpha particles from <b>the</b> <b>plutonium.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the work on uranium {{was an effort to}} produce plutonium. After the feasibility of the world's first artificial nuclear reactor was demonstrated in Chicago at the Metallurgical Laboratory, it designed the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge and the production reactors in Hanford, Washington, in which uranium was irradiated and transmuted into plutonium. <b>The</b> <b>plutonium</b> was then chemically separated from the uranium.
