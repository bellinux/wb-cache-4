Since any early repayments are passed on to this class, it means the other investors have a more predictable cash flow.|$|E
25|$|CRAs are {{not only}} paid for giving ratings to {{structured}} securities, but may be paid for {{advice on how to}} structure tranches and sometimes <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> that secure the debt to achieve ratings the issuer desires. This involves back and forth interaction and analysis between the sponsor of the trust that issues the security and the rating agency. During this process, the sponsor may submit proposed structures to the agency for analysis and feedback until the sponsor is satisfied with the ratings of the different tranches.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court did {{not rule}} that all income taxes were direct taxes. Instead, the Court held that {{although}} generally income taxes are indirect taxes (excises) authorized by the United States Constitution in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 1, taxes on interest, dividends and rents in the 1894 Act {{had a profound effect}} on <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>assets.</b> The Court ruled that the tax on dividends, interest and rent should be viewed as a direct tax, as they fell on the property itself, rather than as an indirect tax. Direct taxes were required to follow the rule of apportionment found in Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3.|$|E
50|$|For example, a {{position}} which is long a 60-strike call and short a 60-strike put will always result in purchasing <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> for 60 at exercise or expiration. If <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> is above 60, the call {{is in the}} money and will be exercised; if <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> is below 60 then the short put position will be assigned, resulting in a (forced) purchase of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> at 60.|$|R
50|$|A reverse {{version of}} this {{strategy}} also exists. This is when a trader believes that the futures contract is undervalued and <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> overvalued. Instead of shorting the futures contract the trader would long this, and short <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset.</b>|$|R
50|$|The put buyer/owner {{is short}} on <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> of <b>the</b> put, but {{long on the}} put option itself. That is, the buyer wants {{the value of the}} put option to {{increase}} by a decline in the price of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> below <b>the</b> strike price. The writer (seller) of a put is long on <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> and short on the put option itself. That is, the seller wants the option to become worthless by an increase in the price of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> above <b>the</b> strike price. Generally, a put option that is purchased is referred to as a long put and a put option that is sold is referred to as a short put.|$|R
25|$|ETF {{distributors}} only {{buy or sell}} ETFs {{directly from}} or to authorized participants, which are large broker-dealers with whom they have entered into agreements—and then, only in creation units, which are large blocks {{of tens of thousands}} of ETF shares, usually exchanged in-kind with baskets of the underlying securities. Authorized participants may wish to invest in the ETF shares for the long-term, but they usually act as market makers on the open market, using their ability to exchange creation units with their underlying securities to provide liquidity of the ETF shares and help ensure that their intraday market price approximates the net asset value of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>assets.</b> Other investors, such as individuals using a retail broker, trade ETF shares on this secondary market.|$|E
25|$|Expiry (or Expiration in the U.S.) is {{the time}} and the day that a {{particular}} delivery month of a futures contract stops trading, as well as the final settlement price for that contract. For many equity index and Interest rate future contracts (as well as for most equity options), this happens on the third Friday of certain trading months. On this day the t+1 futures contract becomes the t futures contract. For example, for most CME and CBOT contracts, at the expiration of the December contract, the March futures become the nearest contract. This is an exciting time for arbitrage desks, which try to make quick profits during the short period (perhaps 30 minutes) during which the underlying cash price and the futures price sometimes struggle to converge. At this moment the futures and <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> are extremely liquid and any disparity between an index and an underlying asset is quickly traded by arbitrageurs. At this moment also, the increase in volume is caused by traders rolling over positions to the next contract or, in the case of equity index futures, purchasing underlying components of those indexes to hedge against current index positions. On the expiry date, a European equity arbitrage trading desk in London or Frankfurt will see positions expire in as many as eight major markets almost every half an hour.|$|E

The computed bounds from real data show that the gap between the {{upper and lower bounds}} is large near <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> price but gets smaller away from <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> price. Since <b>the</b> bounds can be easily computed and visualized, they could be practically used by investors in vari-ous ways...|$|R
50|$|From the {{economic}} point of view, financial derivatives are cash flows, that are conditioned stochastically and discounted to present value. The market risk inherent in <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> {{is attached to}} the financial derivative through contractual agreements and hence can be traded separately. <b>The</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> {{does not have to be}} acquired. Derivatives therefore allow the breakup of ownership and participation in the market value of an asset. This also provides a considerable amount of freedom regarding the contract design. That contractual freedom allows to modify the participation in the performance of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> almost arbitrarily. Thus, the participation in the market value of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> can be effectively weaker, stronger (leverage effect), or implemented as inverse. Hence, specifically the market price risk of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> can be controlled in almost every situation.|$|R

2500|$|The monthly {{payments}} from <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> – loans or receivables – typically consist of principal and interest, with principal being scheduled or unscheduled. The cash flows produced by <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> can be allocated to investors in different ways. Cash flows {{can be directly}} passed through to investors after administrative fees are subtracted, thus creating a “pass-through” security; alternatively, cash flows can be carved up according to specified rules and market demand, thus creating [...] "structured" [...] securities." ...|$|E
2500|$|Often a {{separate}} institution, called a special purpose vehicle, is created {{to handle the}} securitization of asset backed securities. [...] The special purpose vehicle, which creates and sells the securities, uses the {{proceeds of the sale}} to pay back the bank that created, or originated, <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>assets.</b> [...] The special purpose vehicle is responsible for [...] "bundling" [...] <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> into a specified pool that will fit the risk preferences and other needs of investors who might want to buy the securities, for managing credit risk – often by transferring it to an insurance company after paying a premium – and for distributing payments from the securities. [...] As long as the credit risk of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> is transferred to another institution, the originating bank removes the value of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> from its balance sheet and receives cash in return as the asset backed securities are sold, a transaction which can improve its credit rating and reduce the amount of capital that it needs. [...] In this case, a credit rating of the asset backed securities would be based only on the assets and liabilities of the special purpose vehicle, and this rating could be higher than if the originating bank issued the securities because the risk of the asset backed securities would no longer be associated with other risks that the originating bank might bear. [...] A higher credit rating could allow the special purpose vehicle and, by extension, the originating institution to pay a lower interest rate (and hence, charge a higher price) on the asset-backed securities than if the originating institution borrowed funds or issued bonds.|$|E

40|$|We {{compare the}} state-price density that is {{implied by the}} {{cross-section}} of options prices with the corresponding density of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> price that is derived from an equilibrium model with Markovian stochastic volatility. If the data-generating process is of the stochastic volatility type and if options are correctly priced, the two densities should be identical. Such work has been motivated by the negative results obtained by Aðt-Sahalia, Wang and Yard (1998) {{in the case of}} a simple, complete-markets setting in which the volatility of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> price only depended on <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> price. ...|$|R
40|$|We derive super-replicating bounds on European option prices when <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> is illiquid. Illiquidity {{is taken}} as the impossibility of {{transacting}} <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> at some points in time, generating market incompleteness. We conclude that option price bounds follow a Black-Scholes partial differential equation where the volatility term is adjusted to reflect different levels of illiquidity. ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{investment}} in PARs {{may result in}} a loss. Investing in PARs involves risks similar to investing directly in <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset,</b> including a risk of a loss in the investment. Because the value of the PAR {{is directly related to the}} level of a particular <b>underlying</b> <b>asset,</b> an {{investment in}} the Notes {{may result in a}} loss to the investor if the level of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> declines.|$|R
2500|$|A {{controlled}} amortization structure {{can give}} investors a more predictable repayment schedule, even though <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> may be nonamortising. After a predetermined [...] "revolving period", during which only interest payments are made, these securitizations attempt to return principal to investors {{in a series}} of defined periodic payments, usually within a year. An early amortization event is the risk of the debt being retired early.|$|E
2500|$|If <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> are {{mortgages}} or loans, {{there are}} usually two separate [...] "waterfalls" [...] because the principal and interest receipts can be easily allocated and matched. But if the assets are income-based transactions such as rental deals one cannot categorise the revenue so easily between income and principal repayment. In this case all the revenue is used to pay the cash flows due on the bonds as those cash flows become due.|$|E
2500|$|Earnings: Securitization {{makes it}} {{possible}} to record an earnings bounce without any real addition to the firm. [...] When a securitization takes place, there often is a [...] "true sale" [...] that takes place between the Originator (the parent company) and the SPE. [...] This sale has to be for the market value of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> for the [...] "true sale" [...] to stick and thus this sale is reflected on the parent company's balance sheet, which will boost earnings for that quarter by the amount of the sale. [...] While not illegal in any respect, this does distort the true earnings of the parent company.|$|E
50|$|However downstream, in {{the back}} office, {{difficulties}} can arise from failure to appropriately control the risks associated {{from the lack of}} data and compatibility of accounting platforms. The issue stems from the bespoke nature of the CLN in that it is priced in USD but <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> is denominated in another currency. Secondly, the sell side may price the CLN based on the issued asset in USD. This in turn does not appropriately reflect the Yield to Maturity of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> as it approaches par value at maturity. Thirdly, <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>asset</b> may be inflation linked, or have periodic paydowns that compound the first and third issues mentioned before.|$|R

2500|$|An asset-backed {{security}} (ABS) is {{a security}} whose income payments and hence value {{are derived from}} and collateralized (or [...] "backed") by a specified pool of underlying assets. The pool of assets is typically a group of small and illiquid assets which are unable to be sold individually. Pooling the assets into financial instruments allows them {{to be sold to}} general investors, a process called [...] securitization, and allows the risk of investing in <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> to be diversified because each security will represent a fraction of the total value of the diverse pool of underlying assets. The pools of underlying assets can include common payments from credit cards, auto loans, and mortgage loans, to esoteric cash flows from aircraft leases, royalty payments and movie revenues.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2010, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Goldman Sachs {{and one of}} its vice-presidents, Fabrice Tourre, with {{securities}} fraud.

In fact, Paulson & Co. a hedge fund that wanted to bet against the investment had played a [...] "significant role" [...] in the selection, and the package of securities turned out to become [...] "one of the worst-performing mortgage deals of the housing crisis" [...] because [...] "less than a year after the deal was completed, 100% of the bonds selected for Abacus had been downgraded".|$|E
2500|$|Off balance sheet: Derivative (finance) of {{many types}} {{have in the}} past been {{referred}} to as [...] "off-balance-sheet." [...] This term implies that the use of derivatives has no balance sheet impact. While there are differences among the various accounting standards internationally, there is a general trend towards the requirement to record derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet. There is also a generally accepted principle that, where derivatives are being used as a hedge against underlying assets or liabilities, accounting adjustments are required to ensure that the gain/loss on the hedged instrument is recognized in the income statement on a similar basis as <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>assets</b> and liabilities. Certain credit derivatives products, particularly Credit Default Swaps, now have more or less universally accepted market standard documentation. In the case of Credit Default Swaps, this documentation has been formulated by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) who have for a long time provided documentation on how to treat such derivatives on balance sheets.|$|E
