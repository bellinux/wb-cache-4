40|$|Tax {{burden on}} small {{business}} owners in the United States is significant and regressive in nature. Some studies have linked the tax burden on {{small business owners}} to lower profitability, lower rate of entrepreneurial growth, and business closures. The tax burden also appears to cause some small business owners to resort to bankruptcy protection. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the burden tax obligations impose on small business owners at the time of their bankruptcy filing. Specifically, using a national sample, this study ascertains the pervasiveness of <b>tax</b> <b>debts</b> among small business owner bankruptcy petitioners. The findings from this study suggest that the tax burden is pervasive to a much greater extent among small business owners in bankruptcy as compared to consumer petitioners. This study also suggests that individual small business owners, who are encumbered with high <b>tax</b> <b>debts,</b> are significantly worse off financially as compared to the small business owners who have low <b>tax</b> <b>debts</b> or no <b>tax</b> <b>debts.</b> This study indicates that the tax burden is also significant in total amount outstanding. Not only did a sizable number of small business owners in bankruptcy sample report significant <b>tax</b> <b>debts</b> as part of their bankruptcy schedules, <b>tax</b> <b>debts</b> appear to impair the ability of some small business owners from obtaining a financial fresh start...|$|R

25|$|Although Hitler {{originally}} wrote Mein Kampf {{mostly for}} {{the followers of}} National Socialism, it grew in popularity after he rose to power. (Two other books written by party members, Gottfried Feder's Breaking The Interest Slavery and Alfred Rosenberg's The Myth of the Twentieth Century, have since lapsed into comparative literary obscurity, and no translation of Feder's book from the original German is known.) Hitler had made about 1.2 million Reichsmarks from the income of the book by 1933, when the average annual income of a teacher was about 4,800 Marks. He accumulated a <b>tax</b> <b>debt</b> of 405,500 Reichsmark (very roughly in 2015 1.1 million GBP, 1.4 million EUR, 1.5 million USD) {{from the sale of}} about 240,000 copies before he became chancellor in 1933 (at which time his debt was waived).|$|E

25|$|In April 1874, Robert E. and Mary Lee's eldest son, George Washington Custis Lee, petitioned Congress {{for payment}} for the Arlington estate. Lee argued that tax sale of the entire {{property}} (rather than just that portion needed to pay the <b>tax</b> <b>debt)</b> amounted to confiscation and was unconstitutional. He also argued that the tax collectors' refusal to accept payment made the proceedings null and void. Finally, he asserted {{that the federal government}} should only be able to secure a life interest in the property (in other words, seize it only as long as Mary Lee lived) and could not assert title to the estate without the consent of the state of Virginia. He offered not to litigate the seizure of Arlington if paid. Lee's petition was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary on April 6, but it was not acted on.|$|E

With the exception of Rubén Beraja (who is Jewish), the chairmen involved in each of these bank collapses were members of the right-wing Roman Catholic group, Opus Dei.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} of this largesse and government intervention eventually put Louis in severe financial straits. His entrusting of his finances to former manager Mike Jacobs haunted him. After the $500,000 IRS tax bill was assessed, with interest accumulating every year, {{the need for}} cash precipitated Louis's post-retirement comeback. Even though his comeback earned him significant purses, the incremental tax rate {{in place at the}} time (90%) meant that these boxing proceeds did not even keep pace with interest on Louis's <b>tax</b> <b>debt.</b> As a result, {{by the end of the}} 1950s, he owed over $1 million in taxes and interest. In 1953, when Louis's mother died, the IRS appropriated the $667 she had willed to Louis. To bring in money, Louis engaged in numerous activities outside the ring. He appeared on various quiz shows, and an old Army buddy, Ash Resnick, gave Louis a job greeting tourists to the Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas, where Resnick was an executive. For income, Louis even became a professional wrestler. He made his professional wrestling debut on March 16, 1956 in Washington, D.C., defeating Cowboy Rocky Lee. After defeating Lee in a few matches, Louis discovered he had a heart ailment and retired from wrestling competition. However, he continued as a wrestling referee until 1972.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{empirical}} literature has long struggled {{to identify the}} impact of taxes on corporate financial structure, a recent boom in studies offers ample support for the debt bias of taxation. Yet, studies differ considerably in effect size and reveal an equally large variety in methodologies and specifications. This paper sheds light on this variation and assesses the systematic impact {{on the size of}} the effects. We find that, typically, a one percentage point higher tax rate increases the debt-asset ratio by between 0. 17 and 0. 28. Responses are increasing over time, which suggests that debt bias distortions have become more important.

25|$|A {{court and}} the judges may not impose a fine and place a {{defendant}} on probation if the offense is punishable by fine or imprisonment. However, probation as to one count can be conditioned on payment of fine imposed under another count. If a defendant is unable to pay fees, revocation of probation for nonpayment is considered unconstitutional. But an income tax evasion defendant ordered {{to cooperate with the}} Collector of Internal Revenue in determining the amount of tax due and pay that amount could be subjected to revocation of probation if he failed to, in good faith, pay what he could on taxes, but instead concealed and fraudulently transferred assets. In a case in which a defendant was ordered to pay $1,500 in back taxes within 24 hours of sentencing, the appellate court ruled that this was acceptable since the defendant had plenty of time between conviction and sentencing in which {{to take care of his}} <b>tax</b> <b>debt.</b> In the United States, it has been ruled that probationers have no First Amendment right to avoid federal income taxes on religious grounds. Probationers are required to obey the law; tax resistance is illegal; therefore, by syllogism, probationers cannot engage in tax resistance.|$|E

How much of this debt would be suitable to report to credit bureaus could depend on the purpose of the reporting proposal, such as to collect more debts or simply to inform other potential creditors of the existence of <b>tax</b> <b>debts.</b> Most of debts were relatively small in size. Well over half of individuals and businesses with <b>tax</b> <b>debts</b> owed less than $ 5, 000. However, much of the aggregate debt is concentrated among those owing relatively large amounts. Debts over $ 25, 000 add up to a total of $ 310 billion. Some debts were in the collection process where the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) notifies the taxpayer of the debt and were subject to dispute by the taxpayer, while other debts were covered by installment agreements [...] about $ 60 billion of the debts owed were in these two categories. About $ 110 billion of the total debt was classified by IRS as uncollectable.

Previous problems we identified with contractors with unpaid taxes have led to concerns over whether any interagency contractors, such as those on the General Services Administration's (GSA) federal supply schedule, failed to pay their taxes. GSA, through its federal supply schedule and other interagency contracts, arranges for federal agencies to purchase {{billions of dollars of}} goods and services directly from private vendors. GAO was asked to determine if GSA contractors, including both contractors that were paid by GSA and GSA interagency contractors, have unpaid federal taxes, and if so, to (1) determine the magnitude of <b>tax</b> <b>debts</b> owed by GSA contractors; (2) identify examples of GSA contractors that have <b>tax</b> <b>debts</b> and are also engaged in potentially abusive, fraudulent, or criminal activities; and (3) determine whether GSA screens contractors for <b>tax</b> <b>debts</b> and criminal activities prior to awarding contracts and at the exercise of any government contract options. ...|$|R
