40|$|In this paper, I present {{computational}} {{procedures to}} obtian statistical <b>tables.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tables</b> of <b>the</b> asymptotic distribution and the exact distribution of Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic D_n for one population, <b>the</b> <b>table</b> of <b>the</b> {{distribution of the}} runs R, <b>the</b> <b>table</b> of <b>the</b> distribution of Wilcoxon signed-rank statistic W^+ and <b>the</b> <b>table</b> of <b>the</b> distribution of Mann-Whitney statistic U_x using Mathematica, Version 3. 9 under Window 98. I {{think that it is}} an interesting cuestion because many statistical packages give the asymptotic significance level in the statistical tests and with these porcedures one can easily calculate the exact significance levels and the left-tail and right-tail probabilities with non-parametric distributions. I have used mathematica to make these calculations because one can use symbolic language to solve recursion relations. It's very easy to generate the format of <b>the</b> <b>tables,</b> and it's possible to obtain any <b>table</b> of <b>the</b> mentioned non-parametric distributions with any precision, not only with the standard parameters more used in Statistics, and without transcription mistakes. Furthermore, using similar procedures, we can generate <b>tables</b> for <b>the</b> following distribution functions: Binomial, Poisson, Hypergeometric, Normal, x^ 2 Chi-Square, T-Student, F-Snedecor, Geometric, Gamma and Beta. ...|$|R
