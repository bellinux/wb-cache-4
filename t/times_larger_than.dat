5|$|Most cnidarians prey on organisms {{ranging in}} size from {{plankton}} to animals several <b>times</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> themselves, but many obtain much of their nutrition from dinoflagellates, and a few are parasites. Many are preyed on by other animals including starfish, sea slugs, fish, turtles, and even other cnidarians. Many scleractinian corals—which form the structural foundation for coral reefs—possess polyps that are filled with symbiotic photo-synthetic zooxanthellae. While reef-forming corals are almost entirely restricted to warm and shallow marine waters, other cnidarians can be found at great depths, in polar regions, and in freshwater.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before it}} becomes a red giant, the {{luminosity}} of the Sun will have nearly doubled, and Earth will receive as much sunlight as Venus receives today. Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years, the Sun will expand into a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over about half a billion years. It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred <b>times</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> today {{and a couple of}} thousand times more luminous. This then starts the red-giant-branch phase where the Sun will spend around a billion years and lose around a third of its mass.|$|E

5|$|George and {{his father}} sailed for England from The Hague on 16/27 September 1714 and arrived at Greenwich two days later. The {{following}} day, they formally entered London in a ceremonial procession. George was given the title of Prince of Wales. Caroline followed her husband to Britain in October with their daughters, while Frederick remained in Hanover to be brought up by private tutors. London was like nothing George had seen before: it was 50 <b>times</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> Hanover, and the crowd was estimated at up to {{one and a half}} million spectators. George courted popularity with voluble expressions of praise for the English, and claimed that he had no drop of blood that was not English.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} prevents the solar wind, {{a stream of}} ionized particles emitted by the Sun, from interacting directly with its atmosphere, and instead diverts {{it away from the}} planet, effectively creating a cavity in the solar wind flow, called a magnetosphere, composed of a plasma {{different from that of the}} solar wind. The Jovian (i.e. pertaining to Jupiter) magnetosphere is so large that the Sun and its visible corona would fit inside it with room to spare. If one could see it from Earth, it would appear five <b>times</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the full moon in the sky despite being nearly 1700 times farther away.|$|E
5|$|Ocean tides are {{converted}} to heat by frictional {{losses in the}} oceans and their interaction with the solid bottom and with the top ice crust. In late 2008, it was suggested Jupiter may keep Europa's oceans warm by generating large planetary tidal waves on Europa because of its small but non-zero obliquity. This generates so-called Rossby waves that travel quite slowly, at just a few kilometers per day, but can generate significant kinetic energy. For the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree, the resonance from Rossby waves would contain 7.3 J of kinetic energy, which is two thousand <b>times</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> that of the flow excited by the dominant tidal forces. Dissipation of this energy could be the principal heat source of Europa's ocean.|$|E

The village was at one <b>time</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> Miami, due to the phosphate mining industry located in Citrus County. Around the time of World War I, the mining industry shut down in Floral City. After the war, mining was moved south to the Bartow area east of Tampa.|$|R

Some cnidarians are parasites, mainly on jellyfish {{but a few}} are major pests of fish. Others obtain most of their nourishment from endosymbiotic algae or dissolved nutrients. Predators of cnidarians include: sea slugs, which can incorporate nematocysts into their own bodies for self-defense; starfish, notably the crown of thorns starfish, which can devastate corals; butterfly fish and parrot fish, which eat corals; and marine turtles, which eat jellyfish. Some sea anemones and jellyfish have a symbiotic relationship with some fish; for example clown fish live among the tentacles of sea anemones, and each partner protects the other against predators.|$|E
5|$|The ice {{crystals}} in cirrus clouds have different shapes {{in addition to}} different sizes. Some shapes include solid columns, hollow columns, plates, rosettes, and conglomerations of the various other types.

Cirrus in temperate regions typically have the shapes segregated by type: the columns and plates tend to {{be at the top of}} the cloud, whereas the rosettes and conglomerations tend to be near the base. In the northern Arctic region, cirrus tend to be composed of only the columns, plates, and conglomerations, and these crystals tend to be at least four <b>times</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the minimum size. In Antarctica, cirrus are usually composed of only the columns, and these columns are much longer than normal.|$|E

Maxentius' strongest supporters in the military were neutralized when the Praetorian Guard and Imperial Horse Guard (equites singulares) were disbanded. The tombstones of the Imperial Horse Guard were ground up and put to use in a basilica on the Via Labicana. On November 9, 312AD, barely two weeks after Constantine captured the city, the former base of the Imperial Horse Guard was chosen for redevelopment into the Lateran Basilica. The Legio II Parthica was removed from Alba (Albano Laziale), and the remainder of Maxentius' armies were sent to do frontier duty on the Rhine.|$|E
