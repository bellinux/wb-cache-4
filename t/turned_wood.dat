Based on the {{extensive}} woodland {{resources of the}} area (principally alder and beech), the milling and turning of wood was the town's most prominent industry in the 19th century. The Crimean War contracts for supplying the army with lance poles and tent pegs led to major expansion. The largest manufacturer was East & Sons.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1966 {{report to}} the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission, Raymond Girvigian, the {{chairman}} of the historic buildings committee of the Southern California chapter of the American Institute of Architects said:This residence, purchased by James and Bessie Hale about 1901, is a wood frame structure having exterior clapboard siding accented with fish scale shingles and cast plaster ornament around the main, east facade windows and pediments. [...] Other notable features include a veranda at the northeast corner having <b>turned</b> <b>wood</b> posts with curved wood bracket caps and milled ballusters and an ornamental iron rail on its roof. [...] It has brick chimneys with incised geometric detail and corbelled projections at top and a second floor turret window at the southeast corner, also curved wood brackets at the second floor cornice.|$|E

[...] The richly {{decorated}} interior follows the descriptions in the historic inventories of the 1830s. [...] The crystal chandeliers are copies of period pieces similar to ones listed in the old church inventories. Two of the original statues have been placed on the two side altars. Ecce Homo, a figure of Christ clothed in a scarlet robe and crowned with thorns, stands on a balcony above one of the side altars. The other statue of Saint Bonaventure was carved from wood and then painted. The original baptismal font of hammered copper on a <b>turned</b> <b>wood</b> base has been returned to the church, as has the bell wheel used by the Ohlones during the sacred parts of the Mass.|$|E

60|$|We {{kept the}} valley of the glorified stream till the waters sank out of sight down the cliff side and we could but hear them calling to one another through the tangle of the trees. Where the {{woodlands}} were lovelier, the gorge deepest, and the colours of the young hornbeam most tender, they had clapped down two vile hostelries of wood and glass, and a village that lived by selling <b>turned</b> <b>wood</b> and glass inlay things to the tourist.|$|E
60|$|We had {{expected}} to stay in Boston only until we could find a house in Old Cambridge. This was not so simple a matter as it might seem; for the ancient town had not yet quickened its scholarly pace to the modern step. Indeed, {{in the spring of}} 1866 the impulse of expansion was not yet visibly felt anywhere; the enormous material growth that followed the civil war had not yet begun. In Cambridge the houses to be let were few, and such as there were fell either below our pride or rose above our purse. I wish I might tell how at last we bought a house; we had no money, but we were rich in friends, who are still alive to shrink from the story of their constant faith in a financial future which we sometimes doubted, and who backed their credulity with their credit. It is sufficient for the present record, which professes to be strictly literary, to notify the fact that {{on the first day of}} May, 1866, we went out to Cambridge and began to live in a house which we owned in fee if not in deed, and which was none the less valuable for being covered with mortgages. Physically, it was a carpenter's box, of a sort which is readily imagined by the Anglo-American genius for ugliness, but which it is not so easy to impart a just conception of. A trim hedge of arbor- vita; tried to hide it from the world in front, and a tall board fence behind; the little lot was well planted (perhaps too well planted) with pears, grapes, and currants, and there was a small open space which I lost no time in digging up for a kitchen-garden. On one side of us were the open fields; on the other a brief line of neighbor-houses; across the street before us was a grove of stately oaks, which I never could persuade Aldrich had painted leaves on them in the fall. We were really in a poor suburb of a suburb; but such is the fascination of ownership, even the ownership of a fully mortgaged property, that we calculated the latitude and longitude of the whole earth from the spot we called ours. In our walks about Cambridge we saw other places where we might have been willing to live; only, we said, they were too far off: We even prized the architecture of our little box, though we had but so lately lived in a Gothic palace on the Grand Canal in Venice, and were not uncritical of beauty in the possessions of others. Positive beauty we could not have honestly said we thought our cottage had as a whole, though we might have held out for something of the kind in the brackets of <b>turned</b> <b>wood</b> under its eaves. But we were richly content with it; and with life in Cambridge, as it began to open itself to us, we were infinitely more than content. This life, so refined, so intelligent, so gracefully simple, I do not suppose has anywhere else had its parallel.|$|E
5000|$|Green or wet <b>turning</b> - <b>turning</b> <b>wood</b> {{while its}} {{moisture}} content is above equilibrium. Often done when the wood is newly felled. May be turned to finished thickness, {{in which case}} the differential shrinkage of the wood will result in a finished piece that is not perfectly round. Alternatively, it may be [...] "rough turned". Rough turning involves turning the piece only to its general shape, leaving enough thickness so that after turning it can be allowed to dry to equilibrium moisture content and distort. The advantage over first drying the <b>wood</b> then <b>turning</b> is that a rough turned piece dries faster, will probably distort instead of split as solid wood tends to, and that wet <b>wood</b> <b>turns</b> better, since it creates less dust. Rough turning is inexact science: <b>turning</b> <b>wood</b> too thick will lead to splits, <b>turning</b> <b>wood</b> too thin will lead to distortion that cannot be removed, because not enough thickness is left. Once dry, it is mounted on the lathe a second time and turned to its final form. Rough turning is typically used on most functional work and some artistic pieces.|$|R

5000|$|Both {{strength}} {{and weight loss}} occur with white rot decay, causing the 'punky' area often referred to by woodworkers.
