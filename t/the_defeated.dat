40|$|Social agonistic {{behaviour}} of intact male rats {{is strongly}} reduced by <b>the</b> experience of <b>defeat</b> by a dominant male conspecific. Small electrolytic lesions in the corticomedial amygdala strongly affected this behavioural change due to defeat.

A comparison {{of the effects of}} lesions made before <b>the</b> <b>defeat</b> with lesions made after <b>the</b> <b>defeat</b> revealed that <b>the</b> lesions primarily produce a retention deficit in social learning. ...|$|R

A kneeling woman clutches the waist of the victorious soldier, raising her face to him to beg him to spare his defeated foe. <b>The</b> <b>defeated</b> warrior has a stronger body, a face more in keeping with the conventions of attractiveness at the time, and a more sympathetic expression, while the victorious man is darker skinned and has an expression of blank fierceness. The vanquished soldier's sword has broken, and lies beside him on the ground.|$|E
