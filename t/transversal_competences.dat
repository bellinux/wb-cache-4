40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide {{guidelines}} for reflection and improvement of <b>transversal</b> <b>competences</b> of teachers in the field of self-regulation, education for sustainable development and inclusion in the context of their continuing professional development. Also, the moderatory effect of personality based on literature analysis and insight into empirical results will be demonstrated. Teachers ’ reputation determines the framework of their professional development and is strongly influenced by social challenges, globalization, integration, sustainability, technological development, etc. In addition, a strongly biologically determined teacher’s personality significantly moderates the relationship of their professional development and <b>transversal</b> <b>competences.</b> <b>Transversal</b> <b>competences</b> are recognized as the teachers ’ important skills in their organization of the teaching and learning process and their professional development, as well as in the process of them teaching these competences to their students. “Learning to learn ” is recognized as the key lifelong learning competence in the European policy documents and the environmental and sustainability issues are some of the most common transversal themes of the general education curricula.

40|$|The {{contemporary}} socio-cultural {{and educational}} situation points {{the attention to}} the analysis and construction of opportunities for the formation and development of <b>transversal</b> <b>competences</b> in school education. It is expedient therefore that within the process of education in all school subjects and throughout all ages and cognitive activities the decisions {{for the design of}} a suitable educational environment should be systematized and specified {{in such a way as}} to guarantee that knowledge and skills can be continuously regrouped in accordance with context. In other words, these skills and the knowledge they are based on, should form the foundation of <b>transversal</b> <b>competences</b> that can be applied regardless of age and activities. The design of invariant technologies for the development of <b>transversal</b> <b>competences</b> is also related to the coordination of a variety of approaches, principles and conditions of education in such a manner as to provide effectiveness when these technologies are specifically applied as variants. This creates a necessity for a didactic interpretation of the means of development of <b>transversal</b> <b>competences.</b> Additionally, it poses a necessity to improve teachers’ special preparation and qualification to design educational environment that can guarantee the achievement of <b>transversal</b> <b>competences</b> as an educational outcome. The present research offers opportunities to realize this goal in an integrative and integrating process rather than as an isolated endevour on part of the teachers or as an unorganized effort on part of the students.

40|$|Abstract – A {{competence}} may be generically {{defined as}} the capacity of doing something and {{is more than just}} skills or knowledge. A <b>transversal</b> <b>competence</b> is one which can be re-used when shifting to another context. Our goal is to contribute to improve Computer Science 1 (CS 1) course’s results by the systematic incorporation of activities based on transversal competencies. We designed a set of activities to enhance the development of transversal competencies, specially planning and time management, team work and communication skills. Hypothetically, we propose that including this kind of activities helps to obtain better results in the course. An initial experimentation was done in 2010. The preliminary results show a remarkable positive difference in student’s results. In the selected group the fail rate was only 12 % (3 of 25 students). In other groups, the fail rate was 32 % (8 of 25 students) and 40 % (8 of 20 students). In previous years, this rate was approximately 40 %...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{introduce}} a case study carried out by a multidisciplinary teaching team who has studied, at the UPCT, the mechanisms for a progressive implementation of academic English in its schools, with the final purpose of achieving a bilingual teaching model. In a first theoretical stage, we explain how the teaching team focuses on the available concepts and theories concerned with languages for specific purposes, together with Bologna’s guidelines about English as a <b>transversal</b> <b>competence</b> in all Higher Education institutions. Likewise, the team revises the level of implementation of academic bilingual programs in our surrounding countries. Later, the article describes the elaboration process of several materials by the teaching team, in which all the faculty of the UPCT has been involved. Such materials have finally led to the design of a training course for those lecturers who have introduced or are going to introduce English, partly or wholly, in the content subjects of their respective degrees, thus contributing to strengthening the presence of languages for specific purposes in our academic environment...|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{the issue}} of how a common {{framework}} of language teacher education can be applied to diverse contexts as a frame of reference is identified as a problematic domain. Participants argue that, content-wise, such a framework (e.g., EPLTE) runs the risk of being considered too general or even vague when addressing overall issues. Participants suggest a closer focus on <b>transversal</b> language <b>competences</b> and ways of conveying such integrated competences. Other areas under discussion include a focus on curricula integrated multiple languages, contrastive grammar, or devices for the learning of languages in a multilingual context.|$|R
40|$|Finnish basic {{education}} faces {{a significant change}} with the 2016 commissioning of the renewed core curriculum, which introduces a new <b>transversal</b> <b>competence,</b> termed multiliteracies — a concept closely related to media literacy. This systematic literature review examines the research literature on media literacy and multiliteracies, analysing and comparing the nature of knowledge constructed and the varying definitions of the two concepts. Previous review articles (Marten 2010; Potter 2010) found little consensus among scholars regarding the definition of media literacy. This review examines the research literature published in international peer-reviewed academic journals between 2010 and 2014 to investigate whether a mutual understanding of the concept has since been established. The article argues that significant differences exist between the concepts of media literacy and multiliteracies and, further, that Finnish core curriculum defines multiliteracies differently than the research literature defines the term. In line with previous research, this article finds no consensus on the definition of media literacy in the research literature. Based on the multifaceted nature of the concept, this article rejects attempts to establish a universal definition of media literacy and presents a theoretical framework for conceptualising media literacies based on their abstraction levels. The article aims to facilitate understanding of the concept and its operationalisation in research and practice and discusses future opportunities for research on media literacy and multiliteracies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{engineering}} professional profiles {{have been}} discussed by several branches of the engineering field. On the one hand, this discussion helps to understand the professional practice and contributes to the specification of the competences that are suitable for each function and company culture. On the other hand, it is an essential {{starting point for the}} definition of curricula in engineering schools. Thus, this study aims to characterize, in an innovative way based on job advertisements, the demand for competences and areas of practice for Industrial Engineering and Management contributing for the definition of a professional profile. This characterization is based on the analysis of 1391 job advertisements, collected during seven years from a Portuguese newspaper. The data analysis takes into account the job description in which two categories were considered: areas of professional practice (e. g. project management) and <b>transversal</b> <b>competences</b> (e. g. teamwork). Considering the total number of job advertisements, it was possible to identify 1, 962 cumulative references for 11 professional practice areas and 5, 261 cumulative references for <b>transversal</b> <b>competences.</b> The contribution of this study lies on the identification of the main areas of practice and the main <b>transversal</b> <b>competences</b> demanded by employers...|$|E

The recent financial crisis has focused our attention more {{on the importance of}} ethics in business and management. EntreComp, the European Commission Competence Framework (2016) defines entrepreneurship as a <b>transversal</b> <b>competence.</b> The research question has to do with whether the European Commission is right in proposing ethical and sustainable thinking as an entrepreneurial competence. What support is there in the literature for putting forward an ethical mindset as important for the entrepreneur? The paper suggests that in the light of developments in the economy, technology, legislation and other developments, the European Commission is justified in putting forward ethical and sustainable thinking as an entrepreneurial competence. The foundation and driving force for sustainability rests on ethical foundations, as well as entrepreneurial engagement. The positive contribution of a sustainable approach to business is highlighted. This paper has implications for policy, training, educators {{as well as for the}} field of ethics in business. In relation to sustainability, effective management encompasses how business affects human development and looking at sustainability “through a holistic view of its economic, social and environmental dimensions. This means seeking not only economic results but also positive impacts on society and the environment” (Mele, 2012, p. 12) ...|$|R

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{changes of}} the European Higher Education Area is the {{implementation}} of a competence-based educational system. Students are now more than ever the axis around which the university system orbits. The competences that students should acquire during their studies include <b>transversal</b> <b>competences,</b> which are those competences related to leadership skills, problem solving, and teamwork, highly valued by labor market. This is particularly important in engineering, as these skills can influence the selection of one candidate over another. So, the evaluation and teaching of these kinds of competences are now some of the main challenges facing university professors as the corresponding learning objectives need to be set and assessed, both for study programs as well as for each individual subject, and this process is new for teachers.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} role {{of engineering}} in modern societies demands not only technically specialized engineers, but also global cultural cognizance, {{personal and professional}} ethics, together with sound transversal skills and responsiveness for sustainability issues. An enriching learning context provides engineering students with opportunities to proactively seek knowledge and technical proficiency at their unique pace, and monitor and master their own learning process. Active Learning undoubtedly enables an enriching learning context, where technical and <b>transversal</b> <b>competences</b> can be widely exercised and developed.

40|$|During {{the last}} few years the change of the school and how the school should change in the first place to meet the {{challenges}} of the future have been discussed a great deal. The talk has begun of the crossdisciplinary competences, referred to also as <b>transversal</b> (generic) <b>competences</b> in the curriculum, and of developing teaching towards the integrated modules called multidisciplinary learning modules in the reformed curriculum of the basic education. The multidisciplinary learning modules promote the reaching of the objectives set for the basic education and in particular, the development of the cross-disciplinary competences. This research was carried out in a Finnish class teachers' adult education programme during a study unit in January 2016. This study unit was a multidisciplinary learning experience, which was planned together and in which the contents of the seven different subjects taught in the comprehensive school were combined. The aim was to gain experiences of integrating the subjects, of planning and implementing learning modules, of meaningfully adapting information and communication technology as well as of collaborative learning. The research also surveys the knowledge of the concepts, which are related to the study unit. The results showed that the multidisciplinary learning module had offered meaningful experiences.
