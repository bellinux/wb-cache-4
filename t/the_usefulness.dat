The results of this research were generated using the variables - the perceived ease of use, <b>the</b> perceived <b>usefulness,</b> <b>the</b> attitude towards using, the behavioural intention to use, and the actual system usage. These variables were analysed using the Structural Equation Model (SEM). The samples of this research were 162 accounting students who were able to operate accounting software (such as MYOB and GL) at Bengkulu City, Bengkulu Province, Indonesia. The results show that the perceived ease of use had a positive significant effect on <b>the</b> perceived <b>usefulness,</b> while <b>the</b> perceived <b>usefulness</b> had a positive significant effect on the behavioural intention to use and the behavioural intention to use had a positive significant effect on the actual system usage of the accounting software...|$|R

The design of the batteries was based on the coastal batteries and entrenchments built by the Order in the 18th century, while most of the entrenchments consisted of long stretches of rubble walls. They were armed by guns taken from coastal fortifications such as Saint Mary's Tower. <b>The</b> <b>usefulness</b> of the fortifications was tested in 1799 when a French counter-attack from Fort Manoel was repelled by the insurgent batteries.|$|E

These have been successful to varying degrees.|$|E

So instead, the Great Wall became the means to limit Han Chinese movement into the steppes. In the case of Manchuria, considered to be the sacred homeland by the ruling Manchu elites, some parts of the Ming Liaodong Wall were repaired so it could serve to control Han Chinese movement into Manchuria alongside the newly erected Willow Palisade.|$|E

5|$|While Stepanov had {{originally}} intended allocators to completely encapsulate the memory model, the standards committee {{realized that this}} approach would lead to unacceptable efficiency degradations. To remedy this, additional wording {{was added to the}} allocator requirements. In particular, container implementations may assume that the allocator's type definitions for pointers and related integral types are equivalent to those provided by the default allocator, and that all instances of a given allocator type always compare equal, effectively contradicting the original design goals for allocators and limiting <b>the</b> <b>usefulness</b> of allocators that carry state.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the two {{monitors}} entered service, {{the prospect of a}} French attack had decreased, prompting the Navy to question <b>the</b> <b>usefulness</b> of retaining the vessels. As a result, they were quickly removed from service. The ultimate fate of the two ships is unclear; according to naval historian Erich Gröner, both ships were sold for 3,500gold marks in December 1875. Robert Gardiner, however, states that the ships remained, out of service, until 1884, when they were sold for scrapping. The latter version would appear to be correct, as J.F. von Kronenfels published an elevation and deckplan of Rhein in 1881, with the inference that Rhein and Mosel were still extant at that time.|$|E
