50|$|The twin-arginine {{translocation}} pathway (<b>Tat</b> <b>pathway)</b> is {{a protein}} export, or secretion pathway found in plants, bacteria, and archaea. In {{contrast to the}} Sec pathway which transports proteins in an unfolded manner, the <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway</b> serves to actively translocate folded proteins across a lipid membrane bilayer. In plants, the Tat translocase {{is located in the}} thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast, where it acts to export proteins into the thylakoid lumen. In bacteria, the Tat translocase is found in the cytoplasmic membrane and serves to export proteins to the cell envelope, or to the extracellular space.|$|E
50|$|Not all {{bacteria}} {{carry the}} tatABC genes in their genome; however, {{of those that}} do, {{there seems to be}} no discrimination between pathogens and nonpathogens. Despite that fact, some pathogenic bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and E. coli O157:H7 rely on a functioning <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway</b> for full virulence in infection models. In addition, a number of exported virulence factors have been shown to rely on the <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway.</b> One such category of virulence factors are the phospholipase C enzymes, which have been shown to be Tat-exported in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and thought to be Tat-exported in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.|$|E
50|$|The {{name of the}} <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway</b> {{relates to}} a highly conserved twin-arginine leader motif (S/TRRXFLK) which {{is found in the}} N {{terminal}} Signal peptide of the corresponding passenger proteins. The signal peptide is removed by a signal peptidase after release of the transported protein from the Tat complex. At least two TatC molecules co-exist within each Tat translocon.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Tat</b> <b>pathways</b> of Gram-positive {{bacteria}} {{differ in}} {{that they do not}} have a TatB component. In these bacteria the Tat system is made up from a single TatA and TatC component, with the TatA protein being bifunctional and fulfilling the roles of both E. coli TatA and TatB.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with other}} {{secretory}} {{systems such as}} the chaperone/usher pathway and the type IV secretion system, secretion via the type II secretion system is a two-step process. The first step involves the Sec and <b>Tat</b> secretory <b>pathways</b> which are responsible for transporting proteins across the inner membrane into the periplasm. For instance, the Sec pathway is used to transport structural components of the type II secretion system into the periplasm where they can then assemble, while both the Sec and <b>Tat</b> <b>pathways</b> are used to transport secretory proteins into the periplasm. Once these secretory proteins are in the periplasm the second step can then take place and they are secreted out of the cell through the type II secretion system.|$|R
40|$|Membrane protein {{assembly}} is {{a fundamental}} process in all cells. The membrane-bound Rieske iron-sulfur protein is {{an essential component of}} the cytochrome bc 1 and cytochrome b 6 f complexes, and it is exported across the energy-coupling membranes of bacteria and plants in a folded conformation by the twin arginine protein transport <b>pathway</b> (<b>Tat)</b> transport <b>pathway.</b> Although the Rieske protein in most organisms is a monotopic membrane protein, in actinobacteria, it is a polytopic protein with three transmembrane domains. In this work, we show that the Rieske protein of Streptomyces coelicolor requires both the Sec and the <b>Tat</b> <b>pathways</b> for its assembly. Genetic and biochemical approaches revealed that the initial two transmembrane domains were integrated into the membrane in a Sec-dependent manner, whereas integration of the third transmembrane domain, and thus the correct orientation of the iron-sulfur domain, required the activity of the Tat translocase. This work reveals an unprecedented co-operation between the mechanistically distinct Sec and Tat systems in the assembly of a single integral membrane protein. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the plant}} {{thylakoid}} membrane and in Gram-negative bacteria the Tat translocase {{is composed of}} three essential membrane proteins; TatA, TatB, and TatC. In the most widely studied <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway,</b> that of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, these three proteins are expressed from an operon with a fourth Tat protein, TatD, which is not required for Tat function. A fifth Tat protein TatE that is homologous to the TatA protein is present {{at a much lower}} level in the cell than TatA and is not believed to play any significant role in Tat function.|$|E
50|$|Halocins are {{classified}} as either peptide (≤ 10 kDa; 'microhalocins') or protein (> 10 kDa) antibiotics produced {{by members of the}} archaeal family Halobacteriaceae. To date, all of the known halocin genes are encoded on megaplasmids (> 100 kbp) and possess typical haloarcheal TATA and BRE promoter regions. Halocin transcripts are leaderless and the translated preproteins or preproproteins are most likely exported using the twin arginine translocation (<b>Tat)</b> <b>pathway,</b> as the Tat signal motif (two adjacent arginine residues) is present within the amino terminus. Halocin genes are almost universally expressed at the transition between exponential and stationary phases of growth; the only exception is halocin H1, which is induced during exponential phase. In contrast, the larger halocin proteins are heat-labile and typically obligately halophilic as they lose their activity (or activity is reduced) when desalted.|$|E
40|$|The twin {{arginine}} translocation (<b>Tat)</b> <b>pathway</b> occurs {{naturally in}} E. coli {{and has the}} distinct ability to translocate folded proteins across the inner membrane of the cell. It {{has the potential to}} export commercially useful proteins that cannot be exported by the ubiquitous Sec pathway. To better understand the bioprocess potential of the <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway,</b> this article addresses the fermentation and downstream processing performances of E. coli strains with a wild-type Tat system exporting the over-expressed substrate protein FhuD. These were compared to strains cell-engineered to over-express the <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway,</b> since the native export capacity of the <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway</b> is low. This low capacity makes the pathway susceptible to saturation by over-expressed substrate proteins, and can result in compromised cell integrity. However, there is concern in the literature that over-expression of membrane proteins, like those of the <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway,</b> can impact negatively upon membrane integrity itself. Under controlled fermentation conditions E. coli cells with a wild-type <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway</b> showed poor protein accumulation, reaching a periplasmic maximum of only 0. 5 [*]mg[*]L− 1 of growth medium. Cells over-expressing the <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway</b> showed a 25 % improvement in growth rate, avoided pathway saturation, and showed 40 -fold higher periplasmic accumulation of FhuD. Moreover, this was achieved whilst conserving the integrity of cells for downstream processing: experimentation comparing the robustness of cells to increasing levels of shear showed no detrimental effect from pathway over-expression. Further experimentation on spheroplasts generated by the lysozyme/osmotic shock method—a scaleable way to release periplasmic protein—showed similar robustness between strains. A scale-down mimic of continuous disk-stack centrifugation predicted clarifications in excess of 90 % for both intact cells and spheroplasts. Cells over-expressing the <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway</b> performed comparably to cells with the wild-type system. Overall, engineering E. coli cells to over-express the <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway</b> allowed for greater periplasmic yields of FhuD at the fermentation scale without compromising downstream processing performance...|$|E

40|$|Surface proteins, {{essential}} structural {{components of}} bacterial cell wall, are synthesized as precursors equipped with specific functional domains.

40|$|AbstractNascent polypeptides {{emerging}} from the ribosome are assisted by a pool of molecular chaperones and targeting factors, which enable them to efficiently partition as cytosolic, integral membrane or exported proteins. Extensive genetic and biochemical analyses have significantly expanded our knowledge of chaperone tasking throughout this process. In bacteria, {{it is known that}} the folding of newly-synthesized cytosolic proteins is mainly orchestrated by three highly conserved molecular chaperones, namely Trigger Factor (TF), DnaK (HSP 70) and GroEL (HSP 60). Yet, {{it has been reported that}} these major chaperones are strongly involved in protein translocation pathways as well. This review describes such essential molecular chaperone functions, with emphasis on both the biogenesis of inner membrane proteins and the post-translational targeting of presecretory proteins to the Sec and the twin-arginine translocation (<b>Tat)</b> <b>pathways.</b> Critical interplay between TF, DnaK, GroEL and other molecular chaperones and targeting factors, including SecB, SecA, the signal recognition particle (SRP) and the redox enzyme maturation proteins (REMPs) is also discussed.

40|$|The twin-arginine {{translocation}} (<b>Tat)</b> <b>pathway</b> is {{a relatively}} recently discovered protein translocation mechanism {{that is capable of}} facilitating the movement of prefolded proteins across cellular membranes. The overall physiological role of this pathway, as well as the mechanism of protein secretion via the <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway,</b> has been best described in Escherichia coli. However, the role and mechanism of the <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway</b> have not been described for other organisms in any great detail. ^ This study involves the computational characterization of the twin-arginine translocation pathway in different bacteria and archaea in an effort to determine how various organisms are using the <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway.</b> Such analyses predicted that while many prokaryotes lacked the <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway</b> or used this secretory mechanism to translocate only a few substrates, other organisms targeted a significant fraction of the secretome to the <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway</b> for translocation. In addition, the wide variety of functional proteins predicted as Tat substrates indicated that in many prokaryotes the <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway</b> is a general translocation machinery (unlike what was assumed based on E. coli analyses). ^ Two organisms with an extraordinary high number of Tat substrates, Haloferax volcanii and Streptomyces coelicolor, were further analyzed using genetic and biochemical tools. In H. volcanii, seven distinct proteins (including potential C-terminal anchored proteins and lipoproteins) were confirmed as Tat substrates. The presence of three of tat machinery genes was required for viability in H. volcanii when grown under aerobic conditions in complex media (representing the first report of requirement for this pathway under such growth conditions). The translational products of these genes also exhibited unique biochemical localization and primary structure that may represent an adaptation to the unique utilization of the <b>Tat</b> <b>pathway</b> in this organism.

40|$|Bacterial twin {{arginine}} translocation (<b>Tat)</b> <b>pathways</b> {{have evolved}} to facilitate transport of folded proteins across membranes. Gram-negative bacteria contain a TatABC translocase composed of three subunits named TatA, TatB, and TatC. In contrast, the Tat translocases of most Gram-positive bacteria consist of only TatA and TatC subunits. In these minimal TatAC translocases, a bifunctional TatA subunit fulfils the roles of both TatA and TatB. Here we have probed the importance of conserved residues in the bifunctional TatAy subunit of Bacillus subtilis by site-specific mutagenesis. A set of engineered TatAy proteins with mutations in the cytoplasmic hinge and amphipathic helix regions {{were found to be}} inactive in protein translocation under standard growth conditions for B. subtilis or when heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. Nevertheless, these mutated TatAy proteins did assemble into TatAy and TatAyCy complexes, and they facilitated membrane association of twin arginine precursor proteins in E. coli. Interestingly, most of the mutated TatAyCy translocases were salt-sensitive in B. subtilis. Similarly, the TatAC translocases of Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus were salt-sensitive when expressed in B. subtilis. Taken together, our present observations imply that salt-sensitive electrostatic interactions have critical roles in the preprotein translocation activity of certain TatAC type translocases from Gram-positive bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Twin-arginine protein {{translocation}} (<b>Tat)</b> <b>pathways</b> {{are required}} for transport of folded proteins across bacterial, archaeal and chloroplast membranes. Recent studies indicate that Tat {{has evolved into a}} mainstream pathway for protein secretion in certain halophilic archaea, which thrive in highly saline environments. Here, we investigated the effects of environmental salinity on Tat-dependent protein secretion by the Gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, which encounters widely differing salt concentrations in its natural habitats. The results show that environmental salinity determines the specificity and need for Tat-dependent secretion of the Dyp-type peroxidase YwbN in B. subtilis. Under high salinity growth conditions, at least three Tat translocase subunits, namely TatAd, TatAy and TatCy, are involved in the secretion of YwbN. Yet, a significant level of Tat-independent YwbN secretion is also observed under these conditions. When B. subtilis is grown in medium with 1 % NaCl or without NaCl, the secretion of YwbN depends strictly on the previously described "minimal Tat translocase" consisting of the TatAy and TatCy subunits. Notably, in medium without NaCl, both tatAyCy and ywbN mutants display significantly reduced exponential growth rates and severe cell lysis. This is due to a critical role of secreted YwbN in the acquisition of iron under these conditions. Taken together, our findings show that environmental conditions, such as salinity, can determine the specificity and need for the secretion of a bacterial Tat substrate...|$|R

While {{the formation of the}} early translocation intermediate does not depend on a functional TAT translocation machinery, the appearance of the late intermediate is strictly coupled to the Δph-dependent transport of the 16 / 23 chimera. Accordingly, this translocation intermediate is found associated with two distinct complexes in the thylakoid membrane having apparent molecular masses of approximately 560 and 620 kDa, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Computational {{prediction}} of signal peptides {{is of great}} importance in computational biology. In addition to the general secretory pathway (Sec), Bacteria, Archaea and chloroplasts possess another major pathway that utilizes the Twin-Arginine translocase (Tat), which recognizes longer and less hydrophobic signal peptides carrying a distinctive pattern of two consecutive Arginines (RR) in the n-region. A major functional differentiation between the Sec and <b>Tat</b> export <b>pathways</b> {{lies in the fact}} that the former translocates secreted proteins unfolded through a protein-conducting channel, whereas the latter translocates completely folded proteins using an unknown mechanism. The purpose of this work is to develop a novel method for predicting and discriminating Sec from Tat signal peptides at better accuracy. Results: We report the development of a novel method, PRED-TAT, which is capable of discriminating Sec from Tat signal peptides and predicting their cleavage sites. The method is based on Hidden Markov Models and possesses a modular architecture suitable for both Sec and Tat signal peptides. On an independent test set of experimentally verified Tat signal peptides, PRED-TAT clearly outperforms the previously proposed methods TatP and TATFIND, whereas, when evaluated as a Sec signal peptide predictor compares favorably to top-scoring predictors such as SignalP and Phobius. The method is freely available for academic users at [URL]...|$|R
