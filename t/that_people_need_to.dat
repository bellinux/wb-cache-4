Buffett advises people to first create {{a list of}} the top 25 accomplishments {{that they would like to}} complete over the next few years of their life, and to then pick the five most-important list items. Buffett stated <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> “avoid at all cost” the initial, longer list, as it would hinder the achievement of the top-five.|$|E
25|$|Even when {{statistical}} {{techniques are}} correctly applied, {{the results can}} be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise. The statistical significance of a trend in the data—which measures {{the extent to which a}} trend could be caused by random variation in the sample—may or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance. The set of basic statistical skills (and skepticism) <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as statistical literacy.|$|E
25|$|But a {{continuing}} emphasis to the well-rounded graduate {{can be seen}} in the University's approach to education degrees. As a solely graduate-level program, this is based on the principle <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> learn primary subject matter well before they can learn how to teach it to others. Thus future teachers at Lehigh often take a five-year program earning both a bachelor's degree in a specialized field and a master's degree in Education. This latter degree, along with the Business College's M.B.A., are among the most popular graduate programs in the University.|$|E

500|$|Whitehead was unimpressed by this objection. [...] In {{the notes}} {{of one of}} his {{students}} for a 1927 class, Whitehead was quoted as saying: [...] "Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics. [...] What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized." [...] In Whitehead's view, scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time, but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned. [...] While Whitehead acknowledged that [...] "philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles," [...] he argued <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> continually re-imagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress, even if that progress remains permanently asymptotic. [...] For this reason Whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both good science and good philosophy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{generally}} {{intellectual and}} middle-class types who {{were attracted to}} Gurdjieff's teaching often found the Prieuré's spartan accommodation and emphasis on hard labour in the grounds disconcerting. Gurdjieff was putting into practice his teaching <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> develop physically, emotionally and intellectually, hence the mixture of lectures, music, dance, and manual work. Older pupils noticed how the Prieuré teaching differed from the complex metaphysical [...] "system" [...] that had been taught in Russia.

My previous big record company (Warner Bros.) has vaults of my recordings that haven't seen the light of day <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> hear. This includes Robert Palmer's original recording of 'Addicted to Love' – which they took my vocals off of! We are working on getting it (and other tracks) all back now."

2500|$|Gee's {{current work}} in the field of new literacies has seen him shift in his {{research}} focus somewhat from studying language-in-use to examining the D/iscourses of a range of new social practices—with a particular emphasis on video games and learning. Gee applies many key concepts from his previous research to studying video games. For example, Gee continues to argue that if we take reading to mean gaining understanding (instead of simply decoding letter sounds and words), one {{needs to be able to}} recognize or produce meanings inherent to any one semiotic domain in order to be literate in that domain. As such, and as Gee sets out in his text What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy, one can be literate in the semiotic domain of video games if he or she “can recognize (the equivalent of “reading”) and/or produce (the equivalent of “writing”) meanings” in the video game domain. Therefore, because new literacies are multiple and attached to social and cultural practices, Gee explains <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> (1) be literate in many different [...] semiotic domains, and (2) be able to become literate in other *new* semiotic domains throughout their lives. This theoretical orientation aligns with {{work in the}} broad field of [...] "new literacies" [...] research—by colleagues such as Colin Lankshear, Michele Knobel, Henry Jenkins, Kevin Leander, Rebecca Black, Kurt Squire, and Constance Steinkuehler, among others.|$|E
