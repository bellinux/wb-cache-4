5|$|A {{branch of}} the IND Culver Line running via Tenth Avenue and Fort Hamilton Parkway to 86th Street, with a {{connection}} to the BMT West End Line. West End service would run via the Culver Line and would alleviate congestion at DeKalb Avenue Junction. In order <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the BMT Fourth Avenue Line, the Culver Shuttle would be extended to 36th Street.|$|E
5|$|Highway {{engineers}} evaluated {{factors such}} as grading, curve radius and the narrow median used along the Middle Road (which was inaugurated on August 23, 1940, as the Queen Elizabeth Way), and began to plan {{the course of a}} new dual highway mostly parallel to Highway2, with precedence given to areas most hampered by congestion. Unlike the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW), this highway would not be built along an existing road, but rather on a new right-of-way, avoiding the need <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> properties.|$|E
5|$|The M-203 {{designation}} {{is maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> McLain State Park. The trunkline is not listed on the National Highway System, a system of strategically important highways. No section of it {{is located on the}} Lake Superior Circle Tour, although it is the closest state trunkline to Lake Superior in the area. The highway runs through forest lands and city streets most of the way, with the section along the Portage Lake Canal being residential most of the way.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>providing</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> {{large public}} data sets, the Exoplanet Archive has developed several tools {{to work with}} exoplanet and stellar host data.|$|R

5|$|The Zion–Mount Carmel Highway can be {{travelled}} year-round. Access for oversized vehicles {{requires a}} special permit, and {{is limited to}} daytime hours, as traffic through the tunnel must be one way to accommodate large vehicles. The -long Kolob Canyons Road was built <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the Kolob Canyons section of the park. This road often closes in the winter.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} project, Tonkin Highway was {{expanded}} from two to three lanes in both directions, between Great Eastern Highway and Roe Highway, with the existing intersections in this section becoming grade separated. A new diamond interchange was constructed with Dunreath Drive <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the domestic terminal precinct, replacing Brearley Avenue as the main access to the precinct. International terminal access was provided via a new freeway-to-freeway cloverstack interchange at Leach Highway, and a single-point urban interchange at the intersection with Horrie Miller Drive and Kewdale Road. The existing diamond interchange with Roe Highway was upgraded to a partial freeway-to-freeway interchange, but with plans to further upgrade it to a completely free-flowing interchange in the future.|$|E
5|$|As {{the highway}} leaves Cottonwood, it again becomes a divided highway north of Rocking Chair Road, heading into desert. Before {{reaching}} Sedona, SR 89A {{provides access to}} Red Rock State Park. The route remains a divided highway until it reaches Sedona, an arts and resort community known for its red sandstone formations. As it enters the city of Sedona, the route {{is known as the}} Si Birch Memorial Highway. The route continues east through Sedona, providing access to the Sedona Airport. SR 89A continues towards the east through Sedona to an intersection with SR 179, which heads south from this intersection through the southern part of Sedona <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> I-17.|$|E

5|$|Considerable {{work was}} also {{involved}} in building the roadway up the three-percent grade at {{the east end of}} Allegheny Mountain, the steepest grade the turnpike traversed. The base of Evitts Mountain was blasted to carry the turnpike across Bedford Narrows along with US30, the Raystown Branch of the Juniata River and a Pennsylvania Railroad branch line. In New Baltimore, the turnpike commission had to purchase land from St. John's Church (which contained a cemetery); as part of the agreement, stairways were built {{on either side of the}} turnpike <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the church.|$|E
5|$|Improvements in the Ellendale and Georgetown {{areas have}} been {{environmentally}} cleared, which means design and engineering can proceed as funding becomes available. The Federal Highway Administration approved the Ellendale Area Environmental Assessment with a Finding of No Significant Impact in 2010. DelDOT plans to upgrade US 113 on its present alignment through the study area, which runs from south of Redden Road to north of DE 16. Along much of the route, service roads would be constructed parallel to the present highway <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> properties along US 113 and {{to connect with the}} local road system and reduce the number of contact points with US 113. Interchanges are planned at Redden Road and DE 16.|$|E
5|$|Later in the decade, Portland {{upgraded}} City Hall {{by adding}} fire sprinklers and smoke detectors. In 1973, the sandstone exterior was cleaned and sealed to prevent moisture from eroding the fragile stone. It was {{later learned that}} this process was harmful as the silicon coating sealed the moisture inside the rock. In 1974, City Hall {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places. The following year the rooftop penthouse was converted into an employee break room that included an outdoor deck. In 1978, the city constructed a wheelchair ramp <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the handicapped.|$|E

5|$|Once in orbit, Big G {{would have}} docked with space {{stations}} using an Apollo docking probe {{mounted on the}} rear of the cargo module, which was in turn mounted on {{the rear of the}} re-entry module. The re-entry module itself would have been enlarged to accommodate the larger crew, and the modifications made to the spacecraft for the MOL program would have been incorporated, including the hatch in the heat shield, which would have been used <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the cargo module. In the event of a launch failure, the launch escape system developed for the Apollo spacecraft would have been used to propel the re-entry module clear of the rocket.|$|E
5|$|The second idea {{means that}} {{processes}} can offer their services to other processes by providing virtual files {{that appear in}} the other processes' namespace. The client process's input/output on such a file becomes inter-process communication between the two processes. This way, Plan 9 generalizes the Unix notion of the filesystem as the central point of access to computing resources. It carries over Unix's idea of device files <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> peripheral devices (mice, removable media, etc.) and the possibility to mount filesystems residing on physically distinct filesystems into a hierarchical namespace, but adds the possibility to mount a connection to a server program that speaks a standardized protocol and treat its services {{as part of the}} namespace.|$|E
5|$|Charles DeWitt Watts (September 21, 1917 – July 12, 2004) was an African American {{surgeon and}} activist for the poor. Watts {{was the first}} surgeon of African American ancestry in North Carolina. Earning his medical degree in 1943 from Howard University College, {{he was the first}} African American board {{certified}} surgeon to serve in North Carolina. After surgical training at Freedman's Hospital in Washington, D.C. in 1949, he moved to Durham, North Carolina in 1950 and established a clinic <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> medical services for the poor. Breaking the social customs of racial obstacles, he advocated for certification of African American medical students. He also became a member of many professional colleges including the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine and the American College of Surgeons. He served as chief of surgery at Durham's Lincoln Hospital and was later one of the key figures in converting it to the Lincoln Community Health Center, a low-priced clinic for the poor.|$|E

5|$|Due in part {{to strong}} public support, the MTA Board {{committed}} in April 2000 to building a full-length subway line along the East Side, from East Harlem to Lower Manhattan. In May 2000, the MTA Capital Program Review Board approved the MTA's 2000–2004 Capital Program, which allocated $1.05 billion {{for the construction of}} the Second Avenue Subway. In 2001, a contract for subway design was awarded to DMJM Harris/Arup Joint Venture. A new draft statement proposed the full-length line from 125th to 14th Streets. South of 14th Street, the line could either travel under Chrystie Street, St. James Place and Water Street to a terminal in Lower Manhattan, or link to the existing Nassau Street Loop tracks J1 and J2 at Kenmare Street <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Lower Manhattan. The Water Street option was the one eventually chosen.|$|E
5|$|From Howard northward, {{the freeway}} runs through {{suburban}} Brown County to Suamico, parallel {{to a line}} of the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad (ELS), through a mixture of farm fields and residential subdivisions. There are frontage roads {{on both sides of}} the freeway <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the properties immediately adjacent to US41/US141. There are a number of interchanges with county-maintained roads between Suamico and Abrams in Oconto County. At Abrams, US141 splits from US41 and heads northward while the latter freeway turns northeasterly. The landscape north of the split transitions to forest, and the freeway crosses the Oconto River in Stiles south of the interchange with WIS22. The freeway bypasses Lena to the east and continues north through mixed farm fields and forest to the county line. North of the line, US141 continues to the Marinette County communities of Coleman and Pound as an expressway. Through Coleman and Pound there is also a Business US141. Past the latter town, US141 transitions from expressway to a two-lane undivided highway.|$|E
5|$|Here, DE 9 turns {{northeast}} onto East 6th Street, {{crossing a}} marshy creek and widening into a four-lane divided highway. The route curves north and becomes Wilmington Road, passing through commercial areas. The road crosses the Norfolk Southern New Castle Secondary again {{and runs through}} suburban residential neighborhoods and businesses, leaving New Castle. DE 9 becomes New Castle Avenue and passes {{to the west of}} Veterans Memorial Park before it comes to an interchange with I-295/US 40 a short distance {{to the west of the}} Delaware Memorial Bridge. After the Rogers Road intersection, DE 9 becomes a four-lane undivided road that continues through industrial and residential areas, crossing under I-495. The road briefly becoming a divided highway again and intersects the southern terminus of DE 9A, which heads east <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> I-495 and the Port of Wilmington.|$|E
