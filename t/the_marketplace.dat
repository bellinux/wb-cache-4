40|$|In this paper, we {{intended}} to reveal identities, through the behavior diversity of individuals inserted in two hippie marketplaces, {{in two different}} countries. The studied locus were the “Saturday Market”, {{in the state of}} Oregon, United States, and the “Feira Hippie” of Belo Horizonte, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Semi-structured interviews and the ethnographic method were considered satisfactory to apprehend the every-day behaviors in <b>the</b> <b>marketplaces.</b> So, by <b>the</b> end of the research process, we had a rich data to analyze, which allowed us to reveal identities constructed by the expositors’ practices. We concluded that identities in <b>the</b> <b>marketplaces</b> are detected through historical, behavioral and spatial aspects. <b>The</b> <b>marketplaces</b> were institutions with distinct meanings, different contexts and attractive to different public. However, the professional identity of artisan presented some similar nuances in both places. This identity was the identitary link between <b>the</b> two <b>marketplaces...</b>|$|R

5|$|As well as {{the mayoral}} inaugurations, <b>the</b> <b>marketplace</b> was also the setting for other public events, {{particularly}} mourning processions on the deaths of monarchs, coronation celebrations, royal birthdays and celebrations of military victories. Firework displays and bonfires would be held on these occasions, accompanied by the local militia firing volleys and the ringing of the bells of the surrounding churches, while local residents and shopkeepers would illuminate their windows with lit candles. Often, particularly in the 18thcentury, temporary triumphal arches would be erected beside the Guildhall. Free beer would traditionally be distributed at these events, which would on occasion degenerate into drunken disorder.|$|E

5|$|The Western Han capital at Chang'an {{was divided}} into one hundred and sixty walled {{residential}} wards. Affairs of each ward were overseen by a low-ranking official. Influential families within the wards usually maintained social order. Historians are still unsure as to how many government-controlled marketplaces existed in Chang'an. Although there are claims of nine markets, {{it is possible that}} seven of them were actually divisible parts of two main markets: the East Market and West Market. Both the East Market and West Market had a two-story government office with a flag and drum placed on the roof. A market chief and deputy were headquartered in each of these buildings, yet not much is known about their involvement in <b>the</b> <b>marketplace.</b> In the Eastern Han capital of Luoyang, the market chief's office employed thirty-six sub-officers who ventured into <b>the</b> <b>marketplace</b> daily to maintain law and order. They also collected taxes on commercial goods, assigned standard prices for specific commodities on the basis of monthly reviews, and authorized contracts between merchants and their customers or clients. Besides merchants engaging in marketplace violations, other crimes were committed by adolescent street gangs who often wore clothes distinguishing their gang. The maintenance of law and order outside the market and in slum areas was conducted by constables; Han officials sometimes argued for increasing their salaries which they assumed would encourage them to reject bribes from criminals.|$|E
