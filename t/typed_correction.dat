40|$|We {{consider}} both massive Euler-Heisenberg-like and Euler-Heisenberg-like Electrodynamics in the {{approximation of}} the strong-field limit.

5000|$|In {{the legal}} {{literature}} some furthermore require an especially despicable breach of trust—which however would exclude hideous attack outside {{a relationship of}} trust. This position is therefore considered as too restrictive. Furthermore the criteria is very vague, since {{it is unclear what}} relationship would be considered relationships of trust (for example, should a subverted relationship, in which one of the partner regularly beats his spouse still be considered a relationship of trust). Others argue that the courts are forgetting the subjective element of the word treacherous. They point out that the German word [...] "Heimtückisch" [...] consist of two elements: heimlich (by stealth) and tückisch (treacherous). Heimtücke would therefore mean heimliche Tücke (by stealth; treacherousness). They argue that the killing of a sleeping house tyrant, that is tyrannizing his family, is a killing by stealth but that it could not be considered as treacherous. However, they can not give a definition when a killing by stealth has to be considered as treacherous. They just point to certain cases they want to exclude from murder due to the mitigating circumstances. Therefore this position is also considered as too vague by the courts. The judiciary maintains that also in those cases the perpetrator is usually aware and uses the unsuspiciousness and defenselessness of the person from attack in an hostile attitude. Therefore they conclude that a killing by stealth is treacherous, when the perpetrator is aware of the unsuspiciousness and defenselessness of the person from attack in an hostile attitude. However, due to the specially circumstances the sentences is reduced according to § 49 I StGB to 3 to 15 years. Both positions have problems. The position of the literature gives no clear criteria do define the difference between treacherous killings (Heimtückemord) and Totschlag. That leaves it to the judge to decide whether a killing committed by stealth still ought not to be considered as a treacherous murder due to special mitigating circumstances. Therefore this position leads in fact to a negative <b>type</b> <b>correction.</b> Some in the literature advocate such a negative <b>type</b> <b>correction.</b> Negative <b>type</b> <b>correction</b> means, that the murder characteristics are necessary to sentence someone for Murder, but that they are not final. In extraordinary circumstances the court may sentence just for Totschlag, if the case is atypical to the usual cases due to special mitigating circumstances. In the older literature some even suggest a positive <b>type</b> <b>correction.</b> That means that the murder characteristics are necessary to sentence someone for Murder, but that additionally to fulfilling {{at least one of the}} characteristics the court has to assess the special damnability of the killing. However, the wording of § 211 StGB doesn't mentions an additional criteria of a special damnability (positive <b>type</b> <b>correction).</b> The wording of § 211 StGB also doesn't indicate that under special mitigating circumstances the court may consider a crime as Totschlag although it fulfills one of the characteristics of § 211 StGB (negative <b>type</b> <b>correction).</b> Therefore positive and negative <b>type</b> <b>correction</b> are seen by the courts as not in accordance with the current law and are therefore rejected. The definition of the judiciary is clear. But also cases with special mitigating circumstances fall under this definition, for which the lifetime prison sentence is too hard. The judiciary milders the sentence according to § 49 I StGB. However, § 49 I StGB can only be used for mitigating circumstances defined by law, not generally for [...] "lesser cases". Therefore both positions can be criticized. However, some kind of correction is required to avoid a disproportionate punishment in cases with obviously extraordinary mitigating circumstances.Examples for treacherous killing: killing with poison, killing of a sleeping person, killing from the back, surprise attack, but also trapping cases (to trap someone to go to another place (flat of the perpetrator, deserted area) in order to attack him there openly).|$|R

40|$|We use an {{importance}} sampling (IS) <b>type</b> <b>correction</b> of approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) output to provide consistent estimators. The IS approach, based on unbiased estimators, provides a natural alternative to delayed acceptance (DA) MCMC, but contrary to DA-MCMC, benefits from straightforward parallelisation. We {{focus on the}} case where the MCMC simulation is conducted on an approximate marginal distribution, and the IS <b>type</b> <b>correction</b> leads to consistent inference on the corresponding joint distribution. Such a case allows for importance sampling analogues of pseudo-marginal type MCMC methods, such as the grouped independence Metropolis-Hastings and the particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings. We detail strong consistency of the suggested estimators under mild assumptions, and provide central limit theorems with expressions for asymptotic variances. The methods are illustrated in practice with state space models, where our experimental results are promising and show that IS type approach can be favourable against a computationally comparable DA scheme.

40|$|This report {{documents}} the important aspects in deriving the intervention values for lead (Pb) for soil/sediment and groundwater {{as part of}} a current ongoing running evaluation of existing intervention values. Reported for lead are the physical-chemical properties, the ecotoxicological serious soil-contamination concentration (ECOTOX SCC), the human toxicological Maximal Tolerable Risk (human MTR), human toxicological serious soil contamination concentration (HUM-TOX SCC) and proposals for the intervention value for soil and groundwater. It is recommended to use an equation derived for field soils (with pH, organic matter and clay content) for the soil <b>type</b> <b>correction</b> of the intervention values derived. If it is decided to use only the organic-matter and clay content, we advise proceeding with the current correction of Van den Berg/Roels. Based on the current toxicological information, ECOTOX SCC is recalculated with the current soil <b>type</b> <b>correction</b> (490 mg/kg d. m.) and the proposed soil <b>type</b> <b>correction</b> with pH (450 mg/kg d. m.). If it is decided to use the 'added risk-approach', the ECOTOX SCC for lead will be 575 and 535 mg/kg d. m., respectively. The ECOTOX SCC calculated for sediments is much higher (64. 000 mg/kg d. m.). The human-toxicological maximal tolerable risk (human MTR) is maintained at 3. 6 microg/kg b. w. /day, which is also supported by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The human exposure to lead is mainly determined by the ingestion of soil particles, the intake of contaminated crops and the bioavailability of lead from soil in the human body. Prior to completing the research on bioavailability in the human body, a relative bioavailability factor for lead in soil of 0. 6 was deduced. An average of 100 mg of soil per day is proposed for soil ingestion by children (1 to 6), instead of the current 150 mg per day. The average crop consumption can be slightly reduced. If it is decided to use a general background, the background exposure for lead is estimated to be 25 % of the human MTR. The recalculated HUMTOX EBVC is found between 450 and 670 mg/kg, depending on the choices made {{and the extent to which}} new data are used. Integration of the HUMTOX SCC value with that of ECOTOX SCC leads to a proposal for the intervention value soil/sediment of 450 - 575 mg/kg d. m. and 32 - 41 microg/l for groundwate...|$|R
