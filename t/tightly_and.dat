5|$|The F-22 {{is highly}} maneuverable at both {{supersonic}} and subsonic speeds. Computerized {{flight control system}} and full-authority digital engine control (FADEC) make the aircraft highly departure resistant and controllable. The Raptor's relaxed stability and powerful thrust-vectoring engines enable the aircraft to turn <b>tightly</b> <b>and</b> perform very high alpha (angle of attack) maneuvers such as the Herbst maneuver (J-turn) and Pugachev's Cobra. The aircraft is also capable of maintaining over 60° alpha while having some roll control.|$|E
5|$|As enzymes {{have evolved}} to bind their {{substrates}} <b>tightly,</b> <b>and</b> most reversible inhibitors bind in the active site of enzymes, it is unsurprising {{that some of these}} inhibitors are strikingly similar in structure to the substrates of their targets. An example of these substrate mimics are the protease inhibitors, a very successful class of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV. The structure of ritonavir, a protease inhibitor based on a peptide and containing three peptide bonds, is shown on the right. As this drug resembles the protein that is the substrate of the HIV protease, it competes with this substrate in the enzyme's active site.|$|E
5|$|Genomic DNA is <b>tightly</b> <b>and</b> orderly {{packed in}} the process called DNA condensation, to fit the small {{available}} volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, DNA {{is located in the}} cell nucleus, with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its genotype. A gene is a unit of heredity and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an open reading frame that can be transcribed, and regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers, which control transcription of the open reading frame.|$|E

5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual <b>tightly,</b> <b>and</b> the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house {{because he could not}} see the washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} {{compartments}} that store lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life {{of lead in}} these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone. Lead in the bones, teeth, hair, and nails is bound <b>tightly</b> <b>and</b> not available to other tissues, and is generally thought not to be harmful. In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health effects on children. The estimated half-life of lead in bone is 20 to 30years, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone. The half-life of lead in the blood in men is about 40days, {{but it may be}} longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing remodeling, which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream. Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone. Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs.|$|E
5|$|Zoroastrians were {{subjected}} to public discrimination through dress regulations – not allowed to wear new or white clothes, and compelled by enactments to wear the dull yellow raiment already alluded to as a distinguishing badge. They {{were not allowed to}} wear overcoats but were compelled to wear long robes called qaba and cotton geeveh on their feet even in winter. Wearing eyeglasses, long cloak, trousers, hat, boots, socks, winding their turbans <b>tightly</b> <b>and</b> neatly, carrying watch or a ring, were all forbidden to Zoroastrians. During the rainy days they were not allowed carry umbrellas or to appear in public, because the water that had run down through their bodies and cloths could pollute the Muslims. Zoroastrian men in Yazd would carry a large shawl that they would place under their feet when visiting a Muslim's home so as to prevent the carpet from being polluted. Forbidden from riding horses and only allowed to ride mules or donkeys, upon facing a Muslim they had to dismount. Not until 1923, was the general proscription against Zoroastrians' riding horses and donkeys lifted by Reza Shah.|$|E

25|$|Apart from pure metal chains, {{cable ties}} are also {{often used as}} {{a quick way to}} tie someone up securely.

25|$|Women {{can stimulate}} {{themselves}} sexually by crossing their legs <b>tightly</b> <b>and</b> clenching {{the muscles in}} their legs, creating pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Thoughts, fantasies, and memories of previous instances of arousal and orgasm can produce sexual excitation. Some women can orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, although this may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{fashion and}} medical uses, corsets {{are also used}} in sexual fetishism, most notably in BDSM activities. In BDSM, a {{submissive}} {{may be required to}} wear a corset, which would be laced very <b>tightly</b> <b>and</b> restrict the wearer to some degree. A dominant may also wear a corset, often black, but for entirely different reasons, such as aesthetics. A specially designed corset, in which the breasts and vulva are exposed, can be worn during vanilla sex or BDSM activities.|$|E

25|$|Among the Platonic solids, {{either the}} dodecahedron or the {{icosahedron}} {{may be seen}} as the best approximation to the sphere.

The dodecahedron, on the other hand, has the smallest angular defect, the largest vertex solid angle, and it fills out its circumscribed sphere the most.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{was also}} given decrypted {{messages}} by Dutch (NEI) intelligence, who {{like the others}} in the British–Dutch–U.S. agreement to share the cryptographic load, shared information with allies. However, the U.S. refused to do likewise. This was, at least in part, due to fears of compromise; sharing even between the US Navy and Army was restricted. The eventual flow of intercepted and decrypted information was <b>tightly</b> <b>and</b> capriciously controlled. At times, even President Roosevelt did not receive all information from code-breaking activities. There were fears of compromise as a result of poor security after a memo dealing with Magic was found in the desk of Brigadier General Edwin M. (Pa) Watson, the President's military aide.|$|E

A scuffle then ensued between soldiers and a few activists. The soldiers used physical force, electric shocks, and stun grenades to gain control, {{but there were no}} major injuries. Paul Larudee, a 64-year-old former linguistics professor from El Cerrito, California, on board the Sfendoni, was beaten and tased according to his family, who said that Israeli consular officials informed them that Larudee, a pacifist, was beaten after refusing to follow the orders of troops.|$|E

25|$|On {{the lower}} {{abdominal}} skin, a slight skin slit {{was made to}} allow the future urethra to be passed through upon inversion of the neovaginal lining. A Foley catheter was inserted and the urethra was sutured onto the catheter, about 5cm distally from its passage through the skin. No skin suture {{was used in the}} urethral meatus, and some kind of scar contraction was always foreseen. Two sutures were bilaterally passed through the perianal skin and the levator ani muscles and served to <b>tightly</b> <b>and</b> firmly support an obstetric stent, placed in the neovagina to provide support for the inverted skin flap. A drain was left in the posterior commissure and, finally, excess scrotal skin was resected to obtain a good appearance of the major labia.|$|E
25|$|Director Victor Lobl also planned out the mannerisms {{shown by}} Brooks as Sisko where he talks {{directly}} to the camera. He praised the actor, saying that he delivered exactly what Lobl's written direction had described. All of those sequences were shot almost in direct continuity {{to ensure that the}} audience believed that it was a single log recording. Lobl had those filmed very <b>tightly,</b> <b>and</b> so there were not many options available in editing as only two angles were filmed for those sequences. The script had called for Sisko to get more and more drunk during those sequences as he descends into the flashbacks; Lobl had expected the studio to pull that idea before filming but they did not. Lobl also had Sisko begin to remove various parts of his uniform at the same time, which he felt demonstrated that the character was baring his soul about the story.|$|E
25|$|Botham's final {{tour was}} to Australia and New Zealand in 1991–92. He {{played in the}} World Cup in Australia and in the third Test in New Zealand. Botham did not win any man of the match awards in the World Cup until 1992 when he won two. Against India at the WACA Ground, he bowled <b>tightly</b> <b>and</b> {{restricted}} India, needing 237, to only 27 runs from his ten overs, an economy rate of 2.70 which was significantly lower than anyone else's. He captured two wickets {{and one of them}} was Sachin Tendulkar. England won by nine runs. Against Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground later in the competition, Botham won the award for the sort of all-round performance which had made his reputation. Australia won the toss and decided to bat first. They scored 171 all out in 49 overs and Botham took four for 31 in his ten. He then opened the England innings with Graham Gooch and scored 53 from only 77 balls in a partnership with Gooch of 107. England went on to win by eight wickets with nine overs to spare.|$|E

25|$|Format in {{this tournament}} was {{same as the}} first one: four groups of three, then two groups of four in quarter-finals; top two into semi-finals. This {{competition}} was played in London, Lord's and Oval, and Nottingham. Out of the 10 full members, Zimbabwe withdrew its participation. Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland qualified for the tournament. It was full of surprise victories, as favourites fell {{at the hands of}} underdogs. The hosts, England, set the ball rolling in the first match of the tournament as they were embarrassed by Netherlands in a final-ball thriller. Australia were dominated by West Indies, largely thanks to a thunderous innings by Chris Gayle, as he hit 88 off 50 balls, including some of the largest sixes seen in England. Australia were then defeated by Sri Lanka, who bowled <b>tightly</b> <b>and</b> batted with dominance, including quick-fire half centuries from Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara. Ireland beat Bangladesh in the Group stage to qualify for the Super Eight. Previous champions, India, lost all its matches of the Super Eight Stage. South Africa hadn't lost a group stage match going into the semi-finals against Pakistan, but Shahid Afridi produced a match winning performance with both bat and ball. He blasted his way to 51 and bagged two wickets for 16 runs to secure victory. The final at Lord's was a repeat of a group stage match between Sri Lanka and Pakistan; the latter lost the previous encounter. Pakistan managed to remove Dilshan, the Player of the Series for his 317 runs, without scoring, which had a big impact on the Sri Lanka innings. Sangakkara put up a fight scoring an unbeaten 64, but a target of 138 wasn't going to be easy to defend. Afridi proved this to be correct, hitting an unbeaten 54, which helped Pakistan win the trophy with 8 balls to spare.|$|E
500|$|Another concern {{now facing}} Paralympic {{officials}} is {{the technique of}} [...] "boosting". [...] Athletes can artificially increase their blood pressure, often by self-harming, which {{has been shown to}} improve performance by up to 15%.
