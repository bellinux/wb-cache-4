5|$|Many corals in {{the order}} Scleractinia are hermatypic, meaning that they are {{involved}} in building reefs. Most such corals obtain some of their energy from zooxanthellae in the genus Symbiodinium. These are symbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates which require sunlight; reef-forming corals are therefore found mainly in shallow water. They secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons that become <b>the</b> <b>framework</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reef. However, not all reef-building corals in shallow water contain zooxanthellae, and some deep water species, living at depths to which light cannot penetrate, form reefs but do not harbour the symbionts.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Darwaza {{supported}} the Ottoman Empire {{based on his}} feelings of identification with Islam and {{of belonging to the}} larger Ottoman Muslim ummah ("nation"). In 1906, he served in the local Ottoman administration as a clerk in the Department of Telegraphic and Postal Services (DTPS) in Nablus. His first assignment in that department was for the District of Beisan and northern Palestine (the Galilee and northern Samaria). He was also an Arabist and was enthusiastic about the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, expecting that the new Ottoman government would institute reforms and grant the Arabs autonomy within <b>the</b> <b>framework</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empire.|$|E
