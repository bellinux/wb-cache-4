5|$|Black American Sign Language (BASL) or Black Sign Variation (BSV) is a dialect of American Sign Language (ASL) {{used most}} {{commonly}} by deaf African Americans in the United States. The divergence from ASL was influenced largely by <b>the</b> <b>segregation</b> {{of schools in}} the American South. Like other schools at the time, schools for the deaf were segregated based upon race, creating two language communities among deaf signers: White deaf signers at White schools and Black deaf signers at Black schools. Today, BASL is still used by signers in the South despite public schools having been legally desegregated since 1954.|$|E

40|$|The Marginal Border Series (MBS) of the Skaergaard Intrusion {{crystallised}} on the steeply dipping sidewalls of the magma chamber. Melt-rich segregations, {{previously described}} as the 'wavy pyroxene rock' are a key feature of the otherwise homogeneous outermost parts of the MBS. <b>The</b> lens-shaped <b>segregations</b> consistently strike parallel to the chamber wall and have a moderate dip towards it. The shape, size, grain size and mineralogy of <b>the</b> <b>segregations</b> evolve systematically away from the chamber wall. <b>The</b> <b>segregations</b> become bigger, more widely spaced, chemically more evolved and more irregular in shape with increasing distance from <b>the</b> margin. <b>The</b> <b>segregations</b> were previously interpreted as a nucleation effect parallel to the thermal gradient. However, they dip toward the margin, not parallel to it. We offer a new interpretation: that <b>the</b> <b>segregations</b> represent tearing of poorly consolidated crystal mush during localised sagging of the vertical solidification front. The tears form during a process analogous to 'hot tearing' of metal alloys, although the driving force for tearing is probably gravitational collapse of the vertical solidification front, or perhaps contemporaneous faulting during chamber filling. Small, regular tears formed in the thinner, more rapidly cooled outer parts of the MBS, while the larger, irregular tears formed in the coarser grained, inner parts. Movement of interstitial liquid fed the cracks after tearing, and the liquid crystallised as relatively evolved, coarse-grained <b>segregations.</b> <b>The</b> mineral chemistry and texture of <b>the</b> <b>segregations</b> suggest that <b>the</b> tearing occurs relatively early in the crystallisation history.

40|$|Concentrations of dark-colored, highly vesicular, quench-textured mesostasis occur {{commonly}} in volcanic rocks {{drilled in}} the Lau Basin during Leg 135. These segregations occur as veins, patches, and vesicle linings in rocks with 49 %- 54 % SiO 2. <b>The</b> <b>segregations</b> are depleted in Mg, Ca, Al, Sc, Ni, and Cr and enriched in Ti, Ba, Y, and Zr {{compared to the}} groundmass with which they occur. Many of <b>the</b> <b>segregations</b> are unusually enriched in copper. The elemental variations show that <b>the</b> <b>segregations</b> are residual liquids produced by 12 %- 55 % crystallization of plagioclase and clinopyroxene, with minor olivine, opaques, or orthopyroxene from the groundmass melt. The liquids forming <b>the</b> <b>segregations</b> are mobilized and emplaced in earlier formed vesicles during the rapid crystallization of the groundmass. The dominant process in this mobilization and emplacement is volatile exsolution from crystallizing melts constrained by a rigid crystalline framework. This exsolution produces significant overpressures within the late-stage melts; the overpressure drives the residual melts through {{the walls of the}} older vesicles, along planes of weakness, and into voids. This mechanism is consistent with the occurrence of bimodal vesicle populations in many of the host lavas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} the {{stability}} of centerline inhomogenity of continuously cast slabs and hot rolled products. <b>The</b> centerline <b>segregation</b> is a disadvantageous failure of slabs which can affect the quality properties of the final products. During hot rolling of slabs <b>the</b> centerline <b>segregation</b> pattern will become thin and stretch and {{it can also be}} detected in the middle part of heavy plates and coils. It is a common experience that <b>the</b> centerline <b>segregation</b> of heavy plates can not be easily decreased by post heat treatment. The pattern of <b>the</b> centerline <b>segregation</b> was modeled physically by preparing a sandwich structure of steel plates with different levels of carbon and alloying elements. Homogenization experiments were performed and the samples were examined metallographically. Diffusional calculations proved the governing role of carbon activity which is influenced by the distribution of alloying elements...|$|R
