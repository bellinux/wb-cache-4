5|$|The metal-rich {{white dwarf}} WD 1145+017 {{is the first}} white dwarf {{observed}} with a disintegrating minor planet which transits the star. <b>The</b> <b>disintegration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planetesimal generates a debris cloud which passes {{in front of the}} star every 4.5 hours, causing a 5-minute-long fade in the star's optical brightness. The depth of the transit is highly variable.|$|E

5|$|Diefenbaker's disinclination to make {{concessions}} to Quebec, along with <b>the</b> <b>disintegration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union Nationale, {{the failure of the}} Tories to build an effective structure in Quebec, and Diefenbaker appointing few Quebecers to his Cabinet, none to senior positions, all led to an erosion of Progressive Conservative support in Quebec. Diefenbaker did recommend the appointment of the first French-Canadian governor general, Georges Vanier.|$|E
5|$|Having {{achieved}} {{stability in}} the West, Alexios could turn {{his attention to the}} severe economic difficulties and <b>the</b> <b>disintegration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empire's traditional defences. However, he still did not have enough manpower to recover the lost territories in Asia Minor and to advance against the Seljuks. At the Council of Piacenza in 1095, envoys from Alexios spoke to Pope Urban II about the suffering of the Christians of the East, and underscored that without help from the West they would continue to suffer under Muslim rule.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius {{advanced}} {{along the}} Araxes River, destroying Persian-held Dvin, {{the capital of}} Armenia, and Nakhchivan. At Ganzaka, Heraclius met Khosrow's army, some 40,000 strong. Using loyal Arabs, he captured and killed some of Khosrow's guards, leading to <b>the</b> <b>disintegration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Persian army. Heraclius then destroyed the famous fire temple of Takht-i-Suleiman, an important Zoroastrian shrine. Heraclius' raids {{went as far as}} the Gayshawan, a residence of Khosrow in Adurbadagan.|$|E

5|$|Kalonji's {{accession}} {{to the position}} of Mulopwe was heavily criticised even by many Luba in South Kasai. Kalonji remained popular among some groups, but lost the support of the South Kasaian évolués who saw his elevation as flagrant opportunism. Soon after his elevation, Kalonji was publicly condemned and disavowed by ten of South Kasai's 13 representatives in the Léopoldville parliament, beginning <b>the</b> <b>disintegration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secessionist state.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear envelope's {{structure}} {{is determined by}} a network of intermediate filaments (protein filaments). This network is organized into lining similar to mesh called the nuclear lamina, which binds to chromatin, integral membrane proteins, and other nuclear components along the inner surface of the nucleus.

30|$|The {{regression}} coefficients are improved after annealing at 300 and 500  °C. Therefore, we attribute <b>the</b> poorer fit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prior non-annealed case to inconsistent probe-nanosheet contacts due to surface contaminants which are removed during annealing [12]. The regression coefficient at 700  °C decreased due to <b>the</b> partial <b>disintegration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nanosheet structure as discussed earlier.|$|R
5|$|Apoptosis is a {{controlled}} {{process in which}} the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and <b>the</b> <b>disintegration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of <b>the</b> <b>disintegration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, Sukhoi had been demonstrating the Su-27M to senior defence and {{government}} officials. With its debut to a Western audience at the 1992 Farnborough Airshow, the company redesignated the aircraft as Su-35. The aircraft subsequently made flying demonstrations overseas {{in an effort to}} attract export orders, starting in November 1993 with Dubai, where Viktor Pugachev flew it in a mock aerial engagement with an Su-30MK in front of spectators. The aircraft thereafter flew in Berlin and Paris, and would be a regular feature at Moscow's MAKS Air Show. The Russian government cleared the aircraft for export during Sukhoi's unsuccessful sales campaign in South Korea during the late 1990s and early 2000s; the company also marketed the aircraft to Brazil, China and the United Arab Emirates.|$|E
5|$|Cheney {{publicly}} {{expressed concern}} that nations such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, could acquire nuclear components {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet Union in 1991. The end of the Cold War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and <b>the</b> <b>disintegration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Warsaw Pact obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.|$|E

50|$|Bachorza is an {{excellent}} example of a dwór (a Polish manor house). It features all of its typical elements, such as the portico supported by a colonnade and a winged plan, which were designed in a particularly proportional manner.

5|$|Held up by {{freezing}} {{weather and}} snow storms, on 10 April, {{on the following}} day LI Infantry Corps was approaching Zagreb from the north, and bicycle-mounted troops of the 183rd Infantry Division had turned east to capture Varaždin, along with an entire Yugoslav brigade including its commanding general. On the same day, the German-installed interim Croatian government called on all Croats to stop fighting, and in the evening, LI Infantry Corps entered Zagreb and relieved the 14th Panzer Division. In the face of the assault by the 14th Panzer Division, the 4th Army quickly ceased to exist as an operational formation. <b>The</b> <b>disintegration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 4th Army was caused largely by fifth column activity, as it was involved in little fighting.|$|E
5|$|Soviet Strike is set after <b>the</b> <b>disintegration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, {{and takes}} place in a fictionalised Russia, Eastern Europe and around the Caspian Sea. The player pilots an Apache {{helicopter}} and battles with the forces of Shadowman, a renegade ex-Communist figure. Like its predecessors, the game features shooting action mixed with strategic management of fuel and ammunition, but has more authentic 3D graphics, as well as a modified overhead - as opposed to isometric - perspective. The game also features a more realistic enemy artificial intelligence and environment. Critics received the game positively, praising the graphics and full motion video, while commentary on the gameplay and difficulty was more mixed.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Damascus {{took place}} between 24 July and 29 July 1148, during the Second Crusade. It ended in a decisive crusader defeat and led to <b>the</b> <b>disintegration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crusade. The two main Christian forces that marched to the Holy Land in {{response}} to Pope Eugene III and Bernard of Clairvaux's call for the Second Crusade were led by Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany. Both faced disastrous marches across Anatolia {{in the months that}} followed, with most of their armies being destroyed. The original focus of the crusade was Edessa (Urfa), but in Jerusalem, the preferred target of King Baldwin III and the Knights Templar was Damascus. At the Council of Acre, magnates from France, Germany, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem decided to divert the crusade to Damascus.|$|E
50|$|Harding's life {{gives an}} insight into the more genteel aspects of Brisbane society before <b>the</b> turn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century. <b>The</b> {{accumulation}} <b>of</b> wealth and establishment of social credibility was important within his personal community. He was not prepared financially or personally for his death, leaving large debts and no will, which caused <b>the</b> <b>disintegration</b> <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> achievements that he had worked for, in his new country. Fortunately, his contribution to the Supreme Court Library stands as a monument to his generosity, intellect and especially his love of books.|$|R

5|$|The rest of Bruxner's {{parliamentary}} {{career was}} {{to be on the}} opposition benches, due largely to <b>the</b> <b>disintegration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger opposition party, the UAP, after the 1943 Federal election. A large number of former UAP members then formed the Democratic Party in New South Wales, led by Mair, who continued as Opposition Leader. Mair resigned as Democratic Party Leader on 10 February 1944, to be replaced by former Assembly Speaker Reginald Weaver. At the 1944 election, Bruxner's stable leadership ensured that the Country Party retained all ten of its seats in the Legislative Assembly. Bruxner retained his seat with 67.73%.|$|E
5|$|With <b>the</b> <b>disintegration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vijayanagara Empire in {{the late}} 16th and early 17th centuries, the centres of Kannada {{literature}} moved to the courts of the emerging independent kingdoms, the Kingdom of Mysore and the Keladi Nayakas. Writers in these courts, {{many of whom were}} Veerashaiva by faith, were not only adept in Kannada but often also in Sanskrit and/or Telugu. Two such writers were Kalale Nanjaraja and Kempe Gowda, the founder of Bangalore. This multi-linguality was perhaps a lingering legacy of the cosmopolitan Vijayanagara literary culture and the emerging social responsibilities of the Veerashaiva monastic order which no longer confined itself to a Kannada only audience, but rather sought to spread its influence across southern India.|$|E
5|$|As Prime Minister from 14 January 1991 to 22 August 1991 Pavlov {{initiated}} the 1991 Soviet monetary reform, {{commonly referred to}} as the Pavlov reform, in early 1991. Early on he told the media that the reform was initiated to halt the flow of Soviet roubles transported to the Soviet Union from abroad. Although ridiculed at the time, the statement was later proven to be true. In June the same year, Pavlov called for a transfer of power from the President of the Soviet Union to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers. When that failed, he joined a plot to oust Gorbachev. In August, he participated in the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, which tried to prevent <b>the</b> <b>disintegration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union.
