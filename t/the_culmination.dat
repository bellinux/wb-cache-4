It took place in and around the Saudi Arabian city of Khafji, from 29 January to 1 February 1991 and marked <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> of the Coalition's air campaign over Kuwait and Iraq, which had begun on 17 January 1991.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrest and}} {{assassination}} of Ngô Đình Diệm, {{the president of}} South Vietnam, marked <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> of a successful CIA-backed coup d'état led by General Dương Văn Minh in November 1963. On 2 November 1963, Diệm and his adviser, his younger brother Ngô Đình Nhu, were arrested after the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) had been successful in a bloody overnight siege on Gia Long Palace in Saigon. The coup was <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> of nine years of autocratic and nepotistic family rule in South Vietnam. Discontent with the Diệm regime had been simmering below the surface, and exploded with mass Buddhist protests against long-standing religious discrimination after the government shooting of protesters who defied {{a ban on the}} flying of the Buddhist flag.|$|E

40|$|From the Palacozoic to the Cretaceous, crustal {{thinning}} in the Mid Norway {{area was}} associated with the denudation of gneiss-cored culminations and metamorphic core complexes in the footwalls of major extensional faults. The development of <b>the</b> <b>culminations</b> led to warping and deactivation of early detachments, to the nucleation of new faults in more distal positions and to the exhumation of highgrade metamorphic rocks to more shallow levels in the crust. Some of <b>the</b> <b>culminations</b> and core complexes became part of the erosional template in Mid-Late Palaeozoic time, some were probably exhumed in the Mesozoic, whereas some may never have reached the surface. We present an overview of five types of gneiss-cored culminations and core complexes that have been identified in the field, through the interpretation of offshore, long-offset seismic reflection data. We furthermore address their mechanism(s) of formation, and their role in the progressive evolution of the Mid-Norwegian margin...|$|R
50|$|Isla Margarita eastern {{is formed}} by a {{mountain}} range which runs roughly north-south direction, from northern Porlamar to Cabo Negro; north {{from the town}} of El Espinal the massif rises steeply to <b>the</b> <b>culminations</b> of San Juan and Copey hill, showing heights of 960 and 890 m respectively. The hills are Matasite and Guayamurí Los Andes foothills. To the north stands the Tragaplata hill.|$|R
50|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>culminations</b> of <b>the</b> plot is the {{decision}} by the people of Islandia to reject the demands of the Great Powers for unrestricted trade and immigration, choosing instead to maintain their tradition of isolation. As this political struggle intensifies, John Lang sympathizes with the Islandians, to the great disappointment of many American businessmen who desire new lucrative trade opportunities, including John Lang's uncle.|$|R

5|$|A {{more recent}} theory, with broad support among archaeologists, is that Celtic culture and {{language}} arrived in Ireland {{as a result}} of cultural diffusion. This theory proposes that the Celticisation of Ireland may have been <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> of a long process of social and economic interaction between Ireland, Britain and adjacent parts of Continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|Although {{contemporary}} historians vilified Domitian {{after his}} death, his administration provided {{the foundation for}} the peaceful empire of the 2nd century CE, and <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> of the 'Pax Romana'. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, but in reality their policies differed little from Domitian's. Much more than a gloomy coda to the 1st century, the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96, in a reign which Theodor Mommsen described as the sombre but intelligent despotism of Domitian.|$|E
50|$|As of June 28, 2006, 150 mi of {{continuous}} four-lane divided highway is open between Starkville, Mississippi, and Jackson, Mississippi. The last leg to open was the 11.9 mi, $27-million section from {{the intersection of}} Highway 19 north of Louisville, Mississippi, to Noxapater Creek in Winston County. This is one of <b>the</b> <b>culminations</b> of <b>the</b> 1987 Four-Lane Highway Program (commonly referred to as AHEAD Program) for improving Mississippi roadways.|$|R

5|$|During {{the last}} years of his career, {{dedicated}} almost exclusively to the Sagrada Família, Gaudí reached <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> of this naturalistic style, creating a synthesis of all of the solutions and styles he had tried until then.

50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>culminations</b> of Franco-German enmity in both world wars, the two {{actively}} gave {{up their}} mutual animosities {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century. The most prominent symbol of this development is the picture of heads of government François Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl holding each other's hands at a ceremony at the military cemetery in Verdun in 1984. Today, Germany and France are close political partners and two closely connected nations. A joint Franco-German television network, Arte, was founded in 1992.|$|R
5|$|In 1980, Ray made {{a sequel}} to Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, a {{somewhat}} political Hirak Rajar Deshe (Kingdom of Diamonds). The kingdom of the evil Diamond King, or Hirok Raj, is an allusion to India during Indira Gandhi's emergency period. Along with his acclaimed short film Pikoo (Pikoo's Diary) and hour-long Hindi film, Sadgati, this was <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> of his work in this period.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Samsung's Chairman Lee Kun-hee {{recognised}} {{the automotive industry}} as <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> of several others. For the Samsung Group, this would allow to leverage resources and technologies from the entire group including Samsung Electrics and Samsung Electronics. He initially tried {{to take control of}} Kia, but competition from other bidders and legal restrictions made him to drop the idea. Kia was eventually purchased by Hyundai.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} nineteenth century, the {{emphasis}} of Imperial defence policy had shifted from a single centralised Army and Navy to an approach whereby the self-governing Dominions began to provide forces for their own defence, and to begin {{to take responsibility for}} strategic interests and bases in their own geographic areas. <b>The</b> <b>culmination</b> of this was the South African War, where contingents from the Dominion militaries had played a significant role.|$|E

5000|$|Whitwell’s {{reputation}} as an architect has not withstood the test of time, and his texts have either been lost or {{had little or no}} influence, but his design for New Harmony has been revisited as one of <b>the</b> <b>culminations</b> of early 19th-century Utopian experimentation in the United States. The proliferation of new communities with emphasis on either religious or secular collective living reached its high point as Whitwell was producing his design for New Harmony. However, none displayed such a graphic interpretation of their own philosophy as Whitwell’s famous perspective did.|$|R
5|$|Judgment Day {{provided}} <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> {{of various}} scripted plots and storylines. A {{month before the}} event, several professional wrestling matches and scripted plots were played out on WWE programming (Raw, Friday Night SmackDown!, and ECW on Sci Fi) to create feuds between various wrestlers, casting them as villains and heroes. Raw, SmackDown, and ECW were also the names of WWE's televised brands– a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a specific program, thus each brand promoted distinct matches.|$|E
5|$|Ragtime was a {{style of}} dance music based around the piano, using syncopated rhythms and chromaticisms; the genre's most {{well-known}} performer and composer was undoubtedly Scott Joplin. Donald Clarke considers ragtime <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> of coon songs, used first in minstrel shows and then vaudeville, {{and the result of}} the rhythms of minstrelsy percolating into the mainstream; he also suggests that ragtime's distinctive sound may have come from an attempt to imitate the African American banjo using the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|Survivor Series was <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> {{of various}} scripted plots and storylines. For {{three months before}} the event, several {{professional}} wrestling matches and scripted plots were played out on WWE programming (Raw, Friday Night SmackDown!, and ECW on Sci Fi) to create feuds between various wrestlers, casting them as villains and heroes. Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW were also the names of WWE's televised brands– a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a specific program, thus each brand promoted distinct matches.|$|E

5000|$|Determinism is a {{philosophical}} concept often confused with fate, {{it can be}} defined as the notion that all intents/actions are causally determined by <b>the</b> <b>culminations</b> of an agent’s existing circumstances; simply put, everything that happens is determined by things that have already happened. Determinism differs from fate in that it is never conceived as being a spiritual, religious, nor astrological notion; fate is typically thought of as being [...] "given" [...] or [...] "decreed" [...] while determinism is [...] "caused." [...] Influential philosophers like Robert Kane (philosopher), Thomas Nagel, Roderick Chisholm, and A.J. Ayer have written about this notion.|$|R
