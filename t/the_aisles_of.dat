5|$|<b>The</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> {{the choir}} {{previously}} both extended {{on either side}} of the Lady Chapel. The south aisle was shortened in about 1870 by George Gilbert Scott, and given an apsidal east end, becoming the chapel of StErasmus. The eastern end of the north aisle contains the chapel of St Werburgh.|$|E
5|$|The vault of {{the nave}} rises steeply {{in a simple}} quadripartite form, {{in harmony with the}} nave arcade. The eastern end of the choir was {{extended}} and the whole upper part elaborated {{in the second quarter of}} the 14th century by William Joy. The vault has a multiplicity of ribs in a net-like form, which is very different from that of the nave, and is perhaps a recreation in stone of a local type of compartmented wooden roof of which examples remain from the 15th century, including those at St Cuthbert's Church, Wells. The vaults of <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> the choir also have a unique pattern.|$|E

One flight attendant, Hermis Moutardier, walked <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> the plane to assess the source. She found Reid sitting alone near a window, {{attempting}} to light a match. Moutardier warned him that smoking was not allowed on the airplane, and Reid promised to stop.|$|E

The leased Boeing 737-800 have no personal TV but overhead TV's located in <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> the plane and feature a seat pitch of 29-30inches.

25|$|The {{building}} is of two storeys of ashlar masonry, above a basement, {{and surrounded by}} a balustrade above the upper cornice. The balustrade was added, against Wren's wishes, in 1718. The internal bays are marked externally by paired pilasters with Corinthian capitals at the lower level and Composite at the upper level. Where the building behind is of only one storey (at <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> both nave and choir) the upper storey of the exterior wall is sham. It serves a dual purpose of supporting the buttresses of the vault, and providing a satisfying appearance when viewed rising above buildings of {{the height of the}} 17th century city. This appearance may still be seen from across the River Thames.|$|E
500|$|The mascot is [...] "NJ Devil", a [...] tall devil {{who plays}} into {{the myth of}} the Jersey Devil. NJ Devil keeps the crowd excited, signs autographs, participates in {{entertainment}} during the intermissions, skates across the ice, throws T-shirts and runs throughout <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> the arena to high five fans. Prior to 1993, the mascot was [...] "Slapshot", a large Devils hockey puck that interacted with the fans. The man inside the costume resigned after he was accused of touching three women inappropriately while in costume. The man agreed to undergo psychological counseling for a year as part of his agreement to avoid trial. To remove the stigma of the lawsuit, Slapshot was retired and has not returned since.|$|E

500|$|According to Wong, {{the idea}} of using a roller-coaster {{derailment}} as the opening-scene disaster came from New Line Cinema executive Richard Bryant and was not inspired by a Big Thunder Mountain Railroad incident. The idea of death omens in photographs was taken from The Omen (1976). Morgan revealed he searched <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> a local store at Sunset Boulevard for days to get inspiration regarding Erin's death at the hardware store. According to Morgan, the loss of control was a major theme that he and Wong had envisioned from the very beginning for the film; this is exemplified by both Wendy, who is afraid of losing control, as well as the roller coaster. He stated {{that one of the reasons}} people are afraid of roller coasters is because, according to psychologists, [...] " [...] have no control" [...] while on them.|$|E
500|$|Valentino played leading {{roles in}} {{fourteen}} films as a romantic figure. When {{he appeared in}} The Sheik in 1921, women fainted in <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> theaters; the film grossed $1.5million. His second wife, Natacha Rambova, took increasing control of his career and image, although this meant his screen image turned [...] "increasingly effeminate". The films in which he played a romantic role within the action genre were the more successful at the box office; these included his final two works The Eagle (1925) and The Son of the Sheik (1926). In 1995 The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse {{was inducted into the}} United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"; a second Valentino film was inducted in 2003 when The Son of the Sheik was selected.|$|E

2500|$|The {{construction}} {{did not go}} to plan, however, {{with work}} having to be halted in 1877 {{due to a lack of}} funds. The following years saw more problems, with Bishop Sillani dying in Rome in 1878, and Fr. Tabarrani leaving Ceylon in 1880 (and dying just two years later in Rome). Nevertheless, May 1880 saw Fr. Bonifiglio Baldoni take charge of the project, the four planned arches being completed by the end of August. Nearly a year later, [...] "at 11.00, the last keystone was driven in place.” The work on most of the main portion of the cathedral, despite the many problems in funding, had been completed. The church celebrated [...] "the Great Day", with Bishop Clement Pagnani (now Vicar Apostolic of Colombo) blessing the nave and <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> the new Cathedral and opening it for public worship. The highlight of the day was the first Holy Mass offered for the benefactors of the Cathedral.|$|E

2500|$|From December 26 to December 31, 1969, Weatherman {{held the}} last of its National Council {{meetings}} in Flint, Michigan. Flying to the event, Dohrn and Jacobs ran up and down <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> the airplane, seizing food, frightening the passengers. The meeting, dubbed the [...] "War Council" [...] by the 400 people who attended, adopted Jacobs' call for violent revolution. Dohrn opened the conference by telling the delegates they needed to stop being afraid and begin the [...] "armed struggle." [...] Reminding the delegates {{of the murder of}} Sharon Tate and four others on August 9, 1969 by members of the Manson Family. [...] "Dig it," [...] Dohrn said approvingly. [...] "First they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner {{in the same room with}} them, they even shoved a fork into a victim’s stomach! Wild!" [...] She then held up three fingers in what she called the [...] "Manson fork salute." [...] Over the next five days, the participants met in informal, random groups to discuss what [...] "going underground" [...] meant, how best to organize collectives, and justifications for violence. In the evening, the groups reconvened for a mass [...] "wargasm"—practicing karate, engaging in physical exercise, singing songs, and listening to speeches. The [...] "War Council" [...] ended with a major speech by John Jacobs. J.J. condemned the [...] "pacifism" [...] of white middle-class American youth, a belief which they held because they were insulated from the violence which afflicted blacks and the poor. He predicted a successful revolution, and declared that youth were moving away from passivity and apathy and toward a new high-energy culture of [...] "repersonalization" [...] brought about by drugs, sex, and armed revolution. [...] "We're against everything that's 'good and decent' in honky America," [...] Jacobs said in his most oft-quoted statement. [...] "We will burn and loot and destroy. We are the incubation of your mother's nightmare." ...|$|E
