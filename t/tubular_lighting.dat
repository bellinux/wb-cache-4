40|$|Light pipes (such as <b>tubular</b> <b>lighting)</b> {{are simple}} {{structures}} {{that allow the}} transmission of daylight from outside to inside a room. They are an increasingly popular product, with CIBSE Building Journal (September 2003) stating {{that there are now}} an estimated three million pipes installed throughout the globe. They generally consist of a top collector (often just a polycarbonate hemispheric dome), the pipe itself, and an emitter. Light pipes have different designs and are constantly being improved and updated. Much of the work discussed here considers pipes of reflective aluminium sheets (96 % reflectance) that transmits light through multiple specular reflection, but more reflective films are now available that produce even better performances. For example, a film developed by 3 M has a reflectance of 98 - 99 %, with the light transmitted via total internal reflection. Such innovations make the light-pipe increasingly efficient, {{but it is important to}} quantify this effectiveness by producing reliable predictive methods. The following article, as part of the CIE international technical committee TC 3 - 38 contribution, provides a review of such models/methods and their applications. ...|$|E

The physical model of the tested light guides of lengths more than 0. 60 m proves shows that Rayleigh numbers are adequate for a turbulent air flow. The turbulent model was applied despite the small heat flux differences between the turbulent and laminar model. The CFD simulations resulted into conclusions that the growing ratio of length/diameter increases the heat transmission loss/linear transmittance as much as by 50 percent. <b>Tubular</b> <b>light</b> guides of smaller diameters have lower heat transmission losses compared to the wider ones of the same lengths with the same outdoor temperature being taken into account.

However, architects and designers had been preoccupied with the concept for some time. The German term Lichtarchitektur (light architecture) first appears in print in a 1927 essay by Joachim Teichmüller in Licht und Lampe, another technical electrical publication, but he had used it as a wall label at an exhibition five months before, and there was a lengthy preceding history of more or less metaphysical discussion in Germany of [...] "crystalline" [...] architecture, the [...] "dissolution" [...] of cities, and the concept of the Stadtkrone (city crown), particularly among the members of the Gläserne Kette (Glass Chain). (Louis I. Kahn held a similarly metaphysical view, saying in 1973 in his lecture at Pratt Institute that [...] "light is really the source of all being".) In his essay, Teichmüller distinguishes between lighting design and light architecture, which will only come about through integration of the lighting engineer's concerns with those of the architect so that the [...] "space-shaping power of light" [...] itself is realized: [...] "This architectural light can lead to light architecture if with it, and only with it, specific architectural effects are produced, which appear and disappear simultaneously with the light." [...] Also in 1927, Max Landsberg wrote that commercial centers now presented such different aspects by day and night that architecture of the day and of the night should be distinguished. He argued for [...] "not only regulations, but planning and competitions" [...] to facilitate the development of the latter and bring order to the current chaos of advertising. That same year, Hugo Häring foresaw the [...] "nocturnal face" [...] of architecture soon eclipsing the [...] "diurnal face." [...] And also that same year, Walter Behrendt devoted a section in his book Sieg des neuen Baustils (translated edition: The Victory of the New Building Style) to [...] "artificial illumination as a problem of form" [...] and defined one of the tasks of new building as being:not only to use these new possibilities electric lighting but also to design them, whereupon illumination is exploited in a functional sense, that is, it becomes an effective tool for designing the space, explaining the spatial function and movement, and accentuating and strengthening the spatial relations and tensions.

The local volumetric rate of photon absorption (LVRPA) in the reactors was evaluated by the six-flux absorption scattering model (SFM). The Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model of the degradation of a model contaminant on irradiated aqueous suspensions of TiO 2 P 25 and Ag@TiO 2 was combined with the SFM radiation model and light emission models to determine local reaction rates, and further integrated with the reactors hydrodynamics and material balances to model the degradation of 2 -HBA in the photoreactors. The linear source spherical emission (LSSE) and extensive source superficial diffuse emission (ESSDE) models were compared in terms of incident and transmitted photon fluxes through the reactor. It was shown that both LSSE and ESSDE models could be successfully applied for the modeling of annular and flat reactors, considering the emission from <b>tubular</b> fluorescent <b>light</b> sources. Since current research calls for materials with wide absorption in the solar radiation spectrum, spanning from the UV to the visible, therefore, the SFM model was adapted to consider such wide distribution. The optical properties of the photocatalysts were averaged over narrow wavelength ranges of the solar spectrum, wherein the contributions by the UVA, UVB and visible light irradiation to the LVRPA and contaminant degradation rate were separated. The effects of catalyst concentration, liquid velocity profile and the photon flux from different light sources on the 2 -HBA degradation rate were explored.

In addition, mice deficient in complement factor B, a necessary component of the alternative pathway, are protected from ischemic acute renal failure. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether alternative pathway activation also occurs during the development of ischemic acute {{tubular necrosis}} in the human kidney. MethodsBiopsies were identified from nine patients with morphologically normal kidneys and seven patients with evidence of acute <b>tubular</b> necrosis by <b>light</b> microscopy. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to quantify and localize the complement activation products C 3 d and C 4 d. The results were correlated with available clinical data. ResultsSimilar to mice, small amounts of activated C 3 d were present along the tubular basement membrane in normal kidneys. However, kidneys from patients with acute tubular necrosis had C 3 d complement deposition along a significantly greater number of tubules, and many of the tubules were completely circumscribed. In contrast, C 4 d was not detectable, indicating that complement activation occurred primarily via alternative pathway activation. ConclusionComplement activation occurs in human ischemic acute tubular necrosis.

To test molecular based renal disease categorization, differential gene expression profiles were compared between control and hydronephrotic kidneys showing varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis. MethodsRNA expression profiles from 9 hydronephrotic and 3 control kidneys were analyzed using small macroarrays dedicated to genes involved in cell-cell contact, matrix turnover, and inflammation. In parallel, the degree of tubulointerstitial inflammation, fibrosis, and <b>tubular</b> atrophy using <b>light</b> microscopy and quantitative immunohistochemical parameters was determined. ResultsHierarchic clustering and self-organizing maps led to a gene expression dendrogram with three distinct nodes representing the control group, four kidneys with high inflammation, and five kidneys giving high fibrosis scores. To evaluate the clinical applicability of the marker set, the expression of nine genes (6 Ckine, IL- 8, MMP- 9, MMP- 3, MMP- 7, urokinase R, CXCR 5, integrin-β 4, and pleiotrophin) was tested in tubulointerstitial samples from routine renal biopsies. Seven mRNA markers showed differential regulation in inflammation and fibrosis in the biopsy population. Clinical follow-up revealed stringent correlation between gene expression data and progression of renal disease, and allowed segregation of the biopsies into progressive or stable disease course based on gene expression profiles. ConclusionThis study suggests the feasibility of gene expression–based disease categorization in human nephropathies based on the extraction of marker gene sets...|$|R
40|$|With {{the notion}} of {{evolving}} current Extended Reach Drilling, this master thesis examines if drilling 20 – 40 km is feasible. Several reservoirs offshore in the area outside of Lofoten {{in the northern part}} of Norway are reachable by 20 – 40 km in horizontal displacement. The term for these excessive lengths is Ultra Extended Reach Drilling (UL–ERD) and is the foundation for this master thesis. To solve this task a "‘Well Path and Drilling Software"’ (WP&D software) is developed to simulate the drilling operation with regard to well path, drilling, running of casing/liner and well service using wire line. Three–dimensional well path design, analysis of loads and stresses experienced, torque and drag calculation and hydraulic calculation used in the software are presented in this master thesis. Attaining UL-ERD demands innovation in all areas of drilling technology. This thesis addresses this by simulating different scenarios in the software, presenting and discussing the results. The well path designed needs least possible dog–legs and azimuthal change to avoid increased frictional forces and contribution from the capstan effect. Drilling with different drill pipe materials like steel, titanium and composite shows the advantage of using lighter materials to reduce torque and drag. The hydraulic requirements to pump down the string is overcome by having 700 bars of working pressure available on mud pumps and the use of large inner diameter of drill pipe. High Equivalent Circulating Densities (ECD) are handled by Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) and its Applied Back Pressure (ABP). The flow rate used to maintain a constant annular velocity is valid if hole cleaning is fulfilled throughout the well. Larger inner diameter requires larger outer diameter which leads to excessive ECDs in small holes. Large diameter drilled holes with corresponding casing/linerOD sizes in parenthesis; 36 "(30 "), 26 "(20 "), 17 1 / 2 "(13 3 / 8 "), 17 1 / 2 "(13 3 / 8 " and 12 1 / 4 "(95 / 8 "). Expandable casing is used to have two lengths of 13 3 / 8 " liner intervals giving the ability of using large inner and outer diameter drill pipe. Setting of casing/liner is performed conventionally using casing/liner filled with mud and unconventionally with fully evacuated casing/liner with nitrogen or casing/liner with mud over nitrogen. The snubbing unit is assumed dimensioned to handle 100 tonnes to get casing/liner down. Rotation of the liner is possible when the absolute density is close to the mud weight in the hole, giving a reduced buoyant weight. Different simulation of inner and outer diameter dimension of drill pipe concludes that an 8 "outer diameter and 7 " inner diameter is the best option for UL-ERD in this thesis. This, incombination of a lighter material such as composite, leads to 40882 meters Measured Depth(MD) at 2506 meters True Vertical Depth (TVD), Horizontal Displacement (HD) of 39501 meters and a Step–Out–ratio of 15, 7. It also has a slight azimuthal change in the well path. The mud pumps deliver 700 bars and the proper flow rate to clean the wellbore using MPD. The casing/liner reaches setting depth and it is possible to run composite wire line with welltractor to perform well service, through the production tubing. Torque and drag calculationsare valid for the specified Make-Up Torque (MUT) of approximately 85 kN. The max limit of 100 kN MUT can be handled by using a tapered drill string. 5 7 / 8 " drill pipe with either steel, titanium or composite can be used to drill multiple wells and join them together to achieve one UL–ERD well. Steel drill pipe is be most preferable with regard to availability and cost. Larger <b>tubular</b> with <b>light</b> drill string material is beneficial when it comes to reducing torque and drag and hydraulic issues in these shorter wells. Obtaining UL–ERD wells in this way requires less modification with regard to the drilling process, since lengths drilled are shorter. The disadvantage is that in a somewhat pristine area as Lofoten, the Health Safety Environment (HSE) issues with drilling offshore is a valid obstacle for not choosing this solution here. This thesis recommends that when having solved the issues with torque and drag, hydraulicrequirement and available equipment, reaching UL–ERD can be performed by drilling fromone location on land, or with multiple wells from several locations on and off land joined into one well. An 8 " composite drill pipe with 7 " inner diameter could be used, lightening the casing/liner to get to setting depth and use composite wire line to perform well service. Recommendations are made on the basis of mud pumps delivering sufficient pump pressure,stronger snubbing units, use of expandable casing, torque and drag is being handled, large hole diameters, larger inner and outer diameters of tubular, the use of a tapered drill string,development and innovation of equipment found vital for the task. </p...|$|R
