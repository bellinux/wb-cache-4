40|$|The ongoing {{confusion}} {{about the meaning of}} ‘talent’ within the world of work is hindering the establishment of widely accepted <b>talent</b> management theories and practices. The aim {{of this paper is to}} contribute to the literature on <b>talent</b> management by offering an indepth review of the <b>talent</b> concept within the specific context of the world of work, and proposing a framework for its conceptualization. We group different theoretical approaches to <b>talent</b> into ‘object’ (i. e., <b>talent</b> as natural ability; <b>talent</b> as mastery; <b>talent</b> as commitment; <b>talent</b> as fit) versus ‘subject’ approaches (i. e., <b>talent</b> as all people; <b>talent</b> as some people) and identify dynamics existing within and between them, as well as implications for <b>talent</b> management theory and practice. Finally, we discuss different avenues for further research aimed at developing the talent—and consequently, the <b>talent</b> management—construct further. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Talent</b> {{allocation}} models {{assume that}} entrepreneurial <b>talent</b> is selfish and thus allocates into unproductive or even destructive activities if these offer the highest private returns. This paper experimentally analyzes other-regarding preferences of entrepreneurial <b>talent.</b> We find that making {{a distinction between}} creative <b>talent</b> and business <b>talent</b> explains systematic differences in other-regarding behavior. Generally, business <b>talent</b> is less willing, and creative <b>talent</b> more willing, to forego private payoffs to avoid losses to others. A moderator analysis reveals that uncreative business <b>talent</b> is significantly less other-regarding than creative business <b>talent,</b> a finding applicable to both certain and risky payoffs with and without negative externalities.
