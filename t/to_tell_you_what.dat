500|$|Aguilera further commented {{about the}} event with USA Today, [...] "When you're {{part of a}} pop phenomenon, {{you have so many}} {{opinions}} shoved down your throat. People try <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> you should do, how you should act, what you should wear, who you should be with. At the time things started happening for me, it was popular to be the squeaky-clean, cookie-cutter pop singer. But that role didn't speak to me, because it's so boring and superficial".|$|E

Reflecting on the mistake in Sweden that turned the championship around, Rainey says: “It’s really hard <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I feel like.

Burns was also hurt politically when he confronted a U.S. Forest Service Hotshot Crew from Virginia at an airport about a fire.|$|E

On August 10, 2009, at a public event in Kinshasa, a Congolese student asked her what her husband, [...] "Mr Clinton", thought of a Chinese trade deal with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Clinton looked irritated at the question and replied, [...] "Wait, you want me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> my husband thinks? My husband is not the secretary of state, I am.
