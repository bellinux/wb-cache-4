5|$|Shortly {{after making}} {{the choice to}} include {{electronic}} drums and triggers, Peart added what has become another <b>trademark</b> <b>of</b> his kit: a rotating drum riser. During live Rush shows the riser allows Peart to swap the prominent portions of the kit (traditional acoustic in front, electronic in back). A staple of Peart's live drum solos has been the in-performance rotation-and-swap of {{the front and back}} kits as part of the solo itself. This special effect provides both a symbolic transition of drum styles within the solo and a visual treat for the audience.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} {{releasing}} unauthorised performances {{had been established}} before the 20th century, but reached new levels of popularity with Bob Dylan's Great White Wonder, a compilation of studio outtakes and demos released in 1969 using low-priority pressing plants. The following year, the Rolling Stones' Live'r Than You'll Ever Be, an audience recording of a late 1969 show, received a positive review in Rolling Stone. Subsequent bootlegs became more sophisticated in packaging, particularly the <b>Trademark</b> <b>of</b> Quality label with William Stout's cover artwork. Compact disc bootlegs {{first appeared in the}} 1980s, and internet distribution became increasingly popular in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{marketing}} and <b>trademark</b> <b>of</b> Dota as a franchise by Valve gained concern and {{opposition from the}} DotA Allstars contributors working at Riot Games, as well as Blizzard Entertainment, both of which legally opposed the franchising of Dota by Valve. The legal dispute was conceded in May 2012, with Valve gaining undisputed franchising rights for commercial use to the trademark, while non-commercial use remains open to the public. Dota 2 was officially released in July 2013.|$|E

5|$|Despite initial doubts by Nintendo's American staff, Donkey Kong succeeded commercially and {{critically}} in North America and Japan. Nintendo licensed {{the game to}} Coleco, who developed home console versions for numerous platforms. Other companies cloned Nintendo's hit and avoided royalties altogether. Miyamoto's characters appeared on cereal boxes, television cartoons, {{and dozens of other}} places. A lawsuit brought on by Universal City Studios, alleging Donkey Kong violated their <b>trademark</b> <b>of</b> King Kong, ultimately failed. The success of Donkey Kong and Nintendo's victory in the courtroom helped to position the company for video game market dominance from its release in 1981 until the late 1990s (1996–1999).|$|E

The distinctive red double-decker buses are an internationally recognised <b>trademark</b> <b>of</b> London transport along with black cabs and the Tube.|$|E
5|$|Palladio {{would often}} model his villa {{elevations}} on Roman temple facades. The temple influence, {{often in a}} cruciform design, later became a <b>trademark</b> <b>of</b> his work. Palladian villas are usually built with three floors: a rusticated basement or ground floor, containing the service and minor rooms. Above this, the piano nobile accessed through a portico reached by a flight of external steps, containing the principal reception and bedrooms, and above it is a low mezzanine floor with secondary bedrooms and accommodation. The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5, and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios. Earlier architects had used these formulas for balancing a single symmetrical facade; however, Palladio's designs related to the whole, usually square, villa.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, members {{helped to}} sponsor job training, reading enrichment, {{heritage}} and youth programs. By encouraging youth to improve math, science, and reading skills, the sorority continued {{a legacy of}} community service and pledged to enrich the lives of others. Financially, Alpha Kappa Alpha expanded funding for projects in 1953 through the creation and <b>trademark</b> <b>of</b> a fashion show called Fashionetta. Politically, ACHR continued lobbying for equality concerning civil rights during the 1950s and 1960s. According to Collier-Thomas, the ACHR drew attention to legislation concerning education, transportation, employment, and improving equality {{in the armed forces}} and public places. The ACHR participated in filing civil rights cases in amicus curiae with Bolling v. Sharpe and 1954's Brown v. Board of Education. However, as a whole, ACHR voted to dissolve operations in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Warcraft: Orcs & Humans was a {{moderate}} critical and commercial success, {{and laid the}} ground for Blizzard's style of RTS, in which personality was a distinctive element. The increasingly humorous responses to clicking a unit repeatedly became a <b>trademark</b> <b>of</b> the company. Warcraft: Orcs & Humans introduced characters that also appeared in the enormously successful massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft. The company's manuals presented detailed backstories and artwork. StarCraft used a futuristic theme, but placed the same emphasis on characterization. In all the Blizzard RTS games and in World of Warcraft, units must be managed carefully, rather than treated as expendable hordes. Blizzard has produced fewer expansion packs than Westwood, but integrated the story of each with its predecessors.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of The Legend of Boggy Creek, Pierce was {{encouraged}} to film a sequel, but resisted {{because he wanted to}} prove himself as a filmmaker rather than duplicate the same idea. He continued to make inexpensive regional films set in the southern United States, primarily targeting small-town and rural audiences. His family said Pierce liked to be continuously working and would start a new film immediately after finishing the last. His sophomore effort was Bootleggers (1974), a period action-comedy film about rival families making moonshine in the Ozark Mountains. It featured Slim Pickens and the first major performance of Jaclyn Smith, who went on to play Kelly Garrett in the television series Charlie's Angels. Pierce followed that film up with two Westerns released in 1976. The first, Winterhawk, was about violence erupting between Blackfoot Native Americans and white villagers. The film proved difficult for Pierce to shoot due to challenges from the weather and problems with the horses on the set. However, according to Pierce, Winterhawk was more widely seen than The Legend of Boggy Creek. His second Western was Winds of Autumn. Pierce co-wrote both films with his Boggy Creek partner, Earl E. Smith. Pierce made a <b>trademark</b> <b>of</b> casting his friends in his films, and Pierce himself performed minor roles in both Winterhawk and Winds of Autumn. During this period, Pierce continued working as a set decorator for films such as Black Belt Jones (1974).|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, sugar {{shortages}} during World War I hurt {{sales of}} Archibald Query's Marshmallow Creme, so Query sold his recipe in 1920 to two men from Swampscott, Massachusetts, H. Allen Durkee and Fred L. Mower, who began distributing the product through their company, Durkee-Mower Inc. The pair renamed the product Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff, and Durkee-Mower continues {{to sell the}} product under the name Marshmallow Fluff. The sandwich made with peanut butter and marshmallow fluff continued to be eaten, but was not called a Fluffernutter until 1960, when an advertising firm Durkee-Mower hired created the term as a more effective way to market the sandwich. Fluffernutter is a registered <b>trademark</b> <b>of</b> Durkee-Mower, although the company's U.S. trademark registrations for the term cover only ice cream and printed recipes. In 2006, Durkee-Mower sued Williams-Sonoma Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Williams-Sonoma infringed on its trademark by selling a marshmallow and peanut butter chocolate-covered candy under the Fluffernutter name.|$|E
5|$|The Palladian, Serlian, or Venetian window {{features}} {{largely in}} Palladio's work and {{is almost a}} <b>trademark</b> <b>of</b> his early career. It consists of a central light with semicircular arch over, carried on an impost consisting of a small entablature, under which, and enclosing two other lights, one on each side, are pilasters. In the library at Venice, Sansovino varied the design by substituting columns for the two inner pilasters. To describe its origin as being either Palladian or Venetian is not accurate; the motif was first used by Donato Bramante and later mentioned by Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554) in his seven-volume architectural book Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva expounding the ideals of Vitruvius and Roman architecture, this arched window is flanked by two lower rectangular openings, a motif that {{first appeared in the}} triumphal arches of ancient Rome. Palladio used the motif extensively, most notably in the arcades of the Basilica Palladiana in Vicenza. It is also a feature of his entrances to both Villa Godi and Villa Forni Cerato. It is perhaps this extensive use of the motif in the Veneto that has given the window its alternative name of the Venetian window; it is also known as a Serlian window. Whatever the name or the origin, this form of window has probably {{become one of the most}} enduring features of Palladio's work seen in the later architectural styles evolved from Palladianism. According to James Lees-Milne, its first appearance in Britain was in the remodelled wings of Burlington House, London, where the immediate source was actually in Inigo Jones's designs for Whitehall Palace rather than drawn from Palladio himself.|$|E
