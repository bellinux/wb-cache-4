By the late morning hours of September17, an eyewall developed within the circulation, indicating that Georges was nearing hurricane-status.|$|E

5|$|During the Californication world tour, Frusciante {{continued}} to compose his own songs, {{many of which}} would be released in 2001 on his third solo album To Record Only Water for <b>Ten</b> <b>Days.</b> The album was stylistically unlike his previous records, less markedly stream-of-consciousness or avant-garde. However, the lyrics were still very cryptic and its sound was notably stripped down. The songwriting and production of To Record Only Water for <b>Ten</b> <b>Days</b> were more efficient and straightforward than on his previous recordings. The album strayed from the alternative rock he had just written with the Chili Peppers on Californication, focusing more on electronic and new wave elements. In addition to his guitar work, Frusciante experimented with a variety of synthesizers, a distinctive feature of the record.|$|E
