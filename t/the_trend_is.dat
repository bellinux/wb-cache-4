5|$|Due to {{the large}} size of the Ca2+ ion, high {{coordination}} numbers are common, up to 24 in some intermetallic compounds such as CaZn13. Calcium is readily complexed by oxygen chelates such as EDTA and polyphosphates, which are useful in analytic chemistry and removing calcium ions from hard water. In the absence of steric hindrance, smaller group 2 cations tend to form stronger complexes, but when large polydentate macrocycles are involved <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> reversed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to habitat destruction, the pygmy slow loris is seriously threatened by hunting and trade. Within its geographic range and neighbor countries, {{the trade in}} the pygmy slow loris has recently increased due to economic changes and human population growth, and <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> expected to continue. Decreased sightings {{in the field and}} at animal markets indicate that wild populations are being depleted since the low reproduction rate of the pygmy slow loris cannot keep pace with these large-scale off-takes. Accordingly, conservationists and field biologists fear local extinctions in the near future. Between 1998 and 2006, 70% of pygmy slow lorises seized by authorities died before reaching a sheltering zoo, resulting in replacement demand and additional captures from the wild.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the first}} {{electric}} railway between Retiro and Tigre was inaugurated in 1916, major electrification projects were not adopted.

After several decades of the Buenos Aires rail-service being under-funded, there is presently an ongoing modernistion plan so as to provide much needed improvement in services, and <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> towards electrification of several lines.

25|$|The {{global warming}} {{controversy}} concerns {{the public debate}} over whether global warming is occurring, how much has occurred in modern times, what has caused it, what its effects will be, whether any action {{should be taken to}} curb it, and if so what that action should be.

No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view, though a few organizations with members in extractive industries hold non-committal positions. Disputes over the key scientific facts of global warming are more prevalent in the media than in the scientific literature, where such issues are treated as resolved, and such disputes are more prevalent in the United States than globally.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> study {{examines}} <b>trends</b> in characteristics of convective and stratiform precipitation in the Czech Republic over 1982 – 2010. <b>The</b> spatially averaged <b>trends</b> in convective precipitation are rising for indices of mean precipitation, and the increases are significant in all seasons except for winter. For extremes, <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> <b>are</b> spatially much more variable and insignificant, but increases tend to prevail as well. <b>The</b> <b>trends</b> in convective precipitation are larger {{in the western}} part of the country where Atlantic influences are stronger. For characteristics of stratiform precipitation, <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> <b>are</b> usually smaller compared to those of convective precipitation, but increases prevail too. They are significant in autumn, especially for extremes, and larger in the eastern part of the country where Mediterranean cyclones play more important role. <b>The</b> <b>trends</b> in convective precipitation tend to be more pronounced at lowland than higher-elevated stations while an opposite pattern prevails for stratiform precipitation. The results suggest that in spring and summer, when convective precipitation represents an important fraction of the total amounts in central Europe (around 30 % and 50 %, respectively), the observed increases in total precipitation are mainly due to increases in convective precipitation. In autumn, increases in both convective and stratiform precipitation <b>are</b> important, and <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> <b>are</b> weakest and least pronounced in winter...|$|R
25|$|Auckland {{straddles}} the Auckland volcanic field, which has produced about 90 volcanic eruptions from 50 volcanoes {{in the last}} 90,000 years. It is the only {{city in the world}} built on a basaltic volcanic field that is still active. It is estimated that the field will stay active for about 1 million years. Surface features include cones, lakes, lagoons, islands and depressions, and several have produced extensive lava flows. Some of the cones and flows have been partly or completely quarried away. The individual volcanoes are all considered extinct, although the volcanic field itself is merely dormant. <b>The</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> for the latest eruptions to occur in the north west of the field. Auckland has at least 14 large lava tube caves which run from the volcanoes down towards the sea. Some are several kilometres long. A new suburb, Stonefields, has been built in an excavated lava flow, north west of Maungarei / Mount Wellington, that was previously used as a quarry by Winstones.|$|E
25|$|Although {{credit cards}} reached very high {{adoption}} {{levels in the}} US, Canada and the UK during the latter 20th century, many cultures were more cash-oriented or developed alternative forms of cashless payments, such as Carte bleue or the Eurocard (Germany, France, Switzerland, and others). In these places, adoption of credit cards was initially much slower. Due to strict regulations regarding bank overdrafts, some countries, France in particular, were much quicker to develop and adopt chip-based credit cards which are seen as major anti-fraud credit devices. Debit cards and online banking (using either ATMs or PCs) are used more widely than credit cards in some countries. It took until the 1990s to reach anything like the percentage market penetration levels achieved in the US, Canada, and UK. In some countries, acceptance still remains low {{as the use of}} a credit card system depends on the banking system of each country; while in others, a country sometimes had to develop its own credit card network, e.g. UK's Barclaycard and Australia's Bankcard. Japan remains a very cash-oriented society, with credit card adoption being limited mainly to the largest of merchants; although stored value cards (such as telephone cards) are used as alternative currencies, <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> toward RFID-based systems inside cards, cellphones, and other objects.|$|E
25|$|A {{professor}} of American history at Harvard University {{specializing in the}} history of gender and sexuality has researched gender roles and marriage trends for decades. Dr. Cott has testified for the plaintiffs in both United States v. Windsor and Hollingsworth v. Perry. Cott offered several examples of discriminatory practices involving marriages over the years which are no longer accepted, among them interracial marriages once being banned, American women who married foreigners once lost their citizenship and property, and the U.S. government at times not acknowledging Native American and Japanese marriages. Cott testified on February 28, 2014 that “The trend is moving toward same-sex gender neutrality/gender equality marriages; and <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> moving toward same-sex marriages.” She also testified that “The Michigan Marriage Amendment obstructs that trend from continuing.” In explaining how marriage has evolved, Cott cited the 300-year ban on interracial marriage, which was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia in 1967. Cott said marriage is a “civil contract” that only be legally sanctioned by legislatures and the courts. In addressing religious objections to same-sex marriage, she said religious authorities have no legal standing over marriages even though they are allowed to conduct marriage ceremonies. Cott testified that there have been no laws in U.S. history that made procreation a requirement for marriage, an argument used by opponents of same-sex marriage. Under cross-examination by state attorney Michelle Brya, Cott admitted the state of Michigan does have an interest in marriage {{between a man and a}} woman for population purposes and sometimes economic reasons but did not believe those two issues should stand in the way of same-sex couples legally marrying.|$|E
