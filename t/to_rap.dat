The museum will be dedicated to black musical styles, from gospel <b>to</b> <b>rap.</b> The new museum will incorporate the façade of the old South Park Presbyterian Church, where Abraham Lincoln once spoke.|$|E
5|$|KRS-One {{considered}} Run-D.M.C. {{the epitome}} of rap music in 1984 and had begun <b>to</b> <b>rap</b> following their lead. But he has also said that BDP's approach reflected {{a feeling that the}} early innovators like Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J were by 1986 tainted by commercial success and {{out of touch with the}} streets.|$|E
5|$|He {{was a most}} {{delightful}} man, {{a bizarre}} hidalgo with enormous moustachios, a flat-brimmed sombrero in the purest Spanish style, and button boots which he used <b>to</b> <b>rap</b> my shins when I didn't change the pedalling enough.... I admired him madly, because, at this time, in 1914, {{he was the only}} virtuoso who played Debussy and Ravel. That meeting with Viñes was paramount in my life: I owe him everything... In reality it is to Viñes that I owe my fledgling efforts in music and everything I know about the piano.|$|E

5|$|Dr.Dre {{has stated}} {{that he is a}} perfectionist and is known to {{pressure}} the artists with whom he records to give flawless performances. In 2006, Snoop Dogg told the website Dubcnn.com that Dr.Dre had made new artist Bishop Lamont re-record a single bar of vocals 107times. Dr.Dre has also stated that Eminem is a fellow perfectionist, and attributes his success on Aftermath to his similar work ethic. He gives a lot of input into the delivery of the vocals and will stop an MC during a take if it is not to his liking. However, he gives MCs that he works with room to write lyrics without too much instruction unless it is a specifically conceptual record, as noted by Bishop Lamont in the book How <b>to</b> <b>Rap.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late 1991, {{the group}} had the problem of having spent more money on {{production}} than was covered by returns. The group decided that its gangsta rap style was the cause: Most emcees at the time used similar styles, {{making it difficult for}} Inner City Posse to distinguish itself stylistically. Referring to local rapper Esham's horrorcore style, Bruce suggested the band adapt this genre, in a bid to have Detroit represent acid rap, much as Los Angeles represented gangsta rap. The group agreed, but not to copying the style of Esham closely. Instead, they suggested using horror-themed lyrics as an emotional outlet for all their negative life experiences. They were also unanimous in deciding not <b>to</b> <b>rap</b> openly about Satan, which Esham often did.|$|E
5|$|Daara J, {{formed in}} 1997, was {{originally}} a trio {{that consisted of}} Faada Freddy, N'Dongo D and Lord Alajiiman. Lord Alajiiman performed and toured throughout {{the world with the}} group until 2008 when the group split. Since then, Alajiman evolves in a solo career while contributing {{to the development of the}} music sector in Senegal. Daara J was formed when all of its members were in high school, where they were studying accounting. The rappers were influenced by American hip hop artists such as Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five and Afrika Bambaataa but also listened to their parents' music, which included artists such as Sly and the Family Stone and Aretha Franklin, and musical styles which included Cuban music. Faada Freddy cites the group's major inspiration as Das EFX. Originally, the members took instrumentals of hip hop tracks from the United States and France <b>to</b> <b>rap</b> over. Later they purchased a drum machine, but even with this equipment, a member of the group would have to imitate the other instruments in the song with his voice. Positive Black Soul, another Senegalese rap group, encouraged Daara J to record and perform.|$|E

25|$|Many routes at Arapiles have lower-offs, so {{they can}} be {{approached}} from above or via an easier route. There is a strong tradition dating to the '80s of bringing the route down to your level, and it is now commonplace <b>to</b> <b>rap</b> in and pre-place gear. There are many routes with a mixture of fixed and natural gear for which this approach is suitable.|$|E
25|$|Fahrenheit's songs mainly {{fall into}} the bubblegum pop and pop ballad category. However, songs like Teachable Child (孺子可教 Ru Zi Ke Jiao) and Love's Arrived (愛到 Ai Dao) are {{intended}} for a light R approach. Songs similar to The Secret of Immortality (不死之謎 Bu Si Zhi Mi) and Superb (出神入化 Chu Shen Ru Hua) are leaning toward the pop rock and rap genre, where they displayed their ability <b>to</b> <b>rap</b> and harmonize well.|$|E
25|$|Durst {{was born}} and raised in Gastonia, North Carolina. He {{graduated}} from Hunter Huss High School in 1988.

25|$|The rise of DJs {{was really}} the next step for the Japanese hip hop scene. Before 1985, there weren't very many DJs on the radio, but with the {{increase}} in the number that year, it led to the opening of the first all hip hop club in 1986. But despite the fact that DJing caught on rather quickly, it was initially thought that rapping wasn't going to have the same cache as it would be hard <b>to</b> <b>rap</b> in Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{language}} was a barrier for hip-hop in Japan. Rappers only rapped in English {{because it was}} believed that the differences between English and Japanese would make it impossible <b>to</b> <b>rap</b> in Japanese. Unlike English, the Japanese language ends phrases in auxiliary verbs. Whereas English ends in verbs or nouns, which are extremely common, Japanese rappers were limited by the small number of grammatically correct possibilities for ending a phrase. Japanese also lacks the stresses on certain syllables that provide flow to English rapping. Even traditional Japanese poetry was based on the numbers of syllables present, unlike English poetry, which was based on the stresses in a line. Most Japanese lyrical music was also formulated using textual repetition, not relying on the flow of the words.|$|E
25|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} woman (Min Hyo-rin) parking a car in a highway at night. After the woman opens her car trunk, the video flashes back to that morning where the woman was driving along a highway. Jieun {{proceeds}} to sing the first verse of the song while playing a piano in an abandoned building. Then Yongguk begins <b>to</b> <b>rap</b> in front a red wall and in a misty rice field while Jieun continues playing the piano in the abandoned building. After the interchanging shots between the three, Jieun proceeds to sing the chorus in the rice field and along with shots where she sings {{in the back seat}} of the car. After the first chorus, the woman stops the car to check her lighter, then continues driving to her destination.|$|E

25|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{uploaded}} to YouTube on 6 January 2012. The video was shot in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. In the video Lloyd sings about her jealousy and disappointment of her ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend, with the video showing Lloyd's attempts to sabotage her former love's new relationship. As Lloyd sits on her bed scanning at pictures of her and her ex, she drifts off into various schemes to drive the new couple apart. In one scene Lloyd pours {{a bottle of water}} over her former boyfriend, while in another she throws popcorn all over the loved-up pair during a trip to the cinema. Astro makes an appearance in the video <b>to</b> <b>rap</b> in the latter stages of the video, posing as her ex-boyfriend, which ends with Lloyd rather airheadedly imitating the sounds of a helicopter.|$|E
25|$|Enigma {{followed}} MCMXC a.D. with {{a series}} of albums that involved several musicians and producers working with Cretu. The first was The Cross of Changes (1993), which incorporated tribal and ethnic influences and sold over 8 million copies worldwide, followed by Le Roi est mort, vive le Roi! (1996), which blended together the Gregorian chants reminiscent from the first album and the strong intercultural soundscapes present in the second. Enigma's fourth album The Screen Behind the Mirror (2000) started a slight departure from the previous world music themes towards a heavier electronic atmosphere. This evolution culminated with Voyageur (2003), its fifth and more pop-based album, and A Posteriori (2006), a work inspired by the future collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, with distinct operatic tones and an electronic spectrum closer to Voyageur than the earlier releases. Seven Lives Many Faces (2008) followed and contained a mixture of classical and modern elements ranging from ethnic chants <b>to</b> <b>rap</b> and dubstep influences. Its eighth album, The Fall of a Rebel Angel, was released on November 2016.|$|E
