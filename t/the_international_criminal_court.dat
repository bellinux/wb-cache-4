5|$|<b>The</b> <b>International</b> <b>Criminal</b> <b>Court</b> {{investigation}} in Kenya or {{the situation in}} the Republic of Kenya is an ongoing investigation by <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Criminal</b> <b>Court</b> (ICC) into the responsibility for the 2007–2008 post-election violence in Kenya. The 2007–2008 Kenyan crisis followed the presidential election that was held on 27 December 2007. The Electoral Commission of Kenya officially declared that the incumbent President Mwai Kibaki was re-elected; supporters of the opposition candidate Raila Odinga accused the government of electoral fraud and rejected the results. A series of protests and demonstrations followed, and fighting—mainly along tribal lines—led to many deaths, injuries and displacements.|$|E

From 2003 to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U.S. interests.

5|$|Madagascar has {{historically}} been perceived as being on the margin of mainstream African affairs despite being {{a founding member of}} the Organisation of African Unity, which was established in 1963 and dissolved in 2002 to be replaced by the African Union. Madagascar was not permitted to attend the first African Union summit because of a dispute over the results of the 2001 presidential election, but rejoined the African Union in July 2003 after a 14-month hiatus. Madagascar was again suspended by the African Union in March 2009 following the unconstitutional transfer of executive power to Rajoelina.

40|$|SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN ARMED CONFLICT - THE ROLE OF <b>THE</b> <b>INTERNATIONAL</b> <b>CRIMINAL</b> COURTS <b>The</b> {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} the phenomenon of sexual violence against women in armed conflicts and to describe the influence of <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> in understanding of this phenomenon. Sexual violence appears in almost every armed conflict. Until the establishment of <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> in <b>the</b> ninetees the issue of sexual violence against women in armed conflict was overlooked. The prohibition of such treatment was existing, for example The Hague Convention or The Geneva Convention, however no efficient sanction mechanism to punish the perpetrators was existing. The violence against woman was moreover understood as her honour attack without any consequences for {{the community and the}} society as a whole. It was a private crime. Mass violation of the human rights in the area of Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda made the United Nations to begin with prosecuting and punishing such treatment. Rape and other forms of sexual violence was recognized as a war crime and the crime against humanity {{on the basis of the}} judgements of <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts.</b> Rape can, under certain circumstances, fulfill the fact of the case of genocide. <b>The</b> <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> strongly made [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{agreement}} and subsequent ceasefire, relations between Kagame and the Congolese government have remained tense. A 2003 United Nations report alleged that Rwanda was using demobilised soldiers {{to continue its}} illegal exploitation of Congolese minerals. Meanwhile, Kagame blamed Kabila for failing to suppress Hutu rebels in North and South Kivu provinces. Two major insurgencies {{have occurred in the}} eastern provinces: the first, from 2005 to 2009, was led by Congolese Tutsi Laurent Nkunda, while the second, carried out by the March 23 Movement (M23) under leader Bosco Ntaganda, began in 2012; Ntaganda gave himself up to <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Criminal</b> <b>Court</b> in early 2013, and peace talks have taken place, but as of May 2013 the conflict is at risk of resuming. Human Rights Watch alleges that both insurgencies were supported by Rwanda, a charge Kagame denies. A leaked United Nations report in 2012 also alleges Rwandan support for M23; this report cites Kagame's defence minister James Kabarebe as being effectively the commander of the movement.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December 2010, a {{week after}} the ICC Prosecutor {{announced}} the individuals he was seeking to prosecute, the Kenyan National Assembly passed a motion seeking to withdraw Kenya as a State Party to the Rome Statute, the treaty which established <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Criminal</b> <b>Court.</b> The motion, which was introduced by Assembly Member Isaac Ruto had previously been thrown out of the National Assembly by Deputy Speaker Farah Maalim who ruled it was unconstitutional; however an amended version was introduced the following day and passed. During the debate, the Minister for Energy Kiraitu Murungi claimed the ICC was a colonialist, imperialist court. This motion did not itself affect Kenya's status as a State Party to the Rome Statute, but rather obliges ministers to move to repeal Kenya's International Crimes Act which ratified the Rome Statute and made necessarily changes to Kenyan's criminal code. In February 2011, Kenya appealed to the United Nations Security Council, asking it to defer the trials at The Hague. Some critics in Kenya have also questioned the constitutionality of the Rome Statute, arguing that it is incompatible with the Constitution of Kenya, which was passed by a referendum in 2010.|$|E
