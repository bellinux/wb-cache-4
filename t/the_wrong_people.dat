60|$|There {{was also}} another common mistake into which Messrs. Bragg and Dodge had {{permitted}} themselves to fall, through the {{want of a}} proper distinction between principles.

25|$|Chapter 3: The Double Shakedown - in this chapter, Finkelstein {{claims that}} the number of Jewish {{survivors}} of the Holocaust recognized by relief groups increased from c. 100,000 in 1945 to nearly 1 million owing to definitional changes in who was considered to be a survivor. Because of this, Finkelstein repeatedly asserts that fraudulent claims were made on Switzerland, while accounts and assets in the US and Israel were ignored. Payments were made to <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>people</b> and real survivors lost out.|$|E

50|$|Cryptomnesia is a source-monitoring {{error in}} which people often have {{difficulty}} determining whether a concept was internally generated or experienced externally.

Some individuals fail to establish memories with enough detail to generate a source attribution, causing a misattribution of memory to <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> source. <b>People</b> often truly believe that the information they plagiarized was actually that of their own.|$|R
25|$|In {{part the}} Treaty {{was an attempt}} to {{establish}} a system of property rights for land with the Crown controlling and overseeing land sale to prevent abuse and initially this worked well and the Governor had the sole right to buy and sell land from the Māori. Māori were eager to sell land, and settlers eager to buy. The Crown was supposed to mediate the process to ensure that the true owners were properly identified (difficult for tribally owned land) and fairly compensated, {{by the standards of the}} time. In particular, the Governor had the responsibility to protect Māori interests. Governor Grey set out to buy large tracts of Māori land in advance of settlement at low prices, later selling it to settlers at higher prices and using the difference to develop land access (roads and bridges). Donald McLean acted as Grey's intermediary and negotiator, and as early as 1840 was aware that Māori had no concept of the sale of land in British sense. Soon Māori became disillusioned and less willing to sell, while the Crown came under increasing pressure from settlers wishing to buy. Consequently, government land agents were involved in a number of dubious land purchases, agreements were sometimes negotiated with only one owner of tribally owned land and in some cases land was purchased from <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>people</b> altogether. Eventually this led to the New Zealand Wars which culminated in the confiscation of a large part of the Waikato and Taranaki.|$|E
500|$|In 1919, aged sixteen, Richardson took a post as office {{boy with}} the Brighton branch of the Liverpool and Victoria {{insurance}} company. The pay, ten shillings a week, was attractive, but office life was not; he lacked concentration, frequently posting documents to <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>people</b> as well as engaging in pranks that alarmed his superiors. [...] His paternal grandmother died and left him £500, which, he later said, transformed his life. He resigned from the office post, {{just in time to}} avoid being dismissed, and enrolled at the Brighton School of Art.

500|$|The lead-up to Adore {{was marked}} by {{conflicting}} statements as to the album's sound—Corgan initially said the band was heading {{in the direction of}} the heavy-metal-guitar-and-electronic music-driven [...] "The End is the Beginning is the End" [...] in summer 1997. while the band's management reported the album would be all-acoustic. In early 1998, Corgan called the sound [...] "arcane night music", elaborating, [...] "The people that say it's acoustic will be <b>wrong.</b> <b>The</b> <b>people</b> that say it's electronic will be <b>wrong.</b> <b>The</b> <b>people</b> that say it's a Pumpkins record will be wrong. I will try to make something that is indescribable". Further complicating the situation was the record label's initial insistence to use the Rick Rubin produced, upbeat, poppy song [...] "Let Me Give the World to You" [...] as the album's lead single, something Corgan strongly objected to, fearing it would give listeners <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> first impression of the album. Corgan had to drop the song off the track list altogether to avoid using it as a single.|$|R

2500|$|Following the {{introduction}} of internment in 1971, [...] "Operation Demetrius" [...] was implemented by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and British Army with raids for 452 suspects on 9 August 1971. The RUC and army arrested 342 Irish nationalists, but key Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) members had been tipped off and 104 of those arrested were released when it emerged they had no paramilitary connections. Those behind Operation Demetrius were accused of bungling, by arresting many of <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>people</b> and using out-of-date information. Following nationalist protests, some Ulster loyalists were also arrested. By 1972, there were 924 internees {{and by the end}} of internment on 5 December 1975, 1,981 people had been detained; 1,874 (94.6%) of whom were Catholic/Irish nationalist and 107 (5.4%) Ulster Protestants/loyalists.|$|E

2500|$|In July 1960, Rivers {{suffered}} from a stroke which left him paralysed down his right side. [...] Amber was distraught and during {{the last years of}} his life she worried a lot and became depressed. She wrote to her daughter Anna-Jane, who was in Singapore at the time, [...] "If there is a Confucian temple in K.L., you might make a little offering (if he does like offerings).....I have more faith in him now than in our own deity who seems to be letting us down all round". When Rivers died on 28 March 1966, Amber was determined to keep living as normally as possible. She was visited by New Zealand historian Keith Sinclair who was writing a biography of her father, and twice by interviewers from the BBC. Although she enjoyed discussing politics and world affairs, she felt disillusioned about the socialist hopes of her youth, and supported the Conservatives in the 1970 election. She believed that <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>people</b> were leading the left and that only diehards would vote for them.|$|E
2500|$|The game's {{story begins}} with an attack by a heavily armed force on the dojo of the Hisomu ninja clan. The unnamed ninja protagonist, resting after {{receiving}} an extensive irezumi tattoo, is awakened by a female ninja named Ora. Gathering his equipment, the protagonist is able to defeat the attackers and rescue his sensei, Azai, {{as well as several}} other members of the clan. Before being rescued by the protagonist, Azai was being blamed by the attackers, who said [...] "you picked <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>people</b> to steal from". However, Azai simply claimed that the clan has been hidden from the modern world for centuries until now, when [...] "their enemies finally found them". Azai tells him about the power of his tattoo and the legend surrounding it, explaining that the ink comes from a special desert flower and grants greatly sharpened senses and reflexes when absorbed slowly into the body, but will ultimately cause one so tattooed with it to descend into madness. In the distant past, the first Hisomu ninja to receive the Mark became incredibly dangerous, but increasingly deranged, leading to a lengthy reign of terror that only ended with his demise. Therefore, to receive the Mark, a ninja swears to commit seppuku once the madness begins to take hold.|$|E

On 9 September 1965, Norse Commander caught fire whilst under repair in a drydock at the Albert Dock, Tanjong Pagar, Singapore. The fire was quickly extinguished and little damage was done. A reporter and cameraman from The Straits Times were refused access to the dock by the Singapore Port Authority, which claimed that the reporter [...] "might interfere with the firefighting operation, speak to <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>people</b> and write the wrong report". The port authority later handed out an official press release. The Straits Times commented in an editorial that the ban of its reporter was [...] "censorship of the very worst kind, bureaucracy in its stupidest mood". In 1966, Norse Commander suffered boiler defects. She arrived under tow at Singapore on 6 September. Repairs were deemed to be uneconomic, and she was sold to the Hong Huat Hardware Co, Singapore for scrapping. She arrived at their yard on 12 November 1966.|$|E

2500|$|There are differing {{explanations}} for the apparent collapse of the police force in Mosul.

He wrote for The New York Review of Books that [...] "Petraeus ignored warnings from America's Kurdish allies that he was appointing <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>people</b> to key positions in Mosul's local government and police." [...] On the other hand, in the book Fiasco, The Washington Post reporter Tom Ricks wrote that [...] "Mosul was quiet while he (Petraeus) was there, and likely would have remained so had his successor had as many troops as he had—and as much understanding of counterinsurgency techniques." [...] Ricks {{went on to say}} that [...] "the population-oriented approach Petraeus took in Mosul in 2003 would be the one the entire U.S. Army in Iraq was trying to adopt in 2006." [...] Time columnist Joe Klein largely agreed with Ricks, writing that the Stryker brigade that replaced the 101st [...] "didn't do any of the local governance that Petraeus had done". Moving away from counterinsurgency principles, [...] "they were occupiers, not builders." [...] The New York Times reporter Michael Gordon and retired General Bernard Trainor echoed Ricks and Klein, including in their book Cobra II a quote that Petraeus [...] "did it right and won over Mosul".|$|E
