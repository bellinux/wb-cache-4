5|$|Nixon {{was one of}} the few leading Republicans not {{blamed for}} the {{disastrous}} results, and he sought to build on that in the 1966 congressional elections. He campaigned for many Republicans seeking to regain seats lost in the Johnson landslide and received credit for helping the Republicans make major gains in <b>the</b> <b>midterm</b> election.|$|E
5|$|Ohio statewide {{offices are}} {{regularly}} contested {{every four years}} in <b>the</b> <b>midterm</b> election years. 2008 is Class 2 senatorial election year, and Ohio is a state with class 1 and class 3 senators. Thus, the Attorney General race was the only non-presidential race in the 2008 election aside from contests for two seats on the Ohio Supreme Court. Cordray defeated Republican Mike Crites, 57%-38%.|$|E
5|$|The Infantry Fighting Vehicle {{superseded}} {{the previous}} infantry carrier replacement effort, the XM1206 Infantry Carrier Vehicle of the FCS MGV program. It was the U.S. Army's intention that the IFV replace the M113 APC by 2018, the M2 Bradley later, and the Stryker ICV in <b>the</b> <b>midterm.</b> The IFV was {{to hold a}} crew of three and a squad of nine.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> 2010 <b>midterm</b> {{election}} is also <b>the</b> third consecutive <b>midterm</b> election {{held in a}} president's first term where Republicans picked up seats across both houses of Congress.

5000|$|As {{an ally of}} Nancy Pelosi, Israel was {{mentioned}} in 2010 as a possible successor to Chris Van Hollen, {{the chairman of the}} DCCC; he declined to speak about it until after <b>the</b> <b>midterms</b> were over, saying he was [...] "just completely focused on supporting Nancy Pelosi." ...|$|R
5|$|The Army {{was using}} an {{incremental}} approach to combat vehicle modernization, {{centered on the}} Ground Combat Vehicle. The deployment was to be synchronized with upgrades, reset, and divestiture of existing vehicles. Vehicles displaced by the IFV may then replace selected M113 family of vehicles such as command and control, medical evacuation, and mortar carrier, allowing the Army to begin divestiture of the M113 family of vehicles. Upgrades to existing Bradley and Stryker vehicles may have been considered as risk mitigation based on {{the rate at which}} the GCV was introduced. Although upgraded, the Bradley and Stryker would also be replaced in <b>the</b> <b>midterm.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>midterm</b> congressional {{elections}} of 1854 and 1855 were devastating to the Democrats (as {{well as to}} the Whig Party, which was on its last legs). The Democrats lost almost every state outside the South. The administration's opponents in the North worked together to return opposition members to Congress, though only a few northern Whigs gained election. In Pierce's New Hampshire, hitherto loyal to the Democratic Party, the Know-Nothings elected the governor, all three representatives, dominated the legislature, and returned John P. Hale to the Senate. Anti-immigrant fervor brought the Know-Nothings their highest numbers to that point, and some northerners were elected {{under the auspices of the}} new Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Nixon {{took office in}} 1969, {{inflation}} was at 4.7percent—its highest rate since the Korean War. The Great Society had been enacted under Johnson, which, together with the Vietnam War costs, was causing large budget deficits. Unemployment was low, but interest rates were at their highest in a century. Nixon's major economic goal was to reduce inflation; the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war. This could not be accomplished overnight, and the U.S. economy continued to struggle through 1970, contributing to a lackluster Republican performance in <b>the</b> <b>midterm</b> congressional elections (Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon's presidency). According to political economist Nigel Bowles in his 2011 study of Nixon's economic record, the new president did little to alter Johnson's policies through {{the first year of}} his presidency.|$|E

5|$|He {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with Djurgården in May 2008. The club's initial plan for Josefson {{was to move}} {{him up to the}} senior team when regular players were out of the lineup with illness or injuries, while his usual team would be the J20-team. He scored his first goal in Elitserien on 23 September in his third game, a 4–1 win against Brynäs IF. Ultimately, Josefson played almost every game of the regular season, and usually played along with Carl Gustafsson and Henrik Eriksson on the 4th line. At the end of the season, Josefson had scored 5 goals and 16 points, a record for players 18 or younger playing with the senior team. Josefson was ranked third in <b>the</b> <b>midterm</b> rankings among European skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau for the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. He was selected {{in the first round of}} the 2009 NHL draft by the New Jersey Devils, 20th overall. Josefson was also drafted in the third round, 61st overall, in the 2009 KHL Junior Draft by SKA Saint Petersburg. He participated at the Devils rookie camp in July 2009. He has been compared with centres Nicklas Bäckström and John Madden.|$|E
25|$|The Infantry Fighting Vehicle variant was {{intended}} to fill the infantry transport role in Heavy Brigade Combat Teams replacing the aging M113 APC, M2 Bradley, and M1126 Infantry Carrier Vehicle.

25|$|With Vice President Dick Cheney {{choosing}} not to {{seek the}} nomination and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ruling herself out, {{the race for the}} 2008 presidential nomination was wide open. It officially began in March 2006 when John H. Cox became the first candidate to enter the 2008 race. The Democratic takeover of both houses of Congress and President Bush's unpopularity were strong issues for the GOP field. At the beginning of 2007, the announced Republican field was former Governor of Wisconsin and Cabinet member Tommy Thompson, former Governor of Virginia Jim Gilmore, and Senator of Kansas Sam Brownback. Former senator of Virginia George Allen was considered a top contender until his loss in <b>the</b> <b>midterm</b> elections. He announced on December 10, 2006 that he would not seek the 2008 nomination. In early January former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney announced he was forming an exploratory committee. Afterwards several others announced they were running, including U.S.Congressman Ron Paul, Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, Rudy Giuliani of New York City, U.S. Senator John McCain, U.S. Congressman Duncan Hunter, and U.S. Congressman Tom Tancredo. A poll released in early February had Giuliani leading with 32% and John McCain second with 18%. By early March, Giuliani had become the frontrunner. Alan Keyes and former Senator and actor Fred Thompson entered the race later in September.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} when Nixon took office in January 1969, {{inflation}} was at 4.7%, its highest rate since the Korean War, and rising. The Great Society had been enacted under Johnson, which, together with the Vietnam War costs, was causing large budget deficits. There was little unemployment (3.3%,), but interest rates were at their highest in a century. Nixon's major economic goal was to reduce inflation; the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war. That however could not be accomplished overnight. The administration adopted a policy of restricting {{the growth of the}} money supply to address the inflation problem. In February 1970, {{as a part of the}} effort to keep federal spending down, Nixon delayed pay raises to federal employees by six months. When the nation's postal workers went on strike, he used the Army to keep the postal system going. In the end, the government met the postal workers' wage demands, undoing some of the desired budget-balancing. According to political economist Nigel Bowles's 2011 study of Nixon's economic policies, the new president did little to alter Johnson's policies through the first year of his presidency. The president and congressional Republicans entered the 1970 campaign season faced with unemployment, inflation, and Democratic demands for an incomes policy, all of which contributed to a lackluster Republican performance in <b>the</b> <b>midterm</b> congressional elections (Republicans gained two seats in the Senate but lost nine in the House; Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon's presidency).|$|E
500|$|Rice's district, which {{contained}} more registered Republicans than Democrats, {{was one of}} those targeted by Colorado Republicans hoping to make gains during <b>the</b> <b>midterm</b> 2010 legislative elections. [...] Rice narrowly lost re-election in 2010 to Kathleen Conti, losing 51% to 49% (892 votes out of 30,510 votes cast) in a district where Republicans outnumber Democrats by almost 10 points in voter registration.|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of August 14, 1906, gunshots were heard in the border town of Brownsville, Texas; one {{resident}} was killed and a police officer wounded. [...] Various military items, including discharged rifle shells, were presented by the local mayor as evidence that troops of the [...] 25th Infantry Battalion, stationed outside of town and consisting of blacks, were responsible. [...] When questioned, all denied involvement. [...] Nevertheless, their white officers reported to the War Department that undetermined men belonging to the 25th Infantry were responsible, and that others of the battalion were aware of who had done it, but were remaining silent. [...] Despite an almost total lack of evidence, on November 5, 1906 (just after <b>the</b> <b>midterm</b> congressional elections), Roosevelt ordered 167 soldiers dishonorably discharged and made ineligible for federal employment, including such decorated soldiers as First Sergeant Mingo Sanders, who had fought alongside Roosevelt in Cuba.

In a story concerning the draft's [...] "conciliatory language" [...] on controversial social issues, Voris, whom NPR described as representative of [...] "many reporters ... stunned by the welcoming tone and language" [...] towards homosexuals, was quoted as asking with regard to paragraph 52, which claimed homosexuals have [...] "gifts and qualities" [...] to offer to the Church: [...] "Is the Synod proposing that there is something innate in the homosexual orientation that transcends and uplifts the Catholic Church?" [...] Cardinal Bruno Forte, who himself had included the controversial paragraph in <b>the</b> <b>Midterm</b> Relatio, smiled and replied, [...] "It is not easy to answer such an ontological question.

2500|$|Archbishop Zbigņevs Stankevičs echoed Gądecki, {{saying that}} to face the strong ideological attack waged today against the family, the synod must apply the Church's {{teaching}} afresh to the situation, but not by [...] "losing our Catholic identity and without renouncing the truth about marriage." [...] <b>The</b> <b>midterm</b> report left people with many questions, said Archbishop Joseph Edward Kurtz, who added [...] "we didn't {{want to leave the}} synod with that lack of clarity."

2500|$|Newfound {{goes off}} of the Summative {{assessment}} and Formative assessment continuum. Most of the teachers weigh the summatives as 90% of the overall grade for the quarter and 10% formatives for the overall grade for the quarter.
