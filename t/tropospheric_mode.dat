40|$|Coupling {{of local}} {{chemical}} processes {{over the globe}} by atmospheric transport leads {{to the existence of}} chemical modes that are a fundamental characterization of global atmospheric chemistry and provide a true description of the atmospheric response to small changes in trace-gas emissions. Such coupled chemistry-transport modes in global tropospheric chemistry are an inherent feature of three-dimensional chemical transport models (CTMs). In CTMs these modes cannot be solved for explicitly, as they have been for the case of low-order, fully linearized systems, but they are investigated here through a series of perturbation experiments. When using meteorological fields that recycle every year, the long-lived modes are readily seen as seasonal decay patterns that e-fold each year. An important application of chemical modes is the study of how emissions of CO and NO excite perturbations to the CH 4 -like mode, the longest-lived (primary) mode found in tropospheric chemistry (i,e., with fixed stratospheric composition). Perturbation experiments are conducted with the University of California, Irvine, three-dimensional tropospheric CTM to identify this primary <b>tropospheric</b> <b>mode</b> and to determine its five-dimensional structure. The previous demonstrations of a long-lived chemical mode with 1. 5 times the lifetime of CH 4 are corroborated. The ability of emissions of CO and NO to excite this mode is then demonstrated, and a quantitative evaluation of the indirect effect of CO emissions on the greenhouse gases CH 4 and tropospheric O- 3 is made, showing that 100 kg of CO is equivalent to 5 - 6 kg of CH 4 emissions...|$|E
40|$|An {{effective}} {{boundary condition}} is derived {{for the top}} of the troposphere, based on a wave radiation condition at the tropopause. This boundary condition, which can be formulated as a pseudodifferential equation, leads to new vertical dissipative modes. These modes can be computed explicitly in the classical setup of a hydrostatic, nonrotating atmosphere with a piecewise constant Brunt–Vaisala frequency. In the limit of an infinitely strongly stratified stratosphere, these modes lose their dissipative nature and become the regular baroclinic <b>tropospheric</b> <b>modes</b> under the rigid-lid approximation. For realistic values of the stratification, the decay time scales of the first few modes for mesoscale disturbances range from an hour to a week, suggesting that the time scale for some atmospheric phenomena may be set up by the rate of energy loss through upward-propagating waves.

40|$|Using reanalysed {{atmospheric}} {{data and}} applying a data-driven multiscale approximation to nonstationary dynamical processes, we undertake a systematic {{examination of the}} role of memory and dimensionality in dening the quasi-stationary states of the troposphere over the recent decades. We focus on the role of teleconnections characterised by either zonally-oriented wave trains or meridional dipolar structures. We consider the impact of various strategies for dimension reduction based on principal component analysis, diagonalization and truncation. We include the impact of memory by consideration of Bernoulli, Markovian and non-Markovian processes. We a priori explicitly separate barotropic and baroclinic processes and then implement a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to the number and type of retained modes. Our results show the importance of explicitly mitigating the deleterious impacts of signal degradation through ill-conditioning and under sampling in preference to simple strategies based on thresholds in terms of explained variance. In both hemispheres, the results obtained for the dominant <b>tropospheric</b> <b>modes</b> depend critically {{on the extent to which}} the higher order modes are retained, the number of free model parameters to be tted, and whether memory eects are taken into account. Our study identies the primary role of the circumglobal teleconnection pattern in both hemispheres for Bernoulli and Markov processes, and the transient nature and zonal structure of the Southern Hemisphere patterns in relation to their Northern Hemisphere counterparts. For both hemispheres, overtted models yield structures consistent with the major teleconnection modes (NAO, PNA and SAM), which give way to zonally oriented wavetrains when either memory eects are ignored or where the dimension is reduced via diagonalising. Where baroclinic processes are emphasised, circumpolar wavetrains are manifest...|$|R

General comment It is criticized that we leave open what the basis was for chosing the size distribu-tion of particles used in the simulations. The mean lognormal mode radius (0. 1 µm) and width (1. 5) are chosen such {{that most of the}} freezing particles are in the accu-mulation mode size range. This choice takes into account that atmospheric particles which have been chemically analyzed (e. g., with the PALMS instrument) are 0. 1 – 1 µm in size. Much larger liquid particles do hardly exist in notable concentrations in the S 3464 upper troposphere, while an aged accumulation mode is always present prior to cirrus cloud formation (e. g., Schröder et al., 2000). Smaller Aitken mode particles only have a chance to freeze homogeneously when this reservoir of larger particles is depleted. We are taking a lower limit concentration of free and upper <b>tropospheric</b> accumulation <b>mode</b> particles (typically several 100 cm− 3), but observe in our calculations that crys...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} stratospheric {{variability}} on the dynamical coupling between the stratosphere and the tro-posphere is explored {{in a relatively}} simple atmospheric general circulation model. Variability of the model’s stratospheric polar vortex, or polar night jet, is induced by topographically forced stationary waves. A robust relationship is found between {{the strength of the}} stratospheric polar vortex and the latitude of the tropo-spheric jet, confirming and extending earlier results in the absence of stationary waves. In both the clima-tological mean and on intraseasonal time scales, a weaker vortex is associated with an equatorward shift in the tropospheric jet and vice versa. It is found that the mean structure and variability of the vortex in the model is very sensitive to the amplitude of the topography and that Northern Hemisphere–like variability, with a realistic frequency of stratospheric sudden warming events, occurs only for a relatively narrow range of topographic heights. When the model captures sudden warming events with fidelity, however, the exchange of information both upward and downward between the troposphere and stratosphere closely resembles that in observations. The in-fluence of stratospheric variability on variability in the troposphere is demonstrated by comparing integra-tions with and without an active stratosphere. A realistic, time-dependent stratospheric circulation increases the persistence of the <b>tropospheric</b> annular <b>modes,</b> and the dynamical coupling is most apparent prior to and following stratospheric sudden warming events. 1...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{temperature}} {{is one of}} the most important climate variables. This observational study presents detailed descriptions of the temperature variability imprinted in the 9 -year brightness temperature data acquired by the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-Instrument A (AMSU-A) aboard Aqua since September 2002 over tropical oceans. A non-linear, adaptive method called the Ensemble Joint Multiple Extraction has been employed to extract the principal modes of variability in the AMSU-A/Aqua data. The semi-annual, annual, quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) modes and QBO–annual beat in the troposphere and the stratosphere have been successfully recovered. The modulation by the El Niño/Southern oscillation (ENSO) in the troposphere was found and correlates well with the Multivariate ENSO Index. The long-term variations during 2002 – 2011 reveal a cooling trend (− 0. 5 K/decade at 10 hPa) in the tropical stratosphere; the trend below the tropical tropopause is not statistically significant due to the length of our data. A new <b>tropospheric</b> near-annual <b>mode</b> (period ~ 1. 6 years) was also revealed in the troposphere, whose existence was confirmed using National Centers for Environmental Prediction Reanalysis air temperature data. The near-annual mode in the troposphere is found to prevail in the eastern Pacific region and is coherent with a near-annual mode in the observed sea surface temperature over the Warm Pool region that has previously been reported. It remains a challenge for climate models to simulate the trends and principal modes of natural variability reported in this work...|$|R
40|$|The {{coupling}} {{between the}} stratosphere and the troposphere following two major stratospheric sudden warmings is {{studied in the}} Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model using a nudging technique by which the zonal-mean evolution of the reference sudden warmings are artificially induced in an ~ 100 -member ensemble spun off from a control simulation. Both reference warmings are taken from a freely running integration of the model. One event is a displacement, {{the other is a}} split, and both are followed by extended recoveries in the lower stratosphere. The methodology permits a statistically robust study of their influence on the troposphere below. The nudged ensembles exhibit a <b>tropospheric</b> annular <b>mode</b> response closely analogous to that seen in observations, confirming the downward influence of sudden warmings on the troposphere in a comprehensive model. This tropospheric response coincides more closely with the lower-stratospheric annular mode anomalies than with the midstratospheric wind reversal. In addition to the expected synoptic-scale eddy feedback, the planetary-scale eddies also reinforce the tropospheric wind changes, apparently responding directly to the stratospheric anomalies. Furthermore, despite the zonal symmetry of the stratospheric perturbation, a highly zonally asymmetric near-surface response is produced, corresponding to a strongly negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation with a much weaker response over the Pacific basin that matches composites of sudden warmings from the Interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim). Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models exhibit a similar response, though in most models the response’s magnitude is underrepresented...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the possible linkage between the recent reduction in Arctic sea-ice extent and the wintertime Arctic Oscillation (AO) /North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Observational analyses using the ERA interim reanalysis and merged Hadley/Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature data reveal that a reduced (increased) sea-ice area in November {{leads to more}} negative (positive) phases of the AO and NAO in early and late winter, respectively. We simulate the atmospheric response to observed sea-ice anomalies using a high-top atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM for Earth Simulator, AFES version 4. 1). The results from the simulation reveal that the recent Arctic sea-ice reduction results in cold winters in mid-latitude continental regions, which are linked to an anomalous circulation pattern similar to the negative phase of AO/NAO with an increased frequency of large negative AO events {{by a factor of}} over two. Associated with this negative AO/NAO phase, cold air advection from the Arctic to the mid-latitudes increases. We found that the stationary Rossby wave response to the sea-ice reduction in the Barents Sea region induces this anomalous circulation. We also found a positive feedback mechanism resulting from the anomalous meridional circulation that cools the mid-latitudes and warms the Arctic, which adds an extra heating to the Arctic air column equivalent to about 60 % of the direct surface heat release from the sea-ice reduction. The results from this high-top model experiment also suggested a critical role of the stratosphere in deepening the <b>tropospheric</b> annular <b>mode</b> and modulation of the NAO in mid to late winter through stratosphere-troposphere coupling...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe role of {{convection}} {{in introducing}} aerosols and promoting {{the formation of}} new particles to the upper troposphere has been examined using a cloud-resolving model coupled with an interactive explicit aerosol module. A baseline simulation suggests good agreement in the upper troposphere between modeled and observed results including concentrations of aerosols in different size ranges, mole fractions of key chemical species, and concentrations of ice particles. In addition, a set of 34 sensitivity simulations {{has been carried out}} to investigate the sensitivity of modeled results to the treatment of various aerosol physical and chemical processes in the model. The size distribution of aerosols is proved to be an important factor in determining the aerosols' fate within the convective cloud. Nucleation mode aerosols (0 2 SO 4. Accumulation mode aerosols (d>? 31. 0 nm) are almost completely removed by nucleation (activation of cloud droplets) and impact scavenging. However, a substantial part (up to 10 % of the boundary layer concentration) of the Aitken mode aerosol population (5. 84 nm<?d<? 31. 0 nm) reaches the top of the cloud and the free troposphere. These particles may continually survive in the upper troposphere, or over time form ice crystals, both that could impact the atmospheric radiative budget. The sensitivity simulations performed indicate that critical processes in the model causing a substantial change in the upper <b>tropospheric</b> Aitken <b>mode</b> number concentration are coagulation, condensation, nucleation scavenging, nucleation of aerosols and the transfer of aerosol mass and number between different aerosol bins. In particular, for aerosols in the Aitken mode to grow to CCN size, coagulation appears to be more important than condensation. Less important processes are dry deposition, impact scavenging and the initial vertical distribution and concentration of aerosols. It {{is interesting to note that}} in order to sustain a vigorous storm cloud, the supply of CCN must be continuous over a considerably long time period of the simulation. Hence, the treatment of the growth of particles is in general much more important than the initial aerosol concentration itself...|$|R

A set of 50 years long simulations by atmospheric general circulation model European Centre/Hamburg version 5 (ECHAM 5) is carried out and the responses of the model to observed anomalies in stratospheric ozone (O 3) and sea surface temperatures (SST) separately and also the response to combined SST and O 3 forcing (ALL) are analyzed. In all three experiments the response is characterized by a strengthening of stratospheric polar vortex in March-April. In the ALL experiment, this strengthening is followed by a significant, long-lasting shift of the tropospheric circulation toward a positive NAM phase and increased probability of occurrence of extremely positive NAM events. The combined effect of the O 3 and SST forcings on the stratospheric circulation differs from the sum of the individual O 3 and SST responses, most likely due to nonlinear effects, leading to a colder stratosphere in February-March. In the troposphere, the sum of the individual responses is comparable in magnitude to the ALL response, but the individual responses are delayed with respect to that in ALL. In summary, these results suggest that both ozone-induced stratospheric cooling and tropospheric forcing associated with the SST anomalies contributed to the record tropospheric climate anomalies observed in spring 2011...|$|R
40|$|A common bias among {{global climate}} models (GCMs) {{is that they}} exhibit <b>tropospheric</b> {{southern}} annular <b>mode</b> (SAM) variability that is much too persistent in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) summertime. This is {{of concern for the}} ability to accurately predict future SH circulation changes, so it is important that it be understood and alleviated. In this two-part study, specifically targeted experiments with the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM) are used to improve understanding of the enhanced summertime SAM persistence. Given the ubiquity of this bias among comprehensive GCMs, {{it is likely that the}} results will be relevant for other climate models. Here, in Part I, the influence of climatological circulation biases on SAM variability is assessed, with a particular focus on two common biases that could enhance summertime SAM persistence: the too-late breakdown of the Antarctic stratospheric vortex and the equatorward bias in the SH tropospheric midlatitude jet. Four simulations are used to investigate the role of each of these biases in CMAM. Nudging and bias correcting procedures are used to systematically remove zonal-mean stratospheric variability and/or remove climatological zonal wind biases. The SAM time-scale bias is not alleviated by improving either the timing of the stratospheric vortex breakdown or the climatological jet structure. Even in the absence of stratospheric variability and with an improved climatological circulation, the model time scales are biased long. This points toward a bias in internal tropospheric dynamics that is not caused by the tropospheric jet structure bias. The underlying cause of this is examined in more detail in Part II of this study...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{identified}} {{an association between}} near-surface temperature anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere and weak stratospheric polar westerlies. Large regions in northern Asia, Europe and North America {{have been found to}} cool in the mature and late stages of stratospheric weak vortex events. A substantial part of the temperature changes are associated with changes to the <b>tropospheric</b> Northern Annular <b>Mode</b> and North Atlantic Oscillation pressure patterns. The apparent coupling between the stratosphere and the troposphere may be of relevance for weather forecasting, but only if the temporal and spatial nature of the coupling is known. Here we show, using 51 winters of re-analysis data, that the tropospheric temperature development relative to stratospheric weak polar vortex events goes through a series of well-defined stages, including geographically distinct cold air outbreaks. At the inception of weak vortex events, a precursor signal {{in the form of a}} strong high-pressure anomaly is found over Northwest Europe. At the same time, long-lived and robust cold anomalies appear over Asia and Western Europe. A few weeks later, near the mature stage of weak vortex events, a shorter-lived cold anomaly emerges off the east coast of North America. The probability of cold air outbreaks in different phases of the weak vortex life cycle increases by 40 - 70 % in four key regions. This shows that the stratospheric polar vortex contains information that can be used to enhance forecasts of cold air outbreaks. 300 -year pre-industrial control runs of 11 state-of-the-art coupled climate models corroborate our results.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{various aspects}} of the {{variability}} of the stratospheric polar vortex and the effect of this variability on tropospheric weather and climate patterns on various timescales. In {{the first part of this}} work, an improved idealized model was developed to study the coupled stratosphere-troposphere system. The model is forced by relaxation to a specified equilibrium temperature profile, which varies seasonally only in the stratosphere. This model setup permits the investigation of stratosphere-troposphere interactions on seasonal timescales, without the complication of an internal tropospheric seasonal cycle. The model is forced with different shapes and amplitudes of simple bottom topography, resulting in a range of stratospheric climates. The effect of these different kinds of topography on the seasonal variability of the strength of the polar vortex, the average timing and variability in timing of the final breakup of the vortex (final warming events), the conditions of occurrence and frequency of midwinter warming events, and the impact of the stratospheric seasonal cycle on the troposphere are explored. The inclusion of wavenumber 1 and wavenumber 2 topographies results in very different stratospheric seasonal variability. Hemispheric differences in stratospheric seasonal variability are recovered in the model with appropriate choices of wave- 2 topography. In the model experiment with a realistic Northern Hemisphere-like frequency of midwinter warming events, the distribution of the intervals between these events suggest that the model has no year to year memory. When forced with wave- 1 topography, the gross features of seasonal variability are similar to those forced with wave- 2 topography, but the dependence on forcing magnitude is weaker. Further, the frequency of major warming events has a non-monotonic dependence on forcing magnitude, and never reaches the frequency observed in the northern hemisphere. In the second part of the thesis, the impact of stratospheric ozone depletion on the Antarctic polar vortex and its subsequent influences on southern hemisphere surface climate patterns is investigated. It is verified that stratospheric final warming events have an impact on tropospheric circulation in a simplified GCM with seasonal variations in the stratosphere only. The model produces qualitatively realistic final warming events whose influence extends down to the surface, much like what has been reported in observational analyses. The hypothesis that recent observed trends in surface westerlies in the Southern Hemisphere are directly consequent on observed trends in the timing of stratospheric final warming events is tested. It is confirmed that there is a statistically significant shift towards later final warming events in the years with large ozone depletion. However it is found that the observed trends in surface westerlies cannot be attributed simply to this shift towards later final warming events. Finally, responses of the idealized AGCM to polar stratospheric cooling that mimics the radiative effects of stratospheric ozone depletion are studied. It is found that there are two factors that play a role in setting the magnitude and persistence of the model's surface response to cooling: the seasonal cycle of <b>tropospheric</b> annular <b>mode</b> timescales, and whether or not the imposed cooling leads to the presence of stratospheric westerlies at a time when easterlies were prevalent in the control run. That is, the surface response is sensitive to the timing of the imposed polar stratospheric cooling. by Aditi Sheshadri. Thesis: Ph.
