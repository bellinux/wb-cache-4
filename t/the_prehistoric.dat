5|$|Regularly {{travelling}} to London {{to visit}} friends, one notable comrade was Stuart Piggott, another influential British archaeologist who succeeded Childe as Abercromby Professor at Edinburgh. Another was Grahame Clark, whom Childe befriended and encouraged in his research. The trio were elected onto the committee of <b>the</b> <b>Prehistoric</b> Society of East Anglia. At Clark's suggestion, in 1935 they used their influence {{to convert it}} into a nationwide organisation, <b>the</b> <b>Prehistoric</b> Society, of which Childe was elected president. Membership of the group then grew rapidly; in 1935 it had 353 members, and this had increased to 668 in 1938.|$|E

Along {{the length of the}} eastern coast runs a narrow and steep escarpment containing much of the island's remaining tropical lowland forest.|$|E

5|$|All modern scleractinian skeletons are {{composed}} of calcium carbonate {{in the form of}} crystals of aragonite, however, a prehistoric scleractinian (Coelosimilia) had a non-aragonite skeletal structure which was composed of calcite. The structure of both simple and compound scleractinians is light and porous, rather than solid {{as is the case in}} <b>the</b> <b>prehistoric</b> order Rugosa. Scleractinians are also distinguished from rugosans by their pattern of septal insertion.|$|E
5|$|If {{used as a}} {{space for}} rituals, the Hampton Down circle would have only been able to {{accommodate}} a few individuals standing within it at any given time. It was also not the site of any cremation deposits, unlike some stone circles in Northern Britain. Burl suggested that the Hampton Down Stone Circle may never {{have been part of}} <b>the</b> <b>prehistoric</b> stone circle tradition, but that the stones were actually once the kerbstones of a round barrow. To support this suggestion, he noted that round barrows were known at Poole, around 20 miles (32 kilometres) to the east of the site.|$|E
5|$|In Denmark, {{the monarchy}} {{goes back to}} <b>the</b> <b>prehistoric</b> times of the legendary kings, before the 10th century. Currently, about 80 per cent support keeping the monarchy.

5|$|Manitoba is at {{the centre}} of the Hudson Bay {{drainage}} basin, with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. This basin's rivers reach far west to the mountains, far south into the United States, and east into Ontario. Major watercourses include the Red, Assiniboine, Nelson, Winnipeg, Hayes, Whiteshell and Churchill rivers. Most of Manitoba's inhabited south has developed in <b>the</b> <b>prehistoric</b> bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz. This region, particularly the Red River Valley, is flat and fertile; receding glaciers left hilly and rocky areas throughout the province.|$|E
5|$|Many ancient {{standing}} stone monuments were erected during <b>the</b> <b>prehistoric</b> period, {{amongst the}} best-known are Stonehenge, Devil's Arrows, Rudston Monolith and Castlerigg. With {{the introduction of}} Ancient Roman architecture there was a development of basilicas, baths, amphitheaters, triumphal arches, villas, Roman temples, Roman roads, Roman forts, stockades and aqueducts. It was the Romans who founded the first cities and towns such as London, Bath, York, Chester and St Albans. Perhaps the best-known example is Hadrian's Wall stretching right across northern England. Another well-preserved example is the Roman Baths at Bath, Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Sitakunda {{has been}} {{occupied}} by humans since the Neolithic era; tools associated with <b>the</b> <b>prehistoric</b> Assam group {{have been found}} throughout the area. In 1886, shouldered celts manufactured from petrified wood were discovered, as reported by Indian archaeologist Rakhaldas Bandyopadhyay in his book Banglar Itihas, or History of Bengal, (volume I, 1914). In 1917, British mineralogist Dr. J. Coggin Brown uncovered more prehistoric celts. Large quantities of pebbles have also been found, but archaeologists have not determined whether they {{were used in the}} construction of prehistoric tools.|$|E

5|$|The {{area known}} as Croatia today was {{inhabited}} throughout <b>the</b> <b>prehistoric</b> period. Fossils of Neanderthals dating to the middle Palaeolithic period have been unearthed in northern Croatia, with the most famous and the best presented site in Krapina. Remnants of several Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures were found in all regions of the country. The largest proportion of the sites is in the river valleys of northern Croatia, and the most significant cultures whose presence was discovered include Starčevo, Vučedol and Baden cultures. The Iron Age left traces of the early Illyrian Hallstatt culture and the Celtic La Tène culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{kingdom of}} the East Angles was bordered {{to the north and}} east by the North Sea, to the south by mainly impenetrable forests and by the Fens marshes on its western border. The main land route from East Anglia would at that time have been a corridor, along which ran <b>the</b> <b>prehistoric</b> Icknield Way. The Devil's Dyke (near modern Newmarket) may have at one time formed part of the kingdom's western boundary, but its {{construction}} cannot be dated accurately enough to establish it as of Anglo-Saxon origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{unearthed}} Antiquities (of art, architecture, {{customs and}} rituals) indicate that <b>the</b> <b>prehistoric</b> {{people of the}} Burzahom established contact with Central Asia and South West Asia and also had links to the Gangetic plains and peninsular India. The interaction of local and foreign influences is demonstrated by the art, architecture, customs, rituals and language demonstrated by some engravings on pottery and other artifacts. Some historians have stated that the Vedic Aryan culture extended into Kashmir, but archaeological investigation at Burzahom {{does not support the}} theory.|$|E

5|$|While the {{traprock}} cliffs {{remain the}} most obvious evidence of <b>the</b> <b>prehistoric</b> geologic processes of the Metacomet Ridge, the sedimentary rock of the ridge and surrounding terrain has produced equally significant evidence of prehistoric life {{in the form of}} Triassic and Jurassic fossils; in particular, dinosaur tracks. At a state park in Rocky Hill, Connecticut, more than 2,000 well preserved early Jurassic prints have been excavated. Other sites in Holyoke and Greenfield have likewise produced significant finds.|$|E
5|$|At the Corporatie, Vandersteen met a {{colleague}} whose wife worked at Bravo, a weekly Flemish comics magazine that appeared since 1936 {{and had a}} French-language version since 1940. Due to the war conditions, they were desperately in need of local artists to replace the American comics they used to publish. Led by established Walloon illustrator Jean Dratz, a young team was gathered, with artists like Edgar P. Jacobs and Jacques Laudy. Vandersteen joined in 1943, and here his comics career really took off. First he created Tori, a reprise of <b>the</b> <b>prehistoric</b> Tor, and {{a few weeks later}} his new comic Simbat de Zeerover (Simbat the Sailor) was published on the cover and in colour, a first for Vandersteen.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Trigger {{takes place}} in a world {{familiar}} to Earth, with eras such as <b>the</b> <b>prehistoric</b> age, in which primitive humans and dinosaurs share the earth; the Middle Ages, replete with knights, monsters, and magic; and the post-apocalyptic future, where destitute humans and sentient robots struggle to survive. The characters frequently travel through time to obtain allies, gather equipment, and learn information to help them in their quest. The party also gains access to the End of Time (represented as year ∞), which serves as a hub to travel back to other time periods. The party eventually acquires a time-machine vehicle known as the Wings of Time, nicknamed the Epoch. The vehicle is capable of time travel between any time period without first having to travel to the End of Time.|$|E
