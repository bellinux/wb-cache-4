5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the entire map is obscured until explored by the player. <b>The</b> <b>map</b> consists of a landlocked sea with several islands, wreckage, sea creatures, enemy ships, ports, and whirlpools. The player can sometimes encounter message bottles that clear away fog of war on <b>the</b> <b>map</b> to reveal hidden ports.Sea creatures and enemy ships appear randomly and challenge the player for gold or commodities in a card minigame. Ports are trading and safe zones where the player can sell commodities, buy upgrades for the ship, and take on sidequests. Whirlpools teleport the player's ship to a random location on <b>the</b> <b>map.</b>|$|E

5|$|The race {{starts in}} Port Town, with the winners {{traveling}} {{in a boat}} to a large desert. Legend has it that four stone tablets are buried somewhere in the desert, and the contestants are sent out to dig for them {{and bring them to}} the Viscount. According to the stone tablets, the actual location of the Crystal is hidden somewhere on the ancient map. Before he can investigate the matter further, Doctor Neo Cortex swoops in and snatches <b>the</b> <b>map.</b> As the two struggle for <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> <b>the</b> <b>map</b> is torn to shreds.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, a wave of Luftwaffe {{aircraft}} (in the appearance of Balkenkreuz sprites on <b>the</b> <b>map)</b> will cross the English Channel and proceed to bomb various cities, air bases and radar installations. In response, RAF squadrons are automatically scrambled and will await orders to either engage invading Luftwaffe fighters or to defend key cities from bombers. When a RAF squadron has successfully engaged a Luftwaffe unit on <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> the game will shift to a first-person shooter perspective, in which the point of view is portrayed from a cockpit of either a Spitfire or Messerschmitt Bf 109, depending on the side chosen. During the dogfight sequence, the number of Luftwaffe casualties will depend on how many aircraft the player was able to shoot down.|$|E

30|$|In <b>the</b> Futures <b>Map</b> frame it is {{possible}} to solve the conceptual problem concerning scenarios, roadmaps and plans using the distinction between the planning and <b>the</b> <b>mapping</b> horizons. <b>The</b> <b>mapping</b> horizon is <b>the</b> anticipation horizon of <b>the</b> Futures <b>Map</b> (of <b>the</b> possible futures). As in picture 1, a scenario path might de facto end already before <b>the</b> <b>mapping</b> horizon. For example in <b>the</b> Futures <b>Map</b> of a company, the bankruptcy of the company might be an end point for the individual company, but in fact, the scenario without this company might be going on, unconsidered by the managers of the company. However, the time horizon of most scenarios is defined by <b>the</b> <b>mapping</b> horizon.

Finding the Power Crystal is impossible without the Final Key, so the Viscount boards his plane to travel to the North Atlantic Ocean in search for the Final Key. But the plane is full, and only a select number of the contestants are able to board. Propelled to the skies by an explosive volcano, the contestants are able to board the Viscount's plane.|$|E
5|$|Defense of the Ancients is {{maintained}} via official forums. Users can post ideas for new heroes or items, {{some of which}} are added to <b>the</b> <b>map.</b> Players have contributed icons and hero descriptions and created the artwork displayed while <b>the</b> <b>map</b> loads, and suggestions for changes to existing heroes or items are taken seriously; IceFrog once changed a new hero less than two weeks after the new version of <b>the</b> <b>map</b> was released. Versions of the scenario where enemy heroes are controlled by artificial intelligences have also been released. Mescon continued to maintain dota-allstars.com, which by the end of IceFrog's affiliation in May 2009 had over 1,500,000 registered users and had received over one million unique visitors every month. Due to their separation, IceFrog announced that he would be further developing a new official site, playdota.com, while continuing game development; Mescon closed dota-allstars on July 22, 2010, citing dropping statistics and his new passion for League of Legends as the reason for its end.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, Argentine airstrikes will {{frequently}} sink Royal Navy ships, depending on how many of them were initially allocated to defensive positions. In addition, Argentine air forces will occasionally bomb and destroy British forces on the ground, which are represented as animated sprites on <b>the</b> <b>map.</b> <b>The</b> <b>map</b> also displays terrain details, including rivers and mountains. If troops are situated on top of a mountain, they will receive a defensive bonus once attacked; however, due to the steep terrain, they will move more slowly. If the player chooses to enter an enemy-controlled zone, the move will instantly end, leaving the unit vulnerable to an Argentine attack.|$|E

5|$|In 1939 <b>The</b> <b>Map</b> of Love {{appeared}} {{as a collection of}} 16 poems and seven of the 20 short stories published by Thomas in magazines since 1934. Ten stories in his next book, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog (1940), were based less on lavish fantasy than <b>The</b> <b>Map</b> of Love and more on real-life romances featuring himself in Wales. Sales of both books were poor, resulting in Thomas living on meagre fees from writing and reviewing. At this time he borrowed heavily from friends and acquaintances. Hounded by creditors, Thomas and his family left Laugharne in July 1940 and moved to the home of critic John Davenport in Marshfield, Gloucestershire. There Thomas collaborated with Davenport on the satire The Death of the King's Canary, though due to fears of libel the work was not published until 1976.|$|E
