Visualization is an indispensable part when showing information in great detail. Willett and his team designed Scented Widgets, which improves navigation in both popular and undiscovered realms with embedded visualization. They implemented scent metrics with a standard interface widget and used visual encoding for data. Hue, Saturation, Opacity, <b>Text,</b> <b>Icon,</b> Bar Chart and Line Chart are scent encodings to highlight various information, which can display different types of data at the same time. They used Java Swing and the platform’s pluggable look and feel functionality to create and change widgets at runtime. In order to design a user-friendly interface, they followed Scent Encoding, Layout, and Composition guidelines which gave clear instruction in how to use scent widget better showing multiple information.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} Centre for Development of Advanced Computing's (CDACM) {{submission to}} the shared task-'Tool Contest on POS tagging for Code-Mixed Indian Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, and Whatsapp) Text', collocated with ICON- 2016. The shared {{task was to}} predict Part of Speech (POS) tag at word level for a given text. The code-mixed text is generated mostly on social media by multilingual users. The presence of the multilingual words, transliterations, and spelling variations make such content linguistically complex. In this paper, we propose an approach to POS tag code-mixed social media text using Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNN-LM) architecture. We submitted the results for Hindi-English (hi-en), Bengali-English (bn-en), and Telugu-English (te-en) code-mixed data.

40|$|Threshold {{sizes for}} {{accurate}} identification were determined for three {{different types of}} highway signs (<b>text,</b> <b>icon,</b> and modified icon) under two conditions of horizontal target motion (600 and 1200 per second). The two iconic versions were superior to the text version in nearly all cases, and this benefit of the pictorial format was even more pronounced in the higher-velocity condition. The advantage of the modified icon signs over the standard icon signs that had been determined in previous work was replicated here under the low-velocity condition but essen-tially disappeared under the higher-velocity condition. Sign-reading performance {{was found to be}} related to dynamic visual acuity (with Landolt-C targets) under the two velocity conditions. Results are discussed in terms of the "low-pass for-mat " for sign design suggested by previous researchers {{and in terms of the}} poten-tial utility of dynamic acuity for the driving setting...|$|E

The usability evaluation focused on track selection efficiency and included user visualisation preference for this micro-task.

40|$|In his <b>text</b> <b>Icons</b> of Evolution, Jonathan Wells {{endeavors to}} reveal {{some of the}} many {{discrepancies}} supported as scientific fact in current evolution literature. His goal, to discredit such falsely contrived theories as Haeckel’s embryos and Darwin’s finches, is successfully managed through the observance of clear, observational evidence. Meanwhile, Wells renders these so-called “icons” of evolution as nothing more than distorted data. The question of human language origins and the evolutionist’s response serves as another icon in the rhetoric of scientific evolution, yet observations pulled from current scientific research appear to disregard this notion altogether and instead, point towards a higher ordered design. Thus, it is {{the purpose of this study}} to reveal and examine the overt discrepancies surrounding the human language origins controversy, which for too long have been undermined by evolution theorists...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} graphic computing environments, identifies {{potential problems}} in {{providing access to}} blind people, and describes programs and strategies being developed to provide this access. The paper begins with an explanation of how graphic user interfaces differ from character-based systems {{in their use of}} pixels, visual metaphors such as icons and windows, locational and cohtextual information, and mouse-controlled interaction and random access. The paper then analyzes how much of the benefits of the graphic user interface are sared by blind users. Three stages of access to the graphic user interface are described: (1) the customizing stage; (2) the ssingle-sensory mouseless strategy for providing access to standard <b>text,</b> <b>icons</b> and simple graphics, standard graphical structures, and navigation and control; (3) the multisensory approach with a resurrected mouse, designed to extend compatibility across applications and operating systems and exten...|$|R

40|$|The Informedia Digital Video Library user {{interface}} summarizes query results with {{a collage of}} representative keyframes. We present a user study in which keyframe occlusion caused difficulties. To use the screen space most efficiently to display images, both occlusion and wasted whitespace should be minimized. Thus optimal choices will tend toward constant density displays. However, previous constant density algorithms are based on global density, which leads to occlusion and empty space if the density is not uniform. We introduce an algorithm that considers the layout of individual objects and avoids occlusion altogether. Efficiency concerns are important for dynamic summaries of the Informedia Digital Video Library, which has {{hundreds of thousands of}} shots. Posting multiple queries that take into account parameters of the visualization as well as the original query reduces the amount of work required. This greedy algorithm is then compared to an optimal one. The approach is also applicable to visualizations containing complex graphical objects other than images, such as <b>text,</b> <b>icons,</b> or trees. ...|$|R
40|$|Session E 1 - Convergence and Divergence of Belief Systems in AsiaConference Theme: Asia Conflict and CooperationThis paper {{explores the}} {{transmission}} and transformation of Marian devotions from early modern Europe to 17 th-century China. It {{concentrates on the}} dynamic interplay of two key components—virtue and power—that constituted multiple representations and re-interpretations of Mary in the late imperial Chinese context. By examining a group of interrelated Christian <b>texts,</b> <b>icons,</b> and practices, this paper reveals how Catholic missionaries strategically introduced Mary as {{a new model of}} perfect virtues compatible with established Confucian moral ideals, how Mary competed with native goddesses (e. g. Guanyin Bodhisattva) in terms of doctrinal orthodoxy, compassion, child-giving power, and miraculous healing, as well as how Marian devotions helped Chinese converts consolidate their collective religious identity in daily experiences. The paper concludes that the phenomenal rise of a composite Chinese Marian culture {{towards the end of the}} 17 th century contributed to the localization of Christianity from a Western religion to a marginal Chinese religion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{presents}} a comparative study {{on two different}} approaches for visualizing sensor data collected from smart buildings on the web using 3 D virtual environments. The sensor data is provided by sensors that are deployed in real buildings to measure several environmental parameters including temperature, humidity, air quality and air pressure. The first approach uses the three. js WebGL framework to create the 3 D model of a smart apartment where sensor data is illustrated with point and wall visualizations. Point visualizations show sensor values at the real locations of the sensors using <b>text,</b> <b>icons</b> or a mixture of the two. Wall visualizations display sensor values inside panels placed on the interior walls of the apartment. The second approach uses the Unity game engine to create the 3 D model of a 4 -floored hospice where sensor data is illustrated with aforementioned point visualizations and floor visualizations, where the sensor values are shown on the floor around {{the location of the}} sensors in form of color or other effects. The two approaches are compared with respect to their technical performance in terms of rendering speed, model size and request size, and with respect to the relative advantages and disadvantages of the two development environments as experienced in this thesis...|$|R
