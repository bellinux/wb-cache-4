He characterises the alto solos as brief and unremarkable; however, the tenor solo role in PartII is both extensive and demanding, requiring on several occasions <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> choruses. The wide melodic leaps in the Pater Profundus role present particular challenges to the bass soloist.|$|E

2500|$|During a Test {{match between}} South Africa and Sri Lanka on 7 August 2006, Australian TEN Sports {{commentator}} Dean Jones referred to Amla as a [...] "terrorist" [...] {{after he had}} taken a catch; after incorrectly assuming that broadcasting switched to a commercial break, he had said [...] "The terrorist gets another wicket". The broadcast was aired around the world, including South Africa, and he was subsequently widely condemned by South African fans, players and several former cricketers and commentators, leading to the channel terminating its contract with Jones. After the incident Jones reportedly apologized to Amla, stating that his comments were never [...] "supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> air", which he accepted.|$|E
60|$|Most earnestly do I {{hope that}} this republication, {{now for the first}} time, for nearly two hundred years, given in its native {{excellence}} and purity, may be attended with the Divine blessing, to the comfort of many despairing Jerusalem sinners; to the building up of the church of Christ on earth; to the extension of pure, heart-felt, genuine Christianity; and to the confusion of the persecutors. They intended, by shutting the pious pilgrim up in a dungeon, to prevent his voice from being heard to the comfort of his poor neighbours, and by which violence, his persecutors have caused his voice to burst the prison doors and walls, and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> whole world. His 'Pilgrim's Progress,' which was written in prison, has been, and now is, a guide to Christian pilgrims of all nations, kindreds, tribes, and people, teaching them not to rest content in any national religion, but personally to search the Scriptures, with earnest supplications to the God of mercy and truth, that they may be guided to Christ, as the Alpha and Omega of their salvation.|$|E
60|$|The {{aspect of}} things was indeed very changeable. Sometimes, {{as we have}} said, all nature seemed to be steeped in thick darkness, at other times the fires of the volcano blazed upward, {{spreading}} a red glare on the rolling clouds and over the heaving sea. Lightning also played its part as well as thunder, but the latter was scarcely distinguishable from the volcano's roar. Three days before Sunday the 26th of August, Captain Roy--as well as the crews of several other vessels that were in Sunda Straits at the time--had observed a marked though gradual increase in {{the violence of the}} eruption. On that day, as we read in the Report of the Krakatoa Committee of the Royal Society, about 1 p.m. the detonations caused by the explosive action attained such violence as to be heard at Batavia, about 100 English miles away. At 2 p.m. of the same day, Captain Thompson of the Medea, when about 76 miles east-north-east of the island, saw a black mass rising like clouds of smoke to a height which has been estimated at no less than 17 miles! And the detonations were at that time taking place at intervals of ten minutes. But, terrible though these explosions must have been, they were but as the whisperings of the volcano. An hour later they had increased so much as to be heard at Bandong and other places 150 miles away, and at 5 p.m. they had become so tremendous as <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> whole island of Java, the eastern portion of which is about 650 miles from Krakatoa.|$|E

50|$|In some countries, {{such as the}} United Kingdom, back-up warning systems using blasts {{of white}} noise are {{becoming}} more common, and are obligatory for suppliers of some large construction projects.

5000|$|Squillo is a {{technical}} {{term for the}} resonant, trumpet-like sound in the voices of opera singers.
