60|$|In {{the course}} of a day's walk, you see, there is much {{variance}} in the mood. From the exhilaration of the start, to the happy phlegm of the arrival, the change is certainly great. As the day goes on, the traveller moves from the one extreme end towards the other. He becomes more and more incorporated with the material landscape, and the open-air drunkenness grows upon him with great strides, until he posts along the road, and sees everything about him, as in a cheerful dream. The first is certainly brighter, but the second stage is the more peaceful. A man does not make so many articles towards the end, nor does he laugh aloud; but the purely animal pleasures, the sense of physical wellbeing, the delight of every inhalation, of every time the muscles <b>tighten</b> <b>down</b> the thigh, console him for the absence of the others, and bring him to his destination still content.|$|E

5000|$|Blitzes {{are usually}} run from [...] "Cover 1" [...] {{coverage}} shells, which assign one man {{to guard the}} entire deep field, though blitzes can be employed in nearly any coverage scheme. Cover 1 is most effective in terms of blitzing because it allows {{a larger number of}} defensive players to <b>tighten</b> <b>down</b> on the line of scrimmage, thus increasing the variety of blitzes possible.|$|E
5000|$|Pan Bolt: A small {{bolt through}} {{the side of the}} clamp, {{typically}} 1/4" [...] or 3/8" [...] which <b>tightens</b> <b>down</b> onto the spigot, preventing it from rotating (panning).|$|R

50|$|As a CBS-owned station, channel 4 {{cleared the}} entire network schedule. When Viacom {{took over in}} 1986, this changed rather drastically. KMOV began signing off the air at night, thus preempting the {{overnight}} news program CBS News Nightwatch. A barrage of scattered primetime preemptions later followed that was so rampant, the station earned a mention in Ken Auletta's 1991 book, Three Blind Mice. KMOV randomly replaced CBS prime-time shows with programming such as Billy Graham Crusades and National Geographic specials, syndicated movie packages, and occasional sporting events, all of which allowed the station and Viacom full control of the ad time airing during the pre-emptions. According to Auletta, KMOV preempted 103 hours of CBS primetime programs in 1987, accounting for nearly 10 percent of the network primetime schedule. In the 1990s, the primetime preemptions eased as all networks began to <b>tighten</b> <b>down</b> contractually on heavy pre-emptions, and currently, the station only occasionally preempts a CBS primetime show, usually only for breaking news reasons. The station also resumed a 24-hour broadcast schedule in the early 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Until 2009, it was {{acceptable}} for employees in many fields of work (especially construction workers, gardeners and the like) to consume medium quantities of alcohol during work hours. However, occupational safety legislation has since <b>tightened</b> <b>down</b> and has induced {{a significant decrease}} of alcohol consumption during work hours.|$|R
60|$|A {{flat surface}} {{on the side}} of a small hill was selected, and the tents were placed end to end, as before, but <b>tightened</b> <b>down</b> to stay. Then a trench was dug around the sides and the back, so that when it rained the water might drain off. This done, the {{interior}} was carpeted with small branches of pine and evergreen.|$|R
25|$|The second biggest {{factor that}} affects drum sound is head tension against the shell. When the hoop is placed around the drum head and shell and <b>tightened</b> <b>down</b> with tension rods, {{the tension of}} the head can be adjusted. When the tension is increased, the {{amplitude}} of the sound is reduced and the frequency is increased, making the pitch higher and the volume lower.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of tap wrenches: double-end {{adjustable}} wrenches and T-handle wrenches. Double-end adjustable wrenches, also known as bar wrenches, have one threaded handle which is attached {{to one of the}} clamps. The clamp is opened to insert the tool and then <b>tightened</b> <b>down</b> against the tool to secure it. This type of tap wrench is used with larger taps and where there is room to turn a larger wrench.|$|R
50|$|This {{legislation}} was repeatedly revised. In 1887, these administrative quotas were <b>tightened</b> <b>down</b> to 10% within the Pale (still {{double that of}} Jewish percentage), 5% outside the Pale, except Moscow and St. Petersburg which were held at 3%. For many towns in the Pale with significant Jewish population, this resulted in half-empty schools {{and a number of}} potential students forbidden to enroll. Many students were unable to complete their education on the soil of their birth.|$|R

2500|$|If a dog is too large, he {{will not}} be able to get past turns in the tunnel, and will have to be dug to every few feet. [...] If a dog has to dig to the quarry when the tunnel <b>tightens</b> <b>down</b> (as it {{invariably}} will), the dog will have to push dirt behind it to progress, which can result in the dog being “bottled” by dirt from behind. [...] In such a situation the dog will have a very difficult time getting out on its own if it cannot turn around.|$|R
40|$|A 10 -month-old baby {{presented}} with developmental delay. He had flaccid paralysis on physical examination. An MRI {{of the spine}} revealed malformation of the ninth and tenth thoracic vertebral bodies with complete agenesis {{of the rest of}} the spine down that level. The thoracic spinal cord ends at the level of the fifth thoracic vertebra with agenesis of the posterior arches of the eighth, ninth and tenth thoracic vertebral bodies. The roots of the cauda equina appear <b>tightened</b> <b>down</b> and backward and ended into a subdermal fibrous fatty tissue at the level of the ninth and tenth thoracic vertebral bodies (closed meningocele). These findings are consistent with caudal regression syndrome...|$|R

50|$|The FCS {{system was}} {{designed}} by Brian A. Whitty in Elanora, Australia, and patented on November 7, 1995. It can be recognized by the 2 tabs on the fins which are designed {{to fit into a}} securing plug that attaches the fin to the board. The fin tabs are placed in slots which are set into the board by the use of a plug that fits flush with the underside of the board. They are secured into these plugs by the use of set screws which can be <b>tightened</b> <b>down</b> by a fin key or Allen wrench. The plug design and use of set screws enables the fin to be easily removed and installed for storage or travel.|$|R
50|$|The third type of derail is the {{portable}} derail, {{and is used}} by railroad mechanical forces, {{as well as some}} industries. This is often used in conjunction with Blue Flag rules and is temporary in nature. They are placed onto one side of the rail with the derail pointed to the outside of the track. Then there {{is a part of the}} derail that is able to be <b>tightened</b> <b>down</b> to the rail and then secured with a locking mechanism. If the derail is left unlocked for any reason or does not have a locking mechanism deployed then the owner of the derail can face substantial fines if found by an FRA inspector.|$|R
50|$|Box {{connectors}} join conduit to a {{junction box}} or other electrical box. A typical box connector is inserted into a knockout in a junction box, with the threaded end then being secured with a ring (called a lock nut) {{from within the}} box, as a bolt would be secured by a nut. The {{other end of the}} fitting usually has a screw or compression ring which is <b>tightened</b> <b>down</b> onto the inserted conduit. Fittings for non-threaded conduits are either secured with set screws or with a compression nut that encircles the conduit. Fittings for general purpose use with metal conduits may be made of die-cast zinc, but where stronger fittings are needed, they are made of copper-free aluminum or cast iron.|$|R
5|$|Legend of Mana was {{designed}} as a 2D game, despite the PlayStation's 3D-focus, as the console could not handle the full 3D world Ishii envisioned where one could interact with natural shaped objects. Kawazu initially let Ishii have a relaxed schedule and budget, as Ishii had a great number of ideas he wanted in the game, but when the project began to get out of control and out of time Kawazu <b>tightened</b> <b>down</b> the rest of the development schedule and convinced the Square executives to delay the game by two months—even though it had already been announced to the public—to allow it to be completed as Ishii envisioned. Kawazu has said that this experience taught him that his true skill in game development lay in working as a producer.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the state}} was rigidly anti-slavery, {{numerous}} laws were enacted intended to curb {{the activities of the}} Underground Railroad {{and put an end to}} blacks escaping through Indiana. Several governors <b>tightened</b> <b>down</b> on the organization and more rigidly enforced the federal Fugitive Slave Laws. By 1851, popular opinion led to a clause being put into the Indiana Constitution that banned all free blacks from entering the state. Many in the government wanted to prevent all blacks from entering Indiana, and they saw that only solution to keeping the slave catchers out of the state. There were many incidents between the slave catchers and citizens of the state that resulted in violence, and anything that could be done to ease tensions between the free states and slaves states was deemed appropriate.|$|R

5000|$|Bolts {{are often}} {{used to make a}} bolted joint. This is a {{combination}} of the nut applying an axial clamping force and also the shank of the bolt acting as a dowel, pinning the joint against sideways shear forces. For this reason, many bolts have a plain unthreaded shank (called the [...] ) as this makes for a better, stronger dowel. The presence of the unthreaded shank has often been given as characteristic of bolts vs. screws, [...] but this is incidental to its use, rather than defining. The grip length should be chosen carefully, to be around the same length as the thickness of the materials, and any washers, bolted together. Too short places the dowel shear load onto the threads, which may cause fretting wear on the hole. Too long prevents the nut from being <b>tightened</b> <b>down</b> correctly. No more than two turns of the thread should be within the hole.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} days, most {{companies}} that manufactured holds used a resin mixture. Early mixtures of Polyester Resin had issues with wear and tear, often becoming chipped and cracked. The chipped or broken {{edge of a}} resin hold can often provide an unintended place to grab that can be sharp or otherwise dangerous to the climber. Because resin holds are not flexible, they will may crack if they are being <b>tightened</b> <b>down</b> on a wall that is not completely flat. Modern polyester mixes have largely overcome these problems. A final problem is the weight of resin holds. As hold sizes have grown and grown, in many cases resin has become an impractical material to use. However, using {{a process known as}} hollow-backing the weight of the hold can be dramatically reduced. Modern production methods such as hollow-backing are keeping polyester as the preferred choice for many climbing walls and hold production companies.|$|R
5000|$|The {{systematic}} {{policy of}} discrimination banned Jewish people {{from rural areas}} and towns of fewer than ten thousand people, even within the Pale, assuring the slow death of many shtetls. In 1887, the quotas placed {{on the number of}} Jews allowed into secondary and higher education were <b>tightened</b> <b>down</b> to 10% within the Pale, 5% outside the Pale, except Moscow and Saint Petersburg, held at 3%, even though the Jewish population was a majority or plurality in many communities. It was possible to evade this restrictions upon secondary education by combining private tuition with examination as an [...] "outside student". Accordingly, within the Pale such outside pupils were almost entirely young Jews. The restrictions placed on education, traditionally highly valued in Jewish communities, resulted in ambition to excel over the peers and increased emigration rates. Special quotas restricted Jews from entering profession of law, limiting number of Jews admitted to the bar.|$|R

40|$|The maximum {{preload torque}} of implant {{prosthetic}} retaining screws from four manufacturers and of two alloy types was measured to determine one index of interchangeability of intersystem components. Materials and Methods : Implant prosthetic retaining screws from four manufacturers (3 i Implant Innovations Inc, West Palm Beach, FL; Impla-Med Inc, Sunrise, FL; Nobelpharma USA Inc, Chicago, IL; and Implant Support Systems Inc, Irvine, CA) and of two metal types (gold and titanium) were investigated using an in vitro simulation model. Five screws {{of each type}} were <b>tightened</b> <b>down</b> against a gold cylinder using a Tohnichi BTG- 6 torque gauge (Tohnichi American Corporation, Northbrook, IL) until fracture occurred. Results : The 3 i Implant Innovations gold and the Nobelpharma gold were not significantly different. The 3 i Implant Innovations titanium and the Impla-Med gold were able to withstand less preload torque than the 3 i Implant Innovations gold and the Nobelpharma gold. The Implant Support Systems titanium was able to withstand significantly more preload torque {{than all of the}} other screws. Conclusions : Interchanging implant prosthetic retaining screws could introduce new and unknown variables that may affect the long-term survival of implant fixtures and/or the implant prostheses...|$|R
50|$|The {{lack of a}} {{locking bar}} on many Weaver-type {{accessories}} also lends to another alignment issue: Canting. Though this problem is not common {{it can be very}} problematic especially with scopes. Because scopes need to be mounted to a rifle in perfect parallel to the barrel and to ensure the cross hairs sit exactly where a bullet will go (POI), a small variation of even ¼ of one degree can cause massive problems at longer ranges. The locking bar holds the mount in a perfect 90 degree to the rail system where as a non-locking bar system can cant to the left or right. This canting (sometimes called jamming of surfaces) is caused by not matching the clamping surface perfectly to the rail. When <b>tightened</b> <b>down,</b> stress exerted on the base can cause the scope to be off from the POI by as much as several feet at 100-200 yards and gets progressively worse the farther out the range goes. Lower grade materials used in manufacturing of scope bases, inconsistent design tolerances from one manufacturer to another and other factors can cause twisting stress and cause the mount to move out of parallel with the rifle barrel. The locking bar system allows for even stress to be distributed and prevent canting of the scope mount.|$|R
25|$|Since 1989, {{entering}} Downing Street {{has required}} {{passing through a}} security checkpoint. The street is patrolled by armed police from the Diplomatic Protection Group, and there is usually at least one police officer outside {{the front door of}} Number 10. Security was <b>tightened</b> after 10 <b>Downing</b> Street was mortar bombed by the IRA in 1991.|$|R
50|$|A {{much more}} active {{approach}} to monitoring tire pressures involves retrofitting a tire pressure monitor to your vehicle. Vehicles manufactured after model year 2007 {{are required to}} have tire pressure monitoring systems built-in, although many older vehicles might not have it. Tire rack, for example, offers aftermarket tire pressure monitors from various companies, including one that notifies {{the driver of the}} tire pressure in each wheel, as well as exactly which tire the system is displaying the pressure of. A much less expensive way to monitor tire pressures is to install valve stem caps that alert the driver to low tire pressure. These work by first setting the pressure on the cap matching the pressure you desire your tires to be at. Once installed on the tire's valve stem, the tip of these caps will change color (from green, to yellow, to red) when the tire becomes under-inflated. The benefit of this system is its low initial cost, but its disadvantages include questionable accuracy (even more so if the caps aren't <b>tightened</b> <b>down</b> enough) and {{that the only way to}} monitor them is from outside of the vehicle, looking directly at the cap. It's always a good idea to have a quality, reliable tire gauge on hand regardless of what system is installed in your vehicle, and to either check tire pressures yourself of by having someone else do it, as most tire pressure monitor systems will not alert the driver until the tire pressure falls below a certain amount, usually 20% below the recommended pressure.|$|R

50|$|After {{forcing the}} Steelers to punt {{on the opening}} drive, the Patriots marched 70 yards in just 8 plays, scoring on a 19-yard {{touchdown}} pass from Brady to Gronkowski. After the Steelers punted, the Patriots drove to the 12, but the Steelers #1 ranked defense <b>tightened</b> <b>down,</b> and forced the Patriots to a 30-yard field goal by Shayne Graham, increasing their lead to 10-0. Two possessions later, The Steelers drove to the Patriots 4, but settled for a 22-yard field goal by Jeff Reed, making the score 10-3. Both teams punted {{for the rest of}} the half and the Patriot led 10-3 at halftime. The Patriots opened up a scoring barrage in the 2nd half. On the opening possession of the 3rd quarter, the Patriots marched 78 yards in a perfectly balanced 10 play (5 passes, 5 rushes) drive, scoring on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Gronkowski, increasing their lead to 17-3. After both teams punted, the Steelers drove 59 (aided by a 38-yard pass interference call on Brandon Meriweather)yards to the Patriots 8-yard line, but Reed missed a 26-yard field goal. The Patriots took advantage, marching 80 yards in 7 plays, scoring on Brady's 3-yard touchdown run, with a missed extra point, increasing the Patriots lead to 23-3. The Steelers countered on their next drive, racing 71 yards in 7 plays, scoring on a 6-yard touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger to Emmanuel Sanders, trimming the deficit to 23-10. After the Patriots punted, Roethlisberger was intercepted by James Sanders who returned the interception 32 yards for a touchdown, increasing the lead to 29-10 after the missed two point conversion. Sanders returned the ensuing kick 26 yards to the Patriots 47 and the Steelers raced 53 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on a 15-yard touchdown pass to Mike Wallace, with a successful two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to 29-18. After recovering the onside kick, the Patriots put the game away, marching effortlessly, 41 yards in only 5 plays, scoring on a 25-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, his third touchdown reception of the game, giving the Patriots an insurmountable 36-18 lead with 4:23 remaining. Ben Roethlisberger completed four passes, all to Mike Wallace on the next drive, including a 33-yard touchdown pass, with another successful 2 point conversion, trimming the deficit to 36-26, but the Patriots' Alge Crumpler recovered the onside kick. Graham added the final points of the game with a 36-yard field goal, bringing the score to 39-26. Pittsburgh drove to New England's 15 with a few seconds left, but couldn't score.|$|R
5000|$|Impact {{wrenches}} {{are available}} in all sizes and in several styles, depending on the application. ¼" [...] drive wrenches are commonly available in both inline (the user holds the tool like a screwdriver, with the output on the end) and pistol grip (the user holds a handle which is {{at right angles to}} the output) forms, and less commonly in an angle drive, which is similar to an inline tool but with a set of bevel gears to rotate the output 90°. ⅜" [...] impacts are most commonly available in pistol grip form and a special inline form known as a [...] "butterfly" [...] wrench, which has a large, flat throttle paddle {{on the side of the}} tool which may be tilted to one side or the other to control the direction of rotation, rather than using a separate reversing control, and shaped to allow access into tight areas. Regular inline and angle ⅜" [...] drive impact wrenches are uncommon, but available. ½" [...] drive units are virtually only available in pistol grip form, with any inline type being virtually impossible to obtain, due to the increased torque transmitted back to the user and the greater weight of the tool requiring the larger handle. ¾" [...] drive impact wrenches are again essentially only available in pistol grip form. 1" [...] drive tools {{are available in}} both pistol grip and [...] "D handle" [...] inline, where the back of the tool has an enclosed handle for the user to hold. Both forms often also incorporate a side handle, allowing both hands to hold the tool at once. 1¼" [...] and larger wrenches are usually available in [...] "T handle" [...] form, with two large handles on either side of the tool body, allowing for maximum torque to be applied to the user, and giving the best control of the tool. Very large impact wrenches (up to several hundred thousand foot-pounds of torque) usually incorporate eyelets in their design, allowing them to be suspended from a crane, lift, or other device, since their weight is often more than a person can move. A recent design combines an impact wrench and an air ratchet, often called a [...] "reactionless air ratchet" [...] by the manufacturers, incorporating an impact assembly before the ratchet assembly. Such a design allows very high output torques with minimal effort on the operator, and prevents the common injury of slamming one's knuckles into some part of the equipment when the fastener <b>tightens</b> <b>down</b> and the torque suddenly increases. Specialty designs are available for certain applications, such as removing crankshaft pulleys without removing the radiator in a vehicle.|$|R
