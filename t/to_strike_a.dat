5|$|Cicero, upon {{becoming}} consul, immediately moved <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>a</b> {{deal with}} his consular colleague Hybrida, who had supported Catiline and his party, and who might join a rebellion against the state. In exchange for what amounted to the sole consulship for Cicero, Hybrida was to receive the rich consular province of Macedonia. Hybrida himself was heavily in debt and was wasteful of his money, and the wealth of Macedonia {{could be used by}} him to restore his lost fortune.|$|E
5|$|Lily's {{effects in}} Puerto Vallarta {{made it the}} second {{hurricane}} of the season to be declared the worst hurricane <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>a</b> specific city in twenty or more years. The first was Hurricane Bridget, which struck Acapulco. Despite the damage, the name was not retired and was reused in 1975, but due {{to a change in}} names lists in 1978, the name Lily has not been used since.|$|E

5|$|The new {{commissioner}} {{spent the}} second half of 1906 attending ICC hearings around the country. The Hepburn Act had given the Commission broad powers over the railroads, and the Commission worked to deal not only with past railroad abuses, but <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>a</b> balance between the desires of railroads and those of shippers.|$|E
5|$|With Irvine, Nomura tried <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>a</b> {{balance between}} not overshadowing Squall and not {{becoming}} too unattractive. He gave Irvine a handsome appearance, but a casual personality, hoping {{that this would}} make him less attractive than Squall. Keeping with this idea, Nomura gave him goggles; however, this idea was abandoned {{in favor of an}} American cowboy-like appearance to set him apart from other goggle-wearing characters in the Final Fantasy series.|$|E
5|$|After murdering both Mazhar and Shantaram, Vijay brings Mazhar's corpse to Lala, {{who falls}} sick and is {{admitted}} into a hospital. In the meantime, Vijay takes over Lala's empire and stops all the {{crimes committed by}} Lala's gang. He is then contacted by Kancha and offers to go to Mandwa for a business agreement. While in Mandwa, Vijay tries <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>a</b> deal with Kancha {{to hand over the}} drug business in Mumbai over to Kancha and in return taking Mandwa. Though Kancha initially suspects this deal, he later agrees on the condition that Gaitonde must be killed.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, Andronicus tried {{once more}} <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>a</b> decisive blow {{back at the}} Turks, this time hiring Catalan mercenaries. Under the {{guidance}} of Michael IX and the leadership of Roger de Flor, the 6,500-strong Catalan Company {{in the spring and}} summer of 1303 managed to drive back the Turks. The mercenaries' onslaught drove the Turks back from Philadelphia to Cyzicus, in the process causing great destruction to the Anatolian landscape. Once again these gains were thwarted by internal matters. Roger de Flor was assassinated and, in revenge, his company began pillaging the Anatolian countryside. When they finally left in 1307 to attack Byzantine Thrace, the locals welcomed the Ottomans who once again began blockading key fortresses in Asia Minor.|$|E
5|$|Duhalde was {{appointed}} {{president in the}} aftermath of the September 11 attacks, when the foreign policy of the United States was strictly focused on the War on Terror. Initially, the Argentine society was divided on how to manage the bilateral relations with the US. One group wanted to keep the close relations of the previous decade, as Argentina might need foreign help to deal with the crisis. The other group preferred to maintain more distant relations. Duhalde sought <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>a</b> balance between both options, and eventually leaned towards the second when the US refused to help Argentina.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, unbearably {{inadequate}} {{housing and}} overcrowded neighborhoods pushed working {{men out of}} the home and into saloons where they congregated for drink and discussion. Wealthy capitalists wishing <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>a</b> balance between the demands of labor and desires of capital looked to Robert Owen's example. George Pullman and William Halliday implemented a policy of tolerance in their towns identical to that of Robert Owen. The peaceful atmosphere in Pullman and Hallidayboro can be attributed in part to the absence of alcohol.|$|E

5|$|Janmashtami is {{the main}} festival that is celebrated during August and September with great fervor and piety {{as it was in}} the prehistoric times the abode of Krishna. The festival is marked by several night long {{celebrations}} to mark the birth of Krishna. Bhajans and sermons are part of the festivities. At midnight there is reenactment of Krishna's childhood in the form of Garba and Raas dances. On this occasion, the local boys create a pyramid and a young boy in the costume of Krishna climbs up this pyramid <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>a</b> pot holding butter, an act which Krishna had mischievously performed with the gopis.|$|E
5|$|Like regular {{characters}} in Fortress mode, characters have thirst, hunger and exhaustion levels. To survive, they must eat, drink and sleep. They {{need to take}} shelter at night when evil creatures like bogeymen come out. In addition to the regular combat mechanism, in this mode, the player can also choose which body parts <b>to</b> <b>strike.</b> <b>A</b> player can visit their retired or ruined fortresses made in Fortress mode. Instead of quitting, the character can be retired, and depending on the player's achievements, their life events will be documented in the Legends mode among the historical figures.|$|E
5|$|Story and {{characters}} were a primary concern for Gilbert and Winnick. The pair based the game's cast on friends, family members, acquaintances, and stereotypes. For example, Winnick's girlfriend Ray was {{the inspiration for}} Razor, while Dave and Wendy were based, respectively, on Gilbert and a fellow Lucasfilm employee named Wendy. According to Winnick, the Edison family was shaped after characters from EC Comics and Warren Publishing magazines. The sentient meteor that brainwashes Dr. Fred {{was inspired by a}} segment from the 1982 anthology film Creepshow. A man-eating plant, similar to that of Little Shop of Horrors, was included as well. The developers sought <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>a</b> balance between tension and humor with the game's story.|$|E

40|$|The ruling Laval is {{a ruling}} of {{clarification}} and innovation: it clarified {{that the conditions}} of work contained in collective agreements may only be applied when those agreements have been extended to all employers; it innovated by declaring the right <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> as <b>a</b> fundamental right, by applying the obligations arising from the fundamental freedoms to behaviour of private parties and by subjecting the exercise of the right <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> proportionality test...|$|R
5|$|The V-2 rocket was one {{of several}} {{innovative}} long-range weapons developed by the Germans after the failure of the Luftwaffe <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>a</b> decisive blow against Britain. It was a revolutionary weapon – the world's first operational SRBM – that had been developed in a secret programme begun in 1936. The German leadership hoped that a barrage of rockets unleashed against London would force Britain out of the war. Although Adolf Hitler was at first ambivalent, he eventually became an enthusiastic supporter of the V-2 programme as Allied air forces carried out increasingly devastating attacks on German cities.|$|E
5|$|Though the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence {{was made}} on 17 August 1945, news did not reach Riau until September. In the {{following}} months, Soeman {{was elected to the}} newly formed Indonesian National Committee for Pasir Pengaraian, and later made its chairman. In this capacity, he had <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>a</b> balance between former colonial staff who were looking forward to a Dutch return and those who supported an independent Indonesia; Dutch forces were returning to Java, and physical conflict had already broken out between Allied forces and the Indonesian republicans in Surabaya. The following year, Soeman was elected to the Regional Representatives' Council for Riau, based out of Pekanbaru.|$|E
5|$|Under Basil's son and successor, Leo VI the Wise, {{the gains}} in the east against the now-weak Abbasid Caliphate continued. However, Sicily was lost to the Arabs in 902, and in 904 Thessaloniki, the Empire's second city, was sacked by an Arab fleet. The naval {{weakness}} of the Empire was rectified. Despite this revenge the Byzantines were still unable <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>a</b> decisive blow against the Muslims, who inflicted a crushing defeat on the imperial forces when they attempted to regain Crete in 911.|$|E
50|$|Despite his {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>an</b> {{image as a}} fresh government, Grimes and his Liberals were defeated in the October 2003 provincial election by the Progressive Conservatives under Danny Williams, bringing an end to 14 years of Liberal rule in Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|R

5000|$|The ILO Committee on Freedom of Association {{and other}} ILO bodies have, however, {{interpreted}} all core ILO conventions as protecting the right <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> as <b>an</b> {{essential element of}} the freedom of association.

5|$|A poll {{following}} the 2008 summit showed that 82.5 percent of citizens surveyed opposed changing the constitutional name {{in order to}} join NATO. Elections were called {{following the}} 2008 summit, resulting in further support for the centre-right pro-NATO party, VMRO-DPMNE. The elections were marred by violence that was criticized by NATO members. Ethnic tensions have persisted in Macedonia, and NATO has called for dialogue following clashes {{such as those in}} the city of Kumanovo in 2015, which were blamed in part on the delay in NATO and European integration. NATO membership in general is supported by 81 percent according to a November 2014 poll. On 12 June 2017, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev signaled that he will consider alternatives names for the country in order <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>a</b> compromise with Greece, settle the naming dispute, and lift Greek objections to Macedonia joining the alliance. Zaev also floated the idea of Macedonia joining the alliance under the provisional name it uses at the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|By 11:04, Lindmayr's Dorniers {{had reached}} Calais. Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, Park’s senior fighter controller, watched with the Prime Minister and Park as the Germans moved closer. De Broke {{had a problem}} of his own. He {{had no way of}} knowing which plots {{represented}} bombers and fighters. Bombers had to be intercepted, fighters could be ignored. The trick was <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>a</b> balance and time the interception as well as possible. On one hand he must scramble early and allow enough time to get into a favourable attack position; but on the other hand he had to avoid scrambling them too early lest the fighters run short of fuel before they met the enemy. Park joined de Broke. After a brief discussion he decided to commit several squadrons from RAF Biggin Hill. Park realised the raid could be a trap. Though the target seemed to be London, the aircraft, comprising 120–150 in number, may be an advanced guard of Bf 109s sent to clear the skies or disrupt fighter defences. Still, he gambled and sent nine squadrons into action at 11:15.|$|E
5|$|Demosthenes {{tailored}} {{his style}} {{to be very}} audience-specific. He took pride in not relying on attractive words but rather simple, effective prose. He was mindful of his arrangement, he used clauses to create patterns that would make seemingly complex sentences easy for the hearer to follow. His tendency to focus on delivery promoted him to use repetition, this would ingrain the importance into the audience's minds; he also relied on speed and delay to create suspense and interest among the audience when presenting to most important aspects of his speech. One of his most effective skills was his ability <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>a</b> balance: his works were complex so that the audience would not be offended by any elementary language, {{but the most important}} parts were clear and easily understood.|$|E
50|$|Rows of {{stacks of}} tyres {{are often used}} as {{barriers}} in motor racing circuits {{as a method of}} dissipating kinetic energy {{over a longer period of}} time during <b>a</b> crash, comparatively <b>to</b> <b>striking</b> <b>a</b> less malleable material such as a concrete or steel wall.|$|R
50|$|Warning {{shots are}} not {{advisable}} {{in the civilian}} sector as a shot fired into the air or other object has the ability <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>an</b> unintended target or ricochet. Warning shots are specifically contraindicated in almost every civilian firearms training course for this reason.|$|R
