30|$|Thin ZnO nanosheets are {{considered}} to exhibit unique advantages in applications of nanophotonics, nanosensor arrays, and nanocantilevers, etc. [18, 20 – 22]. ZnO nanosheets with or without branched structures have been synthesized by various methods, including chemical vapor deposition [9, 17], thermal evaporation [18], and hydrothermal methods [23]. Depending on growth temperatures, precursors, or substrates, ZnO nanosheets with diverse morphologies (i.e., double-sided, one-sided, <b>tapered</b> <b>teeth)</b> could be fabricated. However, ultrathin P-doped ZnO nanosheets were seldom synthesized, and very few reports focused {{on the effect of}} carrier gases on the formation of branched nanostructures. Tailoring the morphologies by controlling the carrier gas provides a simple yet effective way in synthesizing ultrathin ZnO nanosheets with branched structures. In this work, we demonstrated that such structural revolution process of ZnO could be tuned by oxygen content in carrier gas, and ultrathin P-doped ZnO nanosheets with branched structures can be reproducibly produced at a proper oxygen flow rate. Meanwhile, the effect of P doping on the morphology evolution was studied in detail, and the growth mechanism of ultrathin P-doped ZnO nanosheets with branched structures was comprehensively investigated.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} {{referred to}} here provided {{information concerning the}} epidemiology of hypodontia and its association with other developmental anomalies. Current research with the major developments in molecular biology {{has focused on the}} genetic component of the aetiology mainly on animals. Limited information has been gained from human studies concerning the morphology of different teeth in hypodontia. The present research is both methodological and investigative in nature. The aims of this study were to measure crown morphology of the permanent dentitions for hypodontia subjects divided according to severity of hypodontia into mild, moderate and severe groups and a control group, and then to compare the measurements of groups. All subjects were of white Caucasian origin and were unrelated. The study groups were balanced for size (N = 40), gender (N = 20) and age. The effect of both severity of hypodontia and gender were examined. The total study population was N= 161. A new measurement system using image analysis and new measurement index for <b>tooth</b> <b>taper</b> were developed, validated and then utilised in the main study. The image analysis technique and <b>tooth</b> <b>taper</b> measurement were validated against the classical manual measurements and subjective scoring respectively. The errors of measurements were assessed by duplicate measurements to determine the intra- and inter-observer reproducibility. It was found that measurements for all study variables were repeatable without systematic error and with small method error. Comprehensive measurements (N = 15) were obtained from both the buccal and occlusal views for the following dimensions of tooth crowns: The principal mesiodistal (MDb and MDo) and buccolingual (BL), proportional mesiodistal (MD 25, MD 50 and MD 75) and buccolingual (BLm and BLd), occlusogingival (OG), perimeter (Pb and Po), area (Ab and Ao) and the distance between MDb and occlusal level (Db) and between MDo and buccal border of tooth crown (Do). A number of indices (N = 5) to evaluate tooth crown morphology were also calculated: <b>Tooth</b> <b>taper</b> determination index (MD 50 /MD 75), crown indices of buccal morphology (CIBMI and CIBM 2 i. e. MDb/OG and Db/OG respectively) and crown indices of occlusal morphology (CIOMI and CIOM 2 i. e. MDo/BL and Do/BL respectively). Two-way analysis of variance followed by multi-comparison tests with Bonferroni adjustment for the significance levels were employed in the main study. The results of the main study revealed significant differences between hypodontia groups and control subjects for the following measurement variables: MDb, Db, OG, Pb, Ab, MD 25, MD 50, MD 75, <b>tooth</b> <b>taper,</b> CIBM 2, MDo, Do, BL, Ao, Po, BLm and BLd. Hypodontia subjects demonstrated significantly smaller measurement values than controls except Db, <b>tooth</b> <b>taper</b> and CIBM 2. The severity of hypodontia affected the degree of difference in tooth morphology; for many variables the more severe the hypodontia the greater the difference from controls. There were only a few significant differences between hypodontia and control groups for the variables CIBM 1, CIOM 1 and CIOM 2. Gender differences (within groups) indicated that males tend to show larger measurements than females although few findings reached statistical significance. The symmetry of right and left measurements (MDb and <b>tooth</b> <b>taper),</b> the number of cusps in the premolar and molar teeth and the intermaxillary ratios were investigated. The findings suggest that asymmetry in bilateral measurements appeared to be increased in hypodontia subjects. Descriptive data also suggest that all the intermaxillary ratios tend to be larger in hypodontia than the control group. There was a tendency for the {{reduction in the number of}} cusps for hypodontia subjects than controls. Again, these findings were related to severity of hypodontia. Thus, variation in tooth morphology in patients with hypodontia was clearly established. The differences were related to the severity of the condition. However, there were also variations in the measurements between individuals with hypodontia of the same severity group. A possible explanation is the multifactorial aetiology of the condition. In certain groups, especially with severe hypodontia, the small numbers of some tooth types which developed may also have influenced the results...|$|R

In group III the root canals were approached conventionally only. In all groups the root canal filling was performed with AH Plus endodontic sealer and gutta-percha points. An en face OCT prototype was used for the investigation of apical microleakage. According to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and en face OCT, the number of defects in the laser groups was significantly lower (P< 0. 005) than in the control group.

The effect of the roller <b>tooth’s</b> <b>taper</b> angle, imprint depth, imprint temperature, and imprint direction on the imprint force, adhesion, stress distribution, and strain are investigated. A two-stage roller imprint process was obtained from an imprint force curve. The two-stage imprint process included the imprint forming with a rapid increase of imprint force and the unloading stage combined with the adhesion stage. The {{results show that the}} imprint force and adhesion rapidly increase with decreasing taper angle and increasing imprint depth. The magnitude of the maximum imprint force and the time at which this maximum occurs are proportional to the imprint depth, but independent of the taper angle. In a comparison of the imprint mechanisms with a vertical imprint case, while high stress and strain regions are concentrated below the mold for vertical imprint, they also occur around the mold in the case of roller imprint. The regions were only concentrated on the substrate atoms underneath the mold in vertical imprint. Plastic flow increased with increasing imprint temperature.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Dent) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Health Sciences, 1998. This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} observation that in some subjects w ith early-onset periodontitis there is a peculiar tapering slenderness of root form. This study compares the degree of taper of the roots of maxillary second premolars, and of the distal roots of mandibular first molars of patients with early-onset periodontitis experimental subjects), {{with that of the}} corresponding roots of control subjects. It seeks to determine whether the degree of taper is ascribable to a particular part of the root; whether differences if any are related to gender or to race; and whether the molars or the premolars would be better diagnostic aids to, and predictors of disease. Periapical radiographs of tw enty teeth of each type were selected for the experimental am control groups. Accurate large scale tracings of the root outlines were made from radiographs. Using the mesiodistal widths of the roots at the cemento-enamel junction {{in the case of the}} premolars, and at the root bifurcation in the case of the distal roots of the molars as baseline measurements, the degrees of taper of the roots were determined. Statistical comparison of the degrees of taper of roots from experimental subjects with those of the roots of control subjects iv showed strong evidence of a sharper degree of taper in the former; this was more pronounced for the premolars than for the molars. The degree of taper was more marked in the apical half of the roots of experimental molars; but in experimental premolars the increased taper was evident throughout the entire length of the root. In the case of the experimental molar roots, there is a relationship between race and the degree of taper: this highlights the desirability of future studies examining the root forms of racially segregated groups. There is no relationship between gender and the tapering of the experimental molar roots. For premolars the increased <b>taper</b> of experimental <b>teeth</b> is related neither to race nor to gender. Prediction and diagnosis of disease is more reliable with premolars than with molars, because the latter taper more sharply only along a portion of their roots. In an affected individual, the maxillary second premolar appears to be a reliable predictor and an indicator of early-onset periodontitis. The distal root of the mandibular first molar likewise is a predictor and an indicator of early-onset periodontitis; but as its degree of taper is less pronounced and occurs only in the apical half of the root, its reliability in these roles may be diminished...|$|R
