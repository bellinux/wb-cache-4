Protesters gathered in front of Terminal 4, where international arrivals take place. As advocacy groups, such as the New York Immigration Coalition, called out to protestors on social media, the crowd grew. The protestors were gathered to denounce Trump's executive order and to show support for refugees and immigrants. The demonstration became large enough by sunset that it spread into the parking deck near the terminal. Demonstrators brought signs, chanted slogans and called the action a [...] "Muslim ban".

There were also Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) issued by automobile manufacturers from automotive manufacturers including Acura/Honda that caused the company to release the white paper on this research. The main focus of the research looked at the spring like connection devices.

50|$|On August 12, 2009, Delta Air Lines and US Airways {{announced}} a landing slot and terminal swap in separate press releases. Under the swap plan, US Airways {{would have given}} Delta 125 operating slot pairs at LaGuardia. US Airways, in return, would have received 42 operating slot pairs at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., and be granted the authority to begin service from the US to São Paulo, Brazil and Tokyo, Japan. When the swap plan was complete, Delta Shuttle operations would have moved from the Marine Air <b>Terminal</b> <b>to</b> <b>Terminal</b> C (the present US Airways terminal), and Terminals C and D would have been connected together. US Airways Shuttle flights would have moved to the Marine Air Terminal, and mainline US Airways flights would have moved to Terminal D (the present Delta terminal). The United States Department of Transportation announced that they would approve the Delta/US Airways transaction {{under the condition that}} they sell slots to other airlines. Delta and US Airways dropped the slot swap deal in early July 2010 and both airlines filed a court appeal. In May 2011, both airlines announced that they would resubmit their proposal of the slot swap to the US DOT. It was tentatively approved by the US DOT on July 21, 2011.

40|$|Field Effect Transistors {{exhibit a}} variety of {{complicated}} dynamic and nonlinear interactions that this session will attempt to demystify. The dynamics include self heating, bias dependent change in trapped charge, and variations due to impact ionization.

A similar contribution to distortion arising from external impedances is intimately linked to the nonlinearity of the FET. Identifying and characterizing FET dynamics and linearity is a key step in the design process, but {{a variety of}} measurement issues arise. These include extraction of intrinsic characteristics, exploration of nonlinearities across the whole spectrum, and determination of rate dependencies from small-signal and pulse data.

40|$|It is now {{becoming}} {{clear that the}} characteristics of the whole junction are important in determining the conductance of single molecules bound between two metal contacts. This paper shows through measurements on a series of seven conjugated molecular bridges that contact separation {{is an important factor in}} determining the electrical response of the molecular junction. These data are obtained using the I (t) method developed by Haiss et al since the scanning tunnelling microscope tip to substrate separation can be controlled through choice of the set-point (I- 0) current and calibrated with current-distance curves and knowledge of the <b>terminal</b> <b>to</b> <b>terminal</b> length of the molecular wire. The contact gap separation dependence is interpreted as arising from tilting of these molecules in the junction and this model is underpinned by ab initio transport computations. In this respect we make the general observation that conductance increases rather dramatically at higher tilt angle away from the normal for conformationally rigid molecular wires and that this increase in conductance arises from increased electronic coupling between the molecular bridge and the gold contacts...|$|E

40|$|The idea of {{incorporating}} user deployed local area networks with wide area networks {{to create an}} interoperable multi-access environment has been gaining popularity. For the case where this multi-access environment is managed by multiple entities, quality of service (QoS) remains guaranteed {{as long as the}} different operators cooperate and agree upon centralized radio resource management (RRM) schemes. For the environment where centralized RRM techniques can not be applied {{due to the lack of}} coordination between different operators, word of mouth (WoM) circulation appears to be a promising solution for providing guaranteed QoS. WoM circulation involves exchange of reputation grades about the QoS of localized networks among roaming users in a <b>terminal</b> <b>to</b> <b>terminal</b> fashion. But this kind of decentralized distribution of reputation grades may turn into a potential threat to the energy and memory reserves of the user equipment. To study the energy consumption involving WoM transfer between the roaming users, a multi-access system is simulated which has full coverage from the cellular network and only has partial coverage from a single access point (AP). The behavior of the AP is depicted by two separate AP models. In the first AP model, the RRM policie...|$|E
40|$|Concurrent {{feedback}} is the continuous {{provision of information}} regarding task performance given during the performance, while terminal {{feedback is}} the provision of this information only {{at the conclusion of}} the task. The following study examined performance on VO 2 max tests (VO 2 max, time to exhaustion, HR and RER) using these two types of feedback. Participants consisted of 14 males and 10 females with a mean age of 21. 7 ± 2 years. Stratified random sampling was used to assign participants to either concurrent or terminal feedback. The two groups (n= 12) were treated to a split-halves-transfer design upon completion of the first test. There were four separate groups: concurrent to concurrent feedback (CC), concurrent to terminal feedback (CT), terminal to concurrent feedback (TC), and <b>terminal</b> <b>to</b> <b>terminal</b> feedback (TT). Seven days transpired between the two tests. From the original sample of 24 participants, 21 completed all testing and were included in the data analysis. The terminal to concurrent feedback group (TC) showed a significant increase in VO 2 max evidenced by the significant test by group interaction (F 3, 17 = 3. 28, p = 0. 047). This finding suggests that using concurrent feedback as a form of motivation can elicit a greater VO 2 max compared with terminal feedback...|$|E
40|$|Field Effect Transistors {{exhibit a}} variety of {{complicated}} dynamic and nonlinear interactions that affect millimetre-wave devices used for telecommunications. The dynamics include self heating, bias dependent change in trapped charge, and variations due to impact ionization. These are feedback mechanisms that contribute to intermodulation as a memory effect does. A FET is better viewed as a nonlinear system with feedback, bias dependent rates, and high-order nonlinear conductance and charge storage with specific <b>terminal</b> <b>to</b> <b>terminal</b> interaction. Identifying and characterizing FET dynamics and linearity is a key step in the design process. Extraction of true intrinsic characteristics is {{an important first step}} to understanding the physics of trapping and heating within the device. Standard measurement techniques tend to derive access networks with an emphasis on scaling with layout geometry. The intrinsic device is then modelled as whatever is left after de-embedding the measurements. As such, the intrinsic model exhibits significant frequency dispersions and behaviour that is not easily related to the operation of the transistor. A correct determination of the access network reveals that the dispersions within the intrinsic data are related to physical process, such as heating and trapping. Recent work has been carried out to accurately implement trapping within a circuit simulator. This is key to correct prediction of intermodulation and bias dependence effects generated by a FET. It is shown that heating significantly affects trapping and {{is an important factor in}} the transient rate dependence of the characteristics. The implementation of trapping within a circuit model, and its consequences on linearity are explored. 11 page(s...|$|E
