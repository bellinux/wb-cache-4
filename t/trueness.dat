And lastly, because, from causes which we can partly understand, the amount of variation has been extraordinarily great. The details will often be tediously minute; but no one who really wants to understand the progress of change in domestic animals, and especially no one who has kept pigeons and has marked the great difference between the breeds and the <b>trueness</b> with which most of them propagate their kind, will doubt that this minuteness is worth while. Notwithstanding the clear evidence that all the breeds are the descendants of a single species, I could not persuade myself until some years had passed that the whole amount of difference between them, had arisen since man first domesticated the wild rock-pigeon.|$|E

All the pity died away; and in its stead came a grim, hard look which boded ill for whoever had been the cause of this mighty downfall. This look in turn gave place to one of decision; the volcanic energy of the man was working to some definite purpose. He glanced around at us; and as his eyes lighted on Nurse Kennedy his eyebrows went up a trifle. She noted the look, and glanced interrogatively at Miss Trelawny, who flashed back a reply with a glance. She went quietly from the room, closing the door behind her.

By {{the middle of the}} 1920s, through the influence of Nevinson, of the critic, Clive Bell, and of the authors of articles in The Arts magazine, he had thoroughly revised his opinions. Nevinson showed that cubism was not a gimmick, but a technique that emerged naturally from the art of its time. Bell articulated a formalist aesthetic that coincided with Gallatin's belief that art was not good because of its realism, but because the two-dimensional space of the painting, drawing, or print possessed a satisfying composition, line, shape, color, and texture. Pictorial representation, <b>trueness</b> to life, and the illusion of depth were secondary concerns. Bell also voiced an opinion that seems to have been latent in Gallatin's thought as well: good art is well-ordered rather than chaotic and it proceeds from the artist's thought processes and intuitive sense of rightness more than his emotions.

The models were digitized with an industrial scanner (IScan D 104 I®) used as a reference, and with four intraoral scanners (Trios®; CS 3500 ®; Zfx Intrascan®; Planscan®). Five scans were taken for each model, using each different intraoral scanner.

General <b>trueness</b> and precision of any scanner were compared by model type, through an ANOVA model including scanner, model and their interaction. Finally, the distance and angles between simulated implants were measured in each group, and compared to those of the reference model, to evaluate local <b>trueness.</b> In the partially edentulous maxilla, CS 3500 ® had the best general <b>trueness</b> (47. 8 μm) and precision (40. 8 μm), followed by Trios® (<b>trueness</b> 71. 2 μm, precision 51. 0 μm), Zfx Intrascan® (<b>trueness</b> 117. 0 μm, precision 126. 2 μm), and Planscan® (<b>trueness</b> 233. 4 μm, precision 219. 8 μm).

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM Milling is {{a central}} and {{important}} aspect of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology. High milling accuracy reduces {{the time needed to}} adapt the workpiece and provides restorations with better longevity and esthetic appeal. The influence of different milling processes on the accuracy of milled restorations has not yet been reviewed. PURPOSE The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the influence of different milling processes on the accuracy of ceramic restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS Four groups of partial crowns were milled (each n= 17) : Three groups in a 4 -axial milling unit: (1) 1 -step mode and Step Bur 12 S (12 S), (2) 1 -step mode and Step Bur 12 (1 Step), (3) 2 -step mode and Step Bur 12 (2 Step), and (4) one group in a 5 -axial milling unit (5 axis). The milled occlusal and inner surfaces were scanned and superimposed over the digital data sets of calculated restorations with specialized difference analysis software. The <b>trueness</b> of each restoration and each group was measured. One-way ANOVA with a post hoc Tukey test was used to compare the data (α=. 05). RESULTS The highest <b>trueness</b> for the inner surface was achieved in group 5 axis (<b>trueness,</b> 41 ± 15 μm, P<. 05). The 4 -axial milling unit exhibited <b>trueness</b> at settings ranging from 61 μm (2 Step) to 96 μm (12 S). For the occlusal surface, the highest <b>trueness</b> was achieved with group 5 axis (<b>trueness,</b> 42 ± 10 μm). The 4 -axial milling unit exhibited <b>trueness</b> at settings ranging from 55 μm (1 Step) to 76 μm (12 S). CONCLUSIONS Restorations milled with a 5 -axial milling unit have a higher <b>trueness</b> than those milled with a 4 -axial milling unit.
