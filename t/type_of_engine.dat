5|$|The P.1127/Kestrel was an {{experimental}} V/STOL aircraft, {{which served as}} the forerunner {{for the production of}} the Hawker Siddeley Harrier and the wider Harrier Jump Jet family. It served to demonstrate an entirely original technique of flight, as well as to trial a brand new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> {{in the form of the}} Pegasus turbofan engine. Despite this, the aircraft employed a principally conventional structure which, according to Mason, lent itself favourably to performing the intended ground attack operations envisioned for production aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{ambulances}} {{are typically}} powered by internal combustion engines, {{which can be}} powered by any conventional fuel, including diesel, gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas, depending on the preference of the operator {{and the availability of}} different options. Colder regions often use gasoline-powered engines, as diesels can be difficult to start when they are cold. Warmer regions may favor diesel engines, as they are thought to be more efficient and more durable. Diesel power is sometimes chosen due to safety concerns, after a series of fires involving gasoline-powered ambulances during the 1980s. These fires were ultimately attributed in part to gasoline's higher volatility in comparison to diesel fuel. The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> may be determined by the manufacturer: in the past two decades, Ford would only sell vehicles for ambulance conversion if they are diesel-powered. Beginning in 2010, Ford will sell its ambulance chassis with a gasoline engine in order to meet emissions requirements.|$|E
25|$|The new gear {{had several}} {{advantages}} over all mechanical gears: {{the rate of}} fire was greatly improved, the synchronization was much more accurate, and above all it was readily adaptable to any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> and airframe, instead of needing a specially designed impulse generator for each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> and special linkages {{for each type of}} aircraft. In the long run (provided it was properly maintained and adjusted) it also proved far more durable and less prone to failure.|$|E

25|$|The {{crosshead}} engine, {{also known}} as a square, sawmill or A-frame engine, was a type of paddlewheel engine used in the United States. It was the most common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> {{in the early years of}} American steam navigation.|$|E
25|$|The {{displacer}} is a special-purpose piston, used in Beta and Gamma type Stirling engines, to {{move the}} working gas {{back and forth between}} the hot and cold heat exchangers. Depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> design, the displacer may or may not be sealed to the cylinder, i.e. it may be a loose fit within the cylinder, allowing the working gas to pass around it as it moves to occupy the part of the cylinder beyond.|$|E

25|$|While {{the higher}} {{pressure}} {{was necessary for}} the compound engine to fully utilize its greater efficiency, it {{may account for the}} fact that this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> remained unpopular in marine applications long after its invention, as boiler explosions were not uncommon on early steamboats and higher pressures made for more violent explosions. After Henry Eckford, Allaire would go on to install several more steamboats with compound engines, decades before the technology was to achieve widespread acceptance in marine applications.|$|E
25|$|The ideal Stirling {{cycle is}} {{unattainable}} {{in the real}} world (as with any heat engine); efficiencies of 50% have been reached, similar to the maximum figure for Diesel cycle engines. The efficiency of Stirling machines is also linked to the environmental temperature; higher efficiency is obtained when the weather is cooler, thus making this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> less interesting in places with warmer climates. As with other external combustion engines, Stirling engines can use heat sources other than from combustion of fuels.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{cylinder}} was placed above the crankshaft in this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>engine,</b> {{it had a}} high center of gravity and was therefore deemed unsuitable for oceangoing service, so that its use was largely confined to vessels plying inland waterways. As marine engines grew steadily larger and heavier {{through the course of}} the century, the high center of gravity of square crosshead engines became increasingly impractical, leading to their abandonment by the 1840s in favor of the walking beam engine.|$|E

25|$|An alpha Stirling {{contains}} two power pistons in separate cylinders, one hot and one cold. The hot cylinder is situated inside the high temperature heat exchanger {{and the cold}} cylinder is situated inside the low temperature heat exchanger. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> has a high power-to-volume ratio but has technical problems because of the usually high temperature of the hot piston and the durability of its seals. In practice, this piston usually carries a large insulating head to move the seals away from the hot zone {{at the expense of}} some additional dead space. The crank angle has a major effect on efficiency and the best angle frequently has to be found experimentally. An angle of 90° frequently locks.|$|E
25|$|Stirling engines {{have a high}} {{efficiency}} compared to steam engines, being able to reach 50% efficiency. They are also capable of quiet operation and can use almost any heat source. The heat energy source is generated external to the Stirling engine rather than by internal combustion as with the Otto cycle or Diesel cycle engines. Because the Stirling engine is compatible with alternative and renewable energy sources it could become increasingly significant {{as the price of}} conventional fuels rises, and also in light of concerns such as depletion of oil supplies and climate change. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> is currently generating interest as the core component of micro combined heat and power (CHP) units, in which it is more efficient and safer than a comparable steam engine. However, it has a low power-to-weight ratio, rendering it more suitable for use in static installations where space and weight are not at a premium.|$|E
500|$|At the time, Frost was {{particularly}} interested in jet engine design and {{ways to improve the}} efficiency of the compressor without sacrificing the simplicity of the turbine engine. He found Frank Whittle's [...] "reverse flow" [...] design too complex and was interested in ways to clean up the layout. This led him to design a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> layout with the flame cans lying directly outside the outer rim of the centrifugal compressor, pointed outwards like the spokes on a wheel. Power for the compressor was drawn from a new type of turbine similar to a centrifugal fan, as opposed to the more typical pinwheel-like design of conventional engines. The turbine drove the compressor using gearing, rather than a shaft. The resulting engine was arranged {{in the form of a}} large disk, which he referred to as a [...] "pancake engine." [...] The jet thrust exited from around the entire rim of the engine, and this presented problems trying to adapt the design to a typical aircraft.|$|E
