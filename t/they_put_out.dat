5|$|The figure {{arrives at}} Valestra's house but finds the gangster dead by Joker's hands. Joker has {{strapped}} a camera to Valestra's corpse {{and sees the}} murderer is not Batman. The figure escapes as the house explodes. Batman pursues the killer, but is interrupted {{by the police and}} rescued from arrest by Andrea. Andrea later explains that she and her father had been hiding in Europe from Valestra's mob, from whom he had embezzled money; her father repaid, but <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> a hit on him. Bruce now believes her father is the killer. Bruce ponders resuming his relationship with Andrea and giving up Batman. He notices a familiar-looking man in the background of the photo of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont: the man who would become the Joker. Joker visits Reeves and presses him for information; Reeves insists that Batman is the cloaked killer. He professes his ignorance but Joker believes Reeves needs to protect his reputation and poisons him. Reeves is taken to the hospital where Batman later breaks in and interrogates him. Reeves confesses he helped the Beaumonts escape and told Valestra's mob their location.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey {{accepted}} Burchard's {{appointment in}} December 1189, but then excommunicated Burchard in January 1190. The excommunication, which was shared with Henry Marshal, was retaliation for {{a dispute with}} the archbishop-elect that happened during a church service. The actual dispute occurred on 5 January 1190 when Burchard and Marshal were conducting vespers, either early or on time, depending on whose side was telling the story. Geoffrey appeared {{in the middle of}} their service and attempted to perform the same service, either late or on time, again depending on who was relating the story. When Burchard and Marshal finished their service, <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> all the lights in the church, leaving the archbishop in the dark. Despite that, he finished the service but then complained to the cathedral chapter of York about the incident. Attempts to mediate a dispute led nowhere, and the citizens of York soon became involved. Geoffrey attempted to keep the townspeople from abusing his two opponents, but Burchard was eventually forced to take refuge in the tomb of William of York, an earlier Archbishop of York. Hugh du Puiset then intervened with the king, and Geoffrey once more lost the royal favour. The king sent Burchard to Rome, along with Reginald fitzJocelin the Bishop of Bath, to attempt to secure the deposition of Geoffrey from York. Although Burchard's efforts in Rome in mid-1190 contributed to a papal prohibition on Geoffrey's consecration by Pope Clement III, Geoffrey was not deposed. Burchard did secure his own absolution of the excommunication placed by Geoffrey in January.|$|E

Cleveland police made 72 arrests for public intoxication, which they said was about usual for a Friday night. There were far fewer fires set the night of July 22–23 (only 14), and only a few false alarms. Cleveland fire investigators determined that none of the fires had been caused by a firebomb, and no firefighters were harassed as <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> blazes.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} things to take into consideration when either trying to lose or put on weight is output versus input. It is important to know the amount of energy your body is using every day, so that your intake fits the needs of one's personal weight goal. Someone wanting to lose weight would want a smaller energy intake than what <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>out.</b> There is increasing research-based evidence that low-fat vegetarian diets consistently lead to healthy weight loss and management, a decrease in diabetic symptoms as well as improved cardiac health.|$|E

25|$|Stevenson, Alvarez, and Egerton {{start a new}} band, All, with singer Dave Smalley. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> {{the album}} Allroy Sez and EP Allroy for Prez in 1988, but their {{constant}} touring schedule proves too much for Smalley, who soon quits. They replace him with Scott Reynolds and release Allroy's Revenge (1989), but have difficulty finding an audience without the recognizable Descendents name and frontman. Seeking a more affordable cost of living and centralized location from which to tour, All relocates to Brookfield, Missouri in 1990. Reynolds quits the band following 1992's Percolater album. With new singer Chad Price All releases 1993's Breaking Things. Signing to a major record label, they relocate to Fort Collins, Colorado and build their own recording studio, The Blasting Room. Their lone major label album is 1995's Pummel.|$|E

[...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau opined: [...] "In short, you'd hardly know the group's conceptmaster was gone – except that <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> noticeably fewer ideas."

500|$|... "The Manchester Rambler", {{written in}} 1932 {{not long after}} the Kinder {{trespass}} and inspired by that event, was Ewan MacColl's first important song, according to Harker, who argues that it [...] "marks a departure from the [...] leaden-footed and slogan-heavy juvenilia". It is also the first song that still survives for which he wrote the melody as well as the lyrics. Its swinging, jaunty melody demonstrates MacColl's ability to combine musical forms and popular rhythms to create a song which is at once familiar and unique. Like the melody, the lyrics are witty and playful. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> a defiant political message with [...] "I may be a wage slave on Monday / But I am a free man on Sunday". MacColl plays with and updates traditional English folksong phraseology with [...] "I once loved a maid, a spot-welder by trade / She was fair as the Rowan in bloom". The lyrics are suitably comical on the confrontation between the ramblers and the gamekeepers in the style of musical theatre, argues Harker, with lines such as [...] "He called me a louse and said 'Think of the grouse'". The song has 5 verses, each of 8 lines, and a 4-line chorus.|$|E
