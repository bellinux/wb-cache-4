5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so <b>terrible</b> <b>that</b> some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

25|$|According to Nelson, {{conditions}} at the Virginia prison were so <b>terrible</b> <b>that</b> the warden, an idealistic Quaker from Maine, believed the prisoners, {{many of whom had}} been arrested on trivial charges, would be better clothed and fed if they were released as laborers to private contractors. (He subsequently changed his mind about this and became an opponent of the convict labor system.) Nelson asserts that a steam drill race at the Big Bend Tunnel would have been impossible because railroad records do not indicate a steam drill being used there.|$|E
25|$|For those, such as Nwokolo, {{who escaped}} from Ibadan and Western Nigeria, the {{experience}} was so <b>terrible</b> <b>that</b> twenty-one specialist doctors mainly from Ibadan and Lagos met and resolved to eatablish a University Teaching Hospital in Enugu.

Multiple long planning meetings were held at Nwokolo‟s private residence. Through Dr. Nlogha Okeke plus permanent secretary and chief secretary to the government: chief Onyegbula, approval was rapidly obtained from the military governor: Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu to open a teaching hospital with Enugu General Hospital as base. Ojukwu also approved swift establishment of the faculty of medicine, headed by professor Kodilinye, while Nwokolo became the first {{head of the department}} of medicine and associate dean of medicine at the new medical school.|$|E

25|$|The {{main event}} of the 79th Anniversary Show was the {{highlight}} of a long running feud between the young tecnico Rush and the rudo El <b>Terrible</b> <b>that</b> had been slowly building {{for almost a year}} leading up to the show. The first significant match between the two took place on November 13, 2011, as Rush successfully defended the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship against El Terrible. The following month on December 25, Rush and El Terrible were the two final survivors in a torneo cibernetico match used to determine who would fight for the vacant CMLL World Heavyweight Championship the following week. On January 1, 2012, El Terrible defeated Rush two falls to one to win the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship. In February, Rush was teamed with El Terrible in the 2012 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles ("National Incredible Pairs Tournament"), a tag team tournament where all teams were made up of rivals. Rush and El Terrible eventually made it to the finals of the tournament on March 2, 2012 at Homenaje a Dos Leyendas, where they were defeated by the team of Atlantis and Mr. Niebla. Two days later, Rush successfully defended the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship against El Terrible. Over the summer of 2012 the feud between the two escalated until a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match, between the two was agreed to. In the weeks before the 79th Anniversary Show held their annual 2012 Universal Championship tournament. Since both Rush and El Terrible held CMLL championships they entered the tournament and ended up facing off in the semi-finals of the tournament. El Terrible won the match over Rush, after which El Terrible and his stablemate Rey Bucanero attacked Rush. On September 9, only five days before the anniversary show, Rush defeated Rey Bucanero in a steel cage match to retain the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

500|$|Less {{than two}} weeks after the {{controversial}} game, ESPN The Magazine released an anonymous poll of 100 current MLB players that named Joyce as the best umpire in Major League Baseball. Joyce was named on 53% of ballots, 19 ballots ahead of second-place Tim McClelland. One player was quoted as saying, [...] "The sad thing about the Galarraga game is, Jim Joyce is seriously one of the best umpires around... He always calls it fair, so players love him. Everyone makes mistakes, and it's <b>terrible</b> <b>that</b> this happened to him." [...] Furthermore, the players in this poll overwhelmingly endorsed (86%) Selig's decision not to overturn the call, and were overwhelmingly against (77%) instituting replay for calls on the bases.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were negative. Blockbuster Entertainment {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} five stars, and film critic Leonard Maltin gave it two-and-a-half out of four stars. In their book about science fiction films, writers James Robert Parish and Michael R. Pitts called Laserblast [...] "an stimulating, unpretentious little film {{in the same vein}} as I Was a Teenage Werewolf. Parish and Pitts praised the stop motion {{animation}} and the performance of Cheryl Smith. Laserblast was among several films universally considered <b>terrible</b> <b>that</b> film reviewer Michael Adams watched as part of a book about his quest to find the worst film of all time. However, Adams said he enjoyed watching it on a B movie level. Monthly Film Bulletin said that Laserblast was [...] "Band's first major box-office success on the exploitation circuit". According to Space.com, Laserblast has achieved cult film status. During a 2005 interview, Charles Band called the film [...] "hilarious" [...] and stated [...] "it had its charm" [...] like many films from its time. He also said that the film would have been made differently and would have had less critical reactions had it been produced with a larger budget.|$|E
500|$|John L. Flynn, a Towson University English {{professor}} {{who has written extensively}} about science-fiction film, unfavorably compared Night of the Blood Beast to The Creeping Terror (1964), which was also about an astronaut returning from space with a stowaway alien creature. Although Flynn said it lacked the [...] "epic pretentiousness" [...] of that film, he nevertheless said of Blood Beast: [...] "Corman {{made a career out of}} making cheap knock-offs of popular films, but he seems to be scraping the bottom of the barrel here". The Washington Post writer Tom Shales said [...] "it would be hard to find a worse movie" [...] and that the monster [...] "looks like the San Diego Chicken after having been tarred and feathered". Film critic and historian Steven H. Scheuer said the plot was a good idea but criticized what he called a [...] "sloppy execution". Literary and film critic John Kenneth Muir said he considered the film a failure because the monster [...] "simply could not live up to expectations once revealed". Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars with the entry: [...] "Well directed, but too low budget to succeed." [...] Night of the Blood Beast was among several films universally considered <b>terrible</b> <b>that</b> film reviewer Michael Adams watched as part of a book about his quest to find the worst film of all time. However, Adams said he enjoyed it on a B movie level, calling it [...] "cheap but enjoyable and buoyed by its ideas". John Stanley, who hosted the San Francisco television show Creature Features about science-fiction films, said Night of the Blood Beast deliberately imitated the best scenes from The Thing from Another World. Chris Eggerston of Bloody Disgusting wrote that the alien in the film [...] "looks like a human-sized parrot covered in feces" [...] and ranked it as the fifth worst movie monster of all time. However, he said that the film's idea of an alien impregnating a human being was an [...] "interesting concept," [...] noting that it was reused in Ridley Scott's Alien.|$|E

The most terrible and heart-breaking moment for Mata Hari during the trial occurred when her lover Maslov – by now a deeply embittered man {{as a result of}} losing his eyes in combat – declined to testify for her, telling her he couldn't care less if she were convicted or not.

She had been starved, having lost around 20kg in weight, and had not received water for several days before her death. Peter Openshaw, the prosecutor in Smith's trial, said: [...] "It was as if he deliberately disfigured her, causing her the utmost pain, distress and degradation... The injuries were not the result of one sudden eruption of violence, they must have been caused over a long period [...] were so extensive and so <b>terrible</b> <b>that</b> the defendant must have deliberately and systematically tortured the girl." [...] The cause of death was drowning, immediately prior to which she had been beaten about the head with a shower head. Openshaw said that [...] "Her death must have been a merciful end to her torment".|$|E
2500|$|From the 11th century onwards, {{a series}} of {{powerful}} Berber dynasties arose.

In the 13th and 14th centuries the Merinids held power in Morocco and strove to replicate the successes of the Almohads by military campaigns in Algeria and Spain. They were followed by the Wattasids. In the 15th century, the Reconquista ended Muslim rule in central and southern Spain and many Muslims and Jews fled to Morocco. Portuguese efforts to control the Atlantic coast in the 15th century did not greatly affect the interior of Morocco. According to Elizabeth Allo Isichei, [...] "In 1520, there was a famine in Morocco so <b>terrible</b> <b>that</b> {{for a long time}} other events were dated by it.
