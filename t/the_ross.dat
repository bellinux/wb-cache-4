5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ross</b> {{expedition}} was {{a voyage}} of scientific {{exploration of the}} Antarctic in 1839 to 1843, led by James Clark Ross, with two unusually strong warships, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror.

On the expedition, Ross discovered the Transantarctic Mountains and the volcanoes Erebus and Terror, named after his ships.

5|$|New Zealand {{is one of}} 16 realms {{within the}} Commonwealth. The Realm of New Zealand is the entire area over which the Queen of New Zealand is sovereign, and {{comprises}} New Zealand, Tokelau, <b>the</b> <b>Ross</b> Dependency, the Cook Islands and Niue. The Cook Islands and Niue are self-governing states in free association with New Zealand. The New Zealand Parliament cannot pass legislation for these countries, but with their consent can act on behalf of them in foreign affairs and defence. Tokelau is a non-self-governing territory, but is administered by a council of three elders (one from each Tokelauan atoll). <b>The</b> <b>Ross</b> Dependency is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica, where it operates the Scott Base research facility. New Zealand nationality law treats {{all parts of the}} realm equally, so most people born in New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau and <b>the</b> <b>Ross</b> Dependency are New Zealand citizens.|$|E
5|$|Ross {{established}} the general geography of this region, and named {{many of its}} features; <b>the</b> <b>Ross</b> Sea, the Great Ice Barrier (later renamed <b>the</b> <b>Ross</b> Ice Shelf), Ross Island, Cape Adare, Victoria Land, McMurdo Sound, Cape Crozier and the twin volcanoes Mount Erebus and Mount Terror. He returned to the Barrier several times, hoping to penetrate it, {{but was unable to}} do so, achieving his Farthest South in a small Barrier inlet at 78°10′, in February 1842. Ross suspected that land lay to the east of the Barrier, but was unable to confirm this.|$|E

Organisational and financial problems delayed their start until December 1914, which shortened their first depot-laying season.

5|$|The {{drift of}} the Antarctic {{exploration}} vessel SY Aurora was an ordeal which lasted 312days, during <b>the</b> <b>Ross</b> Sea chapter of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914–17.

5000|$|A feud later {{broke out}} with <b>the</b> Clan <b>Ross</b> whose chiefs were <b>the</b> <b>Rosses</b> of Balnagown Castle. According to the Blackcastle MS (which {{was written by}} Alexander Mackay of Blackcastle who {{had access to the}} Mackay chief’s family {{charters}} and papers) <b>the</b> <b>Rosses</b> had made [...] "a predatory incursion" [...] into the territory of the Mackays. Sir Robert Gordon however says that the Mackays [...] "often molested with incursions and invasions" [...] the lands of <b>the</b> <b>Rosses.</b> According to historian Angus Mackay the evidence is ample that the Mackays managed to recover some of the lands in Ross-shire that had belonged to their relatives and enemies, Neil Neilson Mackay, his brother Morgan Neilson Mackay and Neil and Morgan’s father-in-law Murray of Cubin, all three of whom had been defeated and killed by the Mackays of Strathnaver at the Battle of Drumnacoub in 1433. The evidence is also ample that <b>the</b> <b>Rosses</b> managed to secure some of these lands lying in the parishes of Edderton and Kincardine in Ross-shire. So it appears that the feud between the Mackays and <b>the</b> <b>Rosses</b> arose out of a scramble for disputed lands. Angus Roy Mackay having made various expeditions into Ross was at last overpowered in what is now known as the Battle of Tarbat, and taking refuge in the church of Tarbat which was set on fire, he was burnt to death in 1486.|$|R
5|$|On 10 January 1917, {{manned by}} an almost entirely new crew, Aurora arrived at Cape Evans {{and picked up}} the seven {{survivors}} of <b>the</b> <b>Ross</b> Sea shore party; Mackintosh, Victor Hayward and Arnold Spencer-Smith had all died. This was the vessel's final visit to Antarctic waters; on return to New Zealand it was sold by Shackleton to a coal carrier. Aurora left Newcastle, New South Wales, on 20 June 1917 bound for Chile, and was never seen again, officially posted as missing by Lloyd's of London on 2 January 1918. Among those lost was James Paton, who had acted as the ship's boatswain throughout <b>the</b> <b>Ross</b> Sea Party expedition and the drift, and on the subsequent relief mission. In 1920 King George V appointed Joseph Stenhouse an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), in acknowledgement of his service aboard Aurora.|$|E
