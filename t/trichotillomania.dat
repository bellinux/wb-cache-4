5|$|The {{most common}} form of self-harm is using a sharp object to cut one's skin, but self-harm also covers a wide range of {{behaviours}} including burning, scratching, banging or hitting body parts, interfering with wound healing (dermatillomania), hair-pulling (<b>trichotillomania)</b> and the ingestion of toxic substances or objects. Behaviours associated with substance abuse and eating disorders are usually not considered self-harm because the resulting tissue damage is ordinarily an unintentional side effect. However, the boundaries are not always clearly defined and in some cases behaviours that usually fall outside the boundaries of self-harm may indeed represent self-harm if performed with explicit intent to cause tissue damage. Although suicide is not the intention of self-harm, the relationship between self-harm and suicide is complex, as self-harming behaviour may be potentially life-threatening. There is also an increased risk of suicide in individuals who self-harm and self-harm is found in 40–60% of suicides. However, generalising self-harmers to be suicidal is, in the majority of cases, inaccurate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trichotillomania</b> {{and skin}} picking {{disorder}} {{seem to be}} disorders that primarily involve motor impulsivity, and will likely be classified in the DSM-V within the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders category.|$|E

25|$|Fluoxetine is {{frequently}} {{used to treat}} major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bulimia nervosa, panic disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and <b>trichotillomania.</b> It has also been used for cataplexy, obesity, and alcohol dependence, as well as binge eating disorder. It has also been tried {{as a treatment for}} autism spectrum disorders with moderate success in adults.|$|E
25|$|MAOIs {{have been}} found to be {{effective}} in the treatment of panic disorder with agoraphobia, social phobia, atypical depression or mixed anxiety and depression, bulimia, and post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as borderline personality disorder. MAOIs appear to be particularly effective in the management of bipolar depression according to a recent retrospective-analysis. There are reports of MAOI efficacy in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), <b>trichotillomania,</b> dysmorphophobia, and avoidant personality disorder, but these reports are from uncontrolled case reports.|$|E
25|$|People with OCD may be {{diagnosed}} with other conditions, as well as or instead of OCD, such as the aforementioned obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, anorexia nervosa, social anxiety disorder, bulimia nervosa, Tourette syndrome, Asperger syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dermatillomania (compulsive skin picking), body dysmorphic disorder and <b>trichotillomania</b> (hair pulling). More than 50 percent of people experience suicidal tendencies, and 15 percent have attempted suicide. Depression, anxiety and prior suicide attempts {{increase the risk of}} future suicide attempts.|$|E
25|$|The TCAs {{are used}} {{primarily}} in the clinical treatment of mood disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), dysthymia, and treatment-resistant variants. They are also used {{in the treatment of}} a number of other medical disorders, including anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SP) also known as social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and panic disorder (PD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, certain personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder (BPD), Neurological disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Parkinson's disease as well as chronic pain, neuralgia or neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia, headache, or migraine, smoking cessation, tourette syndrome, <b>trichotillomania,</b> irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), interstitial cystitis (IC), nocturnal enuresis (NE), narcolepsy, insomnia, pathological crying and/or laughing, chronic hiccups, ciguatera poisoning, and as an adjunct in schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{pathological}} gambling, along with fluvoxamine, clomipramine has been shown effective in the treatment, with reducing the problems of pathological gambling in a subject by up to 90%. Whereas in <b>trichotillomania,</b> the use of clomipramine has again {{been found to be}} effective, fluoxetine has not produced consistent positive results. Fluoxetine, however, has produced positive results in the treatment of pathological skin picking disorder, although {{more research is needed to}} conclude this information. Fluoxetine has also been evaluated in treating IED and demonstrated significant improvement in reducing frequency and severity of impulsive aggression and irritability in a sample of 100 subjects who were randomized into a 14-week, double-blind study. Despite a large decrease in impulsive aggression behavior from baseline, only 44% of fluoxetine responders and 29% of all fluoxetine subjects were considered to be in full remission at the end of the study. Paroxetine has shown to be somewhat effective although the results are inconsistent. Another medication, escitalopram, has shown to improve the condition of the subjects of pathological gambling with anxiety symptoms. The results suggest that although SSRIs have shown positive results in the treatment of pathological gambling, inconsistent results with the use of SSRIs have been obtained which might suggest a neurological heterogeneity in the impulse-control disorder spectrum.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Dr. Richard Castillo, as {{quoted by}} Dr. C. George Boeree, {{believes}} that amok (with very similar symptoms to grisi siknis), pibloktoq, latah, [...] "falling out", [...] "indisposition", and the [...] "fits" [...] are all related to impulse control disorders, {{and thus are}} associated with <b>trichotillomania,</b> compulsive gambling, pyromania, and kleptomania in Western medicine.|$|E
2500|$|One clear {{extension}} {{of problems with}} decision-making is drug addiction/substance dependence, which can result from disruption of the striato-thalamo-orbitofrontal circuit. [...] Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has also been implicated in dysfunction of neural reward circuitry controlling motivation, reward, and impulsivity, including OFC systems. [...] Other disorders of executive functioning and impulse control may be affected by OFC circuitry dysregulation, such as obsessive–compulsive disorder and <b>trichotillomania</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Disorders {{characterized}} by impulsivity {{that were not}} categorized elsewhere in the DSM-IV-TR were {{also included in the}} category [...] "Impulse-control disorders not elsewhere classified". <b>Trichotillomania</b> (hair-pulling) and skin-picking were moved in DSM-5 to the obsessive-compulsive chapter. Additionally, other disorders not specifically listed in this category are often classed as impulsivity disorders. Terminology was changed in the DSM-V from [...] "Not Otherwise Classified" [...] to [...] "Not Elsewhere Classified".|$|E
2500|$|A single manic episode, in {{the absence}} of {{secondary}} causes, (i.e., substance use disorder, pharmacologic, general medical condition) is sufficient to diagnose bipolar I disorder. Hypomania may be indicative of bipolar II disorder. [...] Manic episodes are often complicated by delusions and/or hallucinations; should the psychotic features persist for a duration significantly longer than the episode of mania (two weeks or more), a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is more appropriate. Certain of [...] "obsessive-compulsive spectrum" [...] disorders as well as impulse control disorders share the name [...] "mania," [...] namely, kleptomania, pyromania, and <b>trichotillomania.</b> Despite the unfortunate association implied by the name, however, no connection exists between mania or bipolar disorder and these disorders.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} much debate {{over whether or not}} the ICDs deserve a {{diagnostic}} category of their own, or whether they are in fact phenomenologically and epidemiologically related to other major psychiatric conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), affective disorders, and addictive disorders. In fact, the ICD classification is likely to change with the release of the DSM-V in May 2013. [...] In this new revision the ICD NOS will likely be reduced or removed; proposed revisions include reclassifying <b>trichotillomania</b> (to be renamed hair-pulling disorder) and skin picking disorder as obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, moving Intermittent Explosive Disorder under the diagnostic heading of disruptive, impulse control, and conduct disorders, and gambling disorder may be included in addiction and related disorders.|$|E
2500|$|In {{children}} or adolescents, CBT {{is an effective}} part of treatment plans for anxiety disorders, body dysmorphic disorder, depression and suicidality, eating disorders and obesity, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), [...] and posttraumatic stress disorder, as well as tic disorders, <b>trichotillomania,</b> and other repetitive behavior disorders. CBT-SP, an adaptation of CBT for suicide prevention (SP), was specifically designed for treating youths who are severely depressed and who have recently attempted suicide within the past 90 days, and {{was found to be}} effective, feasible, and acceptable. Sparx is a video game to help young persons, using the CBT method to teach them how to resolve their own issues. CBT has also been shown to be effective for posttraumatic stress disorder in very young children (3 to 6 years of age).|$|E
2500|$|Impulse control {{disorder}} (ICDs) are a {{class of}} DSM diagnoses that do not fall into the other diagnostic categories of the manual (e.g. substance use disorders), and that are characterized by extreme difficulty controlling impulses or urges despite negative consequences. [...] Individuals suffering from an impulse control disorder frequently experience five stages of symptoms: compelling urge or desire, failure to resist the urge, {{a heightened sense of}} arousal, succumbing to the urge (which usually yields relief from tension), and potential remorse or feelings of guilt after the behavior is completed. Specific disorders included within this category include intermittent explosive disorder, kleptomania, pathological gambling, pyromania, <b>trichotillomania</b> (hair pulling disorder), and impulse control disorders not otherwise specified (ICD NOS). ICD NOS includes other significant difficulties that seem to be related to impulsivity but do not meet the criteria for a specific DSM diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|Psychopharmacological {{intervention}} in disorders of impulsivity has shown evidence of positive effects; common pharmacological interventions {{include the use}} of stimulant medication, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants. ADHD has a well-established evidence base supporting the use of stimulant medication for the reduction of ADHD symptoms. Pathological gambling has also been studied in drug trials, and there is evidence that gambling is responsive to SSRIs and other antidepressants. [...] Evidence based pharmacological treatment for <b>trichotillomania</b> is not yet available, with mixed results of studies investigating the use of SSRIs, though Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has shown positive effects. Intermittent Explosive Disorder is most often treated with mood stabilizers, SSRIs, beta blockers, alpha agonists, and anti-psychotics (all of which have shown positive effects). There is evidence that some pharmacological interventions are efficacious in treating substance use disorders, though their use can depend on the type substance that is abused. [...] Pharmacological treatments for SUD {{include the use of}} acamprosate, buprenorphine, disulfiram, LAAM, methadone, and naltrexone.|$|E

50|$|Abnormalities in the caudate nucleus {{are noted}} in OCD, {{but there is}} no {{evidence}} to support that these abnormalities can also be linked to <b>trichotillomania.</b> One study has shown that individuals with <b>trichotillomania</b> have decreased cerebellar volume.

50|$|<b>Trichotillomania</b> is {{an impulse}} control {{disorder}} which causes {{an individual to}} pull out their hair from various parts of their body without a purpose. The cause for <b>trichotillomania</b> remains unknown. Like OCD <b>trichotillomania</b> isn’t a nervous condition but stress can trigger this habit. For some people pulling their hair out of boredom is normal, but that isn’t the case for someone that is dealing with <b>trichotillomania.</b> Emotions do not affect the behavior but these behaviors are more prevalent in those that suffer with depression.|$|E
50|$|Anxiety, {{depression}} and obsessive-compulsive disorder are more frequently encountered {{in people with}} <b>trichotillomania.</b> <b>Trichotillomania</b> has a high overlap with post traumatic stress disorder, and some cases of <b>trichotillomania</b> may be triggered by stress. Another school of thought emphasizes hair pulling as addictive or negatively reinforcing, as it is associated with rising tension beforehand and relief afterward. A neurocognitive model — {{the notion that the}} basal ganglia plays a role in habit formation and that the frontal lobes are critical for normally suppressing or inhibiting such habits — sees <b>trichotillomania</b> as a habit disorder.|$|E
50|$|The {{inability}} {{to control the}} urge to pick {{is similar to the}} urge to compulsively pull one's own hair, i.e., <b>trichotillomania.</b> Researchers have noted the following similarities between <b>trichotillomania</b> and excoriation disorder: the symptoms are ritualistic but there are no preceding obsessions; there are similar triggers for the compulsive actions; both conditions appear {{to play a role in}} modifying the arousal level of the subject; and the age of onset for both conditions is similar. There is also a high level of comorbidity between those that have <b>trichotillomania</b> and those that have excoriation disorder. A notable difference between these conditions is that skin picking seems to be dominated by females whereas <b>trichotillomania</b> is more evenly distributed across genders.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trichotillomania</b> is {{classified}} as compulsive picking of hair of the body. It can be from any place on the body that has hair. This picking results in bald spots. Most people who have mild <b>Trichotillomania</b> can overcome it via concentration and more self-awareness.|$|E
50|$|Trichophagia (τριχοφαγία, from τρίχα, tricha “hair” + φάγειν, phagein “to eat”) is the {{compulsive}} eating of hair {{associated with}} <b>trichotillomania</b> (hair pulling). In trichophagia, people with <b>trichotillomania</b> also ingest the hair that they pull; in extreme (and rare) cases this {{can lead to}} a hair ball (trichobezoar).|$|E
50|$|Although no broad-based {{population}} epidemiologic {{studies had}} been conducted as of 2009, the lifetime prevalence of <b>trichotillomania</b> {{is estimated to}} be between 0.6% and 4.0% of the overall population.

5000|$|People {{who suffer}} from <b>trichotillomania</b> often pull only one hair {{at a time and}} these hair-pulling episodes can last for hours at a time. <b>Trichotillomania</b> can go into remission-like states where the {{individual}} may not experience the urge to [...] "pull" [...] for days, weeks, months, and even years.|$|E

These conditions may share clinical features, genetic contributions, and possibly treatment response; however, differences between <b>trichotillomania</b> and OCD are present in symptoms, neural function and cognitive profile. [...] In {{the sense that it}} is associated with irresistible urges to perform unwanted repetitive behavior, <b>trichotillomania</b> is akin to some of these conditions, and rates of <b>trichotillomania</b> among relatives of OCD patients is higher than expected by chance. [...] However, differences between the disorder and OCD have been noted, including: differing peak ages at onset, rates of comorbidity, gender differences, and neural dysfunction and cognitive profile. [...] When it occurs in early childhood, it can be regarded as a distinct clinical entity.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Trichotillomania</b> {{is defined}} as a {{self-induced}} and recurrent loss of hair. [...] It includes the criterion of an increasing sense of tension before pulling the hair and gratification or relief when pulling the hair. [...] However, some people with <b>trichotillomania</b> do not endorse the inclusion of [...] "rising tension and subsequent pleasure, gratification, or relief" [...] as part of the criteria; [...] because many individuals with <b>trichotillomania</b> may not realize they are pulling their hair, patients presenting for diagnosis may deny the criteria for tension prior to hair pulling or a sense of gratification after hair is pulled.|$|E
