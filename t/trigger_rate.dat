50|$|The {{signal from}} the {{detector}} is transmitted over 162 m long optical fibers. The signal is digitized and stored in 32kB ring buffer. The readout of the ring buffer results in a dead time 20 µs, which corresponds to about 2% dead time at the design <b>trigger</b> <b>rate</b> of 1 kHz. The readout is controlled by an FPGA (Xilinx) chip on a PCI (MicroEnable) card.

In the real world, this would equate to a 220 mA-hr CR2032 coin cell battery lasting for close to 20 years. This same application could be implemented with LESENSE and preset thresholds, instead of using regular time interval ADC samples. In the case of LESENSE and irregular triggers, a threshold <b>trigger</b> <b>rate</b> of 1 Hz would still produce average current of 1.5 uA, which equates to 16.85-year battery life.|$|E
40|$|At the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, {{an average}} of 17. 3 inelastic {{interactions}} will occur per beam crossing at design luminosity. Muon <b>trigger</b> <b>rates</b> {{in the presence of}} this pile-up can be simulated in two different ways. Firstly, the trigger response can be simulated for single interactions and the effect of piling up such interactions can then be taken into account, analytically. Secondly, interactions can be superimposed in order to construct beam crossings as they will occur at the LHC and the trigger response can be simulated for these beam crossings. The application of the first method to singleömuon and diömuon <b>trigger</b> <b>rates</b> is discussed. The obtained rates are exact but interference effects of particles from multiple interactions contributing to the same trigger object are neglected. The second method includes these interference effects, explicitly. It can be used to study any ty pe of trigger condition, including topological multi-object triggers. If crossings were constructed from completely unbiased minimum bias events, an excessive number of events would be required to obtain accurate <b>trigger</b> <b>rates.</b> A technique to pile up interactions that are generated in bins of muon transverse momentum therefore has been developed which allows to obtain accurate <b>trigger</b> <b>rates</b> up to high trigger thresholds with much smaller datasets.

5000|$|A {{disadvantage}} of digital oscilloscopes is the limited refresh {{rate of the}} screen. On an analog oscilloscope, the user can get an intuitive sense of the <b>trigger</b> <b>rate</b> simply {{by looking at the}} steadiness of the CRT trace. For a digital oscilloscope, the screen looks exactly the same for any signal rate which exceeds the screen's refresh rate. Additionally, it is sometimes difficult to spot [...] "glitches" [...] or other rare phenomena on the black-and-white screens of standard digital oscilloscopes; the slight persistence of CRT phosphors on analog oscilloscopes makes glitches visible even if many subsequent triggers overwrite them. Both of these difficulties have been overcome recently by [...] "digital phosphor oscilloscopes", which store data at a very high refresh rate and display it with variable intensity, to simulate the trace persistence of a CRT oscilloscope.|$|E
5000|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{a trigger}} {{is a system}} that uses criteria to rapidly decide which events in a particle detector to keep when {{only a small fraction of}} the total can be recorded. Trigger systems are necessary due to real-world limitations in computing power, data storage capacity and rates. Since experiments are typically searching for [...] "interesting" [...] events (such as decays of rare particles) that occur at a relatively low rate, trigger systems are used to identify the events that should be recorded for later analysis. Current accelerators have event rates greater than 1 MHz and trigger rates that can be below 10 Hz. The ratio of the <b>trigger</b> <b>rate</b> to the event rate is referred to as the selectivity of the trigger. For example, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has an event rate of 40 MHz (4·107 Hz), and the Higgs boson is expected to be produced there at a rate of roughly 1 Hz. The LHC detectors can manage to permanently store a few hundred events per second. Therefore the minimum selectivity required is 10−5, with much stricter requirements for the data analysis afterwards.|$|E

40|$|The {{acoustic}} emission activity {{associated with}} recent rock fracture experiments under different conditions {{has indicated that}} some features of event-event triggering are independent {{of the details of}} the experiment and the materials used and are often even indistinguishable from tectonic earthquakes. While the event-event <b>triggering</b> <b>rates</b> or aftershock rates behave pretty much identical for all rock fracture experiments at short times, {{this is not the case}} for later times. Here, we discuss how these differences can be a consequence of the aftershock identification method used and show that the true aftershock rates might have two distinct regimes. Specifically, tests on a modified Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence model show that the model rates cannot be correctly inferred at late times based on temporal information only if the activity rates or the branching ratio are high. We also discuss both the effect of the two distinct regimes in the aftershock rates and the effect of the background rate on the inter-event time distribution.
