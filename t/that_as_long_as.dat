5|$|British {{architect}} Frederick Gibberd {{published a}} diagrammatic comparison of Durham Cathedral alongside a power station {{typical of the}} design of the time, like the one planned at Kepier. This made clear that, although the Cathedral was {{one of the largest in}} the country, it still would looked small next to the projected power station. It was argued <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> the two structures were viewed simultaneously, the visual juxtaposition would be detrimental to the Cathedral. Somewhat ironically, Gibberd's Didcot Power Station would later be voted the third worst eyesore in Britain in 2003.|$|E

5|$|The local legend {{suggests}} that the Cailleach and her family were given shelter in the glen by the locals and while they stayed there the glen was always fertile and prosperous.

5|$|In the Norwegian Government's {{internal}} evaluation, FFI stated <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> regular inspections {{were carried}} out, {{there was little}} chance of military use of the installations, in particular because of the limited technical equipment which would be installed. The Norwegian Intelligence Service held a different opinion, and stated that if the right equipment was installed, the ground station {{could be used to}} listen to information from Soviet satellites in the area and that it would require a very competent inspector to find such equipment. Allowing Soviet inspectors access to the station was discussed politically, but this was quickly discarded as it would establish an unwanted precedent and would undermine the Norwegian sovereignty of the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Babcock's {{first move}} as GM was {{drafting}} centre Rafael Araújo—selected eighth overall—in the 2004 NBA draft, {{in a move}} that was criticized by fans and analysts, considering highly touted swingman Andre Iguodala was drafted with the next pick. Babcock signed point guard Rafer Alston to a five-year deal. After Vince Carter's annual charity game, Babcock implicitly revealed to the media that Carter's agent had asked for a trade, confirming Carter's discontent. The Toronto Sun reported that Carter felt he was being misled by the Raptors' hierarchy during the General Manager search and had concluded <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> the managerial structure at Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd. remained intact, the Raptors would never be an elite team. Carter was finally traded mid-season, ending his six-year tenure. Toronto received Alonzo Mourning, forwards Eric Williams and Aaron Williams and two mid-to-late future first round picks from the New Jersey Nets. Mourning chose not to report to Toronto, forcing Babcock to buy out the remainder of his contract at a reported $10million, leaving him free to sign with the Miami Heat. Eric and Aaron Williams were supposed to add defensive toughness and rebounding, but were generally under-utilized for the entire season. Analysts had predicted Babcock got the bad end of the deal, and the trade eventually cost him his job.|$|E

5|$|During the {{following}} weeks, while Belisarius remained in Carthage strengthening its walls, Gelimer established {{himself and the}} remnant of his army at Bulla Regia. By distributing money {{he had managed to}} cement the loyalty of the locals to his cause, and sent messages recalling Tzazon and his men from Sardinia, where they had been successful in re-establishing Vandal authority and killing Godas. While waiting for Tzazon's arrival, the Vandal king's army also increased by the arrival of more and more fugitives from the battle of Ad Decimum, as well as by a contingent of his Moorish allies. Most of the Moorish tribes of Numidia and Byzacena, however, sent embassies to Belisarius, pledging allegiance to the Empire. Some even offered hostages and asked for the insignia of office traditionally awarded to them by the emperor: a gilded silver staff and a silver crown, a white cloak, a white tunic, and a gilded boot. Belisarius had been furnished by Justinian with these items in anticipation of this demand, and duly dispatched them along with sums of money. Nevertheless, it was clear <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> the outcome of the war remained undecided, neither side could count on the firm loyalty of the Moors. During this period, messengers from Tzazon, sent to announce his recovery of Sardinia, sailed into Carthage unaware that the city had fallen and were taken captive, followed shortly after by Gelimer's envoys to Theudis, who had reached Spain after the news of the Roman successes had arrived there and hence failed to secure an alliance. Belisarius was also reinforced by the Roman general Cyril with his contingent, who had sailed to Sardinia only to find it once again in possession of the Vandals.|$|E
5|$|Jacques {{joined the}} Quebec Citadelles in 1947. It was while {{playing for the}} Citadelles that Plante started to play the puck outside his crease. He {{developed}} this technique when he recognized that the team's defense was performing poorly. Fans found Plante's unconventional playing style to be exciting, but it angered his managers. They believed that a goaltender should stay in net and let his players recover the puck. Plante {{had come to the}} conclusion <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> he was in control of the puck, the opponents could not shoot it at him – this is now standard practice for goaltenders. The same season, the Citadelles beat the Montreal Junior Canadiens in the league finals, with Plante being named most valuable player on his team. The Montreal Canadiens' general manager, Frank J. Selke, became interested in acquiring Plante {{as a member of the}} team. In 1948, Plante received an invitation to the Canadiens' training camp. On August 17, 1949, Selke offered Plante a contract with the Canadiens' organization. Plante played for Montreal's affiliate Royal Montreal Hockey Club, earning $4,500 for the season, and an extra $500 for practicing with the Canadiens.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{falls into}} the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus; {{the souls of the}} Underworld weaken him and ruin the Blades of Athena. Climbing from the river, he is confronted by the spirit of Athena, who had {{previously}} sacrificed herself to save Zeus from Kratos. She tells Kratos that her sacrifice has brought her to a higher existence, and she now sees truths she did not see before. She states <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> Zeus reigns, there is no hope for mankind. She gives him the Blades of Exile and says that to kill Zeus, he must quench the Flame of Olympus. After finding the three Judges of the Underworld and the Chain of Balance, Kratos encounters the spirit of Pandora, whom he mistakes for his dead daughter, Calliope. Refusing to help the child, he continues his quest. After encountering the Olympian blacksmith Hephaestus and recovering the Blade of Olympus, he kills Hades, which releases the souls of the Underworld. When he considers searching for the soul of Calliope, Athena reminds Kratos of his quest, and he leaves the Underworld, arriving at Olympia. There he finds the wounded Gaia, who calls for help. He severs her arm, causing her to fall from Mount Olympus to her apparent death.|$|E

5|$|On 19 August 1561, cannons {{were fired}} in Leith to {{announce}} Queen Mary's arrival in Scotland. When she attended Mass being {{celebrated in the}} royal chapel at Holyrood Palace five days later, this prompted a protest in which one of her servants was jostled. The next day she issued a proclamation {{that there would be}} no alteration in the current state of religion and that her servants should not be molested or troubled. Many nobles accepted this, but not Knox. The following Sunday, he protested from the pulpit of St Giles'. As a result, just two weeks after her return, Mary summoned Knox. She accused him of inciting a rebellion against her mother and of writing a book against her own authority. Knox answered <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> her subjects found her rule convenient, he was willing to accept her governance, noting that Paul the Apostle had been willing to live under Nero's rule. Mary noted, however, that he had written against the principle of female rule itself. He responded that she should not to be troubled by what had never harmed her. When Mary asked him whether subjects had a right to resist their ruler, he replied that if monarchs exceeded their lawful limits, they might be resisted, even by force.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the marathon, all the {{entrants}} of {{the race}} except for the Finns, whose positions were known, filed a petition asking Nurmi's entry to be accepted. Edström's right-hand man Bo Ekelund, secretary general of the IAAF and head of the Swedish Athletics Federation, approached the Finnish officials and stated that {{he might be able to}} arrange for Nurmi to participate in the marathon outside the competition. However, Finland maintained <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> the athlete is not declared a professional, he must have the right to participate in the race officially. Although he had been diagnosed with a pulled Achilles tendon two weeks earlier, Nurmi stated he would have won the event by five minutes. The congress concluded without Nurmi being declared a professional, but the council's authority to disbar an athlete was upheld on a 13–12 vote. However, due to the close vote, the matter was postponed until the 1934 meet in Stockholm. Finns charged that the Swedish officials had used devious tricks in their campaign against Nurmi's amateur status, and ceased all athletic relations with Sweden. A year earlier, controversies on the track and in the press had led Finland to withdraw from the Finland-Sweden athletics international. After Nurmi's suspension, Finland did not agree to return to the event until 1939.|$|E
