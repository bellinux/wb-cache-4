500|$|In an {{oral history}} interview, Singh {{said that one}} of the murder trials that he had presided over, the [...] "Body in the Box" [...] case, led to the {{abolition}} of jury trials in Singapore criminal cases. Following the trial of a young man, Freddy Tan, for the murder of his friend whose decomposed body was found stuffed into a box, Singh agreed with the jury to convict Tan of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and sentence him to life imprisonment. However, he later learnt that in <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>room</b> a bullying Dutch juror had wanted to impose the death penalty, but because the other jurors disliked his attitude they voted to impose a lower verdict on Tan. The father of the deceased felt an injustice had been done and went to see the Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew. Lee then sent for Singh, and Singh informed him of what had happened with the jurors. Lee asked Singh, [...] "Well what do you think. Shall I abolish the jury?" [...] Singh replied that if he had tried Tan without a jury, he would have convicted him of murder without hesitation. Following a public inquiry, jury trials were abolished for all criminal cases in 1969.|$|E

In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous.

2500|$|<b>The</b> grand <b>jury</b> is a pre-{{constitutional}} {{common law}} institution, and a constitutional fixture {{in its own}} right exclusively embracing common law. The process applies to the states {{to the extent that the}} states have incorporated grand juries and/or common law. Most states have an alternative civil process. [...] "Although state systems of criminal procedure differ greatly among themselves, <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> is similarly guaranteed by many state constitutions and plays an important role in fair and effective law enforcement in the overwhelming [...] majority of the States." [...] Branzburg v. Hayes (No. 70-85) 1972. Grand juries, which return indictments in many criminal cases, are composed of a jury of peers and operate in closed deliberation proceedings; they are given specific instructions regarding the law by the judge. Many constitutional restrictions that apply in court or in other situations do not apply during grand jury proceedings. For example, the exclusionary rule does not apply to certain evidence presented to a grand jury; the exclusionary rule states that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth, Fifth or Sixth amendments cannot be introduced in court. Also, an individual does not have the right to have an attorney present in <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> <b>room</b> during hearings. An individual would have such a right during questioning by the police while in custody, but an individual testifying before a grand jury is free to leave <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> <b>room</b> to consult with his attorney outside the room before returning to answer a question.|$|R
