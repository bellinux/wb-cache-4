40|$|The micro-EDM is a {{well-established}} subtractive type of micro-manufacturing process {{and has been}} at the center of research for the last 15 years. The laser induced plasma micro-machining (LIP-MM) is a novel multimaterial and tool-less micro-machining process that also removes material through plasma. Since, both processes remove material through melting and vaporization, machining is always accompanied with heat affected zone. Since different materials have different thermo-physical properties, the plasma discharge energy level for minimal HAZ is material-dependent. The plasma discharge energy level corresponding to minimal HAZ can be experimentally determined by examining the dependence of the spatial distribution of the <b>transient</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>response</b> near the machined zone on the energy level. This paper, for the first time, presents an experimental investigation on real time measurement of the <b>transient</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>response</b> during single discharge machining at different pulse energy levels by the micro-EDM and the LIP-MM processes. The experimental data establishes a relationship between the pulse energy level and the <b>transient</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>response</b> and thus can be used for identifying the conditions for minimal HAZ in the two processes...|$|E

40|$|The {{responses}} of isoprene emission rate to temperature {{are characterized by}} complex time-dependent behaviors that are currently not entirely understood. To gain insight into the temperature dependencies of isoprene emission, we studied steady-state and transient {{responses of}} isoprene emission from hybrid aspen (Populus tremula × Populus tremuloides) leaves using a fast-response gas-exchange system coupled to a proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometer. A method based on postillumination isoprene release after rapid <b>temperature</b> <b>transients</b> was developed to determine the rate constant of isoprene synthase (IspS), the pool size of its substrate dimethylallyldiphosphate (DMADP), and to separate the component processes of the temperature dependence of isoprene emission. <b>Temperature</b> <b>transients</b> indicated that over the temperature range 25 °C to 45 °C, IspS was thermally stable and operated in the linear range of its substrate DMADP concentration. The in vivo rate constant of IspS obeyed the Arrhenius law, with an activation energy of 42. 8 kJ mol− 1. In contrast, steady-state isoprene emission had a significantly lower temperature optimum than IspS and higher activation energy. The reversible temperature-dependent decrease {{in the rate of}} isoprene emission between 35 °C and 44 °C was caused by decreases in DMADP concentration, possibly reflecting reduced pools of energetic metabolites generated in photosynthesis, particularly of ATP. Strong control of isoprene <b>temperature</b> <b>responses</b> by the DMADP pool implies that <b>transient</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>responses</b> under fluctuating conditions in the field are driven by initial DMADP pool size as well as temperature-dependent modifications in DMADP pool size during <b>temperature</b> <b>transients.</b> These results have important implications for the development of process-based models of isoprene emission...|$|R

Analytical solution is constructed for DPL bio-heat transfer equation with constant, periodic and pulse train heat flux conditions on skin surface. Separation of variables and Duhamel’s theorem for a skin tissue as a finite domain are employed. The <b>transient</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>responses</b> for constant and time-dependent boundary conditions are obtained and discussed.

The results illustrate that the DPL model reduces to the hyperbolic model when T approaches zero and the classic Fourier model when both thermal relaxations approach zero. However for q T the DPL model anticipates different temperature distribution with that predicted by the Pennes model. Such discrepancy is due to the blood perfusion term in energy equation.

The effect of partial premixing on soot formation is of relevance also for real combustion devices and still needs to be fully understood. An improved version of the thermophoretic particle densitometry (TPD) method has been used in this work with the aim to obtain both quantitative and qualitative information of soot particles generated in a set of laminar partially-premixed coflow flames characterized by different equivalence ratios. To this aim, the <b>transient</b> thermocouple <b>temperature</b> <b>response</b> has been analyzed to infer particle concentration and emissivity. A variety of thermal emissivity values have been measured for flame-formed carbonaceous particles, ranging from 0. 4 to 0. 5 for the early nucleated soot particles up to the value of 0. 95, representing the typical value commonly attributed to mature soot particles, indicating that the correct determination of the thermal emissivity is necessary to accurately evaluate the particle volume fraction. This is particularly true at the early stage of the soot formation, when particle concentration measurement is indeed particularly challenging as in the central region of the diffusion flames. With increasing premixing, an initial increase of particles is detected both in the maximum radial soot volume fraction region and in the central region of the flame, while the further addition of primary air determines the particle volume fraction drop.
