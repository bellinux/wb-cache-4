5|$|A typical {{feature in}} Vanajas was over-engineered {{structures}} which were robust rather than optimised. The main components were sourced from well-established suppliers. VAT also showed progressive thinking in driver ergonomics; the comfortably sprung and hydraulically damped driver's seat was positioned close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>to</b> ease reversing. The seat had several {{ways in which}} it could be adjusted. Hanging pedals, which were set to the same level, became standard at an early stage. Vanaja's interior heater, which produced 9,000kcal/h, was possibly the most efficient available in lorries by the 1960s. Many Vanaja drivers valued the particularly soft suspension of the vehicles. Two-axle lorries were available in 4×2 and 4×4 layouts; the three-axle models were produced as 6×2, 6×4, 4×4+2 and 6×6.|$|E
25|$|Anne Neville died on 16 March 1485, {{probably}} of tuberculosis, at Westminster. The day she died, {{there was}} an eclipse, which some took to be an omen of her husband's fall from heavenly grace. She was buried in Westminster Abbey in an unmarked grave {{to the right of}} the High Altar, next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the Confessor's Chapel. Richard III is said to have wept at her funeral. Nevertheless, rumours circulated that Richard III had poisoned her in order to marry his niece Elizabeth of York.|$|E
25|$|Until 1916, mail {{carriers}} {{knocked on}} the door and waited patiently for someone to answer. Efficiency experts estimated that each mailman lost over 1.5 hours each day just waiting for patrons to come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>To</b> correct this problem, the Post Office Department ordered that every household must have a mail box or letter slot in order to receive mail. This requirement was phased in, starting with new delivery locations, around 1912. Slowly, homeowners and businesses began to install mail slots or attached mailboxes to receive mail when they were either not at home or unable to answer the door. The requirement was made mandatory in 1923.|$|E

25|$|Women {{look for}} certain cues {{on a first}} date: For example, it is {{important}} to a woman {{to find out if the}} man is courteous or not. Women will look for this by observing if the man comes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> pick her up or if he opens doors for her, or compliments her on how she looks, for example. If some of her expectations are not met, mainly the most important ones, she will not want to pursue anything more than a friendship. If the expectations are met, a second date might be in the future, but only if the man is feeling the same thing.|$|E
2500|$|Kane's young deputy Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges), who is bitter that Kane did not {{recommend}} {{him as his}} successor, says he will stand with Kane only if Kane goes to the city fathers and [...] "puts the word in" [...] for him. [...] Kane rejects the quid pro quo, and Pell turns in his badge. [...] Kane visits a series of old friends and allies, but none can (or will) help: His predecessor, Marshal Howe (Lon Chaney Jr.) is old and arthritic; Judge Percy Mettrick (Otto Kruger), who sentenced Miller, flees on horseback, and urges Kane to do the same; townsman Herb Baker (James Millican) agrees to be deputized, but backs out when he realizes {{he is the only}} volunteer; [...] Sam Fuller (Harry Morgan) hides in his house, sending his wife (Eve McVeagh) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> tell Kane he isn't home.|$|E
2500|$|Interviewed in 2011, {{the father}} {{of one of the}} girls who died said he had thought the trip was simply to the Lagganlia centre and he had no idea {{that they were going to}} be {{climbing}} the mountains. On the Sunday night a policeman had come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> say they would be late home – even in Edinburgh there was strong wind and deep snow. Later in the night a newspaper reporter arrived and said the whole party was missing. It was only on Monday afternoon when the parents were gathered at the school that the news came that five children were dead. The father explained that the boy who survived was the smallest child in the party – maybe the others (two women leaders, four girls and one boy) had been huddling round him to protect him from the cold. In 2015 someone who had been a pupil at the school in 1971 wrote [...] "The school was in mourning for some time after that and I don't think that Mr Chalmers, the headmaster, ever really recovered." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later that night, Amahl's mother weeps, {{praying that}} Amahl {{not become a}} beggar ("Don't Cry Mother Dear"). After bedtime ("From Far Away We Come"), {{there is a knock}} at the door and the mother tells Amahl to go see who it is ("Amahl ... Yes Mother!"). He is amazed when he sees three splendidly dressed kings (the Magi). At first the mother does not believe Amahl, but when she goes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> see for herself, she is stunned. The Three Kings tell the mother and Amahl they are on a long journey to give gifts to a wondrous Child and they would like to rest at their house, to which the mother agrees ("Good Evening!"; [...] "Come In!"), saying that all she can offer is [...] "a cold {{fireplace}} and a bed of straw". The mother goes to fetch firewood, and Amahl seizes the opportunity to speak with the kings. King Balthazar answers Amahl's questions about his life as a king and asks what Amahl does. Amahl responds that he was once a shepherd, but his mother had to sell his sheep. Now, he and his mother will have to go begging. Amahl then talks with King Kaspar, who is childlike, eccentric, and a bit deaf. Kaspar shows Amahl his box of magic stones, beads, and licorice, and offers Amahl some of the candy ("Are You A Real King?"; [...] "This is My Box"). The mother returns ("Amahl, I Told You Not To Be A Nuisance!"). He defends himself, saying [...] "They kept asking me questions," [...] when of course it has in fact been Amahl asking the kings questions. Amahl is told to go fetch the neighbors ("All These Beautiful Things"; [...] "Have You Seen a Child?") so the kings may be fed and entertained properly ("Shepherds! Shepherds!"; [...] "Emily! Emily"; [...] "Olives and Quinces"; [...] "Dance of the Shepherds").|$|E
