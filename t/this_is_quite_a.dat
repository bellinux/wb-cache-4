[...] In contrast, Kitty Empire of The Guardian felt that [...] "comedian Chris Rock is hilariously foul-mouthed {{at the end of}} Blame Game." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator called the song epic, but felt that Rock's appearance served as a detriment to the song, writing; [...] "we’d kill the last two minutes with Rock’s unfocused, not-as-funny-as-we-think-it’s-supposed-to-be rambling, but otherwise, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> beautiful track." [...] "Blame Game" [...] charted on South Korean Gaon Chart at position 81.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{possible}} to reason about von Neumann ordinals in NFU. Recall that a von Neumann ordinal is a transitive set A such that the restriction of membership to A is a strict well-ordering. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> strong condition in the NFU context, since the membership relation involves a difference of type. A von Neumann ordinal A is not an ordinal {{in the sense of}} NFU, but [...] belongs to an ordinal [...] which may be termed the order type of (membership on) A. It is easy to show that the order type of a von Neumann ordinal A is cantorian: for any well-ordering W of order type , the induced well-ordering of initial segments of W by inclusion has order type [...] (it is one type higher, thus the application of T): but the order types of the well-ordering of a von Neumann ordinal A by membership and the well-ordering of its initial segments by inclusion are clearly the same because the two well-orderings are actually the same relation, so the order type of A is fixed under T. Moreover, the same argument applies to any smaller ordinal (which will be the order type of an initial segment of A, also a von Neumann ordinal) so the order type of any von Neumann ordinal is strongly cantorian.|$|E

60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> {{new point}} of view to Clara. 'It is his own fault,' she said.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> god-send for Barry, who {{was only}} anxious to be off; but Anty begged for a respite.|$|R
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> {{new idea}} to Alice, {{and she thought}} it over a little before she made her next remark. 'Then the {{eleventh}} day {{must have been a}} holiday?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you again, Mr. Mavering. All <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> revelation. I'm glad to {{know how}} you really felt about things that you seemed so eager for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> {{peculiar}} straw. If you strew {{it about}} {{even in the}} hottest summer the air at once becomes cold, and snow falls, and the people freeze.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{one sense}} the last will be true, though not {{altogether}} in another. As a school-boy, I have often played, school-boy fashion; but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> new thing with us, to be amateur players." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{raised her}} {{delicate}} eyebrows till {{they looked like}} notes of interrogation, and blushed <b>a</b> little. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> new style for Sir Eustace. Was he in earnest? she wondered. Impossible! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> {{new idea}} to Mrs. Dashwood; {{she had never}} been used to find wit in the {{inattention}} of any one, and could not help looking with surprise at them both.|$|R
60|$|So he sailed {{due south}} for two days, {{and at the}} end of that time they came in sight of land. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> large island, and when they {{approached}} near enough, they saw upon its shores a very handsome city.|$|R
6000|$|... "One of you {{had better}} call in a policeman," [...] {{returned}} the detective. [...] "Then we'll take them to headquarters. I think <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> catch," [...] he continued. [...] "The authorities {{have been trying to}} fasten something on Grimes for a long while." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so," [...] Mr. Jarvis replied. [...] "After that, we'll shut up shop. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> red-letter day, Chetwode. I {{knew that}} we'd held our own, but I must confess that I found those figures most exhilarating. Our little bonus, too, {{will be worth}} having." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> case in point," [...] I said. [...] "Now, Mr. Homos, here is {{a chance}} to inform {{yourself}} at first hand about a very interesting fact of our civilization"; and I added, in a low voice, to Mrs. Makely: [...] "Won't you introduce us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And the author? A slow {{suspicion}} {{burned in}} my mind. The author was taking it rather too easily in his stride. Evidently, he felt <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> usual thing. He made absolutely {{no attempt to}} conceal this knowledge. The story continued: ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{the custom}} at Colby Hall for the {{officers}} of the battalion to take dinner with Colonel Colby {{on the day of}} <b>an</b> election. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> formal affair and the cadets to participate {{made it a point to}} look their best.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> serious {{turning point}} for the Mennonite {{religion}} and culture in the new world. Never before did anything so serious cause a break-up of the church, and among Mennonites who had suffered persecution together in Germany and Switzerland, not too many years earlier.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{first thing}} to tell you," [...] Tom said, [...] "is our names. We go by the names of Tom and Peter Scudamore, but I need {{scarcely}} tell you {{that these are not}} our real names. The fact is--but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> secret--we are the eldest sons of Sir Arthur Wellesley--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And, at any rate, {{how much}} more expeditions that I should go myself!" [...] says he. [...] "But all <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> waste of breath. At seven to-morrow the chaise {{will be at the}} door. For I start from the door, Mackellar; I do not skulk through woods and take my chaise upon the wayside - shall we say, at Eagles?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heyday!" [...] said Edmund, [...] "here's company, here's a carriage! {{who have}} {{they got to}} meet us?" [...] And letting down the side-glass to distinguish, [...] "'Tis Crawford's, Crawford's barouche, I protest! There are his own two men pushing it back into its old quarters. He is here, of course. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> surprise, Fanny. I shall be very glad to see him." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>an</b> {{advantageous}} {{event for}} Oda Nobunaga, as it weakened his enemies; {{the battle of}} Temmokuzan the following year would {{come to be known}} as Takeda Katsuyori's last stand. Nounaga sent Mori Nagahide to capture his fortress and the siege ended within four months.|$|R
60|$|MacPherson did so, {{feeling as}} if he were paying a visit to the dentist. As long as there had been others with him in this affair he had looked on it as a splendid idea. But to be singled out like <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> {{different}} thing.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in White Horse Close on the Canongate on Edinburgh’s Royal Mile on 6 May 1793. At this time in history <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> humble address. His father John Dick was a young farrier who had moved south from Aberdeen with his young wife, Jean.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Shirley, dipping the pen in the ink, {{and putting}} it into his hand, [...] "you must regard me as Captain Keeldar to-day. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> gentleman's affair--yours and mine entirely, doctor" [...] (so she had dubbed the rector). [...] "The ladies there are only to be our aides-de-camp, and at their peril they speak, till we have settled the whole business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, dear, I believe I {{know the}} very thing to keep your hair from getting loose. It's such lovely hair. And <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> new thing, and doesn't show at all; invented by a very nice hairdresser in Worcester. It's {{simplicity}} itself. Do let me show you!" [...] Quickly going over, she removed the kingfisher-blue fillet, and making certain passes with her fingers through the hair, murmured: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{not only}} ourselves," [...] said the doctor, in reply to some {{questions}} from Mrs. Drane {{in regard to the}} intended journey, [...] "who are going this afternoon. We take with us Mrs. Bannister and Dora. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> sudden plan, only determined upon last night. They both want a little Barport life before the season closes, and thought it would be pleasant to go with us." ...|$|E
50|$|Millwall {{played on}} a variety of grounds on the Isle of Dogs. It was not unusual for Millwall to attract thirty or forty {{thousand}} spectators to a game, especially at their second ground at East Ferry Road. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>an</b> achievement, given that travelling facilities were sparse.|$|R
6000|$|... "They are clear-headed fellows, these Scotchmen; {{whether they}} are in our army or Frederick's. What makes the affair more {{wonderful}} <b>is</b> that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> young fellow, and probably understood no German; but I {{think that he would}} have acted more wisely, had he waited until the spring." ...|$|R
50|$|During the transfer, {{the staff}} had to {{participate}} in some very basic military training (stand in line and salute), so they could present a nice front on arrival. For some, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> nuisance - for others, a source of much joyful entertainment. Jutlandia made the journey in 38 days.|$|R
60|$|The {{question}} for the medical faculty is: Does a decided taste for wilful fire-raising often accompany exhibitions of dancing furniture and crockery, gratuitously given by patients of hysterical temperament? <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> normal inquiry. Is there a nervous malady of which the symptoms are domestic arson, and amateur leger-de- main? The complaint, if it exists, is of very old standing and wide prevalence, including Russia, Scotland, New England, France, Iceland, Germany, China and Peru.|$|E
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> study;—sometimes you {{see this}} {{youthful}} god of poetry connecting disparate thoughts purely by means of resemblances in the words expressing them,—a thing in character in lighter comedy, especially of that kind in which Shakespeare delights, namely, the purposed display of wit, though sometimes too, disfiguring his graver scenes;—but more often you may see him doubling the natural connection or order of logical consequence in the thoughts {{by the introduction of}} an artificial and sought for resemblance in the words, as, for instance, in the third line of the play,— ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{the street}} they met people from home--the McGanums. They laughed, shook hands repeatedly, and exclaimed, [...] "Well, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> coincidence!" [...] They asked when the McGanums had come down, and begged for {{news of the}} town they had left two days before. Whatever the McGanums were at home, here they stood out as so {{superior}} to all the undistinguishable strangers absurdly hurrying past that the Kennicotts held them {{as long as they}} could. The McGanums said good-by as though they were going to Tibet instead of to the station to catch No. 7 north.|$|E
50|$|Deliveries during 1977 {{amounted}} to seven new locomotives, six {{of which were}} to the Ministry of Defence, and seven major rebuilds, three of them being 0- 6-0. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> good effort out of one small workshop and {{was to be the}} last full year under these restricted conditions.|$|R
50|$|It {{was while}} he was still just a teenager, helping his father that the idea of selling {{products}} at a fixed price came to him. At the time, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> revolution away from current business practices. This greatly pleased customers who appreciated competitive pricing without the need for bargaining.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>an</b> {{author and}} <b>this</b> author changed history {{and along with}} it {{the fate of the}} MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians, whose own history is as rich and is as ancient as the land they still main their Sovereign Rights of Possession, Use, and Occupancy to this very day.|$|R
