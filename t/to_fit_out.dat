5|$|On 1 August 1883 the New South Wales {{government}} made a proclamation which transferred {{control of the}} Technical and Working Men's College to an independent Board of Technical Education, to which Selfe was appointed, and assumed financial responsibility directly. The government also provided funds <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> workshops in Kent Street that opened in 1886. This was an initiative driven by Selfe, who had admired the workshop teaching model abroad. It represented a major innovation in technical education in New South Wales.|$|E

25|$|Melampus, {{the second}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy, was ordered on 1 May 1816, laid down in August 1817 at Pembroke Dockyard, Wales, and {{launched}} on 10 August 1820. She was completed for ordinary at Plymouth Dockyard 2–23 September 1829 and was roofed over from the mainmast forward. The ship cost £23,007 to built and £7,072 <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> for ordinary. She was fitted out for sea at a total cost of £9,156 from March to 18 May 1845.|$|E

25|$|After the Home Service {{men and the}} unfit {{had been}} {{transferred}} to the 2/4th Bn, the 1/4th was brought up to strength with recruits and training continued at Bury St Edmunds. The battalion moved to Thetford in Norfolk in November 1914. At Easter 1915 the East Anglian Division moved into the coast defences, the 1/4th Bn being stationed in Norwich. In May the battalion moved back to Bury St Edmunds <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> with tropical kit for overseas service. The 1st East Anglian Division was now numbered as the 54th (East Anglian) Division, with the East Midlands Brigade becoming 162nd (East Midland) Brigade. On 29 July the 1/4th Northamptons entrained, and sailed the following day from Devonport aboard the transport Royal George.|$|E
25|$|At this point, the Carthaginian senate {{reinstated}} Hanno {{and forced}} Hamilcar to share command. The Punic generals pursued Matho’s army and won several small-scale engagements. After mustering their forces, a decisive battle was fought probably {{near the town}} of Leptis Minor. The Carthaginians destroyed the rebel army, after which the Libyan towns submitted to Carthage. When Utica and Hippo Acra held out, Hanno and Hamilcar besieged them, eventually receiving their surrender on terms. By the winter of 238 BC, the Mercenary revolt was over. Hanno and Hamilcar unleashed reprisals against the Numidian tribes that had sided with the rebels, and the generals probably extended Carthaginian territory in Africa at the same time. Carthage now began <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> an expedition to recover Sardinia, with Hamilcar commanding Punic forces.|$|E
25|$|The loss of {{materiel}} on {{the beaches}} was huge. The British Army left enough equipment behind <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> about eight to ten divisions. Discarded in France were, among other things, huge supplies of ammunition, 880 field guns, 310 guns of large calibre, some 500 anti-aircraft guns, about 850 anti-tank guns, 11,000 machine guns, nearly 700 tanks, 20,000 motorcycles and 45,000 motor cars and lorries. Army equipment available at home was only just sufficient to equip two divisions. The British Army needed months to re-supply properly and some planned introductions of new equipment were halted while industrial resources concentrated on making good the losses. Officers told troops falling back from Dunkirk to burn or otherwise disable their trucks (so as not to let them benefit the advancing German forces). The shortage of army vehicles after Dunkirk was so severe that the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) was reduced to retrieving and refurbishing obsolete buses and coaches from British scrapyards to press them into use as troop transports. Some of these antique workhorses were still in use {{as late as the}} North African campaign of 1942.|$|E

25|$|Bolts {{refused to}} give up on his hopes for a voyage to the North West coast of America. Emperor Joseph II {{released}} Bolts from his obligations (except to his creditors) and gave him leave in November 1782 to take his proposal to the court of Catherine II of Russia. The Russian Court proved unresponsive, so Bolts also put his proposal before the court of Joseph’s brother-in-law, Ferdinand IV, King of Naples He had an encouraging response from Naples, where King Ferdinand’s Minister of Commerce and the Navy, General Sir John Acton, wanted to promote the kingdom’s maritime trade. King Ferdinand gave Bolts a charter, modelled on that he had received from the Empress Maria Theresa in 1776, with a term of twenty-one years from 1786, for a Royal Indian Company of Naples (Regia Società del India di Napoli), but the Neapolitan government agreed to support Bolts only after he had made a successful initial voyage at his own expense and risk. Preparations were begun in Marseilles <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> the Ferdinand, a ship Bolts planned to send to the North West Coast under the Neapolitan flag, but the venture was abandoned when Bolts received a more positive response from the French government.|$|E

500|$|Alexandra {{was highly}} {{popular with the}} British public. After she married the Prince of Wales in 1863, a new park and [...] "People's Palace", a public {{exhibition}} and arts centre under construction in north London, were renamed the Alexandra Palace and park to commemorate her. There are at least sixty-seven roads and streets in the Greater London area alone called Alexandra Road, Alexandra Avenue, Alexandra Gardens, Alexandra Close or Alexandra Street, all named after her. Unlike her husband and mother-in-law, she was not castigated by the press. Funds that she helped to collect were used to buy a river launch, called Alexandra, to ferry the wounded during the Sudan campaign, and <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> a hospital ship, named The Princess of Wales, to bring back wounded from the Boer War. During the Boer War, Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service, later renamed Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps, was founded under Royal Warrant.|$|E

500|$|During the Bishops' Wars {{the king}} {{attempted}} to blockade Scotland, disrupting {{trade and the}} transport of returning troops from the continent. The king planned amphibious assaults from England {{on the east coast}} and from Ireland to the west, but they failed to materialise. Scottish privateers took English prizes and the Covenanters planned <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> Dutch ships with Scottish and Dutch crews to join the naval war effort. After the Covenanters allied with the English Parliament they established two patrol squadrons for the Atlantic and North Sea coasts, known collectively as the [...] "Scotch Guard". These patrols guarded against Royalist attempts to move men, money and munitions and raids on Scottish shipping, particularly from ships based in Wexford and Dunkirk. They consisted mainly of small English warships, controlled by the Commissioners of the Navy based in London, but it always relied heavily on Scottish officers and revenues, and after 1646, the West Coast squadron became much more a Scottish force. The Scottish navy was unable to withstand the English fleet that accompanied the army led by Cromwell that conquered Scotland in 1649–51. The Scottish ships and crews were divided among the Commonwealth fleet.|$|E
500|$|When Castor {{returned}} to Britain, the frigate was classed by the Admiralty and the Navy Board as [...] "salvage" [...] {{rather than as}} a prize. The laws regarding salvage meant that the proportion of prize money due to be paid to Laforey and his crew was significantly reduced by the declaration. The grounds for this judgement were that after its capture by the French, Castor was not taken into a French harbour and properly condemned by a French prize court and commissioned into the French Navy, the normal legal requirement for what was termed a [...] "complete prize". On behalf of his men Laforey brought a legal challenge against the ruling to the High Court of Admiralty to determine the status of Castor. The judge, Sir James Marriott, heard evidence from a number of parties, including a deposition by Captain L'Huillier that described Admiral Nielly's standing orders <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> any captured warships at sea for continued service in the campaign. After considering the evidence Marriott ruled that Castor was a legitimate prize [...] "setting forth as a ship of war", and that the normal prize rules should apply to Laforey's case. The prize money for the purchase of the frigate was therefore authorised to be paid at Plymouth on 20 July 1795.|$|E
