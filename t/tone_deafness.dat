25|$|Congenital amusia, {{commonly}} known as <b>tone</b> <b>deafness,</b> refers to a musical disability that cannot be explained by prior brain lesion, hearing loss, cognitive defects, or lack of environmental stimulation, and it affects about 4% of the population. Individuals who suffer from congenital amusia seem to lack the musical predispositions with which most people are born. They are unable to recognize or hum familiar tunes {{even if they have}} normal audiometry and above-average intellectual and memory skills. Also, they do not show sensitivity to dissonant chords in a melodic context, which, as discussed earlier, is one of the musical predispositions exhibited by infants. The hallmark of congenital amusia is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination, and this deficit is most apparent when congenital amusics are asked to pick out a wrong note in a given melody. If the distance between two successive pitches is small, congenital amusics are not able to detect a pitch change. As a result of this defect in pitch perception, a lifelong musical impairment may emerge due to a failure to internalize musical scales. A lack of fine-grained pitch discrimination makes it extremely difficult for amusics to enjoy and appreciate music, which consists largely of small pitch changes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tone</b> <b>deafness</b> is {{characterized}} by the inability to discriminate between different pitches, which are directly related to the frequencies of sound waves. <b>Tone</b> <b>deafness</b> is a related, but distinct disorder from beat deafness. People with <b>tone</b> <b>deafness</b> can recognize beat and can move in time to music, but they cannot perceive pitch. People with beat deafness on the other hand, can recognize and distinguish between different tones as well as the average person and can usually sing in tune, so musical pitch is not the issue.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with self-reported “tone deafness ” and its possible relationship to congenital amusia. Nearly 17 % of over 2000 first-year psychology students at Queen’s University self-reported <b>tone</b> <b>deafness.</b> Two hundred students were recruited from this pool of students, comprising 100 who reported <b>tone</b> <b>deafness</b> and 100 who {{reported that they were}} not tone-deaf (NTD). The study contained two parts. In part 1, participants completed the six tests of the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA) devel-oped by Peretz and collaborators. In part 2, participants completed an exten-sive questionnaire designed to elicit details about musical experiences, abilities, training, and interests. Twenty-eight questionnaire items allowing a quantita-tive response were subjected to factor analysis. Four orthogonal components emerged from the analysis. The components reflected self-report of (1) vocal production, (2) music instruction, (3) listening attitudes, and (4) childhood memories of musical environment. Results for each of the MBEA tests and composite scores for all tests were regressed on participants ’ factor scores. The best and significant predictors of the MBEA scores were factor I and factor II, followed by factor III. Factor scores accounted for a higher percentage of the variance in MBEA composite test results (27 %) than the self-report of <b>tone</b> <b>deafness</b> alone (7 %). The musical difficulties revealed by the MBEA test results for some participants warrant further attention and study. However, an encouraging conclusion from the MBEA results is that many individuals who consider themselves “tone-deaf ” may not, in fact, have perceptual difficulties, and these individuals should be supported in any of their efforts to proceed with music enjoyment and instruction...|$|E

40|$|Research has {{suggested}} that around 17 % of Western adults self-define as "tone deaf" (Cuddy, Balkwill, Peretz & Holden, 2005). But questions remain about {{the exact nature of}} <b>tone</b> <b>deafness.</b> One candidate for a formal definition is "congenital amusia" (Peretz et al., 2003), characterised by a dense music-specific perceptual deficit. However, most people self-defining as tone deaf are not congenitally amusic (Cuddy et al., 2005). According to Sloboda, Wise and Peretz (2005), the general population defines <b>tone</b> <b>deafness</b> as perceived poor singing ability, suggesting the need to extend investigations to production abilities and self-perceptions. The present research aims to discover if self-defined tone deaf people show any pattern of musical difficulties relative to controls, and to offer possible explanations for them (e. g. perceptual, cognitive, productive, motivational). 13 self-reporting "tone deaf" (TD) and 17 self-reporting "not tone deaf" (NTD) participants were assessed on a range of measures for musical perception, cognition, memory, production and self-ratings of performance. This paper reports on four measures to assess perception (Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia), vocal production (songs and pitch-matching) and self-report. Results showed that the TDgroup performed significantly less well than the NTDgroup in all measures, but did not demonstrate the dense deficits characteristic of "congenital amusics". Singing performance was influenced by context, with both groups performing better when accompanied than unaccompanied. The TDgroup self-rated the accuracy of their singing significantly lower than the NTDgroup, but not disproportionately so, and were less confident in their vocal quality. The TDparticipants are not facing an insurmountable difficulty, but are likely to improve with targeted intervention. ...|$|E

40|$|Singing is {{as natural}} as {{speaking}} {{for the majority of}} people.

This condition, commonly referred to as <b>tone</b> <b>deafness,</b> has been observed both in the presence and absence of deficient pitch perception. In this article we review the existing literature concerning normal singing, poor-pitch singing, and, briefly, the sources of this condition. Considering that pitch plays a prominent role in the structure of both music and speech we also focus on the possibility that pitch production (or imitation) is similarly impaired in poor-pitch singers. Preliminary evidence from our laboratory on poor-pitch singing suggests that pitch imitation may be selectively inaccurate in the music domain without being affected in speech.

40|$|ABSTRACT—It is {{estimated}} that about 4 % of the general popu-lation may have amusia (or <b>tone</b> <b>deafness).</b> Congenital amusia is a lifelong disability for processing music despite normal in-tellectual, memory, and language skills. Here we present evi-dence that the disorder stems from a deficit in fine-grained pitch perception. Amusic and control adults were presented with monotonic and isochronous sequences of five tones (i. e., con-stant pitch and intertone interval). They were required to detect when the fourth tone was displaced in pitch or time. All amusic participants were impaired in detecting the pitch changes, and {{showed no sign of}} improvement with practice. In contrast, they detected time changes as well as control adults and exhibited similar improvements with practice. Thus, the degraded pitch perception seen in the amusic individuals cannot be ascribed to nonspecific problems with the task or to poor hearing in general...|$|E

40|$|Congenital amusia (or <b>tone</b> <b>deafness)</b> is {{a lifelong}} {{disorder}} characterized by impairments in the perception and production of music. A previous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study revealed that amusic individuals had reduced white matter in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) relative to musically intact controls (Hyde et al., 2006). However, this VBM study also revealed associated increases in gray matter in the same right IFG region of amusics. The objective {{of the present study}} was to better understand this morphological brain anomaly by way of cortical thickness measures that provide a more specific measure of cortical morphology relative to VBM. We found that amusic subjects (n � 21) have thicker cortex in the right IFG and the right auditory cortex relative to musically intact controls (n � 26). These cortical thickness differences suggest the presence of cortical malformations in the amusic brain, such as abnormal neuronal migration, that may have compromised the normal development of a right frontotemporal pathway.

40|$|Congenital amusia (or <b>tone</b> <b>deafness)</b> is {{a lifelong}} {{disability}} that prevents otherwise normal-functioning individuals from developing basic musical skills.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the structural neural correlates of congenital amusia. To this aim, voxel-based morphometry was used to detect brain anatomical differences in amusic individuals relative to musically intact controls, by analysing T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance images from two independent samples of subjects. The results were consistent across samples in highlighting a reduction in white matter concentration in the right inferior frontal gyrus of amusic individuals. This anatomical anomaly was correlated with performance on pitch-based musical tasks. The results are consistent with neuroimaging findings implicating right inferior frontal regions in musical pitch encoding and melodic pitch memory. We conceive the present results as a consequence of an impoverished communication in a right-hemisphere-based network involving the inferior frontal cortex and the right auditory cortex.

40|$|Singing, {{but not in}} tune while singing Teachers' {{experiences}} of students with song disabilities and song disabilities topics in the Norwegian compulsory school. A compulsory school without children singing? Unthinkable. Song and the compulsory school practice in Norway have been, and still are, in symbiosis with each other. "Now, let`s all sing together!" is a generally common expression. Singing {{is an important part}} of the music subject in the compulsory school and is integrated into other subjects, used as a tool for learning and a learning method. The general perception is that to sing has a value of its own, and that it means to be singing in cooperation and harmony with others. The singing itself is also regarded to have a value of its own for the pupils' personal development and self-perception. Singing is still something to be mastered within certain cultural norms. Some school pupils are struggling with the singing, and are experiencing song-related difficulties. The song disabilities covered in this thesis are the two phenomenas <b>tone</b> <b>deafness</b> and tone monotoners. This thesis is cumulative and encompasses, and is built upon, earlier research and literature which has been important regarding the song disabilities theme. Research has disclosed that adult people, who had song disabilities during their compulsory school, at that time experienced to be slighted. Song disabilities were neglected. To lack song" has been a great loss to many of them later in life. How does contemporary compulsory school deal with song disabilities? Do the pupils with song disabilities get the option to develop a singing voice of their own? This I would investigate and write about, and the focus of this thesis became: What thoughts and reflections do six music teachers have regarding pupils with singing difficulties and about the song disabilities topic in compulsory school". The method of this investigation is the qualitative research interview. The informants contribute with their experience and knowledge to disclose how the school handles pupils with singing problems and the song disorder topic. The empirical material shows that the song disability is still a non topic" in the Norwegian compulsory school of today. I hope that this thesis may initiate a change of attitude in the compulsory school, in order to treat pupils with song disabilities in a serious manner...|$|E
