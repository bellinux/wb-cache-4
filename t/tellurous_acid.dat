5|$|Tellurium is a silvery-white shiny solid. It has a {{density of}} 6.24 g/cm3, is brittle, {{and is the}} softest of the {{commonly}} recognised metalloids, being marginally harder than sulfur. Large pieces of tellurium are stable in air. The finely powdered form is oxidized by air {{in the presence of}} moisture. Tellurium reacts with boiling water, or when freshly precipitated even at 50°C, to give the dioxide and hydrogen: Te + 2 H2O → TeO2 + 2 H2. It reacts (to varying degrees) with nitric, sulfuric and hydrochloric acids to give compounds such as the sulfoxide TeSO3 or <b>tellurous</b> <b>acid</b> H2TeO3, the basic nitrate (Te2O4H)+(NO3)−, or the oxide sulfate Te2O3(SO4). It dissolves in boiling alkalis, to give the tellurite and telluride: 3 Te + 6 KOH = K2TeO3 + 2 K2Te + 3 H2O, a reaction that proceeds or is reversible with increasing or decreasing temperature.|$|E
5|$|Boron trifluoride and trichloride {{are used}} as {{catalysts}} in organic synthesis and electronics; the tribromide {{is used in the}} manufacture of diborane. Non-toxic boron ligands could replace toxic phosphorus ligands in some transition metal catalysts. Silica sulfuric acid (SiO2OSO3H) is used in organic reactions. Germanium dioxide is sometimes used as a catalyst in the production of PET plastic for containers; cheaper antimony compounds, such as the trioxide or triacetate, are more commonly employed for the same purpose despite concerns about antimony contamination of food and drinks. Arsenic trioxide has been used in the production of natural gas, to boost the removal of carbon dioxide, as have selenous acid and <b>tellurous</b> <b>acid.</b> Selenium acts as a catalyst in some microorganisms. Tellurium, and its dioxide and tetrachloride, are strong catalysts for air oxidation of carbon above 500°C. Graphite oxide {{can be used as a}} catalyst in the synthesis of imines and their derivatives. Activated carbon and alumina have been used as catalysts for the removal of sulfur contaminants from natural gas. Titanium doped aluminium has been identified as a substitute for expensive noble metal catalysts used in the production of industrial chemicals.|$|E

5000|$|Historically {{the name}} {{tellurate}} was only applied to oxyanions of tellurium with oxidation number +6, formally derived from telluric acid Te(OH)6, {{and the name}} tellurite referred to oxyanions of tellurium with oxidation number +4, formally derived from <b>tellurous</b> <b>acid</b> (HO)2TeO and these names are in common use.

40|$|Although gold tellurides are {{important}} sources {{of gold in}} several areas in the world, {{little attention has been}} paid to understanding how they might be processed. This paper describes an electrochemical study of the oxidation of one gold telluride, namely calaverite (AuTe 2) in acid solution. The principal technique in this study was cyclic voltammetry. Up to a potential of 0. 5 V (sce), the reaction products are gold metal and HTeO+ 2, as is predicted from the E-pH diagram. At potentials above 0. 75 V (sce), the reaction products are gold metal and solid <b>tellurous</b> <b>acid</b> which partially passivates the calaverite surface. <b>Tellurous</b> <b>acid</b> is soluble in 1. 0 M perchloric acid, being thermodynamically unstable. Under appropriate conditions an oscillating electrochemical reaction is observed. At lower pHs (up to about 2), the telluryl ion is observed. Above this pH, up to about 3, <b>tellurous</b> <b>acid</b> and gold are the preferred products...|$|E
