25|$|Stanger {{fell ill}} {{while he was}} aloft {{on one of his}} October sorties. He landed on a handy {{airfield}} and shut down his plane's engine before realizing he had landed on an Austro-Hungarian strip. His only chance to escape any enemy soldiers investigating the racket of an untimely landing was to restart his engine and fly away. The customary method for starting an engine was for a ground crew member <b>to</b> <b>yank</b> the propeller as a lever to crank the engine, while a pilot sat at the controls. Stanger's solution was to remove his boots and chock the landing gear tires with the footwear. He then cranked the prop, started the engine, circled about the rotating blades, clambered into the cockpit, and departed. The fate of the boots is unknown.|$|E
25|$|That same year, the deYoung family, {{owners of}} KRON-TV and the San Francisco Chronicle, {{put all of}} its media {{properties}} up for sale. NBC, which {{had been in the}} midst of renewing its affiliation agreement with KRON-TV, jumped into the bidding as it had sought to purchase channel 4—then the network's largest affiliate by market size—for several years due to its status as one of the network's highest-rated affiliates. NBC was thought to be the favorite to buy KRON-TV, but lost a bidding war for the station to Young Broadcasting in November 1999. NBC responded by threatening <b>to</b> <b>yank</b> its programming from KRON unless Young agreed to run it under the conventions of an NBC-owned outlet, including disallowing the station from preempting NBC programs outside of breaking news coverage. The network also made the unprecedented demand that Young pay NBC $10 million annually to carry the network's programming—a form of reverse compensation. Young refused, and announced that it would end KRON-TV's 52-year relationship with NBC once its affiliation contract ended in December 2001.|$|E

25|$|In 1986, KKR {{opted to}} put WTVJ and the Storer {{stations}} on the market. The firm {{had plans to}} sell channel 4 for a record price of close to $500 million (as part of a $1.85 billion group deal with six of the Storer stations), although the station was actually worth far less. CBS saw a chance to acquire an owned-and-operated station in the fast-growing Miami market. However, it lost a bidding war to television syndication company Lorimar-Telepictures. CBS, however, tried to block the deal; Lorimar produced Dallas, Knots Landing, Falcon Crest, and other shows for the network {{and did not want}} them controlling the clearance rights of those particular programs. Thus, CBS threatened <b>to</b> <b>yank</b> its affiliation with WTVJ if the Lorimar deal went through, which would force the station to become an independent. Lorimar then walked away from the group deal in May 1986, CBS then made an offer to buy WTVJ for $170 million, which was far below KKR's asking price of at least $270 million.|$|E

2500|$|Scorpion's {{signature}} finisher {{from the}} original game up until Mortal Kombat 4 was his [...] "Fire Breath" [...] Fatality, in which he removes his mask to reveal a skull right before immolating his opponent.

2500|$|Xavier Thaxton, {{protagonist of}} Count Geiger's Blues: A Comedy (Tor Books, 1992), is {{the fine arts}} editor for a {{newspaper}} in the fictional Southern metropolis of Salonika (a satirical/alternate reality version of contemporary Atlanta) with a particularly low opinion of pop culture. [...] When he is accidentally exposed to illegally dumped nuclear waste, the radiation exposure turns him into a superhero (or, as Bishop has designated, a [...] "stalwart"). Analog reviewer Tom Easton writes about the novel's resolution: [...] "This is where Bishop falters. The satire he has painstakingly [...] created now teeters {{on the brink of}} farce. He quite properly makes the decision <b>to</b> <b>yank</b> it back from that brink, but then he loses the satire. [...] He becomes heavy-handed and obvious." [...] Faren Miller disagrees: [...] "The most ambitious comic books are no longer merely comic – may even incorporate tragedy in a critique of modern life as savage and acute, in its way, as the ferocious satire of Dante's Inferno. Count Geiger's Blues also goes beyond humor – well beyond, in its remarkable closing chapters. [...] But they build on all that has gone before. In unleashing a startling talent for comedy and a wide-ranging knowledge of pop culture in both its absurdity and its splendor, Michael Bishop has written his best book yet." [...] John Kessel writes [...] "Comedy is certainly a new tone from Bishop, and he demonstrates a talent for it…But it seems to me Bishop doesn't really want to write comedy. It's as if Bishop is running riffs on whatever wacky ideas come to hand, without much plan, holding his characters at arm's length; as if, trying to avoid sententiousness, he has to avoid caring – but in the end can't. The result being a loose, baggy sort of book." ...|$|E
