In 2010, CART buses were modified to include a GPS tracking system that allows riders to see the location of buses and their predicted arrival times via <b>the</b> <b>CART</b> <b>and</b> Google websites. CART buses transport more than 1.3million travelers annually.|$|E
5|$|Iron Maiden {{were formed}} on Christmas Day in 1975 by bassist Steve Harris {{shortly after he}} left his {{previous}} group, Smiler. Harris attributes the band's name to a film adaptation of The Man in the Iron Mask from the novel by Alexandre Dumas, the title of which {{reminded him of the}} iron maiden torture device. After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976, before taking up a semi-residency at <b>the</b> <b>Cart</b> <b>and</b> Horses Pub in Maryland Point, Stratford.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil war}} {{had led to}} an {{economic}} collapse in the Transvaal, weakening the government's ability to back up its professed authority and sovereignty over the local chiefdoms, though Lydenburg and Utrecht did now accept the central administration. By 1865 tensions had risen with the Zulus {{to the east and}} war had broken out again between the Orange Free State and the Basotho. Pretorius and Kruger led a commando of about 1,000 men south to help the Free State. The Basotho were defeated and Moshoeshoe ceded some of his territory, but President Johannes Brand of the Free State decided not to give any of the conquered land to the Transvaal burghers. The Transvaal men were scandalised and returned home en masse, despite Kruger's attempts to maintain discipline. The following February, after a meeting of the executive council in Potchefstroom, Kruger capsized his cart during the journey home and broke his left leg. On one leg he righted <b>the</b> <b>cart</b> <b>and</b> continued the rest of the way. This injury incapacitated him for the next nine months, and his left leg was thereafter slightly shorter than his right.|$|E

25|$|In Germania, Tacitus {{records that}} the remote Suebi tribes were united by their veneration {{of the goddess}} at his time of writing and {{maintained}} a sacred grove on an (unspecified) island and that a holy cart rests there draped with cloth, which only a priest may touch. The priests feel her presence by <b>the</b> <b>cart,</b> <b>and,</b> with deep reverence, attend her cart, which is drawn by s. Everywhere the goddess then deigns to visit, she is met with celebration, hospitality, and peace. All iron objects are locked away, {{and no one will}} leave for war. When the goddess has had her fill she is returned to her temple by the priests. Tacitus adds that the goddess, <b>the</b> <b>cart,</b> <b>and</b> the cloth are then washed by slaves in a secluded lake. The slaves are then drowned.|$|E
25|$|Carlson {{spent his}} early {{childhood}} in Adelaide and almost {{died at the}} age of six following an incident with a train.

As Catholic soldiers force the peasants to guide the army to the city for a sneak attack, Kattrin fetches a drum from <b>the</b> <b>cart</b> <b>and</b> beats it, waking the townspeople, but is herself shot. Early in the morning, Mother Courage sings a lullaby to her daughter's corpse, has the peasants bury it, and hitches herself to the cart.|$|E

25|$|In medieval romances, one of {{the most}} {{prominent}} story arcs is Queen Guinevere's tragic love affair with her husband's chief knight, Lancelot. This story first appeared in Chrétien de Troyes's Lancelot, the Knight of <b>the</b> <b>Cart</b> <b>and</b> became a motif in Arthurian literature, starting with the Lancelot-Grail of the early 13th century and carrying through the Post-Vulgate Cycle and Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. Guinevere and Lancelot's betrayal of Arthur preceded his eventual defeat at the Battle of Camlann by Mordred.|$|E
25|$|Just 10 {{months after}} he bought his first bass, Harris joined a band, {{initially}} known as Influence and later Gypsy's Kiss, featuring Bob Verscoyle (lead vocals), Dave Smith (guitar) and drummer Paul Sears. After a short number of gigs at <b>the</b> <b>Cart</b> <b>and</b> Horses pub in Maryland Point, Stratford and the Bridgehouse in Canning Town, the band split up and Harris auditioned for a band called Smiler in February 1974. In this outfit, Harris began writing his own songs and worked with future Iron Maiden members Dennis Wilcock and Doug Sampson, but left the band after they refused to play his material, claiming it was too complicated.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{with the}} five works of Chrétien de Troyes, Gawain became a very popular figure in French chivalric romances in the later 12th century. Chrétien uses Gawain as a major {{character}} and establishes some characteristics that pervade later depictions, including his unparalleled courteousness and his way with women. His romances set the pattern often followed in later works in which Gawain serves as an ally to the protagonist and a model of knighthood to whom others are compared. However, in Chrétien's later romances, especially Lancelot, the Knight of <b>the</b> <b>Cart</b> <b>and</b> Perceval, the Story of the Grail, the title heroes prove morally superior to Gawain, who follows the rules of courtliness to the letter rather than the spirit.|$|E

25|$|The farm is {{equipped}} with three tractors which would have all seen service during the war - a Case, a Fordson N and a 1924 Fordson F. The farm also features horse drawn traps, reflecting the effect wartime rationing of petrol would have had on car use. The farming equipment in <b>the</b> <b>cart</b> <b>and</b> machinery sheds reflects the transition of the time from horse drawn to tractor pulled implements, with some older equipment put back into use due to the war, {{as well as a}} large Foster thresher, vital for cereal crop, and built specifically for the war effort, sold at the Newcastle Show. Although the wartime focus was on crops, the farm also features breeds of sheep, cattle, pigs and poultry that would have been typical for the time. The farm also has a portable steam engine, not in use, but presented as having been left out for collection as part of a wartime scrap metal drive.|$|E

The last stunt {{involves}} a ramp-jump in a shopping cart. During the stunt, Dare veers off and falls out of <b>the</b> <b>cart</b> <b>and</b> is found dead after part of his skull collapses. The local coroner calls in John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) to investigate the death. During the autopsy, flies erupt from Dare's eye sockets. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) examines the body and finds that the insects had fed on Dare's brain {{to such a degree}} that it simply collapsed.|$|E
500|$|All of {{the console}} {{versions}} include {{some form of}} dynamic musical score during gameplay, {{and in the case}} of the Mega Drive conversion, use arrangements of the music originating in the SNES and Apple IIGS versions. This differs from other versions which only have music for the opening and ending segments. Interplay wanted to add additional tunes by Charles Deenen. They also wanted to exchange Jean-François Freitas's music for a different soundtrack, but Chahi did not agree to the change and Delphine's lawyer helped to keep the original intro music. The Apple IIGS and Super NES versions were programmed by Rebecca Heineman, who said: [...] "Since Interplay wouldn't pay for a Super FX chip, I found a way to do it with static RAM on <b>the</b> <b>cart</b> <b>and</b> DMA which got me a great frame rate. Interplay wouldn't pay for the static RAM either, so I ended up using Fast ROM instruction. Interplay wouldn't pay for a 3.6 MHz ROM either. So, frustrated, I shoved my block move code into the DMA registers and use it as RAM running at 3.6 MHz. It worked. I got fast block moves on slow cartridges and made a game using polygons working on a 65816 with pure software rendering." [...] Another World is the only game directly ported from the Super NES to the Apple IIGS, which has the same 65C816 microprocessor.|$|E

Julian took no share in the work. He went dressed in the rough clothes he wore on the fishing excursions at night, and heartily enjoyed the animated bustle of the scene, as scores of men carrying kegs or bales on their backs, made their way up some narrow ravine, silently laid down their loads beside <b>the</b> <b>carts</b> <b>and</b> pack-horses, and then started back again for another trip. He occasionally lent a hand to lash the kegs {{on either side of the}} horses, or to lift a bale into <b>the</b> <b>cart.</b> No one ever asked any question; it was assumed that he was there with one of <b>the</b> <b>carts,</b> <b>and</b> he recognized <b>the</b> wisdom of Bill's advice the first time he went out.|$|R

2500|$|Achieving {{stability}} of an inverted pendulum {{has become a}} common engineering challenge for researchers. There are different variations of the inverted pendulum on a cart ranging from a rod on a cart to a multiple segmented inverted pendulum on a cart. Another variation places the inverted pendulum's rod or segmented rod {{on the end of}} a rotating assembly. In both, (<b>the</b> <b>cart</b> <b>and</b> rotating system) the inverted pendulum can only fall in a plane. The inverted pendulums in these projects can either be required to only maintain balance after an equilibrium position is achieved or be able to achieve equilibrium by itself. Another platform is a two-wheeled balancing inverted pendulum. The two wheeled platform has the ability to spin on the spot offering a great deal of maneuverability. Yet another variation balances on a single point. [...] A spinning top, a unicycle, or an inverted pendulum atop a spherical ball all balance on a single point. As derived above the inverted pendulum can also be achieved by having a vertically oscillating base.|$|E
