5|$|Godwin's books {{begin to}} {{incorporate}} religious themes starting with Father Melancholy's Daughter (1991). The novel is told {{from the perspective}} of multiple characters, each of whom have a different perspective on religion. Father Melancholy's Daughter was followed by several books that centered on the Episcopal church and Christian practices. In these novels female and male characters have a more equal influence on the events and plot than in prior novels. Godwin's books neither evangelize nor mock the practices of the Episcopal Church, but rather <b>treat</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a routine aspect of life, or as a subject of intellectual interest. During these years Godwin's books continued to show father figures who have died or are absent. By 1996 two of her books had fathers that died and five had stepfathers that are depicted as intruding on the mother-daughter relationship.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia {{has been}} {{classified}} into numerous families and subfamilies; in 1858 British entomologist Frederick Smith {{placed it in}} the family Poneridae, subfamily Myrmicidae. It {{was placed in the}} subfamily Ponerinae by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862. This classification was short-lived, as Mayr reclassified the genus into the subfamily Myrmicinae three years later. In 1877, Italian entomologist Carlo Emery classified the genus into the newly established subfamily Myrmeciidae, family Myrmicidae. Smith, who had originally established Myrmicidae as a family in 1851, reclassified it as a subfamily in 1858. He would again <b>treat</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a family in 1871. Swiss myrmecologist Auguste Forel initially treated Poneridae as a subfamily and classified Myrmecia as one of its constituent genera, but later placed it in Ponerinae. William H. Ashemad placed the genus in the subfamily Myrmeciinae in 1905, but it was later placed back in Ponerinae in 1910 by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler. In 1954, Myrmecia was placed into Myrmeciinae; this would be the last time the genus would be placed into a different ant subfamily.|$|E

25|$|The {{checkpoint}} was curiously asymmetrical. During its 28-year active life, {{the infrastructure}} on the Eastern side was {{expanded to include}} not only the wall, watchtower and zig-zag barriers, but a multi-lane shed where cars and their occupants were checked. However, the Allied authority never erected any permanent buildings, and made do with the well-known wooden shed, which was replaced during the 1980s by a larger metal structure, now displayed at the Allied Museum in western Berlin. Their reason was {{that they did not}} consider the inner Berlin sector boundary an international border and did not <b>treat</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> such.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{does not}} specify how one should alphabetize the letter ü {{when used in}} other languages than German, but at least as regards the Estonian or Hungarian ü, it seems consistent to <b>treat</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> equivalent to y (and even more so, since ü in Estonian and Hungarian is not considered a mere variant of u, {{as it is in}} German). It would seem problematic, however, to apply the same principle to e.g. ü (u-diaeresis) as used in Spanish or õ (nasal vowel) as used in Portuguese, as these letters represent quite different orthographic traditions.|$|E
25|$|To {{deal with}} the use of {{different}} graphemes for the same Unihan sememe, Unicode has relied on several mechanisms: especially as it relates to rendering text. One has been to <b>treat</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> simply a font issue so that different fonts might be used to render Chinese, Japanese or Korean. Also font formats such as OpenType allow for the mapping of alternate glyphs according to language so that a text rendering system can look to the user's environmental settings to determine which glyph to use. The problem with these approaches is that they fail to meet the goals of Unicode to define a consistent way of encoding multilingual text.|$|E

25|$|At {{this time}} Mason and Clayton had also {{completed}} the large bond store later known as Edinburgh House and the Otago Provincial Council building on blocks immediately {{adjacent to the}} Post Office. Those too are now gone but All Saints church in North Dunedin survives. There has been some ambivalence about the relative responsibility of Mason and Clayton for this commission, but most commentators <b>treat</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a joint production. Certainly Mason eventually completed it alone. An unusual building in polychromatic brick it reflects the innovations of William Butterfield in England. With its departure from a scholarly adherence to the Early Pointed manner of the Gothic style it also marks the onset of High Victorianism in New Zealand. This first portion of the building was finished in 1865.|$|E
25|$|Nineteen {{years after}} Voldemort's downfall, Ron and Hermione have two children: Rose Granger-Weasley, {{whom they are}} sending off to her first year at Hogwarts, and a younger son named Hugo. Though the {{epilogue}} does not explicitly say Ron and Hermione are married, news articles and other sources <b>treat</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a fact. Ron has also passed his Muggle driving test, despite Hermione's apparent belief {{that he could not}} do so without Confunding the examiner. (Ron secretly reveals to Harry he actually did Confund the examiner.) He and Harry work for the Ministry of Magic as Aurors, and along with Hermione they have helped to revamp the Ministry; it is far different from the one that existed previously. Before becoming an Auror, Ron joins George at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, which becomes a very lucrative business.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} {{treated as a}} {{subspecies}} of the common or black-winged stilt, using the trinomial name Himantopus himantopus mexicanus. However, the AOS has always considered it a species in its own right, and the scientific name Himantopus mexicanus is often seen. Matters are more complicated though; sometimes all five distinct lineages of the Common Stilt are treated as different species. But the white-backed stilt from southern South America (H. melanurus when the species is recognized), parapatric and intergrading to some extent with its northern relative where their ranges meet, would warrant inclusion with the Black-necked stilt when this is separated specifically, becoming Himantopus mexicanus melanurus. Similarly, the Hawaiian stilt, H. m. knudseni, is likely {{to belong to the}} American species when this is considered separate; while some <b>treat</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> another distinct species, the AOS, BirdLife International and the IUCN do not.|$|E

25|$|According to Jewish {{tradition}} {{the author}} of Kings was Jeremiah, {{who would have been}} alive during the fall of Jerusalem in 586BCE. The most common view today accepts Martin Noth's thesis that Kings concludes a unified series of books which reflect the language and theology of the Book of Deuteronomy, and which biblical scholars therefore call the Deuteronomistic history. Noth argued that the History was the work of a single individual living in the 6th century BCE, but scholars today tend to <b>treat</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> made up of at least two layers, a first edition from the time of Josiah (late 7th century BCE), promoting Josiah's religious reforms and the need for repentance, and (2) a second and final edition from the mid 6th century BCE. Further levels of editing have also been proposed, including: a late 8th century BCE edition pointing to Hezekiah of Judah as the model for kingship; an earlier 8th century BCE version with a similar message but identifying Jehu of Israel as the ideal king; and an even earlier version promoting the House of David as the key to national well-being.|$|E

He explains this by arguing that every irregular form, such as 'took', 'came' and 'got', has {{to be committed to}} memory by the children in each generation, or else lost, and that the common forms are the most easily memorized.
