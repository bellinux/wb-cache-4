The transition flows are observed {{for a range of}} intermediate discharges.

50|$|When Klinkenberg {{defined the}} {{interactions}} to be considered, he supposed {{the existence of}} a layer (sometimes called Knudsen layer), thinner than molecular mean free path, adjacent to the pore’s wall where only molecules-wall collisions would occur and collisions among molecules could be ignored. Thus the slippage velocity, as obtained from the Klinkenberg’s approach, captures the contribution of molecule-wall interactions and when this velocity is zero, the Poiseuille velocity profile (which results from molecule-molecule interactions) is recovered. However, Klinkenberg’s formulation ignores the <b>transition</b> <b>flow</b> region, where neither molecule-molecule nor molecule-wall interactions can be neglected because both are playing a relevant role. The feasibility of Klinkenberg linear function of the reciprocal pressure depends on the Knudsen number. For Knudsen numbers from 0.01 to 0.1 the Klinkenberg approach is acceptable.|$|E

The techniques of state-space diagonalization and decomposition, continuous-time embedding and Poincaré map analysis are combined and extended. It is revealed that high-order ΣΔ modulators can be transformed and decomposed into second- and first-order subsystems. The investigation, coupled with efficient numerical methods, generalizes itself to different types of <b>transition</b> <b>flow</b> and provides theoretical insight into the state trajectory and limit cycle behavior.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a gas-kinetic scheme {{to solve the}} multiple temperature kinetic model (MTKM), which was proposed in J. Comput. Math. 29 (6) (2011) 639 - 660, {{for the study of}} non-equilibrium flows. The MTKM is a two-stage particle collision model possessing an intermediate quasi-equilibrium state with a symmetric second-order temperature tensor. A gas-kinetic finite volume scheme is developed for the numerical solution of the MTKM in the continuum and <b>transition</b> <b>flow</b> regimes. The gas-kinetic scheme is designed for the updating of macroscopic variables, which include the conservative flow variables and the multiple temperature field. In order to validate the kinetic model, the gas-kinetic scheme is used in the study of lid-driven cavity flows in both continuum and <b>transition</b> <b>flow</b> regimes. The numerical results predicted by the MTKM are compared with those from the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), and the early three-temperature kinetic model (TFKM) proposed in Phys. Fluids 19, 016101 (2007). It is demonstrated that the MTKM has obvious advantages in comparison with the NSE and the TTKM in capturing the non-equilibrium flow behavior in the <b>transition</b> <b>flow</b> regime. One distinguishable phenomenon captured by the MTKM is that in the <b>transition</b> <b>flow</b> regime the heat flux direction can be from a low temperature to a high temperature region, which violates the Fourier's law of continuum flows. The MTKM provides a more accurate physical model than the NSE for the non-equilibrium flows. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Current common {{models for}} calculating {{continuous}} liquid-carrying critical gas velocity are established based on vertical wells and laminar flow without considering {{the influence of}} deviation angle and Reynolds number on liquid-carrying. With the increase of the directional well in <b>transition</b> <b>flow</b> or turbulent flow, the current common models cannot accurately predict the critical gas velocity of these wells. So we built a new model to predict continuous liquid-carrying critical gas velocity for directional well in <b>transition</b> <b>flow</b> or turbulent flow.

With the increase of Reynolds number, the critical liquid-carrying gas velocity increases first and then decreases.

It is indicated from the case calculation analysis that the calculation error of this new model is less than 10 %, where accuracy is much higher than those of current common models.
