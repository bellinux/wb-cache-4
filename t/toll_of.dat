5|$|The first {{historian}} to make {{an academic}} estimate of the death <b>toll</b> <b>of</b> the Nanking Massacre was Tomio Hora in his 1967 book Kindai Senshi no Nazo ("Riddles of Modern War History"), who argued in favor of 200,000. Since then the death <b>toll</b> <b>of</b> the massacre {{has been a major}} topic of discussion among historians across the world. However, emotional arguments and political interference in the debate have tended to hinder the construction of an academic consensus on the number of people killed in the atrocity.|$|E

5|$|Currently, {{the most}} {{reliable}} and widely agreed upon figures place the total death <b>toll</b> <b>of</b> the massacre between {{the broad range of}} 40,000 to 200,000 massacre victims in the entire Nanking Special Administrative District. Some individual estimates by scholars and eyewitnesses are included in the following table.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} two centuries, {{tropical}} cyclones {{have been responsible for}} the deaths of about 1.9million people worldwide. It is estimated that 10,000people per year perish due to tropical cyclones. The deadliest tropical cyclone was the 1970 Bhola cyclone, which had a death <b>toll</b> <b>of</b> anywhere from 300,000 to 500,000 lives.|$|E
5|$|Exact French {{casualties}} {{are difficult}} to calculate, but of the 1,300 aboard Droits de l'Homme, 103 {{are known to have}} died in the battle and just over 300 were saved from the wreck, indicating the deaths of approximately 900men on the French ship between the morning of 14January and the morning of 18January. However, a French source suggests that up to another 500 of the crew were rescued from the wreck by the corvette Arrogante and the cutter Aiguille on 17 and 18 January. This would give a <b>toll</b> <b>of</b> only about 400. A menhir at Ploz√©vet, with an inscription carved in 1840 gives a death <b>toll</b> <b>of</b> six hundred.|$|E

5|$|The total death <b>toll</b> <b>of</b> the Nanking Massacre is {{a highly}} {{contentious}} subject in Chinese and Japanese historiography. Following {{the outbreak of the}} Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese Imperial Army marched from Shanghai to the Chinese capital city of Nanking, and though a large number of Chinese POWs and civilians were slaughtered by the Japanese following their entrance into Nanking on December 13, 1937, the precise number remains unknown. Since the late-1960s when the first academic works on the Nanking Massacre were produced, estimating the approximate death <b>toll</b> <b>of</b> the massacre has been a major topic of scholarly debate.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} types Asian and African megafauna, the Javan rhino was relentlessly hunted by trophy and big-game hunters for decades {{following}} {{the arrival of}} Europeans in its range. The rhinos being easy targets, this was as severe a contributor to its decline as was poaching for its horns.

The Philippine Red Cross reported that 207people died on land in the Philippines, which was slightly lower than the agency's earlier reports suggesting a death <b>toll</b> <b>of</b> 233. Nationwide, damage to infrastructure totaled $228million (1988 USD) and damage to agriculture totaled $40million. Across the Philippines, damage totaled $268million.|$|E

This {{was the first}} major crash of a civil airliner in France since the crash of Air France Flight 4590 on takeoff from Charles de Gaulle Airport in 2000.

5|$|The {{pressure}} of the separation and constant press attention began to take its <b>toll</b> <b>of</b> Carey. Growing creative differences with producer Walter Afanasieff ended their working relationship, after collaborating on most of Carey's previous output. The breaking point came after a heated argument during a long recording session, over the album's musical direction. Carey also faced media criticism over her choice of producers and several newspapers linked Carey romantically to several rappers, suggesting these relationships influenced her decisions. However, Carey denied the allegations, stating she had only slept with her husband.|$|E
