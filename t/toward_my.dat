25|$|I, Liliuokalani of Hawaii, by {{the will}} of God named heir {{apparent}} on the tenth day of April, A.D. 1877, and {{by the grace of}} God Queen of the Hawaiian Islands on the seventeenth day of January, A.D. 1893, do hereby protest against the ratification of a certain treaty, which, so I am informed, has been signed at Washington by Messrs. Hatch, Thurston, and Kinney, purporting to cede those Islands to the territory and dominion of the United States. I declare such a treaty to be an act of wrong toward the native and part-native people of Hawaii, an invasion of the rights of the ruling chiefs, in violation of international rights both <b>toward</b> <b>my</b> people and toward friendly nations with whom they have made treaties, the perpetuation of the fraud whereby the constitutional government was overthrown, and, finally, an act of gross injustice to me.|$|E

500|$|John Albert Taylor {{was born}} in Ogden, Utah to Albert and Gaylene Taylor, who {{separated}} during his infancy. He moved several times during his youth, including a move to Colorado {{at the age of}} nine, when he was told that his father had died. According to Taylor, he was raised in Florida, where he was abused as a child and became involved in drugs by his teens. Taylor stated that he did not get along with his stepfather, a Vietnam veteran, or his mother: [...] "But she could never control me. My mother had a lot of animosity <b>toward</b> <b>my</b> father. They alienated me for a long time. I was the whipping post." [...] At the age of 13, he stabbed his stepfather. According to court records, he repeatedly raped and sodomized his sister Laurie during his teens, and raped, and sodomized other young girls, and was committed to a sex offender program. In 1974, Taylor moved back to Ogden to live with his grandmother, but soon returned to Florida.|$|E

2500|$|On January 7, 1942, Ford wrote {{a letter}} to Sigmund Livingston as the Founder and National Chairman of the Anti-Defamation League. [...] The purpose of the letter was to clarify some general misconceptions that he subscribed or {{supported}} directly or indirectly, “any agitation which would promote antagonism <b>toward</b> <b>my</b> Jewish fellow citizens.” [...] He concluded the letter with “My sincere hope that now in this country and throughout the world when the war is finished, hatred of the Jews and hatred against any other racial or religious groups shall cease for all time.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite the rider's {{positive}} {{test result}} relating to a pre-Tour training camp, Sinkewitz {{competed in the}} race until Stage 8, when he collided with a spectator and withdrew from the event, {{at which point the}} test result emerged. Sinkewitz initially denied the allegation and called for his B sample to be tested. German television withdrew from covering the Tour in protest when his positive test came to light. On 31 July Sinkewitz subsequently retracted his denial and confessed to using a testosterone gel on his upper arms whilst training. Accepting the positive test result, Sinkewitz stated that: [...] "It was a big mistake and irresponsible <b>toward</b> <b>my</b> team, colleagues, the sponsor and the whole of cycling." [...] T-Mobile responded to the admission by sacking Sinkewitz with immediate effect.|$|E
2500|$|My Own Prison was remixed, given a more radio-friendly sound, and re-{{released}} by Wind-up Records. Four singles {{were released}} from the album: [...] "My Own Prison", [...] "Torn", [...] "What's This Life For", and [...] "One". Each of these songs reached No.1 on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, making Creed the first band to accomplish such a feat with a debut album. With little MTV exposure, media coverage, or label support, My Own Prison sold extremely well, moving over six million copies and going six times platinum. Creed continued to top year-end charts and was recognized as the Rock Artist of the Year at the 1998 Billboard Music Awards. My Own Prison was also the highest-selling heavy music record of 1998 on Nielsen SoundScan's Hard Music chart. The band's hit song [...] "My Own Prison" [...] was also featured as a live performance on the charity album Live in the X Lounge. The band covered Alice Cooper's song [...] "I'm Eighteen" [...] for The Faculty soundtrack in 1998. Critical reception <b>toward</b> <b>My</b> Own Prison was mostly favorable. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave it {{four out of five}} stars and said that Creed [...] "work well within their chicken tender dinner" [...] despite [...] "basically [...] into the category of post-Seattle bands who temper their grunge with a dose of Live earnestness." [...] The album lyrically deals with themes of questioning and struggling with faith and spirituality.|$|E
