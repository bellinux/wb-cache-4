Sometimes, the attendants also hold severed heads (not their own). While Dakini is fair, Varnini is red-complexioned. In other depictions, both {{are depicted}} blue-grey.

5|$|Decorating of the Bride {{is one of}} Jovanović's Orientalist works, notable {{examples}} of which include The Wounded Montenegrin (1882), Fencing Lesson (1883) and Cockfight (1897). The painting is undated, and it remains unknown exactly when it was composed. Petar Petrović, the curator of the National Museum of Serbia, dates it to ca. 1885–86. Art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson writes that it was painted in 1888. What is known for certain is that Jovanović painted it in the mid-1880s {{on one of his}} travels through the Balkans. One source contends that it was composed while the artist was visiting the Ottoman town of Shkodër, in present-day Albania. Another version of the painting {{is said to have been}} created by the artist not long after the original, but is considered lost. An 1891 journal article describes this version as depicting two women decorating the bride, while <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> the bride's mother clasps her hands and cries with joy. This version is said to have shown a girl on the verge of tears standing by a door to the far left. On the right, a woman and young girl could be seen offering gifts to the bride. During conservatory examinations in 2009, it was discovered that Decorating of the Bride had been painted over a similar, earlier work. The artist appears to have shortened the right side of the canvas by about , altered the appearance of the interior, and slightly modified the left side of the painting. Save for the shortened canvas length, the right side of the painting is identical to that in the final version.|$|E

25|$|La Femme aux Phlox is an oil {{on canvas}} with {{dimensions}} 81 x 100cm (31 by 39 inches) signed and dated 'Alb Gleizes 10'. Created {{during the second half}} of 1910, the painting represents a woman sitting in an interior setting, with a vase of flowers (phloxes) in front and another <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>left.</b> The window behind the sitter opens out onto an exterior scene, the whole blurring the distinction between interior and exterior.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominating}} {{central figure}} {{is flanked by}} a woman <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> and another to the right, positioned slightly behind. Two of the women are holding drapery that flows rigidly down to their legs {{to the base of}} the sculpture. The figures are constructed with a robust, muscular build, distilled in the form of almost androgynous stature, together forming a tight cohesive mass. The heads and features of the figures, seen in both profile and frontal views, are treated as a series of faceted planar forms that communicated in a strange novel 3-dimensional language; one that at the time broke away from every natural and rational convention.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, {{the human}} pyramid {{to the right}} has a {{vigorous}} vertical thrust. The writhing of the woman tied to the horse, the upward reaching stretch of the figure <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>left,</b> the shocking mane of the horse, and the twisting and commanding figure of the soldier upon it, all give dynamism to the grouping as it rises. But {{at the foot of}} the pyramid, an old woman raises her head to gaze into the sky, and to her right a baby seeks maternal comfort from a clenched-fisted corpse. Body parts including a hand and forearm, and an indistinct, congealed bloody mass hover grimly above the infant.|$|E
25|$|During the {{off-season}} in 2016, going into 2017, Kvitová announced Jiří Vaněk as her new coach.

She was initially expected to be sidelined for six months, but following good progress in her recovery, Kvitová announced in late May that she would return to competition at the French Open, a month ahead of schedule.

In {{contrast}} with the complete darkness of the house behind her, she carries a lit lantern and wears a dark but colourful patterned kimono. Beyond the figure of Osome herself, there is very little detail. The ground is made up of yellow horizontal lines on a brown background, and the sky is coloured with the bokashi technique of colour gradation, darkening from light grey to black as it reaches the top edge of the print. Osome looks up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> with an uneasy facial expression, her gaze resting somewhere beyond the right border of the print.|$|E
