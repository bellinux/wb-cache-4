5|$|Alexander Stuart, an Army {{captain who}} served as the last {{governor}} of the castle, stripped down what remained of the fortification in the mid-1700s. Some of the stone was reused to build the Bowling Green House – later renamed the Castle Inn – on <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tennis courts, while {{the north side of the}} outer bailey was used to make the bowling green itself. Stuart lived in a house in Ludlow itself, but decorated the Great Hall with the remains of the castle armoury, and may have charged visitors for admittance.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small {{courtyard}} is {{a chapel}} {{and at the}} southern end is an esplanade.

Lining the west of the courtyard is the hall of the Knights. Though probably first built in the 12thcentury, the interior dates from the 13th-century remodelling. The tracery and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of Gothic architecture, probably dating from the 1230s.|$|E

5|$|Hilton Head Island is {{sometimes}} referred to as the second largest barrier island on the Eastern Seaboard after Long Island (which is not actually a barrier island but two glacial moraines). Technically, however, Hilton Head Island is only a half barrier island. <b>The</b> <b>north</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island is a sea island dating to the Pleistocene epoch, and the south end is a barrier island that appeared as recently as the Holocene epoch. Broad Creek, which is actually a land-locked tidal marsh, separates the two halves of the island.|$|E

The south end of the steam railway was at the east end of the Stark Street ferry between Portland and East Portland on the Willamette River. <b>The</b> <b>north</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line was at a landing on the Columbia that served ferries traveling between Oregon and Vancouver, Washington.|$|E
