5|$|The military's anti-venereal disease {{campaign}} {{marked a}} major <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> <b>for</b> the movement: {{it was the}} first time a government institution had engaged in a sustained, public discussion of sexual matters.

This was the first time a U.S. government institution had engaged in a sustained, public discussion of sexual matters; as a consequence, contraception transformed from an issue of morals to an issue of public health.|$|E

The location {{and value of}} offset target, in terms of f 0 <b>turning</b> <b>point,</b> peak and valley, relative to the tonebearing syllable was studied. Corpus was sentences with five syllables. Tonal values of the second, third, and fourth syllables in these sentences were varied, while the tonal values of first and fifth (final) syllables were controlled. F 0 data were extracted from 5 %, 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 % and 95 % points into the duration of second, third and fourth syllables. Results showed that f 0 <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> <b>for</b> HH and MM tones located before offset boundaries of {{the second and third}} syllables; f 0 targets for LH, HL and ML tones at the second syllables located after the offset boundaries. The <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> <b>for</b> HH tone in the penultimate syllables occurred after the offset boundaries, while the <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> <b>for</b> MM tone occurred before the boundaries. At the penultimate and antepenultimate syllables, the location of offset targets of HL and ML tones depended on the following tonal onsets. When followed by M onset, the targets occurred after the offset boundary of the syllables; when followed by H onset, the tonal targets occurred before the boundaries.

Inness Hartler and Herbert Atkins, making this his introduction to the role of a mentor. During this expedition, Beebe was also amazed to discover the number and variety of organisms living under a single tree, and pioneered the method of studying a small area of wilderness for an extended amount of time. This expedition marked the beginning of a shift for Beebe from ornithology to the study of tropical ecosystems.|$|E

The <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> <b>for</b> their relationship occurred when they married on June 18, 1912 in Gunsbach. At this point in their lives, they both decided to marry and go to Africa to fulfill their desire to care for others in need.

On Good Friday of 1913, she travelled with Albert to Lambaréné, Gabon, beginning her medical missionary adventure.|$|E
5|$|Henry Ward Beecher became {{involved}} in many social issues of his day, most notably abolition. Though Beecher hated slavery as early as his seminary days, his views were generally more moderate than those of abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison, who advocated {{the breakup of the}} Union if it would also mean the end of slavery. A personal <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> <b>for</b> Beecher came in October 1848 when he learned of two escaped young female slaves who had been recaptured; their father had been offered the chance to ransom them from captivity, and appealed to Beecher to help raise funds. Beecher raised over two thousand dollars to secure the girls' freedom. On June 1, 1856, he held another mock slave auction to purchase the freedom of a young woman named Sarah.|$|E

With Capcom as publisher, Killer7 was his first game to be released outside Japan. While its sales were not up to Capcom's standards, the game's cult success encouraged the director to remake two of his older Japan-only games, The Silver Case and Flower, Sun, and Rain, for Western release. It also allowed his next major title, No More Heroes, to be released to critical and commercial success. The game also cemented Suda51's status as an auteur video game director.

5|$|Asad's {{resolution}} in confronting the khagan, and the wise strategic choice of making Balkh his residence, paid off, and {{allowed him to}} salvage a situation that, {{in the wake of}} several defeats {{at the hands of the}} Turgesh, appeared seemingly hopeless—indeed, Caliph Hisham is said to have been incredulous at the first news of Asad's victory. The victory at Kharistan consolidated the Arab position in Khurasan, and particularly in Tokharistan, where the local rulers would certainly have gone over to the Turgesh if the latter had won or remained unopposed. Conversely the defeat diminished the prestige of Suluk, and may possibly have played a role in his assassination early in 738, although rivalries between the Turgesh, fanned by the Chinese court, were more directly responsible for it. The Turgesh khaganate then collapsed into infighting, and stopped being a serious threat to Arab interests in the area. As a result, the Battle of Kharistan is considered a <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> <b>for</b> the Arab fortunes in Central Asia.|$|E
