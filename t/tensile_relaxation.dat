40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. <b>Tensile</b> <b>relaxation</b> is an {{important}} property in structural concrete members such as concrete overlays and patch repairs under sustained imposed restraint. <b>Tensile</b> <b>relaxation</b> helps in reducing tensile stresses in concrete which leads to mitigation of cracking in restrained concrete members. Normally, {{it is assumed that}} <b>tensile</b> <b>relaxation</b> is influenced in a similar way by the same parameters that influence creep despite potential differences between the two. Moreover, relaxation is predicted from functions that link it to creep. Whereas it is easy to find published literature on creep of concrete, little {{can be found on the}} relaxation behaviour of concrete. More research is therefore needed to understand the factors that influence relaxation and its prediction. This study aimed at comparing the influence of selected factors on creep and relaxation to establish a correlation if any between the two. The parameters investigated include: w/c ratio, age of loading, initial stress-strength ratio and aggregate content. <b>Tensile</b> <b>relaxation</b> tests are difficult to perform and hence prediction models are often relied upon to predict relaxation. Two simplified approximate methods are suggested in the fib Model Code to obtain the relaxation function from the creep function. The Age Adjusted Effective Modulus method (AAEM) given in the MC 2010 and the Approximate Relaxation Function (ARF) in MC 90 - 93 are mentioned. Values from the two were compared with experimental relaxation results to verify their accuracy in predicting the relaxation potential of selected concretes. Results show that <b>tensile</b> <b>relaxation</b> of concrete, similar to creep is affected by parameters such as w/c ratio, age of loading and aggregate content. It is observed that the magnitude of <b>tensile</b> <b>relaxation,</b> with other factors held constant, was found to reduce with a reduction in w/c ratio, increase in age and increase in aggregate content. The initial stress-strength ratio does not seem to have a significant influence on relaxation. However, an increase in the initial stress leads to a small and un- proportional increase in relaxation. The use of models linking the creep function and relaxation function to predict low-age relaxation is probably valid. Although both the AAEM and ARF methods yield fairly good predictions of relaxation, the simplicity of the AAEM makes it a better option...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Concrete {{structures}} {{are designed with}} a specific service life in mind and deteriorate over time due to their exposure to environmental conditions. In order to increase the service life of concrete structures, they can sometimes be rehabilitated and repaired using concrete overlays. However, problems may develop between the new and old concrete due to differential shrinkage between the concrete substrate and overlay. These differential shrinkages typically result in the build - up of tensile stresses within the overlay. If the concrete does not possess sufficient tensile strength, the overlay will crack and or delaminate, which is usually considered failure. To prevent cracking, the quantity of shrinkage that occurs in the overlay needs to be minimised. Literature suggests that the addition of superabsorbent polymers (SAP's) to the concrete overlay can reduce the total shrinkage that occurs. A large amount of research exists pertaining to the use on SAP's in high performance concrete (HPC), while very {{little research has been}} done regarding their influence of overlays. This research investigated how the addition of SAP's to overlays containing silica fume (SF) would improve bonded concrete overlay performance. Testing was conducted on overlay samples with a water:binder (W/b) ratio of 0. 45 and 0. 55 with SAP contents of containing 0 %, 0. 2 %, 0. 4 % and 0. 6 % of the total binder content. Samples were subjected to a large number of tests including compressive, tensile and shear bond strength, durability, <b>tensile</b> <b>relaxation,</b> elastic modulus, carbonation, bulk diffusion and free and restrained shrinkage. The results of this research indicate d that the SAP's had a greater influence on samples with a higher w/b ratio. The results also suggested that an increase in SAP content resulted in improved tensile strength, <b>tensile</b> <b>relaxation</b> and durability while also reducing the rate of drying shrinkage at early ages. This indicated that SAP's can be used in mix design to improve bonded concrete overlay performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{effective}} and comprehensive repair techniques is increasing {{throughout the world}} as existing concrete structures continue to age. The bonded concrete overlay method, where a new repair material layer is cast over an existing damaged substrate, is the most commonly utilized method of repair. However, this repair technique is prone to failure due to differential volume changes between the newly cast repair material and the existing substrate. These volume changes {{can be attributed to}} thermal and shrinkage differences, with drying shrinkage being identified as they key source of the volume change. When the resulting induced stress form the differential volume changes exceeds the intrinsic tensile strength of the repair material, cracking failure occurs. This can be detrimental to the effectiveness of the repair and its durability. Overlay crack resistance {{has been found to be}} dependent on specific material properties, namely: tensile strength, elastic modulus and shrinkage. The effect of <b>tensile</b> <b>relaxation</b> on overlay performance is also significant, with the resulting 'stress relief' cause by this relaxation prolonging the time to cracking failure. In this investigation, the influence of the inclusion of coarse aggregate in the repair material is investigated. The study focuses on the specific impact of coarse aggregate volume content and size on the performance of bonded overlay materials, and the material properties that influence this performance. Two laboratory concrete mixes, with a w:c = 0. 45 and 0. 6, and a commercial repair product were tested with varying coarse aggregate volume contents. Further testing was conducted with w:c = 0. 6 laboratory mixes with different nominal sized coarse aggregates. The impact of coarse aggregate volume and size on individual material properties, which included tensile strength, <b>tensile</b> <b>relaxation,</b> free drying shrinkage and elastic modulus, were tested separately for the various mixes. In conjunction with this, direct restrained shrinkage tests were conducted using ring tests to measure the influence of coarse aggregate volume and size on the time to cracking failure and crack intensity of the repair materials...|$|E

A polymer {{is treated as}} an ensemble of cooperatively relaxing regions (CRR) which rearrange at random times as they are thermally agitated. Rearrangement of CRRs reflects the viscoelastic response of the bulk medium. At low stresses, CRRs are connected with each other, which implies that the macro-strain in a specimen coincides with micro-strains in individual relaxing regions. When the average stress exceeds some threshold level, links between CRRs break and relaxing domains begin to slide one with respect to another.

40|$|Constitutive {{equations}} {{are derived}} for the viscoelastic behavior of filled elastomers at isothermal loading with finite strains. A particle-reinforced rubber is {{thought of as}} a composite where regions with low concentrations of junctions between chains are randomly distributed in the bulk material. The onset of these inclusions is associated with the inhomogeneity in spatial distribution of a cross-linker during the mixing process. With reference to the theory of transient networks, the time-dependent response of an elastomer is modelled as thermally activated processes of breakage and reformation of chains in domains with low concentrations of junctions, whereas junctions in the bulk medium are treated as permanent. Stress-strain relations are developed by using the laws of thermodynamics. Adjustable parameters in the constitutive equations are found by fitting experimental data in <b>tensile</b> <b>relaxation</b> tests for several grades of unfilled and carbon black filled natural rubber. It is demonstrated that (i) the average relaxation time noticeably grows with the elongation ratio, which is explained by mechanically-induced crystallization of strands, and (ii) the relaxation spectrum of a filled elastomer is not affected by mechanical pre-loading and thermal recovery at elevated temperatures.
