5|$|A {{controversial}} fumble recovery by Sewanee {{may have}} saved the game. Auburn quarterback Reynolds Tichenor {{said it was a}} gift; the referee awarded Sewanee the ball, but he insisted Auburn recovered it. A double pass play to Warbler Wilson got the ensuing Sewanee touchdown. Bart Sims made the extra point <b>to</b> <b>edge</b> Auburn. Neither team managed to score in the second half. The delay from the crowd gathering on the field ran the game into darkness.|$|E

5|$|A heated {{confrontation}} between Randy Orton and Edge was seen, with Edge spearing Orton. The following week, {{it was announced}} that Orton would defend the Intercontinental Championship against Edge at Vengeance. Weeks leading to the event, both men took the upper hand over one another. At the scheduled event, Orton lost the Intercontinental Championship <b>to</b> <b>Edge.</b>|$|E

At The Bash, the duo {{dropped the}} Unified Tag Team Titles <b>to</b> <b>Edge</b> and Chris Jericho in a Triple Threat Tag Team Match also {{involving}} Ted DiBiase and Cody Rhodes. Carlito and Primo invoked their rematch clause the next night on Raw, but were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|A Big Ten Conference preseason media poll, {{announced}} at its October 31 media-day conference, predicted that Michigan would finish second to rival Michigan State (ahead of Ohio State) and selected McGary and Robinson for its preseason All-Big Ten team. A Big Ten Network media poll, announced {{the day before}} and providing additional detail, also selected McGary and Robinson for its All-Big Ten Conference team. McGary and Robinson were on the 50-man Naismith Award and Wooden Award preseason watchlists. A poll of Big Ten beat writers also selected Michigan <b>to</b> <b>edge</b> out Ohio State for second place. Michigan began the season ninth in the preseason Coaches' Poll and seventh in the AP Poll.|$|E
5|$|Cena {{lost the}} {{championship}} back <b>to</b> <b>Edge</b> in a Last Man Standing match at Backlash after interference from Big Show, who chokeslammed Cena through a big spotlight. This resulted in Cena beginning a feud with Big Show in which Cena defeated Big Show at Judgment Day and at Extreme Rules in a submission match {{by applying the}} STFU. During Cena's feud with Big Show, The Miz challenged him to a match on the April 27 episode of Raw, but as Cena was out due to injury, Miz claimed an unofficial win via forfeit and continued to do this over the following weeks, until Cena defeated him in a singles match at The Bash.|$|E

5|$|Cena {{made his}} in-ring return at the November {{pay-per-view}} event, Survivor Series, defeating Chris Jericho {{to win his}} first World Heavyweight Championship. The two continued their rivalry up to Armageddon, where Cena retained his championship. After defeating JBL at the Royal Rumble, Cena lost the championship at No Way Out <b>to</b> <b>Edge,</b> after Kofi Kingston was attacked by Edge, who took {{his place in the}} Elimination Chamber match. Cena was given an opportunity to regain the title at WrestleMania XXV in a triple threat match also involving Big Show, which Cena won.|$|E

The arena is mainly used for athletics, as well as functions for: North West Counties Football League side Wigan Robin Park, and Wigan Athletic Reserves. The arena was formerly used by the Wigan Warriors' junior academy, before they moved <b>to</b> <b>Edge</b> Hall Road to join the reserve side. Robin Park Sports Centre is situated directly opposite the Stadium and Arena.|$|E
5|$|On the July 6 {{episode of}} Raw, {{following}} their loss <b>to</b> <b>Edge</b> and Jericho, Carlito turned heel by attacking Primo. At Night of Champions, Carlito challenged for the United States Championship in a Six-Pack Challenge, which also involved Primo, {{but neither of}} them were able to win the title. On the August 3 episode of Raw, Carlito defeated Primo to end their feud. On the August 13 episode of WWE Superstars, Carlito teamed with Rosa Mendes to defeat Kofi Kingston and Mickie James. Mendes would then become Carlito's manager until she {{was traded to the}} ECW brand in September.|$|E

The next month at WrestleMania X-Seven, the Hardy Boyz competed in another TLC match against Edge and Christian and the Dudley Boyz. Just as in the first TLC match, Edge and Christian were victorious thanks to help from Rhyno.|$|E
5|$|Several months later, the Oregon's women's program {{entered the}} NCAA Outdoor National Championship meet as {{favorites}} {{to win the}} title. Despite losing a key runner to injury, a disqualification in the 4x100m, and adversity during the meet, the Oregon women's team was able <b>to</b> <b>edge</b> out the Georgia Bulldogs's strong field events team in the final 4x400m event. Since the women's team won the cross country championship and the indoor championship in the same academic year, the outdoor title gave the women's team a triple crown, the first time any NCAA women's track and field team has accomplished this feat.|$|E
5|$|The Wolfpack {{lost its}} fourth {{straight}} game {{to remain the}} only ACC team winless in conference play (ACC: 0–4). The favorite Terrapins once again struggled against an underdog opponent, but managed <b>to</b> <b>edge</b> the Wolfpack and secure a sixth win for bowl eligibility. With it, Maryland was ranked {{for the first time}} since 2006, at 25th on the Associated Press and USA Today Coaches' Poll rankings. Interestingly, the fan poll ESPNU Allstate Standings had the Terrapins ranked 14th in the nation, ahead of AP first-ranked Texas and fourth-ranked Oklahoma.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was John Cena against Edge, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels in a Fatal Four-Way {{match for the}} WWE Championship. During the opening minutes of the match, Michaels {{performed}} a moonsault from the top turnbuckle onto Cena, Edge, and Orton outside the ring. Near the end, Orton attempted to RKO Cena, but was pushed into Edge, making Edge Spear Orton. Cena then performed an FU <b>to</b> <b>Edge.</b> When Cena turned around, Michaels superkicked Cena, who landed on Orton for the pinfall victory, retaining the title.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} Edge against Batista in a Steel Cage {{match for the}} World Heavyweight Championship, which could be won by pinfall, submission, or {{escaping}} the cage. During {{the first few minutes}} of the contest, Edge attempted to escape the cage many times but Batista stopped him and gained the advantage after a suplex <b>to</b> <b>Edge</b> off the top rope. Edge gained the upper hand late in the contest, performing a spear to Batista, but didn't get the pinfall. Batista regained the advantage and attempted the Batista Bomb, but Edge reversed the move. Edge climbed {{over the top of the}} cage while Batista crawled towards the door. Edge's feet hit the arena floor first, and he was declared the winner and retained his title.|$|E
5|$|To {{counter the}} depredations from Cherbourg, the Admiralty {{despatched}} {{a number of}} warships to blockade the French coast, including the 36-gun frigate HMS Crescent under Captain James Saumarez, which was sent from Portsmouth to the Channel Islands before operating off the Cotentin. On 19 October, Saumarez learned of the French routine and took up a station close inshore near Cape Barfleur, a rocky headland on the eastern extremity of the Cotentin Peninsula which the Cherbourg raiders passed whenever leaving or entering port. At dawn on 20 October lookouts on Crescent reported two sails approaching the land from the Channel, one significantly larger than the other. Saumarez immediately ordered his ship <b>to</b> <b>edge</b> into the wind towards the strange vessels and rapidly {{came up on the}} port side of the new arrivals, with the wind behind him allowing freedom of movement.|$|E

Green vertex 1,3 is adjacent to three other green vertices: 1,4 and 1,2 (corresponding <b>to</b> <b>edges</b> sharing the endpoint 1 in the blue graph) and 4,3 (corresponding <b>to</b> an <b>edge</b> sharing the endpoint 3 in the blue graph).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{restrictions}} {{of both the}} harmonic functions and the eigenfunctions of the symmetric Laplacian <b>to</b> <b>edges</b> of pre-gaskets contained in the Sierpinski gasket. For a harmonic function, its restriction <b>to</b> any <b>edge</b> is either monotone or having a single extremum. For an eigenfunction, it may have several local extrema along edges. We prove general criteria, involving the values of any given function at the endpoints and midpoint of any <b>edge,</b> <b>to</b> determine which case it should be, {{as well as the}} asymptotic behavior of the restriction near the endpoints. Moreover, for eigenfunctions, we use spectral decimation to calculate the exact number of the local extrema along any edge. This confirm, in a more general situation, a conjecture of K. Dalrymple, R. S. Strichartz and J. P. Vinson DSV on the behavior of the restrictions <b>to</b> <b>edges</b> of the basis Dirichlet eigenfunctions, suggested by the numerical data.
