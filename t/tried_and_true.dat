25|$|The Camden and Amboy Rail Road and Transportation Company (C) was {{chartered}} on February 4, 1830, on {{the same}} day as the Delaware and Raritan Canal Company, after the two competing companies had come to a compromise. The C and D had the same goals — to connect the Delaware River, serving Philadelphia, with the Raritan River, for access to New York City — one by <b>tried</b> <b>and</b> <b>true</b> tow-path canal with some new innovations to cross the hills and the other by the novel & as yet untried railroad technology then emerging in Europe. Both ventures were considered risky, and both needed right-of-way grants from the legislature along the river's banks, requiring negotiations and design compromises before either could lay claim to a land rights charter.|$|E

25|$|In the <b>tried</b> <b>and</b> <b>true</b> way of {{all major}} labels at the time, {{they really wanted}} to sign Dave but got a {{troublesome}} band instead. It was probably Island's insistence that Alsy and Marty weren't up to it that caused the Craig Leon sessions to be the unmitigated disaster that they were. Now I could be wrong here, maybe Craig wanted them out, maybe both. We were pretty much forced to let a couple of session guys stand in – no names because it wasn't their fault – and we could tell straight away that this was applying a straightener to the normally unruly quiff that was the band. It was also sucking the essence of the band out. Anyway, it's a sorry little interlude that I should draw the curtain on. The sessions were scrapped and we were allowed to be The Triffids again.|$|E
500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "Lucy Doesn't Love You", uses 1960s-style horns with [...] "jangly guitars" [...] to {{reintroduce}} Ivy's signature indie pop style into the album. It has a [...] "sassy brass and lifting melody," [...] accompanied by electric guitars {{to create an}} [...] "atmospheric" [...] mood. According to Tom Topkoff of Hybrid Magazine, [...] "Worry About You" [...] is Ivy's [...] "furthest departure from their <b>tried</b> <b>and</b> <b>true</b> practice". The composition is relatively ambient, with [...] "Portishead styled ethereal-dub characteristics". [...] "Let's Stay Inside", the album's eighth song, uses keyboard and acoustic guitar instrumentation to provide a [...] "comforting" [...] feeling; [...] "bossa nova-tinged", it results in an [...] "intimate approach".

500|$|Wilco guitarist Jay Bennett {{recorded}} the entire album with Chris Brickley, and agreed with Tweedy that O'Rourke {{would be a}} good choice to mix the album, after a failed attempt by Bennett and Brickley to mix a few of the songs at CRC and after hearing O'Rourke's [...] "audition mix". One of the conflicts, exhibited in the film , was over the ten-second transition between [...] "Ashes of American Flags" [...] and [...] "Heavy Metal Drummer". Bennett attempted to explain to Tweedy that there were several slightly different ways to approach the transition, each of which would yield slightly different results, but Tweedy explained that he just wanted the problem fixed, and was not concerned with understanding the different approaches. Bennett focused on the individual songs, while Tweedy focused on larger conceptual and thematic issues—a <b>tried</b> <b>and</b> <b>true</b> division of labor that had worked well on the four releases on which they co-wrote the material. In order to achieve the band's musical goals, Tweedy invited Jim O'Rourke into the studio to mix [...] "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart" [...] (...) , and the results impressed the band members. O'Rourke was then asked to mix the rest of the album.|$|E

However, Scott relied chiefly on man-hauling in 1911–12 because ponies could not ascend the glacier midway to the Pole. The Norwegians correctly estimated that dog teams could go all the way. Furthermore, they used a simple plan, based on their native skill with skis and on dog-driving methods that were <b>tried</b> <b>and</b> <b>true.</b> In a similar fashion to the way the moon was reached by expending a succession of rocket stages and then casting each aside; the Norwegians used the same strategy, sacrificing the weaker animals along the journey to feed the other animals and the men themselves." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another Civil Rights {{activist who}} was charged and {{convicted in the}} Lazy B Stables case was Dr. James Earl Grant, a {{dedicated}} activist against racial discrimination. Though Grant was from Hartford, Connecticut and received his doctorate degree from Penn State, he was very active in the South's racial playing field, especially that of North Carolina's. On May 11, 1970, three white males murdered a black man, Henry Marrow, a father of three children who lived in Oxford, North Carolina. When news spread that Henry had been murdered, Blacks from across the country, along with Grant, decided they were fed up and organized protests. Most wanted to obtain justice through the <b>tried</b> <b>and</b> <b>true</b> legal system, however a group of [...] "black Vietnam veterans" [...] took {{matters into their own}} hands and decided to bomb white businesses in Oxford.

2500|$|In April 2006, Reuel Marc Gerecht, {{a former}} Middle East {{specialist}} at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), presented a list {{of those who had}} 'mysteriously' died during Putin's presidency and wrote: [...] "Vladimir Putin's Russia is a new phenomenon in Europe: a state defined and dominated by former and active-duty security and intelligence officers. Not even fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, or the Soviet Union – all undoubtedly much worse creations than Russia – were as top-heavy with intelligence talent. <...> There is no historical precedent for a society so dominated by former and active-duty internal-security and intelligence officials – men who rose up in a professional culture in which murder could be an acceptable, even obligatory, business practice. <...> Those who operated within the Soviet sphere were the most malevolent in their practices. These men mentored and shaped Putin and his closest friends and allies. It is therefore unsurprising that Putin's Russia has become an assassination-happy state where detention, interrogation, and torture – all <b>tried</b> <b>and</b> <b>true</b> methods of the Soviet KGB – are used to silence the voices of untoward journalists and businessmen who annoy or threaten Putin's FSB state." ...|$|E

There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer.

5000|$|Jury nullification is {{the source}} of much debate. Some {{maintain}} that it is an important safeguard of last resort against wrongful imprisonment and government tyranny. Others view it as a violation of the right to a jury trial, which undermines the law. Some view it as a violation of the oath sworn by jurors. In the United States, some view the requirement that jurors take an oath to be unlawful in itself, while still others view the oath's reference to [...] "deliverance" [...] to require nullification of unjust law: [...] "will well <b>and</b> truly <b>try</b> <b>and</b> a <b>true</b> deliverance make between the United States and the defendant at the bar, <b>and</b> a <b>true</b> verdict render according to the evidence, so help me God." [...] Some fear that nullification could be used to permit violence against socially unpopular factions. They point to the danger that a jury may choose to convict a defendant who has not broken the letter of the law. However, judges retain the rights both to decide sentences and to disregard juries' guilty verdicts, acting as a check against malicious juries. Jury nullification may also occur in civil suits, in which the verdict is generally a finding of liability or lack of liability (rather than a finding of guilty or not guilty).|$|R

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 84, based on six reviews. AllMusic's Andy Kellman called it [...] "one of the year’s best R albums" [...] and complimented its [...] "sweet love songs — pleasurable, fresh updates of his <b>tried</b> <b>and</b> <b>true</b> approach", adding that DeBarge's voice [...] "remains capable of elevating substandard material, {{not that there}} is much of it here". Entertainment Weeklys Mikael Wood commented that [...] "his ethereal vocals still shimmer so effortlessly", and called it [...] "the year's most elegant tell-all". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "DeBarge simply soars, his feather-light vocals still in top form". Steve Jones of USA Today felt that DeBarge's [...] "sweet, soaring falsetto remains intact, and he has lost none of his knack for writing catchy, romantic tunes".

2500|$|The {{concept was}} widely popularized in {{anthropology}} through the book, [...] "The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia" [...] by James C. Scott (1976). The book {{begins with a}} telling metaphor of peasants being like a man standing up to his nose in water; the smallest wave will drown him. Similarly, peasants generally live {{so close to the}} subsistence line that it takes little to destroy their livelihoods. From this, he infers a set of economic principles that it would be rational for them to live by. It is important to emphasize that this book was not based on fieldwork, and itself proposed a cross-cultural universalistic model of peasant economic behaviour based upon a set of fixed theoretical principles, not a reading of peasant culture. Firstly, he argued that peasants were [...] "risk averse", or, put differently, followed a [...] "safety first" [...] principle. They would not adopt risky new seeds or technologies, no matter how promising, because <b>tried</b> <b>and</b> <b>true</b> traditional methods had demonstrated, not promised, effectiveness. This gives peasants an unfair reputation as [...] "traditionalist" [...] when in fact they are just risk averse. Secondly, Scott argues that peasant society provides [...] "subsistence insurance" [...] for its members to tide them over those occasions when natural or man-made disaster strikes. Although fieldwork has not supported many of Scott's conclusions, the book encouraged a generation of researchers.|$|E
2500|$|Much of HIM's {{success has}} been {{attributed}} to vocalist and main songwriter Ville Valo. Vesa Sirén of Helsingin Sanomat described the band's music as achieving [...] "major crossover appeal" [...] by combining [...] "traditional Finnish melancholia", with [...] "gothic lyrics, walls of metal guitars, and keyboard riffs." [...] Vesterinen also singled out Valo's songwriting ability as a major component in HIM's success, stating: [...] "Charisma in something that you're somewhat born with [...] writing songs on the other hand is hard to learn, if you don't have the talent for it." [...] Juhani Merimaa also stated that with [...] "melodic, catchy and good songs", as well as being [...] "credible in the underground, and the mainstream", HIM had [...] "all the elements for breaking through". HIM also gained many fans through Valo's image, which Sirén described as utilizing [...] "the <b>tried</b> <b>and</b> <b>true</b> James Dean -formula, where sensitivity and edginess combined." [...] With all these elements, HIM garnered both male and female fans around the world, with Asko Kallonen, who first signed the band to BMG, recalling: [...] "For example in England it was hard to grasp. There the split was usually clear: hard rock was for guys, pop was for girls. HIM was listened to by both." [...] Juhani Merimaa felt similarly, stating: [...] "Unlike other metal bands, they appealed to the opposite sex." [...] Lance Teegarden of PopMatters has noted that HIM is [...] "not the sort of act that conjures up a lukewarm response [...] people either like them or discredit them outright". Some of the major criticism directed towards the band have centered around the supposed repetitive nature of their music and pandering towards teenage goth fans. HIM's association with Jackass member and skateboarder Bam Margera has also received some negative feedback.|$|E

500|$|Electrical {{systems are}} {{commonly}} described {{by means of}} a circuit diagram. [...] These are network diagrams that describe the topology of the electrical system using a specialised graph notation. [...] The circuit diagram does not <b>try</b> <b>and</b> represent the <b>true</b> physical dimensions of the electrical components or their actual spatial relationship to each other. [...] This is possible because the electrical components are represented as ideal lumped elements, that is, the element is treated as if it is occupying a single point (lumped at that point). [...] Non-ideal components can be accommodated in this model by using more than one element to represent the component. [...] For instance, a coil intended for use as an inductor has resistance as well as inductance. [...] This can be represented on the circuit diagram as a resistor in series with an inductor. [...] Thus, the first step in forming an analogy of a mechanical system is to describe it as a mechanical network in a similar way, that is, as a topological graph of ideal elements. [...] Alternative, more abstract, representations to the circuit diagram are possible, for instance the bond graph.|$|R
