5|$|Against Mid-American Conference {{opponent}} Eastern Michigan, Maryland showcased its offense, which {{scored on}} {{nine out of}} thirteen possessions. Starting <b>tailback</b> Da'Rel Scott sat out the game because of a shoulder injury suffered against California, and he was replaced by Morgan Green.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, the Hokies {{had even}} less success {{than they did}} in the air. Branden Ore, Tech's {{starting}} <b>tailback,</b> earned 42yards in 20shortrushes during the game. With a long run of eight yards, Ore was kept in check by Georgia's defense. The only other Hokie to achieve positive yardage on the ground was backup <b>tailback</b> Kenny Lewis, who only managed five yards. Glennon was sacked three times, once fumbling the ball. These sacks wiped out the 11 rushing yards he managed to gain during his scrambles for yardage. In the second quarter, Virginia Tech was aided by excellent field position, enabling them to score three offensive touchdowns. Tech's average starting field position in that quarter was the Georgia 48-yard line, allowing for easy scores even for a struggling offense.|$|E
5|$|Growing {{up in an}} athletically minded family, both Ryan and Chris were {{encouraged}} to play several sports, particularly hockey and football. Chris focused on football and ultimately joined their hometown Saskatchewan Roughriders in the Canadian Football League as a slotback. Ryan played <b>tailback</b> in football, and represented Saskatchewan as a catcher in a national youth baseball tournament, but focused on his hockey career.|$|E

5|$|Hokies <b>tailback</b> Darren Evans {{ran for a}} school-record of 253yards, and {{exceeded}} 100rushing {{yards in}} a game {{for the first time}} in his career. The Hokie defense shut down the Terrapins running game and held them to 12yards on 18carries. Maryland also proved unable or unwilling to blitz against Sean Glennon, the Tech quarterback hobbled by an ankle injury. Glennon threw for 127yards and a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{legislators have}} {{proposed}} naming {{the section of}} highway in Genesee County after University of Alabama <b>tailback</b> Mark Ingram. The state senate approved the measure on November 4, 2010, and the bill moved to the state house for approval. The bill failed to pass the state house during the session.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the halfback, {{also known as the}} <b>tailback,</b> is to carry the ball on running plays. Halfbacks may also serve as receivers. Fullbacks tend to be larger than halfbacks and {{function}} primarily as blockers, but they are sometimes used as runners in short-yardage situations and are seldom used in passing situations.|$|E
500|$|The {{northbound}} Blackwall Tunnel is {{a traffic}} bottleneck with <b>tailbacks.</b> A TfL study in 2009 {{revealed that the}} [...] approach to the northbound tunnel took around 19 minutes in rush hour traffic, or a delay of approximately 11 minutes per kilometre. To relieve the congestion, a tidal flow system was introduced in 1978, allowing northbound traffic to use the eastern tunnel. The congestion {{is not limited to}} weekday rush hours. There is often congestion with <b>tailbacks</b> at the weekends, especially on Sunday evenings.|$|R
2500|$|The M50 {{originally}} had two traffic lanes going either direction but was increased to {{three on the}} southern section, and four lanes each way between junctions on the Northern and Western sections. Transport Infrastructure Ireland also increased capacity at many of the motorway's busiest junctions by building triple-grade interchanges instead of the lower capacity roundabouts and crossroads {{that had been in}} place. The toll at the West-Link which caused huge <b>tailbacks</b> was demolished and replaced by a tag tolling system. This reduced <b>tailbacks</b> greatly.|$|R

5|$|After taking {{possession}} {{on his own}} 16-yard line, Georgia quarterback and true freshman Matthew Stafford caused the first turning point of the game as he threw an interception to Brenden Hill of Virginia Tech. Starting deep in Georgia territory, Virginia Tech was further aided by a personal foul on Georgia, which set up a first-and-goal situation for Virginia Tech on the Georgia 6-yard line. A two-yard run by Virginia Tech <b>tailback</b> Branden Ore brought the ball closer to the goal line and ended {{the first quarter of}} play.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter Alabama {{completed}} a 10-play, 58-yard drive by scoring on a two-yard run by backup <b>tailback</b> Trent Richardson. The key plays were a 15-yard pass from McElroy to Darius Hanks and a 13-yard pass from McElroy to Richardson. After an exchange of punts gave Alabama good starting position at the Auburn 45, the Tide quickly struck again with McElroy hitting tight end Colin Peek on a 33-yard touchdown pass that left the game tied 14–14 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|McCarty was {{shifted from}} playing mostly {{as a backup}} <b>tailback</b> to the fullback position, where he started all 18 regular season games. In his new position, McCarty was {{primarily}} used for blocking and remained involved on special teams and as a receiver. He continued his extremely limited role as a rusher, finishing the season with just eight carries. McCarty had 16 catches for 123 yards and two touchdowns, {{as well as a}} career-high 12 special-teams tackles.|$|E
50|$|The tunnels {{remain a}} {{bottleneck}} on the motorway. Partly due to regular <b>tailbacks</b> at the tunnels, a variable speed limit {{is in place}} between junctions 24 and 28.|$|R

5|$|The Dodgers {{traded for}} Jones {{in part to}} replace Glenn Dobbs – a star <b>tailback</b> in Brooklyn's single-wing offense – because Dobbs was {{suffering}} from injuries. Jones himself was hurt early in the 1947 season, however, when {{he was hit by}} Bill Willis of the Cleveland Browns. Injuries to his knee, hip and clavicle forced him to sit out for several weeks. He broke his hand when he returned and had to play exclusively on defense {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies' All-American <b>tailback</b> Lee Suggs had {{suffered}} a season-ending injury {{in the first game}} of the season, but freshman Kevin Jones had carried the offense for the season, and continued to perform well in the post-season Gator Bowl game. With a 5-yard run from Jones and a 55-yard pass from Grant Noel to André Davis, Tech took a 1713 lead going into the fourth quarter. But the lead quickly evaporated on a 77-yard catch and run from Chris Rix to Javon Walker.|$|E
5|$|After {{suffering}} {{an injury}} and being {{knocked out of}} Michigan's game with Nebraska (a 23–9 loss to the Cornhuskers) on October 27, Robinson returned to the lineup for the last home game of the 2012 season, a 42-17 victory over Iowa. Playing in his final game at Michigan Stadium, Robinson split his playing time between the <b>tailback,</b> quarterback, and wide receiver positions. He accounted for 122 yards, including 98 rushing yards on 13 carries and 24 receiving yards on two receptions. With the injury to the ulnar nerve in his right elbow, Robinson did not throw the ball during the game {{and was forced to}} carry the ball in his right hand.|$|E

5|$|Brown's {{first year}} at Ohio State was a success. The Buckeyes won {{all but one of}} eight games in 1941; the only loss was to Northwestern University and its star <b>tailback,</b> Otto Graham. The final game of the season was a 20–20 tie with Michigan, which the school's {{supporters}} saw as a good outcome given that Ohio State was a heavy underdog. The Buckeyes tied for second place in the Western Conference, a grouping of college teams from the Midwestern United States (now known as the Big Ten), and finished 13th in the AP Poll. Brown was fourth in balloting for national Coach of the Year.|$|E
5|$|East Carolina {{running back}} Chris Johnson {{finished}} {{the game with}} 223rushing yards, 32receiving yards, and 153return yards {{for a total of}} 408all-purpose yards. That mark broke the NCAA bowl record for all-purpose yards previously set by Alabama's Sherman Williams against Ohio State in the 1995 Citrus Bowl. On the basis of his record-setting performance, Johnson was named the game's Most Valuable Player. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, Boise State <b>tailback</b> Jeremy Avery had a solid, if unspectacular, outing. He produced 69rushing yards, 43receiving yards, 41kick–return yards, and caught a 25–yard touchdown pass. Both Johnson and Avery received the Most Valuable Player award for their respective teams.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{jumped out}} to a quick 28–7 lead {{in the first two}} {{quarters}} of play, but the Hokies closed the lead to a 28–14 margin by halftime with a 3-yard run from Vick. In the second half, Tech made its biggest run of the game as Kicker Shayne Graham kicked a field goal and <b>tailback</b> Andre Kendrick added two rushing touchdowns to give the Hokies their first and only lead—29–28—with just over three minutes left in the third quarter. But in the end, the Hokies could not contain Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke, who threw twotouchdowns in the fourth quarter and 329yards in the game. The Seminoles defeated Virginia Tech 46–29.|$|E
50|$|On 23 January 2004 long <b>tailbacks</b> {{resulted}} {{on both the}} Devon and Cornwall sides of the Tamar Bridge when Jolly Stanesby and other protesters climbed onto a 20ft-high gantry. He spent a week camped above the Tamar Bridge but walked free from court.|$|R
50|$|Quarterback Patrick Towles added a TD {{passing and}} running in his first career start for Kentucky, which outgained the Skyhawks 656-398. The Wildcats' sophomore threw for 370 yards, but Kentucky's <b>tailbacks</b> set the tone by flying through huge holes and scoring {{virtually}} untouched.|$|R

5|$|<b>Tailback</b> Cedric Humes {{was named}} the most {{valuable}} player of the game for Virginia Tech, and quarterback Hunter Cantwell {{was named the}} Cardinals' most valuable player. Tech punter Nic Schmitt set Gator Bowl records for punt yardage and average punt distance, kicking the ball six times for 300yards, an average of 50yards per kick. Virginia Tech's win was marred by excessive penalties and unsportsmanlike conduct that resulted in the ejection of oneplayer. Following the game, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was released from the team as a result of several incidents of misconduct, including a stomp on Louisville defender Elvis Dumervil's leg during the game. Several players who participated in the game, including Dumervil, later went on to careers in the National Football League.|$|E
5|$|The {{two teams}} met for a Thursday night game at Blacksburg, {{a time and}} site where the Hokies have {{traditionally}} excelled. In the first quarter, Maryland drove 56yards, but was held to a 46-yard field goal attempt, which was missed by Obi Egekeze. In the next series, Tech quarterback Sean Glennon led the Hokies on an 80-yard drive that culminated in a short pass to Greg Boone for a score. The next series went into the second quarter, and Maryland was again forced to attempt a field goal, which was made good. Hokies <b>tailback</b> Darren Evans then broke away for a 50-yard carry to the Maryland 30-yard line, and later capped it with a one-yard rush into the endzone. Before the half, Tech managed a field goal to expand their lead, 17–3.|$|E
5|$|In Alabama's {{first trip}} to Lexington since 2004, and their first road game of the 2009 season, the Tide {{defeated}} the Kentucky Wildcats 38–20. Alabama scored on their opening drive after Javier Arenas returned the opening kickoff 60 yards, which set up an 11-yard Mark Ingram touchdown for an early 7–0 lead. Kentucky responded {{with a pair of}} 49-yard Lones Seiber field goals. The score was 7–6 {{at the end of the}} first quarter. The Tide extended their lead late in the second quarter following a nearly seven-minute, 13-play, 97-yard touchdown drive. Greg McElroy passes of 27 and 21 yards and a 13-yard run by Ingram moved Bama down the field, culminating with a three-yard touchdown pass from McElroy to Colin Peek to put the Tide up 14–6. With only 40 seconds remaining in the half, Kentucky <b>tailback</b> Derrick Locke fumbled the ball after catching a short pass. Courtney Upshaw returned 45 yards for an Alabama touchdown that put the Tide ahead 21–6 at halftime.|$|E
5000|$|Garrett {{signaled}} {{the dawn of}} the [...] "Tailback U" [...] era, where USC produced a stream of top <b>tailbacks</b> included Heisman winners O. J.
