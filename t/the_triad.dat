5|$|An unusual triad {{is found}} in seldolisin proteases. The low pKa of the {{glutamate}} carboxylate group means that it only acts as a base in <b>the</b> <b>triad</b> at very low pH. <b>The</b> <b>triad</b> is hypothesised to be an adaptation to specific environments like acidic hot springs (e.g. kumamolysin) or cell lysosome (e.g. tripeptidyl peptidase).|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{augmented}} <b>triad</b> {{differs from}} <b>the</b> {{other kinds of}} <b>triad</b> (<b>the</b> major <b>triad,</b> <b>the</b> minor <b>triad,</b> and <b>the</b> diminished <b>triad)</b> in {{that it does not}} naturally arise in a diatonic scale. Although it could be conceptualized as a <b>triad</b> built on <b>the</b> third degree of a harmonic minor scale or melodic minor scale, it virtually never occurs in this way (since any chord on the third degree is itself rare, usually being a new tonic).|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} release, the Landlord {{is brought to}} <b>the</b> <b>triad</b> boss, who {{increases}} his offer to HK$30 million for the baby. He finds Thongs and Octopus at the hospital, where the baby is being treated for fever. The Landlord informs the two of the triads' latest offer, but Thongs and Octopus {{are more concerned about}} the baby's welfare than the cash. However, the two agree to bring the baby to <b>the</b> <b>triad</b> boss' mansion, where the Landlord will meet them {{with the rest of the}} money. They reach <b>the</b> <b>triad</b> boss' mansion and hand over the baby reluctantly. As the trio are about to leave, they hear the baby crying for them as a blood sample is taken from his arm. Thongs and Octopus experience a flashback of the days they spent with the baby. Overcome by their feelings, they fight their way into <b>the</b> <b>triad</b> boss' private amusement park to recover the baby while the Landlord leaves with the money. Thongs almost manages to escape with the baby, but is forced to surrender when the triads threaten to hurl Octopus to his death.|$|E
5|$|With the Halliwells' help, Billie {{attempts}} to help Christy reintegrate back into {{everyday life and}} to gain control over her powers. Billie and the Halliwells are unaware of Christy's collaboration with <b>the</b> <b>Triad.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Triad</b> identifies Billie as the Ultimate Power, which was foreshadowed in earlier episodes as the season's big bad, and refers to Christy {{as the key to}} unlocking Billie's power. <b>The</b> <b>Triad</b> arranges for Christy's parents to be killed by a pair of Noxon demons (John Rosenfeld and David S. Lee), believing prolonged contact with them could sway her morality to the side of good. Billie becomes angry by the Halliwell sisters when they decide to interrogate the demons to gather more information about the Ultimate Power rather than killing them to avenge her parents' deaths. Christy uses Billie's feeling of betrayal to turn her against the Charmed Ones. Billie and Christy vanquish the Noxon demons, who were previously believed to be invincible, and the Halliwell sisters realize that Billie is the Ultimate Power.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, German {{physician}} and pathologist Rudolf Virchow published what {{is referred to}} as Virchow's triad, the three major causes of thrombosis. <b>The</b> <b>triad</b> provides the theoretical framework for the current explanation of venous thrombosis, although it was focused on the effect of a foreign body in the venous system and the conditions required for clot propagation.|$|E
50|$|However, by this time, Wing {{has been}} kidnapped by <b>the</b> <b>Triads</b> for not paying the $10,000 owed {{to them for}} getting her into the States. The boys go after Wing to get back their client. Both <b>the</b> <b>Triads</b> and <b>the</b> boys are unaware of the other's intentions; the boys mistake <b>the</b> <b>Triads</b> for <b>the</b> Creative Artists Agency, the agency that stole Token, while <b>the</b> <b>Triads</b> think <b>the</b> boys are a rival group. In a shootout at the Triads' headquarters, Kenny is killed, and Kyle {{inadvertently}} manages to kill two Triad guards. Stan concludes with a monologue about how Wing {{is a human being}} and that people's lives should not be sold as commodities which makes the boys and <b>the</b> <b>Triads</b> realize that their businesses are dirty and exploit the hopes of others. They all decide to quit and go to listen to Wing sing at the wedding, only to find Token waiting tables, trying to earn enough money to get back home as CAA did nothing for him.|$|R

5|$|Li, Ah Jong, and Jennie wait in {{a church}} for Fung Sei to return with Ah Jong's money. Fung Sei arrives with the money, horribly beaten by Wong Hoi's gangsters who have {{followed}} him. He is mortally wounded when the hitmen barge into the church. After Ah Jong ends Fung Sei's misery with a mercy killing, he and Li engage in a long and bloody shootout with <b>the</b> <b>Triad</b> all over the church. The battle ends with a Mexican standoff between Ah Jong, Li and Wong Hoi. Ah Jong manages to wound Wong Hoi, but <b>the</b> <b>Triad</b> leader lands two bullets in Ah Jong's eye sockets before the latter dies of his wounds. When a police squadron arrives in the scene, Wong Hoi begs {{to be taken into}} custody. Frustrated by the outcome of the battle, Li fatally shoots Wong Hoi. But afterwards, Li is humiliated and arrested by the police who all have witnessed his misconduct. Worst of all, he is terminated from his career. As the result, he mourns Ah Jong while facing prison. In the end nobody ends happily.|$|E

The publication is solely focusing on design management and has become the flagship publication of the discipline.|$|E
5|$|The same triad {{has also}} convergently evolved in α/β hydrolases such as some lipases and esterases, however {{orientation}} of <b>the</b> <b>triad</b> members is reversed. Additionally, brain acetyl hydrolase (which {{has the same}} fold as a small G-protein) has also {{been found to have}} this triad. The equivalent Serine-Histidine-Glutamate triad is used in acetylcholinesterase.|$|E
5|$|The {{sophistication of}} the active site network causes {{residues}} involved in catalysis (and residues in contact with these) to be highly evolutionarily conserved. However, there are examples of divergent evolution in catalytic triads, both in the reaction catalysed, and the residues used in catalysis. <b>The</b> <b>triad</b> remains {{the core of the}} active site, but it is evolutionarily adapted to serve different functions.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>triad</b> of {{cytomegalovirus}} protease uses histidine as {{both the}} acid and base triad members. Removing the acid histidine results in only a 10-fold activity loss (compared to >10,000-fold when aspartate is removed from chymotrypsin). This triad has been interpreted as a possible way of generating a less active enzyme to control cleavage rate.|$|E

The images are made of neem wood in an {{unfinished}} form. The stumps of wood which form {{the images of the}} brothers have human arms, while that of Subhadra does not have any arms. The heads are large, painted and non-carved. The faces are marked with distinctive large circular eyes.|$|E
5|$|Driven to {{help her}} secure the money for a sight-saving corneal transplant, he accepts one final hit. Li Ying, a police detective, spots Ah Jong {{completing}} the job but the assassin escapes. Triad boss Hay Wong Hoi double crosses Ah Jong, and instead of paying him, sends a group of hitmen to kill him. During Ah Jong's escape from <b>the</b> <b>Triad,</b> a young child is injured by a stray bullet. After dispatching the attackers, Ah Jong rushes the child to the hospital while being followed by Li and his partner Sgt. Tsang Yeh. Once the child regains consciousness at the casualty ward, Ah Jong escapes Li and Tsang.|$|E

5000|$|Zhu {{once used}} the term [...] "patriotic organizations" [...] {{in a speech in}} the mid-1990s to {{describe}} <b>the</b> <b>triads,</b> citing their past history as secret societies in resisting foreign invaders and playing a key role in Chinese history. This was interpreted by some observers as indicating a cultural connection between <b>the</b> <b>triads</b> and <b>the</b> Communist Party.|$|R
5|$|Even though Kern {{intended}} for the character's morality to be left ambiguous and to the viewer's interpretation, a majority of television commentators characterized Christy as an antagonist. Brittany Spanos of Vulture.com determined that Christy was an evil witch due to her betrayal of Billie and the Charmed Ones, and SpoilerTV's Gavin Hetherington identified her as the season's big bad. In their book The Book of Three, authors Diana G. Gallagher and Paul Ruditis wrote that she served as the Triad's protégée. Ruditis followed this up in a later interview by calling Christy a pawn {{under the control of}} <b>the</b> <b>Triad</b> rather than a proper villain; he found that the series lacked a strong, female antagonist.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif. Several {{families}} of cysteine proteases use this triad set, for example TEV protease and papain. <b>The</b> <b>triad</b> acts similarly to serine protease triads, {{with a few}} notable differences. Due to cysteine's low pKa, {{the importance of the}} Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. hepatitis A virus protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain). This triad is also used by some amidases, such as N-glycanase to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.|$|E
5|$|This unusual triad occurs only in one {{superfamily}} of amidases. In this case, the lysine acts to polarise {{the middle}} serine. The middle serine then forms two strong hydrogen bonds to the nucleophilic serine to activate it (one {{with the side}} chain hydroxyl {{and the other with}} the backbone amide). The middle serine is held in an unusual cis orientation to facilitate precise contacts with the other two triad residues. <b>The</b> <b>triad</b> is further unusual in that the lysine and cis-serine both act as the base in activating the catalytic serine, but the same lysine also performs the role of the acid member as well as making key structural contacts.|$|E
