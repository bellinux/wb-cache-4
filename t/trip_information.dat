30|$|The {{trip and}} traffic information, {{in terms of}} tour lengths and travel times, that is needed as an input for the COPERT models is {{retrieved}} {{from one of the}} above-mentioned online navigation service providers via the available application programming interface. 1 Some online navigation service providers offer the possibility to retrieve <b>trip</b> <b>information</b> for the desired origin–destination pairs for the moment of the request or, alternatively, for a specific weekday and time of day. In the latter case, the response contains averaged/smoothed data corresponding to the typical situation for the selected weekday and time of day, without exceptional conditions. In order to ensure the representativeness of the delivered day- and time-typical travel information, navigation service providers use different statistical techniques [31]. All analyses presented in this paper are based on day- and time-typical <b>trip</b> <b>information</b> as this is in line with this research’s understanding of regular traffic congestion.|$|E
40|$|Drive modes are driver-selectable pre-set {{configurations}} of powertrain and certain vehicle parameters. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) typically feature special options of drive modes {{that can affect}} the hybrid energy source management system, for example, electric vehicle (EV) mode (that draws fully on battery) and charge sustaining (CS) mode (that utilizes internal combustion engine to charge battery while propelling the vehicle). This paper studies an optimization problem to enable the driver to select the appropriate drive modes for fuel minimization. We develop optimization algorithms that optimize the decisions of drive modes based on <b>trip</b> <b>information,</b> and integrated with path planning to find an optimal path, considering intermediate filling and charging stations. We further provide an online algorithm {{that is based on}} the revealed <b>trip</b> <b>information.</b> We evaluate our algorithms empirically on a Chevrolet Volt, which shows significant fuel savings.

30|$|The {{modeling}} of PEV behavior {{is the basis}} for the energy management with PEV, as well as charging and discharging control. For the sake of transportation, the charging/discharging behavior is based on owner habits and trip needs, so the behavior is featured with stochastic valuation and the time for active energy management is limited. However, in a certain resident district [11, 14], large-scale stochastic trips of PEVs can be statistically described with the probability distribution according to their daily habits. Thus, it is possible to simulate the <b>trip</b> <b>information</b> of large-scale PEVs.|$|E

30|$|A {{question}} was asked {{in our survey}} about the TES: “How satisfied do you feel with your current life,…, and the transportation system?” One statement is “Travel environment in the city.” The options are “Not satisfied at all,” “Not satisfied,” “Slightly satisfied,” “Moderately satisfied,” and “Extremely satisfied.” About 30  % respondents presented their dissatisfaction of transportation environment, and 24  % respondents felt satisfied. The following {{question was}} asked about the TTS: “Are you satisfied with your usual travel time for your most frequent trips?” The options are the same as the former one. The information of travelers’ most frequent trips were required. The most frequent trips could be a trip from home to work (or work to home), or a non-work trip, but it should always have the same trip purpose and the same (single) origin and destination. The reason to ask for the most frequent <b>trips</b> <b>information</b> is that, we want to get more exact information like departure time, trip origin, and destination for a special trip which will not change by different purpose or trip distance. And the most frequent trip will be the most familiar trip in travelers’ daily trips which impact them most. For this question, about 20  % respondents report that they are satisfied or unsatisfied with their travel time for the most frequent trips, respectively.|$|R
