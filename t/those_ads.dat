2500|$|Jhally (1989) and Jackson (2009) on {{the other}} hand do not see the {{portrayal}} of women being objectified as a commodity or [...] "hot lesbians" [...] necessarily wrong. Not in the literal sense, but advertisements are reflective of what our views are. In turn, this may open up women who were unsure of their sexuality (even though most lesbians would state that they were lesbians from birth) and let them experiment without the boundaries. As an example, older advertisements from the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s are made up of ideologies of what men wanted, and what they believed to be their ultimate dreams. <b>Those</b> <b>ads</b> supposedly portrayed what women dreamed about, when really this was only because they were being told what to dream about by men. Women were just heterosexual in everyone's eyes, as being lesbian was a major taboo during that time. Lesbians were always in the background, just not front-and-centre. Nowadays, you have postfeminist women who want to be free from labels, experiment sexually, and use fashionable lesbianism in advertising as it does not affect their heterosexual ways. It has become a [...] "fad", or [...] "cool" [...] to be bi-curious, or tri-sexual. This, in turn, may open up other avenues for women who were once shunned upon. Sexuality and gender have been elevated to a privileged position in our cultural discourse, and thus powerful media campaigns only further this cause. It is natural that the [...] "hot lesbian" [...] would be at the forefront because sex always sells, and the [...] "hot lesbian" [...] theme in advertising is what is taking place now. As such, people can view the advertisements as just advertisements, or it can pique their curiosity.|$|E

40|$|Background: Disproportionate medial {{temporal}} lobe atrophy (MTA) {{is an early}} finding in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Episodic memory impairment in AD {{is associated with the}} degree of MTA. Episodic memory impairment and MTA are also found in semantic dementia (SD) and in right {{temporal lobe}} atrophy (RTLA), the temporal variants of frontotemporal dementia, but their relationship is unclear. Objective: To compare episodic memory impairment among patients with these temporal variants of frontotemporal dementia with that of patients with AD with the same degree of MTA. Methods: Episodic memory was tested with the visual association test, and semantic memory (SM) with animal fluency and the visual association naming test. MTA was measured using a visual rating scale. Each patient with SD or RTLA was matched for MTA with two patients with AD. Comparisons of episodic memory and SM were made for patients with SD versus matched patients with AD; patients with RTLA versus matched patients with AD and for SD, RTLA and all patients with AD. Results: 27 patients with SD and 11 with RTLA were matched with 54 and 22 patients with AD, respectively. Episodic memory was less impaired in patients with SD than in <b>those</b> with <b>AD</b> (8 versus 2; p< 0. 001) and in patients with RTLA than in <b>those</b> with <b>AD</b> (10 versus 4. 5; p= 0. 009). Semantic memory was more affected in patients with SD than in <b>those</b> with <b>AD,</b> and the Mini Mental State Examination score was higher in patients with RTLA than in <b>those</b> with <b>AD.</b> Comparison of the three diagnostic groups showed that episodic memory was most impaired in AD, whereas SM was most impaired in SD. Conclusion: Since episodic memory impairment is more severe in AD than in SD and RTLA, despite a comparable degree of MTA, atrophy of the medial temporal lobe alone cannot account for episodic memory dysfunction...|$|R

MethodsHealthy elderly control (HC) subjects and patients with MCI or AD were recorded while performing several short cognitive vocal tasks. The voice recordings were processed, and the first vocal markers were extracted using speech signal processing techniques. Second, the vocal markers were tested to assess their “power” to distinguish among HC, MCI, and AD. The second step included training automatic classifiers for detecting MCI and AD, using machine learning methods and testing the detection accuracy. ResultsThe classification accuracy of automatic audio analyses were as follows: between HCs and those with MCI, 79 % ±  5 %; between HCs and <b>those</b> with <b>AD,</b> 87 % ±  3 %; and between those with MCI and <b>those</b> with <b>AD,</b> 80 % ±  5 %, demonstrating its assessment utility.

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about suicidal {{ideation}} and behaviours in adjustment disorder (AD). In this paper we sought to examine the variables independently associated with suicidal ideation and behaviour in patients diagnosed with AD or depressive (DE) episode among psychiatric outpatients and in liaison psychiatry. Methods: 370 patients who were referred to the liaison psychiatry services (including those seen in the Emergency Department) at 3 Dublin hospitals, and were clinically diagnosed with either DE or AD, based on the ICD 10 diagnostic criteria, were recruited to the study. We examined their demographic and clinical characteristics, and the associations between these and suicidal ideation and behaviour on multivariate analysis. Results: Younger age, single marital status, and greater severity of depressive symptoms {{were significantly associated with}} suicidality across both diagnoses. On multivariate analysis, greater severity of depressive symptoms was associated with suicidality in <b>those</b> with <b>AD</b> (p= 0. 012) and DE (p= 0. 009). <b>Those</b> with <b>AD</b> exhibited suicidality at lower symptom scores than did those with DE but in both groups it still occurred at the highest level of severity. There were differences in the objective circumstances measure of suicide intent. Limitations: We used clinical diagnosis rather as the main diagnostic classification. The generalisability of this paper may be limited to consultation-liaison psychiatry settings, where suicidal ideation and behaviours are common. Conclusions: Suicidality in AD and DE has broadly similar risk factors but differ in aspects of suicide intent. Different mechanisms may underpin suicidality in <b>those</b> with <b>AD</b> compared to DE...|$|R
