5|$|Avadhi, {{which is}} a dialect of Hindi, is {{primarily}} from a region in Uttar Pradesh. It was chosen to give <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> language spoken during that era. However, the language was diluted, and modern viewers can understand it. The dialogues, which were a combination of three dialects (Avadhi, Bhojpuri and Braj Bhasha) were penned by Hindi writer K. P.

5|$|Many fans wanted Snake Eater {{to use a}} 3D camera, {{but this}} was {{ultimately}} not implemented in the game. Kojima views Metal Gear Solid, Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater as a trilogy, and wished to keep the camera {{the same as the}} previous two in order to keep <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three games the same. He did, however, acknowledge that the current trend for video games is to use the 3D camera. The camera was later implemented in an updated version of Snake Eater titled , and further installments in the franchise.|$|E

5|$|From 21 April 2001, Live & Kicking began {{broadcasting}} from BBC Scotland in Glasgow and saw Farley, Cawood and Deley {{joined by}} Heather Suttie who replaced Hill. The set {{remained the same}} after having been transported up to Glasgow from London, however a new seating area was added, consisting of pouffes and beanbags. <b>The</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show also changed and was also split into three sections. The first hour became Kicking Toons which bunched all the cartoons together, the next hour would feature {{the main components of}} Live & Kicking including the games and sketches and the final hour became Live & Loud which featured all the music performances.|$|E
5|$|Nidhogg is a side-scrolling two-player {{fighting}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Messhof. Players duel with swords in a pixelated environment. The game was commissioned for the New York University Game Center's annual multiplayer show, and was revised and demoed at private events {{over the next four}} years before its final release. It won Indiecade 2013's Game Design award and the 2011 Independent Games Festival's Nuovo award. It was released for Microsoft Windows on January 13, 2014, and later ported to OS X, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita. Critics praised <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gameplay and its balance, but considered its single-player mode unsatisfying. Messhof released a sequel in 2017 with a higher resolution art style and additional weapons and arenas.|$|E
5|$|The team {{tried to}} capture <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} game with updated graphics and {{sounds in the}} demo. It was to feature ten short interactive scenes from Chrono Trigger. Despite receiving requests from fans, the development team {{did not intend to}} create a complete remake of the original game since they would not have the necessary resources, and because they thought the result would not have been on par with Square Enix-developed titles. The story of the game was altered slightly to allow for the ten scenes to better flow from one to the other.|$|E

To help give more personality to the 3D-rendered animation, Gibson applied traditional methods used in 2D limited animation, such as smear animation, instead of relying on motion blur effects, creating more exaggerated animations that support <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, Goldsmith {{scored the}} Michael Crichton film, Runaway, the composer's first all-electronic score. In an {{interview}} with Keyboard Magazine in 1984, Goldsmith said {{that in order to}} simulate the ambiance of a real orchestra, several speakers were set up in an actual orchestra hall similar to how they would be arranged if they were live players. The playback was re-recorded to capture <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> games, Gans had the sound designer of the original Silent Hill, Akira Yamaoka, flown to the set several times. Additionally, Gans had a 40-inch television brought onto the set, to which he attached a PlayStation 2; Gans then played the original Silent Hill on the system so that the actors and cinematographers could see how Gans wanted to emulate various camera angles and movements.|$|E

25|$|When {{the waves}} were flat, surfers persevered with {{sidewalk}} surfing, {{which is now}} called skateboarding. Sidewalk surfing has a similar feel to surfing and requires only a paved road or sidewalk. To create <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wave, surfers even sneak into empty backyard swimming pools to ride in, known as pool skating. Eventually, surfing {{made its way to}} the slopes with the invention of the Snurfer, later credited as the first snowboard. Many other board sports have been invented over the years, but all can trace their heritage back to surfing.|$|E

The {{northern part of}} Little Italy is less densely populated than {{the southern part of}} Little Italy, which is mainly made up of high-rise and mid-rise buildings. Some older buildings have been renovated for new uses; newer buildings aim to duplicate <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original establishments. The main street, India Street, features public art and plazas, street trees, galleries and antique stores, and numerous restaurants with outside eating areas.|$|E
25|$|In September 2010, {{the team}} {{revealed}} {{the first piece}} of concept art for the protagonists, created by artist Ryan Jones and based on actors Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, who allowed their likenesses to be used for the in-game characters. Season designer and writer Michael Stemmle emphasized that the game's graphics would take a less realistic and more stylized approach while trying to stay true to <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trilogy. The puzzles were designed to rely on applying items in the inventory to characters and objects as the developers did not think of Marty as a protagonist that would build a gadget from various parts.|$|E

25|$|Eurasian magpie (Pica pica): The Eurasian magpie is {{the only}} non-mammal to have passed the mirror test. Researchers applied a small red, yellow or black sticker to the throat of five Eurasian magpies, {{where they could be}} seen by the bird only by using a mirror. The birds were then given a mirror. <b>The</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sticker on their throats did not seem to alarm the magpies. However, when the birds with {{coloured}} stickers caught a glimpse of themselves in the mirror, they scratched at their throats—a clear indication that they recognised the image in the mirror as their own. Those that received a black sticker, invisible against the black neck feathers, did not react.|$|E
25|$|Something of <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> university's quality can {{be gained}} {{from the work of}} some of its professors. Among them were Estius (Willem Hessels van Est), (1542–1613), the {{commentator}} on the Pauline epistles. He had studied classics at Utrecht and afterwards spent some twenty years at Louvain, in the study of philosophy, theology and Holy Scripture, and in 1580 received the degree of Doctor of Theology. In 1582 he became Professor of Theology at Douai, a position which he retained for thirty-one years and which he combined for the last eighteen years of his life with that of Chancellor of the University, in addition to being for many years rector of the diocesan seminary. Estius's works were written in Latin and for the greater part published posthumously.|$|E
25|$|Brodovitch {{released}} {{a book of}} these photographs in 1945, titled simply Ballet, through a small New York publisher. The book contains 104 photographs of several ballets and is divided into eleven segments, one for each ballet performance. On the contents page, Brodovitch introduces each chapter in a typographic style that emulates <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dance it is describing. He photographed with a Contax 35mm camera, no flash, and with a slow film speed. The blurred figures of the dancers allow the viewer to not only feel the music, but also to follow {{the line of the}} dancer's limbs mid-step. The images beautifully capture the atmosphere on-stage, the frenzied behind-the-scenes action backstage, and the magical moments of the ballet. By bleeding the blurred, grainy pictures off the pages and into the gutters, he communicated the emotional impact of the dance without words.|$|E

25|$|The x-ray {{diffraction}} {{of a sample}} from an unfired lump of pottery clay excavated at the Zebree (3MS20) site confirmed that the shell was burned before being added to the raw clay. Burning the shells eliminates the organic binder and the cooled, burnt shells are easily crushed into a shell temper of fine plate-like particles, some nearly powder. The hinges of the shells are discarded. Using burned shells is logical as unburned mussel shells are hard and very durable. In terms of soil technology, the addition of shell (calcium carbonate) {{has the effect of}} neutralizing the ionic charge of the clay particles. During the course of replicative pottery experiments, as the shell was added to the clay in the presence of water, distinct and immediate changes took place in <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clay. With the valence neutral, the clay-temper combination produces a very satisfactory pottery clay. This modification of backswamp clay - particles now clumping instead of constantly slipping - into a well-behaved modeling clay would have been immediately noticed by the experienced prehistoric potter.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E
