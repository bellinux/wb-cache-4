If the expectations are met, a second date might be in the future, but only if the man is feeling the same thing.|$|E

25|$|In 1995 {{the first}} Faroese patient with {{systemic}} primary carnitine deficiency (SPCD) was diagnosed. Later other patients were found, {{but nothing was}} done <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> illness was common or if something should be done about it. Not until 2008 when a young woman died {{just a few days}} after being diagnosed with SPCD (in the Faroes, the illness is named CTD), actions were finally taken by the Faroese health authorities. The young woman had not been treated, and this caused a big discussion about how to prevent this from happening again. Shortly after, all Faroese people in the Faroes were invited to take a blood sample for a small cost and get it screened for SPCD. Several persons with the illness were found and got treatment immediately. It is now known that several Faroese people have died a sudden death at a young age because of this illness. Around one third of the Faroese population has been screened for SPCD (with a blood sample), and scientists think {{that at least one of}} every 1000 inhabitants of the Faroes have the illness. There have also been found elderly people who have survived the illness without treatment. The treatment is to give the patients carnitine supplement. The German physician and scientist Ulrike Steurwald, who has done research in the Faroe Islands for several years, has argued that the Faroese diet of red meat, like sheep meat and whale meat which contain high amounts of carnitine, may have protected many Faroese people from a sudden death at a young age from SPCD. The whale meat contains nutritions like carnitine, taurine and selenium. The concentration of selenium in raw fresh cod fillet and raw fresh pilot whale meat is 28µg/100g and 185µg/100g. The whale's blubber is rich in vitamin D, which around half of the elderly population and many amongst the younger generations in the Faroe Islands are lacking. Reasons for this can be changes from traditional food to pizza, chicken, etc. The fat of sea mammals provide excellent sources of vitamins A, D and E.|$|E

500|$|... "All Mixed Up" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

Hollyoaks worked closely with the University of Central Lancashire's Cyberspace Research Unit on the storyline, in a bid to raise awareness of internet safety. Speaking on behalf of the Research Unit, Dr Jo Bryce commented: [...] "If the storyline can remind one young person to protect themselves when engaging in online activity, then that can only be a positive thing. Too many youngsters think they are immune to online risks and this storyline is a reminder that you don't always know who you're talking to online." [...] Hollyoaks series producer, Paul Marquess, added: [...] "This is a terrifying murder that highlights the dangers of meeting strangers online. The storyline, which launches at Christmas, will take us right through 2011 and audiences will be gripped <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> dangerous killer will strike again." [...] Marquess said he was surprised that the show had not done a big storyline about [...] "stranger danger" [...] on the internet before, branding it [...] "absolutely key Hollyoaks territory". Hollyoaks writer, Steve Hughes, explained that the storyline was inspired by a real-life incident, where a friend had her identity stolen on social networking service Facebook.|$|E
2500|$|Finally the companions of Hasan al-Askari, the {{eleventh}} Imam, also {{believed he had}} a son whose birth, {{like that of the}} prophet Moses was concealed, and due to the belief that he was the promised Muhammad al-Mahdi; Al-Mutamid ordered the house of the Imam to be investigated, and <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Imam had left a son.

The pilgrims said they would accept him if he would prove himself by telling them their names and indicating how much money they had. While Ja'far was protesting against this examination, a servant of al-Mahdi appeared saying that his master had informed him to say that they had certain particular names and definite amount of money.
