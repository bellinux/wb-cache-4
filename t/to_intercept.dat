At about this time 12 Fw190s arrived at Førde Fjord and flew through German flak <b>to</b> <b>intercept</b> the Beaufighters that were waiting their turn to attack. The British Mustangs were taken by surprise, but dived <b>to</b> <b>intercept</b> the German fighters. This led to an intense air battle, with over 50 aircraft either engaged in dogfights or diving to attack the German ships; it was the largest aerial conflict ever fought over Norway.|$|E

5|$|Sailing more {{directly}} than de Grasse, Hood's fleet arrived off {{the entrance to}} the Chesapeake on 25 August. Finding no French ships there, he then sailed for New York. Meanwhile, his colleague and commander of the New York fleet, Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Graves, had spent several weeks trying <b>to</b> <b>intercept</b> a convoy organized by John Laurens to bring much-needed supplies and hard currency from France to Boston. When Hood arrived at New York, he found that Graves was in port (having failed <b>to</b> <b>intercept</b> the convoy), but had only five ships of the line that were ready for battle.|$|E

5|$|McCudden {{had always}} found it {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>intercept</b> high-flying German reconnaissance aircraft.

5|$|Most of the German bombers {{had passed}} over {{and had an}} {{altitude}} advantage over French fighters trying to gain height <b>to</b> <b>intercept.</b> Skirmishes were few and far between, but some French units suffered heavy losses. For the attack, the Germans had used the new C-250 Flammbombe (Flame Bomb) which had only been cleared for use 24 hours earlier. The incendiary bomb did some damage to hangars and parked aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Nike Zeus was an {{anti-ballistic missile}} (ABM) system {{developed}} by the US Army during the late 1950s and early 1960s, designed to destroy Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile warheads before they could hit targets in the United States. It was designed by Bell's Nike team, and was initially based on the earlier Nike Hercules anti-aircraft missile. The original Zeus A, given the tri-service identifier XLIM-49, was designed <b>to</b> <b>intercept</b> warheads in the upper atmosphere, mounting a 25 kiloton W31 nuclear warhead. During development, the concept changed to protect a much larger area and intercept the warheads at higher altitudes. This required the missile to be greatly enlarged into the totally new design, Zeus B, mounting a 400 kiloton W50 warhead. In several successful tests, the B model proved itself able <b>to</b> <b>intercept</b> warheads, and even satellites.|$|E

50|$|As {{encryption}} technology {{increased in}} sophistication, {{by the end}} of the 20th century many coded signals proved unbreakable. Due to this problem, bugging techniques and technologies saw a revival: unable <b>to</b> easily <b>intercept</b> and decrypt foreign communications through passive means, the U.S. government needed <b>to</b> instead <b>intercept</b> the communications at their source, and thus the SCS program was expanded in the 1990s to fulfill this need.|$|R

5|$|On October 14, Japanese {{air forces}} {{attempted}} a reprisal against Task Force 38, but poor weather conditions complicated {{their search for}} the U.S. fleet. Only approximately 25 bombers {{made it to the}} vicinity of Task Group 38.2. VF-18's Combat Air Patrol (CAP), which had been flying above the task group continuously for almost two hours, was vectored <b>to</b> <b>intercept</b> these bombers just outside the task group's picket. They took care of the first formation of twelve bombers that emerged from the clouds. Two recently launched divisions of VF-18 Snooper Anti-Submarine Patrol (SNASP) were also routed <b>to</b> <b>intercept,</b> including one division led by Harris. His division had barely finished grouping up after launch when they sighted a second formation of bombers coming towards the ships. Harris exploded one midair then raked a second, sending it crashing into the sea.|$|E

5|$|On next day, B-24s of 2nd Bomb {{division}} of the Eighth Air Force bombed Gotha. JG 1 (under Oesau), JG 11 and JG 3 were sent <b>to</b> <b>intercept.</b> Due to high winds, the bombers were ahead of the escorts unprotected. Two groups of JG 1 met them before Gotha and 9 B-24s were claimed as a result. Since B-17s of 1st Bomb division also bombed Schweinfurt, other fighter units also arrived <b>to</b> <b>intercept,</b> eventually involving almost all the Western day fighter units of the Luftwaffe. This caused some confusion among pilots landing on airfields other than their own. This tested the directive of Schmid. Oesau led one of two such improvised formations successfully, with the other led by Hauptmann Borris of I./JG 26 Oesau added 4 fighters to his score between January and March 1944, and his tally stood at 117. On 8 May 1944 he claimed a Thunderbolt shot down over Hanover; his last kill.|$|E
5|$|Princess Royal {{provided}} {{support for}} British light forces {{involved in the}} Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on 17 November 1917, but never came within range of any German ships. She sailed with the 1st BCS on 12 December after German destroyers sank seven ships of a Norway-bound convoy, including HMS Partridge, four naval trawlers and four cargo ships earlier that day, but the British were unable <b>to</b> <b>intercept</b> and returned to base the following day. Princess Royal, {{along with the rest}} of the Grand Fleet, sortied on the afternoon of 23 April 1918 after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt <b>to</b> <b>intercept</b> the regular British convoy to Norway. However, the Germans were too far ahead of the British, and no shots were fired. Starting in July 1918, the Grand Fleet was affected by the 1918 flu pandemic; at one point, Princess Royal lacked sufficient healthy crewmen to sail.|$|E
5|$|Starting in late 1917, the Germans {{had begun}} to use surface raiders to attack the British convoys to Scandinavia; this forced the British to send squadrons from the Grand Fleet to escort the convoys. On 6 February 1918, the 6th Battle Squadron and eight British destroyers escorted a convoy of {{merchant}} ships to Norway. While steaming off Stavanger on the 8th, Delaware was attacked twice by a German U-boat, though evasive maneuvers allowed Delaware to escape undamaged. The squadron was back in Scapa Flow on 10 February; Delaware escorted two more such convoys in March and April. On 22–24 April, the German High Seas Fleet sortied <b>to</b> <b>intercept</b> one of the convoys {{in the hope of}} cutting off and destroying the escorting battleship squadron.
