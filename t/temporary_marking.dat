40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} for a mark-recapture experiment with ancillary observations obtained from marked animals any time between capture periods {{and throughout the}} geographic range of the animals. The model allows three types of emigration from the site where recaptures are made: (1) random emigration, where the probability an animal is at risk of capture at i {{does not depend on}} whether it was at risk of capture at i - 1, (2) permanent emigration where animals can leave the area where they are at risk of capture but not return, and (3) Markov emigration, where the probability an animal is at risk of capture at i depends on whether it was at risk of capture at i - 1. Under random emigration the likelihood function can be factored into a set of conditionally independent binomial terms used to estimate the parameters and a set of conditionally independent multihypergeometric terms that do not involve the parameters. Closed-form maximum likelihood estimators are derived under random emigration for models with age-dependence and a <b>temporary</b> <b>marking</b> effect. Contingency table based goodness-of-fit tests are derived from the multihypergeometric terms in the likelihood function. Contingency table tests of the age-dependence and <b>temporary</b> <b>marking</b> effect models are also derived. Explicit estimators do not appear to exist for permanent or Markov emigration. It is shown that the estimator suggested by Jolly (Biometrika 52 : 239, 1965), and as a consequence the estimator suggested by Buckland (Biometrics 36 : 419 - 435, 1980), is only valid if there is no emigration from the study area or if emigration is random. The estimator suggested by Mardekian and McDonald (Journal of Wildlife Management 45 : 484 - 488, 1981) for joint analysis of recapture and tag-recovery data is also only valid under no emigration or random emigration. By making appropriate constraints on parameters the models reduce to previously published models including the Jolly-Seber model (with age-dependence and a <b>temporary</b> <b>marking</b> effect), tag-resight models, tag-recovery models, and joint live-recapture/ tag-recovery models. Thus, the model provides a common framework for most widely-used mark-recapture models and allows simultaneous analysis of data obtained in several ways. Advantages of the new models include improved precision of parameter estimates, and the ability to distinguish between different type of emigration. FORTRAN programmes are developed for fitting the models to data with an application to a data set for brown trout (Salmo trutta) tagged in spawning tributaries of Lake Brunner, Westland between 1987 and 1991...|$|E

40|$|Like many {{pinniped}} species, southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) {{are conducive}} to long-term population studies using mark-recapture techniques. The twenty-four year longitudinal dataset at sub-Antarctic Marion Island has already provided much insight into elephant seal population dynamics. However, {{a limitation of}} the present dataset is that mother / pup relatedness cannot be examined because pups are only tagged after their tagged mothers have abandoned them. We test the usefulness of two different <b>temporary</b> <b>marking</b> techniques (tagging and 'strapping'), and four different marker types over two consecutive breeding seasons for use on pups with attending marked mothers.

40|$|Holistic {{studies of}} {{mammalian}} life history factors and their consequences on population demography require an intensive, multifaceted field methodology and effort over long temporal scales. A 25 -year longitudinal mark-recapture experiment on southern elephant seals, Mirounga leonina, at Subantarctic Marion Island provide such {{a foundation for}} demographic analyses and relevant methodology advancement. Two gaps in the methodology related to life history and population demographic research are, the absence of large samples of known mass individuals, and an inability to identify mother-pup relatedness. A novel three-dimensional photogrammetric technique is designed here that allows for mass estimation of large samples of southern elephant seals in the field. An effective <b>temporary</b> <b>marking</b> technique for unweaned pups is implemented that allows for identification of large samples of pups with known mothers prior to the maternal bond being severed at weaning. These known pups can then be marked with more robust tags and relatedness information is preserved long-term. Thus, mass estimates can now be applied as covariates in modelling analyses to address questions of, for example, maternal investment, kinship associated behaviour, and the consequences thereof on survival and reproductive parameters. The state change in the Marion Island southern elephant seal population from decrease to stabilisation/increase is shown to have resulted from improved survivorship in both juvenile and adult female age classes. Male seals of all ages did not indicate improved survivorship following the period of decline. The inflexion in survivorship is identified as 1994, whence improved survivorship of juvenile seals preceded that of young adult females. This inflexion in survivorship is postulated to {{have resulted in a}} population trend inflexion around 1998. Female southern elephant seals do not show evidence of actuarial senescence, but reproductive senescence is apparent after 12 years of age. A longterm reproductive cost (reduced breeding effort) is associated with early primiparity (age three) as compared with later primiparity (4 - 5 - or 6 -year-old). The mean proportion of 3 -year-old breeders has not increased after 1994 as has been hypothesized in previous studies. Contrary to previous assumptions, females do not as a rule breed every year. Annually interrupted breeding efforts are more common than consecutive breeding efforts. No difference in the proportions of interrupted versus uninterrupted breeding efforts was identified between periods of population decline and stabilisation/increase. Longevity as predicted by survival estimates exceeds the observed frequencies. This study provides unique longevity and fertility schedules for the species. The improved survivorship, reproductive senescence and breeding schedules of female southern elephant seals in this population provide groundwork for reevaluation of previous studies and their conclusions. The addition of relatedness and body condition information will allow for sophisticated multistate modelling of population demography in future studies. However, analytical procedures and techniques employed need to be meticulously designed and thoroughly thought through to avoid mis-interpretation of biological data. In addition to a multistate single species analytical approach, the importance of an ecosystem approach to species population demographic studies is highlighted through the augmenting of data on relevant potential drivers of population change, such as killer whales, Orcinus orca.
